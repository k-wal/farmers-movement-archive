Terming the private space industry “nascent”, the Department of Space (DoS), on behalf of IN-SPACe has communicated to various Isro centres to collate details of such personnel. “IN-SPACe seeks the information of retired/resigned S&T personnel of DoS or Isro centres or units along with their willingness to be approached by non-governmental entities (NGEs), which is proposed to be made available to all NGEs through IN-SPACe,” a circular issued by Praveen S, deputy secretary, DoS, reads. TOI has a copy of the circular. The circular, while pointing out that the space industry in India is in a nascent stage, reads that there is, therefore, a need to have a comprehensive directory of knowledge and skilled workers in the space sector which would prove beneficial to the nation's private players, helping them in their space activities. IN-SPACe chairperson Pawan Goenka told TOI: “...The private sector needs help as they won’t have the luxury of spending as much time as Isro did to achieve what it has. In this background, we found that there are so many very well qualified and trained scientists who are not with Isro anymore but would be willing to contribute. So, we thought it would be good if there’s a dedicated directory that can help companies.” He stressed that IN-SPACe would not be recommending anyone or be part of the recruitment process but would only be putting together a list of former Isro personnel — with a half-page or one-page biography — with their consent. “...The rest will be between companies and the individuals. We found that some firms already had such people and realised that not all would be able to access highly trained individuals. Also, from the Isro and IN-SPACe point of view, we think that if startups or new firms have such expertise and are mentored, their proposals will also be more mature and won’t require going back and forth,” Goenka added. Goenka said that while in the first phase IN-SPACe is looking to create a directory of science and technical personnel, it would also “create a similar database of technicians and floor workers if there was a demand from the industry.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/now-in-space-preparing-ex-isro-staff-directory-to-help-nascent-pvt-cos/articleshow/89142811.cms||Chethan Kumar
---||World||India-born priest becomes youngest consecrated Bishop in Church of England||LONDON: An India-born priest has been ordained as a bishop in the Church of England at a ceremony held at St Paul's Cathedral in London on Tuesday. Aged 43, Saju is now the youngest bishop in the Church of England but not the first of Indian-origin as the current Bishop of Bradwell, Bishop John Perumbalath, was also born in Kerala. The Rt Revd Malayil Lukose Varghese Muthalaly, known as Saju, hitherto vicar of St Mark’s Gillingham, Kent, was born in Kerala and grew up in a leprosy hospital in Bengaluru. He was consecrated by Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby as the next Bishop of Loughborough, in the diocese of Leicester. Family, friends, colleagues and supporters hailing from India, Dubai and Britain gathered at the service where two others were ordained as bishops and two of Saju’s children — Zipp and Abraham — said prayers. Welby congratulated Saju in Hindi on Twitter afterwards. In English he tweeted: “A wonderful, exciting, beautiful day for the @churchofengland — a diverse, global church brought together in the joy of Jesus Christ.” His parents live in Kollam, Kerala. “Our father said God has given him an opportunity to serve beyond boundaries and he should use it well. Our parents — aged 90 and 83 — missed the chance to witness the ceremony due to the pandemic,” said his brother Siji Malayil, a lawyer in the Karnataka high court. As Suffragan Bishop, Saju will share oversight of the diocese with the Bishop of Leicester, the Rt Revd Martyn Snow. Snow said: “Leicester can be rightly proud of our track record of gifting to the wider church bishops who represent different ethnic groups and will help the church to reflect the fullness of life in Christ." Saju, who now carries a bishop’s staff made of Indian rosewood, will be officially installed as Bishop of Loughborough at a service at Brockington Church of England Academy in Enderby, Leicestershire, on February 5. The event will be live-streamed on YouTube. He was born on the Kerala backwaters to a Syrian Orthodox Church family who trace their spiritual and cultural lineage back to St Thomas the Apostle. He said his priorities are people-focused and helping the poor and marginalised flourish. He said: “I spent much of my childhood in a leprosy hospital in Bengaluru where my mother was a nurse serving some of the most ostracised and rejected groups in the world. From my earliest memory, my heart has bent towards those who live in poverty. Poor people aren’t just poor people; they are mothers, artists, gifted leaders, friends, people who are passionate about the environment.” He will have oversight for intercultural communities and racial equity strategy as well as priest vocations. Muthalaly moved to Loughborough just before Christmas with his wife Katy, who he met on a gap year in England, and their four children. “I am never more at home than when I am with Katy, our children, and our eclectic collection of pets," he said. “I am also joyfully at home when I am playing the beautiful game of cricket. I carry this conviction that the game of cricket is the most beautiful contribution the English have made to the world.” He also enjoys running, playing the guitar and cooking. After attending Cambridge school in Vijayanagara, he went on to do his PU (Arts) at Christ PU College in 1996, after which he attended the Southern Asia Bible College in Bengaluru and trained for the ministry at Wycliffe Hall, Oxford. He was ordained priest in 2009. He left for England at the age of 20. “He could have left for England in his late teen years itself… He was an ethnic minority there... He is a self-made man, he built his own career and is thus an inspiration to us. The process (consecration) is a lengthy one at the end of which the British Prime Minister takes a call. It is a proud moment for all of us,” Siji, his brother, said. Muthalaly grew up in Bengaluru in the 1980s and ’90s and lived with his parents, elder brother and sister in HBR Layout “Spirituality was part of our lives, like any other family. It was more a way of life and a matter of discipline with Sunday Mass and Sunday school. We were taught values,” Siji said.

Back in 1992, former Union minister and BJP veteran Murli Manohar Joshi had arrived in Srinagar on Republic Day to hoist the flag at the historic clock tower, only to run into a curfew clamped by the administration in view of terrorist threats. While security forces have been unfurling the tricolour there on all national days, never before Wednesday did a local crowd converge on the city centre to be part of such an event. Two young Kashmiris — activists Sajid Yousuf Shah and Sahil Bashir – were taken to the top of the clock tower by a hydraulic crane to unfurl the flag, followed by the strains of the national anthem. As flower petals rained on the crowd and the tricolour fluttered in the cold winter breeze to the accompaniment of patriotic songs, a loud cheer rent the air. "Since childhood, we have seen the Pakistani flag hoisted on this very clock tower several times. It's a proud moment for me to be part of an occasion when the Indian flag was unfurled in front of an audience like this for the first time in 73 years," Bashir said. The crowd at the event comprised dozens of BJP workers and supporters, many of whom seemed overcome by emotion while witnessing the flag-hoisting ceremony. Young trainees from the Kashmir Martial Arts Academy were among those who participated in the event. Bashir said J&K had witnessed a "lot of the change on the ground" since the nullification of Article 370 in August 2019 took away the erstwhile state's special status. "The hoisting of the national flag atop the clock tower in Lal Chowk in front of a peaceful crowd speaks volumes about the change in the mindset of Kashmiris. This possibly reflects the feelings of what people call 'Naya Kashmir'." Former CM and National Conference vice-president Omar Abdullah took a swipe at the administration for taking down the tricolour from the clock tower well before sundown. "Tricolour disappears in less than a couple of hours. It didn’t even remain there for the day. Why insult the National Flag just for a photo op? Is this what patriotism & nationalism has come to? Photo ops & trolling?" he tweeted. Across Srinagar, more national flags fluttered at various places, including Pratap Park and Iqbal Park, than on any previous Republic Day or Independence Day in memory. Lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha's advisor R R Bhatnagar took the guard of honour at the main Republic Day parade at the cricket stadium in Sonwar. A brief cultural programme was held after the parade to mark the occasion. Republic Day functions at other district headquarters and tehsils of the Valley went off smoothly, watched over by large contingents of security forces. As part of the security drill, internet services on mobile devices had been temporarily barred in some areas of J&K for half the day.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/first-r-day-crowd-in-73-years-watches-flag-hoisting-at-lal-chowk-clock-tower/articleshow/89142917.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||Business||The new Air India: What changes first when Tatas take back their Maharaja||NEW DELHI: Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran on Thursday met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi ahead of the official handover of Air India to the Tata Group. Chandrasekaran also visited the Air India headquarters after the meeting with PM Modi. Shri N Chandrasekaran, the Chairman of Tata Sons called on PM @narendramodi. @TataCompanies https://t.co/7yP8is5ehw— PMO India (@PMOIndia) 1643274814000AI board will meet on Thursday where all the board members will resign to be replaced by nominees of the new owner group. Since security clearances for the new appointees will take time, some key members may be asked to continue. The Tatas have hit the ground running to restore the Maharaja’s lost sheen. The focus is on improving on time performance (OTP) — not exactly the Maharaja’s strong point — with aircraft door closing 10 minutes before departure time. Inflight announcements will address passengers as guests and there could be a special recorded message from group chairman emeritus Ratan Tata. A “enhanced meal service” will be rolled out on flights in a staggered manner from Thursday. The changes have started flowing in form of advisories to frontline staff who are interface with passengers. As reported by TOI on Tuesday, cabin crew BMI and grooming will be checked when they report for flights. This is being opposed by unions. “Tonight we will transit from a public sector to a private sector. The next seven days will be very important as we will be changing our image, attitude and perception,” says a mail sent to cabin crew members. The key points finalised by Sandeep Verma and Megha Singhania of Tatas, who will head inflight service, are that cabin crew are “important brand ambassadors playing critical role in brand/image building. Passengers will be welcomed, addressed and served as guests. “There will be changes in (inflight) announcements… will be intimated… Special audio address by Shri Ratan Tata,” it says. “Crew has to be smartly dressed, adhering to regulations. Grooming associates will be observe the crew for the above.” Air India domestic OTP is among the lowest for all big airlines and the founder group realises this needs to change. “On time performance is important. All endeavours to close doors at D (departure time) minus 10 minutes.” The meal service on board will be enhanced. “The caterers have been briefed. They will gradually provide the meals and equipments for the service.” Delhi-Mumbai and key Gulf routes will be among the first to get this rollout along with flights to the US and UK. Read AlsoAir India makeover begins: Airline to check cabin crew BMI & grooming when they report for flightsPreparing for a makeover as it heads back to founder Tata Group, Air India will now check the body mass index (BMI, basically a ratio of a peron’s weight and height), and overall grooming of its cabin crew members when they report for flights. The airline on January 20, 2022, informed cabin crew ofWhile big ticket changes like fleet and cabin upgrade will take time, two things have been identified for giving a new feel to passengers, nee guests, post the takeover — vastly improved meal service and airline interface with crew and ground staff. If Tatas are able to transform AI into a profitable airline — something that their recent airline ventures AirAsia India and Vistara have not been since inception in the last 7-8 years — it will be one of the biggest aviation transformations globally. Challenges — not just financial in terms of massive investment needed for fleet and cabin upgrade — abound for the Tatas. Two pilots unions have warned of legal action over their “multiple (salary) deductions” and have projected recoveries. “This recovery exercise is entirely illegal, and we demand that this anomaly is rectified and the amount due is repaid with immediate effect,” the letter sent by the two unions said. Cabin crew unions are up in arms against the move to check body mass index (BMI) and overall grooming of staffers when they report for flights. The Tatas have so far not spoken about their preparations to take over AI and AI Express and also their plans for the airline. That clarity is expected when the handover happens. It is leant the Tatas have so far not approached the regulator for a licence/s (airline operating permit) for their airline. The Aircraft Act empowers the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to allow the Tatas to operate the airlines in an interim period till they decide what form will their aviation vertical look like — one mega airline or the more likely option of a merged AirAsia India-Air India Express as a big low cost carrier (LCC) and Air India and Vistara continuing as separate full service carriers (FSC). The four Boeing 747 jumbo jets of AI are also being transferred to the Tatas. But since they are each over 27-year-old and no longer used for VVIP flights, it remains to be seen if the Tatas use them. The Rs 18,000-crore deal will see Tatas giving up Rs 2,700 crore upfront and taking over Rs 15,300 crore debt. Additionally they will spend several thousand crores on revamping the airline.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/the-new-air-india-what-changes-first-when-tatas-take-back-their-maharaja/articleshow/89142938.cms||Saurabh Sinha
---||India||Eminent personalities write to Karnataka CM over 'violence against minorities'||BENGALURU: Nearly three dozen eminent personalities have written a joint open letter to Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai expressing their concern over the "frequent violence against religious minorities" in the state. "We are a group of senior scientists, writers, academics, artists, and lawyers, and we write with concern about Karnataka's deteriorating governance and the frequent violence against religious minorities," read the letter. The letter stated, "Over the past few months, the state has witnessed the brutal killing of youths in several districts, rampant 'hate speeches', public threats and disruptions of worship by religious minorities, 'honour killings', 'moral policing', misogynistic statements by legislators, and incidents of hostile and violent encounters between various religious groups. These trends have been encouraged by the callous and un-constitutional statements made by Legislators and the inability of the state machinery to rein-in fringe anti-social groups." The letter further alleged that such trends go against the long history of Karnataka as a progressive state that facilitated social harmony of a plural society and initiated model welfare programs for all sections of the population. "The state's cultural history celebrates the plurality of cultures and religious tolerance and our icons have long been Basavanna, Akkamahadevi, Kanakadasa, Purandaradasa, and Shishunala Sharifa. Our litterateurs, ranging from Bendre to Kuvempu, have celebrated a Karnatakatva that is based on multi-cultural identities that blend together to make a harmonious and rich social fabric, " the letter said. It added, "We note with both sadness and alarm that these traditions of tolerance and shared well-being are being torn asunder. Instead, the state is losing its identity on multiple fronts. On the fiscal, administrative, and political fronts Karnataka is losing its federal strength." "We call upon you all to seriously review these negative trends in the state and to ensure that the rule of law, the principles of the Constitution, the rights of all citizens, and the basic norms of humaneness prevail. It will be your abilities to address these challenges that will be the yardstick with which posterity will assess you," the letter said. On this special day, as India marks its national status as a 'Republic' and as a state within this federal republic, the personalities expressed hope that the government will initiate a period of social harmony, just legislations, and democratic functioning of the state machinery. Eminent personalities include Professor Vinod Gaur, who was the former Secretary at the Department of Science and Technology; Major General SG Vombatkere, VSM, retired among others.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/eminent-personalities-write-to-karnataka-cm-over-violence-against-minorities/articleshow/89143078.cms||---

The Fed Reserve also reaffirmed plans to end its bond purchases in March before launching a significant reduction in its asset holdings, which will be a pivot away from the loose monetary policy that has defined the pandemic era and toward a more urgent fight against inflation.  "With inflation well above 2 per cent and a strong labor market, the Committee expects it will soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate," the US central bank's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee said in a policy statement. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell later at a press conference said he expects inflation to fall during 2022, blaming the pandemic for much of the increase in US prices in recent months. "We continue to expect it to decline over the course of the year," Powell said following the conclusion of the central bank's policy meeting. He noted that "the drivers of higher inflation have been predominantly located to the dislocations caused by the pandemic".  The Fed also said its FOMC members had agreed on a set of principles for "significantly reducing" the size of its asset holdings by limiting how much of the principal from maturing bonds it would reinvest each month. That plan would start after the liftoff in interest rates, the Fed said, without yet setting a specific date.  The Fed cited "solid" recent job gains even as the outbreak of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus pushed daily case numbers to record levels, and said it continued to expect improvements in global supply chains to improve inflation.  Other risks have arisen in the weeks since the Fed's Dec. 14-15 policy meeting, with Western nations fearing a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine and investors selling off stocks.  But that did not detract from the Fed's urgency to lean against inflation that has hit multi-decade highs.  "Supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have continued to contribute to elevated levels of inflation," the Fed said.  Policymakers did not release new economic and interest rate projections on Wednesday. In a news conference scheduled later for the day, Fed Chair Jerome Powell is expected to continue bringing the central bank into line with public and market expectations that it will move more aggressively to temper consumer price increases that have hit 7% annually - the highest level since the 1980s.

The ministry also set up a five-member high-level committee to look into the issues raised by the applicants many of whom have joined the demonstrations affecting rail operations. There were also reports of police action against protesters in UP, with sources indicating there are concerns and inputs that the protests may spread to other parts of the country. The committee has been set up with the mandate to receive the complaints and suggestions and to submit its recommendations by March 4.

A total of 1.25 crore people had applied and 7.05 lakh qualified in stage-1 test. Following new norms, which came into force in 2019, the railways shortlisted the candidates for the second test and their number was 20 times the total number of vacancies. Since candidates could apply for more than one category, many of them qualified for the second test in more than one category. The protesters have been raising questions primarily on the provision of the second test and allowing candidates to qualify for more than one category of jobs. Appealing to protesters not to “damage and destroy” public property, railway minister Ashwini Vaishanaw said, “You are the future. You should preserve your property. I request students not to take the law into their hands.” Responding to a question if the issue has become political, Vaishanaw said. “This isn’t a political issue.

Their bail applications have been rejected. The three students, all between 20-21 years, have been in Agra district jail since October 2021. Raising objections over the court’s decision, defence lawyer Madhuvan Dutt Chaturvedi said the court can’t take cognisance of the chargesheet without prior approval for prosecution from the central or state government. “This is outside the court’s jurisdiction,” he said. “Taking the state or central government’s approval is mandatory. The police investigation is incomplete despite taking 90-day custody of the students. ” Senior prosecuting officer Vinod Yadav said the chargesheet was filed by police within the allocated time of 90 days and the sanction from the state government has already been “applied for”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/court-takes-cognisance-of-chargesheet-against-3-kashmiri-students/articleshow/89143233.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

The embassy said in a statement that the call for registration was made with an intent to coordinate with Indian citizens effectively and disseminate information in a swift manner. The mission asked Indian nationals to share their details by January 31. “Embassy of India in Kyiv is closely monitoring the situation. It is advised to continue to follow the Embassy website, facebook and twitter pages for further updates, which would be published as and when required,” the embassy said. According to ministry of external affairs, there are about 18,000 Indian students in Ukraine, mainly in the field of medicine. There are also hundreds of Indian business professionals who work predominantly in pharmaceuticals, IT, engineering, medicine and education. The government has been closely following the situation while refraining, given India’s close ties with both US and Russia, from making any political comment on the developing situation. US deputy secretary of state Wendy Sherman had briefed foreign secretary Harsh Shringla last week about the situation in Ukraine and US efforts to prevent an invasion by Russian forces. The US on Tuesday warned Moscow that it will personally target President Vladimir Putin with sanctions if Russia went ahead with Ukraine invasion.

---||World||Paramedic says he wasn't told George Floyd wasn't breathing||ST PAUL: A paramedic, who treated George Floyd on the day he was killed in 2020, testified Wednesday at the federal trial of three former Minneapolis police officers that he wasn't told the Black man wasn't breathing and had no pulse when officers upgraded the urgency of an ambulance call. Derek Smith said that after he arrived on May 25, 2020, he could not find a pulse in Floyd's neck and that the Black man's pupils were large, indicating that "the patient was probably deceased". Former Officers J Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao are charged broadly with depriving Floyd of his civil rights while acting under government authority in the killing that triggered worldwide protests and a reexamination of racism and policing. Prosecutors say the three officers failed to act to save Floyd's life as fellow Officer Derek Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck for 9 1/2 minutes while he was handcuffed, facedown and gasping for air. Kueng knelt on Floyd's back, Lane held his legs and Thao kept bystanders back, according to prosecutors. On video footage from Lane's body camera played for jurors, Smith asks Lane what happened. Lane recounts the officers' response to a 911 call that Floyd tried to use a counterfeit $20 bill at a corner store and a struggle as Floyd kicked his way out of a squad car. He says officers were "just basically restraining him until you guys got here.'' Lane says nothing about Floyd's medical condition. Assistant US attorney Manda Sertich sought to show jurors that paramedics were not given important information, noting that Smith wasn't told that Floyd had been held for more than 9 minutes. She also got Smith to agree that CPR should have been started as soon as possible, something the officers were trained to do. Smith said paramedics put Floyd in the ambulance and took him to another location to be treated for many reasons, including because bystanders were using "elevated tones". In the ambulance, Lane did chest compressions and Smith used a cardiac monitor that showed there was no electrical pulse to Floyd's heart. Paramedics also treated him by creating an airway, inserting an IV, and trying to provide other lifesaving measures. Defence attorneys pushed back. Lane's attorney, Earl Gray, asked Smith whether Lane was helpful in attempting to revive Floyd, including squeezing an air bag to try to ventilate Floyd's lungs. ``In my opinion, he was helpful, yes. Thank you,'' Smith said. Robert Paule, an attorney for Thao, got Smith to say that he would have not taken Floyd to another location to work on him if it weren't for the bystanders. Under cross-examination by Paule, Smith also acknowledged that he he was concerned that Floyd might have been in a state of ``excited delirium'', an agitated condition in which someone is described as having extraordinary strength. Some medical examiners in recent decades have attributed in-custody deaths to excited delirium, often in cases where the person had become extremely agitated after taking drugs, having a mental health episode or other health problem. But there is no universally accepted definition of it and researchers have said it's not well understood. One 2020 study concluded it is mostly cited as a cause only when the person who died had been restrained. Later, Minneapolis Fire Department Capt. Jeremy Norton, who arrived after paramedics had moved Floyd, testified that his department would have started CPR on the scene, and that providing care as early as possible would have been the best chance to save Floyd. A 911 dispatcher testified Tuesday that she would have sent the Fire Department instead of an ambulance if she had known Floyd wasn't breathing because they could have gotten there faster. Kueng, who is Black; Lane, who is white; and Thao, who is Hmong American, all are charged for failing to provide Floyd with medical care, while Thao and Kueng face an additional count for failing to stop Chauvin who is white. Both counts allege the officers' actions resulted in Floyd's death. Chauvin was convicted of state murder and manslaughter charges last year and also pleaded guilty to a federal civil rights charge. Prosecutors have argued in pretrial filings that even bystanders could see that Floyd needed medical attention, and that the officers, who had basic medical training, did not help. U.S. District Judge Paul Magnuson has said the trial could last four weeks. Lane's attorney has said his client will testify, but it's not known if Thao or Kueng will. It's also not clear whether Chauvin will testify, though many experts who spoke to The Associated Press believe he won't. Lane, Kueng and Thao also face a separate state trial in June on charges they aided and abetted both murder and manslaughter.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/paramedic-says-he-wasnt-told-george-floyd-wasnt-breathing/articleshow/89143335.cms||---
---||India||Girls worst hit in access to education during pandemic: Parliament panel||NEW DELHI: As the surging third wave puts the focus back on the pandemic’s impact on children’s education, the findings of a parliamentary committee highlights how the Covid crisis has disproportionately affected girls, especially their education. The committee on women empowerment, in its report presented during the winter session of Parliament in December, called for urgent measures to prevent girls from poor families, impacted by closure of schools and lack of digital access, from dropping out of school. On a specific question about the effect of the pandemic on enrolment and retention of girls in schools, especially from among the socially and economically backward groups in schools, the education ministry submitted before the panel that “school closure in India affected 320 million children enrolled from pre-primary to tertiary levels of education. It has been estimated that of these, about 158 million are female students”. Times ViewThis is another worrying example of the socially disastrous fall-outs of the pandemic. Authorities must take suitable steps to ensure that girls aren’t forced to drop out. In the long term, it would gravely hurt the nation’s interestsThe submissions and recommendations are part of the report on ‘Empowerment of Women Through Education with Special Reference to Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao Scheme’. The committee has observed that in the post-pandemic scenario, the probability of more adolescent girls dropping out of school permanently to help with household tasks and childcare due to the economic hardships of their families is very high. The panel has recommended incentivising participation that can help more girls continue their schooling and learning with measures like targeted scholarships, conditional cash transfers, provision of bicycles, access to smartphones and hostel facilities. The 31-panel, led by BJP MP Heena Vijaykumar Gavit, observed that as per the ‘unified district information system for education (UDISE )’ data for 2018-19, the gross enrolment ratio of girls decreased from 96.72 in elementary classes to 76.93 in secondary classes and to 50.84 in higher secondary classes. It also pointed out that the dropout ratio of girls during 2019-20 was 15.1. “The committee understand that the enrolment and retention of girls in schools in rural areas is still a great challenge despite having a plethora of efforts under RTE, Samagra Siksha etc. Further, lack of digital access to learning, poor family background, closure of schools and hostels facilities for girls, the uncertainty of re-opening of schools pose serious challenges in girls’ retention in schools,” said the report. It suggested urgent and concerted efforts to mobilise the return of girls students to schools and sustain their regular attendance. The panel lauded the step by the Centre asking every state to map ‘out of school’ children through household surveys and preparing guidelines to reach out to the last girl child to resolve her problems.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/girls-worst-hit-in-access-to-education-during-pandemic-parliament-panel/articleshow/89143326.cms||Ambika Pandit

The driver and a passenger ran away, but the former was arrested after a brief foot chase, Sheriff Earnell Lucas said at a news conference. Sheriff's officials said the man, responsible for shooting the 26-year-old deputy, apparently killed himself. While searching the area, law enforcement officers encountered a man crouched behind a vehicle, gave him some commands, then heard a single gunshot and found the individual was dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. Sheriff's officials said a preliminary investigation suggests that the man was responsible for shooting the deputy. The deputy, who had been with the sheriff's department for just 18 months, received bullets in both arms and his torso, but the wounds were not believed to be life-threatening, Lucas said, adding he had responded as backup after another deputy made the stop.  No officers fired their weapons during the ordeal, he said.  Another person found walking in the neighborhood was arrested after a brief chase and deputies were trying to determine whether that person was involved in the shooting as well, Lucas said.  The shooting prompted an emergency alert to cell phones telling people to "shelter in place" and to call 911 if needed. The alert was lifted late Wednesday morning. Police from Milwaukee and West Allis were assisting in the search, the sheriff's office said on Twitter. Two area schools switched to online learning Wednesday because of the shooting and the investigation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/wisconsin-deputy-shot-at-suspect-kills-self/articleshow/89143392.cms||---
---||India||‘By April-May, Omicron may be in the past’||Mark Suzman, CEO and the newly-inducted board member of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, is hopeful that the Omicron threat is likely to recede by April-May for most countries, including India. In an interview withSurojit Gupta, Suzman says helping set up mRNA factories will be an important area of collaboration with India in the months ahead. Excerpts from the interview:When do you think the Covid-19 pandemic will end, or are we going to be in this for some time? We track the WHO’s work and briefing. If you look at some of the modellings done by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), they are predicting that, while we’re still in the midst of a sort of steep Omicron crisis, there is a fair likelihood that it will start to decline fairly steeply, and by around April or May it might be, or for most countries, including India, mostly in the rearview mirror. We need to keep monitoring for other variants. Why do you think the world and Covax have not been able to adequately address the issue of vaccine inequality? Over the last two years, and especially the last year, the inequity in global distribution of vaccines has remained a big challenge. Covax was not able to meet many of its original commitments, largely because supplies had been taken up by wealthier countries for their own citizens. And that led to significant delays and setbacks. That has now started to change significantly. Covax recently distributed its one-billionth dose. It is on track to keep expanding at a rapid pace... Vaccination rates in low-income countries are still far lower than they need to be. We’re hopeful that this is a year that that changes, and it does require continued support to Covax from countries, both in terms of financial support and donations of doses. Certainly, India’s role and Indian manufacturers’ role, particularly with the Covishield vaccines, will be a big key going forward to meeting those objectives. Last year, Bill Gates had told us in an interview that when the next pandemic comes, the effort will be to get large mRNA factories in India. Is there any progress on that? We’ve been investing for some years and looking at ways mRNA might be able to be used to address diseases like malaria, HIV, and tuberculosis, in addition to Covid and potential future pandemic threats. As part of that, India, as a long-time global leader in vaccine production, will absolutely have a critical part to play in mRNA production going forward. We’ve been engaged in some discussions providing technical support and connections to Indian counterparts. This is something that Bill Gates did discuss with the PM when they met at the COP26 in Glasgow at the end of last year, and we think that will be a very important area of collaboration going forward. What is the foundation’s assessment of how the Indian government has dealt with the pandemic in all the three waves? India’s response has been very strong. This pandemic has posed a unique challenge in every country because the world hasn’t faced something like this before. Just taking the example of the vaccine programme and where India is one year after launching it with over 1.6 billion doses, I think is a very impressive model for the rest of the world. As always, there are lessons, for some of the things around the oxygen provision in areas where we look and hope we can build on and prepare for future threats, but overall, a very strong response, and we’ve been proud and pleased to be able to help partner and work with our Indian counterparts.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/by-april-may-omicron-may-be-in-the-past/articleshow/89143395.cms||Surojit Gupta

The study, which is yet to be peer-reviewed and was released on bioRxiv preprint server on January 26, emphasised the need for an Omicron-specific vaccine strategy. The study was conducted on 39 individuals — 25 of whom had taken both doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, eight both doses of the Pfizer jab and six were unvaccinated. Also, 28 of the 39 were people who had returned from various countries like the UAE, US, and UK, and 11 were their high-risk contacts. All of them were infected with the Omicron variant. The main limitation of the study was the small sample of the unvaccinated group and the short window period post infection.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/omicron-infection-may-protect-against-delta-icmr/articleshow/89143447.cms||---

Deaths, however, crossed the 500 mark for the second day in a row. With data from Tripura yet to come at the time of filing this story, Wednesday’s case count stood at 286,994 cases and 501 deaths. The dip in cases is likely to be linked to the weekend effect and today being a public holiday when testing tends to reduce. Whether the third wave is still building up or is going a downward slope will become clearer in the coming days. Although the relative death counts as compared to cases have been significantly lower in the third wave when one compares it with the second wave, the steady increase in deaths is a worrying trend. At this level of cases, the deaths reported during the second wave were in the tune of around 2000 daily fatalities. It is, however, important to note that the deaths have a much slower rate of decline as compared to cases as the count in the second wave continues to remain above 500 even in August when the cases have dipped to less than 50,000 as compared to the peak level when around 4 lakh cases were being reported. Thirteen states reported double-digit death figures on Wednesday. The list is led by Maharashtra, where 79 people succumbed to the virus. Kerala was the second state to report more than 50 deaths as the state’s count stood at 63. Tamil Nadu reported 47 fatalities and was followed by Karnataka and West Bengal each reporting more than 30 deaths. The death count was more than 20 for Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Assam. There were ten fatalities reported from Odisha and Chhattisgarh. In cases, Kerala lead the list of states and was followed by Karnataka — both reporting over 40,000 cases. The count was over 35,000 for Maharashtra which saw an increase in cases while Tamil Nadu detected about 30,000 new infections on Wednesday. Four states — Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh — reported between 10,000 to 20,000 cases. The count was between 1,000 and 10,000 for the next sixteen states.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/daily-covid-19-cases-below-3-lakh-for-3rd-day-but-deaths-over-500-for-2nd-day/articleshow/89143483.cms||---

---||India||Covid-19: Third shots may not be given to all as experts sceptical||NEW DELHI: The government may soon revisit its policy on booster doses of Covid vaccines as its scientific experts are of the view that benefits of a third shot may not merit expansion of the coverage to other age groups, official sources said. However, "precaution doses" may continue to be administered to healthcare workers and those above 60 years with co-morbidities under the government’s national immunisation programme as per the existing policy, a senior official told TOI. “Rethinking has to be done for boosters. The policy… has to be thought through. Boosters have not helped the cases in any country that has administered the third dose. Besides, we will not blindly follow what other countries have done. We have to look at our local epidemiology and science, and our decisions have to be based on that assessment,” the official said. Read AlsoEach dose of Covishield, Covaxin likely to be capped at Rs 275 after getting regular market approvalNEW DELHI: The price of Covishield and Covaxin, the Covid vaccines which are expected to soon get regular market approval from India's drug regulator, is likely to be capped at Rs 275 per dose plus an additional service charge of Rs 150, official sources said. According to them, the NationalThe National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) for Covid-19 and the WHO had a high-level meeting on Tuesday where the issue of boosters was discussed in detail. According to the official, experts from the WHO and NTAGI members have assessed real-world data from countries where boosters shots have been given. Besides, local data is also being studied. Experts are also reviewing the infection patterns, behaviour of the virus, emerging variants and viral loads along with breakthrough and reinfections. The WHO is also likely to come up with guidance on booster doses soon. A total of 86.87 lakh "precaution doses" have been administered to health and frontline workers and those above 60 years with co-morbidities since January 10, when it was introduced in the country. According to the health ministry’s projection, nearly three crore health and frontline workers are estimated to be eligible to get the booster shots. Besides, 2.75 crore people in the 60-plus age group with co-morbidities are projected across the country. While some studies conducted outside the country have shown that boosters can offer greater protection against SARS-CoV2, there are also studies where preliminary findings show a decline in antibody levels just weeks after a third dose. “The need of the hour is to develop a vaccine that can prevent not only severe disease from the infection but also spreading of infection. So that we can avoid community transmission,” the official said. India has been rather slow in endorsing boosters. The government has maintained that any such decision will be governed by scientific evidence. The decision to introduce booster shots was taken in the wake of rising number of Omicron cases. Recently, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention expanded eligibility for boosters to adolescents. However, many experts say that booster shots may not be a sustainable long-term strategy. WHO experts have already warned that repeating booster doses of the original Covid vaccines is not a viable strategy against emerging variants.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/covid-19-third-shots-may-not-be-given-to-all-as-experts-sceptical/articleshow/89143518.cms||Sushmi Dey
---||---||Amit Shah woos west UP Jat leaders ahead of assembly elections||NEW DELHI: Anxious to assuage the sullenness of sections of the Jat community in Western UP, Union home minister Amit Shah on Wednesday wooed a group of community influencers by stressing similarity of “nationalist” outlook, recalling communal riots of 2013 and promising resolution of their grievances and consideration of demands. “We subscribe to same ideology. Ours is a nationalist party and has always striven to secure nation. You have the same outlook and have the maximum representation in the armed forces. Just like you, nation’s interests have always been the top-most priority with us,” Shah told representatives of the Jat community as the battle for Western UP reaches the final stretch. The meeting happened against the backdrop of party’s anxiety to mollify the Jat community whose support was one of the key factors in its sweep in three straight elections, beginning with 2014 Lok Sabha polls. The resentment of the influential peasant caste over the now-repealed farm laws and the move of SP chief Akhilesh Yadav, BJP’s principal challenger to cash in on that by tying up with the community outfit, Rashtriya Lok Dal, represents a vulnerability in BJP’s plan for a repeat performance. According to sources, Shah, who was instrumental in enlisting the support of the community in the three previous contests, took note of the resentment, but argued that these were matters to be sorted out within the family and there was no need to involve “outsiders”. Shah also criticised Jayant Chaudhary, head of RLD, essentially a Jat outfit, for aligning with Samajwadi Party, saying that in an SP-led dispensation, he will end up playing subordinate to Azam Khan, the SP leader and an influential minister in the Akhilesh government who many have blamed for the “biased” handling of the communal riots of 2013. “You have supported us wholeheartedly and you have every right to vent ire against us. My doors are always open for you. Come and sit with me and I assure you of my full support. However, you should not involve others and, instead, seek to sort out the issues among ourselves,” sources quoted the home minister telling the attendees at the in-camera meeting held at the residence of Outer Delhi MP, Pravesh Varma, son of former Delhi CM Sahib Singh Varma. Around 250 members of Jat community from different backgrounds, including politicians, traders, businessmen, farmers and community representatives, took part in the “panchayat baithak”, which was attended by education minister Dharmendra Pradhan, who is in-charge of UP campaign, important Jat MPs from Western UP, Sanjiv Balyan and Satyapal Singh and former Haryana minister Captain Abhimanyu Singh. The participants raised demands like a better scheme of sugarcane support price, community quota and appropriate recognition for former PM and community icon Chaudhary Charan Singh. Shah, who was introduced as "Chaudhary” — a community honorific — said that while BJP liked Jayant Chaudhary, fact remains he had made a “wrong call” by partnering Akhilesh Yadav. Shah gave an assurance to look into the “grievances” of the community and live by the promises the party has made to the community “as it had done in the past”. “Today is a special day as it was on 26th January when the country enacted its Constitution and I have come to meet you today. I had met you in 2013 and you helped BJP form the government at the Centre in 2014. Your support was instrumental in government formation in 2017 (UP) and 2019 (Centre) too. Whenever we sought the support of the Jat community, they extended their support to us wholeheartedly,” the home minister said in his brief address. Shah said that he had launched his pan-India political innings from Uttar Pradesh and was overwhelmed at the support extended by the Jat community. “Jat community always thinks about the growth of the state and prosperity of the farmers as does BJP. Besides, the OROP (One Rank One Pension) was enacted by BJP,” Shah said. Some of the community leaders carried their ‘Hukkas’ and smoked in the lawns of the 20 Windsor Palace, the bungalow of Parvesh Varma, while a few carried plough replicas and gifted them to Shah. The dais had a ‘Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan’ banner in the backdrop, while Shah donned a turban sharing space with the community figures.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/amit-shah-woos-west-up-jat-leaders-ahead-of-assembly-elections/articleshow/89143574.cms||Akhilesh Singh

The resentment of the influential peasant caste over the now-repealed farm laws and the move of SP chief Akhilesh Yadav, BJP’s principal challenger to cash in on that by tying up with the community outfit, Rashtriya Lok Dal, represents a vulnerability in BJP’s plan for a repeat performance. According to sources, Shah, who was instrumental in enlisting the support of the community in the three previous contests, took note of the resentment, but argued that these were matters to be sorted out within the family and there was no need to involve “outsiders”. Shah also criticised Jayant Chaudhary, head of RLD, essentially a Jat outfit, for aligning with Samajwadi Party, saying that in an SP-led dispensation, he will end up playing subordinate to Azam Khan, the SP leader and an influential minister in the Akhilesh government who many have blamed for the “biased” handling of the communal riots of 2013. “You have supported us wholeheartedly and you have every right to vent ire against us. My doors are always open for you. Come and sit with me and I assure you of my full support. However, you should not involve others and, instead, seek to sort out the issues among ourselves,” sources quoted the home minister telling the attendees at the in-camera meeting held at the residence of Outer Delhi MP, Pravesh Varma, son of former Delhi CM Sahib Singh Varma. Around 250 members of Jat community from different backgrounds, including politicians, traders, businessmen, farmers and community representatives, took part in the “panchayat baithak”, which was attended by education minister Dharmendra Pradhan, who is in-charge of UP campaign, important Jat MPs from Western UP, Sanjiv Balyan and Satyapal Singh and former Haryana minister Captain Abhimanyu Singh. The participants raised demands like a better scheme of sugarcane support price, community quota and appropriate recognition for former PM and community icon Chaudhary Charan Singh. Shah, who was introduced as "Chaudhary” — a community honorific — said that while BJP liked Jayant Chaudhary, fact remains he had made a “wrong call” by partnering Akhilesh Yadav. Shah gave an assurance to look into the “grievances” of the community and live by the promises the party has made to the community “as it had done in the past”. “Today is a special day as it was on 26th January when the country enacted its Constitution and I have come to meet you today. I had met you in 2013 and you helped BJP form the government at the Centre in 2014. Your support was instrumental in government formation in 2017 (UP) and 2019 (Centre) too. Whenever we sought the support of the Jat community, they extended their support to us wholeheartedly,” the home minister said in his brief address. Shah said that he had launched his pan-India political innings from Uttar Pradesh and was overwhelmed at the support extended by the Jat community. “Jat community always thinks about the growth of the state and prosperity of the farmers as does BJP. Besides, the OROP (One Rank One Pension) was enacted by BJP,” Shah said. Some of the community leaders carried their ‘Hukkas’ and smoked in the lawns of the 20 Windsor Palace, the bungalow of Parvesh Varma, while a few carried plough replicas and gifted them to Shah. The dais had a ‘Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan’ banner in the backdrop, while Shah donned a turban sharing space with the community figures.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/amit-shah-woos-west-up-jat-leaders-ahead-of-assembly-elections/articleshow/89143545.cms||Akhilesh Singh

As the controversy kicked off by Ramesh’s comment continued to roil the Congress party, many leaders came out in support of Azad even as they lashed out at Ramesh. Azad told TOI, “I have received thousands of congratulatory phone calls and messages from across the country. These awards are national awards, and not from any particular party. Let me make it clear that they were initiated by no less a person than the first Prime Minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru in 1954. Some people are unnecessarily giving a twist to these awards for reasons known to them.” While Azad himself spoke on the issue, there was already a massive build-up in his favour, especially with members of the dissident" G-23 backing him for the honour. A close supporter, Kapil Sibal, went on to say that Azad was being honoured by rivals while Congress wanted to dump him - an allusion to a refusal of Rajya Sabha berth to the former Leader of Opposition who retired last year. “Azad conferred Padam Bhushan. Congratulations bhaijan! Ironic that the Congress doesn’t need his services when the nation recognises his contributions to public life,” he tweeted. Support came also from outside the G-23 bloc. Former Union minister Ashwani Kumar said, “Congress Rajya Sabha whip’s (Ramesh) criticism of Azad for receiving the Padma award is nothing less than a shameful innuendo intended to rob both the award and its recipient of the deserved dignity. Such a mindset does not do justice to the dignitarian ethos of the Congress.” Ramesh had on Tuesday lauded former West Bengal CM and CPM veteran Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee’s decision to turn down the Padma honour with a caustic barb aimed at Azad. “Right thing to do. He wants to be Azad, not Ghulam,” he tweeted. While Ramesh’s jibe was seen as suggestive of the unease in Congress over Azad’s acceptance of the award from the Modi government, and conveyed an expectation that he will refuse it, the party itself remained silent on the issue. Other G-23 leaders like Anand Sharma, Bhupinder Hooda, Shashi Tharoor and Manish Tiwari welcomed the award in tweets.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/padma-to-ghulam-nabi-brings-congress-fissures-to-fore-again/articleshow/89143590.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal

In a first, spectators were able to get an aerial view of the flypast as the defence ministry put out stunning footage of the air show taken from cockpits of some of the aircraft. The IAF had coordinated with public broadcaster Doordarshan to show recorded in-flight videos. A magnificent bird’s eye visuals of different aircraft formations flying above the clouds were telecast and also shown on large screens installed at the parade venue. Vintage, as well as modern aircraft like Rafale, Sukhoi, Jaguar, Mi-17, Sarang, Apache and Dakota, displayed different formations, including Rahat, Meghna, Eklavya, Trishul, Tiranga, Vijay and Amrit, over the Central Vista. The country’s first woman fighter pilot Flight Lieutenant Shivangi Singh, who is flying the multirole Rafale fighter, was part of the IAF tableau this time. She is the second woman fighter pilot to be part of the IAF tableau. Last year, Flt Lt Bhawna Kanth became the first woman fighter pilot to be part of the parade. Shivangi, who joined the air force in 2017 and hailed from UP’s Varanasi, was flying MiG-21 Bison before being inducted into the IAF’s elite Golden Arrows squadron of Rafale aircraft. The IAF was the first force of the three wings to have allowed women officers in combat and has the highest percentage of women officers. The flypast began with the ‘Dhwaj’ formation with four Mi-17 aircraft, followed by ‘Rudra’ and ‘Rahat’ formations with four and five Advanced Light Helicopters (ALH), respectively. Next was the Tangail formation which saw one Dakota and two Dornier flying in Vic formation. This was a tribute to the Tangail airdrop operations of the 1971 Indo-Pakistan war. Tangail formation was followed by the Traan formation and Netra formation. Next was Vinaash formation comprising five Rafale aircraft followed by Baaz and Trishul formation. In a tweet, defence ministry principal spokesperson A Bharat Bhushan Babu said, “Cockpit view of Baaz formation comprising 1 Rafale, 2 Jaguar, 2 MiG-29 UPG, 2 Su-30 MI ac in seven ac ‘Arrowhead’ formation flying at 300m AOL.” In the Tiranga formation, five Sarang (ALH) flew in Ladder formation streaming Tricolour after Varuna formation. In the Amrit formation, 17 Jaguar aircraft made a figure of 75 to mark the 75th year of Independence or ‘Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav’.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-a-first-on-r-day-largest-ever-fleet-of-75-aircraft-dominates-skies-aerial-view-from-cockpit-shown-at-flypast/articleshow/89143691.cms||Surendra Singh

Interestingly, both the states are going to the polls next month. Turbans were the PM’s fixed choice, whether it was Independence Day or Republic Day. Last year, he sported a special turban from Jamnagar on Republic Day and on Independence Day, he wore a saffron headgear with red patterns and a long plume. Modi makes a statement by wearing a dress or accessories from different states on important occasions in order to showcase the rich cultural diversity of the country. It is to be recalled that while taking Covid vaccine last year, he wore a gamcha (cotton bath towel). Uttarakhand chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami thanked PM Modi for representing the state’s culture and tradition in front of the world. This time too, PM Modi kept with his practice of walking down the Rajpath and greeting spectators after the parade. Accompanied with his security details, the PM was seen waving at the crowd.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-ditches-turban-dons-uttarakhand-cap-manipur-stole/articleshow/89143714.cms||Surendra Singh

The meeting, which couldn’t be held in-person because of the pandemic, will see participation by the leaders of all five Central Asian countries — Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. These leaders had also participated in a similar summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping on January 25. Three of the five Central Asian countries — Turkmenistan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan — also share border with Afghanistan. Top security officials from all five countries had participated last year in the Afghanistan conference hosted by NSA Ajit Doval. Afghanistan has been a major focus area for India in ties with both Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. India has also been looking to enhance cooperation with Tajikistan in areas like defence, border management and border infrastructure development. Uzbekistan agrees with India that the future of Afghanistan must be decided by the Afghan people themselves and that the legitimacy of any Afghan government was important before any effort to facilitate for its international recognition. The NSA conference saw an endorsement by all of the idea that Afghanistan’s neighbours needed to ensure unhindered access of humanitarian assistance to the people of Afghanistan. Official sources said apart from trade and connectivity, focus will also be on improving development partnerships and cultural and people-to-people contacts. According to the MEA, the summit is a reflection of India’s growing engagement with the Central Asian countries, which are a part of India’s “extended neighbourhood”. It recalled in a statement earlier that Modi paid “historic visit” to all Central Asian countries in 2015 and, subsequently, there have been high-level exchanges at bilateral and multilateral fora.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/focus-on-afghanistan-connectivity-and-infrastructure-at-todays-central-asian-meet/articleshow/89143740.cms||---

For many years now, the chopper has been the star campaigner in the state. This time around though, with the Covid third wave, that isn’t the case. With the election commission’s ban on polls rallies till January-end, the 20-odd helicopters of about 10 charter operators booked by political parties over two months ago have largely been left grounded, say charter operators. “There is a certain amount of disappointment among helicopter charter operators,” said Capt Uday Gelli, western region president of the Rotary Wing Society of India. The disappointment is acute since it's polls in UP, the state where the chopper is a bigger star than in any other state, that has been hit. “UP has a voracious appetite for helicopters. The beauty of UP elections is that they use helicopters even to travel small distances of 20 to 30km. The helicopter itself is a campaigner and it pulls more crowd than local leaders. About 80% of the crowd mills around the helipad than the podium,” said Mandar Bharde of charter company MAB Aviation Pvt Ltd. Parties ensure the choppers play to the gallery. “They ask pilots to do two-three rounds of low-flying over a village. A candidate landing in a helicopter exudes a certain power and pelf, which voters in those parts of the country find agreeable in a leader. For the past three assembly elections, helicopter use began 60 days before D-Day,” Bharde said, adding that national parties block about 6-7 helicopters each. Even the small parties engage helicopters. The current top gun is the AgustaWestland-139, the multi-engine chopper that can carry 14-16 passengers, but in `VVIP configuration’ it carries only about six passengers. Let out at Rs 4.5 lakh per hour, with a minimum 100-hour booking for two months, it fetches the operator about Rs 4 to 5 crore per election, he said. Then there are the single-engines, such as the Bell 407 and A-130 which go for Rs 1.3 lakh per hour. Rahul Jain of Universal Airways, a charter operator, said: “UP is a large state. As the election phases get going, the helicopter base moves from Lucknow to Varanasi. Helicopters are an essential arsenal in fighting polls. Leaders work inside helicopters, do TV interviews. But this time around, helicopter flying has been subdued.” Last year, the helicopter charter industry had managed a narrow escape from the clutches of the Covid second wave. There were no restrictions and assembly polls and campaigns had almost wrapped up by the time the second wave began peaking in the second half of April.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/covid-restrictions-hit-star-campaigner-helicopter/articleshow/89143900.cms||Manju V

---||India||RPN switch signals elbowing out of Congress in UP poll fight?||NEW DELHI: The crossover of Congress office-bearer RPN Singh to BJP has marked the defection of another high-profile leader once known for his proximity to Rahul Gandhi, deepening the perception that Congress is getting squeezed out between the principal political players in election-bound Uttar Pradesh. Singh, who was Union minister during the UPA regime and enjoyed the billing as part of Rahul’s ‘young team’, follows the road earlier taken by Jyotiraditya Scindia and Jitin Prasada that dealt a big shock to the beleaguered Congress. While Scindia managed to play a part in toppling the hard-earned Congress government in Madhya Pradesh, and is now a Union minister, Prasada was fighting serious marginalization after repeated defeats and managed to become a minister in the UP government and has since been positioned as a Brahmin face of BJP. RPN, facing similar political slide personally, is now looking for a resurrection. While Congress insiders point to the trio’s personal debacles to highlight that they were contributing little to the party’s muscle, the fact remains that such exits bolster the impression that young leaders do not see much hope in the party facing an existential crisis. Singh has a pocket of personal influence in the Kushinagar area and was among the few pedigreed leaders who won elections before the post-2014 Congress decimation. For a Congress without much strength on the ground, it only results in further weakening on the electoral front. Two days before Singh, former Bareilly MP Pravin Aron along with his wife who was announced the Congress candidate for the assembly polls, joined SP. Few others like Imran Masood of Saharanpur and some MLAs and former MLAs in UP have already defected to BJP or SP recently. The general message is that in the assembly polls being viewed as a direct clash between BJP and SP, Congress does not inspire much optimism among its own leaders on the ground despite the stewardship of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, which is a big vote of no confidence within the party.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rpn-switch-signals-elbowing-out-of-congress-in-up-poll-fight/articleshow/89143906.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal
---||World||Biden eyes at least 3 women judges for SC pick to fulfill campaign pledge||WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden is eyeing at least three judges as potential Supreme Court nominees who would fulfill his campaign pledge to nominate the first Black woman to the nation's highest court, according to aides and allies.  With Justice Stephen Breyer planning to retire, early discussions about a successor are focusing on U.S. Circuit Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, U.S. District Judge J. Michelle Childs and California Supreme Court Justice Leondra Kruger, according to four people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss White House deliberations. Jackson and Krueger have long been seen as possible nominees.  Since Biden took office in January 2021, he has installed five Black women on federal appeals courts, with three more nominations pending before the senate. Another Supreme Court candidate could come from among that group, Biden aides and allies said. Almost all of the recent Supreme Court nominees have been federal appeals judges.  By the end of his first, Biden had won confirmation of 40 judges, the most since president Ronald Reagan. Of those, 80% are women and 53% are people of color, according to the White House.  Jackson, 51, was nominated by president Barack Obama to be a district court judge. Biden elevated her to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Early in her career, she was also a law clerk for Breyer.  Childs, a federal judge in South Carolina, has been nominated but not yet confirmed to serve on the same circuit court. She is a favorite among some high-profile lawmakers, including Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., and has received Republican support.  Kruger, a graduate of Harvard and Yale's law school, was a Supreme Court clerk and has argued a dozen cases before the justices as a lawyer for the federal government.  Breyer, 83, will retire at the end of the summer, according to two sources who confirmed the news to The Associated Press on Wednesday. They spoke on condition of anonymity so as not to preempt Breyer's formal announcement.  "Every justice should have an opportunity to decide what he or she is going to do and announce it on their own," Biden said. "There has been no announcement from Justice Breyer. Let him make whatever statement he's going to make and I'll be happy to talk about it later."  The Senate can confirm a successor before there is a formal vacancy.  When Biden was running for the White House, he said that if he had the chance to nominate someone to the court, he would make history by choosing a Black woman.  "As president, I'd be honored, honored to appoint the first African American woman. Because it should look like the country. It's long past time," Biden said in February 2020 shortly before South Carolina's presidential primary.  The White House has reiterated Biden's campaign pledge since his election.  Adding a Black woman to the court would mean a series of firsts - four female justices and two Black justices serving at the same time on the nine-member court. Justice Clarence Thomas is the court's only Black justice and just the second ever, after Thurgood Marshall.  Biden now has the chance to show Black voters increasingly frustrated with a president they helped to elect that he is serious about their concerns, particularly after he has been unable to push through voting rights legislation.  At the same time, Breyer's replacement by another liberal justice would not change the ideological makeup of the court. Conservatives outnumber liberals by 6-3, and Donald Trump's three nominees made an already conservative court even more conservative.  With the larger push to diversify the judiciary - Trump largely appointed white men during his time in office - Biden's team has consulted with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, Black caucus members, Clyburn, and influential Democratic lawyers.  Even with a narrowed field and the court's majority not to be altered, there's no guarantee a nominee will sail through the Senate.  Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Wednesday that Biden's nominee "will receive a prompt hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee and will be considered and confirmed by the full United States Senate with all deliberate speed".  But Republicans, in particular, remain upset about Justice Brett Kavanaugh's contentious 2018 hearing. Still, Democrats have the 50 votes plus a tiebreaker in Vice President Kamala Harris that they need to confirm a nominee.  White House press secretary Jen Psaki dismissed speculation that Biden might nominate Harris and said the administration would not comment until Breyer made his retirement official. She said Biden has been clear he plans to run for reelection in 2024 with Harris on the ticket.  Republicans who changed the Senate rules during the Trump-era to allow simple majority confirmation of Supreme Court nominees appeared resigned to the outcome. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee said in a statement: "If all Democrats hang together - which I expect they will - they have the power to replace Justice Breyer in 2022 without one Republican vote in support."  Nonetheless, Democrats have also been unable to get all its members on board for Biden's social and environmental spending agenda or to move forward with a voting rights bill.  Biden is uniquely aware of the challenges that come with a confirmation. As a senator, he served as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, overseeing six Supreme Court confirmation hearings from 1987 to 1995, including Breyer's.  And one person who will be central to Biden's process is chief of staff Ron Klain, a former Supreme Court law clerk and chief counsel on the Senate Judiciary Committee. While serving as an associate White House counsel for President Bill Clinton in 1993, Klain was summoned to breakfast with Justice Byron White, for whom he had clerked, only to be surprised with a resignation letter for Clinton.  Two other Black women Biden appointed to federal appeals courts are also seen as contenders: Holly Thomas, a longtime civil rights lawyer he named to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit and Candace Jackson-Akiwumi, a former public defender he named to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit.  Biden could also choose someone from outside the judiciary, though that seems less likely. One contender would be the head of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Sherrilyn Ifill, 59. She has headed the fund since 2013 and has announced she is stepping down in the spring.  The court has had three women on it for more than a decade, since 2010, when Obama named Justice Elena Kagan to the court to replace the retiring John Paul Stevens. Kagan joined Obama's other nominee, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the court's first Latina justice, and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. When Ginsburg died in September 2020, Trump announced his choice of Amy Coney Barrett eight days later.  Barrett was confirmed exactly a month after that. Democrats sharply criticized that timeline then, arguing that most confirmations had taken much longer and that Republicans were trying to jam the nomination through in case Trump lost reelection. But now that they hold the presidency and the Senate, though just barely, Democrats navigating the complicated politics of a 50-50 chamber are eyeing a similarly swift schedule, even if Breyer does not officially step down until the summer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biden-eyes-at-least-3-women-judges-for-sc-pick-to-fulfill-campaign-pledge/articleshow/89143920.cms||---
---||India||Under govt pressure, Twitter limiting my followers: Rahul Gandhi||NEW DELHI: Congress member Rahul Gandhi has written to Twitter that the microblogging platform is limiting his ability to find new followers under pressure from the government of India, citing that his following has virtually frozen ever since his account was briefly locked in August 2021. Rahul wrote to Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal on December 27, alleging that the platform was probably working under pressure from the Modi government. As per the details provided to Twitter, the Congress MP pointed out that he was gaining new followers at the rate of over 2.3 lakh per month, which even went up to 6.5 lakh on certain months. However, since August 2021, his new follower account had come down to roughly 2,500 per month and his total following of 19.5 million has remained virtually frozen during this period. Rahul’s Twitter account ran into a controversy in August 2021 when he tweeted a picture of the family of a rape victim in Delhi. Following complaints from BJP members, Twitter held that Rahul had violated laws by posting that picture and his account was locked for around eight days. While the account was unfrozen later, Congress said it has since witnessed serious obstacles in the form of its ability to increase influence on the platform that has become a key instrument in public communication and political campaign. “You have an enormous responsibility to ensure that Twitter does not actively help in the growth of authoritarianism in India,” Rahul wrote to Agrawal. He alleged that there is a complete state capture of traditional media, and social media has become more important in raising peoples issues and holding the government to account. “The ideological battle between liberal democracy and authoritarianism across the world is being shaped on social media platforms. This places a huge responsibility on those that are at the helm of companies like Twitter,” he wrote.

---||India||Rains sow hope for bumper Rabi crop||NEW DELHI: Backed by rains this month which helped ongoing sowing operation and served the standing crops well in most states, the overall acreage of rabi (winter sown) crops is all set to create a new record in what may eventually lead to bumper output of foodgrains for a second successive pandemic-hit year. Though the acreage of wheat this season continues to be marginally less than its sown area in the corresponding period last year, the higher acreage of oilseeds and pulses may help in setting the new record. Acreage data of agriculture ministry as on last Friday showed the total sown area under rabi crop at 680 lakh hectares compared to 672 lakh hectares during corresponding period last year — an increase of over 1%. It, however, reported an increase of nearly 9% compared to normal sown area (625 lakh hectares) of rabi crops during corresponding period. The normal sown area is calculated as an average of last five years’ acreage. The high acreage this year indicates the possibility of higher output of foodgrains in the 2021-22 crop year compared to previous year’s production. Although the acreage of wheat was around 4 lakh hectares less as on last Friday, pulses’ sown areas showed an increase of over 1 lakh hectares and acreage of oilseeds showed an increase of over 18 lakh hectares (23%) compared to its sown areas during corresponding period in 2019-20. “Substantial increase in acreage of oilseeds is attributed to farmers’ choice in its favour which is influenced by higher hike in MSP of mustard and rapeseed. Higher sown area along with favourable weather conditions including a wet spell at appropriate time will help farmers in getting higher output in 2021-22,” said an official in agriculture ministry. The ministry has already estimated higher production of kharif (summer sown) crops, including record output of paddy in 2021-22, indicating how this along with high rabi crops’ output will make the current year more productive than the previous one. Total production of kharif crops in India is estimated at record 150 million tonnes (MT) which is over 12 MT higher than the average production of previous five years (2015-16 to 2019-20). As far as paddy is concerned, its output during 2021-22 is estimated at 107 MT which is over 9 MT higher than its average output of the past five years.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rains-sow-hope-for-bumper-rabi-crop/articleshow/89143958.cms||Vishwa Mohan

Keen to save native languages and dialects, the government, while finalising the Padma Shri list, included Karbi author and poet Dhaneswar Engti who has penned 19 books and 100 songs in Karbi; Pahari litterateur Vidyanand Sarek who had been writing and translating in Simauri, a language on the verge of extinction; author T Senka who is preserving Nagaland’s endangered Ao language; Koshali author Narasingha Orasad Guru who has developed a dictionary of Koshali, an Odia dialect; and Santhali author from Jhargram Kali Pada Saren. The proponents of rare art forms who have received recognition this year include mardal player from Kalimpong Kaajee Singh who has worked tirelessly to promote and preserve Gorkha folk music; Arjun Singh Dhumre who has been performing the dying Baiga tribal dance for four decades; folk artist Ram Sahay Panday who has popularised the Rai dance of the extinct Besiya tribe by mixing it with mridangam beats; Gamaka singer from Shivamogga H R Keshavamurthy who has dedicated six decades of his life to preserving and promoting Kavya Vachana, a rare Kannada form of story-telling; 1971 war veteran Sheesh Ram who paints tales of valour; last exponent of kinnera, an ancient musical instrument, Darshanam Mogilaiah; Ramachandraiah who is amongst the last artists preserving the ancient Koya practice of reciting oral histories; last surviving ‘devadasi’ of her cohort and seventh generation Sadir dancer R Muthukannammal; and Ladakhi wood carver Tsering Namgyal. A 75-year paediatrician Lata Desai who quit her job in US to provide healthcare in Gujarat and orthopaedic surgeon Sunkara Venkata Adinarayana Rao were named for Padma Shri. ‘Yog sewak’ Sivananda, a Padma Shri awardee, is a 125-year-old living embodiment of yoga, dhyan and sewa. Another interesting entry in is that of IIT Delhi Professor Emeritus Dilip Shahani who contributed towards designing and development of EVM and VVPAT technology platforms.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/padma-honours-native-language-crusaders/articleshow/89143989.cms||---

SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal said Bikram, who is his brother-in-law, would defend his citadel Majithia in addition to accepting the challenge of breaking Sidhu’s “arrogance”. He said Badal senior, his father, agreeing to contest the election was also a boost for the party. “The entire party had pleaded with Sardar Parkash Singh Badal not to retire from politics, and he acceded to our request. Badal Sahab has always been at the forefront of service for the welfare of Punjab and Punjabis. He is doing so again,” Sukhbir said. Putting up a stout defence of Bikram, whose plea for anticipatory bail was rejected by the Punjab and Haryana high court on Monday, the SAD chief said the former had been falsely implicated in the narcotics case to prevent him from contesting the assembly polls. “Sidhu’s arrogance will be his undoing. He has been harping on mass support, which will now be tested by our ‘Majha da sher’ taking him on in his home constituency. He should get ready to fight the brave SAD workers. We will ensure he loses his security deposit. We know he has not done anything in his constituency for the last five years,” Sukhbir said. SAD fielded Satinder Singh Chajjwalwadi, son of three-time legislator Ranjit Singh Chajjalwadi, in the Baba Bakala seat.

"Prince Andrew hereby demands a trial by jury on all causes of action asserted in the complaint," his attorney wrote in a motion.  His accuser has said she had sex with the prince when she was 17 and a minor under US law after meeting him through the late US financier and convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.  The prince has not been criminally charged and has denied the allegations, which have left him in disgrace and forced him to withdraw from royal duties.  Earlier this month, Andrew was stripped of his honorary military titles and charitable roles after Judge Lewish Kaplan denied his plea to dismiss the case.  The 38-year-old victim alleges that Andrew sexually assaulted her at the London home of socialite and Epstein's friend Ghislaine Maxwell in March 2001.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/prince-andrew-seeks-jury-trial-in-new-york-in-sexual-assault-case/articleshow/89144040.cms||---

They requested the CM to rein in fringe elements and uphold the long history of Karnataka as a progressive state that facilitated social harmony with a plural society. Reacting to the letter, Bommai said all minorities in the state are safe and their constitutional rights are protected. “If there are excesses, immediate action has been taken by the government.” The letter was signed by 34 intellectuals from the state, including Ramachandra Guha, Janaki Nair, Sharadchandra Lele, Vinod Gaur and Vidyanand Nanjundiahamong others.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/eminent-people-write-to-bommai-on-hate-crime/articleshow/89144042.cms||---

It is the need of the hour, especially if we are to install 450 GW of renewable capacity by 2030. This means we need to double our annual installation from around 16 GW currently to 30-40 GW,” said Sumant Sinha, chairman and CEO, ReNew Power, while pitching for aggressive promotion of battery storage and the green hydrogen initiative. Modi had at COP26 in November last year committed to India reaching its non-fossil fuel energy capacity to 500 GW by 2030 and said 50% of the country’s electricity requirements will be from renewable energy. Besides, the PM also announced that the country would reduce emissions intensity of GDP by 45% by 2030 (from 2005 levels) and achieve ‘net zero’ emissions by 2070. “Reduction in duties on storage batteries can bring their capital cost down by almost 30% and help the storage industry find its feet before manufacturing under the PLI scheme kicks in a few years later. Similarly for green hydrogen, a promotional framework in initial years via a mandate for users, viability gap funding, cess on gray hydrogen (similar to coal cess), and a reduction in taxes and duties for equipment, will help in cutting down emissions in hard-to-abate industries like fertilisers, steel, heavy transport, and chemicals,” Sinha suggested. Industry bodies such as CII are also seeking policies to promote circular economy principles, with incentives to manufacturers and consumers, to produce and buy products with recycled content. Similarly, benefits for business models that promote product lifetime extension through re-design, re-furbishing and re-manufacturing, have also been suggested. In addition, a joint initiative with the private sector as part of the afforestation initiative for India to develop a carbon sink of 2.5-3 billion tonnes and restore 26 million hectares of land by 2030 has also been proposed. Besides, detailed discussions have been held on green mobility, where several steps have already been announced in recent month. Based on a Mckinsey report, industry bodies have identified several issues, with charging stations being a key focus area — from identifying land to issues with power distribution companies, preferential parking and those related to tax.

Indian IT services firms have outpaced their peers in the US, growing their brand value significantly over the past year, showed a brand valuation report from Brand Finance. The average growth of Indian brands since 2020 is an impressive 51%, while the US brands have on average contracted by 7%. Accenture has retained the top spot as the most valuable brand for the fourth consecutive year with its brand value increasing by 39% to $36.2 billion over the last year, the report said. TCS pipped IBM to take the second spot, with the brand valued at $16.8 billion, up 12% year-on-year and 24% since 2020. This growth was driven by the investments it made in its employees, customer equity and strong financial performance, the report said. IBM dropped to No. 4 in the 2022, with a brand value at $10.6 billion. Infosys moved to the third spot in the 2022 rankings from No. 5 last year, showing the fastest increase in brand value. There was a 52% growth in value in the past year to $12.8 billion. Over two years, the gain is as much as 80%. Following TCS and Infosys, four more Indian brands are among the global elite — Wipro at No. 7, HCL at No. 8, Tech Mahindra at No. 15, and LTI at No. 22.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tcs-no-2-in-global-it-services-brand-value-report/articleshow/89144207.cms||---

They urged the CM to rein in fringe elements and uphold the long history of Karnataka as a progressive state that facilitated social harmony with a plural society. The letter was signed by 34 intellectuals from the state including historians Ramachandra Guha, Prof. Janaki Nair, scientists Prof Sharadchandra Lele, Prof Vinod Gaur and Prof Vidyanand Nanjundiah, sociologists A R Vasavi and Prof Satish Deshpande, Kannada writers Vivek Shanbhag, Purushottam Bilimale and K P Suresha, environmentalist A N Yellappa Reddy and activist Bezwada Wilson. "We are a group of senior scientists, writers, academics, artists, and lawyers, and we write with concern about Karnataka's deteriorating governance and the frequent violence against religious minorities," the letter read. The letter lamented that over the past few months, the state has witnessed the brutal killing of youths in several districts, rampant ‘hate speeches', public threats and disruption of worship by religious minorities, ‘honour killings', ‘moral policing', misogynistic statements by legislators, and incidents of hostile and violent encounters between various religious groups. These trends have been encouraged by the unconstitutional statements made by legislators and the inability of the state machinery to rein-in fringe anti-social groups. The letter also alleged that such trends go against the long history of Karnataka as a progressive state. "The state's cultural history celebrates the plurality of cultures and religious tolerance and our icons have long been Basavanna, Akkamahadevi, Kanakadasa, Purandaradasa, and Santa Shishunala Sharifa," the letter said. "We note with sadness and alarm that these traditions of tolerance and shared well-being are being torn asunder. Instead, the state is losing its identity on multiple fronts. On the fiscal, administrative, and political fronts Karnataka is losing its federal strength. Recent legislations such as the ‘cow protection' and ‘anti-conversion' acts are pogroms against the economic and cultural rights of religious minorities. No longer are harmony, peace, and tolerance the hallmarks of the state, the signatories said. The letter also cautioned the CM that if the above issues are not addressed, Karnataka's reputation as a business or investors' destination will take a beating. The intellectuals urged the CM and all legislators to seriously review these negative trends and to ensure that principles of the Constitution, the rights of all citizens, and the basic norms of humaneness prevail. Minorities are safe: CMReacting to the letter Bommai said all minorities in the state are safe and their rights as citizens enshrined in the Constitution are being protected. "If there are excesses, immediate action has been taken by the government. In fact, we are coming out with a lot of programmes to improve the livelihood of minorities. I firmly believe in the three Es — education, employment and empowerment —and my government is at it," he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/34-intellectuals-write-to-cm-against-hate-crime/articleshow/89144239.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||Gurugram: Who to name on plaques? Councillors divided||GURUGRAM: An inauguration plaque in Sector 14 unveiled during the foundation stone laying ceremony of a new playground on January 23 has kicked off a debate among councillors about whose names should get displayed on such installations. The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has already set a format, stating that the plaques should have the names of the city MP, the urban local bodies minister, the MLA, the mayor and then the councillor. However, the plaque at the Sector 14 playground mentions the names of the MLA and councillor only. Some councillors claimed that the MCG made its format to please the higher officials and they should instead decide who to name on the plaques, but others agreed with the civic body rule. Anoop Singh, the councillor of ward number 6 under which the playground falls, said, “For the big projects, which require huge amounts of funding, we get the financial support and the administrative approvals with the help of the elected representatives. So, the plaques should have their names,” but he added that he could not make the playground plaque as per the MCG format due to time constraints. Expressing a different viewpoint, Hemant Kumar, the councillor of ward number 28, said, “What is the point of naming the elected representatives who do not know anything about the development projects in the wards? Only the councillor and the mayor are involved in the ward-level projects. So, the plaques should display their names.” Many said that councillors have to chase the files related to the development works in their wards as those go through the hands of the MCG engineers, the mayor and then the finance and contracts committee. Councillor Ravinder Yadav of ward number 3 said, “To get the approvals for the development works in my ward, I have to chase the officials concerned for months. The other councillors follow the same procedure. We do not get help for each project from the other elected representatives. So, instead of the authority, the councillors should decide the names on the plaques.” He added that for the small-scale projects of Rs 10-20 lakhs involving the building of toilets or cremation grounds, it is not appropriate to display all the names that the MCG wants to see. MCG commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja did not respond to calls despite repeated attempts. Mayor Madhu Azad said that the MCG set a pro forma for the naming since the councillors could not agree on whose names should appear on the plaques. “Since the councillors could not reach an agreement, the MCG commissioner set a proforma, with the plaques requiring the names of the MP, the ULB minister, the MLA, the mayor and the councillor. However, in many cases, the mayoral name had been found missing from the plaques.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/who-to-name-on-plaques-councillors-divided/articleshow/89144241.cms||Vishakha Chaman

According to officials, several GMDA projects have not been completed in sectors 58 to 115 due to hindrances in acquisition of land, encroachments, compensation issues and stays granted by various courts, which lead to ‘missing links’. “For example, if you acquire some land for a project like construction of a road but one patch has a stay order imposed by the high court, it becomes a missing link where you cannot undertake any work. You can carry out work around it, but you can’t do anything on that one patch,” said a senior GMDA official. Among the projects affected by such hindrances, officials said, was the Sector 72 boosting station, work on which has been complicated because of missing pipelines in some unacquired areas. Similarly, the project to channel sewage to the sewage treatment plant at Dhanwapur has been held up by incomplete sewerage in some areas. At the Authority meeting of the GMDA earlier this month also, chief executive officer (CEO) Sudhir Rajpal had said there are currently 221 points of hindrances in various projects that have been identified, of which 48 have been cleared through meetings with various stakeholders, while 173 are still pending. The issue had similarly come up for discussion during a meeting of the core planning cell earlier this week, where the CEO had directed that action be expedited towards this end.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/infra-in-new-sectors-gmda-to-ramp-up-steps-to-clear-hurdles/articleshow/89144242.cms||Sakshi Dayal
---||Gurgaon||Gurugram: Active Covid cases witness a sharp drop, but not hospitalisations||GURUGRAM: The number of new infections being reported daily has slowed down over the past week and active cases fell to just under 11,000 on Wednesday from over 25,000 nearly a week ago, but hospitalisation numbers still show a rise, even if a slight one. On January 21, when the city had 25,306 active cases — the highest in the current wave so far —175 Covid patients were admitted in various hospitals. On Wednesday, the number of patients being treated for Covid at various hospitals was 179, though active cases had fallen by more than 50% since January 21 to 10,797. The number of patients in hospitals during this wave has overall remained low. “The average hospitalisation rate for Covid in this surge has been less than 1%. We may see a rise in the cumulative number of hospitalisations, but daily hospitalisations have come down since the city is witnessing more recoveries than new cases. Besides, people with comorbidities should be more careful, as 98% of hospitalised patients have underlying diseases,” said Virender Yadav, the chief medical officer. The city has 2,712 ICU and oxygen beds reserved for Covid patients. Only 112 (4.1%) are occupied at present, according to the health department. This data, however, does not include Covid patients from other districts and states. If they are added to the tally, the city has 303 Covid patients in hospitals. As of now, 54 of these patients are from Delhi, 27 from Uttar Pradesh, 18 from other states and 28 from other districts of Haryana. Doctors said a lag between hospitalisation numbers and the surge in cases is explained by some patients developing complications in the later stages of the infection. Dr Shuchin Bajaj, founder-director of Ujala Cygnus Group of Hospitals, said: “Usually in the first five to seven days, patients are mildly symptomatic. Complications arise around the seventh to 10th day of their illness, where they face breathlessness, oxygen saturation falls and pneumonia takes hold. So, hospitalisations are expected to rise when the cases have peaked. Hospitalisations will peak around a week later, after which they will gradually start to decrease.” Dr Vikas Deswal, consultant (internal medicine) at Medanta, said, “We have seen an increase in hospitalisations over the last few days, even though cases are going down. The elderly, obese and those with comorbidities are primarily suffering from a severe form of Covid and form the bulk of hospital admissions.” While more patients are being admitted to hospitals, doctors haven't come across too many cases of severe lung infection, as a result of which the number of patients in ICUs and ventilator beds is low compared to the last two waves. “Almost all admitted patients have comorbidities or are senior citizens. This population is highly vulnerable to Covid. But thankfully, we have been able to handle these cases in a much better way compared to earlier waves, probably due to vaccination. Though the virus is affecting their lungs, they are responding well to treatment,” said Dr Amitabha Ghosh, consultant (internal medicine) at Manipal Hospital.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/active-cases-witness-a-sharp-drop-but-not-hospitalisations/articleshow/89144243.cms||Ipsita Pati

On the other hand, the positivity rate remained 23.3%, the same as the previous day. The city also reported one more Covid death on Wednesday. A 49-year-old man, hospitalised on January 4 with generalised weakness, decreased appetite and abdominal pain, died after a cardiac arrest on Wednesday. The fully vaccinated man, who suffered from diabetes mellitus, hypertension and stage 4 colon cancer, had been treated with IV fluids, antibiotics and other supportive measures. The doctors had also put him on a mechanical ventilator and inotropic support, given his shortness of breath. In the past 17 days, the city has reported 21 Covid deaths—one on January 10, another on January 12, two on January 14, one each on January 15 and 16, and two each on January 17, 19, 20, three on January 21, two on January 22, one on January 23, two on January 24 and one on January 26.  Gurugram has reported 948 Covid deaths since the start of the pandemic. In these cases, 630 patients had comorbidities. As many as 3,001 Covid patients also recuperated on Wednesday. The city now has 10,797 active cases, including 179 patients in hospitals and 10,618 in home isolation. Currently, there is no active Omicron case. Chief medical officer Virender Yadav said that daily cases would decrease further in a week. “The active cases have come down below 11,000, and our monitoring teams are ensuring the home isolation cases do not turn severe and that no Covid death occurs in home isolation. We are expecting that within a week, the daily new cases should come down significantly,” said Yadav. On Wednesday, 9,684 samples got collected for tests. Haryana reported 6,351 new cases on Wednesday, with a test positivity rate of 16.4%. While Gurugram registered the maximum number of new cases across the state, Faridabad remained second with 668, followed by Sonipat (391), Panchkula (387) and Hisar (373). Currently, the state has 39,565 active patients, of whom 37,990 are in home isolation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/city-records-over-2200-new-cases-1-more-death/articleshow/89144244.cms||Ipsita Pati

An FIR for theft and cheating has been registered, the police said on Wednesday. Rupender Kumar, a resident of Basai Enclave, ordered a mobile phone on Amazon on January 15. Two days later, the order was cancelled for some reasons. To enquire about the order, he called on the ‘customer care’ number that he found online. The call was received by a fraudster who took remote access to Rupender’s mobile phone on the pretext of fixing a bug in his Amazon account and emptied his bank account. In his complaint, Rupender claimed that the person who had picked up his call identified himself as a representative of the e-tailer and asked him to download “any desk” app and took remote access to his mobile phone. The fraudster, according to Rupender, also tricked him into sharing the details of his debit card and withdrew Rs 75,000 from his account. “The person asked me about the mode of payment. He asked me to share the details of my debit card which was used for making the payment. He told me that he would check why my order was cancelled and initiate either a refund or place a fresh order from my account,” Rupender told cops. “I never thought that a customer care number given on the internet would be wrong.” Based on his complaint, a case was registered under sections 379 (theft) and 420 (cheating) of IPC at the Sector 10 police station. Police said that an initial investigation revealed that the same number was used as the ‘customer care’ number of a leading travel company. And several people were duped of lakhs in Assam through the same number on the pretext of ticket booking, cops said. “Everything that appears on the internet may not be true, people should call only those customer care numbers which are shown on the official website of a company,” said police spokesperson Subhash Boken.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/a-customer-care-number-that-wasnt-man-cheated-of-75k/articleshow/89144245.cms||---

Police said the accused were traveling in the vehicle without a numberplate and were stopped at a checkpoint set up on Dwarka Expressway in view of Republic Day. On Tuesday, ASI Kuldeep along with head constable Yashpal, constables Surender and Naveen were checking vehicles at a checkpoint near Bajghera underpass on Dwarka Expressway.  “A white Honda City without a front numberplate took a turn from Bajghera village. We stopped it for checking and asked the youth seated inside to produce its documents,” a police officer said. Rizwan was in the driver’s seat while Samsad was sitting next to him. “They failed to produce any document of the vehicle and were unable to give any satisfactory reason. We got suspicious and inspected the entire vehicle. There was no numberplate on the front, while the rear numberplate was covered and turned out to be fake,” said ASI Kuldeep from Bajghera police station. The police then checked the details of the vehicle and found that the car was found registered on the name of Amit Chouhan in Delhi.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/two-steal-car-in-capital-arrested/articleshow/89144246.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||Flyovers & underpasses for a smooth ride to Faridabad soon?||GURUGRAM: The public works department (PWD) is exploring the possibility of constructing underpasses and flyovers on the Gurugram-Faridabad road to make the commute easier for users. The road, which links two major districts of Haryana, is one of the busiest stretches in the city. According to officials, three important junctions on the stretch — Ghata Chowk, Gwalpahari junction and Pali Chowk — are being looked upon as the areas where these underpasses or flyovers can be constructed to ease the flow of traffic. “In order to ensure smooth flow of traffic, we are looking at the possibility of constructing either flyovers or underpasses, along with service roads, at three critical junctions on the Gurugram-Faridabad road,” said a senior PWD official.The official said that, at present, they have floated a tender inviting bids for consultancy services for undertaking the feasibility assessment and preparing the detailed project report for the plan. “The agency to whom this tender will be allotted will get a time period of four months to firstly conduct a feasibility assessment and then, if the project is found to be executable, to prepare the DPR for the same. If the project is found to be feasible and things go as per plan, we expect to be able to commence work on the ground by next year, after completing all the paperwork and formalities. “At present, we cannot say which junctions will see the construction of which structures. That will all become clear only after the DPR is prepared,” the official added. According to the Comprehensive Mobility Management Plan of the GMDA, which was released in December 2020, the stretch is among the top 10 most dangerous roads in the city. With a high number of heavy vehicles using the road, it tends to be prone to mishaps.

---||Faridabad||Flyovers & underpasses for a smooth ride to Faridabad soon?||GURUGRAM: The public works department (PWD) is exploring the possibility of constructing underpasses and flyovers on the Gurugram-Faridabad road to make the commute easier for users. The road, which links two major districts of Haryana, is one of the busiest stretches in the city. According to officials, three important junctions on the stretch — Ghata Chowk, Gwalpahari junction and Pali Chowk — are being looked upon as the areas where these underpasses or flyovers can be constructed to ease the flow of traffic. “In order to ensure smooth flow of traffic, we are looking at the possibility of constructing either flyovers or underpasses, along with service roads, at three critical junctions on the Gurugram-Faridabad road,” said a senior PWD official.The official said that, at present, they have floated a tender inviting bids for consultancy services for undertaking the feasibility assessment and preparing the detailed project report for the plan. “The agency to whom this tender will be allotted will get a time period of four months to firstly conduct a feasibility assessment and then, if the project is found to be executable, to prepare the DPR for the same. If the project is found to be feasible and things go as per plan, we expect to be able to commence work on the ground by next year, after completing all the paperwork and formalities. “At present, we cannot say which junctions will see the construction of which structures. That will all become clear only after the DPR is prepared,” the official added. According to the Comprehensive Mobility Management Plan of the GMDA, which was released in December 2020, the stretch is among the top 10 most dangerous roads in the city. With a high number of heavy vehicles using the road, it tends to be prone to mishaps. If this project sees the light of day, the entire road stretch from NH-8 to Pali Chowkmay see a revamp in the coming years, with the GMDA also already working on a plan to improve SPR. While a plan to make the stretch between Ghata T-point and Vatika Chowk signal-free through the construction of flyovers has already been approved by the Authority, the GMDA is now working on further extending this plan to include all of SPR, right up to NH-8.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/faridabad/flyovers-underpasses-for-a-smooth-ride-to-fbd-soon/articleshow/89145614.cms||Sakshi Dayal

The children, police said, were allegedly trying to pull out iron reinforcement bars from the slab when it collapsed on Tuesday. They were pulled out of the rubble and taken to a nearby hospital but Nitesh (11), a resident of Ghori Bachhera village, and Akhil (13), of Kashiram colony, succumbed during treatment on Tuesday evening. Akhilesh (11), also a resident of Ghori Bachhera, who had not entered the drain but was standing on the slab when it collapsed, sustained severe injuries in the incident and is still undergoing treatment at a private hospital, police said. Greater Noida additional deputy commissioner of police, Vishal Pandey told TOI that the incident happened around 6 pm on Tuesday. “It seems that the three boys were trying to pull out the reinforcement bars from the slab covering a large drain along the roadside in Sector Mu when it broke and crushed them underneath. We were informed by local residents. Nitesh and Akhil died during treatment while Akhilesh is still under treatment,” the officer said, adding that the bodies have been handed over to the families after post-mortem. No complaints have been registered so far, he said. According to the police, several families in the area belong to lower-income groups. “There have been some incidents in the past where children have been found stealing reinforcement bars from slabs, which they try to sell as scrap for some money,” a senior officer of Dadri police station said. On January 11, two labourers had died and as many others were injured after a wall of an under-construction building collapsed in Noida’s Sector 26, police said. In another incident, two other labourers had succumbed after a wall of an under-construction building collapsed on them in Noida’s Sector 2 on November 15 last year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/2-children-die-as-drain-slab-collapses-on-them/articleshow/89144251.cms||Advitya Bahl

The accused lives on the floor above the woman’s residence in the same building. “We received a call from the woman on our helpline number around 7.30 am. She revealed that when she had gone into her bathroom to take a shower, she noticed a mobile phone hanging outside the bathroom window. She got hold of it and found that her video, while taking a shower, was being recorded on the device,” a senior police officer said. The woman informed the police about the incident and during probe it was found that the phone belonged to one of her neighbours, who lived on the floor above her, in the same building.“The man was arrested and taken into custody. During investigation, the accused said that he used to tie a string on his mobile phone and drop it towards the window of the woman’s washroom and make the videos,” the officer said. Initial investigation has revealed the accused had been making such videos for a long time, police said. He has been booked under 354 C (voyeurism) of the IPC and a case has been lodged at Madhuban Bapudham police station. “We have seized his mobile and are checking if he used to share the videos with anyone.

---||Noida||Noida: Smart bin, gadget to spot overflowing sewers ace Swachh contest||NOIDA: A gadget that blows the whistle on overflowing sewers, a smart dustbin with an object-detection sensor to segregate dry waste from wet, products made out of recycled household waste like chips packets and shampoo bottles — altruistic projects applying technology to big, societal problems earned accolades at the Noida Authority’s Swachh Innovative Technology Challenge. The contest, held on January 1, saw a total of 154 submissions in five categories — social inclusion, zero dump, plastic waste management, transparency, and liquid waste management. A gadget developed by a student of Amity University, Rajat Tyagi, sought to redress a problem that has vexed residents for years — overflowing sewers. The Sector 134 resident combined information and communication technologies (ICT) to develop a sewer overflow monitoring tool that aced the liquid waste management category of the awards. “I belong to Uttarakhand and when I came to Noida, I got a first-hand experience of living in a planned city. While I fell in love with the city, I noticed overflow sewers, mainly in rural areas, was a major nuisance. So, I thought of making an ICT-based sewer overflow monitoring tool,” Tyagi told TOI. So how does it work? According to Tyagi, the device sets off an alarm to the monitoring cells with information like time, date, location, etc whenever it detects overflow in sewers or drains. “Each device comes with a unique location tag, which will help the monitoring units to locate the device and thus drain the overflowing sewer. The device can also control the flow pumps at sewage pumping stations,” Tyagi added. Pivoting on zero waste, Sector 128-resident Nikhil Kumar has come up with a smart segregation dustbin (SSD) that has figured out a way to separate wet waste from dry. Ultrasonic sensors, Kumar said, installed in the dustbin allows it to detect human presence. Once opened, it triggers a direct current motor that also allows the user to throw the waste with zero contact. Once the waste is dumped, a loop inside the bin moves via an object-detection sensor which also determines if the waste is wet or dry. A moisture sensor then determines the direction of waste deflection while a servo motor initiates the segregation flap. “Segregation of domestic and commercial waste remains a large problem and my aim was to design a dustbin that is equipped with waste-detection technology, which can identify the type of garbage and then segregate it. The SSD was tested at various public places, like parks, society complexes, etc and the results were successful,” he said. Kumar was awarded the first prize in the ‘zero dump’ category. Piling plastic though not primarily a tech problem, but building a healthier ecosystem is and Sector 12-resident Raghav Sharma took up the challenge to create public utility products like a bench, bin and home décor items by recycling plastic waste such as chips packaging, shampoo bottles, and polythene. Sharma, who bagged the second prize in the plastic waste management category in the contest, said: “My objective was to utilise various kinds of plastic wastes and develop recycled products that can be used on a daily basis.” According to the Noida Authority, all participants will be given digital certificates; the winners will be rewarded cash prizes of Rs 51,000, Rs 31,000 and Rs 21,000 for first, second and third positions, respectively, on January 31.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/smart-bin-gadget-to-spot-overflowing-sewers-ace-swachh-contest/articleshow/89144253.cms||Anjali Singh

Initial investigations suggest the involvement of the man’s son, Lokesh, who has been absconding since the incident. According to the police, Lokesh wanted his father, Vipatram, to transfer the property belonging to the 55-year-old under his name, and the two had quarrelled over the matter several times in the past. “The incident took place around 2pm on the Chithera road, leading towards Palla village in Greater Noida. Vipatram was shot dead by an unidentified person. He had left his house just five minutes before the incident took place,” a senior officer of Greater Noida said. It was the locals in the area who informed the police about the incident, and soon after, a police team was sent to the spot and the man was rushed to the hospital. “Vipatram was declared dead on arrival by the hospital authorities. The family members of the man were informed about the incident. His wife has said that she suspects the involvement of their elder son, Lokesh, behind the incident,” the officer said. The woman informed the police that Lokesh used to quarrel with Vipatram and wanted to get the latter’s property under his name. “They used to have frequent quarrels and arguments over the property. The family had also arranged a Panchayat meeting regarding the property issue a few days ago, where Lokesh had threatened to kill his parents. On Wednesday afternoon when Vipatram left the house, Lokesh also left the house in a Santro car and allegedly killed him,” the officer said. A case under section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code has been registered against Lokesh following the complaint. “Two teams have been formed to nab Lokesh, who is absconding. We are scanning the CCTV footages of the area to know about the movement of the Santro car. The arrest would be made soon,” the officer said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/55-year-old-man-shot-son-under-police-lens/articleshow/89144257.cms||Advitya Bahl

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Tenure of delimitation panel ends, BBMP polls may get further delayed||BENGALURU: Though the BJP and Congress have begun preparations for the BBMP polls, which is expected to be held in April, chances are that it may get further delayed since the tenure of the delimitation committee appointed to redraw the boundaries of civic wards is set to end on Thursday. The committee was supposed to submit its report to the government before its tenure ends as it is crucial to go ahead with the polls. Sources said it’s a deliberate act by both the ruling and opposition party MLAs to delay the process by at least another one year. The government constituted the delimitation panel in February 2021 to reorganise the wards in accordance with the new BBMP Act, according to which the number of wards was increased from 198 to 243. However, the six-month term of the panel headed by BBMP chief commissioner ended in July 2021 and the government extended it by another six months. Officials from the department of urban development said the government has not given instruction on further extending the tenure till Wednesday. This is despite chief minister Basavaraj Bommai, who is in-charge of Bengaluru Urban district, recently stating that his government is ready for the elections in March-April. “The draft of the delimitation of wards is ready and it will be submitted to the government at an appropriate time,” said J Manjunath, deputy commissioner of Bengaluru Urban district and member of BBMP ward delimitation committee. The government also appears to be in no hurry to get the report from the panel since there is a hitch. The government had promised to include the villages located in the assembly constituencies at the periphery into the city limits when the BBMP Bill was enacted in December 2020. While legal issues came in the way, the government dropped the proposal and the delimitation committee prepared the draft considering the existing wards within the present city limits. However, this has upset BJP MLAs of constituencies like Bengaluru South, Mahadevapura, Bommanahalli, Yelahanka and Yeshwantpur, which have villages outside the BBMP boundary. They are urging the CM to include the identified villages into the city limits and not to accept the draft of delimitation till the issue is resolved. “It is the promise we have made to the people and we cannot go back on it. We are requesting the CM to expand the BBMP limits to include these villages,” said M Krishnappa, BJP MLA from Bengaluru South where 16 villages, including the Electronics City Area are outside the boundary of the city. This issue was discussed on Wednesday at the three-day meeting of BJP’s elected representatives from the city convened by Bommai to prepare the party for the polls.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/tenure-of-delimitation-panel-ends-bbmp-polls-may-get-further-delayed/articleshow/89144276.cms||B V Shiva Shankar

To begin with, these centres will offer 25 services like issuing caste, birth and residential certificates to villagers. “We want to increase the number of services to 100, including banking and Aadhaar-related works,” Bommai said. There will be dedicated teams to operate these centres which will be provided with seamless internet and other required technologies. “These centres will be a boon to villagers who are now forced to visit taluk headquarters to get even birth and caste certificates. Special cells will be set up in tahsildar offices to monitor the functioning of these centres and also address issues arising from time to time,” the CM said.He said these centres will be opened in all GPs across the state by March-end.

---||Bengaluru||Govt preparing ex-Isro staff list to help pvt cos||Bengaluru: The Centre, which is pushing reforms in the space sector aimed at boosting private participation, has created IN-SPACe (Indian National Space Promotion and Authorization Centre) to promote, permit and oversee private enterprises, is actively looking to help companies to have access to former Isro scientists and engineers — those who have superannuated or resigned — so as to bring in some experience and expertise. Terming the private space industry “nascent”, the department of space (DoS), on behalf of IN-SPACe has communicated to various Isro centres to collate details of such personnel. “IN-SPACe seeks the information of retired/resigned S&T personnel of DoS or Isro centres or units along with their willingness to be approached by non-governmental entities (NGEs), which is proposed to be made available to all NGEs through IN-SPACe,” a circular issued by Praveen S, deputy secretary, DoS, reads. TOI has a copy of the circular.The circular, while pointing out that the space industry in India is in a nascent stage, reads that there is, therefore, a need to have a comprehensive directory of knowledge and skilled workers in the space sector which would prove beneficial to the nation’s private players, helping them in their space activities.IN-SPACe chairperson Pawan Goenka told TOI: “...The private sector needs help as they won’t have the luxury of spending as much time as Isro did to achieve what it has. In this background, we found that there are so many very well qualified and trained scientists who are not with Isro anymore but would be willing to contribute. So, we thought it would be good if there’s a dedicated directory that can help companies.”He stressed that IN-SPACe would not be recommending anyone or be part of the recruitment process but would only be putting together a list of former Isro personnel — with a half-page or one-page biography — with their consent.“...The rest will be between companies and the individuals. We found that some firms already had such people and realised that not all would be able to access highly trained individuals. Also, from the Isro and IN-SPACe point of view, we think that if startups or new firms have such expertise and are mentored, their proposals will also be more mature and won’t require going back and forth,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/govt-preparing-ex-isro-staff-list-to-help-pvt-cos/articleshow/89144280.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Exams may be put off for want of guest lecturers||BENGALURU: As colleges in the city wait for guest lecturers to return to campuses, a few universities are likely to postpone semester exams scheduled for February so as to give faculty members more time to complete portions. Many government colleges in the city are heavily dependent on guest lecturers for completion of syllabus. However, 45 days ago, guest lecturers went on strike, demanding better pay and job security. The government responded by increasing the pay from Rs 13,000 to Rs 26,000 and Rs 32,000. It also invited applications online. Meanwhile, as colleges continue to wait for guest lecturers’ recruitment to be completed, existing permanent faculty members have to deal with the additional work load. “Our full-time faculty members are conducting classes for around 1,000 students every day. We are using the Zoom platform...,” said a lecturer from RC College (RCC) of Commerce. The college has 42 permanent and 57 guest lecturers. As a result, a few universities in the city are likely to postpone exams so as to give students and teachers breathing time to complete portions. Maharani Cluster University that has 250 guest lecturers and 210 permanent ones for its 7,000 students said it will extend the term so that portions can be covered. “We will conduct exams only after classes are fully held and portions completed. Exams will be postponed by 1.5 months. While we were supposed to hold exams by February, we might now take them to the third week of March, depending on when the guest lecturers join. Our teachers have completed their share of the portion and have now started with sections guest lectures were to handle. While some subjects are easy to tackle, others like Commerce are tough...,” said Gomathi Devi L, vice-chancellor of Maharani Cluster University. Apart from the teachers’ strike, closures due to the pandemic further added to loss of classes. Shrinivas S Balli, vice-chancellor, Nrupathunga University, said: “Our classes started in October and we could complete 70% of portions. The remaining is being handled now. Ideally, practical exams should have started by now. But owing to time lost due to Covid and the strike, we will push it by around 15 days.” While Bengaluru City University (BCU) said it has no plans to put off exams, government colleges under the university said BCU has to take into consideration the ground reality. “As per BCU calendar of events, February 10 is the last working day. They have to postpone the exams, otherwise government college students will find it difficult,” said the RCC lecturer. Colleges are hoping that guest lecturers will be back on campuses soon as the recruitment process has begun. As per the department of higher education, when applications were invited online, the government received around 60,000 entries for the post of guest lecturers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/exams-may-be-put-off-for-want-of-guest-lecturers/articleshow/89144282.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Gold loan firm exec’s body retrieved from lake; 2 held||Bengaluru: The highly decomposed body of a gold loan company executive, who went missing from Konanakunte on January 10, was found in Honnapura Lake near Magadi on Tuesday. Probe revealed that 29-year-old Diwakar B, a resident of Sarabandepalya, JP Nagar 2nd Phase, was abducted and murdered for money. Puttenahalli police have arrested two persons for allegedly murdering him and dumping the body in the lake. They also dumped a bike in the waterbody. The accused are Manjunath, 28, a tender coconut seller, and Muniraj, 24, an employee with a bar. Both are residents of Sunkadakatte, west Bengaluru, and from Kunigal, Tumakuru district. One more suspect, identified as Rakshita, Muniraj’s wife, is at large and efforts are on to arrest her. Diwakar’s mother Lakshmi had filed a complaint about the disappearance of her son with Puttenahalli police. She told police that he had dropped his wife Shivagami near her office in JP Nagar 6th Phase around 10am and left for Sunkadakatte to attend his official duty. Later, he went incommunicado. His mobile phone was switched off and he did not return home. After finding that Diwakar had spoken with Manjunath before switching off his mobile phone, Puttenahalli police picked him up for investigation. Based on the information provided by Manjunath, they arrested his associate Muniraj. Home delivery of gold loan proved costly Police said Diwakar was attached to a unit that handled home delivery of gold loans, a facility that was introduced by the private firm after Covid-19. The executive would visit customer residences and sanction the loan after appraising the gold. Manjunath and Muniraj were in financial trouble and hence hatched a plan to invite gold loan firm employees to their residence to rob them. They contacted SRS Gold firm and said they wanted to pledge 65 grams of gold. As assigned by the firm, Diwakar went to the residence of Muniraj at Hoysalanagar in Sunkadakatte. The accused, along with Muniraj’s wife Rakshita, strangled him to death and robbed him of around Rs 3 lakh. They wrapped the body in a sack and transported it near Magadi on his bike. They tied a huge stone to the body to prevent it from floating up and dumped it into Honnapura Lake. “We detained the suspects with the help of phone call records. They have confessed to the crime. The body was retrieved based on information provided by them,” said Harish Pandey, deputy commissioner of police (south).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/gold-loan-firm-execs-body-retrieved-from-lake-2-held/articleshow/89144285.cms||---

One man has been arrested and booked under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act. Sources with the cargo intelligence unit of Bengaluru Customs at Kempegowda International Airport said the drug bust took place on Saturday after officials found something amiss about a parcel that had arrived after being declared as “documents and bag”. “We noticed a leather pouch which was unusual. We cut it open to find an inner layer with something concealed in black plastic. We opened it to find two plastic packets with a white powdery substance that a lab test later established as heroin,” said an investigating officer. The seized drugs weighed 754 grams and are estimated to be worth Rs 5.3 crore in the international market. With the Bill of Entry showing the receiver of the packet to be a man in Attiguppe, customs sleuths laid a trap as the parcel agency went to deliver it at the suspect’s residence on Monday. “He dodged us the whole day but finally, by evening, signed and received the packet. That is when we moved in and apprehended him,” the officer said. Because of the ongoing investigation, the suspect was only identified as a 59-year-old man. During interrogation, he revealed that he was working for an unidentified man in Johannesburg, South Africa, who gave him directions via WhatsApp. “The Bengaluru man was scheduled to fly with the heroin to Delhi and hand it over to another man as per the orders of the South African. He was to get Rs 40,000 for the job. It has been established that he smuggled drugs in similar fashion for the last six months,” another officer said. On Tuesday evening, the suspect was produced before a magistrate and remanded in judicial custody at Central Prison, Parappana Agrahara. Further probe into drug operations through Bengaluru airport cargo is under way. Cops are also looking at the gang’s links in the city.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/heroin-worth-5-3cr-seized-one-arrested/articleshow/89144286.cms||Petlee Peter
---||Bengaluru||Boy with rare disease seeks stem cell aid in Bengaluru||BENGALURU: Vijayendra, a seven-month-old baby, has been diagnosed with Benta disease, a rare primary immunodeficiency disorder caused by mutations in the CARD11 gene. This case of genetic mutation has affected a handful of persons across the globe, say his doctors. The only hope for survival is a blood stem cell transplant and the family is looking for a matching donor. The DKMS-BMST Foundation of India, a Bengaluru-based blood stem cell registry, is coordinating the search for a matching donor for Vijayendra. With minimal therapeutic intervention available for Benta disease so far, the treatment given to Vijayendra is experimental and is based on his reactions to previous treatments. Currently, he is being treated under Dr Stalin Ramprakash, consultant-paediatric hematology, oncology and bone marrow transplant, Aster CMI Hospital. The family lost one child in 2012 and were concerned when Vijayendra started having swelling in the abdomen, and fever. After seeing alarming blood reports, he was brought to Bengaluru for further tests. On detailed evaluation, the infant was diagnosed with Benta by Dr Sagar Bhattad, paediatric immunologist at Aster CMI Hospital. “There are four such cases recorded in India so far. The family lost a child with a big spleen in 2012. Those with Benta disease will have very high B cell (a type of lymphocytes) count. In this boy’s case, the B cell count was 75,000 against 1,200-1,500. We further did a genetic test,” said Dr Bhattad. “...Vijayendra is currently stable. The only solution is stem cell transplant,” said Dr Ramprakash. After realising that the boy can survive only through stem cell transplant, his parents have appealed to the public to register in the stem cell registry. In India, less than 0.1% of the population is registered as potential donors, especially because of unawareness and apprehensions people have around blood stem cell donation, said Patrick Paul, CEO, DKMS-BMST. “Many patients are in dire need of unrelated donors as 70% of the patients are dependent on them. We encourage people to come forward and register online as potential lifesavers,” said Paul. To reach out to people across India, the foundation has launched a virtual drive where one can register online to turn potential lifesavers and help patients like Vijayendra.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/boy-with-rare-disease-seeks-stem-cell-aid/articleshow/89144287.cms||Sunitha Rao R

Based on a complaint filed by the 24-year-old woman, PV Nageshwar of Jnanabharathi was booked under IPC sections 354A (sexual harassment), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace), 506 (criminal intimidation), 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman), and 420 (cheating). The woman said Nageshwar was her friend for five years. “He promised to get me a government job through his contacts. In return, he asked me to lend him money to buy an iPhone. I raised a personal loan of Rs 80,000 from my bank and Nageshwar agreed to pay monthly instalments for three years. He bought the phone in mid-2020 but didn’t pay the instalments. By November, bank officials began calling me. I reminded him repeatedly but in vain.

---||Bengaluru||TCS No. 2 in global IT services brand value||Bengaluru: India’s software supremacy continues to show itself on the global stage. Indian IT services firms have outpaced their IT peers in the US, growing their brand value significantly over the past year, showed a brand valuation report from Brand Finance. The average growth of Indian brands since 2020 is an impressive 51%, while the US brands have on average contracted by 7%.Accenture has retained the top spot as the most valuable brand for the fourth consecutive year with its brand value increasing by 39% to $36.2 billion over the last year, the report said. Since the beginning of the pandemic in 2020, the IT firm’s value has seen a 43% increase – standing out among other brands in the US.TCS pipped IBM to take the second spot, with the brand valued at $16.8 billion, up 12% year-on-year and 24% since 2020. This growth was driven by the investments it made in its employees, customer equity and strong financial performance, the report said. TCS touched the $25 billion revenue mark in calendar year 2021, as digital transformation continued to create robust demand for IT outsourcing. TCS chief marketing officer Rajashree, said, “The ranking is a validation of our increased market relevance and focus on innovation and transformation of our clients, their customers, and the larger community. Our customer-centric strategy and focus on research and innovation over the last decade positions us to capitalise on upcoming opportunities.”David Haigh, CEO and chairman of Brand Finance, attributed TCS' rise to strong financial growth and continued investments in a new global brand positioning last year. "I also see TCS’ focused commitment to serving the needs of its employees, customers, and communities, which always – in the long run – drives brand performance,” he said. TCS, for instance, is making huge investments in brand building in customer markets. It will be the title sponsor of Jaguar Formula E team, which is a championship using electric vehicles. The partnership between Jaguar and TCS involves research and data analytics around automotive engineering and sustainable energy with an aim for low carbon emissions.IBM dropped to No. 4 in the 2022, with a brand value at $10.6 billion, a 34% decrease from the previous year, and a 50% drop overall since 2020. The divestment of Kyndryl caused a loss of over $19 billion in revenue, which impacted IBM’s brand value, the report said.Infosys moved to the third spot in the 2022 rankings from No. 5 last year, showing the fastest increase in brand value among all brands in the ranking this year. There was a 52% growth in value in the past year to $12.8 billion. Over two years, the gain is as much as 80%. Infosys's revenue has been the fastest growing among the big Indian IT players. It has also continued to build brand recognition globally by nurturing sports collaborations with ATP, Roland Garros, and the Australian Open. All six Indian brands in the Brand Finance IT Services 25 ranking feature among the top 10 fastest-growing IT Services brands over the course of 2020-2022. Following TCS and Infosys, four more Indian brands are among the global elite -- Wipro at No. 7, HCL at No. 8, Tech Mahindra at No. 15, and LTI at No. 22.Wipro has a brand value of $6.3 billion, an increase of 48% over the past year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/tcs-no-2-in-global-it-services-brand-value/articleshow/89144290.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Recharged Aditi gears up for her LPGA campaign||Bengaluru: Ace golfer Aditi Ashok feels she is closer to breaking the jinx on the LPGA than she has ever been in five seasons on the biggest tour. The 23-year-old Bengalurean kick-starts her season at the $2 million Gainbridge LPGA at Boca Rio in Florida on Thursday.Aditi, who missed an Olympic medal by a whisker in Tokyo, and had three top-10s last season despite suffering from Covid-19 in the middle of the year, is confident of building on those results this season.“When you are playing with the top 100 every week, I think if you have reached (the top-10), you do definitely have the game to win, otherwise it is hard to get to that level or even stay at that level. Yeah, every player has the potential to win,” Aditi told TOI before leaving for the US.“It’s about finding the stuff that works for you that week and making sure you maximise every part of your game to get the most out of it and finish as the best player in the field. Obviously, the three top-10s and the Olympics was great. I think just the fact that I played well at the Olympics and I could contend with such good players gave me a lot of confidence, which is why I had two top-10s after that. If with that physical state I had two top-10s, I feel like I am definitely in a better position now,” she pointed out.The three-time winner on the Ladies European Tour should be ready for the challenges ahead as she had around eight weeks of rest, with good home food, and has taken steps towards regaining the muscle she had lost while she was down with Covid-19, and more importantly, has been able to fine-tune her game with a new set of irons.“Physically, better prepared than how I was when I finished the season. I was happy to get two months of rest, eat healthy food, get some practice, and all of that helped me recuperate my body,” the Bengalurean said.“The key is just getting into that position of playing with the leaders, being in the leader groups, being in the top-5 through the tournament and then eventually getting the chance to win. It will come eventually, but it is important for me to put myself in that position,” she said.Besides dealing with her own expectations, Aditi will have added pressure, especially after she won over a billion hearts with her heroic show at the Olympics. “I had my own expectations through the last 5-6 years, ever since I turned pro. But now I feel the expectations would be from other people as well. I am going to try and not think about any of that much, and deal with my expectations, my goals, and try and play the best every week,” said the world No. 124.Armed with a new set of irons, Aditi is keen to make it count. “With equipment, I have gotten a little more knowledgeable about what suits my swing speed and my game. So, that helped me make a decision. Even though I finished tied sixth – her final event on the LPGA -- with the very first week I played, I really liked them and have had enough time to get used to them in the off-season,” she signed off.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/recharged-aditi-gears-up-for-her-lpga-campaign/articleshow/89144292.cms||---

But on the course, the seven-horse event was an exciting affair as Trevor Patel piloted the fancied Zuccarelli to a come-from-behind victory. The Pune Derby winner, from the stables of Pesi Shroff, lived up to its top billing and outpaced Prithviraj-trained All Attractive (Suraj Narredu up) and Silvarius (Srinath up), pushing the other two to the second and third positions respectively.Patel was slow off the blocks and was at the rear for the better part of the mile-and-a-half contest. Starting the home stretch in the fifth position, Patel went for the final push with Zuccarelli gradually cutting the lead of its competitors and breaking into the lead. Eventually, the Mumbai-based horse won to wear the Derby sash and earn the winner’s prize of Rs 82.77 lakh. Eternal Blaze (C S Jodha up) finished fourth.Speaking about his horse's victory, Shroff said, "Zuccarelli did really well. Trevor (Patel) settled him beautifully and got him into a good rhythm and was on the bridle all the way. That really served him well in the end." Shroff added that the next destination for his champion horse will be the Indian Derby scheduled to be held in Mumbai on February 6.Results: 1.

---||Chennai||Covid-19: Chennai doctors divided over effectiveness of monoclonal antibody treatment||CHENNAI: A day after Vellore-based virologist Dr Gangandeep Kang raised a red flag over indiscriminate use of monoclonal antibodies, doctors from across the city pulled out strands of evidence to argue for and against the therapy with evidence from medical literature and views from experts across the globe. Monoclonal antibodies are laboratory-made proteins that mimic the immune system’s ability to fight off pathogens. In Covid patients, these proteins bind to the spike protein of the SARs-COV-2 virus, blocking the entry to the healthy cells and protecting the body. But some doctors say that most products used in India do not work for the Omicron variant, making the treatment ineffective. The debate among doctors on social media and inside duty rooms began late on Sunday night after Dr Kang tweeted that her 90-year-old uncle in Chennai, who also had diabetes was advised admission and antibody therapy because he was in contact with someone who tested positive for viral infection. The licensed monoclonal antibody products used in India do not neutralise Omicron, which is now seen in more than 90% of patients, she said. Most patients will do well with or without treatment, but when patients given antibodies do well, doctors will “ascribe that to their treatment and the hospitals will laugh all the way to the bank”, she said. Even though some patients can afford Rs 1 lakh for the treatment, “its unethical, immoral and unscientific,” she said calling for doctors to teach and practice better medicine than this. She also nudged patients to ask for what each drug is expected to do and the evidence to back that up. Hospitals charge anywhere between Rs 75,000 to Rs 1 lakh for the drug.  Some doctors agree. The government hospitals, including the Government Corona Hospital in Guindy, do not prescribe them to their patients for two reasons. “These drugs are expensive, and we don’t buy them. But more importantly, less expensive drugs are working well,” said hospital director Dr K Narayanaswamy. But infectious diseases experts in private hospitals argue that it may be too early to dismiss the products in India as ineffective. “Many symptomatic elderly patients, particularly those with comorbidities have it the worst. Even among them those who are unvaccinated or vaccinated before nine months have severe fatigue, brain fog and other complications,” said infectious diseases expert Dr Subramanian Swaminathan of Gleneagles Global Hospital. At his hospital at least 380 patients have received one dose of monoclonal antibodies as an outpatient (or day care) procedure and just one among them returned to hospital for admissions, he said. “I do see positive results when the drug is administered to the right patient. In countries like the US, the drug is administered even in clinics,” he said. But not all infectious diseases experts agree. Apollo Hospitals infectious diseases expert Dr V Ramasubramanian said his patients were not administered monoclonal antibodies. “There was no need. Most patients had relief with paracetamol and some required remdesiver as outpatient,” he said. “We don’t have the evidence that these drugs work,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/doctors-divided-over-effectiveness-of-monoclonal-antibody-treatment/articleshow/89144294.cms||Pushpa Narayan

The government had originally proposed to construct a pedestrian subway near SDNB Vaishnav College. In the public consultation meeting held regarding this last July, residents opposed it and demanded a vehicular underpass at the railway level crossing (LC no:26) so that they need not wait every time the gates were closed for local trains to cross. Pallavaram MLA I Karunanithi said, "After several rounds of the talks with the highway minister (EV Velu) and Southern Railway, the design has been changed now. Cars, bikes and small buses can use the subway now".  The initial cost of the proposal was around Rs 4.5 crore. Now, it has increased to Rs 92 crore, show official estimates. The cost will be shared between the state and railways government agencies on a 50:50 basis, he said. However, a section of traders and residents from eastern side of Chromepet have opposed the new design too. They now want heavy vehicles like trucks and buses to access the subway. V Santhanam, of Chromepet, said, "Though it involves a lot of practical problems it would be better if the highway engineers can consult higher-ups or involve the Highway Research Station before saying a firm no to their request."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/chromepet-subway-design-tweaked-to-support-movement-of-cars-bikes/articleshow/89144295.cms||Ram Sundaram

With shelters being forced to scale down operations and attend only to emergencies, they are appealing to the general public to pitch in and transport injured animals to the shelters.About 25% of the staff at The Blue Cross of India (BCI) have tested positive, says Chinny Krishna, co-founder, BCI. “We have had to put elective surgeries on hold and rescues will be restricted to genuine emergencies,” says Chinny, adding that three vehicles are still plying for rescue operations. “There may be a delay in ambulance services so request people to bring injured animals to our shelter instead of waiting.”With about 2,000 animals in the shelter, the existing staff has also been working overtime. “We have volunteers coming on weekends.”Velu TM, who is in charge of social media and operations at BCI , says that they are able to manage with the help of volunteers. “But we insist that all of them are double vaccinated,” he says. “But, if you spot an animal in distress, if the injuries are minor, do try to get it treated by a local veterinarian and then bring them to us. You can also contact local corporation offices for help. In case of emergencies, we shall always help.”Anitha Balasubramanian, for instance, began volunteering at BCI from last Saturday. “I have been following their posts on social media and decided to volunteer. Last Saturday, I walked about 10 dogs that are in the abandoned pedigree dogs section. I intend to volunteer every Saturday, “ she says.Shravan Krishnan, who runs Besant Memorial Animal Dispensary (BMAD), says that though they had to scale down operations for a while, they are getting back to full-time work.“We stopped seeing outpatients, and doing ABC surgeries from January 11 to 24 as many of our staff tested positive. We were only taking care of inpatients, doing urgent rescues and performing emergency procedures,” he says.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/services-at-animal-centres-hit-as-several-employees-test-ve/articleshow/89144296.cms||Priya Menon

Help poured in for the constable struggling to save her husband and 7-year-old daughter who met with an accident and are critical. Policemen in Tiruvallur district came together and managed to collect Rs 3.4 lakh to bear the medical expenses of the duo. On January 14, Renuka’s husband Raajasekaran and daughter Harshatha were walking down the road at Maduranhakam when an unidentified vehicle hit them from behind, leaving them severely injured. Passersby found their address and informed Renuka. With no CCTV camera footage available the vehicle remains untraced. The injured two were taken to different private hospitals in Guindy. Only after reaching the hospital did Renuka know that her child was critical. Since her head injuries are severe, Harshatha needs a huge sum for surgery, which was difficult for Renuka to manage. Some of her friends posted about the incident in the police whatsapp groups. It caught the attention of Tiruvallur SP Varun Kumar who forwarded the same to the personnel in the district. Those willing to contribute were asked to come forward. Policemen from 24 police stations, five AWPS and traffic units and other special units managed to garner a sum of Rs 3.4 lakh. The amount was handed over to Renuka. “My child is still unconscious and my husband couldn’t recollect what happened on the fateful day. This amount was of great help to me. Besides mental trauma, I couldn’t handle the financial crises as I require more money to save my child,” Renuka told TOI. “It was a small help to our fraternity at the time of emergency. More than the money, this will give hope to all of them that they are not left alone during a crisis,” said Sathish Kumar, a police constable.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/cops-come-together-to-help-colleague-in-distress/articleshow/89144308.cms||---

They used to borrow money from each other whenever they fell short. But when Younis demanded his money back, the four picked a fight with him. Later, they got drunk and murdered Younis, police said. A murder case was registered against them.In 2018, the four accused were granted conditional bail. They then jumped bail and fled to Assam. Since police were not able to trace them, a non- bailable warrant was issued against them the same year.Three months ago, Perumbakkam inspector Magudeeswari took up the case and went to Assam with a team. They camped there off and on trying to trace the four.Police said that it was not easy to trace them or enter the village, nab them and leave safely. “We had to gain the confidence of a few of their relatives. Initially, they were unwilling to reveal their whereabouts,” said Magudeeswari. The accused did odd jobs in Jorhat district and kept shifting their hideouts with the help of the locals. The four have been lodged in Chengalpet prison.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/4-murder-accused-nabbed-from-assam/articleshow/89144318.cms||---

But his maiden attempt failed when alarms at an ATM kiosk at Chetpet he targeted blared. Tracked and arrested in no time, the dejected father is lodged in a city jail now. Police said Ranjith Kumar of Annai Sathya Nagar was father of two children – a five-year-old daughter and a three-year-old son. He was driving the garbage collection vehicle for the past three years. Employed in the Mylapore zone initially, he was assigned duty at Kodambakkam zone from Monday. His was desperate for money after his wife told him that they needed a huge sum to admit their daughter, now in a government school, in a private school next academic year. On noticing unmanned SBI ATM kiosk on Harrington Road in Chetpet, Ranjith Kumar decided to break it open. "At 3am on Tuesday, he disconnected the GPS of his vehicle near Valluvar Kottam and changed his uniform before entering the ATM," said deputy commissioner, Kilpauk, K Karthikeyan. When hit the machine with a screwdriver, the alarm went off and he fled. On alert from the bank, the DC's special team checked CCTV footages in the vicinity, and found the garbage collection vehicle with flickering stickers. With the help of the stickers, which are usually pasted on vehicles on night shift, police zeroed in on Ranjith Kumar. The first-time offender did not take long to admit to the offence . A day before striking at the ATM, Ranjith attended an interview at a digital payment company and was waiting for the job offer, police said. He was booked for offences such as house-trespass or house-breaking by night and theft, and remanded in judicial custody.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/conservancy-worker-breaks-atm-to-pay-daughters-school-fee-held/articleshow/89144320.cms||Sindhu Kannan
---||Chennai||Chennai metro rail mobility cards to launch in February||CHENNAI: Passengers walking into metro stations to board a train may soon be able to use a smartcard to park their vehicle, shop, and, perhaps in future, even tap it to travel in an MTC bus as the Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL) is likely to launch the National Common Mobility Card (NCMC) in February. Officials said installation of card readers have begun in metro stations and a trial will be conducted soon. “We need around two weeks to install the readers and conduct a trial,” said a CMRL official, adding: “NCMCs will be an open-loop card compared with the closed-loop smartcard we have right now,” the official added. The NCMC, envisaged by the ministry of housing and urban affairs and launched in 2019, enables seamless travel by metro rail, MTC and other transport systems besides retail shopping and purchasing and banking transactions. Officials said NCMC-compliant RuPay debit card will work similar to the existing contactless metro rail smartcards. Nonetheless, unlike the smartcards, which can be used only for metro rides and for parking vehicles in stations, the NCMC can also be used in other modes of transport like MTC and suburban trains when those transit systems launch the service. These cards could also be used in metro rail facilities in other cities in the country. Already metro rail in Bengaluru and Delhi are readying to launch the facility. The other difference between existing metro rail smartcards and NCMC is that the ticket amount is stored in the former in a pre-paid format and deducted at the gates while using the latter would involve a bank transaction. It will be a transaction between the card issuing bank and the acquirer bank that will partner with CMRL to enable fare collection. “NCMC and QR-code tickets will be given priority over the existing smartcard and the tokens. We are also working to launch account-based ticketing where passengers can use their credit or debit card directly to tap on the AFC gates and walk in,” a metro rail official said. Commenting on the development, Sivasubramaniam Jayaraman, manager-transport systems, Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP-India) said, "NCMC is a stored-value card that works even while offline. NCMC needs to be looked at as a city centric card which shall enable tap and go options for commuters traveling in metro, bus and other modes. The NCMC would set a new direction for indigenous payment which can be used across TN.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/metro-rail-mobility-cards-in-feb/articleshow/89144324.cms||---

The multi-section digital axle counter (MSDAC) that uses electromagnetic sensors to count wheels and detect trains, their direction and speed on a track has already been installed on some sections that are prone to flooding and will be extended to the entire Chennai division in two years. The state-of the-art system has been installed on Guduvancheri-Chengalpet third line, Egmore-Kodambakkam, Avadi-Pattabiram stretches and at stations like Chennai Egmore, Chennai Central, Omalur, Salem Town, Erode, Virapandy Road, Tirupur, Ernakulam Town, Kayamkulam, Quilon, Irumpanam in 2021-22, said Southern Railway additional general manager B G Mallya during the Republic Day celebrations on Wednesday. Sources said sections like Egmore-Kodambakkam and Avadi-Pattabiram are prone to water logging and the new system would come in handy when signals don’t work. Work to install sensors and allied equipment on Avadi-Ambattur section is on and will be completed soon. All main routes from the city have been divided into small sections where installation will be taken up. Chief public relations officer B Guganesan said the new system is more reliable for detecting trains not affected by the condition of tracks like water logging and traction currents. “It also helps in easy integration and implementation of a centralized traffic control and train protection system (KAVACH). The new system is being provided as a replacement to the existing systems which have completed their service life,” he added. Other safety measures being carried out include complete track renewal of 182km along with deep screening of 788 track km till December 2021, installing 19 hot axle box detectors and online monitoring of rolling stock to detect defective wheels, bearings of coaches and locomotives.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/new-system-for-train-detection-on-key-routes/articleshow/89144325.cms||---

Around 10pm, a few residents of the area saw saleswoman Gomathi, who had kept the shop open by switching off the lights, loading gunny bags into a mini truck with the help of three men. Suspecting that something was amiss, the residents confronted the saleswoman who tried to dodge them saying the rice was meant to be transported to another PDS shop in the locality. They questioned her for sending them away despite possessing a huge stock, but she began to give out contradictory replies. The residents then began videographing the loading of rice bags. An argument broke out, with the woman asking the residents to stop filming her. Convinced she was smuggling out the rice bags, a few of the residents also alerted the Peerkankaranai police. As soon as a team arrived at the spot, the woman apologized for her act.Later, police seized two tonnes of PDS rice meant for distribution and arrested saleswoman Gomathi, 45, van driver Rahulnath, 28, and cleaner Shankaranarayan, 28, before launching a hunt for salesman Pandian, who managed to give the slip when the argument was on. The arrested were handed over to the civil supplies CID sleuths.Preliminary inquiries revealed that the rice was being sent to Andhra Pradesh. The woman had stocked up the rice bags that were meant for distribution in the past few weeks.The residents alleged that smuggling of PDS rice was rampant in the area and that they had been sent back on many occasions citing non-availability of stock.Civil Supplies CID will probe the matter to find out how long the smuggling has been happening.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/citizens-thwart-attempt-to-smuggle-hoarded-pds-rice/articleshow/89144327.cms||---

Police, based on preliminary investigation, said the gang attacked K Karthik Kumar’s house as he had complained to police about illicit arrack brewing and sales in the village and illegal leasing of a pond in the village for catching fish.In a twist to the case, Nambi Rajan, one of the gang members, got himself admitted to a hospital on Tuesday night and preferred a police complaint saying Kumar had assaulted him. Apparently, the inspector, despite knowing that it is a false complaint, has chosen to register Rajan’s complaint against Kumar, said police sources. The inspector has also informed Kumar that he would register a case against him.As per Kumar’s complaint, on Tuesday night, when he and his wife Aruna, both dentists, returned from their clinic to their home, one Nalanthula, nephew of Nambi Rajan, abused them. Soon, Nambi Rajan, Muthu Pandi and his son Raja arrived. One of them pulled out a sword and threatened Kumar. The couple rushed into their house and locked the door. The gang pelted stones at the house and damaged the doors. As they could not break open the door, they damaged the garden, pots and everything they found outside the house. To avoid being caught in the CCTV camera, they had already damaged the streetlights. Vadugachimathil had shot into prominence four years ago when CCTV cameras were installed in the entire village.Karthik Kumar, who is also a commandant of the Tamil Nadu Home Guards (TNHG) wing in Tirunelveli, had recently given a written complaint to authorities about illegal leasing of the village pond and sale of illicit arrack in the village.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/doctors-house-attacked-for-plaint-against-illicit-arrack-sale-in-tirunelveli/articleshow/89144328.cms||---
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Don’t provoke us, we know how to talk, says ex-minister to BJP||CHENNAI: BJP leader and MLA Nainar Nagendran had tweeted that his words had been misunderstood, but BJP leaders should warn their partymen to refrain from making such provocative statements, former fisheries minister D Jayakumar said. Responding to queries from reporters about the controversial remarks of Nagendran during a protest in Chennai on Tuesday that the AIADMK lacked spine and manliness in the state assembly, Jayakumar warned the BJP not to provoke the AIADMK.  “It is not good to provoke us. Else we will be forced to provoke them. We also know how to talk and can reply with a hundred words for every word they speak. But it is good if they don’t,” said Jayakumar. He, however, went soft on Nagendra, stating that the latter tweeted that his statement at the protest in Valluvar Kottam in Chennai was misunderstood and that it was equal to apologising. “He himself did not understand what he said. So there is an ethos of alliance and companionship and it is good to protect it. It is democratic to forgive after he expressed denial,” said Jayakumar.  Asked if Nagendran’s remarks should be treated as his or that of his party, Jayakumar said that Tamil Nadu BJP leaders should clarify it. He justified Nagendran’s tweet saying his remarks had been misunderstood as the reason for AIADMK leaders O Panneerselvam and Edappadi K Palaniswami not issuing a statement to condemn the BJP MLA. To a question, he added that the alliance with the BJP will continue for the urban local body polls too as it was for the parliamentary, assembly and rural local body polls.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/dont-provoke-us-we-know-how-to-talk-ex-min-to-bjp/articleshow/89144330.cms||---
---||Chennai||Chennai residents want barricades on East Coast Road removed||CHENNAI: Kamraj Nagar residents in Thiruvanmiyur have demanded that barricades on East Coast Road opposite Marundeeswarar Temple be removed. Earlier, vehicles entering the city from Mahabalipuram or Puducherry were using ECR till the LB road junction. But a few years ago, barricades were placed at the junction of ECR and Kamaraj Nagar South Avenue opposite Chennai Central Cooperative Bank. As a result, all Chennai-bound vehicles had to take a left turn at this junction and travel through interior roads of Kamaraj Nagar to reach LB Road signal. As portions of ECR were gradually widened, most heavy vehicles started preferring ECR over Old Mahabalipuram Road (OMR) to avoid traffic bottlenecks and toll stretches. Kamaraj Nagar, which was developed by the Tamil Nadu Housing Board predominantly for residential use, began witnessing frequent traffic jams, particularly during peak hours. Subsequently, in order to restrict entry of buses and trucks into Kamaraj Nagar, Chennai police installed barriers along the congested interior roads. Within a matter of a few months, these barriers on the junction of Kamaraj Nagar and LB Road were also removed. “Initially, it was stated that the blockade and height restriction barriers were only temporary measures. However, they have now apparently become permanent. This has led to the entire Kamaraj Nagar area, once serene and tranquil, becoming a major traffic bottleneck,” said advocate R Visveswaran, who filed a complaint with the Chennai Police and Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC). The 400-metre stretch along ECR (from the barricades to the entrance of Thiruvanmiyur bus terminus) has been converted into a full-fledged vegetable and fruit market. Heavy vehicles ply on the stretch round the clock, resulting in traffic chaos, he said. While GCC's assistant engineer blamed the police department, Kapil Kumar C Saratkar, Additional Commissioner of Police (Traffic) said, they will look into the matter urgently.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/residents-want-barricades-on-ecr-removed/articleshow/89144331.cms||Ram Sundaram

During the celebrations, senior officials and visitors continued to sit on their chairs as the state anthem Tamil Thai Vazhthu was being played.Some people who witnessed the incident entered into an argument with RBI officials who chose not to stand for disrespecting the song penned by scholar Mamonmaniam Sundaram. RBI officials claimed that there was no specific notification instructing officials to stand up while playing the anthem.Media personnel who were invited to cover the programme videographed the heated arguments between RBI officials and another set of people. When this issue was brought to the notice of the police, some RBI officials stated that if a complaint is received in this regard, appropriate action will be taken.Police personnel claimed that they would consult legal experts in this regard.

---||Chennai||Consider evacuation of village in Sathyamangalam tiger reserve, night traffic ban, says Madras high court||CHENNAI: In a bid to prevent wildlife deaths caused by road accidents in Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve (STR), the Madras high court has directed the NHAI to consider prohibiting vehicular movement between 9pm and 6am on NH-958, which passes through the reserve. NH-958 connects Coimbatore and Bengaluru via Mysuru. “Statistics show that during the last 10 years, (between 2012-2021) as many as 152 wild animals, including three leopards, were killed in road accidents on the NH,” a division bench of Justice V Bharathidasan and Justice N Sathish Kumar said on Wednesday. “It has been further brought to the notice of this court that there are high vehicular movements, both heavy vehicles and passenger vehicles, on the NH and the drivers of those vehicles are not adhering to speed limits which ultimately results in accidents frequently,” the court added. This apart, the bench also directed the state government to ascertain the possibilities of evicting the entire Thengumarahada village located in the core area of STR and rehabilitate them in an alternative location. “The road between Thengumarahada and Bannari Main Road runs in the core area which falls within STR and 30% of the tiger population moves in and around that area. This area is also the breeding place for tiger and other wildlife animals,” the court said. It is a vulnerable area and it is where the wild animals are supposed to move freely, but, the above lone village affects the free movement of wild lives. In the said circumstances, the people in that village are required to be rehabilitated to some other areas and if it is done, it would facilitate the free movement of wildlife animals in the area, the judges added. The court made the suggestions while hearing a batch of pleas seeking action against elephant poaching and wildlife deaths in road accidents.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/consider-evacuation-of-village-in-tiger-reserve-night-traffic-ban-hc/articleshow/89144334.cms||---
---||Chennai||Thaiyur lake, Nemmeli wetland new birding spots in Chennai||CHENNAI: An estuarine ecosystem in Nemmeli on ECR and a fresh water lake at Thaiyur on OMR are the new watching-spots for birders, attracting a good number of migrants including species of ducks and waders. Recently, birders recorded 12,000 ducks belonging to five species in both the places together. The ducks had come to the Pallikaranai marshland at the beginning of the migratory season and following sudden showers during the first week of January flocked to the two locations. Garganey, northern pintail, northern shoveler, Eurasian wigeon, common teal and gadwall are among the duck species spotted. These birds are winter migrants which wing their way across thousands of kilometres from the Central Asian region (Russia, Kazakhstan, etc.,) to southern peninsular India. The Nature Trust founder K V R K Thirunaranan, whose team is monitoring birds, said the new spots are located nearly 35 km south of the city. While the one at Nemmeli is an estuarine ecosystem, the one at Thaiyur is an irrigation tank, he said. Unlike the Pallikaranai marshland or the Perumbakkam wetland, the water bodies at Nemmeli and Thaiyur are not protected areas and come within the Tiruporur range of the forest department. The department should provide the required protection to these water bodies at least during the migratory season to help avoid poaching activities, say birders. Thirunaranan said those wanting to visit these locations should carry binoculars as they may not be able get a closer view of the birds. Tele lenses are required to photograph the birds. “Both the locations are not photographer’s delight,” he said. When compared to Pallikaranai marshland or the Perumbakkam wetlands, the water bodies at Nemmeli and Thaiyur are bigger in terms of size and water spread area, said forest officials. The ducks start their return migration from February-end and March. They use the Pallikaranai marshland as a stopover at that time. In between, they also visit the Kovalam creek.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/thaiyur-lake-nemmeli-wetland-new-birding-spots/articleshow/89144336.cms||P Oppili

Officials are planning to complete the works and commission all the 31 STPs by October this year. Senior officials have taken special care while preparing the blueprints of the newly-proposed STPs, sources said, ruling out acquisition of defence land, railway land or other central government land. Keeping in view of the previous experience of Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) during land acquisition while constructing the STPs in the city, extra care was taken this time, sources said. The state government itself faced several hurdles and its proposed infrastructure projects could not take off owing to non-clearance of defence land from the Centre. “Except in three to five places, we have enough land in remaining areas to set up the STPs,” HMWS&SB managing director M Dana Kishore told TOI.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/31-stps-to-come-up-on-litigation-free-land/articleshow/89144339.cms||Sunil Mungara
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Delay in shifting of polluting sponge iron units||HYDERABAD: Relocating sponge iron industries, which are causing pollution, from residential localities across the state will take more time, said the Telangana Industries and Commerce department. The department has filed an affidavit in the National Green Tribunal regarding the delay in shifting of sponge iron industries. The petition was filed by one Anirudh Reddy against Om Shiva Shakti Iron Industries Limited in Shadnagar of Mahabubnagar district. A total of eight sponge iron industries causing pollution were identified. Telangana State Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (TSIIC) has identified land parcels in Royapuram of Gadwal District, Chinnajatram and Kamasnapally of Narayanpet district. The sponge iron ore cluster is located in Kothur falls in Mahabubnagar district on the Bengaluru highway located 30 kilometres away from Hyderabad. Gundlapotlapally near Shadnagar has also several units.There are more such Shamshabad, Sangareddy and Nalgonda too. PCB had earlier issued notices to these units. During the land acquisition process, it was revealed that Royapuram is covered under a proposed lift irrigation project. A few more land parcels were identified at more than 12 locations in Mahaboobnagar district. The feasibility of the lands was examined and it was found that the land parcels are covered with hillocks and are not suitable for the establishment of sponge iron industries. Another land parcel is identified at Kamsanpally in Narayanpet district and is being considered to establish sponge iron units to an extent of about 238 acres. TSIIC has identified 299 acres at Navalga, Korviched and Masanpally of Baseerabad mandal. The sponge iron unit holders were taken to the sites with a view to relocate the sponge iron units. The process of assessing the suitability for sponge iron units is underway in consultation with the Telangana State Pollution Control Board, officials said. “It was difficult to locate land parcel to establish the industrial park with all required infrastructure. Sometimes land parcels are not suitable. Further, the land identified shall be at least 1 km away from habitations to comply with the CPCB norms. The resistance from local residents is also making it difficult to zero in on a location. However, all efforts are being made by the government to relocate the polluting industries,” said officials.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/delay-in-shifting-of-polluting-sponge-iron-units/articleshow/89144341.cms||---

The investigators have a grim reminder in the form of a similar fraud that occurred less than a year ago where the main African suspect could not be arrested and the lost amount of Rs 1.9 crore could not be recovered. Police identified that one of the current accounts whose original balance is a little over Rs 4,000 has been dormant. Cops identified a 70-year-old person and his younger associate as its users. Another accounts user, a woman, was identified to be in Mumbai and the account balance was about Rs 300. The third account holder’s phone is off. “All three accounts are from different branches of Mahesh Co-operative Bank and they have not been very active accounts,” said a police official. While police said that the hackers, who gained access to the bank’s server, have increased the balance amount in the three accounts before transferring it to 128 bank accounts across the country, bank’s deputy general manager Badrinath said that the fraudsters could not access the accounts of customers and the money was transferred to various accounts from the remittance transition funds of the bank by the fraudsters. “We have best of the cyber security appliances and we follow best security procedures. That’s why out servers were never affected before. We have hired an independent expert to identify how this has happened. We have insurance against cyber frauds,” Badrinath said. In a similar fraud in July 2021, cyber fraudsters siphoned off Rs 1.96 crore from Telangana State Co-operative Bank’s core bank account. Similar to the latest fraud, the accused initially moved the funds from the core account to three customer accounts and from there, transferred the amount to multiple bank accounts through IMPS channel. Police arrested Yaseen Basha and his brother Mohammed Rafi from Serilingampally. Based on their confession, a Nigerian, Daniel of Tolichowki, who asked them to open the bank accounts, was also arrested. However, a woman from Secunderabad, who opened another bank account, and another Nigerian, Wilson, on whose request Daniel asked others to open accounts, have not been arrested.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/cops-on-trail-of-3-a/c-holders-in-mahesh-bank-hacking/articleshow/89144351.cms||Mahesh Buddi

Many private hospitals have reported a surge in the number of Covid-19 affected people getting admitted to the hospital due to aggravated symptoms such as fever, dry cough and falling oxygen saturation levels over the last 10 days. The Delta variant was primarily responsible for the second wave between February and June 2021, resulting in large number of deaths. Doctors fear that even as the Omicron variant is resulting in the rise in number of cases, it is the Delta variant that is proving alarming for hospitals. As of January 26, as many as 38,023 Covid-19 patients are under treatment and isolation across Telangana. This figure stood at 22,197 on January 17. The number of people admitted in the hospital also increased from 2,366 about 10 days back to 3,332 on January 26. Dr K Prashant Kumar, consultant physician at Sunshine Hospitals, said, “The third wave started around January 1, but we have observed rise in hospitalisation over the last one week. People are landing up at the hospital with aggravated symptoms such as high-grade fever, breathlessness, saturation of 93-94%. In the RT-PCR test, if we find S gene then we clinically consider it as Delta variant.” Coronavirus live updatesDoctors said that the Delta variant is still prevalent, with many cases landing up in serious conditions at the hospitals. “Those with Delta are landing up at hospitals with elevated C-reactive protein, which is a marker of inflammation in the blood. Difference between previous wave and this wave is that people requiring oxygen is lower this time. Most of Delta patients are getting admitted for three to five days and recovering thereafter,” said Dr Naveen Reddy, consultant physician, Yashoda Hospital, Somajiguda.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/amid-omicron-delta-alarms-hospitals/articleshow/89144357.cms||Preeti Biswas

The pandemic posed a huge challenge to Karimnagar district two yeas ago when positive cases were first detected in March 2020 and the subsequent spike. Karimnagar had also reported first Tablighi Jammat cluster sparking a nationwide controversy. At the district collectorate, a cake was cut to mark the 100% vaccination. “Yes, I have shared the success story of Karimnagar with other district collectors. I am sure the 100% achievement can happen in all other districts too,” Karimnagar collector RV Karnan told TOI. Administering the vaccinations, especially among the rural folk, was quite a task. “There was stiff resistance. We had to devise a strategy to involve everyone in this mission,” Karnan said. Community leaders were taken into confidence. They were told they were the pivot. They played a crucial role in convincing people that taking the vaccine was safe. Women’s self-help groups, municipalities, both urban and rural, panchayat raj staff and local public representatives were all involved in the mission. Karnan and additional collector (local bodies) Garima Agarwal did not let the guard down as they visited PHCS, talked to families in colonies and individuals on the road and motivated them to take the vaccination. When it came to administering the second dose, every individual was reminded about it a day before and the jab was given.  Civil supplies minister Gangula Kamalakar was at hand to acknowledge the contributions made by the district administration in achieving the cent per cent inoculation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/knagar-journey-from-tablighi-row-to-100-vax/articleshow/89144359.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: As supply jumps, offices fall vacant||HYDERABAD: Already at a high 12% to 15%, the vacancy in Hyderabad’s office space could see a further jump — amid the third wave of Covid-19 — courtesy, a huge flow of new supply added to the sector recently. According to market data, new supply hit a record high of 11.7 million square feet (sft) in 2021 — the highest ever for the city and a 50% jump over 2020. In 2022, this is likely to peak reaching anywhere between 15 and 20 million sft, thus causing vacancy too to shoot up, say industry insiders. “But as vacancy rates inch up, it is important to note that the impact is not uniform across sub-markets. The highest addition to the vacant space is primarily coming from Gachibowli and emerging locations such as Kokapet, Nanakramguda,” suggest data compiled by real estate services firm, Cushman & Wakefield. Pre-pandemic, a dynamic absorption rate in Hyderabad always kept the vacancy levels limited to 4% to 8%. In fact, historical data shows that between 2016 and 2019 offices in Gachibowli had no more than 3% to 4% of vacancy as a healthy stream of IT/ITeS investors made their way into the western corridor. This has changed only in the last two years. “Office markets were to revive at the end of last year. Though Omicron seems to have deferred, it should stabilise when work-from-office resumes,” said Samson Arthur, branch director (Hyderabad), Knight Frank India. Agrees, Veera Babu, managing director, Hyderabad and East India of Cushman & Wakefield. “Despite some concerns optimism prevails and the outlook remains bright on the back of robust fundamentals and investment attractiveness. We can expect the office market to rebound in 2022-23 and will be more robust as witnessed post second wave,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/as-supply-jumps-offices-fall-vacant/articleshow/89144362.cms||Sudipta Sengupta

Serpentine queues are being seen at all Basti Dawakhanas, UPHCs, area and district hospitals. “On a daily basis, there are more than 900 to 1,000 people visiting government hospitals. Most of them are showing Covid-19 symptoms and have to undergo tests, increasing the load. Many of our staff members are also down with the infection. However, we are trying to deal with as many cases as we can,” said K Shankar, superintendent of Fever Hospital. Testing at private diagnostic centres costs anywhere between 500 to 1,500. Due to delayed results, self-testing rapid antigen kits are being preferred by many people.

Hamid Ali Khan, better known by his screen name Ajit, was born on January 27, 1922, in Golconda in Hyderabad. He was perhaps the first actor from Hyderabad to reign Bollywood as its favourite villain, usually as a refined and soft-spoken boss with powerful one-liners. Few other actors are remembered like Ajit for his dialogue delivery in that famous baritone. Deccan Heritage Trust managing trustee and historian Dr Mohammad Safiullah has formed a centenary celebrations committee with Shahid Ali Khan, son of the legendary actor, Jayesh Ranjan, senior IAS officer, M Veda Kumar of Deccan Heritage Academy and Zakir Hussain, educationist. The celebrations will begin after offering prayers at his grave at Jamali Kunta graveyard near Golconda between 12.30 pm and 1.30 pm on Thursday. Dr Safiullah demanded that a prominent road in the city be named after the actor. The actor’s son Shahid Ali told TOI that ‘Ajit the Lion, a biography’, has also been published to mark the birth centenary. “It is an exciting story that reveals several aspects of Ajit’s life that are not generally known to his fans. It also gives an insight into how a middle-class boy from Hyderabad attained success by overcoming several hurdles and hardships in life with perseverance, dedication and commitment,” he said. Zakir Hussain said Ajit’s dialogues are memorable across generations and they are widely repeated even now. “Smart Boy, Mona Darling, Sara Shaher Mujhe Lion Ke Naam Se Jaanta Hai, Michael, tum cycle par jao are some of the unforgettable dialogues in Bollywood history,” he said, adding that Ajit may have passed away on October 22, 1998, but his characters continues to inspire one and all. Dr Safi said after his early education in Hyderabad and Warangal, Ajit went to Bombay (Mumbai) in the early 1940s to pursue a career in acting. He got a break in 1946 as a hero in the film Shah-e-Misr. He had acted in around 200 films including the popular Nastik, Halaku, Guest House, Mughal-e-Azam, Naya Daur, Anand Mutt and Bada Bhai. He switched to villain roles with the film Suraj and never looked back with his unparalleled performances in Zanjeer, Kalicharan, Yaadon ki Baaraat, Ram Balram, Dharma and Barood.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/lion-of-villains-ajits-birth-centenary-today/articleshow/89144367.cms||Syed Akbar

While the total gross office space absorption in the top seven cities rose 8% to 39.61 million square feet in 2021 from 36.75 million square feet in 2020, Hyderabad along with Bengaluru and Delhi NCR accounted for 64% of the total office absorption. While Bengaluru accounted for 28% of absorption in the key markets with 11.1msft, followed by Delhi with 7.3msft and Hyderabad with 6.96msft. However, on the new office space completions front, Bengaluru and Hyderabad, together, accounted for over half the amount of office space becoming operational during 2021. While the top seven cities clocked a 20% jump in completions to 39.25msft in 2021 from 32.6 msft in 2020, Bengaluru showed completions of 10.7msft and Hyderabad 9.9msft in 2021 which translates to over 20msft. The report also pointed out that though Hyderabad recorded an 8% rise in gross office space absorption in 6.96msft in 2021 as compared to 2020, it was still a long way off from the absorption observed during the pre-pandemic period of 2019 with a lag of a steep 40%. “Given the tight situation around the office market, with most IT/ITeS companies deferring their return-to-office plans, Hyderabad’s share of office absorption dipped to 17.6% in 2021, leading it to occupy the third rank amongst the seven key office markets in the country, from its second position last year,” the report pointed out.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/hyd-bengaluru-lead-the-way-in-office-completions-vestian/articleshow/89144368.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

While TPCC president A Revanth Reddy announced that he would be contesting from Kodangal assembly constituency, sources said BJP state president and lawmaker Bandi Sanjay may contest from Karimnagar assembly segment. In the 2023 assembly elections. Revanth, who represents Malkajgiri Lok Sabha now, earlier represented Kodangal in Mahbubnagar district. Union minister G Kishan Reddy may also take the plunge from his earlier assembly constituency, Amberpet. Similarly, Nalgonda MP N Uttam Kumar from Huzurnagar, Bhuvangagiri MP Komatireddy Venkat Reddy might contest from either Bhongiri assembly or Nalgonda assembly. Nizamabad MP Dharmapuri Arvind from Armoor and former TRS MP B Vinod Kumar is looking to contest from Huzurabad. Other BJP leaders like Jithender Reddy and DK Aruna are reportedly wanting to try their luck in the next assembly elections. “Many leaders especially from opposition parties such as BJP and Congress are showing interest in assembly elections, because if their party comes into power there are chances of them becoming a minister. For big leaders and party local chiefs, they can also become chief ministerial candidate if the party come into power,” a senior political leader said. Analysts say if they lose in the assembly elections, the sitting MPs can seek ticket in Lok Sabha elections as sitting MPs. Interestingly some leaders are announcing their willingness to contest in the assembly polls without consulting or getting nod from their central leadership. Nizamabad MP and BJP leader Arvind announced that he would contest from Armoor against TRS MLA A Jeevan Reddy on Tuesday.  “But I would abide by decision of the party leadership on contesting assembly elections. Secondly I have not made up my mind whether to contest in assembly elections.” TPCC former president and MP Uttam Kumar Reddy told TOI. In the 2018 polls, some leaders such as Bandi Sanjay contested from Karimnagar assembly segment and lost. Subsequently, he emerged victorious from Karimnagar Lok Sabha seat in 2019. Congress MPs Komatireddy Venkat Reddy, N Uttam Kumar Reddy and union minister G Kishan Reddy were defeated by TRS candidates in 2018 but came back strongly to win in 2019 Parliamentary polls.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/sitting-mps-throw-their-hat-in-2023-assembly-polls-ring/articleshow/89144369.cms||Koride Mahesh

Among them, 19 MLAs, two MLCs, three ZP chairpersons and three MPs were chosen to head the party units at the district level. TRS president K Chandrasekhar Rao announced the party presidents’ names on Wednesday. The state executive will also be announced soon. The district presidents were named ahead of K Chandrasekhar Rao’s district tours from the first week of February. Party sources said this is the first time that as many as 27 elected representatives were made party chiefs at the district level.  Three women — MP Maloth Kavitha (Mahabubabad), ZP chairperson Gandra Jyothi (Jayashankar Bhupalpally) and MLA Padma Devender Reddy (Medak) — got a chance to head the party units. Jubilee Hills MLA Maganti Gopinath has been made party chief for Hyderabad district. The party leadership took care in ensuring social and caste composition in the appointments of presidents. But, many senior leaders, who aspired for the party posts, are reportedly unhappy with the appointments. “The party president has taken a decision (on appointments) and no one should cross the party line. Those who work for the party will always get recognition,” minister and Karimnagar MLA Gangula Kamalakar said. Party sources said K Chandrasekhar Rao took the decision to appoint district party presidents to get the party prepared for the 2023 assembly elections.

On its part, the Centre said that it was facing severe crunch of senior officers to work at the government of India level and was compelled to go for amendment, the Telangana government retorted saying several states were also facing shortage of IAS officers. “Telangana government is facing severe scarcity of AIS officers, especially IAS and IPS cadre officers. We have about 70 to 80 officers less than the allocated cadre strength for the state,” former chief secretary of Telangana SK Joshi told TOI. Many officers opined that AIS officers from big states like Maharashtra, Telangana, AP, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu were not keen on going for central deputation. About half a dozen officers from Telangana are on deputation to the Centre now and some are retiring this year. “Generally, officers belonging to Delhi and Union territory cadre prefer to stay in Delhi on deputation because of medical facilities and children’s education, etc. Secondly, an officer belonging to the northern part of India and states located close to Delhi goes on Centre’s deputation as it would suit him or her,” a senior official, who worked on central deputation, explained. Another officer said the Centre was not allowing deputation for more than five years for certain officers though they want to continue deputation. An officer, who held a position in the IAS officers’ association, said to be at the additional secretary level at the Centre, one should have worked as a joint secretary. But many officers from states like Telangana and AP do not prefer to work as joint secretary in the GoI, he pointed out. In some exceptional cases, the Centre relaxes the norms. “To overcome the shortage of officers, the Centre can relax cooling-off norms on central deputation to retain them for longer periods as many of them would be willing to continue there,” former special chief secretary BP Acharya told TOI. He said the Centre should make empanelment easier and more transparent so as to allow more officers to offer their services and accede to job specific requests.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/ais-officers-from-t-ap-not-keen-on-central-deputation/articleshow/89144371.cms||Koride Mahesh

In fact, Nellore was also the first district to attain a similar milestone pertaining to the first dose. Continuing the trend, the district emerged as the first one to complete 100% first dose vaccination for the 15-18 age group. Five more districts, including Anantapur, Kurnool, Prakasam, Vizianagaram and West Godavari, also inoculated all the 100% eligible beneficiaries in the 15-18 age group with the first shot. Andhra Pradesh is expected to cover all the 24.4 lakh adolescents in the 15-18 age group in a day or two as the state has already jabbed 24.11 lakh people in this group. As per the data available with TOI, about 99% of the frontline respondents and healthcare workers have been fully immunised against the pandemic. The first dose coverage among the 45-plus age group has exceeded 110%, while more than a 100% of the population under this category have got both their shots. The state has now concentrated on the 18-45 age group to achieve 100% double dose coverage. Meanwhile, the precautionary doses are also being given at a rapid pace. About 6.5 lakh people have so far received the booster shots. In all, Andhra Pradesh administered 7.9 crore vaccine doses as of 5 pm on Wednesday. The state already achieved 100% first dose coverage. The second dose coverage touched the 90% mark on Wednesday. The vaccine hesitancy, which plagued the immunisation drive in the initial months, is largely absent now with people turning up in huge numbers for even precautionary doses. The increased vaccine coverage is also said to be one of the reasons for the somewhat milder cases emerging in the ongoing third wave. Covishield accounts for nearly 83% of the total doses given to the beneficiaries in the state, while Covaxin makes up for the remaining doses. Only some 63,000 doses of Sputnik-V have been given to the beneficiaries.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/nellore-1st-ap-dist-to-achieve-100-double-dose-coverage/articleshow/89144375.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Despite police efforts to make roads safe, over 1,300 people were killed in road accidents in NCAP in 2021. Roads under Vizag rural police claimed lives of 392 people (highest) in the NCAP region followed by Vizag city roads (364 lives) in 2021. Though the police claim the condition of roads is not the reason for the increase in fatalities, motorists blame bad roads with poor designs for the accidents. ADCP (traffic), Vizag city, Ch Adinarayana said most of the fatalities were reported on the NH-16 stretch. “We are chalking out plans to identify the accident-prone areas (black spots) with the support of other departments. We will also seek the suggestions of experts on road engineering works to reduce crashes and fatalities,” he added.  Increase in the number of two- wheelers and a lack of awareness about traffic norms are also a reason for the rising road accidents in NCAP. Some of the fatal mishaps were self accidents. However, there is need for some road engineering works to curb mishaps on the roads, said a senior police officer. Police say a majority of road accidents were reported during the wee hours and night hours. “There are some black spots on the roads and we need to identify more and study the reasons for accidents at these places. Most of the accidents are due to human error and rash driving. It is necessary for motorists to ride their bikes and cars safely and follow traffic norms. We appeal the motorists to wear helmets and seatbelts for safer journey,” said B Krishna Rao, Vizag rural police chief.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/drive-to-curb-black-spot-mishaps/articleshow/89144378.cms||Nalla.Babu

Spread in about six acres of land in the heart of the city, the plan is to develop the station as an integrated bus terminal for commercial development to monetise and generate revenue for the RTC. The other core objectives include providing more amenities to the passengers and to make best use of existing resources. Located very next to the national highway, the depot is in one of the prime commercial locations of the city. According to the RTC officials, the location comes with a huge potential for commercial development. Apart from the inter-city buses, several long-distance buses are being operated from the station. About 10,000 daily passengers utilise the services of the station. Many buses from other states like Odisha, Chhattisgarh and Telangana also arrive at the station. In fact, Maddilapalem is home to one of the busiest transport hubs in Visakhapatnam. The initial estimates for the development of this integrated bus terminal are pegged at more than ₹400 crore. Construction of a depot at Tagarapuvalasa is also part of the project. The APSRTC has recently floated an expression of interest for development of this project. According to the officials, the tenders will be opened in February. As per the project objectives, 40 bus bays have to be created apart from the 20 bays for idle parking. Amenities like dormitories, AC deluxe lounge, shopping area, passenger waiting area, etc. will be added. The bus station will be combined with permitted commercial development to make the project commercially viable. A substantial part of the project will be dedicated to purely commercial activities like hotels, malls, offices, commercial complexes, recreational zones, social infrastructure, etc. as per the vision of developer on PPP basis. The prospective developer has recoup investments mainly through leasing rentals from commercial as well as bus terminal area, private parking spaces, advertising, etc. The project will have concession period of around 49 years (including construction period).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/rtc-plans-integrated-bus-terminal-at-maddilapalem/articleshow/89144380.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

The discoms substituted costly thermal power with cost-effective market purchases, and were able to reduce per unit power purchase cost by 0.16 when compared to the approved cost in the last fiscal. Of the 4,925 crore, 3,373 crore has already been passed on to the consumers in the form of true-down charges. Speaking on the occasion of 73rd Republic Day celebrations at Vidyut Soudha on Wednesday, state energy secretary Srikant Nagulapalli said the implementation of Navaratnalu in the power sector is a top priority of the government. “Millions of families will benefit from these schemes. The scheme of providing nine-hours of free power to agriculture during the daytime is one of the most important schemes. There are currently about 18.5 lakh agricultural connections in the state. These are being supplied with free power for nine hours a day through 6,663 feeders. The government is providing a subsidy of 7,714 crore for the free electricity scheme for agriculture,” said Srikant. “About 7,000 MW of solar power will be procured from the Union government’s Solar Energy Corporation of India from 2024. It will be supplied to 18.5 lakh farmers in the state through a special agricultural discom. It will help provide nine hours of power supply for the next 25 years without any financial burden on the existing discoms,” said Srikant. The AP power utilities have developed the day ahead electricity forecasting model to predict electricity demand in the state a day in advance. This is the first system in the country to work with artificial intelligence technology. This allows them to make accurate decisions on issues such as power supply and grid maintenance. Predicting energy demand helps prepare for the purchase or sale of electricity according to requirements.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/power-purchases-help-discoms-save-funds/articleshow/89144381.cms||---

He told reporters here that there is no internal disturbance in the party which is being organised under collective leadership. Reacting to BJP leader Ramesh Jarakiholi’s assertion that a few Congress leaders are in touch with him and are ready to join BJP, the former MP said Jarkiholi must concentrate on the disappointment that has erupted in BJP over the appointment of district ministers. “Jarkiholi was not invited to the meeting held by BJP leaders at Umesh Katti’s residence. BJP is struggling with internal fights. Let BJP leaders resolve their problems first before making false statements about Congress,” he said. On Tuesday, former chief minister and Congress leader in the assembly Siddaramaiah had said in Badami that legislators in BJP and JD(S) are in touch with him.On the reappointment of housing minister V Somanna as Chamarajanagar district minister, Dhruvanarayana said the BJP government has completely neglected the district.

BJP leader Renukacharya recently participated in a big fair in his constituency. On Tuesday, there was a huge fair in Chamarajanagar which was attended by Somanna.

---||Vijayawada||Krishna RTC offers 20% fare cut in AC buses to Hyd, Bengaluru||Vijayawada: After having bumper revenues during the Sankranti season, the Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC) is now offering discounts on ticket prices. However, the discount is not uniform across the state as only Krishna region has introduced the offer in premium bus services. A 20 per cent discount on ticket price is being offered in all AC buses to Hyderabad and Bengaluru.As the demand is muted after festive season, the state-run transport corporation introduced the discount scheme for the first time. Though the APSRTC is offering bus services at much cheaper prices during the peak season like Sankranti even after collecting 50 per cent more in special services when compared to private travels, it is struggling to match the ticket prices of private travels during the off peak season.The private travels which offer bus services mostly in premium range are reducing ticket prices as per the demand. As most of the tickets for the premium range buses used to be booked on ticket reservation apps, APSRTC is lagging behind the private operators during off peak seasons. The private operators are grabbing most of the traffic with aggressive marketing techniques by offering huge discounts. The regional manager of APSRTC for Krishna, M Yesu Danam introduced the discount scheme to compete with the private operators. The tickets in all premium services like Garuda, Indra, Amaravati, Vennela Sleeper, Night Rider and Garuda Plus are being offered at 20 per cent discount except on Sundays. The discount prices will be in force till the end of February which is considered as the lean period. This discount is applicable in buses running between Vijayawada and Bengalurur and the buses running to Hyderabad from Vijayawada, Machilipatnam, Auto Nagar and Gudivada.Speaking to TOI, Yesu Danam said there exists a provision for regional managers to offer discounts up to 20 per cent.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/krishna-rtc-offers-20-fare-cut-in-ac-buses-to-hyd-bengaluru/articleshow/89144398.cms||---

A week ago, the positivity rate was around the 11.2%. In the past seven days, the district has reported 7,882 Covid cases, but a steady discharge of patients has pushed the active caseload in Dharwad to the less alarming figure of 5,069, as on Wednesday.Members of the Dharwad district health task force have warned people that the curve is likely to rise further, given that the transmission of the virus was reaching its peak. However, they also believe that, by the end of the first week of February, the third wave of Covid-19 is likely to start rolling back.Dharwad district minister Halappa Achar on Wednesday chaired a meeting to review the situation, with deputy commissioner Nitesh Patil among those in attendance. “We tested 38,603 people in the past one week, and 7,882 have tested positive for the novel coronavirus. Nearly 97% of those infected with Covid are quarantined at home, to whom we are distributing medicine kits at their doorstep. We have also arranged for these patients to consult doctors via telemedicine facility,” Patil said.He added that the district administration had made necessary arrangements to treat Covid patients at Karnataka Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS), Hubballi, which could accommodate up to 1,400 patients. “Since people from neighbouring districts visit KIMS as well, we have upgraded the infrastructure to accommodate 2,400 patients,” the DC said.Patil said that, while there was no dearth of experts at KIMS, the hospital was facing a shortage of Group ‘D’ employees. “We have submitted a proposal to the medical education minister, requesting permission to recruit necessary staff, and we have received in-principle approval. We are awaiting the finance department’s nod to commence the process,” Patil said. Lauding the doctors for working long hours, Achar said “The state is in the midst of the third wave of Covid-19, and cases are surging. The doctors must rise to the occasion again, and save patients’ lives.” The minister assured the district administration of discussing the shortage of staff at KIMS with the rest of the cabinet.Achar asked the medical fraternity to lean on the experience it had garnered during the first two iterations of the pandemic to ensure that hospitals did not want for liquid medical oxygen, and other vital medicines.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/positivity-rate-in-dharwad-surges-to-23/articleshow/89144407.cms||---

An experiment is being done and it has no link with forthcoming elections also.” Reacting to Congress leaders’ remarks about BJP leaders joining the Congress, Shettar said that nobody from BJP will go to Congress, and those who do so are foolish. “If Siddaramaiah and DK Shivakumar have courage and they speak truth, let them reveal the names of BJP leaders joining the Congress. Congressmen are coming to the BJP,” he said. “Congress will be whitewashed after the assembly polls in five states, and one will need binoculars to look for it,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/shettar-bats-for-local-dist-ministers/articleshow/89144408.cms||---

Ramesh is a powerful politician, and can help the BJP gain 16 MLAs,” Karjol said.Pointing out that not much must be read into the meeting between BJP MLAs and KPCC president DK Shivakumar at the airport in Bengaluru, Karjol added, “Such encounters are common when one is travelling. There was nothing political about that meeting.”Admitting that many leaders in the party were demanding a decision on the reshuffle of the cabinet, Karjol said that chief minister Basavaraj Bommai would have the last word on the exercise.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/ramesh-can-help-bjp-gain-16-mlas-karjol/articleshow/89144409.cms||---

Triaging for management of Covid-19 cases has helped hospitals stay decongested for care of only those who desperately need it.Till Wednesday, a total of 11,425 new Covid-19 cases have been reported in Madurai district in January. During the same period, 6,570 recoveries have also been recorded. In the previous waves of Covid-19, such surge in cases had led to a rush for hospital beds, but this time only less than 10% of patients have required hospitalizations and the rest needing only home quarantine, monitored by a doctor. “Those requiring even oxygen is very less considering the high number of Covid-19 cases reported in the past month. Covid-19 patients must get admitted to a hospital only based on the doctors’ advice. By avoiding unnecessary admissions, hospitals have also been able to remain decongested and focus more on care of the most vulnerable,” said a senior general physician. Within Madurai city where comparatively more Covid-19 cases are reported, four triaging centres are functional for Covid-19 patients where patients will be triaged and sent to a hospital, Covid-19 care centre or for home isolation, depending on the severity.Fatalities due to Covid-19 have also been very minimal over the past month and almost all the deceased were those with co-morbid conditions. In January, a total of only 19 Covid-19 deaths were reported in Madurai in both government and private hospitals. “Vaccination has also played a major role in keeping severity and mortality in check and we are working towards having more people, especially vulnerable groups like senior citizens, get vaccinated.

---||Madurai||3 years after PM Modi laid stone, AIIMS Madurai still remains on paper||MADURAI: Thursday marks three years since Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for the All Indian Institute of Medical Sciences in Madurai with much fanfare, but no construction has taken place at the site yet. Though it was stipulated to be completed in 45 months, work is expected to start only next year. When the announcement for the premier medical institution was made about seven years ago, it was seen as a flagship scheme that would bring in votes for BJP and its allies in the Lok Sabha polls scheduled for 2019. It was the then finance minister Arun Jaitley who announced the project in February 2015 bringing much joy to the people of Tamil Nadu. However, delays had bogged down the project ever since. It was announced in August 2020 that construction would start after the agreement was signed with Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) in December that year. But the agreement dragged on till March 2021. Then arose the controversy of the then AIADMK government not handing over the land required for the construction to the Union government. A case in this regard was filed in the Madurai bench of Madras high court and the state government informed that it had handed over the land on November 3. However, nine months after signing the agreement with JICA, the project continues to be on paper. The shocker came after the administrative meeting of Madurai AIIMS in June when it was announced that construction would begin only in 2023 and be completed in 2026, four years beyond its initially scheduled completion in September 2022. RTI activist Pandiaraja points out that all AIIMS facilities announced after the one for Madurai have come into existence and student enrolments have also begun. When the PM laid the foundation stone, the project estimate was Rs 1,264 crore, which was revised to Rs 2,000 crore in December 2020. Virudhunagar MP Manickam Tagore, member of the Madurai AIIMS general council, says the problem lies in the project’s funding 82% of which is by JICA and only the remaining by Government of India. In contrast, the AIIMS facilities announced along with Madurai were funded by GOI. The Japanese government, already impacted by Covid and the Olympics, would take time for its planning and execution. The 50 students of Madurai AIIMs would be admitted to Ramanathapuram Government Medical College. ``JICA would complete it by 2026, but the first batch of students of AIIMS Madurai would graduate without entering the building,’’ he said. Coordinator of AIIMS for Madurai Movement, V S Manimaran, says that since JICA was to provide Rs 1,627 crore, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman should at least announce the Union government’s contribution of Rs 200 crore in the ensuing budget.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/3-yrs-after-pm-laid-stone-aiims-madurai-still-remains-on-paper/articleshow/89144420.cms||---

Efforts are on to capture the big cat, which is believed to have entered Pongupalayam village in Perumanallur of Tirupur from the Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve or Pethikuttai reserve forest of Sirumugai forest range on Tuesday night. A leopard had attacked two farm labourers and an anti-poaching watcher at a maize field at Pappankulam village of Avinashi in Tirupur on Monday. The forest department placed a net around the field, but the staff were not able to spot the animal again. After the leopard was spotted in Pongupalayam village, forest department officials visited the place and conducted a search operation. “We found some pugmarks and droppings in an agricultural field. The pugmarks could be at least a month old. However, we can confirm that it was of a leopard,” said A Sukumar, veterinarian of Coimbatore forest division.

---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore district records steady decline in daily Covid cases||COIMBATORE: In a relief to health workers and the public, daily Covid cases in Coimbatore has been recording a steady decline over the past few days. In all probability, Coimbatore could have hit the peak and the spread is expected to subside further in the coming days, similar to the pattern seen in Chennai. According to the health bulletin issued by the state government, Coimbatore reported 3,740 fresh cases on Wednesday, a fall from 3,763 cases recorded the previous day. Though the drop in fresh cases was only marginal, it indicated the trend of falling number of cases since Sunday. On January 23, the district recorded 3,912 cases, the highest single day tally in the current wave of Covid spread. Since then, the number of cases has been declining. However, the number of active cases has been on the rise. While there were 22,921 people undergoing treatment for Covid in January 23, the number rose to 27,037 people on Wednesday. This was because the number of people declared as recovered on daily basis has been lesser than those infected. “Those people who got infected a week or 10 days back or getting recovered now. Since the number of people infected 10 days back was lesser, the number of recovered also remains lesser,” a health officer said. On Wednesday, 2,884 people recovered, according to the bulletin. Fatality has also remained stagnant at two deaths per day. The bulletin said that a 84-year-old male admitted on January 19 and a 70-year-old male admitted on January 24 died. The worrying factor, however, is the positivity rate. Coimbatore continues to top the state in positivity rate at 27.5 %, way ahead of other high prevalence districts like Chennai and Chengalpet. Neighbouring Tirupur district however had a different trend of spike in daily Covid cases coupled with a high positivity rate. While the district had reported only 1,490 cases on Tuesday, it rose to 1,787 cases on Wednesday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/district-records-steady-decline-in-daily-cases/articleshow/89144427.cms||---

---||Delhi||DDMA to decide on reopening of schools in Delhi today||NEW DELHI: The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), which will hold a crucial meeting on Thursday to review restrictions in the capital, might consider reopening of schools in a phased manner from the first week of February, sources said. Amid a decline in the number of Covid-19 cases and positivity rate and a growing demand from traders to open all shops and restaurants, the DDMA, chaired by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, could also consider lifting the weekend and night curfews, doing away with the odd-even rule for markets and allowing gyms, spas and restaurants to operate again. Sources said Delhi government has asked all schools to finish administering the first dose of the Covid vaccine to those eligible in the 15-17 age group by January 31. According to officials, 85% of eligible children in government schools and 50% of eligible private school students have got their first shots. “Schools have also been told to personally contact the students and their families through phone calls or home visits and convince them to take the vaccine in the next few days,” an official said, requesting anonymity. “The elected government is going to propose reopening of schools in a phased manner, with classes 9 to 12 starting offline from February 1,” the official added. Quoting various researches done by global institutions, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Wednesday said that the risk of Covid-19 was less among young children and reopening of schools was necessary to prevent further damage to socio-emotional well-being of students. According to the agenda of the DDMA meeting, the health and family welfare department will make a presentation on the situation and preparation in the wake of the rise in cases due to the Omicron variant. DDMA will review the status of the precautionary dose vaccination of health and frontline workers and senior citizens with comorbidities. It is also expected to review the vaccination status of children and the implementation of Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP). Officials said the 10-member DDMA, with the lieutenant governor as its chairman, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal as vice-chairman and comprising revenue minister, chief secretary and top bureaucrats, may take a considerate view towards relaxing most of the curbs, as the test positivity rate has come down to almost 10.5% and the number of cases has been consistently below 10,000 over the past few days. Responding to a proposal sent by Delhi government on January 21, LG Baijal had allowed the reopening of private offices with 50% attendance but refused to lift the weekend curfew and remove the odd-even system of opening of shops during weekdays. He had asked the elected dispensation to maintain status quo since the positivity rate was still hovering above 21% and more than 12,000 Covid cases were being recorded daily. “In the past six or seven days, the positivity rate has dropped to almost half. The restrictions have been badly affecting the economy and severely impacting the poor. There’s a strong possibility that most restrictions would go now,” said an official, requesting anonymity. Niti Aayog member V K Paul, AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria, ICMR director-general Balram Bhargava and deputy CM Manish Sisodia are among 12 special invitees to the DDMA meeting.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/phased-reopening-of-schools-on-cards/articleshow/89143388.cms||Atul Mathur
---||Delhi||Delhi deputy CM Manish Sisodia fears a generation of kids may be left behind||NEW DELHI: A generation of children will be left behind if schools in the capital continue to remain closed, deputy CM and education minister Manish Sisodia said on Wednesday. The remarks, tweeted by the minister, came after a delegation representing more than 1,600 parents submitted a petition urging him to reopen schools as their closure is “affecting not only studies, but also the mental and emotional well-being of children”. The delegation was led by policy experts Chandrakant Lahariya and Yamini Aiyar. Sisodia said he agreed with the parents that continued closure had resulted in a huge learning gap. “In the past two years, children have been confined to their rooms. Instead of spending time on the playground, all their activities now take place on mobile phones. When the pandemic began, our priority was children’s safety. But since research has shown Covid may not be harmful for kids, it is important to reopen schools, especially in time for exams,” he said. Later, Sisodia tweeted: “We closed schools when it was not safe for children but excessive caution is now harming our children. A generation of children will be left behind if we do not open our schools now.” Delhi government will recommend reopening schools to DDMA, which will meet on Thursday. According to Dr Lahariya, various studies showed risks associated with Covid are less among kids. “School closure has a few advantages but its negative impact on learning and emotional well-being is very high,” he said. The memorandum submitted by parents said, “According to World Bank, learning poverty in India is expected to increase from 55% to 70% due to learning loss and more out-of-school children. For younger children, long-term denial of social play is causing isolation and serious developmental issues.” It added that experts have concluded that younger kids are at a “very low risk” of severe or fatal Covid-19. Several other parents TOI spoke to stressed on the need to reopen schools. Devasish Tewary, whose daughter is a Class 11 student at Srijan School in Model Town, suggested the government could open schools in a staggered manner. “It can be done in two phases – first for classes 6 to 12 and after a fortnight for other classes. Since the vaccination drive is being undertaken actively and other activities have restarted with no severe adverse results, education must be brought back to normal too,” he said. Some parents also urged reopening of higher education institutions. “The digital divide between the rich and the poor is massive and the majority of students have been deprived of education. There is no substitute for physical classes. The personalities of students undergo a sea change when they meet their peers. At home, they don’t know what sports or live debate or co-curricular activity is,” said DS Rana, member of All India Parents’ Association.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/sisodia-fears-a-generation-of-kids-may-be-left-behind/articleshow/89143396.cms||Shradha Chettri

Police said the men would hand over the stolen goods to cybercrooks in Jamtara who used these phones for cheating people. Investigators claimed that they have recovered 40 mobile phones they had stolen in the past five days. Police identified the accused as Ram Darshan, Sekhar Kumar, Bijay Kumar, Aman Kumar and Vikas Kumar Sahu. All of them are natives of Jharkhand. “Two accused Ram Darshan and Bijay were arrested near INA bus stand whereas other accused were nabbed near Sewa Nagar vegetable market,” said deputy commissioner of police (south) Benita Mary Jaiker. They called themselves Naya Tola gang. “Naya Tola is an area in Jharkhand. They used to come to Delhi by train and after committing crimes, they returned home via train as well,” an officer said. The arrests were made by a team led by SHO (Kotla) Vinay Tyagi. Police said they rented accommodation in the city for 10-15 days or a month. As per their plan, they visited crowded places and pickpocketed phones. “We learnt that they visited malls, bus stops and busy markets like Sarojini Nagar, INA, Saket, Mehrauli, Paharganj, Lajpat Nagar, Laxmi Nagar and Mandawali to commit crimes,” the officer said. The officer added that the phones were sold for cheap to a man who further sold the goods to other crooks in Jamtara. “If a phone costs Rs 40,000 then they will sell it for Rs 10,000,” the officer said. The investigation has also revealed that one of the accused Ram Darshan was arrested in 2017. “We suspect that they were involved in such crimes before 2017 too,” the officer said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/crooks-stole-phones-sold-them-to-gang-in-jamtara/articleshow/89143402.cms||---

Dr Rufino Monteiro, IMA, Goa, president, who was part of the panel discussion, said though the third wave appears to be less severe, the infection can’t be taken lightly, as people have been dying due to it. On Thursday, Goa reported 15 covid deaths, its highest-single day count of the third wave so far. The number has been even higher than the single-day tally recorded during the first wave. On September 14, 2020, 14 had died in a single day due to Covid. The trend of patients being brought dead to hospitals has continued even during the third wave even as health services have been continually appealing to people not to delay in getting tested and to see a doctor if fever continues after three days. People having comorbidities are advised to be more careful and not to ignore the symptoms. Goa has seen fewer hospitalisations in the third wave as compared to the first and the second waves. Since the start of the third wave on December 28, 636 patients were required to be hospitalised as against 16,033 and 13,936 in the first and second waves respectively.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/in-third-wave-53-of-covid-fatalities-not-vaccinated/articleshow/89166737.cms||---

The National Board of Examinations in Medical Sciences, the apex body to hold the NEET PG entrance exam, announced it will be held on March 12. The eligibility criteria require candidates who have completed a year of internship or are likely to finish it before May 31. This has raised concern among students aspiring to sit for the exam as many of them couldn’t complete the internship due to compulsory Covid duties from April last year. The resident doctor's association of the Centre-run Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital has written to the NBE requesting to revise the eligibility criteria for students undergoing internships. The RDA also mentioned that many of the students had delayed joining of internship due to personal health as well as issues like loss of family members during the wave. “Due to these reasons, it is impossible that many candidates will complete the internship by May 31, thus making them ineligible to sit for the NEET PG 2022 and eventually leading to wastage of entire year. Thus as per the existing criteria, thousands of students across the nation will be deprived of the opportunity without any fault on their part,” read the letter.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/why-medical-pg-aspirants-are-fretting-at-entrance-tests/articleshow/89143427.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana directs DCPs to focus on solving pending cases of burglaries||NEW DELHI: Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana has directed DCPs to focus on solving pending cases of burglaries. The senior officers have also been asked to conduct an analysis of street crimes and submit a report. The directions come in the wake of concerns raised by several residents over break-ins. Last year, the RWA of the railway colony at Chanakyapuri had written a letter to Delhi Police about thefts in their area. Similarly, the RWA of GK-1 (S block) had held a meeting with local police informing them about burglaries in their society and asked them to increase patrolling. Asthana held a meeting with DCPs in this regard. “DCPs should visit the crime scene and ensure vital evidence is collected by the investigating officers,” he said. DCPs were asked to focus on not only making arrests, but also on recovering the stolen goods and handing them over to the owners. Till November 11 last year, 2,125 burglaries were reported in the city. Of these, 976 cases were solved and a total of 1,444 arrests were made. Police said there were fewer burglaries in 2020 (the year saw 2,199 cases) compared to 2019 due to the lockdown, but there was an uptick after the curbs were lifted. According to police, while the summer sees a higher number of daytime burglaries, break-ins at night are reported more often in the winter. “The winter days are shorter and nights are darker, which gives burglars good cover. Visibility is also low and movement of people reduces due to cold, so burglars often go undetected,” an officer said. Police said burglars often roam around in search of locked houses. “They gather information by doing a recce and once it is confirmed that no one is staying in the house, they break it open,” said a cop. Many times, thieves monitor houses that have newspapers or other items lying outside the front door to see if they can target them, according to police. “In the summer, burglars keep tabs on the sound of fans or ACs which tells them someone is present inside. They avoid targeting such homes,” another officer said. While burglars sometimes use equipment like modified iron rods to break open the lock, in other cases they use a duplicate key or jump through the window, police said, adding they take 15-20 minutes to steal cash and jewellery, rarely taking any other items. CCTV plays an important role in the investigation, an officer said. “We also collect fingerprints from the spot and check dossiers to segregate criminals who might be involved. We zoom in on the suspects through technical surveillance and manual work,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/solving-pending-burglary-cases-put-on-priority-/articleshow/89143444.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Delhi||Delhi: e-FIR app for thefts to cut personal visits||NEW DELHI: In case of a house theft or burglary, Delhiites will now be able to get their FIR lodged without running from pillar to post. Delhi Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana on Wednesday launched an e-FIR app that will enable people to instantly lodge complaints about incidents like house theft and burglary. The new app allows one to file a complaint from anywhere at any time. Senior police officers said this would help cops quickly solve such cases. Special commissioner of police (crime) Devesh Chandra Srivastva said after a person registers a complaint, an FIR will be lodged at an e-police station established under the crime branch. “The app has the facility of instantly sending a copy of the digitally signed FIR to the email ID of the complainant, the area SHO concerned, senior officers and to the designated court. It will also guide investigating officers (IOs) to complete investigation and documentation along with management information system for analysis and take preventive measures,” Srivastva said. The officer said that immediate reporting of these cases would also help the investigating officers complete their probe and documentation in time, which will reduce pendency at police stations and courts. The IOs will have to update the complainant about the progress in the case from time to time, Srivastva said. Police said that the application developed for lodging FIRs in theft cases shall be hosted at a technically suitable place for its smooth functioning while the web application URL shall have a link with the official website of Delhi Police www.delhipolice.nic.in. The application can be found under the ‘Citizen Services’ section of the website. The first-time users will have to register by providing a mobile phone number and an email ID. A one-time-password (OTP) shall be received by the user on mobile and web through SMS and email, respectively. The assigned IO will also get a system-generated OTP for accessing each FIR folder every time, police said. The best feature of the application is that it enables the IO to contact the complainant within 24 hours. “Without any delay, he/she can obtain signatures on the printout copy of FIR, visit the crime scene and if required call for forensic help. He will also inform senior officers, conduct inquiry, prepare a site plan, record statements of complainant and witness, collect evidence, make efforts to identify the culprit and trace the stolen property,” the officer added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/-e-fir-app-for-thefts-to-cut-personal-visits/articleshow/89143456.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Eyeing fresh tickets, councillors hardsell their 5-year report cards||NEW DELHI: With many municipal wards declared as reserved for women or SC by the State Election Commission (SEC), councillors have started promoting their work through five-year report cards via various mediums. They have started this endeavour to get public support and increase their chances of getting a ticket from another ward. The seat of senior Congress councillor from Andrews Ganj and state vice-president Abhishek Dutt has now been reserved for women. He may have to move back to his Defence Colony ward, which he represented in his first term. To apprise people about the works done by him in the past two terms (nine years), Dutt has come out with a report card and has been circulating videos titled “Kaam kar dikhaya, har vada hai nibhaya”. “In many cases, I filed PILs to ensure that residents of my ward got the facilities they deserved. We approached the Delhi high court when the government or agencies turned a blind eye to get the work of a mall in Defence Colony stopped, begin construction of a dispensary, release salaries of sanitation workers, online pension to senior citizens and construct a foot overbridge,” said Dutt. Former mayor and councillor from Janakpuri (West) Narendra Chawla’s seat has been reserved for women candidates now. “While it will be the party’s decision to nominate me as a candidate, I have started sharing details of each work completed or promoted during my tenure with people through WhatsApp and other mediums. The Waste to Wonder Park was inaugurated when I was the mayor. Bharat Darshan was also conceived then. We worked hard to get land for new parking lots, establish fixed compacting stations, procure e-vehicles, etc,” said Chawla. The seats of the three mayors have now been reserved for women. The same case exists for the seats of the leader of the opposition in south and east corporations. North corporation’s ward 72, which belongs to AAP councillor and leader of the opposition Vikas Goel, has been reserved for SC. Goel was disappointed with the reservation as he claimed he had worked really hard in his ward and people wanted him to continue as the councillor. “I have no clue where I will contest from, but I will soon start meeting people and sharing the details of works done by me over the past five years. Mine was the first ward in north corporation that was made dhalao-free. We made provisions for swings in parks in jhuggi clusters, open gyms, LED lights, among other facilities,” he said. Delhi BJP president, former mayor and councillor from West Patel Nagar Adesh Gupta said the changes would barely impact their performance. “Ours is a cadre-based party where each worker contributes to it. Everyone is well-connected with people in their areas, which is why there is no dearth of candidates. There were concerns about declaring some wards as ‘general’ where the majority is SC population, but we welcome the SEC’s decision,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/eyeing-fresh-tickets-councillors-hardsell-their-5-year-report-cards/articleshow/89143061.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Delhi||Delhi: In Covid shadow, Republic marches on||NEW DELHI: Despite the morning chill and shadow of Covid-19, an enthusiastic crowd was seen at Rajpath to celebrate the 73rd Republic Day on Wednesday. It was the second consecutive year when Republic Day was celebrated in the shadow of a pandemic with no foreign dignitary as the chief guest. The day saw many firsts, which included the launch of the “Shaheedon Ko Shat Shat Naman” programme by National Cadet Corps, a grand flypast by 75 aircraft of Indian Air Force, cultural performances by 480 dancers selected through the nationwide Vande Bharatam competition, display of 10 scrolls each of 75 metres prepared during the “Kala Kumbh” event and installation of 10 large LED screens for a better viewing experience of spectators. The celebrations commenced with Prime Minister Narendra Modi paying homage to martyrs at National War Memorial. Continuing the trend of wearing headgear, Modi sported a cap from Uttarakhand and was draped in a stole from Manipur. Later, the unfurling of the national flag was followed by a 21-gun salute. The parade commenced with President Ram Nath Kovind taking the salute. Special arrangements were made this time and spectators were made to sit with strict social distancing and Covid booths were set up at all entrances. Only fully vaccinated adults were allowed, while children aged below 15 years were not permitted. Even the annual cultural programme by children was replaced by the performance of dancers. For a better viewing experience, five LED screens on each side of Rajpath were installed. The parade began at 10.30am to ensure better visibility of the parade and the flypast. Though there was no chief guest, special invitees included autorickshaw drivers, construction workers, sanitation and frontline health workers. The marching contingent displayed the evolution of uniforms and weapons of Indian Army over the last 75 years. The Jammu & Kashmir Light Regiment was in the uniform worn in 1971 and carried 7.62mm self loading rifles. The Assam Regiment was in uniform from 1962 and carried .303 rifles. There were 25 tableaux, including 12 from states and nine from different ministries or departments, two from DRDO and one each from Indian Air Force and Indian Navy. They were followed by a display by Seema Bhawani Motorcycle Team of BSF and Himveers of Indo-Tibetan Border Police, who stole the show with their daredevil stunts. The event concluded with the Amrit formation where 17 Jaguar aircraft made a figure of 75. After the national anthem, tricolour balloons were released in the air.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/in-covid-shadow-republic-marches-on/articleshow/89143049.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

Procession routes were decorated with yellow buntings. Veteran Congressman B Janardhana Poojari led the main procession that was carried out from Sri Brahma Baidarkala Garadi Kshetra in Kankanady to Lady Hill Circle. He joined the jatha at Lady Hill. Thousands of people took part in it and recited bhajans. A decorated tableau was part of the procession. VHP and Bajrang Dal activists erected a board naming Lady Hill Circle after Sri Narayan Guru. In another procession carried out by Brahmashri Narayana Guru Swabhimani Nadige Vedike, several people, including Congress leaders, took out a procession from Sri Brahma Baidarkala Garadi Kshetra in Kankanady, after offering puja at the temple. Speaking on the occasion, MLC K Harish Kumar said crores of the social reformer’s followers are pained by the rejection of his tableau. Hundreds of people took part in a procession carried out by the Left parties and various organisations from Clock Tower to the deputy commissioner’s office. Addressing the gathering, CPM district secretary K Yadav Shetty alleged that the Sangh Parivar does not show any respect towards Sri Narayana Guru, and that the rejection of his tableau is the manifestation of their intolerance towards him. The insult to the social reformer will cost the BJP dearly, he predicted. Many other leaders addressed the gathering. Earlier in the day, district minister V Sunil Kumar blamed the Congress and the Left parties for trying to reap political dividends out of the issue. He recalled naming Lady Hill Circle after Sri Narayan Guru.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/processions-with-sri-narayana-guru-tableau-taken-out-in-city/articleshow/89142380.cms||---
---||Delhi||Anguished at women invoking sexual harassment claims at the drop of a hat: Delhi HC||NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court has expressed anguish at women invoking sexual harassment allegations “at the drop of a hat” to register displeasure at the conduct of another person. This merely trivialises the offence of sexual harassment and harms women empowerment, it said. Justice Subramonium Prasad made the observation while quashing an FIR lodged against a Delhi University (DU) academic. The court said criminal proceedings needed to end in the case to prevent the abuse of the process. “This court expresses its anguish at how provisions such as Sections 354A/506 IPC are falsely invoked at the drop of a hat to register one’s displeasure at the conduct of another individual. This merely trivialises the offence of sexual harassment and casts a doubt on the veracity of the allegations filed by every other victim who has in reality faced sexual harassment, thereby setting back the cause of women empowerment,” it stated. The court said that the contents of the FIR were sketchy in nature without any specifics. It also took note of the police’s status report that the academic and his wife had filed multiple complaints against construction in the neighborhood and said that “it is evident that the FIR was maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the petitioner, and with a view to spite him and his wife due to a private and personal grudge.” The court agreed with the claim of the DU professor that the FIR was merely a counterblast and was solely registered to arm-twist the couple into withdrawing the complaints that had been filed against the neighbours. As per the petitioner, the FIR contains nothing but bald allegations and has been registered in connivance with the police as the daughter-in-law of the neighbour is a constable of Delhi Police. As per the complainant, when he returned from a vacation, a cemented water tank that he had constructed on his rooftop was demolished by a neighbour for constructing a room and toilet on the roof. Despite requests to repair the damage, the neighbours failed to do so and the petitioner installed a plastic water tank with his own money. However, he and his wife complained to DDA and other authorities about the illegal construction on the roof in response to which the neighbour alleged sexual harassment by the professor.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/hc-anguished-at-women-invoking-sexual-harassment-claims-at-the-drop-of-a-hat/articleshow/89143072.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: From rich heritage to regional diversity, tableaux have it all||NEW DELHI: From the struggle for Independence to biodiversity, the tableaux at the 73rd Republic Day parade not only displayed India’s rich cultural diversity, but also showcased development and the way forward to prosperity. Of the 25 tableaux, 21 were from states and departments while four were of DRDO, Navy and IAF. West Bengal and Tamil Nadu were excluded this year. CPWD’s tableau, dedicated to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose on his 125th birth anniversary, depicted the historical Moirang war and Indian National Army hoisting the Tricolour on Indian soil for the first time on April 14, 1944. CRPF’s tableau showed the 1965 defence of the Sardar post in Rann of Kutch against a Pakistani attack. Gujarat’s tableau depicted the 1922 revolution of the Bhil tribe against the British revenue system, in which 1,200 tribals were shot dead, according to officials. Arunachal Pradesh, too, displayed the native resistance and the successful attempt of the indigenous people to keep their land free of colonialism. The tableau, depicting the four wars of “Bitbor Mimak” in 1858, “Bongal Mimak” in 1859, “Nijom Mimak” in 1893-94 and “Poju Mimak” in 1911-12, showed Abor (Adi) warriors “defending the land from intruders”. With freedom fighter Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru’s idols at the front and a depiction of the protest by Lala Lajpat Rai against the Simon Commission in the rear, the Punjab tableau showed the struggle for independence. The J&K, Chhattisgarh and Meghalaya tableaux attempted to capture the idea of progress. While Meghalaya’s tableau depicted women leading cooperative societies, Chhattisgarh showcased its rural industrial parks. The highlights of the J&K tableau were the Banihal-Qazigund highway tunnel and the under-construction Chenab rail bridge. The theme of pilgrimage made its way to both the Uttarakhand and UP tableaux. While UP depicted the renovated Kashi Vishwanath Dham in Varanasi, Uttarakhand showcased Hemkund Saheb and Badrinath. Karnataka paid tribute to its traditional handicraft industry, mentioning the GI tag for 16 artefacts. Goa, which is marking 50 years of liberation, showcased the struggle with Martyr’s Memorial. Maharashtra boasted its biodiversity by depicting a giant squirrel, hariyal bird and blue mormon butterfly.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/from-rich-heritage-to-regional-diversity-tableaux-have-it-all/articleshow/89143071.cms||Kushagra Dixit
---||Delhi||Delhi: AAP alleges north corporation selling 2 hospital plots, BJP says claims baseless||NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party on Wednesday alleged that North Delhi Municipal Corporation was handing over two plots of land meant for hospitals to private players by bypassing the Delhi Municipal Act. Addressing a press conference, AAP MLAs Dilip Pandey and Vishesh Ravi alleged that the BJP-led north corporation had floated commercial tenders to sell the plots, which were acquired to build Jhandewalan Chest Clinic and Narela Dispensary Complex. However, this has been refuted by the saffron party. “No commercial tender has been floated by North Delhi Municipal Corporation to sell hospital land,” Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said. Pandey alleged that in a complete disregard to the law of the land, BJP bypassed the DMC Act 1957 to benefit the private mafia. “Karol Bagh’s Jhandewalan Chest Clinic and Narela’s Qutabgarh Dispensary Complex are being illegally given to private organisations. BJP will now make the poor pay for treatment at hospitals, which were earlier completely free,” the Timarpur MLA alleged. Ravi, the Karol Bagh MLA, claimed that BJP’s corrupt functionaries have forced the north corporation to give away both the hospitals for 20 years without charging any fees. The two AAP functionaries claimed that the land meant for Jhandewalan Chest Clinic measures 510 square metres while the plot for Qutabgarh Dispensary Complex in Narela Zone measures 4,000 square metres. They alleged that the proposal to sell the land was first brought up in the standing committee where AAP opposed it. “And now, without bringing the proposal in the House, tenders for the auctioning of these two properties have been issued,” Pandey alleged. Delhi BJP said there was no truth in the allegations levelled by the AAP functionaries. “There is one municipal dispensary building at Jhandewalan, which is closed due to the economic crunch. Now in public interest, the north corporation has invited the expression of interest from NGOs to maintain the building and run a free-for-all charitable dispensary,” Kapoor said. “The Narela dispensary was also built in 2015 but could not be started due to paucity of funds. Both buildings shall continue to remain municipal property in future too,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/aap-alleges-north-corpn-selling-2-hospital-plots-bjp-says-claims-baseless/articleshow/89143077.cms||---
---||Delhi||In perfect sync: Dancers step up to steal the show||NEW DELHI: Dressed as a coconut shell and wearing vibrant makeup, Akash, an artiste from Udupi, was on cloud nine for getting a chance to exhibit the art of Kangilu, a traditional dance form from Karnataka, as a part of the Republic Day’s main cultural attraction — Vande Bharatam Nritya Utsav. Interacting with artistes from Gujarat, even as many visitors approached him for selfies, Akash said the last three months had been all about auditions to be one of 480 performers from 15 states to showcase his footwork on Rajpath. “My group and I are really proud as we got the chance to be a part of such a historic celebration. It’s one of the best days of my life and an answer to my dilemma of continuing as an artiste,” said Akash, adding that he believed that the Kangilu performance was quite apt during the pandemic. “Kangilu is based on the idea of remedy when a pandemic is taking over mankind. Through the spiritual dance, Koragajja, a form of Lord Shiva, comes down to end the pandemic,” said Ankit, another dancer from Udupi who performed as Koragajja. The Union ministries of defence and culture had held “Vande Mataram Nritya Utsav” to select dance groups to perform for the first time as part of Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav to commemorate 75 years of India’s Independence. For 17-year-old Hemant Mali, a student from Maharashtra’s Jalgaon, performing in the Republic Day parade was the happiest moment of his life. The teenager was excited that his dance was seen by the Prime Minister and the President. Mali, who aspires to become a theatre artiste, told TOI, “I’m feeling great that I got such an opportunity to perform at this national event.” Vedant Bagade, a 16-year-old boy, said he was initially nervous, but felt proud of himself after the performance. “I now want to join the Indian Army,” he added. Similarly, Ranjeeta Rajesh (22), a resident of Delhi, said she was proud to be a part of the celebrations. Kumar, who led a group of dancers from Gujarat, believed that everyone was a winner. Ankit Shaw, a 17-year-old Class XII student, had come from Kolkata to participate in the event. “I wish we are given a chance again next year. I could only catch a glimpse of the President and the PM from a distance, but I’m still happy.” His friend, Raj Hela (17), a Class IX student, said, “I love to dance. I want to show my skills to everyone and make my country proud.” “We had no doubt that we would make it to Rajpath, even though the competition was stiff and there were 3,800 contestants. But now that we have given our performance, I still can’t believe it. We will always cherish this memory. I’ll now definitely pursue a career as a dancer,” said 19-year-old Astha from Ahmedabad. Dressed as a doll, 17-year-old Sandhya said her entire village in Mangalore was glued to the television. “Our act was to perform as if a doll had just come to life or woken up. We are all very happy. No one from my village had ever appeared on national television. It is a proud moment for me and my family,” she added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/in-perfect-sync-dancers-step-up-to-steal-the-show/articleshow/89143080.cms||Kushagra Dixit

He was speaking after unfurling the tri-colour on the occasion of the 73rd Republic Day celebration at Nehru Maidan on Wednesday. The minister said, “I have the responsibility to take up more development works in the district with the highest literacy rate. On the deemed forest issue, Sunil Kumar said that issue has been prevailing for the past 20 years. “After holding talks with the forest and revenue department officials, the government has decided to further reduce the extent of deemed forest area. Out of the currently available 66,428 ha deemed forest, 34,000 ha will be dropped,” he said. On vaccination rate, he said, 97% have received the first dose and 81% have got both the doses. The rest will be covered soon. Around 16 medical oxygen plants have been installed. The government has sanctioned a 13 kl tanker for the District Wenlock Hospital. Under the AMRUT scheme, it has decided to upgrade 25 primary healthcare centres. The bed capacity in the district hospital will be increased under the Smart City project. “The district has witnessed positive growth in arecanut, coconut and paddy cultivation. According to data, 97% of farmers are engaged in agriculture on 11,000 ha land. The Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi is benefiting close to 1.5 lakh farmers and Rs 219 crore has been utilised. Under the Mukhyamantri Raita Vidyanidhi scheme, Rs 4.2 crore in scholarships has been disbursed to 1,600 students, who are the children of farmers,” he said. At the NMPT, A V Ramana, chairman, New Mangalore Port Trust, presided over the celebration, and reviewed the parade by CISF unit Panambur and NMPT fire service. At airport Aviation Support Group (ASG) personnel of the CISF led the way at the Mangaluru International Airport (MIA). The highlight of the celebration was a riveting display of various aspects of training that the ASG personnel undergo, to keep the airport a safe place. Demonstration of reflex shooting techniques saw the ASG commandos cover all bases in a real-life situation, and their mastery of the krav maga martial art, kept the gathering on the edge of their seats. The loudest cheer went to the canine warriors – Jack, Bruno and Julie – who impressed everyone alike, with their sense of obedience and duty. In Udupi Minister for fisheries, ports and inland water transport and district minister S Angara unfurled the tricolour at the Mahatma Gandhi district stadium, Ajjarkad, and paid floral tributes to Mahatma Gandhi and Dr B R Ambedkar.

---||Delhi||Delhi: After 13 years of Republic Day ceremonies, Virat calls it a day||NEW DELHI: Virat is now trotting off into the sunset after taking part in the Republic Day celebrations for the past 13 years. Bidding him a fond farewell, President Ram Nath Kovind, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and defence minister Rajnath Singh patted the magnificent Hanoverian after the annual parade concluded on Rajpath on Wednesday. “Virat, who served as the mount of the President’s Bodyguard (PBG) commandant for over a decade, is a beautiful horse with a calm and dignified manner. This was his last Republic Day parade before he formally retires,” an Army officer said. Ahead of his impending retirement, Virat was awarded the Chief of the Army Staff’s commendation, along with two dogs Darmi and Heena, on the eve of the Army Day on January 15 for “exceptional service and abilities”. Within a few years of joining the elite PBG as a three-year-old in 2003, Virat became the commandant’s charger, escorting and saluting the President at the Republic Day celebrations as well as other ceremonial functions, including those for the visiting heads of states. “With his natural beauty with a high arch of head, graceful stride and serene temperament, he was the most trustworthy horse in PBG. It’s not easy for a horse to maintain calm among the huge crowds of Republic Day parades, with guns booming in the background,” the officer said. “Successive Presidents and foreign dignitaries often complemented Virat. But he has become old now and deserves a well-earned rest.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/after-13-years-of-r-day-ceremonies-virat-calls-it-a-day/articleshow/89143098.cms||---
---||Delhi||PPP falls flat, South Delhi Municipal Corporation to take up Shaheedi Park revamp on own||NEW DELHI: South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) has agreed to take up projects for Shaheedi Park at ITO and a Bollywood park in Jangpura after officials submitted a fresh proposal for developing the facilities through its own funds rather than on the public-private partnership (PPP) basis. The proposal will be tabled before the standing committee on Monday. Last month, the committee rejected them, expressing disapproval over the PPP model and sharing of revenue for the next few decades. “When we are providing land and scrap material, too, there is no point inviting private players to develop the site and share revenues. We had floated the idea to arrange funds from different sources and complete the project in a phased manner even if it takes a little longer,” said standing committee chairman Lt Col B K Oberoi (retd) . The proposal suggests to rename Shaheedi Park as Amrit Mahotsav Park and SDMC is hoping to get funds from the Union housing and urban affairs ministry. “There is hope that Rs 30 crore will be provided to begin work at the site,” said Oberoi. The park will be revamped by highlighting events related to the Independence. “At the park, sets/sculptures of historical events and figures, including Chandragupta Maurya, Ashoka, Porus, Vikramaditya, Samudragupta, Battle of Haldighati, Maratha Empire, Sikh Empire, battle of 1857, Simon Commission, Jallianwala Bagh masscare, Kakori conspiracy, and statues of Sardar Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, Sukhdev, will be prepared using waste material,” the proposal stated. Based on the availability of funds, the corporation will take up work at the eight-acre park near Jangpura for developing a Bollywood park. The project plan includes erecting 3D/2D cutouts of film stars, showcasing process of filmmaking and equipment used during film production. There is also a plan to have a 3D museum with figures of known artistes accepting Filmfare Awards.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/ppp-falls-flat-s-corpn-to-take-up-shaheedi-park-revamp-on-own/articleshow/89143091.cms||Vibha Sharma

He told reporters here that there is no internal disturbance in the party which is being organised under collective leadership. Reacting to BJP leader Ramesh Jarakiholi’s assertion that a few Congress leaders are in touch with him and are ready to join BJP, the former MP said Jarkiholi must concentrate on the disappointment that has erupted in BJP over the appointment of district ministers. “Jarkiholi was not invited to the meeting held by BJP leaders at Umesh Katti’s residence. BJP is struggling with internal fights. Let BJP leaders resolve their problems first before making false statements about Congress,” he said. On the reappointment of housing minister V Somanna as Chamarajanagar district minister, Dhruvanarayana said the BJP government has completely neglected the district. Expressing anger against the government for filing an FIR against Congress leaders who took part in the Mekedatu padayatra, Dhruvanarayana questioned the government for not filing a case against BJP leaders who took part in the oath taking ceremony of MLCs where more than 2,000 people had gathered without following Covid guidelines. “Even the chief minister and home minister participated in the event. BJP leader Renukacharya recently participated in a big fair in his constituency. On Tuesday, there was a huge fair in Chamarajanagar which was attended by Somanna. Action must be initiated against the BJP leaders. Congress has written to the chief secretary on the issue,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/there-is-a-wave-in-favour-of-congress-says-dhruvanarayana/articleshow/89142654.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Hansraj cow centre in place of girls’ hostel, allege students||NEW DELHI: A group of students of Hansraj College has claimed that Swami Dayanand Saraswati Cow Protection Research Centre, which was constructed two months ago inside the Delhi University institution, has been set up at a site allocated for a women’s hostel. The college principal refuted the allegation. The college administration is prioritising the “protection and promotion of cows” instead of woes faced by women students, students alleged. “Our administration demanded payment of full fees during the pandemic, though most of our families were facing economic hardships. Now we learn that while the campus has been shut, the college has finished constructing a full-fledged gaushala without any discussion with the student community,” said Samaa, president of the college’s Students’ Federation of India (SFI) unit. According to an SFI statement, girls coming from outside the national capital region find “it terribly difficult to find safe and affordable housing. The facility of a hostel on the campus — especially for scholarship or reservation students who may get some concessions — is the best option to pursue their academics”. However, principal Rama Sharma claimed, “The location of the centre has nothing to do with the hostel land. This particular land was used to conduct RT-PCR tests during the second Covid-19 wave and it does not even have enough space to build a hostel.” She said the centre had been built for research purposes to explore the possibilities of the college becoming “self-sufficient” in dairy products. “We follow Arya Samaj, and once a month, the college conducts havans, for which products like ghee and cow dung are required,” she said. Following DU’s decision to push innovation projects, the college is trying to see if it “can become self-sufficient”, she said. The college is planning to build a hostel for 100 girls, but has floated an e-tender for a smaller one that can accommodate 25-30 students for the time being, the principal said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/hansraj-cow-centre-in-place-of-girls-hostel-allege-students/articleshow/89143111.cms||---

The trials will involve a total of 600 adults -- half of whom have already received two doses of Moderna's vaccine at least six months ago, and half of whom have received two doses plus the previously authorized booster dose. The booster specifically targeting Omicron will therefore be evaluated as both a third and a fourth dose.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/moderna-begins-trial-of-omicron-specific-vaccine-booster/articleshow/89144589.cms||---

The deceased, Gulzar, lived in a JJ cluster area in northwest Delhi's Azadpur. The incident was reported on Monday on the birthday of victim’s friend, Rahul.Gulzar and his friend, Suraj, were on their way to a park where they were supposed to meet Rahul. “On the way, they met Gaurav and Ajay. Both of them were known to Gulzar,” an officer said. An argument that ensued between Gaurav and Suraj over an issue related to a girl, soon turned into a scuffle. “Ajay and Gaurav started beating Suraj. One of them took out a knife,” an officer said, adding that Gulzar tried to pacify them when one of the accused stabbed him and fled the spot. “He was taken to a hospital where doctors declared him dead,” the officer said.

Following his decision, Congress on Thursday nominated Ranjit Rane, a relative of Pratapsingh to contest from the Poriem constituency. Congress had nominated Pratapisingh last month no sooner than it announced its first list, but there was uncertainty about his candidature with him not making a clear statement on the issue.  He has been the senior-most functionary of the Congress in Goa and has been representing Poriem in the assembly for around 50 years. Since BJP announced its Poriem ticket to his daughter-in-law Deviya, it appeared like Goa would witness a family feud in Poriem. The senioe legislator’s visit to a temple in his constituency, two days ago, along with his wife Vijayadevi and supporters led to speculations that indeed there will be a Rane vs Rane fight in Poriem. However, later he told TOI that a mere visit to the temple cannot be construed that he was there to kick-start his campaign. On Thursday, Congress announced its final list. Apart from the replacement for the former CM, it declared a candidate for the Sanvordem constituency by nominating Khemlo Sawant who is from Amona in North Goa. With it, Congress has named candidates for all the 37 seats it is contesting. Three seats it has allotted to its alliance partner GFP. Rahul Gandhi is likely to release the Congress manifesto on February 2, a senior Congress functionary said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/goa/news/sr-rane-decides-not-to-contest-elections/articleshow/89169047.cms||TNN

Son of retired police sub-inspector T N Thimmappa and homemaker Vijayalakshmi, from Vinayanagar in Kumbashi, Manjunath was always keen on joining the armed forces. He told TOI over the phone after the parade on Wednesday, “It’s an honour to lead our contingent. It has been my dream, and I believe that I have done my best. Everyone has been congratulating me. It’s a good opportunity, and I really aspired for this role ever since I was a student. I tried hard to be part of the Republic Day parade as an NCC cadet. As an NSS volunteer, I was selected to participate at the national level, but could not make it due to some issues. I was part of the state NSS team that took part in the Republic Day parade in Bengaluru in 2007.” Expressing happiness over serving in the Indian Coast Guard, he said that it is a multi-mission organisation conducting round-the-year real-life operations at sea. There are a lot of good opportunities in the organisation, said Manjunath, who is currently posted in Delhi, and married to Vidyarani. Manjunath has three older sisters, who are teachers. Back home in Kundapur, his father Thimmappa said, “It is indeed a proud moment for the state and a time to celebrate at home. Due to the pandemic, we watched our son lead the contigent on the television screen. People from Hosanagar, our hometown, Bhatkal, where I served in the police for two decades, and Udupi are reaching out to congratulate us,” Thimmappa said. Manjunath did his schooling at the New English School and college at Anjuman Arts, Science and Commerce College, Bhatkal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/officer-from-kundapur-leads-coast-guard-contingent-at-rajpath/articleshow/89142472.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv
---||Delhi||Republic Day parade: Largest-ever fleet of 75 aircraft with aerial view from cockpit||NEW DELHI: The flypast of Indian Air Force (IAF) on Wednesday was the grandest ever in the history of the Republic Day parade as the largest-ever fleet of 75 aircraft, including newly-acquired Rafale fighters, showcased the country’s aerial assets over Rajpath. In a first, spectators were able to get an aerial view of the flypast as the defence ministry put out its stunning footage taken from the cockpits of some of the aircraft. IAF coordinated with the public broadcaster Doordarshan to show the recorded in-flight videos. Magnificent visuals of different aircraft formations flying above the clouds were telecast and also shown on large screens installed at the parade venue. During the show, the vintage as well as modern aircraft, such as Rafale, Sukhoi, Jaguar, Mi-17, Sarang, Apache and Dakota, displayed different formations, including Rahat, Meghna, Eklavya, Trishul, Tiranga, Vijay and Amrit, over Central Vista. The country’s first woman fighter pilot, Flight Lieutenant Shivangi Singh, who is flying the multi-role Rafale fighter, became the second woman fighter pilot to be part of an IAF tableau. Last year, Flt Lt Bhawna Kanth became the first woman fighter pilot to be part of the parade. Flt Lt Singh, who is from Varanasi and joined the force in 2017, was flying MiG-21 Bison before being inducted into IAF’s elite Golden Arrows squadron of Rafale aircraft. IAF is the first force of the three wings to have allowed women officers in combat and has the highest percentage of women officers. The flypast began with the Dhwaj formation by four Mi-17 aircraft, followed by Rudra and Rahat with four and five Advanced Light Helicopters (ALH), respectively. Next was the Tangail formation, which saw one Dakota and two Dorniers flying in Vic formation, in a tribute to the Tangail airdrop operations during the 1971 Indo-Pakistan war. It was followed by Traan and Netra. Next was the Vinaash formation comprising five Rafale aircraft, followed by Baaz and Trishul formations. In a tweet, defence ministry principal spokesperson A Bharat Bhushan Babu said, “Cockpit view of Baaz formation comprising 1 Rafale, 2 Jaguar, 2 MiG-29 UPG, 2 Su-30 MI ac in seven ac ‘Arrowhead’ formation flying at 300m AOL (sic).” For Tiranga, five Sarang (ALH) flew in a ladder formation streaming Tricolour after the Varuna formation. In Amrit, 17 Jaguar aircraft made a figure of 75 to mark the 75th year of Independence or Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/largest-ever-fleet-of-75-aircraft-with-aerial-view-from-cockpit/articleshow/89143120.cms||Surendra Singh

According to the corporation, this exercise was part of the nationwide Swachh Bharat Mission Urban 2.0 and the inspection took place between December 14 and 17 last year. The third party surveyed 44 spots such as community toilet complexes and public toilets along with few slums, residential colonies and markets in the jurisdiction. “The team found community toilets, public toilets and urinals very clean and aspirational. It is a collective effort of all the officials of north corporation who worked day and night to get ODF+ tag. It was very challenging for us despite demography and population density here,” Goel said. In the past few months, the corporation held meetings with resident welfare associations, market associations, and other representatives, and also organised workshops for officials.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/north-corpn-secures-certificate-for-being-open-defecation-free/articleshow/89143125.cms||---
---||Delhi||Republic Day parade: Several firsts, Vintage uniforms, new combat dress, grand flypast||NEW DELHI: The 73rd Republic Day parade was special as it marked many firsts. While the marching contingents of Indian Army showcased the evolution in uniform and personnel weapons of soldiers over several decades and displayed its new combat dress, IAF displayed its might with a grand flypast of 75 aircraft in the 75th year of Independence to celebrate ‘Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav’. For the first time, the parade included the launch of ‘Shaheedon Ko Shat Shat Naman’ programme by NCC, cultural performances by a contingent of 480 dancers selected through a nationwide competition and the event displayed on 10 giant scrolls. These scrolls, painted in Bhubaneswar and Chandigarh by over 600 renowned artists and young aspirants, were prepared during the ‘Kala Kumbh’, jointly organised by ministries of defence and culture. The parade started half an hour late at 10.30am to ensure better visibility. Authorities also shortened the route, which normally culminates at Red Fort. The number of people who attended was limited to 5,000 and included only fully vaccinated adults and children aged over 15. Though the mega event on Rajpath missed a foreign chief guest for the second consecutive year due to the pandemic, India’s military might and cultural diversity were on full display. For the first time, auto drivers, construction employees, sanitation workers and frontline workers were invited as special guests. After the traditional unfurling of the Tricolour, the parade commenced as President Ram Nath Kovind received a 21-gun salute. The Army displayed the Centurion and PT-76 tanks, 75/24 Pack Howitzer and OT-62 Topaz armoured personnel carrier, which played a major role in defeating Pakistan in the 1971 war. The mechanised columns also showcased two MBT Arjun MK-I tanks, one BMP-I and two BMP-II infantry fighting vehicles. Rajput Regiment soldiers wore uniform from the 1950s and carried vintage Lee-Enfield .303 rifles. They were followed by Assam Regiment troops donning 1960s’ uniform and carrying .303 rifles. The Jammu & Kashmir Light Infantry were next, seen in uniform of the 1970s and with 7.62mm self-loading rifles. Soldiers of the Sikh Light Infantry and Army Ordnance Corps, in turn, donned the present-day olive-green uniforms along with current 5.56mm INSAS service rifles. The Parachute Regiment contingent donned the new combat uniform with a “digital disruptive pattern”, unveiled on Army Day this year, and carried Israel-made 5.56mm x 45mm Tavor rifles. The Naval contingent comprised 96 sailors and four officers led by Lt Cdr Aanchal Sharma as contingent commander. The tableau’s front depicted the Naval Uprising of 1946, which contributed to India’s struggle for independence, while the rear section illustrated the ‘Make in India’ initiatives of the Navy from 1983 to 2021. The IAF tableau showcased scaled-down models of MiG-21, Gnat, Light Combat Helicopter and Rafale aircraft as well as the Aslesha radar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/several-firsts-vintage-uniforms-new-combat-dress-grand-flypast/articleshow/89143133.cms||Surendra Singh

This election, the people will judge Babush as a person,” Monserrate said. Utpal Parrikar along with his relatives, friends and supporters at Mahalaxmi temple, Panaji, before filing his nominationMonserrate, Utpal and Congress candidate Elvis Gomes filed their nominations on Thursday to contest from Panaji. Prior to filing his nomination, Utpal said that he will fight against money and muscle power, while Monserrate said, “Legacy is not monarchy, and everyone has to face an election.” Manohar Parrikar represented the Panaji seat for over two decades since 1994. After he was elevated to the position of defence minister in 2014, BJP had fielded Parrikar’s close aide Sidharth Kuncalienkar who had won the seat for BJP. Kuncalienker had also won the assembly election 2017 by defeating Monserrate who was the United Goans Party candidate for Panaji. When Parrikar returned to the state as the chief minister, Kuncalienkar vacated the seat for Parrikar to contest and BJP once again won the Panaji seat. After the demise of Parrikar, Kuncalienkar and Utpal, both staked claim for BJP’s candidature during the 2019 bypoll in Panaji. But BJP then too had denied candidature to Utpal. Monserrate, who was the Congress candidate then, made a dent in BJP’s bastion to grab the seat for Congress for the first time after 1994. Asked about carrying forward Parrikar’s legacy in Panaji, Monserrate said, “What is legacy? Legacy is not monarchy. The father is there and after that the son will come. It is a democracy. Everyone has to go for an election, my wife is Taleigao MLA she was not nominated. Basically, everyone has contested. My son is a mayor, he has also contested. If you have the wish of the people... that is the reason we are here.” Monserrate said that Manohar Parrikar was a leader with a different class and he cannot be compared to him. Before filing their nominations, both Monserrate and Utpal had a show of strength during their visit to the Mahalaxmi temple in Panaji. Monserrate said that priority of Panaji constituency is development and employment. When asked to react on Utpal’s decision to contest assembly election, Monserrate said “There are so many other political parties contesting, why are you taking out one particular name. We are going to fight with everyone. I know that the people of Panaji know me very well and I will get overwhelming support from the people of Panaji and win with thumping majority.” Stating that the constituency of Panaji is not new to him, Monserrate said that during the last five terms his panel has been governing the Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) and he is the MLA of Panaji since the last two and half years. “All parties have fielded strong candidates in Panaji,” he said. Reacting to Utpal’s allegations, Monserrate said, “Why are these allegations coming up now? I joined BJP two-and-half years ago and there was no allegation that time, the moment they realised I was not jumping ship, all these allegations started. Basically, these people thought that I would jump ship and they would get a chance. As clear as that.” After taking the blessings at the temple, Utpal said, “I am hopeful and confident that the people of Panaji will bless me. I will follow the footsteps of my father while working for Panaji. I will do 200% hard work in Panaji.” He also said that the people of Panaji are wise to vote for the future of Panaji. Prior to filing his nomination, Gomes, a former bureaucrat, said that he wants to become the voice of the people and give new leadership. He said that out of 22 years in Panaji, he has worked in Panaji for 21 years, including three years in CCP. “People of Panaji have got an opportunity to elect a good candidate,” Gomes said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/goa/news/i-have-always-said-after-parrikar-its-me-babush/articleshow/89168957.cms||---

---||Goa||Last few weeks have been difficult for Goa: Princeton||Panaji: These are not the best of days for FC Goa. A team built to finish at the top is now struggling with just three wins in 13 matches. The former League champions are winless in their last three matches against lower-ranked opponents and have just one win in their last eight games. Even off the field, it hasn’t looked good. Goa were the first to report Covid-19 positive cases inside their bio-secure bubble and the team was forced inside for the past few weeks, allowed out only to train. “It’s very difficult for any player or staff member,” said Goa midfielder Princeton Rebello. “We are without our families here. The most important thing is that we enjoy playing football, but we cannot do that in front of the fans at the stadium. The coaches and management support us through these difficult times, but it’s not as easy as people think.” For several weeks now, those inside the Goa bubble have not seen normal lives. Except for training, they cannot step outside their rooms, meals are served at the doorstep and team meetings are held online. Not surprisingly, the extraordinarily tough bubble life this season has taken a toll on the players. “When inside our rooms, we just watch movies, play games and talk to our families. We cannot move out of the hotel. There are restricted areas. “It was very difficult for us these couple of weeks, locked inside our rooms. We also didn’t train for some days. It was very frustrating to do workouts in the room,” said Rebello, one of the brightest young players in the team. Even coach Derick Pereira admitted that the players have found the going tough this season. “These are difficult times, the conditions are tough. Players need to train, move out, and cannot be kept in their rooms. Just going out for training and coming back to the rooms doesn’t help. “The players and staff are going through these tough conditions. These are not excuses, but as a team, we are focused. As professionals, we need to clear our minds and put in good efforts. There are times we lost focus,” said Pereira. Goa are ninth on the table with 14 points from 13 matches and must win against Jamshedpur FC on Friday to have any chance of qualifying for the playoffs.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/last-few-weeks-have-been-difficult-for-goa-princeton/articleshow/89166051.cms||---

Patil, who unfurled the Tricolour during the Republic Day celebrations in Chitradurga, said, “Siddaramaiah is under the impression that we will return to the Congress. But we have not forgotten how we were harassed when we tendered our resignation. But setting aside party affiliation, we remain friends with members of the Congress party, and we conduct ourselves courteously when we meet one another. Siddaramaiah has misinterpreted this, and seems to think we will join the Congress again. None of us who left the Congress will return to its fold.” On BJP colleague Basangoud Patil Yatnal’s allegations of a few ministers being in touch with the Congress, the agriculture minister said, “Yatnal must refrain from making such statements. If he is aware of the identity of those who are looking to join the Congress party, he should reveal their names.” On the appointment of legislators being appointed ministers for districts apart from the ones they hailed from, Patil said, “The Karnataka government has followed the model that is currently in place in Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh. No minister must be restricted to one district and must helm the administration of whichever district one is assigned.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/siddaramaiah-mistaken-about-mlas-returning-to-congress-says-bc-patil/articleshow/89142558.cms||---
---||Goa||Asian Cup 2022: Vietnam, Thailand scrape through to quarterfinals||The group games in the AFC Women’s Asian Cup 2022 ended on a predictable note with the big guns finishing on top and booking comparatively easier slots in the quarterfinals. Two-time champions Japan dropped points against Korea Republic in a 1-1 draw but still finished on top of group C, while Australia conceded a goal – their first in the tournament -- at the fag end against Thailand that did not change either the match result or their place on top of group B. The former champions won 2-1 and will now face Korea in a mouth-watering tie for a place in the semifinals. Japan, Australia and China finished as group winners while Korea, Chinese Taipei and Philippines emerged runnersup. From among the three third-placed teams, Vietnam and Thailand were lucky enough to book a place in the knockout stage and keep their dream of a securing a World Cup 2023 spot alive. Iran were the only third-placed team to have been knocked out, having lost 0-7 against eight-time champions China and 0-5 against Chinese Taipei. India, the fourth team in group A, were considered to have withdrawn after failing to field 13 players in their second group clash against Chinese Taipei on Sunday. All matches of the hosts were cancelled and considered null and void, pursuant to Article 6.5.5 of the competition regulations. The Philippines booked their spot in the quarterfinals after defeating Indonesia 6-0 to finish as group B runners-up. Eager to advance to the knockout stage for the second successive edition, Philippines applied pressure from the start and scored at regular intervals.  In another match at the D.Y. Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai, Vietnam and Myanmar played a 2-2 draw.  Vietnam came from behind twice to salvage a point and finish third, a result that was good enough for them to make it to the knockout stage as one of the two best third-placed teams to join the respective group winners and runners-up in the quarterfinals on Sunday.  Quarterfinal lineup (January 30): Australia vs Korea Republic, Mumbai, 1.30pm; Japan vs Thailand, Navi Mumbai, 1.30pm; China vs Vietnam, Navi Mumbai, 5.30pm; Chinese Taipei vs Philippines, Pune, 5.30pm.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/asian-cup-2022-vietnam-thailand-scrape-through-to-quarterfinals/articleshow/89166093.cms||---
---||Mysuru||Somashekar dismisses Siddaramaiah’s statements on defection||Mysuru: District minister ST Somashekar on Wednesday dismissed KPCC chief DK Shivakumar and opposition leader Siddaramaiah’s assertion that over a dozen BJP MLAs are ready to switch sides to Congress. “Congress leaders do not have any other work to do. They simply indulge in wild speculation. But we in BJP have work to do to help people and govern the state. We would rather work than react to them,” he told reporters. “It has now become a habit for senior political leaders to claim MLAs from opposition camps are in their touch. Such speculation is not good for governance,” he said, adding the netas should name the MLAs who want to switch over or allow BJP to develop the state. He also disapproved of former minister and BJP MLA Ramesh Jarkiholi’s counter claim that many Congress MLAs could cross over to BJP. This comes amidst former minister and disgruntled JD(S) MLA GT Devegowda arguing that legislators crossing over to other parties ahead of the assembly polls will be minimal this season as all the three political parties in the state are strong. “Congress, BJP and JD(S) are strong in the state. There are no visible signs of prominent leaders or MLAs crossing over to the opposition,” he told reporters. Devegowda said when the assembly polls are 15 months away, talks of political realignment in the state are irrelevant.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/somashekar-dismisses-siddaramaiahs-statements-on-defection/articleshow/89142632.cms||---
---||Goa||ISL: For under-pressure Goa, win is all that matters||FC Goa’s record has been poor this season, whether it’s Juan Ferrando or Derrick Pereira at the helm of affairs. The former League champions are winless in their last three matches against lowly-ranked opponents and have just one win in their last eight games. For a team who have qualified for the semi-finals in the last four editions, that should be a cause for concern and coach Pereira admitted as much, ahead of an important clash against Jamshedpur FC at the GMC Athletic Stadium in Bambolim on Friday. “It’s tough now (to qualify) but we will take it match by match,” Pereira told TOI during an online media interaction on Thursday. “We are a team that should not be in the position that we are right now, for whatever reasons. There are lot of reasons behind it. The players give their best, they keep working hard.” Goa are ninth on the table with 14 points from 13 matches. What’s more concerning is the negative goal difference, a clear reflection that the team hasn’t scored enough this season. While most of the blame will be placed at the feet of the foreign attackers who are expected to do the bulk of the scoring, no Indian player has scored for Goa since Devendra Murgaonkar found the back of the net against Bengaluru FC more than a month ago. The domestic players have scored just two goals – Alexander Romario being the other -- and provided two assists. The return of Brandon Fernandes can change that. The midfielder took the field towards the fag end of the match against Bengaluru and is now ready for a larger, more influential role. His presence can create more opportunities in front of goal, though Goa’s problems cannot be wished away so easily. “The conditions are tough here. The results are not going our way and there’s lot of mental pressure on the players. That’s why we tend to lose focus during the game at times,” said Pereira, whose side will have to be alert, having lost to Jamshedpur 1-3 in the first leg. Jamshedpur are third on the points table with 19 points from 11 games and a win will take them closer to pole position. It’s a clear reflection of what Owen Coyle’s side has done this season, both in attack where Greg Stewart has been outstanding with five man-of-the-match awards, and in defence, where the back-four have been consistent. “I don't have any doubts that it is going to be a difficult match for us for a number of reasons - lack of training and being in quarantine for such a long period, which is a big challenge, both physically and mentally for the lads,” said Coyle. Jamshedpur were hit by Covid-19 that saw two of their games postponed and the team locked indoors for a long time. They last played on January 11 and Coyle will hope the momentum, thanks to last-gasp winners from Ishan Pandita against SC East Bengal and NorthEast United, isn’t lost. “There are players who are available for the match but there are a few who won’t make it. We have to make sure we are ready and aim to continue our winning run that we had going prior to the break,” said Coyle.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/isl-for-under-pressure-goa-win-is-all-that-matters/articleshow/89166158.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

A week ago, the positivity rate was hovering around the 11.2% mark. In the past seven days, the district has reported 7,882 Covid cases, but a steady discharge of infected patients has pushed the active caseload in Dharwad to the less alarming figure of 5,069, as on Wednesday. Members of the Dharwad district health task force have warned the people that the curve is likely to rise further, given that the transmission of the virus was reaching its peak. However, they also believe that, by the end of the first week of February, the third wave of Covid-19 is likely to start rolling back. Exhorting the public to adhere to safety norms, the members said that vigilance was the only way one could secure the safety of oneself and one’s family. Dharwad district in-charge minister Halappa Achar on Wednesday chaired a meeting convened to review the situation vis-à-vis Covid-19, with deputy commissioner Nitesh Patil among those in attendance. “We tested 38,603 people in the past one week, and 7,882 have tested positive for the novel coronavirus. Nearly 97% of those infected with Covid are quarantined at home, to whom we are distributing medicine kits at their doorstep. We have also arranged for these patients to consult doctors via telemedicine facility,” Nitesh Patil said. He added that the district administration had made necessary arrangements to treat Covid patients at Karnataka Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS), Hubballi, which could accommodate up to 1,400 patients. “Since people from neighbouring districts visit KIMS as well, we have upgraded the infrastructure to accommodate 2,400 patients,” the DC said. Patil said that, while there was no dearth of experts at KIMS, the hospital was facing a shortage of Group ‘D’ employees. “We have submitted a proposal to the medical education minister, requesting permission to recruit necessary staff, and we have received in-principle approval. We are awaiting the finance department’s nod to commence the process,” Patil said. Halappa Achar, meanwhile, said that medical infrastructure had been upgraded across government hospitals in the district. Lauding the doctors for working long hours, he added, “The state is in the midst of the third wave of Covid-19, and cases are surging. The doctors must rise to the occasion again, and save patients’ lives.” The minister assured the district administration of discussing the shortage of staff at KIMS with the rest of the cabinet. Achar asked the medical fraternity to lean on the experience it had garnered during the first two iterations of the pandemic to ensure that hospitals did not want for liquid medical oxygen, and other vital medicines. “Police and civic authorities must raise awareness on the need for the public to follow safety norms. They must enforce curbs stringently,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/covid-third-wave-grips-dharwad-positivity-rate-surges-to-23/articleshow/89142593.cms||GURURAJ JAMKHANDI
---||Delhi||Delhi reels under cold-day spell, relief unlikely today||NEW DELHI: The spell of “cold day” continued in Delhi for the third consecutive day on Wednesday. Parts of the national capital even witnessed “severe cold day” conditions. Any significant relief is unlikely on Thursday as India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted “cold day” conditions at isolated places. Despite an improvement from Tuesday, the maximum temperature was at 16.4 degrees Celsius, six degrees below normal, at Safdarjung, the city’s base station. Narela continued to be the coldest station as the day temperature was reported at 14.7 degrees Celsius, eight degrees below normal. The minimum temperature dipped to 5.8 degrees Celsius, three notches below normal, at Safdarjung, from Tuesday’s 6.2 degrees Celsius. According to IMD, Palam, Narela, Jafarpur and SPS Mayur Vihar saw a “severe cold day”, while most of the stations recorded a “cold day”, including Safdarjung, Ayanagar, Najafgarh, Pitampura and Ridge. Met officials said low cloud and wind pattern prevented the sunlight to reach the surface and caused “cold day” conditions. R K Jenamani, a senior scientist at IMD, predicted slight improvement on Thursday “as ‘cold day’ is predicted at a few stations”. On Tuesday, the day temperature was 12.1 degrees Celsius, the lowest maximum temperature recorded in January in nine years. It was the seventh lowest maximum in January at Safdarjung during 1951-2022, IMD said on Wednesday. The weather department has predicted “cold wave” conditions at a few places on Thursday and Friday. “As the minimum temperature is gradually dipping, there are chances of a ‘cold wave’ at isolated places. We are monitoring the situation,” said Jenamani. The air quality of the capital continued to remain in the “poor” category with an air quality index (AQI) of 260. System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), a central forecasting body, said, “Prevailing foggy conditions and low temperatures as well as low mixing layer height are preventing efficient ventilation of pollutants, leading to AQI to be within the ‘poor’ category for the next two days.” SAFAR predicted an improvement in AQI from January 29 due to a gradual increase in day temperature that would dilute near-surface pollutants.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/city-reels-under-cold-day-spell-relief-unlikely-today/articleshow/89143304.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||India||Arunachal youth will be returned soon, PLA has indicated: Rijiju||NEW DELHI: After a hotline exchange with the Indian Army, China’s People’s Liberation Army has indicated that they would soon hand over the missing youth from Arunachal Pradesh, law minister Kiren Rijiju said on Wednesday. “The delay was attributed to bad weather conditions on their (Chinese) side,” the minister said while giving details of the exchange between the officials of Indian Army and PLA on the occasion of the Republic Day. He said the PLA has assured that the date, time and place of release of the youth would be intimated soon. Earlier, Rijiju had tweeted about the missing youth and said the Indian Army had approached the PLA sharing with them a picture of the boy with other details. “We are constantly following the case from day one. I appeal to everyone to be cautious in making statements which are not based on facts because the safety and return of our youth from Arunachal Pradesh is priority,” he said. Miram Taron, 19-year old from Jido village in Upper Siang district, went missing on January 18 near Shiyung La (Bishing area) bordering the Line of Actual Control. After the Indian Army approached PLA, the Chinese side assured that “they would search the individual and return him as per established protocol”, the minister had said. On January 20, the Chinese side had informed the Indian Army officials that they had found an Indian boy on their side and requested for further details to establish his identity. The report of the missing boy first came to light when Arunachal East MP Tapir Gao wrote on Twitter on January 19 that a youth was abducted from inside the Indian territory.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/arunachal-youth-will-be-returned-soon-pla-has-indicated-rijiju/articleshow/89144701.cms||---

Shettar, participating in an event organised by the taluk administration to celebrate Republic Day at Nehru Stadium, added that the Union ministry of road transport and highways had approved the project to widen the bypass road in the twin cities to six lanes. “Work on a slew of Smart City projects is under way, and these will be completed soon,” said the former CM. The Constitution drafted by the BR Ambedkar-headed committee had helped play a crucial role in the uplift of the poor, besides helping the downtrodden rise to the highest echelons of power, said Shettar. He also urged people not to disregard Covid protocol, adding that the infection was yet to be eradicated entirely. MLA Prasad Abbayya, who also participated in the event, said that the Indian Constitution was superior to that of any other country’s. “Equality of rights to everyone, irrespective of caste and creed is the credo of the Constitution,” he said. In his address, Hubballi tahsildar Sashidhar Madyal, who unfurled the Tricolour at Nehru Stadium, enumerated all the schemes that the state government had rolled out in the taluk. MLC Pradeep Shettar, tahsildar for Hubballi Rural Prakash Nashi were among those who attended the event, which was closed to the public – only police and homeguards were in attendance – owing to the prevalence of Covid in the twin cities. South Western Railway (SWR) general manager Sanjeev Kishore, who hoisted the National Flag at the Rail Soudha in Hubballi, hailed the resilience and commitment that each railway employee had shown in the two years blighted by the pandemic. He cited the increase in revenue, and the increase in the freight carried by SWR in the current fiscal year compared to the previous one, to highlight the accomplishments of the division. President of Karnatak Chamber of Commerce and Industry Vinay Javali, who unfurled the Tricolour in the presence of all the officebearers, congratulated fellow member Abdul Khadar Nadakattin, who was honoured with the Padma Shree. At the KLE Prerana PU College, principal Mallikarjuna Rao hoisted the National Flag, and highlighted the significance of the Constitution to the world. Meanwhile, at the Adarsh PU Science College, second PU students Rakshita Doddamani and Anjali Patil hoisted the Tricolour. Former chairman of North West Karnataka Road Transport Corporation Mallikarjun Savakar, who participated in the event, spoke about the Constitution, while college directors Lingaraj Patil, SB Kunnur, BC Goudar and Daniel Hoskeri were among those who graced the occasion. The Rajat Ullagaddimath Foundation, meanwhile, donated kits containing cooker and plates to pourakarmikas and yoga practitioners in Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation ward 51. In addition to Ullagaddimath, Rajashekar Swamiji, ward corporator-designate Sandil Kumar were present at the event.

---||Delhi||Delhi Jal Board starts sealing of industrial units polluting Yamuna||By: Siddhanta Mishra NEW DELHI: Yamuna cleaning cell is stepping up its efforts to crack down on polluting industries in the national capital. The cell has formed 11 teams to survey industrial and redevelopment areas to catch violators of norms. The teams will also have Delhi State Industrial Development Corporation and Delhi Pollution Control Committee members. The assistant chief engineers of the Delhi Jal Board will be heading these teams. The cell has focused mainly upon 25 redevelopment areas, where new surveys and checks have commenced. The teams have been directed to take action against illegal water-polluting industries with immediate effect. The exercise will be carried out assembly constituency-wise and action will be taken accordingly. Earlier, the board had identified three areas — Moti Nagar, Mayapuri and Wazirpur — to check for electroplating industries causing water pollution. The technology is widely used in decorative arts to improve the surface qualities of objects. The chief executive officer of the Delhi Jal Board has also roped Jamia university into conducting the survey. The surveyors will be assisted by officials from the Delhi Pollution Control Committee and civil defence volunteers. According to the Delhi Pollution Control Committee, around 2,000 water-polluting industries are currently operating in Delhi in just the notified industrial areas. As per the latest directions, DJB officials shall issue a notice to the water-polluting industry if it finds that the establishment is not connected to any common effluent treatment plant. If, even after that, the industry does not comply with the rules and regulations, then it will be sealed and further notices will be issued to discoms and DJB to disconnect water and electricity supply to the unit. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has set 2025 as the deadline to clean the Yamuna; hence the special focus is to stop any direct flow of harmful effluents into the river.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/djb-starts-sealing-of-industrial-units-polluting-yamuna/articleshow/89143311.cms||---
---||Goa||With some U-17 players, we could have given Chinese Taipei a good game: Thomas Dennerby||India women’s football coach Thomas Dennerby has spent the last few days isolating in a hotel room. Nineteen players and six staff tested positive for Covid-19 and India were forced out of the Asian Cup 2022 at home, unable to field the mandatory 13 players. In this exclusive interview with TOI, the 62-year-old Swedish coach explains what hurts him the most. Excerpts… After the heartbreak of being forced out of the Asian Cup, did you manage to speak to the players? How are the girls doing? I send them messages on WhatsApp, trying to support as well as I can from my room. But it’s a tough situation and everybody understands. We have the doctor who checks on everyone. They are getting better. Some are asymptomatic, while others have cough and fever. Being forced out of the Asian Cup like this is tough. Does being quarantined inside your own rooms make it even more difficult? I don’t know if it’s more difficult now or before, but it’s still a tough situation. I don’t know how long I have to be here (indoors). If you ask the doctors, it could be upto 21 days. In this situation, you want the girls to go back to their families and get the support. It's not ideal to be alone in the room. What were your feelings when you learned that India didn’t have enough players and would be forced out of the Asian Cup? First of all, I was very sorry for the girls. This was my eighth experience at a major championship – three World Cups, two Olympics and two European championships – but for these girls, some of them, it was a lifetime chance to perform and show the world how good they are. Of course, it’s disappointing and heart-breaking. More than myself, I was feeling depressed that this happened with these players and the federation (AIFF). I can handle this, even though I must admit I’ve had some sleepless nights and tears. There were seven players who tested positive two days before the game against Chinese Taipei. Did you think it was all over at that time, or there was still hope that India could fight, if 13 players were available? Article 4.1 (of the competition rules) said you needed 13 players. We already knew early in the morning on January 22 that we had only 11 players. Then there were two more (cases). When I got the news on January 19 that seven hotel staff got infected, I understood that this is not the end of the story, it was just the beginning. It’s not rocket science to understand that if the ones who are taking care of us – hotel staff – have tested positive, even if we are in quarantine, how can you protect yourself? I understood early that this could happen and that gave me sleepless nights. If allowed, did you think India could compete with under-17 players, who were training in another bio-bubble? Even if they are not at the same level as the seniors, we can at least come to the game, show our best, try to do something. We had nine (senior) players who could have played, so with support from at least four or five young player from the under-17 bubble, we could have played the game and maybe have a chance to give Chinese Taipei a good game. Even if we had lost, that would have been much better than getting knocked out like this. That door was never opened. AFC did not allow new registrations? No. Having seen all the teams in action now, how far could have India gone? We had a realistic chance to reach the quarterfinals. What about semis? That depends where we finished, second or one of the best third-placed team. When it comes to the knockout stage, you always have a chance. The pressure is on both teams. Usually, it's harder pressure on the better teams to win. Will you continue in India beyond the under-17 World Cup later this year? In this business, you cannot employ yourself, it’s all up to the federation. My contract ends in the beginning of 2023, so we will see. The only thing i can say is I like my time here. I was also living my dream. At the press conference, you said what doesn’t kill, makes you stronger. Will the girls emerge stronger from this heartbreak? Hopefully, definitely. They are all motivated. Honestly, they are all super strong girls, working so hard and couldn’t have done it better. These have been really, really tough five and half months and there were no complaints at all. If they keep working like this and we can work with young squads like the under-15s, 17 and 19, then I promise you India will have a really good team in a couple of years.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/with-some-u-17-players-we-could-have-given-chinese-taipei-a-good-game-thomas-dennerby/articleshow/89166182.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Goa||‘Had joined BJP for devpt, not for love of party’||Panaji: Water resources minister and Velim MLA Filipe Neri Rodrigues resigned from BJP on Thursday, becoming the sixth sitting BJP MLA and the third cabinet minister to quit the Pramod Sawant-led government ahead of the assembly elections. Admitting that he is a defector, Rodrigues appeared unfazed over his political trajectory which has seen him vaulting between three political parties in less than three years. “I am a defector, I admit that,” Rodrigues said. He is one of the 10 Congress MLAs who had joined BJP in July 2019. Immediately after resigning, he joined NCP in the presence of NCP national general secretary Praful Patel. When asked about his reasons for leaving BJP, the former minister said he does not agree with BJP’s ideology. “I joined BJP to develop my constituency and not for the love of BJP or to carry their agenda forward,” Rodrigues said. “It was only because a huge section of Congress was defecting, that I became part of them. I expected all others to defect also.” Rodrigues was due to resign last week as he didn’t want to contest on BJP ticket from Velim. After scouting for candidates, BJP nominated Savio Rodrigues, a media entrepreneur. This is not the first time that the four-term legislator has walked out of BJP. Rodrigues was part of the BJP government in 2000-2002 and from 2002 to 2005 when the Parrikar government lost. In 2002, he had won as Independent. The former Velim MLA said that he has been in touch with Patel for the last two months, but had waited to make the decision as he was consulting his supporters.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/had-joined-bjp-for-devpt-not-for-love-of-party/articleshow/89166178.cms||TNN

Health minister Vishwajit Rane and his wife Deviya filed nominations as BJP candidates from Valpoi and Poriem, respectively. Similarly, another BJP couple, Panaji MLA Atanasio ‘Babush’ Monserrate and his wife revenue minister Jennifer Monserrate filed their nominations from Panaji and Taleigao, respectively. Former minister Michael Lobo and his wife Delilah filed their nominations as Congress candidates from Calangute and Siolim, respectively. Vishwajit said that his supporters are active and BJP will win the Valpoi seat. “A lot of people want to contest elections and there is no problem. People will come to know when results are out,” he said. Deviya said that she was happy because she has filed the nomination form for the first time. “Sattari has always supported Vishwajit and me. They have always stood by us and once again they will stand by us. Sattari is like our family, we are all one big family. I am getting a positive response during my campaign. My priority will be to give employment. We have to see employment in the private sector as well as the government and to complete development work.” Jennifer said that all the panchayat members and councillors are working hard for her victory. “I would like to take this opportunity to thank them from the bottom of my heart. I will not say that there is no difficulty. Every election we work hard, and every election is tough. We are working hard and working together to see that there is a victory and when you expect a victory you win with a good margin,” she said. Lobo said that a little over 15 days are left with the people of Goa before the elections. “Those who have not yet decided whom to vote for, they have to think. Most of them have decided. This government has to go, so vote for change that is Congress,” he said. Delilah said that she has completed a door-to-door campaign and she will hold corner meetings. When asked about the history that Congress has never won the Siolim seat, she said, “We have come here to create history.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/three-couples-set-for-feb-14-date/articleshow/89166218.cms||TNN
---||Goa||Sawant involved in Rs 1,686cr mining scam, alleges Cong||Panaji: State Congress president Girish Chodankar on Thursday alleged that chief minister Pramod Sawant is involved in a Rs 1,686 crore mining scam claiming they have prima facie evidence about it. “Sawant has been involved in a huge mining scam worth Rs 1,686 crore, and we are going to expose him with documents in a few days, probably when union home minister Amit Shah is here,” Chodankar told reporters at a press conference that was also attended by opposition leader Digambar Kamat. Chodankar said besides Sawant, some more cabinet ministers of the BJP government are also involved in the scam. “The ministers’ involvement will be exposed. He (Sawant) will not be able to extricate himself from it. We have prima facie evidence against him,” Chodankar said. The scam, he said, is linked to the Covid deaths. The identity of the other ministers, who according to the Congress president are involved, will also be revealed. Officials linked to the scam will be exposed, he said. Chodankar also said that the party has planned to expose the scam by timing it close to the election date with an aim to impress upon the voters how corrupt the BJP government has been, and that people were directly affected by the scam. Sawant, he said, has been “the most corrupt CM” and the people of Sakhali will defeat him. “He (Sawant) has been aware that he will be defeated, and that’s why he has used police machinery to harass the Congress candidate Dharmesh Saglani who will take on Sawant in Sakhali,” the state Congress chief said. He said FIRs have already been filed against Saglani, and challenged Sawant to file more. “Arrest Saglani if you can. We are not afraid, but Sawant is. His defeat is certain,” he said.

The case filed against Naik in the alleged sex scandal case was closed without investigation, he said.

Going by the present figures the conversion rate in private hospitals is more than that of government hospitals. While private hospitals recorded a conversion rate of 2.13% as on Tuesday, in government Covid hospitals it was less than 1 % - 0.84%. About 95% of active cases are in home quarantine and the conversion rate in secondary line treatment centres and first line treatment centres are also below 1 % in the district. Contrary to the second wave, conversion rate with regard to oxygen beds, ICU and ventilators are also below 0.5%. The conversion rate for ventilators is the lowest; 0.07%. In the Medical College Hospital of around 28 cases in ICU, only five patients in the relatively young age category have developed Covid pneumonia. Remaining persons are elderly people with comorbidities. The health officials taking care of such patients said that they have other serious ailments and Covid has emerged as an added infection. One probable challenge for the district where conversion rate towards hospitalisation has been very low even after three weeks into the third wave is that elderly people with co-morbidities could fall prey to Omicron variant. “They are a category that has remained immune to the infection in the first two waves. Probability of these people falling sick in the third wave is higher. The next two weeks will be crucial in terms of all-cause mortality. At present our biggest challenge will be to save the lives of this category that we have managed to protect in the first two waves,” a health official said. The district’s low rate of hospitalization in the first three weeks of the wave despite active cases going above 45,000 is mainly due to the manner in which infection patterns remained in plateau mode in the district for many months post the second wave. “Many people acquired infection either after the second wave or towards the fag end of the second wave. This has resulted in them gaining neutralizing antibodies which could give them an immune cover against serious nature of infections. Also high rates of vaccination could result in hybrid immunity. Having said that, all these present trends should not be mistaken for a sense of calm. The next two weeks will be crucial for the district,” the health official added. The fact that many people are opting for home care and self-testing with the belief that vaccination could give them a protective cover has also eased the burden on hospital infrastructure. Delayed arrivals, brought dead cases, death in transit are possibilities which the health team is keen on averting at any cost at present. The vacancy percentage of ventilators in private and government hospitals was 64% and 83% respectively. As for ICU, 33 beds out of 68 in the government sector were vacant till Tuesday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/conversion-rate-of-hospitalisation-at-4-95-under-home-quarantine/articleshow/89124372.cms||Aswin J Kumar

Kamat has been representing Margao constituency in the state assembly since 1994. He won his first three elections as a BJP candidate before switching to Congress in 2005. “Margao has always contributed to the overall development and progress of the state. This time Madgaonkars will play a decisive role in forming a stable Congress government in 2022,” Kamat said after filing his nomination papers. Kamat has also been critical of TMC and AAP for offering freebies to voters. “During my tenure as chief minister not a single Goan came to me asking anything for free. Goans are self-respecting people earning their living by the sweat of their brow,” Kamat said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/bring-back-govt-of-prosperity-end-govt-of-poverty-kamat/articleshow/89166229.cms||---

On Thursday, a senior BJP functionary from Ponda Sandeep Khandeparkar who has been aspiring for the party ticket, filed his nomination, creating a flutter in the BJP camp. Former chief minister Ravi Naik, who has been declared as BJP candidate, has already filed his nomination papers. This is the first time he is contesting on a BJP ticket from Ponda, a constituency that has elected him several times in the past. Khandeparkar is a senior member of the party and has a good rapport with electors in Khandepar village. Khandepar was earlier considered a stronghold of Naik, but there was dissension when the village was brought under Ponda planning development authority (PDA). Khandeparkar said the party has done injustice to him. “I was an aspiring party candidate since the past two general elections, but the party forced me to compromise both times. In 2012, the party tied-up with MGP and asked me to wait for the next election as they had to ensure the alliance candidate’s victory,” he said. “Later in 2017, the party ticket was offered to Sunil Desai and I was told to wait for the subsequent (2022) election, but they inducted Ravi Naik and offered the ticket to him,” he said. BJP Ponda block president Vishwanath Dalvi hopes that Khandeparkar will withdraw from the fray.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/goa/news/after-losing-ticket-to-ravi-naik-bjp-functionary-files-papers-in-ponda/articleshow/89172928.cms||TNN

The police identified the accused as Shamir, 21, of Pallippuram, Abin, 21, of Kadakkavoor, Akhil Preman, 20, of Vakkom, Hareesh, 19, of Chirayinkeezhu and Jernisha, 22, of Nilamel. Among the accused, Shamir and Abin are accused of stealing a vehicle and then using it to commit robbery. Akhil Preman and Hareesh are accused of modifying the stolen motorcycle beyond recognition. Jernisha is accused of helping them sell off the gold chain that was snatched. The police said the accused were held following an investigation into a case related to the robbery of gold chain of an 80-year-old woman at Angilimukku near Kadakkavoor on Saturday morning. The two accused gruesomely attacked the woman who was walking along the road before fleeing with her gold chain. The incident was caught on a surveillance camera. The duo were habitual offenders, involved in a series of similar crimes in and outside the district, including Kanyakumari district in Tamil Nadu. Hence the police could easily identify them. After they were taken into custody, the police found out that the motorcycle they used was allegedly stolen from the parking lot of Government Medical College Hospital during the early hours of Saturday. The two also revealed the involvement of others. The police have recovered the vehicle. Jernisha, who worked as an assistant manager at a private finance firm at Chalakudy, had helped them sell off the chain. The police are also probing into her financial activities. During the interrogation, the gang admitted to committing more similar crimes in the recent past. The team that arrested the accused were led by Varkala DSP P Niyas, Kadakkavoor station house officer inspector V Ajesh and sub inspectors S S Deepu and Mahin Manohar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/gang-involved-in-chain-snatching-on-stolen-bike-held/articleshow/89124385.cms||---

Sequeira along with Fernandes and Menezes had recently pledged to remain united after resigning from Congress and subsequently joining TMC after Congress inducted former BJP minister Michael Lobo and announced his candidature for Calangute. “We kept our word. We cannot speak for the person who has broken his word. Yes, it will affect us because the load on both of us will increase,” Fernandes said while speaking to reporters at Calangute on Wednesday at the launch of the TMC campaign office. “BJP will remain a communal party, no matter who joins it.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||HRC orders probe against cop for humiliating teacher||Thiruvananthapuram: The state human rights commission on Tuesday ordered a probe against a police officer who allegedly humiliated a school teacher in front of his daughter. The commission chairman Justice Antony Dominic has ordered the probe rejecting an inquiry report submitted by the City Police Commissioner in favour of the officer. The commission has also ordered to review a case registered by the Museum police against the school teacher related to the incident. The commission's order is against Riyaz Khan, sub inspector (grade) of Poojapura police station. Jackson, a teacher of St. Thomas School, Poonthura, is the petitioner. According to the petition, the incidents related to his complaint took place on April 22, 2021, in front of the Cotton Hill Government Higher Secondary School for Girls, while Jackson was waiting outside the school to pick up his daughter, who was attending higher secondary board exam. The petitioner alleged that SI Riyaz Khan and another civil police officer were on duty there as part of security cover for the electronic voting machines stored in the school ahead of the assembly election. The duo behaved rudely towards a few parents waiting outside the school. Witnessing this, Jackson intervened and questioned their attitude. But, the officers responded by verbally abusing him in front of his daughter. The officers also summoned their colleagues from Museum police station, who took the teacher to the station and booked him for obstructing the officers from discharging their duty. They also confiscated the registration certificate of his vehicle while taking him into custody. Justice Antony Dominic held in his order that the probe must be conducted by an officer of the rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police. The commission also held that a mere quarrel does not amount to obstruction of duty and hence the case registered by the Museum police has to be reviewed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/hrc-orders-probe-against-cop-for-humiliating-teacher/articleshow/89124413.cms||---

Delivering his Republic Day speech on the court premises after unfurling the Tricolour on Wednesday, the CJ said: "It is a matter of pride that our high court has six women judges. This is more than 30 per cent of the current working strength of 19 judges. This is the highest ever since this high court was established." Even in the district judiciary, out of 434 judges, 221 are women judges. "This accounts for 52 per cent," he said. "We are getting some more new judges for the high court within a month or so," the CJ said. He also said 31 new courts were set up in the state last year. Not just a record woman judge appointees in the judiciary, Telangana will also have another distinction of being the only state in the country to have filled almost all the junior civil judge posts in the district judiciary. Of 627 HC judges in India, 66 are women  Out of 237 junior civil judge posts, 227 have been filled. This was made possible with the completion of recruitment of 66 junior civil judges in October last year. Interestingly, 40 of them are women. In a PIL filed by women lawyers' organisation in Supreme Court in April 2021 seeking appointment of more women judges in courts, it was revealed that five high courts of Manipur, Meghalaya, Patna, Tripura and Uttarakhand have no single woman judge. As per information available on the website of the department of justice, out of the current working strength of 627 judges in various high courts across the country, only 66 are women which accounts for just 10 per cent of the total working strength. Faizan Mustafa, vice-chancellor of the National Academy of Legal Studies and Research, said more number of women as judges and lawmakers would help in balanced adjudication. Referring to the Kerala nun rape case, Mustafa said that male judges often do not consider a woman's perspective. "Most of the laws are made by men and lack a woman's perspective. Often we see that in rape and sexual offence cases, the line of questioning and findings exclude the woman's perspective. When a judge is passing an order, how a woman would feel about it needs to be considered," said Mustafa. He also said more women should be lawmakers. "Ideally, 50 per cent seats should be set apart for women. Unfortunately, women's reservation has never been a priority for any government. In fact, even in matters pertaining to men, women should be considered. It is the objectivity that every judge should possess," said Mustafa.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/with-30-women-judges-telangana-hc-set-an-example-cj-satish-chandra-sharma/articleshow/89144767.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

It marks Pyongyang's sixth weapons test this year, as the regime flexes its military muscles while ignoring US offers of talks.

---||World||Russia, Ukraine agree to keep ceasefire, new talks next month||PARIS: Envoys from Moscow and Kyiv on Wednesday committed to a fragile ceasefire in eastern Ukraine during talks in Paris and agreed to continue their discussions against the backdrop of warnings that Russia may be preparing to invade its neighbour. A Russian troop build-up close to the border with eastern Ukraine has raised fears the Kremlin is planning to intervene in its pro-EU neighbour to halt NATO's expansion in eastern Europe. A French diplomat said that more than eight hours of discussions brokered by France and Germany had sent a "good signal". A German government source later confirmed that the next round would take place in Berlin in the second week of February. An aide to French President Emmanuel Macron, speaking on condition of anonymity, stressed that the talks had been about resolving the separatist fighting in eastern Ukraine since 2014, not the threat of a Russian invasion. But "the question was whether the Russians wanted to signal a thaw", he said, adding that the "difficult" discussions had ultimately resulted in something positive. "In the current circumstances, we received a good signal," he said. For the first time since 2019, Ukraine and Russia agreed to sign a joint statement along with France and Germany about the ongoing conflict between Ukrainian forces and separatists in the east of the country. The four nations have been working towards reaching a peace deal for eastern Ukraine since 2014 and are known collectively as the Normandy Group. "However difficult the discussions have been since December 2019, the Normandy Group has been able to agree on several key points," the French aide said. The joint statement committed both sides to "an unconditional respect for the ceasefire" and also said that they would meet again in two weeks' time in Berlin. A 2014 ceasefire deal -- bolstered in 2020 -- helped end the worst fighting over two separatist regions in eastern Ukraine that has claimed some 13,000 lives. Western countries have been concerned that Russia could use a flare up in fighting along the front between Ukrainian soldiers and separatists as a pretext to launch an invasion of its neighbour. The Kremlin's envoy Dmitry Kozak said the main outcome of the four-way talks was the agreement on keeping the ceasefire. He said that "despite all the differences in interpretations, we agreed that the ceasefire (in eastern Ukraine) must be maintained by all the parties in line with the accords". "We need a supplementary pause," he said. "We hope that this process will have results in two weeks." He said that the Berlin talks would take place at the same level as the Paris session, adding that for the moment a summit involving heads of state was "not on the agenda". "We hope our colleagues have understood our arguments and that in two weeks we will achieve results," said Kozak, who is also the deputy head of President Vladimir Putin's administration. He insisted that the situation in the east of Ukraine -- where pro-Russia separatists have declared breakaway regions -- and the tensions along the border were "two separate issues". Ukraine's envoy Andriy Yermak, speaking to reporters separately, said that the talks were "not easy". "The support for the sustainable ceasefire is extremely important," he said, adding that there were differences over the interpretation of the Minsk Agreement which ended the worst of the fighting in 2014. "The very important thing is that today's communique is the first meaningful document we managed to agree on since December 2019" when Putin and Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky met in Paris.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/russia-ukraine-agree-to-keep-ceasefire-new-talks-next-month/articleshow/89144832.cms||---

For political parties, 2021 had been a busy year, with elections held to the state assembly and the rural local bodies in nine newly carved out districts. The election to rural local bodies in other districts was held in 2020 under the previous AIADMK regime. The outcome of the single-phase election to urban local bodies on February 19, as announced by state election commissioner V Palanikumar on Wednesday, would create a new road map for local administration. The previous AIADMK government had announced dates for local body polls in September 2016. But a series of legal tussles following petitions and counter petitions by the DMK and the AIADMK before the Madras high court and the Supreme Court delayed the process. Polls to rural local bodies were held after four years in 2020 but the urban local body polls were delayed until the high court on Tuesday gave the nod to the commission to announce the dates for polls. The announcement would drive the two Dravidian majors, its allies and other parties to work overtime to face the polls, whose outcome could boost or dent political image. Kept on the opposition bench for two successive terms since 2011, the DMK saw a resurgence after the demise of AIADMK leader J Jayalalithaa. The party not only tasted overwhelming success in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls winning 38 of the 39 seats but also extended its winning streak to 2021 assembly polls and 2021 rural local body polls. The alliance combination in the AIADMK front has changed significantly with PMK, which contested the 2021 assembly election as an ally, contested the recent rural local body polls independently. PMK is expected to go it alone again for the urban local body election. The DMDK too is out of the alliance. The DMK has managed to hold its partners together. The commission has directed the poll officials to bring all activities including filing of nominations, scrutiny of nominations, withdrawal of nominations and allotment of symbols under CCTV surveillance. The commission has published the list of polling stations in the urban local bodies on November 9 last year and January 4 this year. It has published urban local bodies electoral rolls on December 9 last year and January 10 this year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/urban-local-body-elections-tamil-nadu-parties-to-enter-poll-arena-again/articleshow/89144919.cms||---

An analysis of state health and family welfare department data as on Wednesday (January 26) shows 22 of the 28 died at home, while six others were declared dead on arrival at hospitals. Most of these victims are from North Karnataka, with Belagavi reporting six ‘at-home’ deaths, Bagalkot four, one each from Kalaburagi, Haveri and Ballari. While such fatalities were rampant during the second wave, they are gradually surfacing in the current wave too. This has led to worries among officials and the medical fraternity. Read AlsoCovid-19: Karnataka saw 21% hospitalisation during second wave, 5% in thirdCovid hospitalisation in Karnataka during the peak of the second wave stood at 21%, much more than the corresponding figure for the first wave (16%). In the third wave, 5% of the infected persons have required admission so far, shows an analysis by the health and family welfare department. TheIn Bengaluru, four patients have died at home and five were brought dead. “We plan to audit these cases,” said Dr Balasundar AS, chief health officer, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP). The 22 ‘at-home’ deaths in January so far include two people in Tumakuru who died during the second wave but were included in recent bulletins after data was reconciled with information from the districts. However, a senior officer from the health and family welfare department, said: “In some cases, patients died due to chronic illness which they had suffered for a long time, and were brought to hospitals at the last minute. Covid tests were done as a formality at the hospital. In most cases, Covid detection is incidental. That is how some of the Covid deaths are labelled at ‘died at home’ or ‘brought dead’ cases. ” Another officer pointed out, “There is no dearth of Covid beds now. We need to look into each of these cases individually. ” Read AlsoIndia reports 2.86 lakh Covid cases, 573 deaths; active caseload remains over 2.2 millionIndia reported 2.86 lakh new Covid cases, marginal increase of 0.1 per cent, while the active cases climbed to 22,02,472, according to the Union health ministry data updated on Monday.

She died on January 20 and the fatality was reflected in the state Covid bulletin two days later. “In this case, the child suffered from respiratory issues,” said Dr Vijay R Kanthi, district surveillance officer, Bagalkot. “She was admitted to a private hospital on January 13 and she was on a ventilator from then on. On January 20, the parents wanted to shift her to the district hospital, and she passed away during transit. It’s not actually a case of death at home. ” Read Also‘Comorbidity issues killed many, Covid incidental’Panaji: Detection of Covid-19 infection in majority of the fatalities since the third wave has been “incidental” as patients reported life-endangering ailments.

There were no cultural performances by school and college students either. Kamarajar Salai along Chennai’s famous Marina beach, which normally brims with school and college students and the public witnessing the ceremonial march past and cultural performances, was on Wednesday filled with only government officials, ministers, dignitaries from consulates and their families. The focus was on the tableaux of freedom fighters that was rejected by the Union government. Pictures of the tableaux featuring V O Chidambaram, Subramania Bharati and Velu Nachiyar, the first queen to have fought the British riding a horse with a sword, were widely shared on social media. Chief Minister M K Stalin later flagged off the tableau that were be taken to important cities in the state after the event in Chennai. “The first voice in social emancipation and national emancipation was from Tamil Nadu. Tableau with statues of Tamil Nadu freedom fighters may be barred from appearing in the Republic day parade in New Delhi. But today they (tableau) carry our history all over Tamil Nadu. No one can change or hide our history,” Stalin said later. A contingent of the armed forces during a march drillGovernor R N Ravi unfurled the National Flag at 8am, following which a helicopter of the Indian Air Force showered flower petals and kickstarted the ceremonial march past by various uniformed contingents including the Armed forces, CRPF, Tamil Nadu Special police and Chennai city police among others. Stalin presented several awards including Anna Medal for Gallantry, notably to city inspector E Rajeswari who rescued a cemetery worker by lifting him on her shoulders to rush him to a hospital and Thiruvottiyur ward councillor Thaniyarasu who told residents to vacate their dilapidated building minutes before it came crashing down. An Air Force chopper showers flowers near Gandhi statue“Let us reaffirm to uphold the secular ethos of the Constitution on this Republic Day and be proud of the great achievements to uplift people of our nation in all spheres,” the chief minister said in a statement. The Kottai Ameer award for Communal Harmony was given to J Mohammed Rafi of Coimbatore and C Narayanasamy Naidu award for highest yield in the state went to C Ramasamy of Salem. Gandhi Adigal Police medals to personnel informed in curbing illicit liquor was given to five officers and the CM’s trophy for the best police station went to Tirupur (south). Cop who carried man to safety feted:City police inspector E Rajeswari, who rescued a wounded, unconscious man at Kilpauk cemetery and carried him on her shoulder was awarded the Anna Medal for gallantry this year. The award carries a cheque of Rs 1 lakh, a medal and a certificate. The cop’s efforts were appreciated by the general public after a video of her carrying the worker went viral. Her colleagues point out that she is someone who has been consistent with her efforts for public service. She once rescued Ganesh, a painter who was trapped inside a dilapidated house, while patrolling during cyclone Nivar in 2020 in Otteri area of Chennai. She was also instrumental in reuniting a differentlyabled boy, Palani, who went missing in Otteri during the cyclone. “Frankly, I never thought I will get this medal. I am glad to have found a place in the hearts of public,” E Rajeswari told TOI. Honour for saving lives of residents:TM Thaniyarasu, a former councillor and current DMK area secretary , was awarded the Anna medal for gallantry for his efforts to save lives of residents. Residents of a four-storeyed apartment of the Tamil Nadu Urban Habitat Development Board had a miraculous escape on the morning of December 27, 2021, as it came crashing just minutes after they walked out fearing for their safety as the apartment walls had developed cracks. The tenement had 24 flats that housed 80 people. Some of them had moved to the homes of friends and relatives. The rest spent an uneasy night in their homes, with bits of plaster falling and the building giving up gradually. Around 9.45am on December 27, Thaniyarasu had arrived to videograph the state of the building, but when he saw its condition, he insisted that everyone in the building leave immediately. “I never expected it,” Thaniyarasu told ToI, on getting the award. Forest surgeon awarded for bravery:Forest veterinary assistant surgeon Dr K Asokan, who was awarded the Anna medal for bravery, was part of a team to secure wild elephant Chinnathambi in Chinnathadam forest area in 2019. A search was on for the wild elephant after it broke into a residential area. While the team secured the elephant by administering tranquilizers on January 25, 2019, the elephant escaped and travelled 100 km to Udumalpet and Kannadipudur residential areas and hid in sugarcane fields, destroying standing crops. After obtaining orders from the Madras high couurt, a team was formed under the leadership of Dr K Asokan for securing the elephant without harming it. Despite the risk to his life,Asokan fired the tranquilizer dart at the elephant on February 15, 2019. The elephant was later moved to a tiger reserve and was trained to become a captive elephant. Asokan’s efforts were appreciated by the court itself.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/tamil-nadu-rallies-its-heroes-to-salute-the-republic/articleshow/89144985.cms||Srikkanth D

Since the second half of 2020, International Spirits and Wines Association of India (ISWAI) has been lobbying for home delivery of alcohol. It has cited studies it conducted involving consumers and even quoted examples of other major states like Maharashtra, West Bengal and Assam, besides others, which have gone down this route. “However, in Karnataka and specially in Bengaluru, the IT-BT capital of the nation and the Silicon Valley of India, the government is yet to consider this option. We believe that allowing home delivery will help the hospitality sector that has been suffering losses due to Covid-19,” said Nita Kapoor, CEO, ISWAI. The association said it is continuously in touch with the government and is trying to convince the powers that be of the advantages of the idea. However, excise minister K Gopalaiah claimed no such appeal has been made to him nor has any such demand been submitted to the ministry. “The government is open to any constructive suggestions from the industry, but it has to be within a reasonable framework of ensuring that people who are dependent on liquor licences do not lose their jobs,” the minister said. Gopalaiah, elaborating on the fear that his department and the government has, said that any decision to allow home delivery of alcohol could result in big retail chains and those with deep pockets dominating the market. “It is the same logic which hurt mom and pop stores when e-commerce made its entry,” Gopalaiah said. “If the home delivery system is put in place, then where will those small MRP shops, which are purely dependent on in-store sales, go?” But Kapoor pointed out that the e-commerce market and the liquor market are completely different in the sense that one is a free market while the other is controlled by the state. “Unlike e-commerce where deep discounts have hurt small shops, the liquor market is controlled by the state government and cannot be manipulated,” Kapoor said. Kapoor said the West Bengal excise department has introduced a model whereby contact details of registered alcohol outlets in an area are put up on their website and customers can call the nearest liquor store to deliver it to them. Gopalaiah implied the state does not have to resort to such a measure when he revealed that the excise department has already collected Rs 20,800 crore in revenue and is well on its way to achievin g the Rs 22,700 crore target set for the fiscal. However, the excise minister said he will discuss further reforms with chief minister Basavaraj Bommai before taking decisions on implementation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/karnataka-resists-calls-to-allow-home-delivery-of-liquor/articleshow/89145067.cms||Sandeep Moudgal
---||Chennai||Man who could make the guitar sing and dance in Tamil Nadu||Vamanan CHENNAI: The passing of film music guitarist S Phillips last Friday at the age of 88 brings down the curtain on a golden era of light Tamil film songs that had begun in the early 1960s. One of the characteristics of this renaissance was the importance given to the orchestral richness of songs in keeping with their mood, melody and meaning. And instrumentalists like Phillips played a key role in what turned out to be evergreen classics in Tamil film songs. In the peppy number “Avalukkenna, Azhagiya Mugam” in AVM’s classic ‘Server Sundaram’, which is iconic for its visual presentation of a staging of the recording of the song as part of its picturisation, the handsome Phillips strumming an unforgettable solo on his guitar stood out against the ever soaring brass section weaving a rich tapestry of sonorous strains after the refrain. This natural talent’s tryst with music began by accident through his elder brothers who were in the Indian Army. Posted at the Civil Internment camp at Deolali, 160km northeast of Bombay, the brothers were entranced by the guitar playing of Italian prisoners of war at the camp and took to the instrument. When they came home on leave, they brought their instrument, leaving it behind for Phillips to explore. ‘Blood and Sand’, the lavish 1941 technicolor film about a matador who meets his downfall through a sultry guitar-strumming siren played by Rita Hayworth, bowled over Phillips and he became solely devoted to the instrument, bent on making it sing and dance in all the ways it did in the musical score of the film. This obsession shut the doors of school for him, but opened the gates of Gemini Studio. It was S Rajeswara Rao, the veteran music composer with an ear for innovation who spotted Phillips’ vibrant playing and inducted him into film music when he was about 15. Subsequent to a month-long initiation, Phillips struck a friendship with another seminal composer K V Mahadevan, who was then working as a music composer with HMV. “Every day he would share his lunch with me,” Phillips had remembered warmly. At HMV, Phillips met M S Viswanathan when the latter came to the company to record his film songs again for gramophone records. KVM recommended Phillips as a good guitarist to MSV though the latter was hesitant to accept the teenager. The assurance and elan that Phillips exhibited as a youngster stood him in good stead during his nearly 12-year collaboration with the Viswanathan-Ramamurthy duo and then with MSV till 1967. In Kannadasan’s production ‘Karuppupanam’, Phillips’ seductive playing for “Aadavaralaam”, adds to the ambience of Bacchanalian revelry evoked by the ‘club’ song. One of his last recordings for MSV was for the song “Varavu Ettana Selavu Pathana” in K Balachander’s ‘Bama Vijayam’. In the thematic song which underscores the value of thrift and the dangers of ostentatious spending, the lilting guitar strains in the interludes add a vivid interest to the song. He also directed music for a few films such as ‘Karunthel Kannayiram’. But it is his vibrant solos in hundreds of songs that serve as a benchmark of excellence.

---||Chennai||In the age of the hero was born South India’s first dream girl||CHENNAI: Pre-independence, when films meant stories from mythology and epics, stars were male leads with long monologues and the roles for women were usually that of the sacrificing mother. Into this scene came T R Rajakumari. Described as the first female superstar of the 1940s, Rajakumari regaled audiences with her performances in several Tamil films including ‘Haridas’ and ‘Chandralekha’ which were supergrossers at the box-office, as she could sing, dance and emote with elan in a magical combination of sensuality and talent. Reviewing her third film ‘Kacha Devayani’ (1941), which was first big success, veteran film historian Randor Guy said Rajakumari’s looks stunned filmgoers who were bowled over by the dusky beauty. But the colour of her skin was almost a reason for her not getting noticed. Thanjavur Ranganayaki Rajayee was born in a well-known Thanjavur family that was deeply rooted in fine arts. Her grandmother, Thanjavur Kuchalambal, was a classical Carnatic musician and trained Rajayee to become a Carnatic musician. But with her aunt, S P L Dhanalakshmi in the movies, some of her family members pushed her into acting. The American filmmaker Ellis Dungan was approached, but he could then offer no more than a role of a comedian, which Rajayee politely refused. She got to act in ‘Kumara Kulothangan’ which took a few years in the making, but was released only in 1941 after the release of ‘Kacha Devayani’ (1941). In her first film, as is common practice, her name was changed to make it more suitable for the screen. She became T R Rajalakshmi, which was later changed to T R Rajakumari. Her first few films were by chance. Film director K Subramaniam happened to call on her aunt Dhanalakshmi, and was enamoured by the girl who served him coffee. When he sought a make-up test for Rajayee, his make-up man felt she was too dark for films, but Subramaniam had his way and cast her in ‘Kacha Devayani’ which went on to be a super hit, running for more than 25 weeks. It is said that the film opened to empty houses, but soon word spread about the stunning beauty. Thousands of men were bewitched by her sensuality and be gan watching her film several times. In 1942, she had another hit, ‘Manonmani’ for Modern Theatres with top star P U Chinnappa. Moviegoers loved watching the PUC-Rajakumari pair as they went on to make successful films. In 1943 and 1944, she paired up with M K Tyagaraja Bhagavathar for ‘Sivakavi’ and ‘Haridas’, which became box-office hits. In ‘Sivakavi’, Rajakumari had the minor role of court dancer-poet Vanji who falls for the hero, while in ‘Haridas’, Rajakumari played the daring role of a scheming vamp who seduced the hero (Bhagavathar) only to destroy him. The combination of MKT-Rajakumari and director Sundar Rao Nadkarni proved irresistible for filmgoers. Many scenes in ‘Haridas’ between MKT and Rajakumari were considered daring and intimate and some puritans even said they were vulgar. In the 1940s, the British censors were only against political state ments, but were liberal when it came to erotic scenes. She became every man’s fantasy. Rajakumari’s dance in the famous song “Manmadha Leelaiyai Venraar Undo” from the film ‘Haridas’ was particularly remembered for Rajakumari’s flying kiss, which was aimed at the lead MKT, but most of the male audience believed the kiss was meant for them. Such was the spell that she cast on them. While dishing out the box office successes with established co-stars, Rajakumari began to draw audiences in her own right. After a few more hits with P U Chinnappa -- ‘Pankajavalli’ and ‘Krishna Bhakti’ -- S S Vasan cast her in ‘Chandralekha’, which enabled Rajakumari to scale new heights through its Tamil and Hindi versions. Her songs, costumes, trapeze act and the famous drum-dance provided her eternal fame as the drumdance would be talked about forever. The movie ‘Chandralekha’ (1948) broke several records and was screened worldwide in film festivals. Her vampish role in ‘Manohara’ (Sivaji Ganesan starrer) again established her as a brilliant actor. Not content with singing and acting, she added another feather to her cap with film production, joining hands with her younger brother T R Ramachandran, fondly known as Ramanna, to form RR Pictures. They produced films like ‘Vaazha Pirandhaval’ (1953), ‘Gul-E-Bakawali’ (1955) and ‘Panam Padaithavan’ (1965). Their most notable film was ‘Koondukkili’ in 1954 where they had pulled off a casting coup, the only film in which MGR and Sivaji had acted together. The film failed at the box-office during the first release but had a good collection when re-released after both MGR and Sivaji became big stars. Never one to settle, Rajakumari’s next daring venture was to build a theatre at Pondy Bazaar in T Nagar. The Rajakumari theatre was inaugurated by S S Vasan. In those days, it was considered a prestigious theatre since it had airconditioning and screened many English films. Later, she had to sell the theatre, and it changed several hands and at the site now stands a big departmental store. Her last film was ‘Vaanambadi’ in 1963, after which she cut herself off from the film world. The woman who brought oomph to south Indian movies turned spiritual in her last days. She died on September 20, 1999, at the age of 77. In Chennai, old-timers would recall a red Plymouth car (said to belong to Rajakumari) being rented out for ‘jaanavaasams’ (short drive in the car to a temple on the eve of the wedding to “display” the bridegroom) as an open car without the roof. That was among the last visible remnants of the style and opulence that Rajakumari embodied.

As her pleas to admit her fell on deaf ears, the family of Nimalla Lalamma waited outside the hospital gate where the woman gave birth to a baby girl on Tuesday. Health minister T Harish Rao took a serious view of the incident, following which superintendent of the area hospital and a doctor were suspended on Wednesday. Lalamma of Banala in Balmoor mandal came to the hospital for delivery of her third baby on Tuesday morning. The doctors examined her. When they found that her Covid-19 test was positive, they referred her to the government hospital at Nagarkurnool. However, no ambulance was arranged to take her there. Within 40 minutes, Lalamma started complaining of labour pains. With siblings' assistance, Lalamma delivered the baby in the open area near the hospital gate. When the hospital staff saw this, they got her inside and provided her a room. Lalamma's sister Alivelu complained that they felt neglected by the hospital staff despite the fact that she began having strong laour pains. Meanwhile, commissioner, Telangana Vaidya Vidhana Parishad, has issued orders suspending superintendent of the hospital Dr Krishna and duty doctor Hari Babu. "Clear instructions have been issued to all the government hospitals not to deny admission to pregnant women even if they were Covid-19 positive. The incident is an act of gross negligence and violation of rules by the staff concerned," the commissioner said. Superintendent of the district headquarters hospital, Nagarkurnool, has been asked to conduct a detailed enquiry and submit a report.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/2-suspended-as-hospital-turns-away-positive-pregnant-woman/articleshow/89145280.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

Results of the January 1-26 challenge will be out in a week. The 62-year-old minister speaks to Komal Gautham about his passion for fitness and the health infrastructure post Covid. You have run more than 390km in the last 26 days and have several mentions in record books. How did this passion for running begin?In 1995 I was diagnosed with diabetes and began walking 2km-5km every evening. In 2004, I met with an accident and doctor told me I would never be able to run or sit on the floor. I took part in my first marathon, in Pondicherry in 2014, completing the 21.1km run in 2.34 hours. I have participated in 133 marathons so far and have entered the Asia Book of World Records and World Records Union Book for the most number of marathons run by a person of my age. During the pandemic, there has been an increased awareness on fitness. How important is it to stay fit?I can see the changes in me as a person. I feel like a 32-yearold even though I am 62. I don’t wake up with aches and pains anymore. Running for me is like breathing now... TN’s health infrastructure has always been good. What projects will you focus on post-Covid?We want to ensure government hospitals can treat all diseases and become multi-specialty hospitals on a par with private hospitals. Amma Clinics didn’t serve any purpose, but those doctors are now helping us in Makkalai Thedi Maruthivan in which more than 46 lakh people have been screened. We will improve healthcare in non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and try to have separate wings for each care. While the vaccine coverage has been high, many frontline workers are yet to be vaccinated.We are holding mega vaccination camps, door-to-door camps and booster dose camps. No state or country has achieved 100% vaccination due to the hesitancy. We are helpless when some people refuse to take the jab despite constant counselling and pressure. However, we have more than 91% in first dose and 61% in second dose. What is the status of the genome lab?It is mainly for surveillance purpose and to study the new variants. Over a period of time, we will continue to study the variations in the virus and help in better policy decisions. What is the experts’ view about the pandemic?Experts say we need to live with these viruses. We will focus on preparing our infrastructure for it.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/at-62-i-feel-like-32-dont-wake-up-with-aches-pains-anymore-says-tamil-nadu-health-minister-ma-subramanian/articleshow/89145490.cms||Komal Gautham

Named All India Federation for Social Justice, the forum would have leaders of depressed classes from all states. "This federation will provide prompt suggestions for all states to adhere to and laws related to social justice," Stalin said at a virtual conference on 'Taking forward the fight for social justice and frame a national action plan' on Wednesday.  Stalin said the percentage of backward, oppressed communities may differ with each state. The ideology of social justice is, however, the same. "Everything for everyone will be the basis for this federation. This will be a federation that works to achieve the principles of federalism," Stalin said in his concluding remarks, calling upon the participants to meet often and uphold social justice.  The conference was organised by a group of outfits, including the All India Backward Classes Federation. The participants included Maharashtra food minister Chhagan Chandrakant, Andhra Pradesh education minister Audimulapu Suresh, DMK MP P Wilson, Trinamool Congress MP Derek O'Brien, Bihar leader of opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, Dravidar Kazhagam president K Veeramani Rashtriya Janata Dal MP Manoj Kumar jha, Muslim League (Kerala) MP E T Mohamed Basheer, former chief justice of Allahabad high court Veerendra Singh and justice V Eswaraiah.  Stalin said the primary objective of the Dravidian movement was social justice and women empowerment. "We are going to commence work to achieve these goals not just in Tamil Nadu but across India," he said.  Responding to speakers at the conference who lauded his role in obtaining 27% reservation for OBCs in medical courses, Stalin said some sections were campaigning that it was the BJP which granted this reservation.  "They are not aware of the truth. DMK filed a case in the Supreme Court in May 2020. The BJP government agreed to the reservation only in July 2021. They cannot hide this truth," Stalin said, listing out the efforts taken by his party in getting the reservation for OBCs.  Stalin said the DMK's task of social justice has not ended with this one case. "Social justice is social equality, which is not restricted to education and employment but in al; spheres," he said. Quoting Amartya Sen, he said wherever injustice prevailed, justice has to be established. "The Dravidian movement is struggling to establish such a justice," said Stalin.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/tamil-nadu-cm-m-k-stalin-to-launch-national-forum-for-social-justice/articleshow/89145807.cms||Mayilvaganan

The electric carmaker, which scored an 87 percent jump in auto deliveries last year in spite of the global semiconductor shortage, reported a 71 percent rise in revenues to $53.8 billion. But Tesla said it saw no immediate relief from supply chain woes that have hit activity "for several quarters," it said. "We plan to grow our manufacturing capacity as quickly as possible," it said in a news release that reiterated the company's target of 50 percent annual growth. "The rate of growth will depend on our equipment capacity, operational efficiency and the capacity and stability of the supply chain," Tesla said. "Our own factories have been running below capacity for several quarters as supply chain became the main limiting factor, which is likely to continue through 2022." Musk said he was heartened by announced new semiconductor capacity that should alleviate the imbalance by the end of 2022 or early 2023. But "there could be other issues" that surface this year, he said during a conference call with analysts and investors. Musk cited the supply chain issues as a factor in a decision to defer rollouts of new products this year, adding that the company will do engineering of its "Cybertruck" electric pickup with an eye towards a possible launch in 2023. "The fundamental focus of Tesla is scaling vehicles," Musk said, adding that had the company introduced new models in 2021, it would have resulted in lower overall production. Musk has previously also discussed introducing a $25,000 electric vehicle, but said that product too was not on the front burner. "We have too much on our plate," Musk said. In the most recent quarter, Tesla scored a $2.3 billion profit, up more than eight times the year-ago level as revenues jumped 65 percent to $17.7 billion. Tesla has been ramping up production at factories in California and Shanghai, while also building new facilities in Germany and Texas. Tesla said it began building Model Y vehicles in Texas in late 2021, while it started equipment testing in Germany around the same time. "We are still in the process of finalizing the manufacturing permit from local authorities" in Germany, Tesla said. Musk said he is looking at adding more manufacturing locations, with further announcements likely in late 2022. CFRA Research analyst Garrett Nelson characterized the company's cautious remarks on supply chains as unalarming. "Tesla has become masterful at underpromising and overdelivering and has now beat (expectations) in nine of the past 10 quarters," Nelson wrote. "We reiterate a 'Buy' opinion." Shares of Tesla gained 0.8 percent to $944.50 in after-hours trading.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tesla-reports-record-profit-sees-more-supply-chain-woes-in-2022/articleshow/89145828.cms||---

From Thursday, face coverings are no longer required by law anywhere in England, and a legal requirement for Covid passes for entry into nightclubs and other large venues has been scrapped. The government last week dropped its advice for people to work from home as well as guidance for face coverings in classrooms. The so-called "Plan B" measures were introduced in early December to stop the rapid spread of the Omicron variant from overwhelming health services and to buy time for the population to get its booster vaccine shot. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the government's vaccine rollout, testing and development of antiviral treatments combine to make "some of the strongest defences in Europe", allowing a "cautious return" to normalcy. But he added that "as we learn to live with Covid, we need to be clear-eyed that this virus is not going away". While infections continue to fall, health officials said that Omicron remained prevalent across the country, especially among children and the elderly. Officials said almost 84 per cent of people over 12 years old in the UK have had their second vaccine dose, and that of those eligible, 81 per cent have received their booster shot. Hospital admissions and the number of people in intensive care units have stabilised or fallen, and daily cases have fallen from a peak of over 200,000 cases a day around New Year to under 100,000 in recent days. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said last week that the surge of Omicron infections "has now peaked nationally". As the government moved away from legal measures, some shops and public transport operators say they will continue to ask people to don their face masks. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said face coverings will still be required on the capital's buses and subway trains. The legal requirement for those infected to self-isolate for five full days remains, but Johnson said that measure will also end soon, to be replaced with advice and guidance for those infected to be cautious. Health officials have said they are planning a longer-term, post-pandemic strategy that treats Covid-19 more like the flu. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, which make their own public health rules, have similarly relaxed their virus restrictions.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/england-lifts-covid-restrictions-as-omicron-threat-recedes/articleshow/89145914.cms||---

The world's biggest smartphone maker said its operating profit rose to 13.87 trillion won ($11.55 billion) for the October-December period in 2021, up from nine trillion won in the same quarter the previous year. Thanks to high memory chip prices and strong consumer demand, Samsung had its highest annual sales of 279.6 trillion won in 2021, an 18 percent jump from a year earlier, the company said in a regulatory filing. Samsung achieved "record sales thanks to competitive products, despite continuing uncertainty," the tech giant said in a statement, singling out solid demand for its premium smartphone lines. While the Covid-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc on the global economy, it has helped many tech companies boom. Pandemic-driven working from home has boosted demand for devices powered by Samsung's chips, as well as home appliances such as televisions and washing machines. The world's biggest memory chip maker, Samsung Electronics has aggressively stepped up investment in its semiconductor business as the world battles chip shortages that have hit everything from cars and home appliances to smartphones and gaming consoles. The global chip supply shortage is expected to persist well into the new year, analysts have said. "In the Memory Business, demand is expected to grow as enterprises ramp up IT investments while the Company will expand supply of high-performance products," Samsung said. In November Samsung announced a new microchip factory in Texas, a $17 billion investment. The plant is expected to be operational by the end of 2024. Samsung is also investing in the development of advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence and robotics, as well as 5G and 6G communications. Park Sung-soon, an analyst at Cape Investment & Securities, said that memory chip prices were likely to decline in the first half of 2022. "Samsung's profit is likely to dip for the January-June period. But we also expect chip prices to turn around in the second half, giving a boost to company profits," he said. "We had forecast around a 10 percent fall in chip prices in the first months of 2022 but it appears now that the decline scope will be smaller with solid demands for PCs and improved supply chains." Consumer demand for high-end products, such as foldable phones, also helped to further boost profits around the holiday season. Samsung said it expected the smartphone and premium television market to grow in the third year of the pandemic, though it anticipated sustained "uncertainties triggered by COVID 19 and supply and logistics issues". Operating profits generated from Samsung's semiconductor business accounted for over 63.7 percent of the Q4 total, illustrating the major role the division plays in the sprawling group. Samsung's operating profit from the semiconductor division stood at 8.8 trillion won for the October-December period. Samsung Electronics is the flagship subsidiary of the giant Samsung group, by far the largest of the family-controlled empires known as chaebols that dominate business in South Korea. The conglomerate's overall turnover is equivalent to around one-fifth of South Korea's gross domestic product. Samsung Electronics' record sales last year came as Lee Jae-yong, the firm's vice-chairman and the de facto leader of the wider Samsung conglomerate, returned to management on parole release from prison last August. Lee had spent over half of a two and a half year sentence for bribery, embezzlement and other offences in connection with a corruption scandal that brought down ex-South Korean president Park Geun-hye before his release. His return to management has eased concerns over decision-making at Samsung.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/samsung-reports-53-jump-in-profit-despite-supply-chain-woes/articleshow/89145923.cms||---
---||World||Fighting Taliban and mistrust, Pakistan marks one year polio-free||MARDAN, Pakistan: Bathed in crisp morning light, Sidra Hussain grips a cooler stacked with glistening vials of polio vaccine in northwest Pakistan. Watching over Hussain and her partner, a policeman unslings his rifle and eyes the horizon. In concert they begin their task -- going door-to-door on the outskirts of Mardan city, dripping bitter doses of rose-coloured medicine into infants' mouths on the eve of a major milestone for the nation's anti-polio drive. The last infection of the wild poliovirus was recorded on January 27, 2021, according to officials, and Friday marks the first time in Pakistan's history that a year has passed with no new cases. To formally eradicate the disease, a nation must be polio-free for three consecutive years -- but even 12 months is a long time in a country where vaccination teams are in the crosshairs of a simmering insurgency. Since the Taliban takeover of neighbouring Afghanistan, the Pakistan version of the movement has become emboldened and its fighters frequently target polio teams. "Life or death is in God's hands," Hussain told AFP this week, amid a patchwork of high-walled compounds in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. "We have to come," she said defiantly. "We can't just turn back because it's difficult." Nigeria officially eradicated wild polio in 2020, leaving Pakistan and Afghanistan as the only countries where the disease -- which causes crippling paralysis -- is still endemic. Spread through faeces and saliva, the virus has historically thrived in the blurred borderlands between the South Asian nations, where state infrastructure is weak and the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) have carved out a home. A separate group sharing common heritage with the Afghan Taliban, the TTP was founded in 2007 and once held sway over large swathes of the restive tribal tracts of Pakistan. In 2014 it was largely ousted by an army offensive, its fighters retreating across the porous border with Afghanistan. But last year overall militant attacks surged by 56 per cent according to the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies, reversing a six-year downward trend. The largest number of assaults came in August, coinciding with the Taliban takeover of Kabul. Pakistan's newspapers are regularly peppered with stories of police slain as they guard polio teams -- and just this week a constable was gunned down in Kohat -- 80 kilometres (50 miles) southwest of Mardan. Pakistani media has reported as many as 70 polio workers killed in militant attacks since 2012 -- mostly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Still, a TTP spokesman told AFP it "never attacked any polio workers", and that security forces were their target. "They will be targeted wherever they perform their duties," he said Mardan deputy commissioner Habib Ullah Arif admits polio teams are "a very soft target", but says the fight to eradicate the disease is entwined with the security threat. "There is only one concept: we are going to defeat polio, we are going to defeat militancy," he pledged. Pakistan anti-polio drives have been running since 1994, with up to 260,000 vaccinators staging regular waves of regional inoculation campaigns. But on the fringes of the country, the teams often face scepticism. "In certain areas of Pakistan, it was considered as a Western conspiracy," explained Shahzad Baig -- head of the national polio eradication programme. The theories ranged wildly: polio teams are spies, the vaccines cause infertility, or contain pig fat forbidden by Islam. The spy theory gained currency with the killing of Osama bin Laden in 2011, whose hideaway in Abbottabad was revealed to the United States -- unwittingly or otherwise -- by a vaccine programme run by a Pakistani doctor. "It's a complex situation," said Baig. "It's socio-economical, it's political." The porous border with Afghanistan -- a strategic crutch for the TTP -- can also keep polio circulating. "For the virus, Pakistan and Afghanistan were one country," said Baig. In Mardan, 10 teams -- each comprising two women and an armed police guard -- fan out across the city's suburbs as morning turns to afternoon. The teams chalk dates on the homes they visit and smear children's fingers with indelible ink to mark those already inoculated. On Monday they delivered dozens more doses to add to the nationwide tally. "We have the fear in mind, but we have to be active to serve our nation," said polio worker Zeb-un-Nissa. "We have to eradicate this disease."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/fighting-taliban-and-mistrust-pakistan-marks-one-year-polio-free/articleshow/89146003.cms||---
---||World||Thai cleanup underway after oil spill off eastern coast||BANGKOK: Thailand mobilised its navy and other agencies on Wednesday to contain an oil spill after an estimated 160,000 litres (35,195 gallons) leaked from an undersea pipeline about 20 km (12.4 miles) off its industrialised eastern seaboard. The leak at the pipeline owned by Star Petroleum Refining Public Company Limited started late on Tuesday, southeast of the Map Ta Phut Industrial estate, a major petrochemical complex, said Atthapol Charoenchansa, director-general of the Pollution Control Department. Attapol warned fishermen to steer clear of the area but said the oil spill should be contained before it reaches the coast. He earlier said Koh Samet, a resort island off Rayong province popular with foreign tourists, could be impacted by Friday, but has since revised the threat level. SPRC's stock price plunged as much as 8.6% in early morning trade after news of the oil spill. Sophon Thongdee, Director-General of the Department of Marine and Coastal Resource, told ThaiPBS the cleanup should conclude on Thursday and there was no major damage to marine life or habitat. However, experts would be dispatched to carry out further assessment, he said. SPRC in a statement said the leakage was under control and only 20,000 litres of oil remained in the water. The company also said that the leakage had not impacted refinery operation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/thai-cleanup-underway-after-oil-spill-off-eastern-coast/articleshow/89146068.cms||---
---||World||North Korea fires 2 suspected missiles in 6th launch in 2022||SEOUL: North Korea on Thursday fired two suspected ballistic missiles into the sea in its sixth round of weapons launches this month, South Korea's military said.  South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said the weapons, which were likely short-range, were launched from an eastern coastal area, but it didn't immediately say how far they flew.  North Korea has upped its testing activity recently in an apparent effort to pressure the Biden administration amid long-stalled nuclear talks.  The renewed pressure comes as the pandemic further shakes the North's economy, which was already battered by crippling US-led sanctions over its nuclear weapons program and decades of mismanagement by its own government.  The North last week issued a veiled threat to resume the testing of nuclear explosives and long-range missiles targeting the American homeland, which leader Kim Jong Un suspended in 2018 while initiating diplomacy with the United States.  Kim's high-stakes summitry with former President Donald Trump derailed in 2019 due to disagreements over sanctions relief and denuclearization.  Some experts say North Korea could dramatically escalate weapons demonstrations after the Winter Olympics, which begin Feb. 4 in China, the North's main ally and economic lifeline.  They say Pyongyang's leadership likely feels it could use a dramatic provocation to move the needle with the Biden administration, which has been preoccupied with bigger adversaries including China and Russia.  The Biden administration has offered open-ended talks but showed no willingness to ease sanctions unless Kim takes real steps to abandon the nuclear weapons and missiles he sees as his strongest guarantee of survival.  The North has been ramping up its testing activity since last fall, demonstrating various missiles and delivery systems apparently designed to overwhelm missile defense systems in the region.  Experts say Kim is trying to apply more pressure on rivals Washington and Seoul to accept it as a nuclear power in hopes of winning relief from economic sanctions and convert the diplomacy with Washington into mutual arms-reduction negotiations.  Thursday's launch came two days after South Korea's military detected the North flight-testing two suspected cruise missile at an unspecified inland area.  North Korea opened 2022 with a pair of test-firings of a purported hypersonic missile, which Kim described as an asset that would remarkably bolster his nuclear "war deterrent."  The North also this month test-fired two different types of short-range ballistic missiles it has developed since 2019 that are designed to be maneuverable and fly at low altitudes, which experts say potentially improve their chances of evading and defeating missile defense systems.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/north-korea-fires-2-suspected-missiles-in-6th-launch-in-2022/articleshow/89146132.cms||---
---||World||British, Australian ships deliver 'contactless' aid to Tonga||CANBERRA: British and Australian navy ships arrived in Tonga on Wednesday and attempted to deliver aid without making contact with anybody ashore to avoid spreading the coronavirus in a nation which has never had an outbreak. The danger of spreading the disease was underscored when nearly two dozen sailors aboard the Australian ship HMAS Adelaide were reported infected on Tuesday, raising fears they could bring the coronavirus to the small Pacific archipelago devastated by an undersea volcanic eruption and a tsunami on Jan. 15. Since the pandemic began, Tonga has reported just a single case of Covid-19. It’s one of the few countries in the world currently completely virus free. About 61% of Tongans are fully vaccinated, according to Our World in Data. Meanwhile, the US announced it would provide an additional $2.5 million in humanitarian assistance to Tonga through the US Agency for International Development. The aid was in addition to an initial pledge of $100,000. Britain said its ship the HMS Spey arrived with 30,000 liters (7,900 gallons) of bottled water, medical supplies for more than 300 first aid kits, and basic sanitation products. It said none of its sailors disembarked the ship, and instead moved the supplies ashore by crane. “The UK is a long-standing partner of the Pacific islands, and having the ship deployed in the Indo-Pacific meant that we could be there for Tonga in their hour of need, as the island begins to rebuild their homes and communities,” said the Minister for the Armed Forces James Heappey in a statement. The Australian government said its ship had completed the 3,300-kilometer (2,050-mile) voyage from Brisbane and would deliver supplies without contact with the local population to avoid infections. “We appreciate the decision of the government of Tonga to enable HMAS Adelaide to dock and offload the humanitarian and medical supplies, and the high priority it has placed on Covid safety throughout the recovery process,” the statement said. “The ship is undertaking an entirely contactless delivery of humanitarian assistance and disaster relief supplies.” With restoration of the drinking water supply a major priority, the ship brings a desalination plant. It’s also carrying helicopters and engineering equipment. Australia said it was widening its disaster support to include restoration of power and communications. Under pandemic measures, Tonga typically requires visitors to quarantine for three weeks on arrival and that complicates the international disaster response. All international aid is to be delivered without local contact. Tongan authorities have been wary that accepting international aid could usher in a bigger disaster than the huge eruption of the volcano. The tsunami killed three people. The ship is the second aid mission from Australia in which at least one crew member tested positive. A C-17 Globemaster military transport plane was earlier turned around midflight after a person aboard was diagnosed with the coronavirus.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/british-australian-ships-deliver-contactless-aid-to-tonga/articleshow/89146139.cms||---
---||Business||US stocks fall, yields rise after Fed signals rate hike 'soon'||NEW YORK: An early rally on Wall Street gave way to a broad slide for stocks and a surge in bond yields Wednesday after the Federal Reserve signaled it plans to begin raising interest rates "soon" to fight a spike in inflation that the central bank says is probably getting worse. The S&P 500 fell 0.1% after having been up 2.2% earlier in the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4% after swinging more than 900 points from its high for the day. The Nasdaq ended little changed, shedding most of a 3.4% gain. Bond yields rose, including the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which climbed to 1.87% from 1.78% late Tuesday. Yields affect rates on mortgages and other consumer loans. In a statement issued after its latest policy meeting, the Fed said it "expects it will soon be appropriate" to raise rates. Investors expect the first in a series of rate hikes to happen in March. The Fed also said it would phase out its monthly bond purchases, which have been intended to lower longer-term rates, in March. The major stock indexes initially rose after the 2pm Eastern release of the Fed statement, but shed most of their gains as Fed Chair Jerome Powell took repeated questions about how and when the central bank will start letting its balance sheet shrink after buying trillions of dollars of bonds through the pandemic. A reduction in the central bank's balance sheet would have a similar effect as additional rate increases. The selling accelerated as Powell acknowledged that the high inflation that has squeezed businesses and consumers isn't getting better, which could force the Fed to get even more aggressive about raising interest rates and removing the support it put in place for markets. "Since the December meeting, I'd say the inflation situation is about the same but probably slightly worse," he said. "It hasn't gotten better. It's probably gotten just a bit worse, and that's been the pattern." Powell also said that there's room to raise interest rates without hurting the labor market, and wouldn't rule out the possibility that the Fed could raise short-term rates at any of its seven remaining meetings this year or opt for a larger-than-usual increase at any one of them. Those comments sent a signal to Wall Street that the Fed may be more hawkish when it comes to tackling inflation, said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at All Star Charts. "In the market's mind, that's more rate hikes, and while he was clear to say that the economy is strong enough to handle those rate hikes, from a strictly (stock) market perspective, higher rates weigh on expensive stocks," Delwiche said. The S&P slipped 6.52 points to 4,349.93. The Dow fell 129.64 points to 34,168.09. The Nasdaq rose 2.82 points to 13,542.12. The indexes are all on pace for weekly losses. The market had been solidly higher prior to the release of the Fed statement following several days of volatile swings. For nearly two years, investors had poured money into stocks, confident that the Federal Reserve would help keep share prices upright. With that support going away, markets have been hit with a bout of volatility. The S&P 500 has fallen 9.3% after closing at an all-time high on Jan 3. Markets have been on edge since early January when minutes released from the Fed's December meeting suggested policymakers may be more zealous about fighting inflation through higher interest rates than many had been expecting. It was at the December meeting that the Fed said it was likely to be quicker than in the past to reduce its huge holdings of bonds it had bought up through the pandemic to keep longer-term interest rates low. A balance sheet reduction would also put upward pressure on interest rates. Powell said Wednesday that policy makers have not set a timetable for when the Fed will start reducing its balance sheet and that the Fed sees short-term rates as the main lever it will use to adjust monetary policy. But he also acknowledged that the balance sheet is "substantially larger" than it needs to be and that the economy no longer needs to have such highly supportive action. That could lead the Fed to move sooner and faster in shrinking its balance sheet. The last time the Fed was raising rates and shrinking its balance sheet at the same time was in late 2018. The S&P 500 lost nearly 20%. "Chair Powell seems more confident than the market that the labor market can tolerate a number of rate hikes this year," said Brian Jacobsen, senior investment strategist at Allspring Global Investments. "The market has voted that he's been tone deaf to some of the lingering economic problems."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-stocks-fall-yields-rise-after-fed-signals-rate-hike-soon/articleshow/89146133.cms||---
---||Business||India seen boosting budget spending on infrastructure||NEW DELHI: India plans to raise spending on infrastructure in its annual budget next week to set the economy on a firmer footing, but fiscal constraints leave little chance of concessions for households hurting from the pandemic, officials said.  Asia's third largest economy is estimated to expand 9.2% in the fiscal year that ends in March, following a contraction of 7.3% in the previous fiscal year.  Yet private consumption, which makes up nearly 55% of GDP, is below pre-pandemic levels amid rising levels of household debt, while retail prices have swelled nearly a tenth since the coronavirus outbreak began in early 2020.  The February 1 budget comes days before the start of elections in five states, including the most populous, Uttar Pradesh, which could spur Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to promise higher rural spending and subsidies on food and fertiliser.  Yet these are likely to be overshadowed by spending to beef up transport and healthcare networks, which analysts estimate could rise between 12% and 25% in the next fiscal year.  "We will focus on reviving the economy through higher investments, while individual and corporate taxes will be kept steady," one official, who sought anonymity, told Reuters, adding that reviving growth would be a priority.  To attract investments that create jobs and spur growth, Sitharaman could also boost incentives tied to production in more industries.  "Continuing on its capex push, we expect another 25% increase in capital expenditure by the central government ... we expect budgetary allocations for roads, highways and railways to rise," Nomura analyst Sonal Varma said in a note.  Food processing and exports are two areas that could see more production-linked incentives, Varma added.  Two senior government officials said no major budget changes were likely on individual and corporate taxes, in view of rising government debt and subdued private investments.  After the government slashed corporate taxes in 2019 to a level among the lowest in Asian nations, further tax breaks for industry are unlikely, the officials said.  "We have one of the lowest taxes for corporates," one added. "More tax cuts are not possible right now."  Businessmen and economists worry about growing risks of inflationary pressure, amid rising global crude prices and the next wave of Covid-19 infections that experts say may threaten over the next eight to 10 weeks.. Rate hike risk  The economy also faces the risk of a rise in interest rates, even before a pick-up in spending by consumers and companies, as the US central bank plans rate hikes.  While the Indian government steps up spending, it will make sure to stick to its longer term goal of fiscal consolidation, the officials said.  The budget is likely to cut the federal fiscal deficit to 6.3% to 6.4% in 2022/23 from 6.8% in 2021/22, government officials and economists said.  That could bring gross market borrowings of about 13 trillion rupees ($174 billion) against an estimated 12.1 trillion this year, analysts estimate.  Past governments have used the budget to announce big-ticket economic reforms, but economists said major steps look unlikely next week, because of political pressures.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi was recently forced to scale back efforts to deregulate agriculture after a year-long protest by farmers.  The government is also unlikely to set ambitious objectives for privatisation after three years of missing its targets, not only because of the pandemic, but also administrative hurdles.  India wants to raise 1.75 trillion rupees ($23 billion) from stake sales in state-run firms, but could not complete the promised sale of refiner Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd, two banks and insurance companies, among others planned last year.  The government has raised less than 100 billion rupees from divestment, but is likely to list insurance behemoth LIC before the end of the fiscal year, which could bring in as much as $12 billion.  "The strategy adopted in the last budget to reduce the ratio of public debt to GDP ... should continue," said economist N.R. Bhanumurthy of the B.R. Ambedkar School of Economics in the southern city of Bengaluru.  This would follow the earlier route of focusing on capital expenditure and privatisation of firms, he added.

The snags in registering their credentials in the portal are making them ineligible to receive the booster dose. For instance, a 28-year-old woman who got vaccinated with the second dose of Covishield in November 2021 did not receive a certificate. The CoWIN portal continues to display that she was skipping the second dose. "I was given the second jab in a mass vaccination camp in Mannarpuram, but the certificate was not generated. After I approached the Trichy Corporation's UPHC, the health workers modified my CoWIN registration details to generate a certificate but the date was January 2022," M Rama, a resident said. Now, for the booster dose, she has to wait for a longer period because of her incomplete registration process. The troubles arose for those had vaccinated in the mass vaccination camps and in MGMGH. Some residents were vaccinated with two doses, but they are yet to get a certificate even for one dose. The residents said that the district administration and corporation can float a helpline to sort out the vaccination certificate grievances. "Complaints are surfacing in the certification lapses, we will consider announcing a platform to clear such grievances. The registration issue on CoWIN is also affecting our vaccination coverage," a corporation official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/trichy/covid-19-trichys-vaccinated-population-in-a-fix-over-incomplete-registration-in-cowin/articleshow/89146285.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Family gets vaccination SMS 8 months after realtor’s death||BENGALURU: Vaccination-related gaffes continue to put Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) in embarrassing situations. The latest one is that of a bereaved family which received phone calls and an SMS saying a family member who died eight months ago had been successfully vaccinated. “It was a double shock for us,” said VS Suresh. His brother Raghavendra Rao, 55, a realtor, had suffered postCovid complications and had died on May 25 last year. “First, they called on my elder brother’s phone and said he was due for vaccination. We told them then that he is no more, but they called again later to say he has been successfully vaccinated. How can they vaccinate someone who is not alive?” On January 23, Suresh was aghast when a data entry operator from BBMP called on Raghavendra’s mobile number to remind him to take the second dose of vaccine. “We attended the call and informed them about his demise, but they failed to pay heed,” Suresh said. The reminders continued to come, upsetting and angering family members who were slowly coming to terms with the death of their dear one. “A few hours later, another BBMP officer called to inform us that he has been successfully vaccinated and we could either collect the certificate online or visit the PHC to collect it in person. We also received an SMS from National Health Protection Scheme (NHPMS) and this disturbed us even more,” Suresh said and added: “Regardless of us telling them numerous times that he is no more, they did not bother to cross-check and update their records. Their attitude was heartless. ” When Suresh checked the online link, he found that his brother was “vaccinated” at Thalaghattapura sub-centre and that the Aadhaar number and name of the vaccinator were also mentioned. “When my brother died, I submitted his Aadhaar number to get a death certificate. Aadhaar is linked to everything. How can they mention the Aadhaar of a dead person? There is no proper communication within BBMP,” he claimed. Suresh said he tried to get in touch with BBMP brass but there was no response. When contacted, a health officer from the Thalaghattapura health centre attributed the incident to a technical error from the data entry operator. “We only update the status; we cannot do anything on the portal. It is controlled by the central government and not BBMP,” he said. Another senior official said the incident would be investigated.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/bengaluru-family-gets-vaccination-sms-8-months-after-realtors-death/articleshow/89146253.cms||Nithya Mandyam
---||Amaravati||Tirupati to become Sri Balaji, Vijayawada gets NTR’s name||AMARAVATI: The temple town of Tirupati is becoming a new district and will be named after the presiding deity Lord Sri Balaji. Devotees of Lord Sri Venkateswara overseas are happy about the proposal and appreciated the state government's decision, on social media. However, devotees in AP, particularly in Tirupati, seemed to have been not convinced with the proposal as the name Sri Balaji is popular only in north India. "It will be better to keep the name simply as Tirupati or name it after Sri Venkateswara or Sri Srinivas instead of Sri Balaji," said Srikanth Reddy, a resident of Tirupati. The release of draft notification proposing names for a few other districts has mostly gone down well with the locals. In a significant political move, the YSRCP government decided to name Vijayawada district after the founding president of Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and former chief minister NT Rama Rao. The TDP, which was in power for almost 14 years after the death of NTR, did not attempt to name a district after the legendary actor and party founder. Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy promised to name a district after NTR during the last election campaign. "This is the difference between Jagan and TDP president N Chandrababu Naidu. While Jagan is a man of deeds, Naidu had always tried to deceive people," civil supplies minister Kodali Sri Venkateswara Rao (Nani) told the media. Demand to name 2 districts after Dalit figuresHowever, the birth place of NTR, Nimmakuru in Krishna district, is now part of Pamarru assembly constituency and went to the newly proposed Krishna district by retaining Machilipatnam as district headquarters. Sources said that the state government has decided to name Vijayawada district after NTR in order to protect the historical significance of Krishna district named after the river Krishna and also port town of Machilipatnam. Saint, legendary musician and poet Annamayya's name has been proposed for Rajampet district. Tallapaka Annamacharya (Annamayya) was born in Kadapa and scripted and composed hundreds of keerthanas praising Lord Sri Venkateswara and Lord Vishnu. Rajampet district lost both the name and the district headquarter status. Rayachoti town is going to be the district headquarters for Annamayya district covering Rajampet Lok Sabha constituency. Araku Lok Sabha constituency will be named after revolutionary freedom fighter Alluri Sitaramaraju. The existing revenue division headquarter Paderu will be district headquarters. Similarly, another district being carved out from Araku Lok Sabha constituency will have Parvathipuram as district headquarters and called Manyam district. Amalapuram district will be named as Konaseema district. This region is known as Konaseema and the district name has gone down well with the locals. Similarly, the government has decided to name Narasaraopet district as Palnadu. A new district to be carved out from Penukonda Lok Sabha constituency will be called Sri Satya Sai district with Puttaparthi as its headquarters. Dalit organisations have, however, demanded to name at least two new districts after renowned dalit personalities.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/amaravati/tirupati-to-become-sri-balaji-vijayawada-gets-ntrs-name/articleshow/89146329.cms||---
---||World||US responds to Russia security demands as Ukraine tensions mount||WASHINGTON: The United States said on Wednesday it had set out a diplomatic path to address sweeping Russian demands in eastern Europe, as Moscow held security talks with Western countries and intensified its military build-up near Ukraine with new drills. In a written response to Russia's demands delivered in person by its ambassador in Moscow, the US repeated its commitment to upholding NATO's "open-door" policy while offering a "principled and pragmatic evaluation" of the Kremlin's concerns, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said. Russia has demanded NATO pull back troops and weapons from eastern Europe and bar its neighbour Ukraine, a former Soviet state, from ever joining. Washington and its NATO allies reject that position but say they are ready to discuss other topics such as arms control and confidence-building measures. "Putting things in writing is ... a good way to make sure we're as precise as possible, and the Russians understand our positions, our ideas, as clearly as possible. Right now, the document is with them and the ball is in their court," Blinken told reporters. Whether President Vladimir Putin is prepared to accept Washington and its allies' agenda will determine the next phase of the crisis, in which Moscow has massed around 100,000 troops near the border with Ukraine while denying it plans to invade. NATO says it is putting forces on standby and reinforcing eastern Europe with more ships and fighter jets, while the US, Britain and others are providing weapons to help Ukraine defend against Russia's much larger army. read more Asked how much time Russia would need to study NATO's response, Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko told Interfax news agency: "We will read it. Study it. The partners studied our project for almost a month and a half." DialogueIn Paris, diplomats from Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany held more than eight hours of talks on ending a separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine, part of the wider crisis between Moscow and Kyiv that risks becoming a full-scale war. The so-called "Normandy" talks were a good signal from Russia and a step toward defusing broader tensions, though major differences remained with further talks planned in Berlin in two weeks, a French official said.

---||World||US responds to Russia security demands as Ukraine tensions mount||WASHINGTON: The United States said on Wednesday it had set out a diplomatic path to address sweeping Russian demands in eastern Europe, as Moscow held security talks with Western countries and intensified its military build-up near Ukraine with new drills. In a written response to Russia's demands delivered in person by its ambassador in Moscow, the US repeated its commitment to upholding NATO's "open-door" policy while offering a "principled and pragmatic evaluation" of the Kremlin's concerns, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said. Russia has demanded NATO pull back troops and weapons from eastern Europe and bar its neighbour Ukraine, a former Soviet state, from ever joining. Washington and its NATO allies reject that position but say they are ready to discuss other topics such as arms control and confidence-building measures. "Putting things in writing is ... a good way to make sure we're as precise as possible, and the Russians understand our positions, our ideas, as clearly as possible. Right now, the document is with them and the ball is in their court," Blinken told reporters. Whether President Vladimir Putin is prepared to accept Washington and its allies' agenda will determine the next phase of the crisis, in which Moscow has massed around 100,000 troops near the border with Ukraine while denying it plans to invade. NATO says it is putting forces on standby and reinforcing eastern Europe with more ships and fighter jets, while the US, Britain and others are providing weapons to help Ukraine defend against Russia's much larger army. read more Asked how much time Russia would need to study NATO's response, Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko told Interfax news agency: "We will read it. Study it. The partners studied our project for almost a month and a half." DialogueIn Paris, diplomats from Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany held more than eight hours of talks on ending a separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine, part of the wider crisis between Moscow and Kyiv that risks becoming a full-scale war. The so-called "Normandy" talks were a good signal from Russia and a step toward defusing broader tensions, though major differences remained with further talks planned in Berlin in two weeks, a French official said.

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Final-year MBBS students want exams postponed||BENGALURU: The clamour to postpone final year MBBS exams for colleges affiliated to Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences (RGUHS) has grown louder, with students claiming that the pandemic has affected their entire academic schedule. They say portions are incomplete and clinical postings are pending. A survey conducted by All India Democratic Students Union (AIDSO) showed that of the 4,500 students — the responders — who they spoke to, 95% of them said they want exams postponed. The exams are scheduled to be held from February 22. “In the background of increasing cases of Covid-19 that affected the entire academic schedule, medical classes were conducted for only seven months instead of 12 months for final year medical students,” said a memorandum from the organisation. “This has led to partial completion of the syllabus and many clinical postings for students are also pending. ” The Union pointed out that the present final-year batch of students had served “at a time of crisis” by treating Covid patients during the second wave last year. However, Dr Jaykara SM, RGUHS, said it would be difficult to change dates now. “All exams including that of nursing and allied sciences are underway,” he said. “Health varsities in other states have also scheduled their exams. Before finalising the dates, the registrar [evaluation] had contacted all principals and taken their consent. Principals had said portions. Exam dates were then finalised. ”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/karnataka-final-year-mbbs-students-want-exams-postponed/articleshow/89146403.cms||---

Ureka Rochelle Black, 33, of Shreveport, was charged with second-degree murder in the death of 10-month-old Joshua Calif Black, the Caddo Parish District Attorney's Office said in a news release Wednesday. Conviction on that charge would bring an automatic sentence of life in prison.  The grand jury that indicted Black on Tuesday also charged her with the attempted second-degree murder of the baby's 5-year-old brother. Conviction on that charge would be punishable by 10 to 50 years without parole, probation, or suspension of sentence.  Police said both boys were thrown into Cross Lake on Sept. 24, 2021.  Black's public defender did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment Wednesday.  Black's sisters, Felicia and Pycolyia Black, told KSLA-TV in September that they had been worried about Black's mental health for some time, but that she refused to get treated.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-woman-accused-of-throwing-kids-in-lake-charged-with-murder/articleshow/89146418.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Reopen childcare centres in Bengaluru, says TAC||BENGALURU: Karnataka’s Covid-19 Technical Advisory Committee has recommended that the state government reopen childcare centres or ‘Shishupalana Kendras’ in Bengaluru. The move was proposed at a meeting on Tuesday, during which committee members discussed daily fresh infections in Bengaluru, hospitalisation numbers and fatality rates. “There was a proposal from the government to discuss settin g u p of ‘Shishupalana Kendras’ run by the government,” TAC sources said. “Given the current scenario of the third wave, though cases are surging, the hospitalisation rate is less than 6%. Reopening of such childcare centres will help working women which is why we have made the recommendation. ” Sources added that the positivity rate among children in Bengaluru is 10% and paediatric admissions is only 2%. “To send children to childcare centres, the child has to be as y m p tomatic and p arents must have taken both doses of the vaccines,” said sources. Members also discussed the challenges of reopening schools for classes 1-9 in Bengaluru, and it was decided to review the matter again after a week. Schools in the capital were closed after the surge in cases. However, educationists and school mana g ements have slammed the government, pointing out that education does not appear to be a priority for the state since virtually every other sector has been allowed to function. “We need to watch the trend for another week at least and conduct further analysis before deciding about allowin g schools to reopen,” said TAC members. The committee has also recommended — again — that the government allow home isolation for international travellers who test positive for Covid on arrival, if they are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. While a similar recommendation was made on January 22, as reported by TOI earlier, the government ignored it as the Centre’s guidelines on the issue had not explicitly mentioned home isolation for international travellers who test p ositive on arrival.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/reopen-childcare-centres-in-bengaluru-says-tac/articleshow/89146524.cms||---
---||World||UN chief urges major Afghan aid increase, unfreezing assets||UNITED NATIONS : The UN chief urged nations Wednesday to greatly boost humanitarian aid for millions of Afghans living in “a frozen hell” and release nearly $9 billion in frozen assets to pull Afghanistan’s economy back from the brink of a collapse that could set off a mass exodus of people fleeing the country. “Time is of the essence,” Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the Security Council. “Without action, lives will be lost, and despair and extremism will grow.” Guterres said liquidity must be urgently restored to the Afghan economy. He said that means freeing up the country’s frozen currency reserves, re-engaging with its Central Bank and finding other ways to inject money, including allowing international funds to pay the salaries of doctors, teachers, sanitation workers, electricians and other civil servants. China and Russia reiterated their calls for unfreezing Afghan assets, while US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said the Biden administration is examining “various options to ease the liquidity crunch.” She said the United States, which announced an initial contribution of $308 million in humanitarian aid for Afghanistan on Jan. 11, remains the largest provider of assistance to the country. But she said that “much more support from the international community will be required to meet the extraordinary level of need the Afghan people are experiencing.” Afghanistan’s aid-dependent economy was already stumbling when the Taliban seized power last August amid the chaotic departure of U.S. and NATO troops after 20 years. The international community froze Afghanistan’s assets abroad and halted economic support, unwilling to work with the Taliban, given the brutality during their 1996-2001 rule and refusal to educate girls and allow women to work. Guterres said the World Bank’s reconstruction trust fund for Afghanistan transferred $280 million last month to the U.N. children’s agency UNICEF and the World Food Program. He said the remaining $1.2 million should be released urgently to help Afghans survive the winter. Deborah Lyons, the U.N. special representative for Afghanistan, told the council that the more than $4.4 billion humanitarian appeal the U.N. launched two weeks ago for Afghanistan -- the largest in the U.N.’s history for a single country -- “is roughly the same amount that donors spent on the entire operating budget of the government.” Most of that budget support came from the United States. The U.N. says 8.7 million Afghans are on the brink of starvation, and Guterres said over half the population faces “extreme levels of hunger.” “More than 80% of the population relies on contaminated drinking water, and some families are selling their babies to purchase food,” he said. The council adopted a resolution last month affirming that humanitarian aid to Afghans doesn’t violate sanctions against the Taliban, but China’s U.N. ambassador, Zhang Jun, claimed aid “is being used as a bargaining chip, a political tool.” That is “playing games with the lives and well-being of 38 million Afghans who are in dire need of relief,” Zhang said, saying that freezing Afghan assets and unilateral sanctions “are no less lethal than military intervention.” If Afghan women “can’t even have food or survive, then the talk of education, employment and political participation will become empty words,” he added. Deputy Russian Ambassador Dmitry Polyansky warned that unless the issue of unfreezing Afghanistan’s assets is quickly solved “Afghanistan has no long-term prospects to make it out of this crisis.” “We call on the United States and other Western donors to get the money back to the country,” he said. “The money belongs to the Afghan people and cannot be used for bargaining or as a tool to punish the Afghans for the new reality that has evolved in their country.” Polyansky warned that the consequences of Afghanistan’s economic collapse will not only increase the number of refugees but will “spread terrorist activity, boost drug production and, as a result, lead to even greater instability both in the region and beyond.” Lyons, the UN envoy, said in a video briefing from Kabul that it is clear donors are still not satisfied with political progress by the Taliban, either in including greater ethnic diversity in its government or in ensuring girls’ higher education and women’s opportunities to work. This week, a high-level Taliban delegation met with Afghan civil society representatives in the Norwegian capital, Oslo. Lyons noted that a joint communique from the talks highlighted that “understanding and joint cooperation are the only solutions to all the problems of Afghanistan.” She said now the Taliban “must act on it.” Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre, whose country holds the Security Council presidency this month and chaired the meeting, said the Taliban delegation also held direct talks with representatives from Norway, the U.S., France and Britain, but he stressed that did not signify recognition of the Taliban government. “We have to talk to them, engage them and present very clear expectations, because Afghanistan is today facing a dire humanitarian crisis and a million children may starve,” Støre said in an interview with The Associated Press. He said there were no negotiations, no agreement signed, but the talks as far as he could see were “the beginning of something that can lead to something.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/un-chief-urges-major-afghan-aid-increase-unfreezing-assets/articleshow/89146421.cms||---
---||World||Moderna begins trial of Omicron-specific vaccine booster||WASHINGTON: US biotech company Moderna announced on Wednesday that it has begun clinical trials of a booster dose of vaccine designed specifically to combat the Omicron variant of the coronavirus.  The trials will involve a total of 600 adults half of whom have already received two doses of Moderna's Covid-19 vaccine at least six months ago, and half of whom have received two doses plus the previously authorized booster dose.  The booster specifically targeting Omicron will therefore be evaluated as both a third and a fourth dose.  The company also reported results on the efficacy against Omicron of the booster that has already been authorized.  It said that six months after the booster injection, the levels of neutralizing antibodies against Omicron were reduced by six times from the peak observed 29 days after the injection but remained detectable in all participants.  These data were obtained by studying the blood of 20 people who received the 50 microgram booster, half the amount of the first two injections.  "We are reassured by the antibody persistence against Omicron at six months after the currently authorized" booster, Moderna chief executive Stephane Bancel said in the statement.  "Nonetheless, given the long-term threat demonstrated by Omicron's immune escape, we are advancing our Omicron-specific variant vaccine booster candidate and we are pleased to begin this part of our Phase 2 study," Bancel continued.  Moderna's statement came the day after rivals Pfizer and BioNTech said they had begun enrollment for a clinical trial for an Omicron-specific vaccine.  Both vaccines are based on messenger RNA technology, which makes it relatively easy to update them to keep up with mutations specific to new variants.  Several countries, including the United States, have begun to see a decline in cases associated with the infection wave caused by Omicron, the most transmissible variant detected so far, but the number of infections worldwide continues to rise.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/moderna-begins-trial-of-omicron-specific-vaccine-booster/articleshow/89146706.cms||---

The identities of the victims were not released but they were believed to have known each other, local police said.  Investigators said initial evidence showed it was "a targeted shooting" in a normally quiet neighborhood, but police do not believe the homicides were connected to gang violence in the region.  Police said its officers were called to the location late on Tuesday and that the victims were likely killed on Monday night.  The investigation was in its early stages, police added. "It is a traumatic incident the community is waking up to," David Lee from the homicide investigation team said in a statement. Firearm-related homicides in Canada have steadily increased, reaching 277 in 2020, according to government statistics.

---||World||Minds behind the missiles: North Korea's secretive weapons developers||SEOUL: North Korea’s flurry of new missile tests, including what it calls “hypersonic” weapons, has underscored the importance of the country’s missile engineers and scientists, a group that is high profile within his government but opaque to outsiders. Analysts say Kim Jong Un appears to be taking steps to institutionalize the missile forces, signalling his likely intent to make them a long-term, operational part of his military plans. Here's what we know – and what we don’t – about these key personnel. THE SCIENTISTSVery little is known about the names and positions of the mid-level and working-level scientists and technicians involved in missile research and development. Analysts say these individuals appear to have guaranteed job security because of the resources and effort expended to educate and train them, and they are sequestered to special districts so they are neither a defection risk nor a political or social nuisance to the regime. “Unlike economic cadres or even military commanders, this is a population that is not easily replaced,” said Michael Madden, a North Korea leadership expert at the Washington-based Stimson Center. Many of them attend Kim Jong Un National Defense University, a training ground for North Korean defense-related science and technology specialists that has reportedly added a college focused on “hypersonic missile technology.” The scientists and engineers often appear split into competing teams designing similar types of weapons, allowing them to go down multiple routes to see which technology is the most promising, said Ken Gause, director of the International Affairs Group at CNA, a non-profit research and analysis organisation based in Arlington, Virginia. A 2018 study by the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies (CNS) found North Korean scientists had worked with researchers in other countries to co-write at least 100 published articles that had identifiable significance for dual-use technology, weapons of mass destruction, or other military purposes. THE OFFICIALSKim Jong Un relies on three top people to lead the secretive country’s rapidly accelerating missile programme. They include Ri Pyong Chol, a former top air force general; Kim Jong Sik, a veteran rocket scientist; and Jang Chang Ha, the head of a weapons development and procurement centre. A fourth official - Pak Jong Chon, the chief of the General Staff - has also assumed a higher-profile role in the Military Industry Department (MID), which is responsible for production of strategic weapons, Gause said. "We have seen a lot of changes in the military industry arena in the last few years," Gause said. Pak oversaw many recent tests in the absence of Kim Jong Un, who did not attend any missile launches in 2021, before observing one of the hypersonic missile launches in January. Last year also saw the appointment of Yu Jim to lead the MID. Yu was previously a representative of North Korea’s primary state arms dealer in Iran, Madden said. THE ORGANISATIONSThe Academy of National Defense Science (NADS), also known as the Second Academy of Natural Sciences (SANS), oversees North Korea's missile development. Madden said the state of a weapon's development can often be divined from who is reported to have attended a test. An event where the only personnel are from NADS/SANS means the system is still in the research and development phase, for example. If an event combines NADS and the 2nd Economic Committee, that often means that the system is moving from development to production and manufacturing. Finally, if the military’s General Staff Department (GSD) personnel attend a test, such as the recent train mobile missile, this usually indicates that the system is finished and will be deployed. There are initial signals that as North Korea completes its missile and nuclear arsenal, it may fold more elements of its Strategic Forces back under GSD, signalling it has moved to an operational role, Madden added. FOREIGN ASSISTANCENorth Korea’s missile programme has roots in assistance it received from the Soviet Union, and later Russia, analysts say, and the boosters involved in propelling the latest hypersonic warheads are similar to Soviet designs. There is debate over how much that assistance has continued since the 1990s. According to the latest sanctions designations by the United States, North Koreans linked to the NADS in China and Russia continue to procure materials and technical information for North Korea’s WMD and missile programmes, aided by at least one Russian telecommunications company and a Russian national. Markus Schiller, a Europe-based missile expert, has argued that North Korea’s success in testing suggests it has had external support. Schiller notes, however, that under Kim Jong Un, North Korean missiles failed more often than in the past, suggesting that the younger Kim was testing more homegrown designs than his predecessors.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/minds-behind-the-missiles-north-koreas-secretive-weapons-developers/articleshow/89146598.cms||---
---||Business||Budget 2022: Five things FM Sitharaman can do to make life easier for income tax payers in India||Ease in filing of income tax returns as well as strengthening the online grievance redressal mechanism for taxpayers are two key demands made by the common man with regard to tax administrative changes. India's tax laws are rather complex and for simple tax calculations too one has to do two computations to figure out which method of taxation works better. Tax return forms require various details for all kinds of investments, capital gains, bank interest calculations, dividend earned etc. For example, for capital gains and dividends, you have to give quarter-wise details to compute interest liability as well as transaction wise details of shares sold on stock markets for computation of capital gains. For bank interest, you have to calculate your yearly interest based on the quarterly interest received from the bank. Moreover, the returns forms change each year, making the task of filing returns rather tedious and confusing. While various taxpayer friendly initiatives have been launched by the government to bolster the transparency of financial transactions in the country such as E-Sahyog ( a paperless mechanism whereby the income tax (IT) department notifies assesses electronically), e-verification of ITR to shorten the processing time and issuance of refunds, Income Disclosure Scheme (IDS), increase in PAN cards issued, and TDS SMS alerts, , a lot needs to be done to ensure the entire system remains seamless in administration, information is readily available, and facilities are accessible to all, according to Dezan Shira & Associates. Here are a few ways Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman can make life easier for income tax payers in India:1. Keep just one tax regime as opposed to an old and new one: A new tax regime was introduced in the 2020-2021 budget to offer taxpayers a simplified tax regime with more graded slabs that offered benefits to those not opting for exemptions and deductions but data from tax service provider Clear shows only 10% of taxpayers who utilized its portal for tax filing opted for the new regime. Unlike the new system, the old tax regime offers various exemptions and benefits, and it appears that a considerable percentage of individual taxpayers continue to prefer that. "Individuals find the old regime is better because the various tax deductions and exemptions can effectively reduce the tax on a CTC of Rs 10 lakh, which is unlikely in case under the new regime. Individuals with an income bracket of up to 5 lacs and between Rs 5-10 lakh with lower deductions claims will benefit from the new regime. But on the other hand, individuals under a higher income tax bracket above Rs 10 lakh of income per annum will end up paying more tax under the new tax regime, else could have been benefitted more from the existing regime by making tax-saving investments," says CA Ruchika Bhagat, MD, Neeraj Bhagat & Co. "From a tax payer’s perspective, two income tax regimes are confusing and the existing income tax slabs must be revised. In taxation, there should be no confusion or uncertainty. There is a compelling justification for further individual income tax rate rationalisation," said Bhagat. Hence, the government should consider unifying and retaining only one simplified regime going forward. For individual taxpayers it is becoming tough to understand the pros and cons of each regime. In fact most of the individuals are struggling to find out which one would be more beneficial in one’s specific case. "Various exemptions and deductions are available under the provisions and the composition of these tax benefits widely differ from person to person. Hence, a comparative statement cannot be standardised as to depict which regime is more beneficial and this is demotivating the individuals regarding compliance of filing ITR. The government should standardise the rates and simplify the law and process to encourage more and more individuals for the compliance. In case the government wants to keep motivating individuals for savings and investments, instead of allowing as deduction from total income, the earnings from such investments can be made exempted and a simplified one single regime can be implemented so that lower current tax rate and reduced burden of tax in future on invested money shall motivate the individuals for compliance," recommends Paras Nath, Partner, Tax and Regulatory Services, TR Chadha & Co. Also, since individual taxpayers have an option to opt in and out of the new scheme, it unnecessarily results in a compliance burden for companies, for they will have to maintain requisite data sets of employees choosing the new regime, those sticking with the old regime, and those switching between the two. Clear's Archit Gupta recommends only one tax regime with a lower tax burden and one way to achieve this is to increment standard deduction annually based on inflation. He also recommends removing redundant exemptions such as children’s education allowance or hostel expenditure allowance and instead allow deductions for those who work from home. 2. Make the first appellate / dispute resolution mechanism provided under the Act more effective: Assessment and appeal processes have seen major transformation in the recent years. While these initiatives have eliminated the need for personal interface between tax officers and assessees, there have been teething problems in implementation. Further finetuning of these processes by introduction of necessary legislative changes and clarification will help the taxpayers reap the benefit of these reforms fully, said S.Vasudevan, Executive Partner, Lakshmikumaran & Sridharan Attorneys. "The dispute resolution appellate is not in reality independent, in the sense that they report to CBDT (under the Ministry of Finance), the same administrative body which appraises them for tax collection. If the officers posted under first appellate / dispute resolution mechanism are shifted under the Ministry of Law and Justice while being posted as appellate / dispute resolution officers, the result will be far more effective. We have proof of that in the functioning of the highly respected Income-tax Appellate Tribunal," said Nishant Thakkar, Partner, Lumiere Law Partners. Secondly, the current first appellate mechanism does not give any priority to individuals and in particular senior citizens and hence their appeals take very long to be heard and disposed of. "The priority being suggested is a well-recognised classification for e.g. the High Courts have a separate list for all senior citizen litigation, the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal has a separate Bench for small matters (Single Member Matters) etc. If such a priority is made available at the first appellate stage, it would be of great help to individuals and in particular senior citizens," added Thakkar. 3 Simply the online tax return forms: The FM should make a genuine effort to simplify online tax return forms and make confirmations and disclosures optional for individual taxpayers. "Ease of Tax Filing is getting worse and rates of people not filing returns is going higher. "Currently apart from filling income tax return (‘ITR’), taxpayer is also required to make various other compliances (e.g. to file form 10IE for opting new tax regime, form 67 for claiming a foreign tax credit, Form 10BA for claiming deduction u/s 80GG, etc.). The information which is to be furnished in these forms are otherwise required to be furnished in the ITR and creates multiple compliance requirements. Government should eliminate such multiple compliances and make the ITR form as a single document for all such compliances," said Ashok Shah-Partner, NA Shah Associates. 4. Integration: Interest that gets accumulated in your savings bank account must be declared in your tax return under income from other sources. Interest from both fixed deposit and recurring deposits is taxable while interest from savings bank account and post office deposits are tax-deductible to a certain extent. But they are shown under income from other sources, explains Clear. But more often than not, taxpayers, because of lack of awareness, forget to put the fixed deposit interest/ Saving account interest in the ITR. "If, this can be integrated with the Annual Information System and if the data can be pulled automatically, it will reduce the compliance burden and will also make sure that there is a high degree of tax compliance," said Gaurav Garg, Head of Research at CapitalVia Global Research. Many taxpayers lament that the compliance burden has increased with two forms to be reviewed, Form 26AS and AIS. " The finance minister can consider incorporating the details of LIC premium paid, Public Provident Fund, home loan interest and principal payment etc in Form no 26AS/AIS. With this, the small individuals and businessmen will have easy access to all the deductions/ exemptions in Form no 26AS/AIS," said Shah. Form 26AS and AIS should be merged and consolidated into one, recommends Clear's Gupta. Moreover, by introducing the new TDS and TCS provisions in relation to sale and purchase of goods, the government has unnecessarily created new compliance burdens for transactions which were already covered under other reporting mechanism such as in GST billing. Thus, the government should consider withdrawing these provisions, said Vinita Krishnan, Partner, Khaitan & Co. 5 Introduction of Inflation-indexed Basic Exemption Limit: Currently, we have a system where exemption limits are set every year — or not changed at all. Whether it is the basic tax-free income limit or the limits for Section 80 C deductions, inflation erodes it each year. "An index-linked system of tax exemptions and deductions will allow citizens to be spared higher taxes resulting only from inflation," said Anand Chatrath, Managing Partner, B M Chatrath& Co LLP. He also recommends that the divergence between corporate and personal income tax rates be brought down through rationalisation of surcharge and reduction of taxes at the top end of the bracket. "Or else, individuals with high tax rates over 30 percent will shift incomes to corporates owned by them. A five-year plan to converge personal tax rates towards corporate ones (now in the 15-25 percent range) should be announced in the budget," said Chatrath.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2022-five-things-fm-sitharaman-can-do-to-make-life-easier-for-income-tax-payers-in-india/articleshow/89146752.cms||Sunainaa Chadha

Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he would speak again in the coming days to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, as a separate initiative by France brought a promise by Moscow at least to keep talking to Ukraine's government. One month after Russia put forward sweeping security proposals, having sent tens of thousands of troops to Ukraine's border, the United States delivered a reply in co-ordination with NATO allies and said it was ready for any eventuality. "It sets out a serious diplomatic path forward should Russia choose it," Blinken told reporters of the US response, which he said would remain confidential. He renewed an offer on "reciprocal" measures to address mutual security concerns, including reductions of missiles in Europe and transparency on military drills and Western aid to Ukraine. But he made clear that the United States would not budge on Russia's core demand that Ukraine never be allowed to join NATO, the US-backed military alliance. "From our perspective, I can't be more clear -- NATO's door is open, remains open, and that is our commitment," Blinken said. Russia, which has a complicated historical relationship with Ukraine, has fueled an insurgency in the former Soviet republic's east that has killed more than 13,000 people since 2014. Russia that year also seized Crimea after the overthrow of a government in Kyiv that had resisted efforts to move closer to Europe. The United States has warned of severe and swift consequences if Russia invades, including possible personal sanctions on President Vladimir Putin, and NATO has put 8,500 troops on standby. "While we are hoping for and working for a good solution -- de-escalation -- we are also prepared for the worst," NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said. Blinken's deputy Wendy Sherman, who led a previous round of talks with Russia, said Putin seemed ready to invade despite the US warnings. "I have no idea whether he's made the ultimate decision, but we certainly see every indication that he is going to use military force sometime perhaps (between) now and the middle of February," Sherman told a forum. In another bid to defuse tensions, senior Russian and Ukrainian officials met for eight hours in Paris with representatives of France and Germany. Dmitry Kozak, the Kremlin deputy chief of staff, said the talks were "not simple" but that another round would take place in two weeks in Berlin. France said after the so-called Normandy Format talks that the envoys committed to a fragile July 2020 ceasefire in eastern Ukraine between government forces and pro-Moscow separatists. "We need a supplementary pause. We hope that this process will have results in two weeks," Kozak said. An aide to French President Emmanuel Macron stressed that the talks had been about resolving the separatist fighting in eastern Ukraine, not the threat of a Russian invasion. But "the question was whether the Russians wanted to signal a thaw," he said, adding that the "difficult" discussions had ultimately resulted in something positive. "In the current circumstances, we received a good signal," he said. France and Germany have joined the United States in warning Russia against an invasion but have been less direct about sanctions. Germany's new coalition government has sent mixed signals on whether it would sever the soon-to-open Nord Stream 2 pipeline from Russia, which will circumvent Ukraine to provide gas to Europe's largest economy. US President Joe Biden, who spoke with European leaders by video-conference on Tuesday, said that any Russian military attack on Ukraine would trigger "enormous consequences" and could even "change the world." Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, while brushing off the impact, warned that attempts to punish Putin personally would be "destructive." The United States again encouraged its citizens to leave Ukraine, warning an invasion could be imminent. But Ukraine's government, hoping to prevent panic, has played down the dangers and sought to offer ways out. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told reporters the Russian troops posed "a threat to Ukraine" but that the numbers deployed were "insufficient for a full-scale offensive." Andriy Yermak, an advisor to President Volodymyr Zelensky who took part in the Paris talks, wrote on Twitter that the meeting was "a strong signal of readiness for a peaceful settlement." In an early move to de-escalate that was envisaged by France, Ukraine's government this week withdrew a bill in parliament governing the status of Russian-backed separatist provinces in the east of the country, which Moscow saw as violating previous commitments. France is hoping that Russia will agree in turn to humanitarian measures such as prisoner exchanges in eastern Ukraine and the opening of checkpoints manned by the separatists. But Zelensky has stood firm against another French suggestion of direct talks between Ukraine's government and the Russian-backed separatists.

The maximum temperature stood at 16.2 degree Celsius, 5.5 degrees below normal. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), cold winds from the northwest will blow over Gurugram and Delhi-NCR. Night temperature will drop further by two-three degrees over the next few days and there is a possibility of cold wave conditions on January 28 and 29, IMD officials said. Though the minimum temperature dipped on Wednesday, the city witnessed a daytime respite after two consecutive 'severe cold days', as the day was sunny for some time. According to IMD, a 'severe cold day' is when the minimum temperature is less than 10 degrees Celsius, and the maximum temperature is at least 6.5 degree Celsius below the season's normal. The department's forecast for Thursday states that there will be mist in the morning and the sky will remain clear throughout the day. "There will be only shallow fog in the morning hours, followed by a sunny afternoon. Chilly winds will keep daytime temperatures low. The maximum temperature is expected to hover between 13 and 16 degrees Celsius in the coming days," meteorologist Navdeep Dahiya said. This month, Gurugram has seen four 'cold days' on January 10, 14, 16 and 17, and three 'severe cold days' on January 15, 24 and 25. Meanwhile, the health department has advised people to stay away from crowded places. "All hospitals are on alert and have created flu corners. There is a rise in cases of viral fever as well as allergies. We appeal to people to wear masks whenever they step out of their homes," Gurugram chief medical officer Virender Yadav said. The city on Tuesday recorded the coldest day of the season so far, with the maximum temperature at 11.7 degrees Celsius, which was nine degrees below the normal mark. The minimum temperature was recorded at 7.3 degrees Celsius, a degree above normal. This season's lowest minimum temperature was recorded at 4.5 degrees on January 1. The ciy's air quality remained in the 'poor' category on Wednesday. The air quality index (AQI) in the city stood at 236 on Wednesday, a marginal improvement from 238 the day before. According to the weather bulletin issued by the Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi-NCR, moderate winds and better ventilation conditions are likely to prevail for the next seven days, due to which the air quality is likely to remain largely in the "poor" to "moderate" category. Meanwhile in Delhi, the spell of 'cold day' continued for the third consecutive day on Wednesday. Parts of the national capital even witnessed 'severe cold day' conditions. Despite an improvement from Tuesday, the maximum temperature was at 16.4 degrees Celsius, six degrees below normal, at Safdarjung, Delhi's base station.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/no-respite-likely-soon-brace-for-more-chill-as-mercury-to-dip-by-2-3c-in-gurugram/articleshow/89146902.cms||---
---||World||EU urges Mali to reconsider troop withdrawal demand||PARIS: European nations pushed back Wednesday against the Malian military government's demands that newly arrived Danish special forces fighting jihadists immediately withdraw from the Sahel state. Task Force Takuba brings together special forces from European countries to advise Malian troops and assist them in combat, with roughly 90 Danes joining earlier this month.  The junta on Monday asked Denmark to "immediately" withdraw its contingent, alleging the troops had been deployed without their consent, a position rejected by the Danish government a day later.  A statement from nations involved in the French-led Task Force Takuba on Wednesday defended the deployment, saying the partners were acting "within a robust legal framework agreed upon by Mali's sovereign government, including a formal invitation from the Malian authorities to international partners."  The European countries called on Mali to "quickly remedy this situation at a critical time for Mali, when solidarity is required more than ever."  Danish Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod on Tuesday had said his nation's forces were in Mali "on a clear basis" and his government was seeking to clarify the issue.  "There is currently a difficult diplomatic discussion with the transitional government," he added.  Mali's junta, which came to power in a 2020 coup, responded late Wednesday it had read Kofod's "inappropriate" comments with "surprise and consternation".  Task Force Takuba is the fruit of lengthy French efforts to coax European allies into shouldering some of the burden of fighting jihadists in Mali, the nexus of a nearly decade-old insurgency in the Sahel.  Paris has engaged in "in-depth consultations" with its European partners participating in the special forces group, French Defence Minister Florence Parly said Tuesday, stressing that "the junta is multiplying its provocations".  This diplomatic spat is the latest obstacle to French and European military action in Mali.  Monday's coup in Burkina Faso also complicates the equation for Paris.  Of the four Sahel countries where the anti-jihadist Barkhane force is deployed, three Chad, Mali, Burkina are now ruled by military juntas.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/eu-urges-mali-to-reconsider-troop-withdrawal-demand/articleshow/89146951.cms||---

While the TDP has welcomed the move, they also demanded that Machilipatnam district be named NTR Krishna district. Former chief minister and founder of TDP NTR was born in Nimmakuru village which is located under Machilipatnam parliamentary constituency. NTR’s association with the district was a close one. He completed his degree at SRR & CVR college in the city. The demand to name Krishna district as NTR district has been in circulation for almost one decade. Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy during his ‘padayatra’ in the district promised to rename Krishna district as NTR district. Now, the state government has named the newly formed Vijayawada district as NTR Vijayawada district. “Our government is committed to our election promises. Y S Jagan is known for his nature of fulfilling promises. Keeping politics aside YS Jagan named Vijayawada district after NTR who is a legendary actor and people’s CM of the state.  We never bother about politics when it comes to welfare of the public,” endowments minister Vellampalli Srinivas said. Meanwhile, TDP leaders are demanding the government rename the existing Krishna district. “NTR spent his childhood at Nimmakuru which is located in Pamarru assembly constituency. People from Gudivada, Machilipatnam and Pamarru raised demands to name a new district after NTR. But the government has ignored their demand and named Vijayawada district as NTR district. We demand the government revise its decision,” said Ganduri Venkata Mahesh, a TDP leader||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/mixed-reactions-greet-new-ntr-vijayawada-district/articleshow/89146987.cms||Venu Lanka

---||World||At least 3 judges eyed as Joe Biden mulls Supreme Court pick||WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden is eyeing at least three judges for an expected vacancy on the Supreme Court as he prepares to quickly deliver on his campaign pledge to nominate the first Black woman to the nation's highest court, according to aides and allies. Biden and Justice Stephen Breyer are expected to hold an event at the White House Thursday to formally announce Breyer's plans to retire, according to a person briefed on the planning who was not authorized to publicly discuss it in advance. Early discussions about a successor are focusing on U.S. Circuit Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, U.S. District Judge J. Michelle Childs and California Supreme Court Justice Leondra Kruger, according to four people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss White House deliberations. Jackson and Kruger have long been seen as possible nominees. Since Biden took office in January 2021, he has focused on nominating a diverse group of judges to the federal bench, installing five Black women on federal appeals courts, with three more nominations pending before the Senate. Other possible candidates for the high court could come from among that group, Biden aides and allies said, especially since almost all of the recent Supreme Court nominees have been federal appeals judges. ``He has a strong pool to select a candidate from, in addition to other sources. This is an historic opportunity to appoint someone with a strong record on civil and human rights,'' said Derrick Johnson, the NAACP's president. By the end of his first year, Biden had won confirmation of 40 judges, the most since President Ronald Reagan. Of those, 80% are women and 53% are people of color, according to the White House. Jackson, 51, was nominated by President Barack Obama to be a district court judge. Biden elevated her to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Early in her career, she was also a law clerk for Breyer. Childs, a federal judge in South Carolina, has been nominated but not yet confirmed to serve on the same circuit court. Her name has surfaced partly because she is a favorite among some high-profile lawmakers, including Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C. Kruger, a graduate of Harvard and Yale's law school, was previously a Supreme Court clerk and has argued a dozen cases before the justices as a lawyer for the federal government. Breyer, 83, will retire at the end of the summer, according to two sources who confirmed the news to The Associated Press on Wednesday. They spoke on condition of anonymity so as not to preempt Breyer's formal announcement. But the Senate can confirm a successor before there is a formal vacancy, so the White House was getting to work and it was expected to take at least a few weeks before a nomination was formalized. Biden said Wednesday he wasn't going to get ahead of Breyer's announcement. ``Every justice should have an opportunity to decide what he or she is going to do and announce it on their own,`` Biden said. ``Let him make whatever statement he's going to make and I'll be happy to talk about it later.'' When Biden was running for the White House, he said that if he had the chance to nominate someone to the court, he would make history by choosing a Black woman. And he's reiterated that pledge since. ``As president, I'd be honored, honored to appoint the first African American woman. Because it should look like the country. It's long past time,'' Biden said in February 2020 shortly before South Carolina's presidential primary. Adding a Black woman to the court would mean a series of firsts - four female justices and two Black justices serving at the same time on the nine-member court. Justice Clarence Thomas is the court's only Black justice and just the second ever, after Thurgood Marshall. And Biden would have the chance to show Black voters increasingly frustrated with a president they helped to elect that he is serious about their concerns, particularly after he has been unable to push through voting rights legislation. At the same time, Breyer's replacement by another liberal justice would not change the ideological makeup of the court. Conservatives outnumber liberals by 6-3, and Donald Trump's three nominees made an already conservative court even more conservative. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Biden's nominee ``will receive a prompt hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee and will be considered and confirmed by the full United States Senate with all deliberate speed.'' But Republicans in particular remain upset about Justice Brett Kavanaugh's contentious 2018 hearing. Still, Democrats have the 50 votes plus a tiebreaker in Vice President Kamala Harris that they need to confirm a nominee. Republicans who changed the Senate rules during the Trump-era to allow simple majority confirmation of Supreme Court nominees appeared resigned to the outcome. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, an influential Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in a statement, ``If all Democrats hang together _ which I expect they will _ they have the power to replace Justice Breyer in 2022 without one Republican vote in support.`` Nonetheless, Democrats have also been unable to get all their members on board for Biden's social and environmental spending agenda or to move forward with a voting rights bill. As a senator, Biden served as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, overseeing six Supreme Court confirmation hearings from 1987 to 1995, including Breyer's. And one person who will be central to Biden's process is chief of staff Ron Klain, a former Supreme Court law clerk and chief counsel to that committee. Two other Black women whom Biden appointed to federal appeals courts are also seen as contenders: Holly Thomas, a longtime civil rights lawyer he named to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, and Candace Jackson-Akiwumi, a former public defender he named to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit. Biden could also choose someone from outside the judiciary, though that seems less likely. One contender would be the head of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Sherrilyn Ifill, 59. She has headed the fund since 2013 and has announced she is stepping down in the spring. The Supreme Court has had three women on it for more than a decade, since 2010, when Obama named Justice Elena Kagan to the court to replace the retiring John Paul Stevens. Kagan joined Obama's other nominee, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the court's first Latina justice, and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. When Ginsburg died in September 2020, Trump announced his choice of Amy Coney Barrett eight days later.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/at-least-3-judges-eyed-as-joe-biden-mulls-supreme-court-pick/articleshow/89147119.cms||---

The conference was supposed to be held on Wednesday in Kabul, reported TOLO News. The Afghanistan Journalist Center in a statement said the conference was to be attended by 11 representatives from different media organisations. "All national and international media outlets were covering it, however, unfortunately, due to the verbal order of the officials of the Islamic Emirate, the conference was cancelled," said Ali Asghar Akbarzada, head of the Afghanistan National Journalists' Union. Members of the Afghanistan National Journalists Union said that the Islamic Emirate instructed them to not hold the conference until they receive permission. "We call on the Islamic Emirate to finalise their decision in the future. They should make the decision as soon as possible and give us a permit so we can hold our conference based on it," Akbarzada said. The Taliban government did not comment over whether it prohibited the conference of the media outlets or not but said that it remains supportive of the media, based on Islamic regulations. Over 43 per cent of media activities have been halted and over 60 per cent of media employees have become jobless since the Taliban swept into power in Afghanistan, say media reports.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/taliban-govt-stops-media-outlets-from-holding-conference/articleshow/89147256.cms||---

On Wednesday, Upadhyay was expelled for six years from the primary membership of the party. A letter to this effect, signed by the party’s state in-charge Devender Yadav, read, "Since you have been continuously indulging yourself in anti-party activities despite several warnings, you are hereby expelled from the primary membership of Congress party with immediate effect." On Thursday, Kishore Upadhyay joined BJP in Dehradun. The saffron party is likely to field him from the Tehri constituency, which he has won twice in the 2002 and 2007 assembly elections. Earlier, on January 12, the party had removed Upadhyay from all posts for "hobnobbing with BJP and other political parties to undermine the fight against the ruling party." When asked about Upadhyay's expulsion, Uttarakhand Congress general secretary (organisation) Mathura Dutt Joshi told TOI, “Upadhyay was a senior member and the party had given him several key posts. However, despite several warnings, Upadhyay continued hobnobbing with other political outfits. Therefore, action has been taken against him." A minister in the first elected government of Uttarakhand, Upadhyay was earlier seen as a close associate of Harish Rawat. Political observers say Rawat played a pivotal role in Upadhyay's elevation as the state Congress chief in 2014. However, soon after, bickering between the two leaders came to the fore. In 2017, Upadhyay was denied a ticket from his traditional Tehri seat after he raised the issue of “one family, one ticket formula”. He was made Congress nominee from the Sahaspur constituency in Dehradun instead. Upadhyay lost from the Sahaspur constituency and the Congress was reduced to just 11 seats in the 70-member state assembly. After the 2017 assembly poll debacle, Upadhyay was replaced by Pritam Singh as the new state Congress chief. Prior to this, Upadhyay had lost from the Tehri constituency by a close margin in 2012. However, he still has a strong vote base in the constituency and Tehri district.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/kishore-upadhyay-former-uttarakhand-congress-chief-expelled-for-6-years-likely-to-join-the-bjp/articleshow/89147468.cms||Kautilya Singh

They also urged the government to provide journalists with security, The News International reported. Hasnain Shah, a crime reporter on a private TV channel, was shot dead outside Lahore Press Club. According to a statement issued by the CPNE, Shah was shot by unidentified assailants on a motorcycle while sitting in his car outside the Lahore Press Club, according to Express Tribune Highlighting the failing "law-and-order situation" in the country, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) has condemned the killing of the Lahore journalist. "HRCP condemns the assassination of Capital TV journalist Hasnain Shah, who was killed in broad daylight on Davis Road in Lahore earlier today. This is yet another testament to the failing law-and-order situation and the increased vulnerability of journalists," the HRCP has said in a statement.

---||World||30 years of killing: Northern Ireland's 'Troubles'||LONDONDERRY, United Kingdom: Northern Ireland was torn apart by three decades of violence between nationalist and unionist communities that ended with the Good Friday Agreement signed 23 years ago. The province's majority Protestant unionists favoured continued British rule. Catholic republicans wanted equal rights and reunification with the rest of Ireland. Here is an overview of "The Troubles" during which more than 3,500 people were killed. Violence erupts in 1968 when police use force against a peaceful Catholic civil rights demonstration in Londonderry demanding an end to discrimination in voting, jobs and housing. The situation degenerates as Catholic meetings and demonstrations end in clashes with the police and Protestants. In August 1969 as sectarian violence grips the province, British troops are deployed. In 1970 a Catholic guerrilla group, the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA), begins a campaign of bombings and shootings against the troops. Unionist paramilitary groups respond, mostly by killing Catholics, further driving a wedge between the communities. Violence explodes after January 1972 when 13 people are killed on "Bloody Sunday" after British soldiers open fire on a peaceful Catholic civil rights march in Londonderry. One protester dies later. London suspends the Northern Ireland provincial government three months later, leading to decades of direct rule from the British capital. In 1974 the IRA extends the bombing campaign to Britain with attacks on pubs in Guildford, Woolwich and Birmingham that kill about 30 people in all. It also assassinates key British establishment figures including Queen Elizabeth II's cousin Lord Louis Mountbatten in rural northwest Ireland in 1979. On the same day 18 British soldiers are killed in an IRA ambush at Warrenpoint in Northern Ireland. A turning point comes in 1981 when IRA inmate Bobby Sands and nine comrades die on hunger strike at Maze Prison demanding political prisoner status. Their deaths draw global sympathy for the republican cause. The following year the IRA's political wing Sinn Fein wins its first seats in parliament. A year after Gerry Adams is elected party chief. The IRA continues to strike in England, with prime minister Margaret Thatcher narrowly escaping death in a bomb attack on the Grand Hotel in Brighton during the 1984 Conservative party conference in which five people die. Seven years later they attempt to assassinate her successor, John Major, in a mortar attack on 10 Downing Street. In 1992 and 1993 two massive bombings kill four people and cause major damage in the City of London financial hub. An attempt by Conservative Prime Minister Edward Heath to establish a power-sharing executive founders in 1973 after a unionist general strike. Thatcher signs an Anglo-Irish accord in 1985, acknowledging Dublin's say in Northern Ireland's affairs. Behind-the-scenes talks lead to an IRA ceasefire in 1994, which breaks down as negotiations stall. In July 1997, after Tony Blair becomes Labour prime minister, Sinn Fein gets a place at the negotiating table after the IRA declares a new ceasefire. The Good Friday Agreement is signed on April 10, 1998 between London, Dublin and the main Northern Ireland political parties. It leads to a new semi-autonomous Northern Ireland with a power-sharing government between Protestants and Catholics. The deadliest single atrocity of the period comes four months after the accord when 29 people are killed in the town of Omagh in a bomb planted by a dissident group, the Real IRA. The attack has the effect of bolstering, rather than undermining, the peace accord.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/30-years-of-killing-northern-irelands-troubles/articleshow/89146915.cms||---

The bridge round was led by early Google investor Ram Shriram through his venture capital firm Sherpalo Ventures and co-led by Wami Capital, existing investor and former WhatsApp chief business officer Neeraj Arora and former Google executive Amit Singhal. With this, Skyroot, which is the first startup with whom ISRO signed an MoU for sharing facilities and expertise, has so far raised $17 million, the largest by an Indian space startup yet, it said. The latest round comes after Skyroot raised $11 million in 2021 via a Series-A round led by Greenko founders with participation from publicly listed Solar Industries India Limited, WorldQuant Ventures, Graph Ventures, among others. The startup had also mopped up $1.5 million in mid-2018 in a seed round that was funded by Myntra founder Mukesh Bansal’s incubator Meraki Labs. Skyroot Aerospace co-founder and COO Naga Bharath Daka said: “This round helps us build critical infrastructure early-on and helps accelerate towards our launch this year. 2022 is going to be a big year for us and the entire Indian space ecosystem.” “In the last 18 months, we successfully demonstrated three cutting edge propulsion technologies used in our Vikram series of space launch vehicles, and this year will be a year of hypergrowth, where we will be testing our final rocket stages for a launch, while continuing to build a strong order book for the first few launches,” explained Skyroot Aerospace co-founder & CEO Pawan Kumar Chandana. “India has long been a leader in rocket launch capability, especially at significantly lower cost. Skyroot takes that technical strength to the next level, with its innovative and cost-effective space launch capability, disrupting the status quo in global launch market” said Ram Shriram, one of the first investors and board members of Google, and billionaire founder of venture capital firm Sherpalo Ventures that invests in promising new disruptive technologies. Chetan Mehta, CEO, Wami Capital said: “We have always backed innovative companies and Skyroot represents a classic story of homegrown disruptive innovation and strong execution by a team of young and dynamic Indian entrepreneurs with vision, grit and strong determination. Their mission to democratize space access will open up new areas of opportunities and will go a long way in contributing to India’s offering of a strong space ecosystem to the world.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/skyroot-aerospace-raises-4-5-million-via-bridge-round-led-by-early-google-investor-ram-shrirams-sherpalo-ventures/articleshow/89147969.cms||Swati Bharadwaj
---||World||No exit from zero-Covid: China struggles to find policy off-ramp||SHANGHAI: China's "zero-Covid" stance has put it at odds with the rest of the world and is exacting a mounting economic toll, but an exit strategy remains elusive as authorities worry about the ability of the healthcare system to cope and adapt to new strains. Chinese medical experts believed last year that higher vaccination rates would eventually allow China to relax tough rules on movement and testing as infection rates slow elsewhere. The emergence of the highly transmissible Omicron variant dashed those hopes. While some analysts have branded China's approach as "unsustainable", many local health experts - and some from overseas - say the country has no choice but to continue given its less developed health system. Some even argue China's economy could even emerge stronger than ever if it keeps Omicron at bay. "For a large country with a population of 1.4 billion, it must be said that the cost effectiveness of our country's prevention and control has been extremely high," said Liang Wannian, head of the expert epidemic prevention group at China's National Health Commission, at a Saturday briefing. Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, called on China last week to "reassess" its approach, saying it had now become a "burden" on both the Chinese and global economies. But China is concerned the cost of lowering its defences could prove even higher, especially with a healthcare system that has lagged its broader development. "With a large population and high density the government is rightly concerned about impacts for the spread of the virus," said Jaya Dantas, professor of international health at the Curtin School of Population Health in Perth, Australia. China had 4.7 million registered nurses at the end of 2020, or 3.35 per 1,000 people, official data showed. The United States has around 3 million - around 9 per 1,000. China is also wary of the risk of new variants, especially as it refuses to import foreign vaccines. Studies suggest China's vaccines are less effective against Omicron and it has not yet rolled out its own mRNA version. Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Center For Disease Control and Prevention, warned the "insidious" Omicron could still lead to a rise in the absolute number of deaths even if it was proven to be less deadly, and China must remain patient. "China's medical capacity and standards are not as good as Britain or the United States, but the results of China's coronavirus prevention and control are far, far superior," he said in a weekend interview with the Beijing News. 'PREMATURE OPTIMISM' China has stepped up its health warnings, urging citizens to ignore claims that Omicron is no more serious than the 'flu and to stay vigilant. On Wednesday, the Global Times, published by the official People's Daily, also lashed out at overseas media for "mocking" China's policies, saying they saved lives. Foreign criticism was "based on unfounded or premature optimism regarding the end of the pandemic", it added. Experts in China and overseas have also cast doubt on the hope that Omicron represents the final stage of the pandemic. "SARS-CoV-2 will not magically turn into a malaria-like endemic infection where levels stay constant for long periods," said Raina MacIntyre, head of the Biosecurity Research Programme at the University of New South Wales' Kirby Institute. "It will keep causing epidemic waves, driven by waning vaccine immunity, new variants that escape vaccine protection, unvaccinated pockets, births and migration," she told Reuters. END-GAME China's economy is expected to slow as a result of Covid related supply disruptions, while lockdowns to douse domestic outbreaks weigh on travel and consumption. Hong Kong's "zero-Covid" approach has put the Chinese-controlled city out of step with other global finance centres and is battering its economy. Still, China's economy has remained resilient, with GDP growth at 8.1% last year, far exceeding expectations. MacIntyre of the Kirby Institute said it wasn't a "binary choice" between opening up and remaining isolated, adding there was "no need to surrender to the virus, as Australia is doing at the moment." China could still emerge from the crisis in the strongest position, especially if Covid leads to widespread cognitive impairment, organ damage and other long-term conditions in other countries, she said. "If China keeps the virus largely under control, their population will be fit and healthy into the future, while the United States and Europe will be groaning under an unprecedented burden of chronic disease."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/no-exit-from-zero-covid-china-struggles-to-find-policy-off-ramp/articleshow/89148007.cms||---

"Apart from the poor and oppressed, the skilled and unskilled workers, unemployed youths, people who have been sacked from their job due to the dire state of the economy, businessmen, industrialists and farmers have also been suffering due to the current phase of "half income, double inflation". Actually, since the present government came into power, it has only brought difficulties and troubles," reads the letter written in Hindi by the SP chief. Uttar Pradesh former chief minister posted the letter on Twitter on the occasion of Republic Day on Wednesday. Yadav urged people to pledge on Republic Day to "save the constitution which led to the formation of this great republic." "To bring the positive change, let's move forward with the positive, progressive and practical politics that does not favour only a sect of people but takes everyone together," Yadav said. "This government has divided society into two parts. On one hand, there are people who are continuously getting richer and on the other hand, there are people who are continuously getting poorer. Even among the wealthy, only a few persons are cornering wealth. The middle class is getting crushed in the middle. Their savings and interest on which their future depends are also not safe in banks," he added. Reiterating the promise made by Samajwadi Party during the ongoing election campaigning for upcoming assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh, Yadav urged the people to elect his government and help them in making a "new UP". "We take a pledge to fulfill promises like 300 units of free electricity per household, free irrigation, MSP for all crops, guaranteed payment to sugarcane farmers within 15 days, interest-free loans, insurance, pension, Samajwadi pension of Rs 18,000 per year, laptop distribution to talented youths, 22 lakh new jobs in IT sector, filling up lakhs of vacant government jobs, restoring the pension scheme and caste census," the letter read. Meanwhile, elections for the 403 Assembly constituencies in Uttar Pradesh will be held in seven phases starting February 10. The polling in Uttar Pradesh will be held on February 10, 14, 20, 23, 27, and March 3 and 7. The counting of votes will take place on March 10.

---||World||China slams US over reported move of permitting departure of diplomatic staff||BEIJING: China on Wednesday expressed serious concern and dissatisfaction with the US over its reported move of allowing American diplomats and their families to leave the country to avoid Beijing's stringent anti-pandemic measures, terming it a “confusing” decision that will only expose US staff to "much greater risks" of infection. The US State Department is considering plans to approve its embassies and consulates to authorise the departure of their US employees in China, citing reasons for "China's epidemic situation", China's state-run Global Times reported on Tuesday, quoting a source familiar with the matter. The US move was possibly in response to concerns raised by its diplomats in China, the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported. Asked for his reaction to the report, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a media briefing here that China's anti-virus regulations were in line with international treaties governing the treatment of diplomatic personnel and that the country was “undoubtedly the safest country at present”. “Evacuating from the safest place in the world will only expose US personnel to much greater risks of infection. The logic behind the US' decision is confusing and hardly justifiable,” he said. China has expressed grave concern and dissatisfaction over this to the US side, he said. “We hope the US can observe China's Covid-19 protocols, take China's position and concerns seriously and think carefully about the so-called ‘authorised departure' of diplomatic and consular staff,” he said. China in recent weeks has stepped up measures as Beijing and several Chinese cities reported spikes in Covid-19 cases, especially that of Delta and Omicron variants ahead of the Winter Olympics, prompting the officials to test millions to control the spread of the virus. Defending the stringent measures Zhao said, “China's epidemic prevention and control protocols are rigorous and science-based. Our effective measures have well-protected foreign nationals in China”. Diplomatic sources here say that there is considerable wariness among foreign missions over China's stringent zero Covid-19 policy enforcing strict travel bans for nearly two years and restricting the movement of foreigners. Beijing is concerned over the American move as it adds gist to the US, the EU and other western countries' well-publicised plan to boycott the opening ceremony of the February 4 Beijing Winter Olympic games over the allegations of human rights violations against Uygur Muslims in Xinjiang province. China is also facing increasing international criticism over its aggressive military actions against Taiwan and in the South China Sea, allegations of human rights violation in Xinjiang, Hong Kong, and Tibet. China reported over 100 new Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, according to China's National Health Commission. Of the 24 locally transmitted cases, Beijing reported 14 infections. As of Tuesday, there were 2,487 patients still under treatment for Covid-19 in hospitals in different cities in the country, the Commission reported on Monday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/china-slams-us-over-reported-move-of-permitting-departure-of-diplomatic-staff/articleshow/89148233.cms||---

The company said while a third shot of its original coronavirus vaccine increased neutralizing antibodies against the variant at the lower dose, their levels declined six months after the booster dose was administered. However, neutralizing antibodies remained detectable in all participants, Moderna said. While studies have indicated that Omicron results in a less severe Covid-19 than seen during previous waves, the variant has quickly become dominant in many parts of the world, driving up infections and straining healthcare systems. The variant currently accounts for 99.9% of the Covid-19 cases in the Unites States. Pfizer and its partner BioNTech started a clinical trial on Tuesday to test a new version of their vaccine specifically tailored to the Omicron variant. Moderna said it would study its Omicron-specific booster in adults aged 18 years and older. It would test the booster in individuals who received only the two-dose primary series of Moderna's original vaccine, mRNA-1273, and also in those who received the primary series and a booster dose of the same vaccine, the company said. Moderna plans to enroll about 300 participants in each of the two groups in the study. Three studies, led by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have shown that a third dose of an mRNA vaccine, such as those from Pfizer and Moderna, is key to fighting the Omicron variant. read more Some countries have already started offering additional booster doses, but a recent study from Israel showed that while a fourth dose of an mRNA vaccine boosted antibodies, the level was not high enough to prevent an Omicron infection.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/moderna-starts-trial-for-omicron-specific-booster-shot/articleshow/89148191.cms||---

The driver of the car has been arrested, police said. "January 26 being a public holiday, people had thronged the Chinchani beach at Tarapur in large numbers in the evening. However, despite the crowd, a car came onto the beach, but its driver lost control while trying to save a scooter, due to which the four-wheeler ran into one of the food stalls.

---||World||One body found, 38 still missing from capsized migrant boat off Florida||MIAMI: Rescue crews recovered one body but hopes dimmed for 38 other people lost at sea over the weekend from a capsized boat off Florida's coast in an incident being treated as an ill-fated human smuggling attempt, the US Coast Guard said on Wednesday. The search-and-recovery operation stretched through a second full day on Wednesday as the Coast Guard reported intercepting a separate sailing vessel off the Bahamas overloaded with 191 Haitian migrants believed to be headed for Florida. The two incidents underscored a surge in migrants seeking passage to Florida in flimsy vessels through the Caribbean by way of the Bahamas, a known hub for sea-borne human smuggling. The Coast Guard said in a Twitter post that its teams would "continue to search throughout the night for the missing people" whose boat was reported by a lone survivor to have overturned in rough seas on Sunday morning. A Coast Guard spokesman, Petty Officer Jose Hernandez, acknowledged late Wednesday that chances of finding anyone else alive were dwindling but that officials would "reassess" the situation on Thursday morning. The survivor, found clinging to the overturned vessel on Tuesday, told authorities after his rescue that he was one of 40 people aboard the boat when it left the Bahamas' Bimini islands, about 50 miles (80 km) east of Miami, on Saturday night, the Coast Guard said. The vessel capsized the next morning about 45 miles (72 km) east of Fort Pierce Inlet, off Florida's Atlantic coast, about midway between Miami and Cape Canaveral. According to the survivor, nobody aboard had been wearing a life jacket. Their nationalities have not been released. But vessel crossings of Haitian migrants have grown more frequent as the Caribbean island nation faces worsening economic and political crises, as well as gang-related kidnappings. "We do suspect that this is a case of human smuggling, as this event occurred in a normal route for human smuggling," Coast Guard Commander Jo-Ann Burdian told a Miami news conference. Distraught survivorThe survivor was first spotted at around 8 am on Tuesday by crew members of a private tugboat who saw "there was somebody who was pretty distraught on the vessel," said Joshua Nelson, operations manager for the Jacksonville Fleet of Signet Maritime Corp, which owns the tug. "We were towing a very large barge that was roughly 2,500 feet behind us, so it (took) a little finesse to get close enough to the vessel and not cause any waves to knock the man off," Nelson said in a telephone interview. The crew immediately alerted the Coast Guard, Nelson said. The accident coincided with a small-craft advisory posted for the area warning of high winds and heavy seas, according to the Coast Guard. Thirty-two other people were rescued from a capsized vessel west of Bimini last Friday in yet another migrant crossing attempt gone awry. "The waters in the northern Florida Straits can be quite treacherous," Burdian said. "In cases like this, small vessels, overloaded, inexperienced operators, at night in bad weather can be incredibly dangerous." Through Wednesday morning, Coast Guard cutter crews, helicopter teams, search planes and a U.S. Navy air crew crisscrossed an area spanning more than 1,300 square miles (3,367 square km), about the size of Rhode Island, between Bimini and Fort Pierce Inlet, a Coast Guard statement said. Incidents of overturned or interdicted vessels crowded with people, many of them Haitians or Cubans seeking to reach the United States, are not uncommon in the waters off Florida. "There's (been) an increase in these human smuggling organizations" over the last year, Anthony Salisbury, special agent in charge of the Homeland Security Investigations office in Miami, said in a telephone interview. "These human smuggling organizations, you're dealing with criminals," Salisbury said. "They really prey on the migrant community." Last May, 12 Cuban migrants died and eight were rescued after their boat flipped over off Key West, Florida. At least 557 Cuban migrants and more than 800 Haitians have been picked up at sea by the Coast Guard since October, in addition to nearly 7,400 Cubans and 3,900 Haitians interdicted during the previous five years, according to the agency.

Organised between 1997 and 2015, Saifai Mahotsav was an annual cultural fair started in 1997 by Late Ranveer Singh Yadav, nephew of senior Samajwadi Party leader Mulayam Singh Yadav and father of Tej Pratap Singh Yadav (ex-MP from Mainpuri). It was renamed as Ranveer Singh Smriti Saifai Mahotsav after his death in 2002. The closing ceremony was a controversial event due to the participation of controversial personalities. In a tweet today, Adityanath wrote in Hindi, "The state is now identified with 'Divya Kumbh' and 'Grand Deepotsav', it will remain the same... Those who yearn to make the state's identity similar to 'Saifai Mahotsav' are now history, will remain a history..." This development holds significance as Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh will be conducted in seven phases starting on February 10. The second phase of the Uttar Pradesh elections will be on February 14, the third phase on February 20, the fourth phase on February 23, 5th phase on February 27, 6th phase on March 3 and 7th and the last phase will be conducted on March 7. The counting of votes for 403 assembly seats in Uttar Pradesh, 117 in Punjab, 70 in Uttarakhand 60 in Manipur and 40 in Goa will be done on March 10.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/those-who-yearn-to-equate-uttar-pradeshs-identity-with-saifai-mahotsav-wont-succeed-adityanath-slams-sp/articleshow/89148636.cms||---

Biden and Justice Stephen Breyer are expected to hold an event at the White House Thursday to formally announce Breyer's plans to retire, according to a person briefed on the planning who was not authorized to publicly discuss it in advance. Early discussions about a successor are focusing on U.S. Circuit Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, U.S. District Judge J. Michelle Childs and California Supreme Court Justice Leondra Kruger, according to four people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss White House deliberations. Jackson and Kruger have long been seen as possible nominees. Since Biden took office in January 2021, he has focused on nominating a diverse group of judges to the federal bench, installing five Black women on federal appeals courts, with three more nominations pending before the Senate. Other possible candidates for the high court could come from among that group, Biden aides and allies said, especially since almost all of the recent Supreme Court nominees have been federal appeals judges. ``He has a strong pool to select a candidate from, in addition to other sources. This is an historic opportunity to appoint someone with a strong record on civil and human rights,'' said Derrick Johnson, the NAACP's president. By the end of his first year, Biden had won confirmation of 40 judges, the most since President Ronald Reagan. Of those, 80% are women and 53% are people of color, according to the White House. Jackson, 51, was nominated by President Barack Obama to be a district court judge. Biden elevated her to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Early in her career, she was also a law clerk for Breyer. Childs, a federal judge in South Carolina, has been nominated but not yet confirmed to serve on the same circuit court. Her name has surfaced partly because she is a favorite among some high-profile lawmakers, including Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C. Kruger, a graduate of Harvard and Yale's law school, was previously a Supreme Court clerk and has argued a dozen cases before the justices as a lawyer for the federal government. Breyer, 83, will retire at the end of the summer, according to two sources who confirmed the news to The Associated Press on Wednesday. They spoke on condition of anonymity so as not to preempt Breyer's formal announcement. But the Senate can confirm a successor before there is a formal vacancy, so the White House was getting to work and it was expected to take at least a few weeks before a nomination was formalized. Biden said Wednesday he wasn't going to get ahead of Breyer's announcement. ``Every justice should have an opportunity to decide what he or she is going to do and announce it on their own,`` Biden said. ``Let him make whatever statement he's going to make and I'll be happy to talk about it later.'' When Biden was running for the White House, he said that if he had the chance to nominate someone to the court, he would make history by choosing a Black woman. And he's reiterated that pledge since. ``As president, I'd be honored, honored to appoint the first African American woman. Because it should look like the country. It's long past time,'' Biden said in February 2020 shortly before South Carolina's presidential primary. Adding a Black woman to the court would mean a series of firsts _ four female justices and two Black justices serving at the same time on the nine-member court. Justice Clarence Thomas is the court's only Black justice and just the second ever, after Thurgood Marshall. And Biden would have the chance to show Black voters increasingly frustrated with a president they helped to elect that he is serious about their concerns, particularly after he has been unable to push through voting rights legislation. At the same time, Breyer's replacement by another liberal justice would not change the ideological makeup of the court. Conservatives outnumber liberals by 6-3, and Donald Trump's three nominees made an already conservative court even more conservative. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Biden's nominee ``will receive a prompt hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee and will be considered and confirmed by the full United States Senate with all deliberate speed.'' But Republicans in particular remain upset about Justice Brett Kavanaugh's contentious 2018 hearing. Still, Democrats have the 50 votes plus a tiebreaker in Vice President Kamala Harris that they need to confirm a nominee. Republicans who changed the Senate rules during the Trump-era to allow simple majority confirmation of Supreme Court nominees appeared resigned to the outcome. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, an influential Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in a statement, ``If all Democrats hang together _ which I expect they will _ they have the power to replace Justice Breyer in 2022 without one Republican vote in support.`` Nonetheless, Democrats have also been unable to get all their members on board for Biden's social and environmental spending agenda or to move forward with a voting rights bill. As a senator, Biden served as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, overseeing six Supreme Court confirmation hearings from 1987 to 1995, including Breyer's. And one person who will be central to Biden's process is chief of staff Ron Klain, a former Supreme Court law clerk and chief counsel to that committee. Two other Black women whom Biden appointed to federal appeals courts are also seen as contenders: Holly Thomas, a longtime civil rights lawyer he named to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, and Candace Jackson-Akiwumi, a former public defender he named to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit. Biden could also choose someone from outside the judiciary, though that seems less likely. One contender would be the head of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Sherrilyn Ifill, 59. She has headed the fund since 2013 and has announced she is stepping down in the spring. The Supreme Court has had three women on it for more than a decade, since 2010, when Obama named Justice Elena Kagan to the court to replace the retiring John Paul Stevens. Kagan joined Obama's other nominee, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the court's first Latina justice, and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. When Ginsburg died in September 2020, Trump announced his choice of Amy Coney Barrett eight days later.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/at-least-3-judges-eyed-as-biden-mulls-supreme-court-pick/articleshow/89148402.cms||---

---||Business||How Fed hikes could affect mortgages, car loans, card rates||WASHINGTON: The Federal Reserve signaled plans to begin raising interest rates "soon" in a bid to tamp down inflation before it poses a serious risk to the US economy. A hike would be the first time the central bank has increased its benchmark lending rate in over three years. Lifting the borrowing costs consumers and businesses pay for loans has the effect of slowing economic activity, which in turn could curb inflation. But there are also concerns that it could put on the brakes too quickly. We asked Alexander Kurov, a finance professor at West Virginia University, and Marketa Wolfe, an economist at Skidmore College, to explain what the Fed is doing and what it means for you. 1. Why is the Fed raising interest rates?Short-term interest rates in the US are now essentially zero. The Fed quickly cut rates to zero at the beginning of the Covid-19 crisis in March 2020 in an attempt to soften the blow of the sharp recession that began that month as the US went into lockdown. As a reminder of how bad things were back then, over 40 million workers - a quarter of the American workforce - filed for unemployment in the first few months of the pandemic, a staggering number with no precedent in the job market. Although the recession was short-lived - lasting only two months - and the economy has mostly recovered, the Fed has kept rates at rock bottom because many workers and businesses still need support as the pandemic continues to rage. The big problem for the Fed now is that US consumer prices have surged. For 10 months in a row, inflation has been above the Fed's 2% target and reached an annual pace of about 7% in December. This is the highest rate of inflation recorded in the US in the last 40 years. High inflation means the prices people pay for goods and services are continually going up - especially for basic items like meat and gasoline, as well as for manufactured goods like cars. The Fed can ill afford to allow this to continue because if higher inflation becomes entrenched, it would damage the economy. And the longer it lasts, the harder - and more painful for consumers and businesses - it is going to be to bring it back to a more sustainable 2%. So the Fed has to act quickly before it's too late. 2. How does the Fed raise rates?The Fed sets a target range for what is called the "federal funds rate." This rate acts like a benchmark for all interest rates in the economy. While the Fed didn't specify a time when it plans to raise rates, analysts expect the first increase to come in March, probably by 0.25 percentage point. This would affect banks' cost of borrowing, which in turn slowly filters throughout the economy as lenders charge more for loans on homes, cars, businesses, college tuition and anything else you might want to buy with debt. Banks would also gradually increase the interest they offer on deposits and savings accounts. The Fed does not directly control all these other rates, and the exact path they will take is not completely predictable, but the overall trend will be up if the Fed keeps raising its target rate. Markets expect the Fed to raise interest rates at least two more times in 2022. 3. What does that mean for consumers and businesses?Put simply, higher interest rates mean borrowers would need to pay more for the loans they get. If the Fed lifts interest rates this year by 0.75 percentage point, as expected, this would translate into about US$45,000 in additional interest payments on a 30-year, $300,000 mortgage. So if you want to borrow to start a business, pay for college, buy a car or do anything else, you should expect your borrowing costs to be higher later this year. On the other hand, higher rates is good news for savers and investors, as their returns from activities like making deposits and buying bonds will go up. 4. And how will it affect the broader economy?Higher interest rates would likely slow down business activity. While this can help reduce inflation, it also means lower economic growth. The Fed always makes decisions based on what is happening in the economy and on how economic conditions are expected to change. And changes in the economy are often hard to predict. The biggest unknown at this point is what will happen to inflation later this year. This is uncertain because inflation is driven by multiple factors, such as supply chain shortages and strong demand. In addition, the labor force participation rate has still not recovered to pre-pandemic levels, and the economy is experiencing labor shortages, which could push wages and prices higher. If these Covid-19-related pressures don't ease up soon, inflation could continue to stay high or continue to accelerate, which may force the Fed to increase interest rates faster than currently expected. On the other hand, if economic or employment growth stalls, this will make it much harder for the Fed to raise rates without making things worse. The Fed will need to find the right balance between taming inflation and avoiding slowing down the economy too much.

The bullion trader, Uttam Kashyap, is learnt to have offered to settle the matter registered under section 420. Sources said Mahajan had been booked for cheating after cheques issued by him for purchasing two gold coins, weighing 15gm, had bounced. Sources in the police said Mahajan had been arrested by Tehsil police from Yavatmal in 2020 for posing as a scientist and cases of cheating. As the instant case was a compoundable offence, Kashyap had sought the court’s permission to settle the matter. The court had directed Kashyap and Mahajan to appear before the Lok Adalat and settle the matter. The court had later observed that since the victim had already got his valuables back, the case against Mahajan too was disposed of.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/cheating-case-resolved-amicably-in-lok-adalat/articleshow/89172712.cms||---

Many are concerned about the BA.2 sub variant of Omicron, which is already spreading in India and could extend the third wave peak in poll bound states due to elections and gatherings. The survey received 10,310 responses from citizens located in 292 districts of India including 3928 responses from districts in these 5 states. When citizens were asked a similar question regarding these state elections on January 9, 31% were in favour of postponing these state elections altogether, which has now increased to 55% in the January 24 survey. This indicates that as COVID cases positivity rates in poll-bound districts rise, an over 75% jump has been observed in the number of people who support that state elections be postponed. Majority believe gatherings and elections before the peak of the third wave could worsen COVID spread as already 40% of the districts in five poll-bound states, including Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Manipur and Goa now have a test positivity rate (TPR) of over 10%, which is only rising every week. At the state level, Uttar Pradesh witnessed a jump of 48% in the daily cases for the week ended on Jan 22 as compared to the previous week. The number for Punjab stands at 41%. In Punjab, 19 out of 22 districts have a TPR of more than 10%, with 8 of them having a TPR of over 20%. Similarly, 11 districts each in Manipur and Uttar Pradesh, 6 in Uttarakhand, and both in Goa have weekly TPR above 10%. At a country level, 52% of districts or 379 districts have a weekly positivity rate above 10% and that includes 40% of the districts in the 5 poll-bound states. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), a TPR below 5% means virus transmission is under some control, however, a number above this percentage means the rate of infection will rise. " The current term of State Assemblies of Uttarakhand, Punjab, Goa and Manipur are due to expire in mid-to late-March and that of Uttar Pradesh in mid-May. Given the feedback from people, we would like Election Commission to consider postponing the election date in the states of Uttarakhand, Punjab, Goa and Manipur by 2-3 weeks such that counting can still take place before the terms expire. In the case of Uttar Pradesh, a similar consideration may be given such that counting/results deadline can still be the same as other states but the polling phases are started at a later date than Feb 10th," said Sachin Taparia, Founder of LocalCircles.  The Election Commission on January 8 had banned political parties in the poll-bound states from holding roadshows and physical rallies until Jan 15, which was then extended till January 22. The Election Commission will again take stock of the situation and decide on physical rallies. The commission on January 17 had postponed the election in Punjab to February 20 due to the Guru Ravidas Jayanti celebrations in which 20 lakh voters were likely to miss polling. Elections in Goa, Uttarakhand, Manipur and Uttar Pradesh are set to commence from February 10th – March 10th. "Despite a ban by the Election Commission on rallies, if the elections dates are in February, it is likely to lead to gatherings of different types leading to worsening of the situation, which is something that is best avoided. In addition to that, the voter turnout is likely to be impacted. By moving polling dates to early March where possible, both these issues can be addressed”, said Taparia.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/55-citizens-want-state-polls-to-be-postponed-amid-rising-covid-cases-survey/articleshow/89148963.cms||Sunainaa Chadha

The fresh cases pushed the tally in the northeastern state to 60,792, he said. Altogether, 57,199 people have recovered from the disease so far, state surveillance officer Dr Lobsang Jampa said. The recovery rate among coronavirus patients is currently at 94.09 per cent, he said. The death toll in the frontier state remained at 284 as no fresh fatality due to the infection was reported in the last 24 hours, the SSO said. Of the 194 new cases, 114 were registered in the Capital Complex Region, 18 in Papumpare district and 10 in Lower Subansiri, the official said. An army jawan, two healthcare workers and 10 inmates of the Central Jail here were among the new patients, Jampa said. The northeastern state had on Wednesday registered 526 fresh infections. Arunachal Pradesh currently has 3,309 active cases. The Capital Complex Region, comprising Itanagar, Naharlagun, Nirjuli and Banderdewa areas, has the highest number of active cases at 1,408, followed by West Kameng at 220, Namsai at 195, Papumpare at 188 and Lower Subansiri at 171.

---||Business||Domestic investors prop up Indian stocks as foreigners flee||NEW DELHI: Foreign investors have been cutting their holdings of Indian equities over the past few months, but domestic mutual funds, banks and insurance companies have helped put a floor under the market with their buying.  According to the data from National Stock Exchange of India, foreigners have sold $7.24 billion between Oct. 1 and Jan. 25, but domestic Indian institutions purchased $9.63 billion in that period.  Analysts said the rise in domestic investments is due to the surge in retail interest in the equity markets as the country's young investors pick stocks over other traditional assets.  "People start to see rising incomes and put more money in investments for their future and there is a greater willingness to hold assets like equities. A few decades ago most people would only save in cash, jewelry or gold and property," said Herald van der Linde, chief Asia equity strategist at HSBC.  "Hence, we see continued buying from retail investors. They buy ETFs, funds and pick stocks themselves too."  Data from Association of Mutual funds in India showed funds amassed 328 billion Indian rupees ($4.38 billion) through systematic investment plans (SIPs) in the fourth quarter of 2021, which was 40% higher than a year before.  SIPs are more popular among retail investors as they allow them to invest a fixed amount regularly, and their returns are less volatile than lump sum discretionary stock investments.  This domestic support could protect Indian markets against global volatility as the US Federal Reserve gets set to raise interest rates rapidly in efforts to combat higher inflation.  Many emerging market stock indexes have slumped in the past few weeks as foreigners aggressively sold riskier markets, while chasing higher US yields and preparing for a hit to earnings.  However, India's Nifty 50 index has shed just 2% so far this month, compared with MSCI Asia-Pacific index's decline of 5%.  Some analysts said India's higher stock valuations could deter foreign investors, but domestic investors would continue to accumulate shares.  According to Refinitiv data, India's large and mid-cap stocks' forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio stood at 20.1, the highest in Asia.  "In India alternative assets to hedge inflation are difficult to find, which, we believe, explains investors' liking for equities," said Manishi Raychaudhuri, Asia-Pacific equity strategist at BNP Paribas.  "That situation seems unlikely to change in the medium term, implying that domestic institutional investment flows could continue to remain a bulwark to the market."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/domestic-investors-prop-up-indian-stocks-as-foreigners-flee/articleshow/89150042.cms||---

While the current tax slabs have not changed in the last seven years, inflation has reduced the purchasing power of money. Yet outright changes in the rates/ slabs on direct or indirect taxes (GST is under the purview of the GST council) are not expected to be a part of the Budget. However, amid the third wave of Covid-19 pandemic and serious concerns about inflation, people are looking for a budget that can help in creation of more jobs, bring down the prices of essential commodities, and improve their overall quality of living. 1 Deduction for life insurance premium, medical insurance & house rent allowance under new tax regimeCurrently, majority of the taxpayers are still opting for the old tax regime since tax liabilities are more beneficial compared to new tax regime and therefore compliance burden of filing detailed tax forms still exists. "To make new tax regime more attractive to the taxpayers, familiar deductions claimed by individual taxpayers i.e. deduction on account of house rent allowance, life insurance premium & medical premium to be allowed as deduction while computing tax in accordance with new tax regime since these investments are primarily done not for tax savings but for risk covers and house rent allowance is part of salary structure provided by most of the employers," says Maneet Pal Singh, Partner, IP Pasricha and Co. 2. Provide One-Time Deduction For CovidDue to Covid-related hospitalisation and treatment costs, which may have caused taxpayers enormous financial strain in 2021, it is requested to grant a special one-time deduction of Rs 1 lakh, says Adhil Shetty - CEO - Bankbazaar.com. Even Archit Gupta of Clear thinks the government could provide a special COVID expense related deduction under Section 80D or 80DDB to provide tax relief for COVID-19 patients and their families. 3. Work from home allowance:"The Budget may introduce tax-free work from home allowances for salaried employees. Allowing deductions for such expenses will raise the take-home salary, ultimately creating demand for goods and services in the country," says Archit Gupta, CEO Clear. Due to the high direct tax collection this fiscal year, there may be a scope to increase tax deduction limits. For instance, the standard deduction available to those with salary income may be raised, currently at Rs.50,000. This may be adjusted for inflation every year. Standard deduction of Rs 40,000 was introduced in 2018 and it was later enhanced to Rs 50,000 in the interim budget for 2019. The demand for a higher standard deduction limit comes at a time when household expenses have gone up because of inflation. 4. Increasing limits under section 80C Section 80C and Section 80D:A high direct tax collection during this fiscal year may help with upward revision of these limits. A higher deduction under Section 80C may be permitted for the Equity-Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS), or a separate limit can be defined to encourage more mutual fund investments in India. "The threshold for various allowances and deductions have been set out very many years ago and have remained unchanged. An increase in such thresholds is overdue for eg, the threshold for deduction under Section 80C is capped to Rs 1.5 lakh in the year 2014 and remains the same even after 8 years. The cap for few of the allowances like the child education allowance, conveyance allowance, etc has been unchanged for decades and completely out of sync with today’s reality of costs in this regard. Likewise, cap of Rs 2 lakh on deduction for home loan interest is impractical given the rising property prices," says Rahul Charkha, Partner, Economic Laws Practice.  Moreover, there are many taxpayers for whom the section 80C limit get exhausted with their EPF & housing loan principal repayment. 5 Deductions for higher education savings: In India, generally a person spends 1/3rd of income on education of children so saving for children's higher education is an important financial goal for any individual and a portion of income is generally earmarked for such savings. " Currently, there is no express deduction/exemption for such savings except the Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana, which is specifically for a girl child. The tax benefits are also not substantial as the deduction is clubbed within the section 80C limit of Rs 1.5 lakh annually. Such deduction encompasses various other tax-saving investments/expenditures (such as Employees' Provident Fund, Public Provident Fund, principal repayment of housing loan, children's tuition fee, National Savings Certificate, etc.), leaving limited headroom for claiming the deduction for higher education savings," says Anand Chatrath, Managing Partner at B M Chatrath& Co LLP. Moreover, to encourage millennials to invest in their education, some suggest that the budget could incentivize investments in education. "A new section of investments for education can be earmarked as tax saving schemes. In the absence of deductions, education investments can be exempted from long term capital gains with checks and balances in place to curb any misuse. Such measures will certainly result in higher returns for all stakeholders in the economy," said Sujith Narayanan, Co-Founder, Fi Neo Bank. 6. Deduction for Medical expenditure u/s 80D: Section 80D allows a deduction for medical expenses only if incurred on the medical treatment of a senior citizen not covered under health insurance. In other words, no deduction is allowed if the amount is incurred on medical treatment of: a) A person who is not a senior citizen; or b) A person who is covered under a health insurance policy. "Though senior citizens are more vulnerable to the coronavirus, it has indeed infected and hospitalized people of all age groups. It is requested that the government expand the scope of section 80D to allow a deduction for expenditure incurred on covid treatment of every person, irrespective of age," said Chatrath. According to Shetty, policy premiums have also increased during the pandemic, which is why he recommends that deductions for non-senior citizens under 80D should be doubled to Rs 50,000 to allow all families to avail higher coverage to shield against hospitalisation costs. Section 80DDB allows deduction of a certain amount in case of medical treatment. The section has a list of diseases for which you can claim this deduction. Critical illnesses like heart problems, cancer, neurological diseases, renal failure are included.  " The scope can definitely be increased to at least include complications from covid. This list hasn’t been revised for a long time and the changing health scene in the country means this list merits a relook. Rather than complicating matters for taxpayers, the Government can simply ask them to attach relevant reports in the income tax return itself so that it becomes easy to cross check and allow this deduction. The family must not be asked to provide excess proof for medical treatment," says CA Niyati Mavinkurve who is also a co-founder of Let's Make You Rich.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/simpler-tax-regime-to-covid-deduction-what-the-common-man-wants-from-budget-2022/articleshow/89149868.cms||Sunainaa Chadha

During Republic Day celebrations, that is what happens everywhere. But in Nalgonda town, it happens everyday. It has been happening for the last one year. At 8. 30 am, as the national anthem is heard at 12 places across the town, traffic came to a grinding halt. People stop where they are. For the next 52 seconds, they stand in attention. In the next one month or so, residents of Tipparthi, close to Nalgonda town, will stop as soon as the national anthem is played. In a couple of months or so, this will be introduced in at least another four places surrounding the town. “It was an idea that we borrowed from Jammikunta where the national anthem is played everyday,” said Karnati Vijay Kumar, president of Jana Gana Mana Utsava Samithi. Healong with like-minded people introduced this ritual on January 23, 2021, in the town with then SP and DIG AV Ranganath appreciating them for their idea. Before the anthem is played, volunteers of the samithi hold aloft the national flag at different junctions. “As I was standing, two kids camefrom a nearby lane and saluted when the national anthem was being played,” a doctor Jaya Prakash Reddy said. He posted a photograph of the boys on social media. The doctor noticed the boys near Seetharamachandra Swamy temple at Ramagiri in Nalgonda town which is one of the places where the loudspeakers were arranged.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/as-soon-as-national-anthem-is-played-nalgonda-stops-in-its-tracks/articleshow/89150062.cms||Ch Sushil Rao
---||Business||What the healthcare sector expects from Union budget 2022||NEW DELHI: The Union budget 2022 is set to be presented on 1 February with different industries, individuals and others around the country anticipating changes in their respective areas. The healthcare sector will be one of the most critical sectors to be in focus this year. The experts believe that the government, which had rightly placed health and well-being as the first of the six pillars in the Union budget 2021, is expected to continue the focus in 2022 as well. Outlay for healthcare infra should be increased furtherSince the hospital sector is at the forefront as Covid cases in India surge again, facilities in tier 2-3 towns need to be equipped with diagnosis centers, ventilators, ICUS, critical care facilities and oxygen plants, said Dr Ashutosh Raghuvanshi, managing director and CEO at Fortis Healthcare. "There is an urgent need to allocate a separate budget for a national campaign around preventive health, testing and screening as these are key to reduce the overall disease burden in India," Raghuvanshi said. He also highlighted the fact that healthcare should be accorded priority status so that the sector can derive benefit from the GST transition and providers and healthcare service delivery institutions can avail loans at lower rates and extended tenure. "It is also essential that the government reduces duty and cess for critical care and life-saving equipment and drugs to reduce costs for both providers and patients." Investment across all the segments requiredAs the sector is on its way to recovering from the setback of the pandemic, greater investment across all the segments will encourage organisations to expand their capacities, said V Ashok, CFO at ACG, one of the leading pharma manufacturers. "Bringing in new investments, incentivizing & supporting existing organisations with forward-looking policies, deduction in duties and reducing GST will bring down the overall cost of healthcare services which will benefit a large section of people in the country and encourage organisations to invest more in R&D," said Ashok. Considering, India is the largest exporter of pharma products, the government may look at providing appropriate RoDTEP rates to pharma products exported by the industry to encourage drug exports, he added. Sector has not been able to derive benefits of GST transitionDr Harsh Mahajan, president at the Healthcare Federation of India, believes the embedded taxes in the sector have increased in the post-GST regime compared to the pre-GST scenario. Therefore, it is vital to rationalise GST to unlock the embedded credit which is trapped in the healthcare value chain, he said. Hoping govt to take some key fiscal stepsThe Indian healthcare system has been dealing with its biggest challenge. In this context, Sanjay Vinayak, Founder and CEO at Connect and Heal, hopes that the government will take some key fiscal steps, beginning with simplification of GST conditions for all healthcare providers. "Any organization delivering, facilitating, or coordinating healthcare services should be provided exemption from GST even if they are not clinical establishments themselves. Streamlining of these issues is critical for modern healthcare companies," he said. Apart from this, the primary healthcare sector continues to suffer from financial challenges, Vinayak said, "There is a need to qualify primary healthcare credit as priority sector lending for Banks. This is essential as the private sector needs to invest heavily into building a robust infrastructure. Another important area to focus is lower tax regime for the healthcare sector to encourage capital inflow. Indian pharma industry needs competitive advantageThe Indian pharma industry needs a competitive advantage to move up in the value chain and become a global leader in pharmaceuticals, said Hitesh Windlass, managing director of Windlass Biotech. This requires a push from the government to encourage indigenous manufacturers to do more R&D, especially in the areas of unmet need, and be able to invest in capacity building, he added. Higher tax deductions for R&D expenses will encourage even more investment in the development of new pharmaceuticals, Windlass said. "During the pandemic, India emerged as a leader in Covid-19 vaccine manufacturing and development because of years of efforts of our scientists and innovators in disease prevention. There is now a critical need for investment from govt in building infrastructure and adoption of digital technology to achieve its vision of self-reliance. With support from the Govt., India can emerge as an innovation hub in next five years," he said. The focus on healthcare has been at unprecedented levels in the recent yearsThe increased allocation of funds in last year’s budget alongside the recent commitment of Rs 64,000 crores towards healthcare over the next five years is a testament to the government’s focus on strengthening the health infrastructure in the country, said country managing director of Boehringer Ingelheim India, Vani Manja. "I expect this will be reflected in the upcoming budget as well." "What will be critical to ensure is not only increased expenditure towards healthcare but also a well-planned and balanced allocation coupled with a strong execution roadmap that addresses areas beyond Covid-19 to secure long-term sustainable impact. Specifically, the burden on the healthcare infrastructure caused by the increasing burden of NCDs should continue to be considered," she added. "It would also be important to incentivize investments in Research and Development for India to become an attractive innovation hub and maximize access to innovation for patients in India,” Manja said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget/sector-impact/healthcare/what-the-healthcare-sector-expects-from-union-budget-2022/articleshow/89150182.cms||Sonali Verma

Kejriwal said that the target is to install flags at 500 locations in Delhi, in first phase. "Our aim is that everyone shall be able to see the national flag 2-3 times a day when they leave their home or go to the office. Sometimes we forget our country, society. These flags will give us a sense of patriotism, country, and those who sacrificed everything for freedom," said Kejriwal. The chief minister said that he has been told that Delhi is the only city in the world where so many 115-feet-high national flags are installed, adding, "We are examining if it qualifies for Guinness World record." Earlier, five flags were installed on August 15 in Kidwai Nagar, Patparganj, Rani Bagh, Kalkaji and Dwarka areas. On Wednesday, tweeting a 2-minute long video, minister Satyendar Jain had said that the move will inculcate the feeling of patriotism and pride among the citizens. The government initially allocated Rs 45 crore as the Deshbhakti budget for the installation of 35m-high flags, which was later revised to Rs 84 crore. Officials said the spending was now estimated at Rs 104.4 crore.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/delhi-cm-arvind-kejriwal-unfurls-115-feet-high-national-flags-at-75-spots/articleshow/89150138.cms||---

---||Business||Budget 2022: 5 steps FM should take to make healthcare more accessible & affordable||By Bhanu Prakash Kalmath SJ and Karan KakkarThe Covid-19 pandemic has been a challenging time for all of us, be it the individuals, the governments or the communities at large across the world. The two waves gone by and the ongoing wave of the pandemic have put our frontline workers and healthcare infrastructure to a big test. Government has ensured to accord a high priority to the sector and has been dedicating significant resources to strengthen the healthcare infrastructure in the country. However, given the evolving scenario, there is always room for improvement for the healthcare sector to become better with processes, and world-class in delivery. Here're our expectations from the government for the healthcare sector in the upcoming budget. Increase public expenditure on healthcareThe foremost expectation from the budget would be an increase in the public expenditure on healthcare with the underlying principle of Availability, Accessibility and Affordability. The expenditure should be increased to 3% of GDP over the next few years for us to reach a reasonable milestone of Atmanirbhar healthcare system. It is critical to build more capacity, especially in semi-urban & rural areas and for vulnerable sections, such as children, senior citizens, economically weaker sections, and people with chronic conditions. An increase in the vaccination budget should also be prioritised. Promote investments to address gapsTo address critical gaps, the budget needs to lay out measures that catalyse investments in physical and digital healthcare infrastructure. While the sector is expected to grow and reach $372 billion in 2022 driven by increasing health awareness, rise in lifestyle diseases, growing uptake of preventive healthcare and increasing penetration of insurance, provisions are required to attract private investments especially in semi urban and rural areas. The government may consider innovative public-private partnership models, beneficial tax rates and weighted-tax deductions on capital expenditure. Income tax holidays for investments in rural areas and viability gap funding for hospitals in smaller cities would increase Ayushman Bharat provider base and encourage investments across India. Further, allowance for the healthcare sector to carry forward losses and unabsorbed depreciation on mergers under section 72A of the Income Tax Act, 1961 can also be proposed. Moreover, the budget also needs to address our low doctor-patient and nurse-patient ratio. Capacity expansion and creation of new medical colleges should be promoted to build a large pool of well-trained medical professionals in the country, along with skill development initiatives in allied healthcare services. Reduce out-of-pocket expenditure and make healthcare affordableIndia ranks high on out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPE) on healthcare. Measures to bring down this OOPE and make healthcare more affordable will be a big relief for the citizens. Chapter VI-A of the Income Tax Act, 1961 includes deductions for the amount paid towards medical insurance and preventive health check-up. The capping limit of said deductions can be enhanced to encourage health insurance coverage along with preventive healthcare. Further, co-pay-based insurance can be promoted for middle-income groups to ease OOPE which may generally not get covered in the subsidised health services supported by the government. Additionally, healthcare services are currently exempt from levy of the Goods and Services Tax (GST). Consequently, tax paid on inward supply is not available as input tax credit and the same is forming part of the cost of healthcare services which is ultimately borne by the patients. Government should consider moving healthcare services to zero-rating. It will ensure eligibility of input tax credit which may help to reduce the cost of said services and a refund of unutilised input tax credit should also be allowed to provide additional working capital to the industry players. This measure will ultimately benefit the end consumers to access quality healthcare facilities at affordable prices. Similar practice has been considered by other major countries under its GST legislation, thus the government may look to adopt the same best practices and align itself to global tax policies. The government may consider pulling out input tax credit for expenses incurred for health and life insurance taken by employer for its employees from the list of blocked credits even if it is not obligatory for an employer under any law for the time being in force. While the government’s initiatives such as the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme to encourage domestic manufacturing of medical devices are a welcome move for Atmanirbhar Bharat, the government may consider reducing custom duties for advanced medical equipment and technology where we currently have a gap. Accelerate Digital AdoptionTechnology will be a great tool to enable access to healthcare services in remote areas and minimize the pressure on healthcare system. Further, it can also be leveraged to bring down the cost of service. Government should encourage the HealthTech industry and innovation in related areas. Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission is a progressive step towards the creation of integrated digital health infrastructure in the country. Under the mission, every citizen will get a digital health ID and will inter-connect the digital health solutions of hospitals across the country. We need more of such initiatives that enable the digital transformation of healthcare across the country. All these measures can play an important role in the next union budget which may improve the overall operational efficiency of the healthcare sector. Promote ExportsThe Service Exports from India Scheme (SEIS) was introduced by the Government of India in the Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) 2015-2020. The benefits under this scheme have already been notified till FY 2019-20 wherein health-related and social services are one of the categories which are eligible for the SIES scheme. Government should consider introducing similar incentive schemes for this sector in the next Foreign Trade Policy as well as promote medical & wellness tourism and make it competitive globally. Hopefully, the budget builds on the momentum achieved and adopts a multi-dimensional approach for the holistic development of the healthcare sector in India.

The court adjourned the case after the prosecution sought more time for analysing the digital evidence in connection with the probe. The actor has moved a bail plea in connection with the case against him and five others for allegedly threatening officials probing into the sexual assault of an actress in 2017. Counsel for Dileep then submitted that the interim order preventing his arrest may continue till the date of the next hearing. The court, after taking the views of the prosecution, extended the validity of the interim order till February 2. Last Saturday, the court had granted interim protection to Dileep from arrest. As per the court's directive, Dileep and the other accused had appeared before the investigating officers on January 23, 24 and 25 for interrogation. The accused was directed to fully cooperate with the investigation. The court had said director Balachandra Kumar, who had recently made some startling revelations against the actor, was an acquaintance of Dileep and has submitted some relevant material to the crime branch which led to the registering of the case. Besides Dileep, his younger brother P Sivakumar and brother-in-law T N Suraj have also moved the court seeking the same relief. On January 9, the Crime Branch registered the case on a complaint filed by an investigating officer based on a purported audio clip of Dileep, which was telecast by a TV channel in which the actor was allegedly heard conspiring to attack the official. The actor and five others were booked under various provisions of the IPC, including Sections 116 (abetment), 118 (concealing design to commit offense), 120B (criminal conspiracy), 506 (criminal intimidation), and 34 (criminal act done by several people). This apprehension is borne out of the past conduct of the complainant officer who from the start has been trying to falsely implicate the actor in the sexual assault case, the petition alleged. The actress-victim who has worked in Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam films was abducted and allegedly molested in her car for two hours by some of the accused, who had forced their way into the vehicle on the night of February 17, 2017 and later escaped in a busy area. The entire act was filmed by some of the accused to blackmail the actress. There are 10 accused in the case and police arrested seven. Dileep was arrested subsequently and released on bail.

The 70-kilometer (45-mile) stretch of highway is flanked by snow-swept hills. Occasionally a driver slows his car and shoves an Afghani note into the 28-year-old woman's bare, dirt-caked hand. She sits for hours on the highway medium, positioned just beyond a bump in the road that slows traffic. Her 16-year-old sister, Khalida, sits nearby. Both are hidden behind encompassing blue burqas. By the end of the day, Gulnaz, who gave just the one name, says they might make 300 Afghanis ($2.85). But most days it is less. The Taliban's sweep to power in Afghanistan in August drove billions of dollars in international assistance out of the country and sent an already dirt-poor nation, ravaged by war, drought and floods, spiraling toward a humanitarian catastrophe. But in recent weeks it is the bitter winter cold that is devastating the most vulnerable and has international aid organizations scrambling to save millions from starving or freezing because they have neither food nor fuel. For the poorest the only heat or means of cooking is with the coal or wood they can scrounge from the snowy streets or that they receive from aid groups. “The extent of the problem now in Afghanistan for people is dire,” said Shelley Thakral, spokeswoman for the World Food Program in Afghanistan. "We're calling this a race against time. We need to get to families in very difficult, hard to reach areas. It's winter, it's cold, the snow." The cost of the humanitarian effort is staggering. Thakral said the WFP alone will need $2.6 billion this year. “Break that number down. That's $220 million a month, that's 30 cents per person per day, and that's what we're asking for. . . . We need the money because we need to reach people as quickly as we can," she said. Earlier this month the United Nations launched its largest single country appeal for more than $5 billion to help a devastated Afghanistan. It's estimated that roughly 90 percent of Afghanistan's 38 million people are dependent on aid and the U.N. says nearly 3 million are displaced in their own country, driven from their homes by drought, war and famine. In 2020 alone, 700,000 Afghans became displaced, many living in desperate conditions on the outskirts of cities, in parks and open spaces, wherever they could erect a makeshift shelter. Gulnaz migrated to central Logar province from the northern province of Kunduz, where her husband had been a shoemaker. But his work dried up with war and the coming of the Taliban and “we have come here," she said as she sat with her sister on the side of the highway linking Logar's capital, Pul-e-Alam, with Kabul. "We have no heat at home and every day whether it is raining or snowing we come and sit here," she said. In Pul-e-Alam, where temperatures in January and February can drop to lows of minus-16 degrees Celsius (3 degrees Fahrenheit), thousands of men and women line up in the bitter cold to collect a World Food Program ration of flour, oil, salt and lentils. The WFP surveyed the city for the neediest, giving each a voucher to collect their rations, but word spread quickly through the snow- and mud-covered streets that food was being distributed and soon scores of men and women pushed and pleaded for rations. Fights broke out among some in the crowd and security forces tried to cordon those without vouchers off to one side. Each day for a week this month the WFP distributed rations to as many as 500 families a day, said Hussain Andisha, who manages the distribution. Most people in Logar province are desperate, he said. As he spoke, four women in burqas slipped past the men at the gate taking vouchers. None had a ration card, but they pleaded for food. One woman, who gave her name only as Sadarat, said her husband was a drug addict — a devastating problem that has mushroomed in the past two decades, with as many as 1 million people, or 8% of Afghanistan's population, counted as addicts, according to the U.N. Afghanistan produces over 4,000 tons annually of opium. the raw material used to make heroin. “I don't know where he is. I have no food for my children. Please I need something,” she said. Like hundreds of thousands of Afghans, poverty and conflict drove Sadarat and her five children from their rural home in Logar province's Charkh district to the capital, 38 kilometers (24 miles) away. Shouting from behind Sadarat, another women, Riza Gul, said she has 10 children and a husband who earns less than $1 a day as a laborer on the days he can find work. “What can we do? Where can we go?” she pleaded. Andisha said the January distribution would provide staples to 2,250 families in Pul-e-Alam, the capital of roughly 23,000 people. Already the WFP has surveyed the seven districts of Logar province and begun distribution in four. Roads are deep in snow and passage for the hundreds of trucks transporting the food is slow going and can be treacherous.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/in-freezing-afghanistan-aid-workers-rush-to-save-millions/articleshow/89150944.cms||---
---||World||No chance of reduction in inflation for another three months: Pak finance minister||ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Federal Minister of Finance Shaukat Tarin has said that there will be no decline in the price-hike in the country for the next three months. The News International reported quoting Tarin said that the prices have swelled all over the globe due to the COVID-19 pandemic but Pakistan didn't let its industries stop working. "The prices hiked up to 90 per cent in the international market. Trade deficit increased due to the rise in oil prices while the Afghan crisis weighed down Pakistan's currency," Tarin said during a press conference in Islamabad at the Pak-China Centre on Wednesday. He said the current account deficit would recede in the remaining months of the current fiscal year because the government had procured vaccines and there were no more requirements for importing wheat and sugar, The News International reported, adding him saying "The government had imported wheat and sugar to the tune of 1 billion USD." The Pakistan Minister hoped that the exports target of 31 billion USD and IT exports would fetch 3.5 billion USD during the current fiscal year. The remittances, he said, were going up by 11 per cent so far against the 29 per cent growth achieved in the last fiscal year, the media outlet said. In early January, the country's Finance Minister tabled the Finance (Supplementary) Bill 2021 also called as 'mini-budget' in the Senate amid protest from opposition members. The bill seeks to amend certain laws on taxes and duties to meet the International Monetary Fund's (IMF's) conditions for the clearance of Pakistan's sixth review of the USD 6 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) by the financial institution, paving way for the disbursement of a tranche of around USD 1 billion. With the supplementary finance bill and the State of Bank of Pakistan Autonomy Bill, the Pakistan government aims to meet certain conditions set by the IMF. Earlier, increasing inflation has forced the Pakistan government in deferring the approval of the Rs 360 billion mini-budget.

Dr Girish Rao, president at Medical Research Foundation, Chennai, explains that as women generally live longer than men and age related macular degeneration is commonly seen in elderly population, the prevalence is found to be more in women. “Additionally, the condition is more prevalent in rural women, perhaps due to the exposure to nitrous compounds released by burning of biomass that’s used for cooking,” he says. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is an eye disorder that affects the overall retinal functioning thus impacting one’s vision. Women are reported to be more susceptible to AMD compared to men and it affects people who are in their 50s and 60s. As per studies, it is the most common cause of significant irreversible vision loss among the elderly. It is progressive and causes a gradual deterioration of the macula – the part of the retina that is responsible for central vision. While AMD does not cause total blindness, it can make everyday activities such as reading and recognizing faces particularly difficult, says Dr Rao. Some of the symptoms include blurry vision, varying colour perception, momentary loss of vision. Other symptoms could include seeing straight lines as wavy or crooked, objects appearing smaller than normal, and colours looking less bright than they used to. Without treatment, AMD could cause vision to become worse over many years or even quickly over a few weeks or months.  “There is a need for public awareness and education via health seminars, and dissemination of necessary information via media outlets. Women who are more susceptible to AMD and see early signs should ensure regular eye examination, consume a rich and healthy diets with natural vegetables and fruits, monitor their blood pressure and lipid profile, avoid the consumption of alcohol and cigarettes, and use home amslers charting. Regular eye checkups are a must, since early detection is the only way to help in better prevention, management, and rehabilitation of patients with AMD,” says Dr Rao. Adds Dr Ajay Dudani, CEO Vitreoretinal Surgeon, Mumbai Retina Centre, “The risk factors in women are age, smoking, family history and race. Reversing the vision loss from macular degeneration is not possible but retaining the remaining vision can be done with accurate treatment with anti VEGF intravitreal injections and regular checks with the ophthalmologist.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/why-age-related-macular-degeneration-affects-women-more-than-men/articleshow/89151183.cms||Kamini Mathai

The authority has declared the equipment at the Hrazdan Thermal Power Plant (TPP) obsolete and inefficient, as it produces expensive electricity. Hrazdan Thermal Power Plant is a natural gas-fired power plant in the north-western part of Hrazdan in Armenia. It is one of the largest power plants in Armenia. The authority has decided to shut down the old thermal power plant in the future. The TPP would be soon decommissioned and the government has instead decided to rent it out to profitable industrial companies including cryptocurrency mining enterprises. The premises and infrastructure, including power lines, water and gas pipelines of the Hrazdan thermal plant will be provided to other businesses. In this regard, the authority will invite miners to install their coin minting hardware in the old thermal plant. The miners have also welcomed the step to install data centers at the old thermal power plant in the country. For the uninitiated, this ZebPay blog explains in simple words how crypto mining works. CryptocurrencyLiveMining facilities will have to access sufficient electrical energy even after the Hrazdan TPP is decommissioned, Bitcoin.com reported. Besides, a new thermal power plant with four power generating units, Hrazdan-5, has been built close to the old TPP by the Russian giant Gazprom. Armenia currently has three modern thermal power stations, with the state-run TPP Yerevan. However, the electricity generated by these thermal plants is way more expensive than the energy produced by hydroelectric power plants and the Armenian nuclear power station in the west of the capital city.

"We will come out with the green hydrogen policy in the next 10 days. We will give free transmission for 25 years. So you can generate power for making hydrogen in Rajasthan or transport it to Guwahati or to Baruni refinery (to make hydrogen)," said Singh while addressing a virtual conference on smart metering organised by industry body CII. The minister also said that the policy will feature dollar denominated bids, offer of land in renewable energy parks and land allocation near ports for creating bunkers for green hydrogen or ammonia. "We want India to emerge as the exporter for green hydrogen... Japan wants to import and Germany also," Singh said. Raising the issue of payment for power supply, he said free power supply ultimately affects the entire value chain. "If he (politician or public representative) wants to give 100 units free then he can do so from the budget. We don't mind that. He can give entire taxpayers' money for free electricity or water but then he would not be left with funds for development of roads and other works." The minister was of the view that if they (states) cannot pay the subsidy for free electricity from their budget then they should not promise such freebies. He pointed out, "many states are finding it different to pay subsidies (given as free electricity). Many states don't even have an account for these subsidies. Uttar Pradesh is one which doesn't have an account for subsidies, they should be paying. The discoms don't have an account under which they can ask for a subsidy from the state government." About smart metering, the minister informed that the government will come out with an approved list of models and manufacturers for smart meters. In this regard, he said, "this is a big opportunity and there are crores of consumers here. If you have the capability then make it (smart meter) entirely here or you can start with 90 to 95 per cent (smart meter manufacturing) here... I don't want to buy anything from our Northern neighbour (China)." The minister also talked about the inbuilt IT capability of smart meters in view of cyber attacks threat. Union Power Secretary Alok Kumar pointed to the chip shortage problem and said semiconductor chips should be produced more and more in India for faster roll out of the national smart metering programme.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/green-hydrogen-policy-to-be-unveiled-in-next-10-days-r-k-singh/articleshow/89151557.cms||---

This meeting will take place virtually given the COVID spread and that the Vice President of India himself is recovering from a bout of Covid, sources said. The customary meeting will in a way set the tone for the upcoming Budget Session of Parliament where the opposition leaders are expected to corner the government on several key issues. The last couple of sessions have been stormy with the opposition refusing to allow the Houses to function demanding responses from the government on various issues including Pegasus snooping controversy, Central farm laws, inflation and unemployment. The last Winter Session of Parliament was a complete washout in the Upper House with the suspension of 12 opposition MPs for the entire part of the session. While the government through its floor leaders, including the Leader of the House Piyush Goyal, constantly asked the Opposition leaders to apologise to the Chairman for their unruly behaviour in the Monsoon Session which led to the suspension. A united opposition refused to apologise and the members of Parliament throughout the entire Winter Session sat in protest at the Gandhi statue in the Parliament. The Budget Session of Parliament will get underway on January 31 with the joint address of both Houses by President Ram Nath Kovind and on that day the economic survey is also scheduled to be tabled. The Union Budget will be presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on February 1. The first part of the Budget Session will be from January 31 till February 11 and then the second part of the Budget Session will resume again on March 14 till April 8.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-session-rajya-sabha-floor-leaders-to-meet-virtually-on-jan-31/articleshow/89151710.cms||---

A bench headed by Chief Justice N V Ramana directed Rane, son of Union minister Narayan Rane, to surrender before the trial court in the meanwhile and seek regular bail in the matter. The Bombay High Court on January 17 had refused to grant pre-arrest bail to Rane in the case, noting that a balance was needed between conflicting considerations of personal liberty and a proper investigation in the matter. A single-judge bench of the high court had rejected the anticipatory bail applications of Rane and another accused Sandesh Sawant, but had allowed a similar plea of the third accused in the case, Manish Dalvi. The case relates to alleged attack on a Shiv Sena activist in the coastal district.

---||Business||NCLAT asks CoC to consider 63 moons' plea in DHFL Resolution Plan||NEW DELHI: In a major boost to 63 moons technologies, which had filed a petition in the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) against Piramal ascribing Re 1 value to Rs 40,000 crore worth of recoverable assets in the DHFL case, the NCLAT on Thursday ordered the petition to be considered by the Committee of Creditors (CoC). In a statement, 63 moons technologies said with this order, the CoC has to reconsider the provision of section 66 of IBC, which mandates that the benefit should go to all the creditors of DHFL. However, in its resolution plan, the CoC had overlooked this provision to the benefit of the Piramal Group. The 63 moons, which holds non-convertible debentures (NCDs) worth over Rs 200 crore issued by DHFL, had challenged the NCLAT's judgment on the grounds that the current resolution plan was "disappointing" for NCD holders. In September last year, the Supreme Court had directed the NCLAT to complete the hearing of the appeal filed by 63 Moons Technologies against the Piramal Group's resolution plan for mortgage financier Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd (DHFL) within two months. The 63 moons, the only company that challenged the decision of the CoC in NCLAT, stated that if the CoC considers this without alteration of provision of section 66 of IBC, all creditors of DHFL will be benefited. It may be pointed out that in its resolution plan, Piramal had ascribed Re 1 value against Rs 40,000 crore assets that have been fraudulently diverted by erstwhile promoters of DHFL. With 63 moons' efforts, lakhs of creditors will stand to benefit from this Rs 40,000 crore by way of recovery. "The 63 moons has full faith in the Indian judiciary system and believes that truth shall prevail," the company stated.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/nclat-asks-coc-to-consider-63-moons-plea-in-dhfl-resolution-plan/articleshow/89152268.cms||---

The report on the army's website said that it had thwarted several suspected attempts to smuggle drugs into Jordan from Syria, and that large quantities of narcotics were sized in separate interventions that also left several people wounded. The military said that it was “continuing to apply the newly established rules of engagement and will strike with an iron fist and deal with force and firmness with any infiltration or smuggling attempts to protect the borders.” Earlier this month the military said an army officer was killed in a shootout with smugglers along the long porous border it shares with Syria. Jordan is home to more than 650,000 Syrian refugees who fled the civil war that has raged there for more than a decade. In September, Syrian and Jordanian officials discussed border security after Syrian government forces captured rebel-held areas along the Jordanian frontier. A month later, Jordan's King Abdullah II spoke with Syrian President Bashar Assad for the first time in a decade after the two countries reopened a key border crossing.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/jordanian-military-kills-27-in-shootout-with-syria-smugglers/articleshow/89152474.cms||---
