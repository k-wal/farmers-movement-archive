Biden and his top aides have been reluctant to talk directly about Trump since he took office last January, even as the Republican former president continued to spread lies about his election loss. On Thursday, though, Biden will “lay out the significance of what happened in the Capitol and the singular responsibility President Trump has for the chaos and carnage that we saw and he will forcibly push back on the lies spread by the former president in an attempt to mislead the American people and his own supporters as well as distract from his role in what happened," Psaki said. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, both Democrats, will speak on Thursday morning at the U.S. Capitol, one year after a mob loyal to Trump raided the complex in a failed attempt to stop the counting of Electoral College votes that officially delivered Biden's election victory. Biden has been "clear eyed about the threat the former president represents to our democracy and how the former president constantly works to constantly undermine basic American values and rule of law," Psaki said. She added that the president sees the deadly attacks as a “tragic culmination of what those four years under President Trump did to our country.” Since that day, the “silence and complacency” of many members of the Republican Party, who have backed or failed to refute Trump's election lies "has stuck with him as well,” she said. A spokesman for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Psaki's statements. Four people died on the day of the riot, and one Capitol police officer died the day after defending Congress. Dozens of police were injured during the multi-hour onslaught by Trump supporters, and four officers have since taken their own lives.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-president-biden-to-take-aim-at-trump-for-jan-6-attack-in-anniversary-speech/articleshow/88719696.cms||---

This was the second anti-terror operation against Jaish in south Kashmir within 24 hours, resulting in two local terrorists from the outfit being killed during a gunfight with security forces in Kulgam. IGP Kumar identified the local terrorist killed in Wednesday’s encounter as Mir Owais Amin from Pulwama. The names of the Pakistani duo weren't immediately known. Two M-4 carbines and an AK-series rifle were among the arms, ammunition and other incriminating material recovered from the site of the firefight, he said. Early Wednesday, a joint team of the Army, police and CRPF had launched the cordon-and-search operation in Chandgam, based on intelligence inputs about the presence of terrorists there, said an official. As the security forces neared the suspected terrorist hideout, holed-up terrorists rained bullets on the search party, triggering an encounter in which the Jaish trio was killed, the official added. The police identified the two Jaish terrorists killed in Tuesday’s Kulgam encounter as Amir Wani from Shopian’s Alamgunj and Sameer Khan from Tiken in Pulwama.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jaish-trio-killed-in-pulwama-encounter-arms-recovered/articleshow/88719780.cms||M Saleem Pandit

Fitzgerald has jokingly been described as the "devil’s advocate", having represented controversial figures like Muslim hate preacher Abu Qatada and convicted terrorist Abu Hamza. In a career spanning more than 40 years, Fitzgerald has won many extradition cases. He successfully prevented British Indian Arti Dhir — accused of co-organising the murder in 2017 in Gujarat of her 12-year-old adopted orphan — from being extradited from the UK to India in 2019. He represented alleged D-Company CEO Jabir Motiwala, a Pakistani national, in his battle against extradition from the UK to the US to face drug trafficking charges and, in an extraordinary development, managed to get the US government to withdraw from the case in April 2021. Motiwala flew back to Pakistan a free man. He also represented Amrit Singh, one of three British Sikh men that India was seeking to extradite, accused of being involved in a conspiracy to murder politician Rulda Singh in India in 2009. The three men were discharged. He prevented the extradition of alleged computer hacker Lauri Love to the US in 2018 and successfully got Julian Assange discharged at Westminster magistrates’ court on in January 2021, although the decision has since been overturned. He also won a historic legal battle for the right of Gurkhas — recruited from Nepal to fight in the British army — to settle in Britain. Fitzgerald, joint head of Doughty Street Chambers, graduated with a first in Classics from Oxford University. In Chambers and Partners he is described as "a formidable opponent" whose chief tactic is "getting cases laughed out of court". "He is so tough that he can make the totally unpalatable palatable," the legal ranking firm states. Nirav initially used Clare Montgomery QC, the same barrister as Vijay Mallya, in his extradition hearing, but for his appeal Nirav switched to Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald won permission at the high court last July to appeal against Nirav’s extradition. At Nirav’s appeal hearing on December 14, 2021 he managed to get the proceedings adjourned so that he can get UK experts to examine India's latest assurance. That alone was an achievement and delays the extradition case even further. A directions hearing will take place soon. Choksi, who has acquired Antiguan citizenship by investment, is fighting extradition to India from Antigua, having been granted bail in Dominica on medical grounds and allowed to return to Antigua, from where he claims he was kidnapped. Fitzgerald, who has been representing Choksi for about a year, told TOI: "The Choksi case involves the most disturbing exercise of powers of rendition. It is his case that he was seized in Antigua, beaten, kidnapped and taken to Dominica, with a view to rendition to India for trial there. Who exactly is responsible and in what way will have to be decided at the extradition hearing. If these allegations are shown to be true, then the kidnap of a former Indian citizen from an independent sovereign state, the beating of that citizen, and the attempt to render him to India whilst proceedings were ongoing in Antigua is a matter of the gravest concern for anyone who cares about the rule of law." Whether Fitzgerald, who charges up to £750 (Rs 75,000) per hour, goes in person to Antigua, is Covid-19 dependent, otherwise it will be virtual. There have been some interlocutory proceedings. The next hearing is March 29 and 30, 2022.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nirav-modi-and-mehul-choksi-hire-the-same-formidable-london-barrister-to-fight-their-extradition-battles/articleshow/88719886.cms||NAOMI CANTON
---||Delhi||Weekend curfew will have an adverse impact on hospitality industry: NCR’s restaurateurs||The nightlife and hospitality industry was happy to slowly get back on its feet late last year, and was hoping that 2022 would be the “year of recovery”. However, barely a week into January, 2022 is already proving to be yet “another tough year” for them. From restrictions on seating and night curfew in the last week of December to now the weekend curfew in Delhi, restaurateurs say that there is no way to recover the losses that will be incurred during this time, which otherwise is the peak season for them. “In the last one year or so, 30% of businesses have already shut down in NCR, and we fear that such restrictions and subsequent losses will result in more shutdowns. We started seeing signs of recovery in October-November last year. And we were hoping for good business in December, before restrictions were imposed in the last week of December amid rising number of Omicron cases. We do not understand that when buses, Metro and airlines can operate as usual, then why are restaurants always the first ones to face restrictions. We can work closely with authorities for the safety of patrons and our staff. We urge the authorities to come up with a solution that will help us sustain our businesses,” says restaurateur and president, National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI), Kabir Suri. ‘Weekend curfew can have a deep socio-economic impact on the already beleaguered industry’ After the night curfew was announced in Delhi on December 27, restaurateurs say that they were majorly relying on weekend footfall for business. “Our revenues are totally dependent on dinner hours, and no one wants to plan an evening out when there is a night curfew. Given the time restrictions, we have to take our last order at 9pm, and people hardly start their dinner at 9pm.So, we were relying on weekends as that is when guests plan their outings during lunch hours,” says restaurateur Umang Tiwari, who decided to keep his nightclub in Chanakyapuri closed when the night curfew was announced in Delhi. However, with the Delhi government also announcing the weekend curfew this Tuesday, Tiwari says it will mean “no business” for them. Restaurateur Zorawar Kalra says, “We understand the government’s predicament in regard to the rising number of COVID cases. That being said, the restrictions such as the weekend curfew will have an adverse and deep socio-economic impact on the already beleaguered industry.” 'Gurgaon and Noida restos will face losses, too’Weekend curfew in Delhi means loss of business for Gurgaon and Noida restaurants as well. Restaurateur Varun Puri explains, “There are so many people from areas like Dwarka and south Delhi who drive to Gurgaon on weekends for brunches, etc, but with a weekend curfew in Delhi, that won’t be possible. The same will be the case with Noida outlets. Weekend curfew in Delhi means loss of footfall for Gurgaon and Noida outlets, too, on weekends.” Adds restaurateur Amit Bagga, “After Delhi, Gurgaon and other neighbouring cities might also announce a weekend curfew, as they did earlier. So for us, it will be a major loss across chains in NCR.” ‘We are hoping that food delivery helps businesses stay afloat during this time’With restrictions on the dining experience, restaurants have already started seeing a massive rise in the number of food delivery orders. Restaurateur Zorawar Kalra says, “Food delivery orders will see a surge on weekends, as has always been the case whenever dine-in experience is compromised. We are expecting an exponential increase in deliveries across NCR, and we are hoping that food delivery orders will help businesses stay afloat at this point.” “Food delivery orders will go up, and we will be better prepared than last time (during the lockdown) to handle this number now,” says restaurateur Vikrant Batra.

During the meeting, commanders of both the border guarding forces discussed various border-related issues. The main emphasis was laid on infiltration attempts by Pakistan-based anti-national elements and recovery of arms, ammunition and narcotics on the international border and other issues related to border management,” said BSF DIG, Jammu frontier, S P S Sandhu. “A very strong protest was lodged by BSF regarding all nefarious attempts from across the border by Pakistani elements, especially with regard to arms/ammunition and narcotics consignments seized by BSF in Ramgarh sector on January 3, 2022,” DIG Sandhu added. BSF also strictly objected to drone operations carried out by Pakistan, regularly violating the international border. Other issues like construction work by Pak Rangers close to the international border and intrusion of the same were also discussed. The BSF delegation was led by DIG Surjit Singh and the Pakistani delegation by Brigadier Fahd, sector commander, Sialkot sector. Better communication between the field commanders was also assured by both commanders to maintain peace and harmony at the international border.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bsf-lodges-protest-with-pak-rangers-over-infiltration-bids-drones-smuggling-of-arms/articleshow/88720156.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

At the time of filing the story, 90,793 cases were already reported while the numbers from Tripura and Sikkim were still awaited. At 90,000 cases, Wednesday’s spike as compared to the previous day would be 56.6% (today’s cases are 56.6% higher than 57,973 cases reported yesterday). This is slightly higher than Tuesday’s daily spike of 56.2% as compared to Monday. So far since the beginning of the pandemic, no two consecutive days have reported more than a 50% increase in cases as compared to the fresh cases reported on the previous day. Even in absolute terms, daily cases reported on Wednesday saw an increase of 33,000 as compared to that reported on Tuesday. This is the third-highest single-day increase in cases. These kinds of absolute spikes were previously spotted during the peak of the second wave. On Wednesday Mumbai’s tally was 15,014 which is 56.6% of Maharashtra’s total tally on Wednesday. Similarly, Chennai (2,481) cases reported 51.0% of TN’s total tally on Wednesday. Kolkata’s case count of 6,170 is 44% of West Bengal and Bengaluru Urban’s (3,605 cases) accounted for 84.9% of cases reported from Karnataka.

On December 27, TOI was the first to report that the third or ‘precaution dose’ will comprise the same vaccine which was given as the first and second dose to any particular individual. Covid cases have risen by more than 6.3 times over the past eight days, with Omicron becoming the dominant variant triggering an upsurge in cities, health officials said.

The National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) has also evaluated international data for mixing of vaccines. However, data from some countries have raised concerns about safety as the resultant reactogenicity is high in some people after receiving booster dose of a vaccine different from the first two doses.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/covid-booster-to-be-of-same-vaccine-as-previous-2-shots-says-government/articleshow/88721030.cms||Sushmi Dey

In Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital, the Delhi government’s biggest pandemic hospital, there were 10 Covid patients in November-end. It has reached 70 now. The government has asked all hospitals and nursing homes having over 50 beds to reserve 40% of them for Covid cases, as was done during the second wave. In Mumbai, 834 hospitalisations were recorded on Tuesday, up from 574 on Monday and 503 on Sunday. Compared to average daily hospitalisations seen about five days ago, the jump is almost 68%.

As per the MHA statement, the PM, who has a high threat perception, was held up on a flyover even as BJP and Congress sparred over the unusual incident with the latter claiming there was a sudden change in Modi’s route and that excuses were being offered to duck a rally with a “thin attendance”. Sources at the Centre alleged what unfolded on the flyover was “a surprising scene of connivance between the Punjab police and so-called protestors” as only the state police was aware of the precise route to be taken by the PM. “Never has such police behaviour been witnessed. This is the single biggest lapse in security of any Indian PM in recent years," said a senior central official who pointed to the risky situation in which the PM was placed for 20 minutes. Read Also'Apne CM ko thanks kehna ... ': PM Modi's dig at chief minister Channi over security lapse in PunjabPrime Minister Narendra Modi, who was stuck on a flyover in Punjab for 20 minutes due to a protest on his route on Wednesday, took a dig at chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi for the "major security lapse." According to news agency ANI, PM Modi on his return to Bhatinda airport told officialsModi’s convoy got stuck on a flyover on the Moga-Ferozepur highway, nearly 20 km before Ferozepur. The MHA sought a detailed report from the Channi government and asked it to "fix responsibility for this lapse and take strict action". Inclement weather in the state ensured that Modi, who landed at Bhisiana air base in Bathinda at 10.25 am on Wednesday, had to abandon the plan to travel by helicopter and instead take the road route to National Martyrs’ Memorial at Ferozepur’s Hussainiwala village on the border with Pakistan.

They"He (the PM) proceeded to travel by road after confirmation of necessary security arrangements by the DGP of Punjab Police," the MHA said. "Around 30 km from the memorial, the Prime Minister’s convoy reached a flyover that was blocked by some protesters," it added.

TheyIn Chandigarh, Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi rejected BJP’s charge of a security lapse during the PM visit to Punjab, adding that he regretted the incident. There was a sudden change in the Prime Minister’s programme, he said. "There was nothing like an attack or security threat to the PM. The PM was not to take the road route. Agitations happen ahead of polls. Even last night, I had asked the officers not to arrest or cane-charge the protesters but convince them somehow. We achieved that last night. Farmers’ agitation went on for a year at the Delhi border. Today if someone held a peaceful protest on the PM's way, it should not be linked to the PM’s security. It is wrong to claim security lapses during his Punjab visit."

Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) leaders said Modi should stay away from the state till all their demands wereThe MHA, in its statement, was categorical that the Punjab government had to make necessary arrangements for logistics, security as well as keep a contingency plan ready. "The Prime Minister’s schedule and travel plans were communicated well in advance to the Punjab government. Also in view of the contingency plan, the Punjab government has to deploy additional security to secure any movement by road, which were clearly not deployed," it added. The CM, on the other hand, was clear that there was no disrespect to the PM. "We regret that the Prime Minister had to return due to a hurdle on his way. Afterall, he is the PM and governments work together. We hold him in high regard. It’s a democratic and federal system. It is our responsibility to respect the PM," Channi said and blamed the change in plans for the problem. "There should be no unnecessary politics on this. We have every respect for our PM. The Punjab government and police are capable enough. It happened because suddenly the plan was changed to go by road and not a chopper. It takes some time to remove peaceful agitators who had suddenly sat on the road. The PM or his team decided to cancel the visit even though he could have reached by chopper or taken an alternative route. We regret that and we are pained. The BJP leaders should avoid playing politics," he said. BJP state committee member Amit Taneja gave a first-hand account of the incident to TOI: "The farmers had gathered at the downstream of flyover on Moga-Ferozepur highway on the Ferozepur side end nearly 20 km before Ferozepur. The BJP workers reached there and tried to clear the road for BJP buses coming for the rally. We did not have an iota of knowledge that the Prime Minister too will come through this road." "Nearly 70-80 protesters were blocking the road, we persuaded them but when they did not listen to us. We asked police to intervene but police too did not do anything to clear the highway. In the melee, there were some clashes between protesters and BJP workers in which 3-4 BJP workers sustained injuries. They were sent to hospital and we again tried to clear the highway," Taneja added. BKU Krantikari Kisan Union protesters denied the claims that they injured BJP workers, broke window panes of BJP buses, or headed towards the PM convoy. "Our workers had blocked the road at Piareana village nearly 20 km ahead of Ferozepur. We wanted to register our protest and did not know that Modi got stuck at the flyover some distance from where our activists were holding a protest," said the outfit’s state president Surjit Singh Phool. Despite the cold and rain, the rally at Ferozepur went ahead and some BJP leaders, including MP Hans Raj Hans and Punjab BJP president Ashwani Sharma, and former chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh addressed the audience. Sharma attacked the Channi government for not providing any security and not clearing the way for the PM’s convoy and also accused it of putting up hurdles in the way of hundreds of buses heading for the rally and harassing people so that they could not reach the venue.

It, however, said that there may not be cold wave conditions over north India during the next five days. Noting that the minimum temperatures were above normal by 2-5 degree celsius over most parts of northwest India (excluding Uttar Pradesh), west Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat and near normal over the rest part of north and adjoining central India during the past 24 hours, the IMD said that "no significa-nt change in minimum temperatures" is likely over most parts of northwest India during next 4-5 days. "Gradual rise in minimum temperatures by 2-4 degree C is very likely over most parts of central India during next 2 days and no significant change thereafter for subsequent three days," it said while ruling out the possibility of cold wave conditions in the regions during next five days. Referring to the western disturbance which is very likely to affect northwest India from Thursday night onwards, the Met department said under its influence, an induced cyclonic circulation is very likely to form over southwest Rajasthan and neighbourhood on Friday. "High moisture feeding from Arabian Sea is also very likely over northwest & central India during Friday-Saturday. Under its influence, isolated heavy rainfall/snowfall is likely over Jammu-Kashmir-Ladakh-Gilgit-Baltistan-Muzaffarabad on Friday-Saturday and over Himachal Pradesh & Uttarakhand on Saturday," it said. The IMD also predicted the possibility of "isolated heavy rainfall over Punjab and Haryana & Chandigarh on Saturday and isolated thunderstorm activity accompanied with hailstorms over Madhya Pradesh on Saturday-Sunday, and over Vidarbha on Sunday".||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/wet-spell-likely-in-north-central-india-till-jan-9-imd/articleshow/88721309.cms||---
---||India||Molnupiravir has serious safety concerns: ICMR chief||NEW DELHI:Antiviral drug molnupiravir, which recently got approval from the drug regulator and is being launched by several local drug makers, has serious safety concerns, and thus has not been included in the national Covid-19 clinical protocol recommended by the health ministry, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) director general Balram Bhargava said. Bhargava said the Covid-19 task force has debated whether to include the drug in the Covid-19 treatment protocol but decided against it because of concerns. “The US has approved it only based on 1,433 patients with a 3% reduction in moderate disease when given in mild cases. However, we have to remember that this drug has major safety concerns. It can cause teratogenicity, mutagenicity , and it can also cause cartilage damage and can also be damaging to muscles,” Bhargava said. “More importantly, if this drug is given to a man or a woman, contraception has to be used for three months, as the child conceived during that period may have problems with teratogenic influences. So, it is not included in the national clinical protocol, the WHO has not included it, nor has the UK,” he added. Teratogenicity is the ability to cause defects in a developing foetus, whereas mutagenicity refers to permanent transmissible changes in the structure of genetic material of cells. Bhargava further pointed out that there are concerns about children, pregnant and lactating women, those in reproductive age, soft tissue injury, history of infections and vaccinations when this drug is being prescribed. Molnupiravir, originally developed by pharma company Merck, had initially claimed 50% reduction in hospitalisation or death in patients.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/molnupiravir-has-serious-safety-concerns-icmr-chief/articleshow/88721354.cms||Sushmi Dey

EC is also known to be reviewing its Covid guidelines, keeping in mind the evolving situation and the assessment shared with it by the health ministry as well as the state governments concerned. As per sources, the panel shall not pull the plug on physical rallies but may impose stricter curbs, besides also issuing an advisory to the political parties to exercise self-restraint and try to campaign as much as possible through the digital mode and hold smaller rallies. There is also ample indication that roadshows may be banned, since it is not practical to curb the number of participants which keep growing as the roadshow moves. Online filing of nominations will be stressed upon. A source indicated that Covid norms for physical rallies will be dynamic and revised from time to time. While an extra hour of polling will be allowed, the number of voters per polling station has also been cut from the usual 1500 to 1200-1250 to help maintain social distancing. Sources told TOI that the expenditure limit for candidates may be enhanced from the current Rs 22 lakh-Rs 30.8 lakh for upcoming and all future assembly polls. TOI has also learnt that a huge number of paramilitary and state armed police forces may be deployed for polls in UP and and to a less extent in Punjab and Manipur. A source indicated that UP may have around 1 lakh security personnel deployed across all phases, which may stretch to 7-8 phases.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/election-commission-may-allow-rallies-but-with-stricter-restrictions/articleshow/88721451.cms||Bharti Jain

Candidates from "central public sector enterprise, central government, including the armed forces and all India services, state public sector enterprises, or private firm" can apply.The search-cum-selection committee (SCSC) will start shortlisting candidates from January 24. This panel has been empowered to include names of people who don't apply and also relax eligibility criteria to accommodate candidates it feels standout for the position. NSIL's present CMD Radhakrishnan D, who was deputed from Isro, can also apply for the position.NSIL is mandated to commercially exploit the R&D work by Isro centres and units of DoS. Under the administrative control of DoS, the authorised and paid-up capitals of NSIL are Rs 1,000 crore and Rs 710 crore, respectively.According to DoS: "The CMD is the chief executive responsible to board of directors and for all activities and operations, including HR, finance and commercial management, corporate planning and project implementation." Once selected, the appointment will be on deputation or contract basis for five years. The post has been exempted from the ‘Rule of Immediate Absorption' in the case of deputationists.Lt Gen (retd) AK Bhatt, director-general, Indian Space Association (ISpA), told TOI: "NSIL would play a crucial role in the coming years. Whether it (the CMD) is from Isro or the private sector, the important thing would be to steer change with the new policy focused on privatisation. The industry hopes the most suitable person is picked to lead NSIL as we see the CMD's position to be very critical in this step towards privatisation."As per DoS, for candidates from SPSEs or private firms, their company must have an annual turnover of Rs 1,000 crore or more. Preference would be given to candidates from listed companies.DoS has sought applicants who "are graduates with a good academic record from a recognised university or institute, while those with engineering, science backgrounds with an MBA or management or business administration diploma will be preferred"."The government's initiative in attracting professional talent to lead public institutions is commendable and is a right step in public-private partnership in decision-making. We also laud the appointment of Pawan Goenka as chairman of IN-SPACe. We look forward to representation of industry associations like SIA-India on IN-SPACe and other entities where a collaborative approach to policy-making can be encouraged," Anil Prakash, director general, SatCom Industry Association (SIA), said.Applicants from central government and all-India services should be holding a post of joint secretary or equivalent scale of pay, while those from the armed forces should at least be a major general in the army or of equivalent ranks in the IAF and navy. Those from SPSEs and private sector should be working in a post at least at a level immediately below the board level.The applicant, DoS says, should possess adequate technical/operational/project management experience at a senior level. A source from DoS said that aside from the CMD's post, private sector applicants will also be able to apply for other senior positions at NSIL in the future.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/indias-1st-space-psu-chiefs-job-open-to-pvt-sector/articleshow/88721471.cms||---

A third-semester civil engineering student from a college in south Bengaluru, Vishal, 21, was on Monday arrested from his rented accommodation near his college for his alleged involvement in creating and running the Bulli Bai app. Jha has been remanded in police custody till January 10. The Jha family is currently dealing with a medical emergency and was not in a position to give further details but said that as far as they know their son, he is innocent and his Twitter account was hacked. He never interacted with any of us, say suspect’s classmates"We are very ashamed and do not know how to process the happenings. Nobody in three generations from our family has ever stepped near a court," Sudhir Jha lamented. He told TOI that his son was interested in pursuing an MS course abroad and had no idea as to how his son got entangled in ‘such incidents'. The family plans to hire a lawyer once they have dealt with their current medical crisis. Some of Vishal's classmates who TOI spoke to said that they barely knew him as he kept to himself. "We are all in general classes for the first two semesters and begin our specialisation in the third semester. Vishal never interacted with any of us even during the course of the third semester which began in October 2021 and was absent for most of the lectures," the class representative of Vishal's batch stated. His batchmates said that he had no friends and that they didn't know anything about his social life.  College authorities said that they will not initiate any disciplinary action against the student until he is proven guilty by statutory agencies presently probing the case. The faculty said that he was a well-behaved student but had a few backlogs and attendance issues. "We first contacted his parents when his attendance for physical lectures, which began from October 4, was around 60%. We got in touch with them again when the Mumbai police showed up at our department," the head of the civil engineering department said. The college authorities maintained that their institution is not inclined to any political ideologies and treats all students equally. "We do not know what material he must have exposed himself to during the Covid-19 lockdowns. Who knows what was going through his mind during this period," a professor added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/bulli-bai-case-suspects-fatherson-be-truthful-with-police/articleshow/88721478.cms||Sanika Athavale
---||India||CDS crash inquiry: 'Loss of situational awareness' by pilots||NEW DELHI: The pilots' "loss of situational awareness" due to the sudden appearance of a thick cloud cover was the main reason behind the Mi-17 V5 helicopter crash that killed Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat, his wife and 12 others last month. The tri-service inquiry, headed by Air Marshal Manvendra Singh, has ruled out any major structural failure or technical snag in the twin-engine chopper as well as any kind of sabotage or missile attack for the crash near Coonoor in Tamil Nadu on December 8, sources said. The crash was technically described as a case of "controlled flight into terrain" in the report and presentation made to defence minister Rajnath Singh by IAF chief Air Chief Marshal V R Chaudhari and Air Marshal Singh on Wednesday, sources added.  An accident that takes place when the pilot loses situational awareness and unintentionally hits an obstacle - ground, mountain, tree or water body - despite being in full control of his helicopter or aircraft is called CFIT, as was reported by TOI earlier. Both the defence ministry and the IAF did not make a formal statement about the inquiry report, refusing to clarify whether standard operating procedures were flouted or there was an "error of judgment" on the part of pilots. Sources said the Mi-17 V5 chopper was flying at a low altitude when it entered a rolling cloud cover that drastically reduced visibility. In the process of trying to fly out of the cloud cover, the chopper hit a cliff and crashed. The two pilots, Wing Commander Prithvi Singh Chauhan and Squadron Leader Kuldeep Singh, were both in the "master-green" category, signifying their top rating in terms of flying and experience. No distress or other calls were apparently made to the ground stations when the chopper entered the cloud cover. Among other measures to improve VVIP flight protocols and SOPs, the inquiry report has recommended that the crew on such flights should be a mix of master-green and other categories to ensure they seek help from the ground stations if required. The ill-fated Mi-17 V5, which had taken off from Sulur airbase with Gen Rawat, his wife Madhulika, military adviser Brigadier LS Lidder and others, crashed seven minutes before its scheduled landing at the Wellington helipad. The probe also analysed the chopper's black box (flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder) as well as a video filmed by some tourists that showed the Mi-17 V5 disappearing into clouds just before it crashed. TOI had earlier reported that the combination of bad weather and the hilly terrain in the Nilgiri Hills was probably the main reason behind the crash. Flights to the Wellington helipad are undertaken under visual flight rules, which basically means "see and avoid".||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cds-crash-inquiry-loss-of-situational-awareness-by-pilots/articleshow/88721500.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Covid-19: Government & experts from Hyderabad allay Covaxin shelf life fears||HYDERABAD: Allaying fears among certain sections, epidemiologists and health authorities on Wednesday affirmed that the shelf life of indigenous Covid-19 vaccine — Covaxin — is 12 months and the same has been confirmed by all trials conducted so far. The experts said parents have no reason to worry as the Central Drugs Standards Control Organisation (CDSCO) has extended the shelf life of Covaxin to up to 12 months, starting from the date of manufacture, after evaluating safety norms. "We are in a battle and we should not leave a gate open by not vaccinating our children. Parents should trust the system in place and get their children vaccinated," Rakesh Mishra, director, Tata Institute for Genetics and Society, Bangalore, told TOI. Mishra, a former director of Hyderabad-based Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), said Bharat Biotech would have done due diligence before extending the expiry date and that this should not stop people from getting their kids innoculated. "Even if we consider the worst-case scenario, efficacy will be less. At this stage, we should try to keep the number of cases under control so that no new variants are formed and the best way is all eligible people should be vaccinated. Omicron should not be taken lightly and considering it as a natural virus can be dangerous," Mishra added. Mishra said the fact that children are robust and are tolerating the virus better, should not be shown as an excuse to not get them vaccinated. Dr Suneetha Narreddy, consultant, infectious diseases, Apollo Health City, said: "Parents need not worry about the expiry date. CDSCO would have given the extension only after looking through all the safety parameters." Bharat Biotech said after receiving approval from the regulator on the extension of shelf life to 12 months, the company began lifting the unused stock from the private hospitals a few weeks ago at its own expense for relabelling and the exercise is being carried out only after testing and inspection. "All hospitals that have placed new orders have also started receiving fresh stocks," the pharma major added. As the country started vaccinating teenagers on January 3, some parents raised concerns saying that the government was experimenting on children by giving ‘expired' vaccine. Many even took to Twitter to air their concern. "So, my son went to get his first vaccine, the drive for kids begin today and realized that the vaccine had already expired in November. Then a letter was shown wherein it seems the shelf life has been extended!! How, why, on what basis? To clear stock you experiment on kids?" read a tweet from "Navanita Varadpande on her Twitter handle @VpNavanita. Reacting on the issue, Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya said the shelf life of vaccines is extended by the national regulator based on comprehensive analysis and examination of stability study data furnished by the vaccine manufacturers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/govt-experts-allay-covaxin-shelf-life-fears/articleshow/88721514.cms||Nirupa Vatyam
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Resorts around Sariska in trouble over land-use norms||JAIPUR: Hoteliers who invested crores of rupees to construct hotels and resorts outside the Sariska Tiger Reserve (STR) boundary are facing a major crisis after the district administration started an exercise to allegedly revoke the land-use conversion certificates. The hotels and resorts were built nearly five years ago after duly receiving land-use conversion certificates. But now notices have been issued to the nearly 18 hotel/resort owners who had legally got their land-use converted before starting their ventures. The conversions are attempted to be revoked after almost five years for many hotels.The notice of which TOI has a copy says, "The state government through its order dated March 31, 2015 has continuous control over commercial (hotel) and industrial (mining) activities within 1-km area of critical tiger habitat (CTH), Sariska Tiger Project. As per the rules, conversion of agricultural land for non–agriculture purposes is prohibited. To put forth the views, the district collector has asked the hoteliers to submit the reply on Jan 20. Otherwise, the administration will take one-sided action." TOI made several attempts to contact district collector Nannu Mal Pahadia but he remained unavailable for a proper response. On Tuesday, he briefly said over the phone, "I am not aware about the matter and cannot speak offhand. I will have to see the files." Investors claimed they have legally received permission to convert their land and procured no-objection certificates (NOCs) from eight departments concerned, including forest. The district administration's arbitrary move would affect investments already made around Rs 300 crore. A stakeholder, on condition of anonymity, said that a state government order dated May 13, 2016, allowed land conversions near Sariska Tiger Reserve (STR). The conversion continued till February 25, 2020. "All the files were approved during that period by district collectors who were posted in Alwar. Now, the administration is setting a wrong precedent of contesting previous approval given to investors. This will not only discourage the business community, but investors will also lose faith in the state government." A senior forest official at STR too confirmed that land conversion was allowed during this period. "The conversion of land was done by revenue authorities concerned in the areas on the boundary of the STR. The forest department too issued NOCs for the same." Many alleged that the move may affect the tourism prospects of Sariska Tiger Reserve which had recently been showing signs of growth. They also pointed out that hotel owners close to other tiger reserves/sanctuaries in the state have not received such notices. "The land on the boundaries of protected areas have been converted in many districts of the state. However, only Sariska is being targeted and officials are interpreting orders as per their whims and fancies.

---||Lucknow||From ‘Prashna’ Pradesh before 2017, UP is now ‘Uttar’ Pradesh, says CM Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: CM Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday said UP had become a ‘Prashna' (question) Pradesh till 2017 due to poor law and order and safety, but with the efforts of police, the government has made it ‘Uttar' Pradesh by giving befitting reply to criminals and gangsters. The CM said that law and order in the state before 2017 was so abysmal that questions were raised on Uttar Pradesh, but with strict action on criminals, gangsters, and mafia in the last five years, his government has provided answer on how to improve safety and security. In his address after witnessing the passing out parade and inducting 518 women police constable recruits in UP Police at a ceremony held at Reserve Police Lines in Lucknow, Yogi said, "Varsh 2017 ke pehele pradesh ki kaanoon-vyavastha aur mahila suraksha ko lekar desh va duniya mein prashn kiye jaate the (Before 2017, questions were raised in the country and the world on poor law and order and women's safety in the state)." "Kaanoon-vyavastha aur suraksha ke morche par jo pradesh paanch varsh pehle prashn pradesh bana hua tha, aaj woh desh mein kaanoon-vyavastha aur suraksha ke mudde ko lekar uttar pradesh bana hua hai (The state which was questioned five years ago for poor law and order and security now provides answer on tackling the situation by giving befitting reply to criminals and gangsters)," the CM added. All the administrative and police officers worked with team spirit to improve law and order in the state and many policemen were martyred, said Yogi, and paid tributes to the martyr police personnel. The CM lauded the efforts of women cops in the state and said they would contribute to the development of the state. "In March 2017, our government had decided that 20% women would be recruited in police. Till now we have made record recruitment of 1.28 lakh in a fair and transparent manner," he said. The CM also highlighted that the state government has increased the capacity of police training. "Before 2017, only 6,000 recruits could be trained whereas today 15,500 recruits have successfully completed their training, which is a record in the state," he said. In order to provide better law and order in the state, our government established cyber police stations at range level and forensic labs were set up besides strict action on criminals, Yogi said. Uttar Pradesh State Institute of Forensic Sciences is being constructed in Lucknow and police commissionerate system has been implemented in four major cities of the state, he added. Yogi said discipline in the police force is must for good law and order. Since the law and order and security has vastly improved in UP, large scale investment is coming, ensuring employment opportunities for youths and growth of the state. DGP Mukul Goel said the state government has not only improved law and order in the state but has also boosted the morale of cops by making large number of recruitments and giving promotions on time.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/from-prashna-pradesh-before-2017-up-is-now-uttar-pradesh-says-cm/articleshow/88721544.cms||---

For Indian cryptocurrency exchange WazirX new user registrations from tier-2 & 3 cities saw a 1851% growth, compared to 1759% growth among metro cities in 2021, over the previous year. The high percentage number indicates the low base of the users. Its founder Nischal Shetty said crypto trade adoption was higher among females. “The growth in the number of new female users was up by 1009%, as against an 829% growth recorded in an increase in male sign-ups,” Shetty said. Another crypto exchange, CoinDCX saw increased crypto adoption in cities like Indore, Lucknow and Agra, compared to metros. These crypto investors largely consist of a younger audience — 18 to 34 age category — accounting for more than 70% of the total user base. In terms of regional penetration of the currency, users with native language of Gujarati, Marathi, Tamil, Bengali and Telugu seem to be the top five languages, after Hindi. Sumit Gupta, co-founder and CEO at CoinDCX said, “Among the top geographies, northern region was a key driver of the new currency traffic through a mix of tier-1 and tier-2 cities. Among tier-2 cities across regions, Pune, Patna, Jaipur, Indore and Agra fall in the top 15 overall cities, besides Lucknow”. One of the key developments in 2021 was the acceptance of crypto as a store-of-value asset, traditional institutional investors offering crypto services to their clients. “In terms of top crypto portfolios bought by users, legacy and established tokens like BTC and ETH remain in top five choices, followed closely by meme and utility tokens. In December, 2021, we have also seen keen interest in the audience to explore metaverse based crypto tokens,” said Gupta. Exchanges also said there seems to be a growing interest in crypto amongst women which can be attributed to the growing number of new users, almost 75% of which are women.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-user-registrations-for-crypto-grew-faster-in-non-metros-in-2021/articleshow/88719459.cms||Mamtha Asokan

The tribunal has asked the committee of creditors for fresh bids. The appellate tribunal issued the order noting that the transaction was not in compliance with the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). The order was in an appeal last year filed by the Bank of Maharashtra, Sidbi and IFCI that were dissenting creditors. The resolution plan had turned controversial and drew sharp comments from the NCLT as the bid was close to the liquidation value and involved a 95% write-off. The NCLT had approved the order in June 2021 noted that the successful bidder was “paying almost nothing” and hinted that there appeared to be a breach of the confidentiality clause. A banker TOI spoke to said that the Vedanta resolution plan was as good as dead as lenders themselves had sought a rebid. SBI, the largest financial creditor, had in September 2021 approached the appellate tribunal seeking a rebid. SBI, which has around 18% vote share, had cited the observations made in the NCLT order over the hair-cut suffered by various classes of creditors. In July 2021, the NCLAT had stayed the sale of the group companies to Twinstar. The dissenting creditors had objected to the deal pointing out that lenders were getting less than 5% of the admitted claims and even this meagre amount was not being paid upfront but largely in the form of debentures with little cash coming in. Even as the Twinstar bid was stayed by the NCLAT, the corporate affairs ministry had moved in and filed a petition in NCLT to attach the assets of Videocon promoters to increase recovery in the case. In August 2021, the NCLT issued an order to freeze and attach assets and properties of Videocon promoters. The tribunal also directed the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) to disclose information about all assets of the Videocon promoters to freeze and restrain such assets. It also asked banks to provide details of their bank and depository accounts and lockers. Metal magnate Anil Agarwal’s Vedanta group has big plans for the electronics segments — where most of the Indian big names have been wiped out of business. The company had earlier announced plans to set up a flat-screen manufacturing facility in India through Twinstar Display Technologies. More recently, the company has talked about investing in a chip fabrication facility in the country.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/nclat-sets-aside-videocons-sale-to-vedanta-co-twinstar/articleshow/88719573.cms||TNN

---||Vadodara||Coronavirus cases in west zone head northwards||Vadodara: West zone of the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) that has a majority of the posh areas is also contributing the highest when it comes to fresh Covid-19 cases. The trend has been observed since the end of November when a minor rise in cases was witnessed in the city. When the first wave of Covid-19 hit the city, it was the north zone that contributed the highest number of cases. As the third wave catches up, it is the west zone that seems to have taken over. The west zone includes several posh areas and commercial hubs. Areas like Alkapuri, Productivity Road, Jetalpur Road, Racecourse Circle, OP Road, Gotri, Diwalipura, Ellora Park, Laxmipura, Subhanpura, Akota, Gorwa, Vasna Road, Tandalja, Atladara, Sun Pharma Road, Atladara and others fall under the west zone. The area is divided under nine urban health centres (UHC) of the civic body. Cases have been regularly reported from these areas and UHCs. Officials said that the major reason for the high number of cases is travel and high testing. “Residents in these areas travel more. Since the population is better off financially, they even get themselves tested whenever they are unwell,” said VMC medical officer (health) Dr Devesh Patel. An official said that when cases started trickling in in November, almost half were those with travel history. “Most of these cases were from the western parts of the city. Many are asymptomatic and end up testing positive when they get themselves tested for travel abroad or to states with restrictions on entry,” said an official. He too added that travel for work or leisure within or abroad the country was higher in this zone. Sources said that another major factor was higher awareness in the area. “People are not hesitant to get themselves tested. In other areas, there is still reluctance or fear when it comes to testing,” said an official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/coronavirus-cases-in-west-zone-head-northwards/articleshow/88719783.cms||Sachin Sharma

A division bench of justices Pushpa Sathyanarayana and P Velmurugan sought the response while hearing a public interest litigation filed by G Thirumurugan, chief coordinator of the Tamil Nadu Meenavar Urimai Padukappu Iyakkam at Ramanathapuram district. The petitioner stated that the National Oil Spill Disaster Contingency Plan 2015 was drafted in order to establish an effective system of detection, reporting and effective response of oil spills. The plan delineates functions of various departments and agencies for the operational responsibility for marine incidents which could result due to spillage of oil in sea water. As per the plan, all the state governments with coastal areas should constitute a state level oil spill crisis management groups. The plan also mandates to constitute district-level and local oil spill crisis management groups. He stated that oil spill incidents would have a deadly effect on the marine species and it would also affect the livelihood of the fishermen. Hence, the petitioner moved the HC Madurai bench seeking to constitute state, district-level and local oil spill crisis management groups in the coastal areas.TNN||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/hc-seeks-response-on-oil-spill-crisis-management-group/articleshow/88720126.cms||---

The petitioner R Mariammal, is a resident of Tirunelveli district. Her husband Ramakrishnan died on January 1, 2019. While he was alive, he took a life insurance policy with a private banking company. After his death, the petitioner approached the insurance company for the assured claim amount. Since the claim amount was not paid, she filed a petition before the permanent lok adalat on December 21. Despite issuing notices on several occasions, the branch manager failed to appear before the lok adalat. Hence, an arrest warrant was issued to him on January 5. On Wednesday, when the process server/ junior bailiff of the district court tried to execute the warrant of arrest, the manager voluntarily obstructed the execution of the same by resisting the arrest. The chairperson and district judge of the Tirunelveli permanent lok adalat, S Sameena directed the Tirunelveli police to arrest the branch manager and produce him before the lok adalat on February 2. The chairperson also forwarded a complaint under Section 195 of Cr P C before the Tirunelveli judicial magistrate court to take action against the branch manager.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/lok-adalat-to-police-arrest-insurance-firm-manager/articleshow/88720131.cms||---

With record funding in the startup ecosystem, more tech IPOs, and more wealth in the hands of techies thanks to increased ESOP buybacks, more younger angel investors backed startups this year. In addition, more seasoned corporate executives and serial entrepreneurs launched their startups this year and sought early-stage funding. Over 25% of angel investors were in the age group of 25-30 years in 2021, compared to a negligible proportion in the previous years, as per an analysis of over 7,000 startups by early-stage investor LetsVenture. Over 50% of the founders who applied to raise funds on the platform were serial entrepreneurs and experienced executives over 30 years of age. In previous years, the startup world in India has largely seen seasoned investors and younger founders dominate the sector. On a YoY basis, LetsVenture’s data shows a 75% jump in new angel investors with no prior experience in angel investing registering on the platform in 2021. US, Singapore, UAE, UK and Qatar were the top nations outside India from where angels registered on LetsVenture. On a YoY basis, there was a 10% growth in investors from the US and 43% growth in investors from Singapore, LetsVenture said. Other angel investors TOI spoke to also note a rise in inquiries and new members on its platform in 2021 as startup investing turned into an appealing asset class for corporate houses, traditional stock market investors, and executives flush with large pay packages. Compared to 2020, LetsVenture witnessed a 23% rise in startups applying to the platform to raise funding and a 30% rise in investors registering to angel invest in 2021. The network also recorded a 120% jump in the number of deals, with over 225 transactions done in calendar year 2021. “With Indian startups crossing $100 bn in funding by Oct, there has been a ripple effect across the ecosystem from the early to growth stage, and the capital surplus has led to younger investors coming into the fold(25-30 yrs old) while the average age of founders has increased to 30+,” Sunitha Ramasway, president, LetsVenture, said. IPOs, exits and the Chinese government’s tightening control on tech also led to a lot of US-based investors turning their attention to the Indian market, she added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/angel-investors-turn-younger-founders-more-seasoned-in-21/articleshow/88719436.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

While a few others, including private equity firms and real estate companies, had shown interest none of them has matched the bid by Brookfield. IL&FS board has put the group’s corporate headquarters on the block as part of the resolution process to address Rs 99,000 crore of debt. Constructed in 2005, the 11-storey building was one of the earliest to come up in the business district. The IL&FS board has been seeking to realise Rs 1,000 crore from the sale of the property. However, sources said that Brookfield’s bid is a bit lower. While the target price is in line with the current value of office premises in the district, the private equity firm has said that the property is nearly 17-year-old and would require additional investment for modernisation and repairs. Also, IL&FS has said that it will continue to occupy a few floors for the time being as a tenant. When contacted, IL&FS declined to comment on the transaction. The Canadian alternate investment company made headlines last year with its $2-billion real estate deal to acquire 1.2 crore sqft of office space from RMZ Corp. The company subsequently raised Rs 3,800 crore through its real estate investment trust. Last year, Yes Bank had acquired the 6.95-lakh sqft erstwhile headquarters of Anil Ambani’s Reliance Group for Rs 1,200 crore. However, no money changed hands as the purchase was adjusted against a loan due from the group company. Earlier, another private equity company Blackstone and Godrej Properties had shown interest in the office property. While IL&FS building is only 11 storey’s subsequent real estate developments in the BKC’s G-Block have many more floors as a relaxation in development norms have allowed higher floor space index for offices using IT. Following the default crisis at IL&FS, the government constituted a new board in October 2018 led by veteran banker Uday Kotak to unwind the liabilities. In September 2021, the government through a notification extended the term of the board until April 2, 2022.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brookfield-leads-race-to-acquire-ilfs-hq/articleshow/88719548.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Business||RBI allows fintechs to access credit bureaus||MUMBAI: The RBI has widened the access to credit information bureaus enabling fintech companies to register as users. In November 2021, the RBI through a gazette notification had amended the Credit Information Companies Regulation 2006. The notification enabled “entities engaged in the processing of information, for the support or benefit of credit institutions and satisfying the criteria laid down by the RBI” to access individual credit histories. The recent notification reverses the central bank’s stand in 2019 that consumer credit information cannot be directly shared with fintech firms. In a communication to banks and NBFCs, the RBI had said that banks were appointing fintech firms as agents but this was against the norms. Under the new regulations, any corporate entity with a net worth of over Rs 2 crore can process information to support regulated lending entities (banks and finance companies). Also, the company has to be Indian-owned with diversified ownership. A key requirement is that the entity should have a certification from CISA (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency) certified auditor that it has a robust and secure information technology system in place. There are currently four credit information bureaus TransUnion Cibil, Equifax, Experian and CRIF Mark. According to lenders, fintechs that do not have a non-banking financial company licence (NBFC) but facilitate credit through partnership with banks will benefit from this move. This would also facilitate e-commerce players to offer ‘buy now pay later’ option in partnership with lenders on their website.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbi-allows-fintechs-to-access-credit-bureaus/articleshow/88719577.cms||---

This comes close on the heels of the Central government curtailing office attendance to 50% of workforce in the wake of the surge in infections. For banks, the protocol will vary according to the district and a decision will be taken by State-Level Bankers’ Committees. Bank of India has said that physical attendance will be restricted to 50% in administrative offices, including head offices in Mumbai, Delhi and Kolkata. In branches, physical attendance shall be restricted to 75% in Mumbai, Delhi and Kolkata. The remaining staff will work from home. The bank has also decided to increase availability of collaborative platforms like Citrix to facilitate WFH. Pregnant women and those with disabilities are also being allowed to work from home in these three cities. Meanwhile, the Indian Institute of Banking and Finance has postponed the exams scheduled on January 8-9. Bankers in Mumbai said that the situation is dynamic and they are awaiting the local administration’s response to the rising numbers to draw up a strategy. In the financial capital, bank staff are dependant on local trains and any move to curtail them would impact operations. The head offices of private banks have continued with a hybrid model even after the ebbing of the second wave. Officials said that work-from-home policy would continue for those in administrative offices, while branches would continue to have attendance.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/banks-restrict-staff-attendance/articleshow/88719566.cms||Mayur Shetty

While currently hospitalisation is low as compared to the second wave that was driven by a more severe Delta variant, officials warned against complacency and said the pandemic is now in a exponential spread phase that could potentially overwhelm healthcare systems. "We are seeing a steep rise in cases. There is an exponential spread. Clearly, this is an expanding pandemic," Niti Aayog member-health Dr V K Paul said. "When cases go up a lot, even a small fraction requiring hospitalisation will be a big number. We have to slow this down. Use masks, observe social distancing. If we don't, there will be pressure on health services. Systems can be overwhelmed. We cannot take this narrative of 'mildness' and become complacent," Paul said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/do-not-fall-for-narrative-of-mildness-government/articleshow/88721551.cms||Sushmi Dey

Counsel representing South Goa Advocates Association Nikhil Pai told the high court that the high positivity rate in the state warrants strict restrictions on entry at Goa’s borders. Pai told the high court that according to the 8th expert committee meeting on August 27 it decided on a graded approach to tourism and it was decided that if the positivity rate is more than 10% and active cases 5,000 and above then “tourism activities to be shut”. The minutes were submitted to the high court. The expert committee had stated that if positivity rate of more than 5% and active cases of 2,500 and above, all schools be closed, border testing be started, functions restricted to 50 in closed halls and 100 in open spaces, no major religious functions/gatherings to be permitted, restaurants to be restricted to 50% capacity with strict Covid appropriate behaviour and business establishments were public gatherings take place to be shut. In the case of a positivity rate of more than 10% and active cases of 5,000 and above, tourism activities to be shut, theatres, gyms, swimming pools and shopping malls to be shut, transport to function at 50% capacity. If a positivity rate of more than 20% and active cases of 10,000 and above the expert committee had decided that maximum restrictions be imposed on entry inside the state, total curfew with only essential services be permitted. Pai said that this graded approach wasn’t being followed Last year, the high court, taking cognisance of PILs at the peak of the second wave, had on May 6 directed that only those possessing Covid-19 negative certificates be permitted entry into Goa from May 10. At the time, the high court had said the state government ought to have imposed these minimum restrictions in public interest on its own, considering the virulent nature of the new strain and how it is spreading and considering the positivity rate was high.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/hc-to-state-submit-report-on-steps-to-tackle-third-wave/articleshow/88743037.cms||Lisa Monteiro

No relief is expected in the coming days as Met department officials have predicted cloudy skies and a few spells of light rainfall between Thursday and Sunday. The dense fog led to a drop in visibility to 50 metres in the morning, which improved to 200 metres by afternoon. As the thick blanket of fog did not allow ground heat to escape into the atmosphere during the night, the minimum temperature increased to 11.6 degrees Celsius, four units above normal. However, the same sheet of fog did not allow sunshine during the day, resulting in a drop in maximum temperature to 18.5 degrees Celsius, 2.4 units below normal. Cold winds added to the chill during the day. State Met director JP Gupta said that a western disturbance over the Himalayas and a cyclonic circulation over Rajasthan will cause generally cloudy sky and a few spells of rainfall across the state from Thursday till Sunday. In Lucknow, apart from light rainfall, moderate to dense fog might also occur, he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/cold-winds-bring-in-chill-factor-fog-blanket-to-stay/articleshow/88720925.cms||TNN
---||Gurgaon||Gurugram: Ex-MP booked as namaz protester files complaint||GURUGRAM: Former Rajya Sabha member Mohammad Adeeb, who recently moved the Supreme Court on namaz disruptions in the city, has been booked under Section 153 (provocation for rioting) of the IPC in an FIR that was based on a complaint from a man who has featured regularly in protests against Friday prayers in public spaces. The complaint itself was based on a newspaper report published on January 2 in a Hindi daily in which a member of the Muslim community purportedly claimed a portion of land in Sector 40 as theirs. Dinesh Bharti, who has been to jail on charges of disrupting namaz and communal harmony, said in his complaint on January 3 that the issue of namaz in open areas was settled after chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar’s statement, but cited the report to allege that Mohammad Abdul Kashmi had claimed they would start building a mosque in Sector 40. Besides Kashmi and one more person, he also named Adeeb in the complaint. Adeeb is the face of Gurugram Muslim Council, a group formed by some Muslim residents of the city in the wake of the namaz row. The three were booked under sections 153 and 34 (common intention) of the IPC at Sector 40 police station on Tuesday. ACP Aman Yadav confirmed the case had been registered. “We have called people (named in the FIR) to record their statement,” he said. Adeeb told TOI he was not even aware of the location of the land in question. “The case was filed without any inquiry or investigation. It was done to dent my reputation and social standing because I filed a contempt case in the Supreme Court. This is a vindictive approach of the administration and police,” he said. Gurugram Muslim Council had had in its petition before the Supreme Court cited the court’s orders on measures to be taken to “curb the communal and violent tendencies that result in perpetration of hate crimes” in the Tehseen S Poonawalla vs Union of India case in 2018 to seek action against the Haryana chief secretary and director general of police. Adeeb added, “We had filed five complaints against this person (Bharti) to police, but till date, no action has been taken on those. But the same police swiftly filed a case on one complaint by this person,” said Adeeb, adding he would move court. The former MP said he had been urging members of the community to approach courts for resolution of issues related to land and other aspects.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/ex-mp-booked-as-namaz-protester-files-complaint/articleshow/88721566.cms||Bagish Jha

---||Gurgaon||New Covid cases cross 1,000 in Gurugram, nearly double in 24 hours||GURUGRAM: The city reported 1,178 new Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, an 85% increase from the 634 cases it reported on Tuesday and a nearly four-fold jump from the 295 new infections that were added on January 1. New cases reported in the first five days of January (2,928) are more than twice that of December’s total count (1,264). Wednesday’s spike is the highest since May 18 last year, during the second wave, when 1,247 people had tested positive. The number of active cases in Gurugram has now reached 3,418. The hospitalisation numbers, though, remain low. Only 19 patients are in institutional care, according to the health department. The rest are in home isolation. One of the hospitalised patients is undergoing bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) treatment, while 11 are on oxygen support. Seven others have so far not needed oxygen support. Only one of the hospitalised patients is less than 30 years old. All the rest are 60-plus. According to the health department, all 19 patients have comorbidities. The Covid hospitalisation rate is 1.6% at present. The daily positivity rate, which was at 5% on January 1, has increased to 12%. The health department plans to increase testing, which has already been stepped up over the past week, to 10,000 a day. On December 30, the city carried out 5,777 tests. On Wednesday, 9,517 tests were conducted. With the number of active cases expected to rise sharply in the coming days, the health department on Wednesday issued fresh guidelines with a shorter home isolation period. According to the revised policy, patients in home isolation will now be ‘discharged’ after seven days have passed since the positive test if they have had no fever for three successive days. The quarantine period was at least 10 days earlier. There is no need for retests after the home isolation period is over. Asymptomatic contacts of infected individuals need not undergo Covid tests and should monitor their health in home quarantine, according to the guidelines. “This time, cases will spread like wildfire. Active cases have already crossed the 3,000 mark. We have changed the home isolation norms. Those who have mild symptoms or are asymptomatic should stay in home isolation for seven days. There is no need to retest themselves once the period of isolation is over and they will be considered negative. We will carry out more than 10,000 tests per day to isolate cases at the earliest,” chief medical officer Virender Yadav said. According to the revised guidelines, immediate medical attention must be sought if serious signs or symptoms of the infection develop, including unresolved high-grade fever (more than 100°F for more than three days), difficulty in breathing, dip in oxygen saturation levels to less than 93%, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, mental confusion or severe fatigue and muscle pain. Doctors said patients are recovering faster this time. “Though we are witnessing a surge in new cases, the recovery time is also shorter compared to the other surges. Most of them don’t have any severe symptoms and are recovering by isolating themselves at home,” said Dr Manoj Goel, director (pulmonology) at Fortis Memorial Research Institute. Haryana reported 2,176 new cases on Wednesday, the most from Gurugram followed by Faridabad (259), Panchkula (171), Sonipat (131) and Ambala (141). At present, the state has 6,036 active cases. It has carried out 44,010 tests in the past 24 hours and the positivity rate is 5.28%. No Covid death was reported in the state on Wednesday. A total of 176 people recovered, of whom 71 were in Gurugram. Haryana has a recovery rate of 97.9%.

District magistrate Suhas LY discouraged non-essential travel and requested only those with a pressing need to step out. The additional curbs, which will come into force from Thursday, were announced as the district recorded more than 1,100 active cases while adding 511 new cases. On Tuesday, the government had issued an advisory to extend night curfew by two hours in all districts from 10 pm to 6 am — on December 24 last year, night curfew was imposed between 11 pm and 5 am across UP. It had also announced the closure of all schools up to class 10 till January 16. It said that districts reporting more than 1,000 active cases would have to take additional preventive measures to keep the further spread in check. As per the state government's directive, all gyms and swimming pools will remain shut in the district from Thursday onwards. Restaurants, bars, eateries, multiplexes and cinema halls will be allowed to operate at 50% of their capacity. A cap of 100 guests has also been imposed on weddings and other social gatherings in closed banquet halls. Gatherings on open grounds will also be limited to 50% occupancy. A decision on food delivery during the curfew timings, the DM said, will be announced by Thursday noon after consultation with senior officials in Lucknow. “I want to clarify that no economic activity will be curbed or stopped and no passes will be required. However, police personnel will remain deployed to keep the unnecessary movement of people under check at night. Private companies and establishments will be requested to call minimum staff to office. In case executives are called for night shifts, they will be allowed to commute between work and home on the basis of their official identity cards,” he said. Assuaging fears, Suhas said, the need for hospitalisation among patients in the district was still low and there was no need to panic. “Though cases are going up, the condition of most patients is stable. Only 16 individuals are in hospitals of the more than 1,100 patients in the district. Nobody has sought our help for oxygen cylinder or finding a bed so far,” he said. Monitoring cells have also been activated to provide immediate support to any person in need, he said, adding the Integrated Covid Command Centre (ICCC) can be contacted on 18004192211 and anyone in need can get details about vaccination, hospitalisation or even telephonic consultation with doctors. Meanwhile, the health department said it 89% of the eligible population has been vaccinated with both the doses and the remaining 11% will be covered by January 15. In the 15+ category, 1.15 lakh children will be administered the first dose by January 20. All schools shut till Jan 16With Uttar Pradesh recording 2,038 fresh Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, the government reiterated that schools up to class 10 will remain closed from Thursday till January 16. While it will be a holiday for students till class 10, those in classes 11 and 12 will have online classes and can be called to school only for the purpose of vaccination. Clarifying that the closure of schools was not dependent on the graded plan of action that would be put into place as soon as any district reported 1,000 active cases or more, additional chief secretary (information) Navneet Sehgal told TOI that the order applied to all government and public schools irrespective of the number of active cases in any district. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath also emphasized that students of classes 11 and 12 will have to be given two days off for the purpose of getting vaccinated. “Schools will have to give leave to a child on the day he or she get the vaccine and the day after that,” Sehgal said.

---||Noida||UP-Rera revives Noida Sec 62 project stuck for 4 years||NOIDA: Uttar Pradesh Real Estate Regulatory Authority (UP-Rera) exercised powers under section 15 of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, to revive a stalled project in Sector 62, Noida. Allocated in December 2005 for institutional purposes, the site got transferred to a new party after taking the consent of more than two-thirds of the buyers. Rajesh Kumar Tyagi, secretary, UP-Rera, in his order issued on January 4, allowed the transfer of a plot covering 20,000 square metres (five acres) that belonged to Proplarity Infratech Pvt Ltd to Urbanac Building Technologies. Proplarity had offered mixed-use development at the site through its project BizLife. Apart from having retail spaces, offices and commercial components, a certain number of service apartments were supposed to come up at the site. The project, however, has remained stranded for more than four years, with only some construction activity taking place. Meanwhile, stuck buyers approached UP-Rera for relief. Having gone through the proposal submitted by the new entrant, 519 of 750 allottees gave their consent for the takeover in November last year, following which the regulatory authority has allowed transfer rights and liabilities of the project to Urbanac Building Technologies. Paritosh Goel, a partner of the company, said, “We are going to complete the project within four years and deliver it to the buyers. The corroded columns, pillars, plinths will get removed. Also, we are coordinating with Noida Authority for sanction of our building plan and will soon begin work at the site.” The company has tied up with SBTL, another construction group, to speed up the work. Goel said that taking over the project seemed financially feasible as the Noida Authority received most of the land dues in advance. “Only some amount of money in the form of lease rent and time extension charges is pending, but the land premium got settled earlier,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/up-rera-revives-sec-62-project-stuck-for-4-years/articleshow/88721581.cms||---

The count of 15,014 new infections is well above the previous high of 11,206 recorded during the second wave on April 4, 2021. Mumbai’s first-wave high of 2,848 on October 7, 2020 now appears insignificant. Between January 1 and 5, cases have tripled in the city and risen 190% in the state. Despite Covid surge, hosp bed occupancy only 20%The city’s shattering of Covid records on Wednesday drove a 46% jump in daily detections in Maharashtra, which reported 26,538 cases, up from 18,466 on Tuesday. The rise was the highest single-day jump for the state in 223 days or since May 23, when 26,672 cases were reported. Active cases went soaring for the state from 66,306 to 87,505 in 24 hours. TOI had reported on Wednesday that given Tuesday’s case count of 10,606, Mumbai was likely to cross in 24 hours its highest daily caseload seen in the second wave. Mumbai’s active cases crossed 61,923, a whopping 445% rise in just seven days. Maharashtra’s cumulative tally of Covid-19 cases has reached 67,57,032, including Mumbai’s 8,31,979. Daily Covid hospitalisations in the city increased by 46% rise over the previous day and 145% compared to six days ago. Civic numbers showed that 1,218 people had to be hospitalised out of 15,014 detections on Wednesday. Of those hospitalised, 80 needed oxygen support. Till a week ago, daily Covid hospitalisations were below 500. On the brighter side, fatality numbers were in single digits. While Maharashtra reported 8 fatalities, taking its cumulative toll to 1,41,581, Mumbai added 3 deaths, pushing its total mortality numbers to 16,384. Suresh Kakani, AMC, said despite the surge, the city was not inundated with requests for beds. “There has been no sharp rise in demand for beds, oxygen or ICU admissions,” he said, adding bed occupancy is nearing 20%. The city also saw more than 700 discharges. “It is important people wear masks, get tested if they develop symptoms and isolate when they test positive,” he said. He said projections are the wave may start to ebb by the third week of January provided people follow protocols. Health minister Rajesh Tope said a lockdown was not on the cards, but the government could implement augmented restrictions, if needed, to control non-essential activities and prevent crowding. As many as 70 state legislators and over 10 ministers have tested positive and cases are expected to double in three days, though 90% are asymptomatic. In Mumbai, the BMC said 87% of the new cases were asymptomatic. After a review meet on Wednesday, the state decided to allow a 7-day quarantine period for patients followed by a negative RT-PCR test. It has decided to promote home isolation for patients with mild symptoms and permit rapid antigen tests to be used. The tests will be made available at kiosks and pharmacies and the results logged onto the state’s portal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/15014-most-daily-cases-in-city-since-pandemic-began/articleshow/88721583.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Mumbai||Bulli Bai case: Mumbai cops make third arrest, an Uttarakhand student||MUMBAI: The Mumbai cybercrime police on Wednesday made a third arrest in the Bulli Bai app case, picking up a BSc (chemistry) student at Delhi University’s Zakir Hussain College from his house in Kotdwar city of Uttarakhand’s Pauri Garhwal. The father of the 21-year-old, Mayank Rawat, is in the Army and posted in J&K. Earlier, an 18-year-old, a Class 12 passout, was arrested from Uttarakhand and Vishal Kumar Jha (21), a Bihar engineering student, was nabbed in Bengaluru. Police sources claimed that the Bulli Bai Twitter handle was created by Singh and had five followers, including Rawat and Jha (he used two handles). Cops are on the lookout for the creator of the app and the other two followers of Singh’s Twitter handle. Rawat and Singh, who are acquaintances, will soon be brought to Mumbai for interrogation. Police said Rawat had created his Twitter account in 2020 and was communicating with the handle @giyu@007, owned by a Nepali identified as Giyou. Singh’s sister Manisha claimed that she is “innocent and has been framed by a man who she met online”. Collegian deactivated a/c after failing to delete postOn Wednesday, Singh’s sister Manisha claimed: “My sister became close to one Giyu, who is from Nepal, on a social media website. His real name is Himanshu Goyal. He cheated on her and used her credentials to do these ghastly acts on the internet.” The controversy blew up on January 1 when several Muslim women found themselves being “auctioned” on the ‘Bulli Bai’ app hosted by GitHub. The app was also being promoted by a Twitter handle with the name @bullibai and display picture of a Khalistani supporter. A case was lodged by Mumbai Police on the same day. A police source told TOI, “Rawat said that on December 31, 2021, @giyu@007, during a chat, sent him a link of Github platform and asked him to take as many as screenshots of the ‘Bulli Bai’ app and add to his social media timeline so that they can instigate people and attract more follow-ers.” Rawat allegedly sourced photographs and other details of Muslim women from different social media platforms and uploaded them on the app. He used various Twitter handles to circulate the photographs. “On January 1, Rawat took eight screenshots and posted them on his Twitter handle. On January 3, he tried to delete the post, but it was too late, so he deactivated his account,” said the source. Police have seized his mobile and retrieved the screenshots. “Bulli Bai app has been created by some unidentified person who is known to the three arrested,” Mumbai Police commissioner Hemant Nagrale said. “Singh created the ‘Bulli Bai’ Twitter handle on December 31. The trio was arrested after the team gathered information about the five followers and the contents they have posted. The group has even used the tagline on the handle ‘Khalsa Sikh Force’. The group’s motive and who is behind them are unclear. So far, we have not come across any money transactions in the activities of those arrested. They befriended each other through virtual or social media platforms.” Mumbai Police are going through Jha’s six Twitter acc-ounts, two Instagram accou-nts, and his YouTube Channel on which he has posted incendiary speeches on Babri Mas-jid. They are also checking the six Gmail accounts that Jha operated using fake profiles.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/bulli-bai-case-mum-cops-make-third-arrest-a-ukhand-student/articleshow/88721585.cms||Gaurav Talwar
---||Mumbai||No legal right to a public holiday: Bombay HC||MUMBAI: There is no legal right to a public holiday, Bombay high court said on Wednesday, as it declined to direct the administrator of the Union territory of Dadra & Nagar Haveli (D&NH) to declare August 2 a public holiday as it gained liberation/independence from Portuguese rule on that date. “What is your legal right to a public holiday?” asked a bench of justices Gautam Patel and Madhav Jamdar on a petition by Silvassa resident Kishnabhai Ghutia (51) and Aadivasi Navjeevan Jangal Andolan. His petition challenged the October 2021 notification on public holidays for not including August 2, 2022 as the date of “liberation/independence day” of D&NH. Ghutia’s petition said that from August 2, 1954 to August 2, 2020 the day was celebrated as a public holiday for D&NH becoming part of the Indian territory. However there was no justification given for not notifying August 2, 2022 as a public holiday. It questioned if the government can celebrate August 15 and January 26 as public holidays but deprive people of D&NH “to celebrate their Liberation/Independence Day’’ on August 2. Ghutia’s advocate Bhavesh Parmar referred to an April 15, 2019 order where HC directed the D&NH administrator to gazette Good Friday as a public holiday. “If it can be done for Good Friday, then why not for Liberation Day of Dadra & Nagar Haveli?’’ Parmar asked. In their order, the judges said HC’s April 2019 order is on a different footing. “That PIL was for failure to gazette, i.e. make compulsory Good Friday as a public holiday. It was far distant from the present writ petition which seeks declaration of August 2 as public holiday.” They added, “As it is, we have far too many holidays. Perhaps time has come to decrease them... Nobody has a fundamental right to a public holiday.” Parmar pointed out that August 2 as a public holiday was discontinued after 2020. “Whether or not to declare a public holiday or optional holiday is a matter of policy. There is no legally enforceable right to it,” the judges said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/no-legal-right-to-a-public-holiday/articleshow/88721586.cms||Rosy Sequeira

Development of roads plays an important role in the growth of any state,” said Singh, who was in the city with Union minister for road, transport and highways Nitin Gadkari, to lay the foundation stone for 16 national highways worth Rs 7,409 crore in Lucknow. Singh said he also served as the road and transport minister but the kind of work that Nitin Gadkari was doing under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi was amazing. “Around 30-40km road is being constructed daily,” he said. “Law and order is also important for any state to ensure economic development. To remove ‘obstructions’, we need strong people like Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. He knows when to use roadroller, bulldozer or JCB. He has ended goonda raj and mafia raj in the state,” Singh said. He added that work was underway to improve interstate connectivity from Lucknow to nearby cities. Speaking at the programme, Nitin Gadkari said the Lucknow-Kanpur Greenfield Expressway would bring down the travel time between the two cities to just 30 minutes. “The highway will be developed in terms of Mumbai-Pune connectivity. The project will begin in December 2022,” he said. “In the next five years, UP will have seven greenfield expressways and its road infrastructure will be at par with that of USA,” he said. “A 519km long expressway from Gorakhpur will be developed to connect Siliguri via Bihar. The project would cost Rs 32,000 crore and the work will start in next six months. The expressway will pass through backward areas of UP, Bihar and Bengal. The stretch in UP will be of 84km, while it will be 416km in Bihar and 18km in Bengal. Its DPR will be completed in September 2022,” Gadkari added. “Similarly, Chambal Expressway will connect Uttar Pradesh with Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan from Etawah to Kota via Sheopur, Bhind Morena. To be constructed at the cost of Rs 8000 crore, this expressway will connect with the Delhi-Mumbai corridor. A project is in the pipeline to connect Varanasi-Kolkata Greenfield Expressway with Purvanchal Expressway. A 30km elevated road will be laid from Ghazipur to Varanasi-Kolkata Expressway at the cost of Rs 5,000 crore,” he added. The event was attended by CM Yogi Adityanath and deputy CMs Keshav Prasad Maurya and Dinesh Sharma.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/lucknow-kanpur-expressway-will-be-backbone-of-defence-corridor/articleshow/88720939.cms||---

Constant rise in prices of gas, coal and raw materials have seen as many as 100 units shutting down in the last few months. “Around 100 more units are on the verge of closing down by the end of this month due to rise in input cost,” said Mukesh Ughareja, former president of Morbi Ceramic Association. Industry players are blaming overstocking due to rise in product prices and liquidity crunch for closing down of the units. According to the industry association, earlier the gas usage of Morbi units was around 65 lakh standard cubic metres (SCM) per day. Currently, it has come down to 55 lakh SCM due to the closure of units. The ceramic sector, which was already struggling due to high freight and container charges, has been hit hard by increase in gas prices, which have doubled in the last six months. The rise in input cost has also badly affected the export volumes. Since the last three months, the export is down by almost 25%. As the domestic market demand is not high enough, units are facing the problem of overstock. Morbi’s yearly export is worth Rs 13,000 crore which was projected to touch Rs 15,000 crore this year. But if the current situation continues till the end of the year, exports won’t cross Rs 11,000 crore, experts fear. The rise in prices of gas and other raw materials has led to an increase in production cost by as much as 30% which is making it difficult for Morbi manufacturers to compete in the international market. The European countries and China are eating into India’s business, sources said. Nilesh Jetpariya, president of Morbi ceramic industry, said that the rise in input cost is putting strain on ties between manufacturers and buyers. “We are forced to differ from our commitment of supply because we can’t afford the price at which we had booked the order,” Jetpariya said. An industrialist who does not wish to be named said that the government too is at fault. “The government is laying red carpet for the industries from other states in the vibrant Gujarat summit. If they take care of the existing industries we will be able to compete in the international market and also provide employment to the local population.” The industry requires coal for the spray dryer process which is essential for all the units except those making sanitary tiles. “The imported coal is not coming from Indonesia and Gujarat government’s company is providing only 50% of the sanctioned quota of lignite,” Ughareja added.

The state cabinet on Thursday granted approval for the amendments wherein the powers are now vested with the civil judge junior division and district judge to decide on name change applications. It necessitates that applicant’s parents or grandparent’s births must be registered in Goa.  Earlier, the power was vested with either the sub-registrar or the chief registrar for births and deaths. Law minister Nilesh Cabral told TOI that an ordinance will be issued within a day or two to implement the cabinet decision.  The government has received various complaints that non-Goans whose births are registered in Goa are availing the services under the said Act, and changing their surnames to suit their needs akin to the names of Goans. “There is a fear in the mind of the citizens of Goa that the facilities and amenities available to the indigenous Goan population may be availed by the persons from other states by changing their names,” cabinet note said.  The Act lays down the procedure for change of name and surname of any person born in the state of Goa. “The ordinance seeks to make it applicable only to persons of Goan origin whose parents or grandparent had their birth registered in Goa,” the cabinet note said.  In the last couple of years, the state has seen many ‘change in name’ notices in newspapers, mostly by non-Goans.  Such publications raised suspicion of its misuse and the matter was discussed in the assembly in 2019. It was also alleged that names were being changed for the purpose of ancestral property matters or for some other motives.  A delegation from the Gomantak Bhandari Samaj had called on the chief minister Pramod Sawant urging him to amend the Goa Change of Name and Surname Act, 1990, to prevent migrants from acquiring Goan names and receiving benefits earmarked for the backward castes.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/only-goan-origin-people-will-be-able-to-change-name/articleshow/88743146.cms||---

The state-run JJ Hospital confirmed more than 100 infections in the past seven days while more than 300 resident doctors across the city’s medical colleges are currently infected and in isolation.  Byculla’s JJ Hospital has seen an outbreak of Covid-19 cases with 73 resident doctors, 21 faculty members, including the institute’s dean, and scores of staffers from Class III and IV testing positive. Several patients hospitalised for non-Covid ailments too have tested positive. The surge has been so rapid and wide that positive staffers from JJ alone have filled up wards at its affiliated hospitals—St George and GT.  The Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) on Wednesday said that all civic-run medical colleges in the city have seen an explosion of cases in the past few days. Data collated by the body showed that 73 resident doctors were infected in JJ, 45 in BYL Nair, 60 at Parel’s KEM, 80 at LTMG (Sion Hospital) and seven in RN Cooper, Juhu. Eight cases have also been reported from Rajiv Gandhi Medical College in Thane, while government colleges in Dhule, Miraj, Nagpur and Aurangabad have together reported 18 cases. Authorities at JJ Hospital said a separate ward has been created at GT Hospital to accommodate resident doctors. “All positive faculty members are also being hospitalised,” said a senior authority who didn’t want to be named. The official said if the surge in cases continues, they would have to take a decision on halting routine non-Covid procedures. “It’s difficult to tell the source of infection as it could be anyone, but it hasn’t come from a single cluster,” the official said. A senior doctor said several departments, short on staff, have put procedures on hold.  BMC officials said they are watching the JJ situation closely. “We are monitoring the cases. Since there are so many cases in the community, hospitals cannot escape infections altogether,” said Manish Walanju, assistant commissioner of E Ward. While KEM had started seeing a rise in infections from December-end, Sion Hospital saw a rapid jump in the past few days. Dean Dr Mohan Doshi said a few nurses and four faulty members are also infected.  MARD has demanded resident doctors be allowed adequate time to recover and be extended best medical care. “We were already working with two-thirds of the strength. The wave of infections has worsened workload for those who are not infected yet,” said Dr Avinash Dahiphale, president, central MARD. He added resident doctors should be isolated in wards since they live in cramped quarters where the infections could spread fast.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/100-staffers-at-jj-hosp-ve-in-a-wk-300-resident-docs-infected-in-city/articleshow/88721587.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Receipt should be taken after paying the fine. Also, if necessary, a complaint should be lodged on toll free number 1800221916,” said BMC in a statement.Many citizens claim that the marshals are rude and often accuse people of not obeying rules for small things, like the mask momentarily slipping below the nose .||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/call-toll-free-no-for-complaints-against-cleanup-marshals-bmc/articleshow/88721588.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Meeting on Covid curbs today, Maharashtra to get strict about vaccine mandate||MUMBAI: After a review of the spike in Covid cases with the Omicron wave, the state government on Wednesday said it would not impose a lockdown but would implement “augmented restrictions” to control non-essential activities and prevent crowding when required. “There is no need for a 100% lockdown at this stage. We will be implementing augmented restrictions when required. The suggestions will be sent to CM Uddhav Thackeray for his approval,” said state health minister Rajesh Tope after a review meeting chaired by Deputy CM Ajit Pawar. A senior official said a meeting on the restrictions would most likely take place on Thursday. These could include reduction in office attendance and restrictions on timings of shops and restaurants. A restriction on train commuters could also be on the cards. “There is no doubt that restrictions will have to be introduced soon given the speed of transmission,” said a senior official. Tope said cases were expected to double over a 3-day period. As many as 70 legislators and over 10 ministers have tested positive. “The encouraging news is that over 90% patients were asymptomatic and just 1-2% required hospitalisation,” he said. At Wednesday’s meeting, the state decided to reduce the quarantine period to 7 days followed by a negative RT-PCR test. Also, to allow the use of rapid antigen tests to detect the virus instead of the RT-PCR test and to become stricter about vaccinations, especially the second dose. It has also decided to allow private hospitals to undertake booster vaccinations of healthcare workers. “In the current scenario, home isolation is important. Instead of contact tracing, authorities will monitor those who are in home isolation. We have decided to reduce quarantine period to seven days. After this, a negative RT-PCR will be required for patients,” said Tope. He said given the volume of tests anticipated in the coming days, the state had decided to allow rapid antigen tests to detect cases. “Rapid antigen tests will be available at kiosks and pharmacies in the state, and the result will be recorded on our portal. The RT-PCR test will not be needed for detection,” Tope said. With Omicron now the main variant in the state, it was no longer necessaryto test and differentiate between strains, he said. He also said the state would take stricter measures to boost vaccination, especially of the second dose. “There is no doubt symptoms are milder this time, and the analysis was that vaccination is responsible for the change. We will become stricter on enforcing vaccinations,” he said. On booster doses for healthcare workers, Tope said the state would amend rules to allow vaccination at private hospitals as well as they had a stock of vaccines. He denied the state had not used funds sent by Centre for Covid relief. “The Centre sent funds in September for the Emergency Covid Response Programme 2. These have been transferred to the district level, which takes time. There were also some issues placing orders on the GEM portal,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/meeting-on-curbs-today-state-to-get-strict-about-vaccine-mandate/articleshow/88721589.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

---||Mumbai||Collegian deactivated a/c after failing to delete post||Mumbai/Dehradun: The Mumbai cybercrime police, probing the ‘Bulli Bai’ app case, on Wednesday arrested a BSc (chemistry) student at Delhi University’s Zakir Hussain College from his house in Uttarakhand’s Pauri Garhwal. The father of the 21-year-old youth, Mayank Rawat, is in the army and posted in J&K. Earlier, Shweta Singh (18) was arrested from Uttarakhand, and Vishal Kumar Jha (21) was nabbed in Bengaluru.On Wednesday, Singh’s sister Manisha claimed: “My sister became close to one Giyu, who is from Nepal, on a social media website. His real name is Himanshu Goyal. He cheated on her and used her credentials to do these ghastly acts on the internet.” The controversy blew up on January 1 when several Muslim women found themselves being “auctioned” on the ‘Bulli Bai’ app hosted by GitHub. The app was also being promoted by a Twitter handle with the name @bullibai and display picture of a Khalistani supporter. A case was lodged by Mumbai Police on the same day.A police source told TOI, “Rawat said that on December 31, 2021, @giyu@007, during a chat, sent him a link of Github platform and asked him to take as many as screenshots of the ‘Bulli Bai’ app and add to his social media timeline so that they can instigate people and attract more follow-ers.” Rawat allegedly sourced photographs and other details of Muslim women from different social media platforms and uploaded them on the app. He used various Twitter handles to circulate the photographs. “On January 1, Rawat took eight screenshots and posted them on his Twitter handle. On January 3, he tried to delete the post, but it was too late, so he deactivated his account,” said the source. Police have seized his mobile and retrieved the screenshots.“Bulli Bai app has been created by some unidentified person who is known to the three arrested,” Mumbai Police commissioner Hemant Nagrale said. “Singh created the ‘Bulli Bai’ Twitter handle on December 31. The trio was arrested after the team gathered information about the five followers and the contents they have posted. The group has even used the tagline on the handle ‘Khalsa Sikh Force’. The group’s motive and who is behind them are unclear. So far, we have not come across any money transactions in the activities of those arrested. They befriended each other through virtual or social media platforms.”Mumbai Police are going through Jha’s six Twitter acc-ounts, two Instagram accou-nts, and his YouTube Channel on which he has posted incendiary speeches on Babri Mas-jid. They are also checking the six Gmail accounts that Jha operated using fake profiles.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/collegian-deactivated-a/c-after-failing-to-delete-post/articleshow/88721591.cms||Gaurav Talwar

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra colleges shut till February 15, lectures and exams move online||MUMBAI: With rising Covid cases, higher and technical education minister Uday Samant on Wednesday announced that college campuses across the state will be closed and teaching will be completely conducted online till February 15. The decision is applicable to all colleges and universities— public, private and deemed. Students occupying hostels have been asked to return home, except foreigners who have been permitted to stay back and continue their education from hostel rooms. On Tuesday, Samant held a meeting with senior officials of the higher education department and all university vice-chancellors while officers of various district authorities apprised every one of the ground realities. The decision to take teaching online comes two days after the BMC asked schools in Mumbai to close campuses for classes 1-9. Keeping all that in mind, lectures and exams have been shifted to the online mode, the way they were being conducted last year during the previous Covid-19 waves. A government resolution to that effect will be out soon. The state government had ordered colleges to open gates to fully vaccinated students from October 13, 2021. Faculty and staff need to be fully vaccinated and campuses have been asked to call 50% staff on a rotational basis, while the other half works from home. From past experience, it is clear that students face issues while taking exams from home. Samant has ordered that all universities direct colleges to run helplines to address students’ grievances. Colleges must also provide detailed information to students regarding exam syllabi and model question papers. “If students have network issues, or if electricity is lost, if any candidate has health problems or if s/he or someone in the family is Covid-positive, all universities and colleges must be sensitive towards these issues and ensure that the candidate does not lose a year. These rules are applicable to all colleges and universities in the state, private and deemed included,” Samant said. He added there are pockets under universities of Gondia, Jalgaon and Nanded where internet connectivity is particularly poor. “In such cases, the vice-chancellor of each of these universities must discuss the situation on the ground with the disaster control authority and the collectors and in conjunction take a call on how and when offline exams can be conducted.” School students who are due to take intermediate art exam, will be able to do so online. “We have asked the directorate of art to conduct the exam online as school students get grace marks during admission to Class XI. We don’t want them to miss out on that,” added Samant.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/maha-colleges-shut-till-feb-15-lectures-exams-move-online/articleshow/88721593.cms||Hemali Chhapia

Her SLP filed through her lawyer Abha Singh says the HC order “suffers from grave illegalities which renders the order bad in law” and “failed to take into consideration that in matters of social justice and women empowerment, public discourse plays a crucial role in shaping nature of legal entitlements that are delivered to women.” — Swati Deshpande||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/woman-files-slp-against-hc-gag-order-in-posh-case/articleshow/88721594.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 134 charging points coming up soon in city as state pushes EVs||MUMBAI: The state has launched a massive project to increase EV charging stations in Mumbai from this month. The government has set a target of 1,500 EV stations in a couple of years, with the first lot of 134 coming up soon in the city. It has invited expression of interest for a 12-year lease to set up EV charging stations in Mumbai. “We will team up with private parties to strengthen the EV infrastructure. Power will be available at a concessional rate of Rs 5.5 per unit,” a senior government official said. The electricity rate will be less than that by around a rupee per unit during late-night hours. “There is a minimum requirement of 100 sq meters of land on open space to set up a charging station,” said Bipin Shrimali, chairman and managing director of Mahatma Phule Renewable Energy and Infrastructure Technology Limited (MAHAPREIT). He said the new EV charging stations could be outside big housing societies having drive-through access to main roads in proximity, cinema complexes, shopping malls, wedding halls, recreational places and restaurants and all such public gathering places where vehicles are parked in sizable numbers. The state’s EV policy 2021 aims at 25% electrification of intra-city public transport and last-mile delivery vehicles by 2025 across MMR, and also pushes for the sale of electric scooters and cars, and therefore there is a need for an adequate number of charging stations, he said. This will be besides charging stations being set up at 27 BEST depots and at all 29 BMC public parking lots in Mumbai.  "Almost 300-350 EV charging stations have been installed in Mumbai and Maharashtra over the past one year through strategic tie ups with vendors. This includes 70 in Mumbai and 30 in Navi Mumbai," said an official from ADDA, which has over 12 years presence in the Apartment Society Management industry.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/134-charging-points-coming-up-soon-in-city-as-state-pushes-evs/articleshow/88721595.cms||Somit Sen
---||Mumbai||‘Antique’ Thai idol: HC asks Customs to end proceedings against bizman||Mumbai: The Bombay high court has put an end to proceedings against a Mumbai businessman by the Customs department after it confiscated a metal idol he had brought from Bangkok in March 2002.While Napean Sea Road resident and OCI Adi Dubash (now 75) claimed he purchased it from the Sunday street market for Rs 1,250, the Customs said it is an antique and valued it at Rs 5 lakh. In 2019, Dubash moved the HC challenging Custom’s orders of July 2014, and September 2018, against confiscation and levy of duty and penalty for not declaring the idol — four headed and eight armed — as an antique article. He said the Fine Arts & Ancient Department, Thailand, had certified that it is not an article of antiquity. But Customs demanded an import license saying the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) had certified it as an antique. In September 2021, HC directed Customs to auction the idol and complete all formalities within 3 months. Customs moved HC saying it cannot conduct the auction. As per the Disposal Manual 2019, issued by the Central Board of Indirect Tax and Customs, all confiscated antiques when they become ‘ripe for disposal’ should be handed over to ASI. It is ASI’s responsibility to dispose of such antiquities by way of gifts to different museums or institutions or by other means. On January 3, a bench of Justices Ramesh Dhanuka and S M Modak were told by its advocate Pradeep Jetley that the idol will be given to ASI, Mumbai, free of cost.In September, Dubash’s advocate Gautam Ankhad told HC that to put an end to the controversy, he is donating the idol to Customs as it is fake. He said Dubash has no objection to the idol’s handover to ASI and will not claim ownership or release of it. The judges the allowed Custom’s plea and directed that it not precipitate proceedings against Dubash or initiate fresh proceedings. “The proceedings ..stand abated,” they concluded.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/antique-thai-idol-hc-asks-customs-to-end-proceedings-against-bizman/articleshow/88721596.cms||Rosy Sequeira

---||Mumbai||RERA tribunal to rehear cases as retired member can’t sign order||MUMBAI: The RERA appellate tribunal recently directed rehearing of two appeals as one of the members retired before the final reasoned judgment could be passed, though an operative part of the order was pronounced on July 26. “In the case where judgment is pronounced in open court but not signed, ...it cannot be signed by the successor in office,” said the tribunal’s judicial member S R Jagtap.  The dispute was between Rivali Park Wintergreen Buyers’ Association, a body of 38 flat owners who had purchased the flats via registered agreements for sale from 2012 to 2017 in Rivali Park project in Borivli, and the landowner, Cable Corporation of India. The buyers wanted the landowner to register itself as the promotor of the project. In August 2020, MahaRERA (Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority) decided that CCI Projects Pvt Ltd (CCIPL) should register Cable Corporation of India Ltd (CCIL) as the project’s promoter since it is the landowner. The developer and the landowner went in appeal and in July the operative order was passed which directed the landowner, CCIL, to be registered as promoter within 30 days of it. The tribunal dealt with a legal issue and held that although the operative part was pronounced in open court based on an unsigned draft by a member, the judgment was neither dictated in an open forum nor finally transcribed that day. Also, the draft part of the judgment dictated by the judicial member was after the pronouncement of the operative part, said the tribunal order by S R Jagtap (judicial member) and S S Sandhu (administrative member) on December 21. In this case, the matter needs to be heard afresh and the tribunal stayed the July operative part, observing that the facts “are rather peculiar”. Once an operative order is passed, reasoned judgment follows and is given to the parties.  The developer CCI Projects Pvt Ltd wanted to challenge the July order, but was handicapped as the full reasoned judgment was not available since Sumant Kolhe, member (judicial), vacated office on August 3, 2021, on retirement. Member (administrative) Sandhu who was on the earlier bench with judicial member Kolhe said though final on August 3 after the day’s work, the judgment could not be signed and uploaded due to “unavoidable circumstances”. Advocate Abir Patel for the developer said since the reasoned order was not dictated when the operative order was passed, the matters must be re-heard in appeal. Advocate Tanuj Lodha for the flat buyers’ association cited the rules to say since the operative order was signed, the reasons already written could still be uploaded. He also cited a rule under the Civil Procedure Code for a successor to pronounce a judgment. The Maha RERA appellate tribunal said in this case, the rule is inapplicable since the record shows till date the “judgments written by the members are not ready in all respects”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/rera-tribunal-to-rehear-cases-as-rtd-member-cant-sign-order/articleshow/88721602.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Goa||Goa: Setback for Mauvin Godinho as HC directs trial in power scam to be expedited||PANAJI: Fifteen years after a special court ordered framing of charges against then power minister Mauvin Godinho and others in the alleged multi-crore power scam, the high court of Bombay at Goa directed the court to exepdite the pending case and conclude the recording of evidence within one year. The order comes as a setback to Godinho ahead of the assembly elections, as he faces charges under the Prevention of Corruption Act . The high court has also directed the special court to submit the progress report of the proceedings of the trial after every three months. In 1998, former chief minister Manohar Parrikar exposed the scam and an FIR was registered in the crime branch of the Goa police against the then power minister in the Congress Government . The special court ordered framing of charges against the accused in 2006. Subsequently in 2007, the high court held that prima facie there is material to frame charges for corruption against the accused. In 2018, the Supreme Court upheld the high court order to proceed with the trial against accused. As the trial did not begin before the special court for the last three years, activist Sudip Tamankar approached the high court and said that trial must be conducted against the accused without delay as per the Supreme Court orders. He said that the accused had entered into criminal conspiracy and caused loss to the tune of Rs 4.5 crore to the state government by giving 25% rebate to industrial units on power consumption. While disposing the petition, justices Sadhana Jadhav and Manish Pitale said, “The learned special judge is directed to expedite the trial as far as possible and conclude the recording of evidence within one year from today, by January 15, 2023.” Tamankar in his petition said that the inordinate delay in commencing the trial against the accused is against the principles of justice and added that "in light of the influence, power and position of the accused persons, there is apparent threat as regards the tampering of the evidence and witnesses, which will go to the root of the matter”. Counsel Dattaprasad Lawande with Pradosh Dangui said that the Supreme Court directed that trials against politicians must be completed in a time bound manner and that there has been a delay of more than a decade since the framing of charges, and delay of almost two years since the last round of litigation, but the trial still hasn't commenced.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/setback-for-mauvin-as-hc-directs-trial-in-power-scam-to-be-expedited/articleshow/88743065.cms||TNN

She always wanted to don ‘Khaki’ uniform and check such incidents from taking place. “This year, my dream of donning the uniform got fulfilled and now I will get to teach such persons a lesson,” a jubilant Prachi said. She, along with 517 other newly-inducted women constables, took part in the passing out parade at Reserve Police Lines, Mahanagar, on Wednesday. They had come to the event along with their parents and siblings. Visibly elated, the women cops said besides getting to contribute in making the society better, they joined the services because of job security, better pay package and timely promotions. ADCP North zone Prachi Singh told TOI that these women constables will now be given the duties of beat incharges, or at pink booths and VVIP and traffic duties from time to time. Anita Rajput, who is daughter of a farmer, said that it was her father’s dream that his children should join the police force. Anita’s elder brother Rajkumar is also a constable in UP police of 2019 batch posted in PAC Aligarh. Kajal Yadav also credited her father, CRPF personnel, for her joining the police force. “My father wanted me to be here. He died five years ago in an accident. He would have been really happy to see me in a uniform,” said Mona Ojha of Gorakhpur.All in the family Vaishali Singh Rathore, 24, and her younger sister Divya Singh Rathore, 22, had been idolizing their elder sister Priyanka Singh Rathore who is also a police constable of 2016 batch. Accompanying them was their younger brother Anupam who also wants to join the police. “We have been observing ‘Didi’ helping elders, homeless adults and illiterate housewives wherever she was posted. Now, we also want to help the society,” said Vaishali and Divya.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/wish-to-change-male-mindset-say-newly-inducted-women-constables/articleshow/88720950.cms||---

Mohit was brought to the hospital two weeks ago with a 1cm-wide metal nut stuck in his right nostril. He had accidentally put the bolt inside his nose. He was having trouble breathing as there was narrow space for air to pass. Also, doctors said that the metal nut was too close to the nasal cavity. “If the nut had slipped into the nasal cavity, it would have endangered the child’s life,” said ENT specialist Dr Himanshu Thakar, who removed the bolt endoscopically. Though the incident occurred two weeks ago, the doctors disclosed the information on Wednesday after keeping Monit under observation. After doctors were sure that the child was completely safe, they disclosed the case details. “If the nut had gone further inside, the patient could have died. Or, during removal if he had started bleeding, it would create more problems,” said Thakar. “Metal nut was 1cm-wide and the chances of complication was very high. However, without any surgery we could remove it endoscopically,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/metal-nut-removed-from-four-year-old-boys-nose/articleshow/88719609.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Stolen ‘gold’ turns out to be imitation jewellery, 4 nabbed||MUMBAI: Four of a gang who allegedly robbed and tried to strangle an elderly woman at her Byculla home on Monday were arrested near Surat in less than 24 hours. Two of the gang had stolen bangles that the woman was wearing at the time. The police said they have recovered these bangles which were imitation jewellery. Around 9am on Monday, two men entered the home of , Mithibai Makwana (78) at Central Railway Compound, by requesting her for a glass of water to drink. As the woman went to get water, the two -- Zakir Shaikh (26) and Raees Shaikh (29) -- entered the house, gagged her and snatched two “gold” bangles she was wearing and fled, leaving her with injuries. A criminal offence was lodged at Byculla police station. The two men and their accomplices -- Manali Bedwewala (31) and her friend Rahul Singh Khandelwal (27) – have been arrested. All four are from Bharuch town in Gujarat. A car belonging to Khanelwal, which was used in the crime, has also been seized, said the police. Senior inspector Ashok Khot formed a team comprising officers Suhas Mane, Rupesh Patil, Dattatray Jadhav, Dnyaneshwar Kharmate and Patole to nab the accused. While scanning CCTV footage of nearby locations, the police noticed the car near the crime spot. This car was used by the suspects to flee from there. “Bedwewala wore a black burqa to avoid being identified. Zakir and Raees had entered the house while Bedwewala tailed them, talking to them on phone and guiding them to the woman’s home,” said an officer. Bedwewala used to stay in the Central railway compound earlier and knew the woman’s residence, said the police. It was Khandelwal who got in touch with Zakir and Raees and convinced them to do the job. The four came by car from Bharuch and reached Mumbai at around 5 am. “They did a recce of the locality thrice before committing the robbery,” said an officer. After the police got the car number, they found Khandelwal’s mobile number and scanned call records. Its location showed that the car was moving towards Gujarat. “We contacted the Gujarat police and sought help. We intercepted the car near the check post. The stolen bangles, which they thought were gold, have been recovered. It was imitation jewellery,” said a police officer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/stolen-gold-turns-out-to-be-imitation-jewellery-4-nabbed/articleshow/88721603.cms||Mateen Hafeez
---||Mumbai||Colour blindness bars FTII study? SC seeks view||Mumbai: The Supreme Court recently set up a committee to see whether the FTII course curriculum provided for the diploma in Editing can be successfully completed by a person who suffers from colour blindness.A student had challenged a Bombay high court order and the SC on November 30, 2021 said, “Colour blindness is not a form of blindness at all, but a deficiency in the way you see colour.”The apex court bench of Justices S K Kaul and MM Sundresh directed the committee to submit a report in three months. The student had applied for the course in 2015 for the three-year post graduate diploma and on his selection was examined by a doctor in July 2016 when he was found to be colour blind (red, blue, green) in both eyes for over 60 percent.“The travails of the appellant began thereafter,” said the SC bench.The FTII cancelled his admission as its rules bar colour blind students. He challenged it and the HC in March 2017, declined to interfere with the cancellation saying, “It would not be appropriate to interfere with the opinion of the expert.” He thus appealed before the SC. Since six years have elapsed, the SC asked the FTII to go through a process of rigors of selection anew but the effect of its order would be to “remove any impediment in the future on account of colour blindness, if the committee so opines”.The SC noted that issue before it was fundamental question whether a person who is colour blind is precluded from pursuing a course for Diploma in Editing at FTII. But the SC said the committee should also opine on aspect of colour blindness for all courses for which it is perceived as a disqualification at present. For FTII, advocate AmitTiwari argued that every endeavour is made by the institute to give encouragement and facilitation to persons with some disability but it is certain courses only which are taken outside the purview of admissions where colour blindness is concerned, as the job itself would be affected. He also contended that the person planning the course is best suitable to determine the impact.The bench said the panel must consist of “a film director, colourist, script supervisor, film editor, ophthalmologist with specialisation in colour blindness and head of department of FTII who is content creator for this course’’ and a lawyer. The court agreed with the suggestion of Colin Gonsalves, senior counsel for the petitioner Ashutosh Kumar tbat the “film director and film editor should be persons who are younger and more contemporary in their dealing and successful in their fields”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/colour-blindness-bars-ftii-study-sc-seeks-view/articleshow/88721604.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Domestic air travel drops as Omicron cases begin to soar||MUMBAI: The Omicron wave has begun hitting domestic air travel. On Tuesday, for the first time in the past two months, daily domestic passenger traffic dropped below 3 lakh. On January 4, only 2.85 lakh passengers boarded flights, according to data shared by the ministry of civil aviation. Tuesdays typically see the leanest traffic and Sundays the heaviest. But in the past eight Tuesdays, passenger traffic was always well over 3 lakh. This Tuesday’s passenger traffic is closer to that of November 2, a Tuesday, when 2.84 lakh passengers boarded flights. The passenger traffic stayed less than 3 lakh till November 5 when 2.73 lakh people flew domestic. But thereafter, for eight straight weeks, every single day, domestic passenger traffic was over 3 lakh. For instance, the previous Tuesday, December 28 registered 3.48 lakh passengers, which was a slight jump from the 3.39 lakh passengers who flew on December 21, the Tuesday before that.  Another indicator comes from Sunday numbers. January 2, a Sunday, was the most popular date for New Year revellers to return home, but the passenger traffic was only 3.58 lakh, a 7 % drop as compared to traffic registered on Dec 28, the previous Sunday. “From Mumbai and Delhi, airlines used to operate about 280 flights per week to Kolkata. The passenger loads are typically high on that route because of transit passengers connecting to north eastern destinations. The recent restrictions imposed by the West Bengal government must have led to the sudden dip in passenger traffic on January 4,” he added. The top three domestic routes out of Delhi, the busiest airport in India are Mumbai, Bengaluru and Kolkata. “In the coming weeks, the rise or dip in domestic air traffic will depend on the Covid cases registered in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Bengal,” he added. “Currently for two week advance booking period, airfares are high and then fall by about 50% on main routes. But in the coming weeks, if traffic continues to fall fares might crash, unless the government intervenes,” he added. A similar pattern was observed last year from March last year with the advent of the Covid second wave. Passenger traffic had begun a downward slide with the month of May seeing the worst decline.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/domestic-air-travel-drops-as-omicron-cases-begin-to-soar/articleshow/88721605.cms||---

---||Mumbai||HC stays order to seal flats; gives time to resolve NBFC-builder dispute over dues||MUMBAI: In a dispute over recovery of money from a developer in a housing project in Mumbai, the Bombay high court on January 3 said it was “aghast’’ to “note that some of the so-called flat purchasers who are themselves builders are moving around in the complex with revolver/s with a view to threaten those who are obstructing their entry in the subject complex”. The HC directed the court receiver to “take forcible possession of all the flats in the complex and seal the same”. The case was filed by Axis Finance for the recovery of over Rs 100 crore from Orbit Ventures Developers and others. Counsels for Axis, Venkatesh Dhond and Rashmin Khandekar, said it had challenged an order of October 28, 2021 passed by a single-judge bench of the HC refusing to grant it relief. On Wednesday, senior counsel Dinyar Madon for the developer said that they would make an attempt to resolve the dispute. An HC bench of Justices S J Kathawalla and Milind Jadhav adjourned the matter by a week to enable such a resolution. On Monday, the HC reproduced a “photograph of one such builder” who claimed to have purchased a flat, carrying a gun. In September 2017, Axis Finance said it had lent Rs 130 crore to Orbit Venture Developer and had received as securities in its favour, 12 unsold flats in a project called ‘Midcity Shikar Tower-1’, receivables from 54 flats to the tune of Rs 107 crore and a mortgage executed by Orbit for a land in Vile Parle (East). The builder defaulted, said Axis, and the account turned into an NPA in December 2019, following which action was filed under the Securitization and Reconstruction of Finance Assets and Enforcement of Security Interests Act, 2002 (SARFAESI Act) and a notice issued in February 2020, effectively restraining the developer from alienating any of the securities. Last January, Axis Finance filed a suit to protect its interests and Justice B P Colabawalla recorded an undertaking from the developer that no third-party interests would be created in respect of nine unsold flats and on February 5, 2021 recorded another undertaking that these nine flats would be handed over physically. Only four were handed over initially. In an earlier order the HC said it was in “complete agreement with the above submission” and said, “We are surprised to note that… the developer submits that certain third parties have forcibly taken possession of some of the flats in the subject project.” To protect the interests of all the parties, it directed a court receiver to seal 34 flats. “It is trite that possession of flats for residential/commercial purpose cannot be handed over to the purchasers without the developers receiving” an occupancy certificate from the civic body, the HC said, adding, “The developers have under the garb of allowing the parties to carry out fitouts in their respective flats handed over the flats to them thereby allowing the flat purchasers to unauthorizedly start residing therein.” Senior counsel Madon for Orbit submitted that the developer has taken all steps to obtain the OC and is expecting it to be granted shortly. "He further states that as the Developers are trying to resolve the dispute between them and the Petitioner, the order passed by this Court on 03.01.2022 to the extent of directing the Court Receiver to take vacant possession of all the flats and seal the same, be put on hold for a period of one week i.e. upto 12.01.2022. Ordered accordingly,'' said the HC in its order on Wednesday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/hc-aghast-at-flat-buyers-showing-guns-directs-custody-over-dues/articleshow/88721609.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Mumbai||Forged docus: Wife of BJP leader to move HC for pre-arrest bail||Mumbai: Two days after a sessions court rejected the anticipatory bail application of Reshma Khairati Khan, the wife of Hyder Azam Khan who is BJP vice-president Maulana Azad Minority Arthik Vikas Maha Mandal Hyder Azam Khan, she plans to move the Bombay high court against the order. Last month, the crime branch had registered an FIR against Khan, IPS officer Deven Bharti and retired police inspector Deepak Phatangare for not initiating action against her despite it being brought to their knowledge in 2017, that she was a Bangladeshi national and had procured an Indian passport based on forged documents.While rejecting Khan’s anticipatory bail plea on Monday, additional sessions judge Deepak Bhagwat had observed that she claims that her parents’ names are Asma Khatun and Mohammed Khairati Hasan, but Khatu-n’s identity card shows that her husband’s name is Gulam Rasul, while Khairati’s ID card does not have Khan as his last name. Also, the court had observed that Khan’s ID card does not mention her name as Reshma Khairati Khan, but Gudiya Khatun. The court had also rejected the defence’s argument that Gudiya was Khan’s nickname saying it is difficult to believe that one would use a nickname on an election ID card. The court had added that the school transfer certificate stated that Khan was in class IX, but in her passport application, she mentioned her educational qualification as “class V or less”. “There are several discrepancies in the documents as furnished on behalf of the applicant,” the judge had said. Additional public prosecutor Seema Deshpande had argued that the documents filed on behalf of the applicant are self-contradictory, and the court agreed and rejected Khan’s anticipatory bail plea. On Wednesday, Khan’s advocate Milan Desai said, “We will move the HC against the sessions court order.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/forged-docus-wife-of-bjp-leader-to-move-hc-for-pre-arrest-bail/articleshow/88721610.cms||---

Deshmukh has sought bail under section 167 (2) of the Criminal Procedure Code which speaks about granting bail after a period of 60 days. The application states that, excluding the first remand, 60 days have elapsed and he is willing to accept bail bond under section 167 of CrPC.The court will hear the argument on January 7. Deshmukh was arrested on November 2, and is currently in jail custody. In its application, ED stated that the concept of statutory bail/default bail cannot be considered once the chargesheet and supplementary chargesheet has been filed. The supplementary prosecution complaint against Deshmukh and 11 others had been filed on December 29, within 60 days of his arrest. — VijayV Singh||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/chargesheet-filed-in-time-no-question-of-bail-to-deshmukh/articleshow/88721611.cms||---

Borivali Government Railway Police (GRP) on Tuesday registered a case of abetment against these individuals. While no arrests have been made, police refused to identify the accused. Ramesh Mohite, 48, had died by suicide on December 20. Police said he lied down on the railway tracks between Kandivali and Malad stations. The Gujarat Mail, heading towards Mumbai Central Terminus, ran over him around 3pm.  The incident was captured on CCTV and the motorman had also seen him get down on the tracks. Initially, an accidental death case was recorded and the body was sent for an autopsy. Police personnel checked Mohite's belongings and found a two-page long suicide note. "He mentioned in the note what drove him to take his life. There appear to be personal as well as financial reasons. He also had issues with the goings-on at the excise department. Mohite mentioned that he was facing mental stress," said an officer. GRP officials said they had summoned the individuals mentioned in the suicide note and have recorded their statements. "We will have to probe to get to the bottom of the case.

While a few others, including private equity firms and real estate companies, had shown interest none of them has matched the bid by Brookfield. IL&FS board has put the group’s corporate headquarters on the block as part of the resolution process to address Rs 99,000 crore of debt. Constructed in 2005, the 11-storey building was one of the earliest to come up in the business district. The IL&FS board has been seeking to realise Rs 1,000 crore from the sale of the property. However, sources said that Brookfield’s bid is a bit lower. While the target price is in line with the current value of office premises in the district, the private equity firm has said that the property is nearly 17-year-old and would require additional investment for modernisation and repairs. Also, IL&FS has said that it will continue to occupy a few floors for the time being as a tenant. When contacted, IL&FS declined to comment on the transaction. The Canadian alternate investment company made headlines last year with its $2-billion real estate deal to acquire 1.2 crore sqft of office space from RMZ Corp. The company subsequently raised Rs 3,800 crore through its real estate investment trust. Last year, Yes Bank had acquired the 6.95-lakh sqft erstwhile headquarters of Anil Ambani’s Reliance Group for Rs 1,200 crore. However, no money changed hands as the purchase was adjusted against a loan due from the group company. Earlier, another private equity company Blackstone and Godrej Properties had shown interest in the office property. While IL&FS building is only 11 storey’s subsequent real estate developments in the BKC’s G-Block have many more floors as a relaxation in norms have allowed higher floor space index for offices using IT.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/brookfield-leads-race-to-acquire-ilfs-hq/articleshow/88721614.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Mumbai||RBI allows fintechs to access credit bureaus||Mumbai: The RBI has widened the access to credit information bureaus enabling fintech companies to register as users.In November 2021, the RBI through a gazette notification had amended the Credit Information Companies Regulation 2006. The notification enabled “entities engaged in the processing of information, for the support or benefit of credit institutions and satisfying the criteria laid down by the RBI” to access individual credit histories.The recent notification reverses the central bank’s stand in 2019 that consumer credit information cannot be directly shared with fintech firms. In a communication to banks and NBFCs, the RBI had said that banks were appointing fintech firms as agents but this was against the norms.Under the new regulations, any corporate entity with a net worth of over Rs 2 crore can process information to support regulated lending entities (banks and finance companies). Also, the company has to be Indian-owned with diversified ownership. A key requirement is that the entity should have a certification from CISA (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency) certified auditor that it has a robust and secure information technology system in place.There are currently four credit information bureaus TransUnion Cibil, Equifax, Experian and CRIF Mark. According to lenders, fintechs that do not have a non-banking financial company licence (NBFC) but facilitate credit through partnership with banks will benefit from this move. This would also facilitate e-commerce players to offer ‘buy now pay later’ option in partnership with lenders on their website.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/rbi-allows-fintechs-to-access-credit-bureaus/articleshow/88721615.cms||---

This comes close on the heels of the Central government curtailing office attendance to 50% of workforce in the wake of the surge in infections. For banks, the protocol will vary according to the district and a decision will be taken by State-Level Bankers’ Committees. Bank of India has said that physical attendance will be restricted to 50% in administrative offices, including head offices in Mumbai, Delhi and Kolkata. In branches, physical attendance shall be restricted to 75% in Mumbai, Delhi and Kolkata. The remaining staff will work from home. The bank has also decided to increase availability of collaborative platforms like Citrix to facilitate WFH. Pregnant women and those with disabilities are also being allowed to work from home in these three cities. Meanwhile, the Indian Institute of Banking and Finance has postponed the exams scheduled on January 8-9. Bankers in Mumbai said that the situation is dynamic and they are awaiting the local administration’s response to the rising numbers to draw up a strategy. In the financial capital, bank staff are dependant on local trains and any move to curtail them would impact operations. The head offices of private banks have continued with a hybrid model even after the ebbing of the second wave. Officials said that work-from-home policy would continue for those in administrative offices, while branches would continue to have attendance.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/banks-restrict-staff-attendance/articleshow/88721616.cms||Mayur Shetty

The tribunal has asked the committee of creditors for fresh bids.The appellate tribunal issued the order noting that the transaction was not in compliance with the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). The order was in an appeal last year filed by the Bank of Maharashtra, Sidbi and IFCI that were dissenting creditors. The resolution plan had turned controversial and drew sharp comments from the NCLT as the bid was close to the liquidation value and involved a 95% write-off. The NCLT had approved the order in June 2021 noted that the successful bidder was “paying almost nothing” and hinted that there appeared to be a breach of the confidentiality clause.A banker TOI spoke to said that the Vedanta resolution plan was as good as dead as lenders themselves had sought a rebid. SBI, the largest financial creditor, had in September 2021 approached the appellate tribunal seeking a rebid. SBI, which has around 18% vote share, had cited the observations made in the NCLT order over the hair-cut suffered by various classes of creditors.In July 2021, the NCLAT had stayed the sale of the group companies to Twinstar. The dissenting creditors had objected to the deal pointing out that lenders were getting less than 5% of the admitted claims and even this meagre amount was not being paid upfront but largely in the form of debentures with little cash coming in.Even as the Twinstar bid was stayed by the NCLAT, the corporate affairs ministry had moved in and filed a petition in NCLT to attach the assets of Videocon promoters to increase recovery in the case. In August 2021, the NCLT issued an order to freeze and attach assets and properties of Videocon promoters. The tribunal also directed the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) to disclose information about all assets of the Videocon promoters to freeze and restrain such assets. It also asked banks to provide details of their bank and depository accounts and lockers.Metal magnate Anil Agarwal’s Vedanta group has big plans for the electronics segments — where most of the Indian big names have been wiped out of business. The company had earlier announced plans to set up a flat-screen manufacturing facility in India through Twinstar Display Technologies. More recently, the company has talked about investing in a chip fabrication facility in the country.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/nclat-sets-aside-videocons-sale-to-vedanta-co-twinstar/articleshow/88721617.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Private hospitals told to take bed count to 2nd wave peak levels||MUMBAI: BMC chief I S Chahal on Wednesday ordered all private hospitals to restore their hospital bed capacity to what it was during the peak of the second wave of Covid -19. He said considering the fact that 10-12% patients are symptomatic every day, the requirement of hospital beds is likely to increase sharply now. “Since more than 95% cases are being detected from non-slum areas, there is tremendous demand for seeking beds in private hospitals only. Patients are reluctant to go to Covid jumbo hospitals and BMC hospitals,” Chahal said in a message sent out on Wednesday morning to all private hospitals and civic officials. Chahal also said it has come to his notice that symptomatic Covid patients have already started complaining of shortage of Covid beds in private hospitals. “Therefore all private hospitals are hereby directed that they shall immediately spruce up the number of Covid beds to the highest level which existed during the peak of the second wave in 2021. All private hospitals shall restore their peak level of Covid beds as early as possible but not later than 10th January 2022,” said the commissioner. BMC staff will start inspecting private hospitals from January 11 onwards to cross-check if the number of Covid beds in each private hospital has been restored to its peak level earlier. Chahal also told TOI the third wave in Mumbai may not last more than 4-5 weeks, going by the experience of South Africa. He said he was referring to a TIFR report which said Mumbai could see a peak between January 6 and 15. Dr Gautam Bhansali, who coordinates between private hospitals and BMC, said all 142 hospitals in the city have been urged to ramp up Covid-19 beds by January 10. This includes 36 major hospitals and 73 nursing homes and mid-level facilities. At present, ss4,000 private beds are activated. “We are trying to start almost 12,000 beds that were there during the 2nd wave. Hospitals have been asked to add beds by January 10,” Bhansali said. Some hospitals said they have started adding beds after receiving calls from the BMC chief on Tuesday. Dr Sujit Chatterjee, CEO of Hiranandani Hospital, said they have added 100 more beds, which increased the count from 244 to 344 and may further push it to 371. “We have reserved the fourth and fifth floors again for Covid patients,” he said, adding the hospital has also equipped itself with its own PSA plant and therefore may not see any oxygen crisis. In a circular, BMC said 80% of total beds and 100% ICU beds shall be kept reserved for Covid-19 patients, as per the rule in the first and second wave. BMC said no asymptomatic patient without comorbidity be alloted beds in private hospitals, and discharge period for asymptomatic patients shall be 3 days, down from 7.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/pvt-hospitals-told-to-take-bed-count-to-2nd-wave-peak-levels/articleshow/88721618.cms||Richa Pinto

According to police, Bharti Parsana (40) and her son Paras (19) were sleeping when her husband went to the farm to water the crop. Three masked men entered their house at about 4am on Wednesday. The robbers entered the house by breaking the main door and thrashed Bharti and her son. They also gagged them before tying them up in their own house. The robbers took the cash, that Bharti’s husband Dinesh had recently got after selling his groundnut crop. They also took the jewellery Bharti was wearing. K K Jadeja, sub-inspector at Lodhika police station said, “We have checked the CCTV footage from the village. The accused appear to be migrant agriculture labourers.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/robbers-thrash-woman-son-flee-with-cash-and-jewellery-in-lodhika-village/articleshow/88719630.cms||---

According to the notice addressed to secretaries and chairpersons of all buildings in K West ward, the BMC has said that the ward has seen a surge in Covid cases in the past few days . “According to data analysis, it is found that most of these cases are being seen in non-slum areas and highrises. Hence, to combat the rise in cases, the K West ward has decided to conduct rampant testing of the majority of population residing in such areas,” said the notice signed by the BMC ward assistant municipal commissioner and medical officer. As per the BMC’s Covid dashboard, K West ward tops the list of 24 wards with the highest active cases at 4,564. The notice also informs the housing society office-bearers about the new BMC guidelines on sealing a building. A building will be sealed if more than 20% residents of occupied flats test positive. If a Covid case is found on a particular floor, then only that floor will be sealed for 14 days. The BMC has also warned that if any person refuses to undergo testing, strict action would be taken. Local Andheri MLA Ameet Satam said that the BMC should not be acting selectively and show urgency in controlling the spread of Covid-19.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/bmc-asks-andheri-highrises-to-ramp-up-testing-amid-surge-in-covid-cases/articleshow/88721619.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Mumbai||In Omicron wave, patients having shorter hospital stay of 3-4 days: BMC||MUMBAI: Doctors are witnessing a shorter duration of hospital stay among Covid patients in the current Omicron wave. Preliminary observations show that even as hundreds are getting hospitalised daily, the majority are getting discharged within three to four days, while those with multiple comorbidities and oxygen requirements are staying longer. “Few have developed Covid pneumonia or required high-level care. We are able to discharge patients in 3-4 days in most cases,” Suresh Kakani, BMC additional municipal commissioner told TOI. He said the biggest departure from the Delta wave so far has been the insignificant need for supplemental oxygen in most hospitalised patients. The city’s cumulative requirement, despite having nearly 5,100 patients in dedicated Covid hospitals and dedicated Covid health centres, has not crossed 25-30MT. A shorter turnaround time has been noted by private hosp-itals too, compared to the previous Delta-driven wave when patients would typically stay for 7-14 days. Though early to comment, the duration of hospitalization is as low as 2-3 days, and oxygen support or ICU requirement is limited to only elderly patients with comorbidities at present, said Dr Abdul Samad Ansari, director of critical care at Nanavati Hospital. Dr Gautam Bhansali said up to 80% of his patients have gone home within three days. “In the Delta wave, the second week used to be crucial as the cytokine storm would set in. So, hospitalisations would stretch till 10-14 days and beyond for more critical patients. We haven’t seen that in many patients yet,” he added. A modelling done by the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research based on data from South Africa and the UK expects deaths to be 30% to 50% of the previous second wave, and hospitalization to be “50-70% of the peak seen under Delta”. Dr S Narayani, zonal director of Fortis Hospitals Mumb-ai, concurred that days of hosp-italization this time around are lesser as compared to earlier, and the mild symptoms have prompted them to encourage early discharges. “Those who are asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic are encouraged to opt for home care,” she said. However, experts cautioned that the stay still depends on multiple factors, including age, stage of the disease, comorbidities of the infected individual and vaccination status. Dr Neelam Andrade, dean of Nesco jumbo Covid hospital in Goregaon, said that the average hospital stay was 10 days in the second wave which has dropped to seven days now. “But in elderly, unvaccinated persons with lung involvement, the duration could be longer,” she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/in-omicron-wave-patients-having-shorter-hosp-stay-of-3-4-days-bmc/articleshow/88721620.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Mumbai||State confirms 144 new Omicron cases, 100 of them from Mumbai||Mumbai: The state on Wednesday confirmed 144 cases of Omicron, the second-highest in a day so far. It has taken the tally of the fast-spreading variant to 797 in Maharashtra. The highest single-day detections were 198 on December 30. Of the 144 cases, Mumbai contributed 100, taking the city’s tally of the infection caused by the variant to 508, including foreign travellers and people from other states who landed in the city and were found positive. With Omicron becoming the dominant strain, health minister Rajesh Tope said it was no longer necessary to differentiate between the variants found in patients. Civic officials in Mumbai have also told hospitals there was no longer a need to segregate suspected or confirmed Omicron patients from Delta as they were suffering from the same disease. The BMC said that of the 100 cases, 77 were with an international travel history. The remaining 22 cases were of people who didn’t have any travel history and are likely to have contracted it from the community. Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer, said that none of the patients had severe disease. Out of 271 international passengers detected with Omicron in Mumbai, 242 have been discharged. Of the 797 total cases, 330 have been discharged already in Maharashtra.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai first in Maharashtra to give 1 crore 1st jabs; teen vax in colleges||MUMBAI: The city on Wednesday became the first district in Maharashtra to administer one crore first doses of Covid-19 vaccine since the launch of the drive last January. Mumbai has administered a total of 1.8 crore vaccine doses so far, covering 108% with a single dose and 88% with both.  While the city has been ahead of most others by leaps and bounds in adult vaccination, it has been lagging in comparison to most big districts in the immunisation of teenagers. On Wednesday, the civic body tried a new approach by starting a camp at Ruparel College in Matunga. A target has been set to vaccinate 2,800 college students between January 5 and January 15. On the first day, 170 students took the shot. It is likely to be started at Dadar’s Kirti College next.  Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said if the on-campus vaccination drive goes on without hiccups, it would be extended to more colleges and schools. Currently, students are brought to the jumbo centres for vaccination. “We want to watch what kind of side-effects are reported and whether it would be safe enough to administer doses outside of a hospital setting,” he said.  While the Centre has set a target of 6.1 lakh to be vaccinated in the 15-17 bracket, the BMC has projected around 9.2 lakh beneficiaries from this age group based on the estimated population of 2021. Since the start of the drive, 15,110 adolescents have taken the first dose. While Mumbai has been clocking an average of 8,000-odd vaccination in this age group, districts such as Thane have been vaccinating over 20,000 by taking the camp to college premises.  The state’s numbers of adolescent vaccination improved further on the third day of the drive. A total of 3,12,605 doses were given to those in the 15-17 age bracket. The adolescent drive has also pushed the daily vaccinations in the state to more than 8 lakh.  Rajesh Tope, public health minister, said the government planned to get stricter about enforcing vaccination, especially the second dose. It has also decided to allow private hospitals to administer booster doses to healthcare workers. Vaccination with booster shots is scheduled to start from January 10.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/city-first-in-maha-to-give-1cr-1st-jabs-teen-vax-in-colleges/articleshow/88721626.cms||Sumitra Debroy

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Despite Covid surge, hospital bed occupancy only 20%||MUMBAI: The city’s shattering of Covid records on Wednesday drove a 46% jump in daily detections in Maharashtra, which reported 26,538 cases, up from 18,466 on Tuesday. The rise was the highest single-day jump for the state in 223 days or since May 23, when 26,672 cases were reported. Active cases went soaring for the state from 66,306 to 87,505 in 24 hours. TOI had reported on Wednesday that given Tuesday’s case count of 10,606, Mumbai was likely to cross in 24 hours its highest daily caseload seen in the second wave. Mumbai’s active cases crossed 61,923, a whopping 445% rise in just seven days. Maharashtra’s cumulative tally of Covid-19 cases has reached 67,57,032, including Mumbai’s 8,31,979. Daily Covid hospitalisations in the city increased by 46% rise over the previous day and 145% compared to six days ago. Civic numbers showed that 1,218 people had to be hospitalised out of 15,014 detections on Wednesday. Of those hospitalised, 80 needed oxygen support. Till a week ago, daily Covid hospitalisations were below 500. On the brighter side, fatality numbers were in single digits. While Maharashtra reported 8 fatalities, taking its cumulative toll to 1,41,581, Mumbai added 3 deaths, pushing its total mortality numbers to 16,384. Suresh Kakani, AMC, said despite the surge, the city was not inundated with requests for beds. “There has been no sharp rise in demand for beds, oxygen or ICU admissions,” he said, adding bed occupancy is nearing 20%. The city also saw more than 700 discharges. “It is important people wear masks, get tested if they develop symptoms and isolate when they test positive,” he said. He said projections are the wave may start to ebb by the third week of January provided people follow protocols. Health minister Rajesh Tope said a lockdown was not on the cards, but the government could implement augmented restrictions, if needed, to control non-essential activities and prevent crowding. As many as 70 state legislators and over 10 ministers have tested positive and cases are expected to double in three days, though 90% are asymptomatic. In Mumbai, the BMC said 87% of the new cases were asymptomatic. After a review meet on Wednesday, the state decided to allow a 7-day quarantine period for patients followed by a negative RT-PCR test. It has decided to promote home isolation for patients with mild symptoms and permit rapid antigen tests to be used. The tests will be made available at kiosks and pharmacies and the results logged onto the state’s portal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/despite-covid-surge-hosp-bed-occupancy-only-20/articleshow/88721630.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Salman was shocked to learn that they were forced to get vaccinated at school. “My first thought was that my children have been administered Covid vaccine, that too without our knowledge. My wife and I were furious. One of my children, who is specially abled, is scared of injections and needs a lot of comforting when he has to get one. We cannot imagine what he might have gone through,” said Salman. While speaking to TOI on Wednesday morning, Salman and his children were still unaware of what vaccine they had received. “Their teacher told them it was for cough and cold. But why weren’t we asked before giving it?” he wondered. Salman’s neighbours, whose children also study in the same school, were equally worried and angry for the same reasons — if their children were given Covid jabs and why didn’t the school take their permission. Later, the parents decided to go to school and demand an explanation. When the group of parents reached the school and asked the headmistress about it, they were told that it was not the Covid vaccine but DPT vaccine — diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough) and tetanus. According to a volunteer at the spot, the headmistress tried to calm the parents down and explained to them that there was no harm with the DPT vaccine. However, the parents were angry over the lack of transparency. DPT immunisations are given as a series of five injections to children starting from two months to six years. “In the present circumstances and with the Covid vaccination drive, parents were worried. The HM explained to them that whenever the children are informed about the vaccine, they skip school. However, she was quick to apologise and said the parents will be kept informed and permission will be taken from them for any such future drives,” the volunteer said. He added that recent reports of expired vaccines and mandatory drives have pushed parents to the edge. Asha workers, who had administered the vaccine, said they had informed the school and it was their responsibility to keep the parents in the loop. Another parent, a businessman, said these activities can prove life-threatening for some children. Explaining that their problem wasn’t the vaccine in itself, but about keeping them being kept in the dark about the drive, he asked: “It is a matter of relief that my daughter is healthy. What if a child is under some medication or already vaccinated? What if it would have led to some unwarranted reaction? I am sure the children weren’t even checked for their health status.” He said in view of the current Covid situation, better transparency is required on the part of schools.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/govt-school-administers-dpt-vax-to-children-keeps-parents-in-dark/articleshow/88721637.cms||Farheen Hussain

Investigators suspect the gold bars were strategically placed by the smuggler as part of a plan for them to be retrieved from the aircraft at a later stage, possibly by another gang member. Sources with KIA said the gold biscuits weighing 2.8kg were found in IndiGo flight 6E 096 (Dubai to Bengaluru). The flight packed with passengers from UAE landed at KIA around 10.30am on Tuesday and all flyers disembarked from the plane. Following a tip-off, sleuths of the Air Intelligence Unit (AIU) of Bangalore Customs combed it thoroughly to spot two bar-like items sealed with a grey duct tape stuck to the bottom of a passenger seat. Officers cut it open to find the 24 gold bars. Investigators are trying to ascertain the identity of the passenger. International smuggling gangs often deploy the modus operandi of placing gold under passenger seats of international flights so that they can be retrieved later when the plane switches from the international leg of the journey to domestic. The gold is estimated to cost around Rs 1.4 crore in the market.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/24-gold-biscuits-worth-1-4cr-found-under-aircraft-seat/articleshow/88721639.cms||Petlee Peter

Road users are complaining of the travel time from Parle Toll Plaza to Yeshwantpur railway station, about 7km, stretching up to 2-3 hours during peak hours.On December 25, officials from National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) temporarily closed the 3km flyover stretching from the toll plaza to Goraguntepalya junction after cables in two pillars (102 and 103) were found damaged. As a result, all vehicles were diverted to the road beneath the flyover, resulting in nightmarish traffic jams.“Initially, we had hoped to finish the work by January first week but now it has extended to January 14. Besides repairing the cable between the two pillars, we will inspect the remaining 119 pillars located between Goraguntepalya and and the toll plaza. However, traffic will be allowed on the flyover once the cables between pillars 102 and 103 are replaced,” Girish SG, project in charge from the contractor’s side, told TOI. The Bengaluru-Nelamangala elevated expressway was opened to the public in December 2010. The first flyover of the expressway, which is currently closed, falls well within the city and carries between 50,000-60,000 vehicles per day (in both directions). The flyover connects the city to 20 districts of north, central and coastal Karnataka. Ramesh Kumar, a resident of Chikkabidarukallu, said it took him almost three hours to travel between the toll plaza junction and Yeshwantpur on Monday morning. “Now, I am leaving early morning to avoid the gridlock. In addition to traffic entering or exiting the city on the Nelamanagala expressway, residents from Dasarahalli, Bagalagunte, Jalahalli, Peenya, Chikka Anaara and other areas use the same road,” he said.Peenya traffic police said around 100 cops are manning traffic between Parle toll plaza junction and Jalahalli Cross from morning to night. “Staff from other traffic police stations in west division have been deployed for this job,” an officer said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/tumakuru-road-flyover-closureups-travel-time-for-commuters/articleshow/88721642.cms||---

Civic authorities had once claimed that TenderSURE roads are likely to last for at least 10 years. NGO Jana Urban Space Foundation had piloted the implementation of TenderSURE roads in Bengaluru. The design envisaged reclaiming pedestrian space, promoting sustainable transport and integrating all utilities like water, power and OFCs underground to prevent repeated digging of the carriageway. Guru Mishra, who lives in the vicinity, said, “Footpath tiles have sunk posing great risk to pedestrians. If anyone trips and falls, s/he is likely to be severely injured.” “Vendors on the street and citizens dump all kinds of mixed waste into the plant beds along the pavements. Regular maintenance of footpaths, plant beds and hanging flower baskets is grossly lacking,” Mishra alleged. Locals also pointed to tiles missing from several places and debris left along the pavements. “It started off with pavements in some places. Now, the road too has sunk in two spots. It can be perilous for those commuting on two-wheelers and motorists,” said Karthik Manay, another resident. M Lokesh, the BBMP chief engineer, said: “There is provision for plants along the pavements, which is where vendors dump biodegradable waste. This draws rodents, which then start burrowing below the pavement leading to the soil becoming loose. And, the pavements start sinking. After identifying this issue, we have decided to use one layer of concrete in all our other projects.” On fixing the damaged pavements Lokesh said, “For some years after the project was completed, BBMP maintained it. That contract has now expired. We have proposed a new contract and are waiting for the same to be approved. People also tend to steal tiles.” V Ravichandar, an urbanist, said, “Many TenderSURE Roads showed visible signs of sinking and other issues in the first two years. Had these issues been addressed at that stage, it would have been resolved by now. TenderSURE roads essentially came with a five-year maintenance period, of which the first few were the defect liability period which means that any issue that crops up in this period has to be rectified by the contractor concerned. When preliminary problems started showing up, BBMP might not have pointed those out to the contractor.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/six-years-on-st-marks-roadpavements-are-crumbling/articleshow/88721644.cms||Mrinalini Bhat

---||Bareilly||Kheri violence: 12 farmers summoned by SIT in ‘lynching’ case||Bareilly: A special investigation team (SIT) summoned 12 farmers on Wednesday in connection with the alleged lynching of three BJP workers during the violence in Lakhimpur Kheri that took place on October 3 last year. Most of these farmers had earlier stated that they were present at the spot but were not involved in the attack. They were at that time charged under bailable sections such as "rioting" and "voluntarily causing hurt" and were let off by SIT officials under Section 41 of the CrPC. Seven farmers have been arrested in the case so far and the SIT is looking for more suspects. A member of the SIT, who did not wish to be named, told TOI, “We have issued summons to record statements of the farmers who were present on the spot and were part of the mob. A few of them appeared before us earlier but none were arrested." Advocate Harjeet Singh, who is representing the farmers, said, “A few farmers were earlier summoned for questioning under lenient sections as they were part of the mob but were not involved in the violence. The farmers who received the summons now are the ones who are witnesses in the case of the murder of farmers. We are waiting for the SIT to find the two other accused in the convoy who managed to escape.” Four farmers and a journalist were allegedly mowed down by Union minister Ajay Mishra Teni's son Ashish Mishra's convoy. Angry farmers had then in retaliation allegedly killed three BJP workers and torched two SUVs that were part of the convoy. Cross FIRs were registered in the case and the SIT submitted a chargesheet on December 3 in which 14 people, including Ashish, who are in jail for the death of the farmers, were named. Seven farmers have been arrested in the lynching case. The investigation in the latter is ongoing. Meanwhile, a copy of the chargesheet filed by the SIT in court against Ashish and 13 others for the deaths of farmers has been given to their counsel Awadesh Kumar Singh. Ashish’s bail plea will be heard by the Lucknow high court on Thursday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/kheri-violence-12-farmers-summoned-by-sit-in-lynching-case/articleshow/88718975.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru’s first double-decker flyover may be ready by June||BENGALURU: After missing October 2021 deadline, Bengaluru’s first double-decker flyover is likely to be ready by this June. Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation (BMRCL) officials said work on the road-cum-rail flyover between Ragigudda and Central Silk Board (3.35km) on Marenahalli Road is progressing. The flyover, where the lower deck will be used by vehicles and the top deck by Metro on one of the busiest stretches in the city, is part of the Metro’s fully elevated RV Road–Bommasandra corridor (18.8km) of the Phase 2 project. “Of the 3.3km road bridge, only around 1km of work is pending. It will be completed by June 2022,” said BMRCL chief public relations officer BL Yashwanth Chavan. An official said: “The most important and complex activity of the double-decker facility is launching and fixing wings to the spine segment of the road-level flyover.” Asked whether the road flyover will be opened before the commencement of Metro operations, Chavan said: “The lower deck has to be connected to the loops and ramps which is under construction at CSB Junction.” He said the deadline for the entire RV Road-Bommasandra Metro corridor is December 2022. Officials said the section between Ragigudda and CSB will be a signal-free corridor. The structure will cater to vehicles and the Metro is expected to decongest the stretch that sees severe traffic snarls during peak hours. Four lanes of the elevated road and four lanes of the surface road will improve the situation. This will be the first time a Metro line is running above a flyover in the city. The elevated road is being built eight metres above the existing road level and the Metro line will be 16 metres above the surface. Similar structures have already been in use in cities like Jaipur, Nagpur and Mumbai. Travelator to link 2 stations Officials said Central Silk Board will get two Metro stations which will be connected by a travelator. “There will be two different stations at CSB. The distance between these two is 355 metres and the plan is to connect the stations by travelator,” said Chavan. Two Metro lines: RVRoad-Bommasandra and Central Silk Board-KR Puram will criss-cross at the CSB junction. The earlier plan was to integrate both stations at the congested junction. Activists said integration is missing in places like Cantonment, MG Road, Yeshwantpur, Kengeri and RV Road, so passengers are finding it difficult to shift from one mode to another.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/blurus-first-double-decker-flyover-may-be-ready-by-june/articleshow/88721649.cms||Christin Mathew Philip
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Property revenue exceeds target in 2021 amid pandemic pressure||BENGALURU: While the cash-strapped Karnataka government struggles to control its fiscal deficit, there may be some relief in terms of better revenue mobilisation. The department of stamps and registration, the third-highest revenue grosser for the state, has already met over 76 per cent of its revenue target for the financial year 2021-2022, which is also indicative of a booming realty sector. The pandemic seems to have made no dent in the revenue as the department’s coffers continue to swell. Ravindra PN, inspector general of registration and commissioner of stamps, said they had racked up Rs 9,784 crore as of December 31, 2021, which is higher than the nine-month (April to December) target of Rs 9,500 crore. “We have achieved around 76 per cent of the Rs 12,665 crore target for the 2021-22 financial year and are confident of surpassing it by March this year,” he added. The department had managed to meet only 85 per cent of the Rs 12,665 crore target in the 2020-2021 financial year,” a senior official said. In the past six months alone, the government has netted Rs 7,000 crore, which is twice the revenue earned during pre-Covid times. The number of property registrations has been on the rise after the government eased Covid curbs in June last year even as sub-registrar offices functioned with limited staff strength. B’luru, Mys contribute 60%Among the districts, Bengaluru and Mysuru accounted for the lion’s share (60%) of the revenue. The government had not revised the 2020-21 target of Rs 12,665 crore since the real estate market was reeling under the impact of the pandemic’s first wave. Senior officials are overwhelmed by the response as revenue remained unaffected despite the government not considering their proposal to reduce the guidance value last year. The government had only reduced stamp duty for the first registration of apartments costing between Rs 20 lakh and Rs 45 lakh to 3% from 5%. Official sources said earning much higher revenue was a possibility since the government has now reduced guidance value by 10% across the state effective from January 1. Prashanth Reddy, chairman, real estate expert committee, Bangalore Chamber of Industry and Commerce (BCIC), said: “It’s certainly a good move, but it would have been better if they had offered the sops for a year instead of three months.” Suresh Hari, chairman, Credai Bengaluru, said the cut in guidance value should be extended till December since real estate may be affected again due to spread of new variants of Covid. CN Govindaraju, chairman and MD, Vaishnavi group, said the change in guidance value is primarily applicable to the available stock of residential and commercial buildings which have already obtained the occupancy certificate. “If the government extends the sops for another nine months, it will motivate other developers to complete projects sooner and obtain OC. This way, it will help the government earn higher revenue in terms of registration fee and stamp duty,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/property-revenue-exceeds-target-in-2021-amid-pandemic-pressure/articleshow/88721650.cms||Manu Aiyappa
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Defying weekend curfew, Congress to launch padayatra on January 9||BENGALURU: While Congress on Wednesday postponed all political rallies and programmes in poll-bound states, including Uttar Pradesh, citing the worsening Covid-19 situation, it decided to go ahead with the padayatra in Karnataka to press for early implementation of the Mekedatu drinking water project. This, despite chief minister Basavaraj Bommai warning of stringent action. “Nobody can stop the sun from shining and water from flowing. Let the government do whatever it wants. We will go ahead with the padayatra by adhering to all Covid guidelines,” KPCC president DK Shivakumar and opposition leader Siddaramaiah said. The Karnataka Congress plans to launch the 160-km, 10-day padayatra from Mekedatu to Bengaluru on January 9. It plans to start from Sangama near Mekedatu, which falls under Shivakumar’s Kanakapura constituency, and culminate in a rally at Bengaluru. Initially, Congress was expected to defer the event after the government enforced weekend curfew for two weeks and banned all political events. Earlier in the day, there were reports the padayatra would be postponed after AICC put off all political programmes in five election-bound states since these events may draw thousands and could emerge as super-spreaders. Shivakumar claimed the new restrictions were imposed only to stop the padayatra. “They have increased the Covid-positive numbers and imposed curbs. This has been done with the sole intention of stopping our march,” he said. Siddaramaiah said the party will ensure all participants wear masks and maintain social distancing. “We have run governments at the Centre and in states. We’re aware of our responsibilities and have no intention to violate curbs,” he said. He accused the state government of trying to stop the padayatra for fear of being exposed. “It's been two and a half years since BJP came to power but no effort has been made to implement the project. None of the 25 BJP MPs ever tried to put pressure on the Centre,” he claimed. Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai warned Congress leaders the government would take suitable action if the latter continued with their padayatra. “The government has imposed curbs considering the rapid spread of Covid cases. If anybody violates them, the law will take its own course,” Bommai said. Health minister K Sudhakar said Congress will be held responsible if Covid cases increase during the padayatra. “Who will take responsibility if Congress workers contract the virus?” he said. RDPR minister KS Eshwarappa urged Congress leaders to postpone the padayatra. “I’m with you in your demand for early implementation of the project,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/defying-weekend-curfew-cong-to-launch-padayatra-on-january-9/articleshow/88721652.cms||---

This comes after the state government announced weekend curfew and other restrictions, and banned political events in the wake of the rise in numbers.Party state president Nalin Kumar Kateel said the baithak has been put off indefinitely owing to the increase in Covid cases and fresh restrictions. “All of us should behave responsibly and adhere to the precautionary measures imposed by the government. We will announce the new dates after the government eases the curbs,” said Kateel.The baithak was planned to evaluate the performance of the government and ministers. It also aimed to orient ministers and members of BJP core committee about the party’s road map for the 2023 assembly polls, ZP-TP elections and BBMP polls likely this year. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/chintan-baithak-put-off-after-fresh-curbs/articleshow/88721654.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||2 develop device to generate real-time Braille impressions||Bengaluru: Inspired by the idea that reading is a joy no one should be deprived of, two youngsters have developed an advanced Braille reader and navigation system. Ruchitha DJ and Rohit Natesh have created a prototype of the system that consists of a box-like device generating real-time Braille impressions. The user needs to click on the link to an article or a book’s PDF and the text is converted into Braille immediately. “The system is developed to have a visually impaired-friendly interface with help of voice instructions and a physical button setup,” Ruchitha said. She told TOI the idea was born during one of their meetings with visually impaired students. “We used to work for an NGO and realised there is so much material online and outside that the visually impaired cannot read or access. Not every book is available in Braille. Though there are technologies that convert texts into audio format, we saw there wasn’t much attention paid to converting data into Braille,” she said, adding that the system can also help new Braille users learn the language.The prototype was part of the duo’s engineering project at MVJ College of Engineering. They spent nearly three years on research. They won the Smart India Hackathon for their work. Ruchitha said they could not keep the device as compact as a mobile but tried to keep it cost-efficient. “It cost us Rs 5,000-6,000 to develop the prototype, which might reduce even further,” she said. However, the two are unsure of how to take their project forward as they have no experience in business or entrepreneurship.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/2-develop-device-to-generate-real-time-braille-impressions/articleshow/88721655.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||HC frowns at abuse of land reforms Act, offers relief to mutt||Bengaluru: A beneficial legislation like the Karnataka Land Reforms Act shouldn’t be allowed to be misused by undeserving persons, the high court has observed. “The Karnataka Land Reforms Act-1961 is undoubtedly a beneficial legislation...It is meant to preserve, protect and also confer benefits on persons who are able to establish the factum of agrarian relationship as tenant in respect of the land, for which form no.7 is filed by them to register them as occupants. Such legislation should not be allowed to be used as a tool for aggrandising undeserving persons by showing them as tenants in respect of the lands,” a division bench of justices PS Dinesh Kumar and P Krishna Bhat stated. Allowing the writ appeal filed by Sri Adamar Mutt, the bench also quashed the December 23, 2003 order passed by the Land Tribunal at Udupi, conferring occupancy rights in respect of seven-and-a-half cents land at Shivalli village in favour of Yashoda, wife of G Anantha Bhatta. On April 24, 2011, a single bench had upheld the order by the Land Tribunal.In the writ appeal, the mutt had claimed that Anantha Bhatta was working there as a cook and the residential premises with appurtenant land in question was given to him only for his occupation and, therefore, the tribunal had no jurisdiction to entertain the application filed in form no. 7. The family of Bhatta claimed they have been cultivating the land.However, the division bench after perusing the records, noted that in an earlier litigation in 1978, Bhatta himself had admitted that he was working as a cook while also claiming that he was a tenant in respect of the land. All the above facts show the property in the subject matter of the order by the Land Tribunal is not a ‘land’, the bench said. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/hc-frowns-at-abuse-of-land-reforms-act-offers-relief-to-mutt/articleshow/88721657.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Can padayatra propel DK Shivakumar to CM’s seat if Congress returns to power?||BENGALURU: Though assembly elections in Karnataka are still 16 months away, a sense of deja vu is already prevailing in Congress. Following in the footsteps of his senior colleague Siddaramaiah, KPCC president DK Shivakumar is all set to undertake a 10-day padayatra from January 9 spanning 160km by covering 15 of the 224 assembly constituencies in the state, despite the government enforcing weekend curfew and banning all political rallies and gatherings. Although the padayatra has been planned to press for implementation of the Mekedatu balancing reservoir project, Shivakumar’s possible game plan is to send out a message that he will be chief minister if Congress returns to power in 2023, thereby nipping Siddaramaiah’s aspiration in the bud. Prof Ravindra Reshme, a political analyst, said padayatras are a proven political instrument and have helped many heavyweights capture power. Andhra Pradesh politicians YS Rajasekhara Reddy, N Chandrababu Naidu and YS Jagan Mohan Reddy had undertaken padayatras before they went on to become CMs. In Karnataka, it was former PM HD Deve Gowda’s padayatra from Vitthalenahalli in Channapatna taluk to Bengaluru during the SM Krishna-led Congress government in 2003 that boosted the fortunes of JD(S). The six-day padayatra was a protest against the police firing resulting in the death of two farmers protesting to get the ban on neera lifted. The following year, JD(S) emerged as the dark horse and kingmaker in the hung assembly. 2012 saw a 416km padayatra (Bellary Chalo) from Bengaluru to Ballari by Congress led by Siddaramaiah against illegal mining. The 14-day padayatra was the longest in the history of the state and it catapulted Congress to power and Siddaramaiah by default was chosen as CM. Citing the example of AP CM Jagan Mohan Reddy, a Congress functionary close to Shivakumar said: “When Jagan embarked on his padayatra, his political image was not at its peak. But it grew multifold after the walkathon, which helped him reach out to the masses. Apart from bringing him closer to people, the padayatra enabled him to touch neutral voters and enlighten them.” Political commentator Vishwas Shetty had a different take. He said padayatra alone cannot bring any leader to power. Citing the example of four-time CM BS Yediyurappa, who has not undertaken a padayatra, Shetty said that a comprehensive victory is directly proportional to the charisma of a leader and the promises made.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/can-padayatra-propel-dks-to-cms-seat-if-congress-returns-to-power/articleshow/88721659.cms||ManuAiyappa Kanathanda

With his son, Vishwajit, who is the state’s health minister, likely to contest from Poriem constituency on BJP ticket, political observers said that the move to bestow the senior Congressman and Goa’s longest serving legislator with the lifetime cabinet status comes with an eye on the Poriem seat, which he has held since 1989. The chief minister also said that, in future too, the lifetime cabinet status will be bestowed on any legislator who completes 50 years in office. “He will always be an inspiration to the people of Goa across strata. I look forward to his continued guidance as we work towards the welfare of the people and development of the state. I congratulate him and wish him all the very best in all his future endeavours,” Sawant said. Reacting to the decision, the health minister thanked the chief minister for having conferred this recognition on his father. “I am grateful to Sawant and the entire cabinet for according the lifetime cabinet status to my father Rane. There is no greater way to honour his 50 years of public service as chief minister, speaker, and MLA. This is a very special gesture,” he said. The Poriem MLA, who is the senior most legislator in the Goa Legislative Assembly, holds the distinction of being chief minister for a record six terms. He has also held the position of speaker between 2007 and 2012, including when the BJP government was at the helm in the state. It was his experience and integrity that had prompted ex-BJP CM Manohar Parrikar to give Rane the speaker’s post in 2000, despite his representing Congress. Rane was first elected on the MGP ticket in 1972 and has since won more than 10 elections. He joined Congress in the late 70s and has remained loyal to the party since then. Last month, Rane and his son, Vishwajit, were at loggerheads over the Poreim constituency. Senior Rane had decided to contest on the Congress ticket whereas his son wanted to contest on the BJP ticket. Later Congress, without wasting any time, announced its candidature for senior Rane. However, a day later the Congress veteran denied that the party had finalised his nomination.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/in-a-first-in-goa-govt-bestows-lifetime-cabinet-status-on-sr-rane/articleshow/88743107.cms||---

Accordingly, the marathon races for girls scheduled at Azamgarh, Varanasi, Ghaziabad and Aligarh have been cancelled. “The move comes after a decision taken by party national general secretary Priyanka Gandhi who said that all big poll rallies have been cancelled till the Covid-19 situation improves.” Prior to this, on December 30, the UP Congress had written to the election commission of India to direct all political parties not to hold big rallies and public events in the wake of the third wave of covid-19 infection. On January 3, Priyanka Gandhi isolated herself after a family member and a close staff tested positive for the coronavirus infection. She also tweeted that she had tested negative but would take the RT-PCR test once again after a few days. Citing the chaos during the Pink Marathon in Bareilly, the opposition accused the Congress of cancelling its event after its failure to hold them successfully. The local administration lodged an FIR against the district Congress chief of Bareilly. But the Congress leaders termed the action as conspiracy and political vendetta.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/cong-cancels-pink-marathons-big-rallies-amid-soaring-cases/articleshow/88720977.cms||Shailvee Sharda

The commission recommended disciplinary and criminal proceedings against the then inspector and sub-inspector of HUDCO police station, near Hosur, who colluded with the victim’s business rivals and harassed him. The sub-inspector even seized victim B Vidayaranya’s luxury car and sold it by threatening him to settle dues. The commission chided police for acting beyond their scope.

Leader of the opposition Edappadi K Palaniswami said the state has been witnessing a series of murders, robberies, theft, and crime against women and children. It shows that the CM had failed to maintain the law and order and it exposed the DMK government’s inefficiency, he said.

In both the clusters, most students were asymptomatic and in stable condition. It is suspected that a majority of students were infected with the Omicron variant of the virus. MIT has quarantined 47 male students at Marutham hostel and six female students at Ponni hostel in the campus. The remaining 14 have opted for home quarantine. The college started testing 169 students on December 30 as a precautionary measure, during which seven students tested positive. Soon, the infected students and their close contacts were isolated. The college tested 1047 students on December 2 and 3. In the results, 60 students tested positive. MIT dean T Thyagarajan said the students who tested positive are quarantined in college hostels, while those who tested negative were allowed to leave . The college started online classes for the students on January 3 for the departments where students tested positive. Health officials and revenue officials visited the campus to review the situation.  Meanwhile, MCC is planning to test all hostel students on Thursday after 12 students tested positive on Wednesday.

In Ward 52 hospital quarters at Mint, 14 cases have been reported while in Seven Wells in ward 55, 13 cases have been reported. Four roads in the city EVR Periyar Salai (RGGGH). Chevaliar Shivaji Ganesan Salai at T Nagar, Shakthi Garden and 200 Feet Road in Thoraipakkam have six to ten cases each.  Noting that unhindered access to different localities and zones could multiply the cases, officials said they are currently focussing on zones where Covid-19 active cases are very high such as Adyar, Teynampet, Kodambakkam, Anna Nagar and Royapuram. “While we are containing the roads with more than ten cases, we are aiming at double vaccination to reduce the spread. The vaccination camps will be focused on slum areas and informal settlements, where hesitancy still remains high,” a corporation official said. Officials said about six lakh people were due for the second dose and they would be setting up camps in those places. Experts say identifying clusters early, having ventilation in place of public gathering, closing down the streets/apartments and covering unvaccinated are strategies to curb the spread. “Even now, in addition to the attenders of patients, a high number of visitors are unnecessarily coming to the hospitals. These people may catch the infection and spread it. Visitors must be banned for now,” said former director of public health Dr K Kolandasamy. The civic body is likely to conduct its next vaccination camp on January 9.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/vax-camps-in-areas-with-high-case-load/articleshow/88721686.cms||---
---||Chennai||Covid rules delay crew change at Chennai port||CHENNAI: Stringent Covid-19 protocols that include mandatory RTPCR negative test results have led to long delays in new crew change on vessels at Chennai Port. While shipping industry representatives insist RTPCR and quarantine procedures were needed only when a person tests positive or shows symptoms, Chennai Port Trust (CPT) officials told TOI that they were merely following the standard operating procedure (SOP) laid down by the Union shipping ministry. Ships change their crew periodically – officers serve for four to six months and sailors nine to 10 months -- before they are replaced with a fresh set of crew. This crew change exercise is getting stuck due to rising Covid-19 cases and the subsequent restrictions in different states in India. Crew change hubs are Chennai, Mumbai and Delhi. A majority of the engineers come from Chennai while sailors come from Delhi. They are not able to board ships because of the tests and restrictions and need for quarantine if tested positive. So, ships are forced to extend the work duration of their crew. Officers are forced to work for nine to 10 months while the number of months gets further increased for sailors. Sanjay Prashar, managing director, VM Maritime said: “We are facing a peculiar situation. Around 22% of seafarers joining in the last one week have tested positive, badly impacting crew change and ship takeover by Indian seafarers. In the next four weeks, RTPCR at joining port will result in disruptions. As a result, seafarers who work on ships have to continue beyond their contract.” A senior officer from the Chennai Port Trust (CPT) said the port management was strictly enforcing the standard operating procedure round the clock. Under this protocol seafarers will have to follow certain procedures from the time they start from their homes till they reach the port. Once aboard the ship, they have to strictly follow yet another set of rules laid down by the ministry, he said. There are pre-arrival checks and post-arrival checks, followed by a combing of shipping crew. For example, when a seafarer lands at a hotel, to reach his room on the first or second floor, the sailor is advised to use the staircase instead of an elevator. “Even customs and immigration authorities were asked not to take the crew members to their rooms for checks. We have asked them to do everything online. If one crew is affected it will have a serious impact on the entire crew travelling on board the vessels,” the official said. Community development officer of Sailors Society Manoj Joy said seafarers are already physically stressed out due to restrictions on their flight travel. Further delays and tests are an added hassle to them, he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/covid-rules-delay-crew-change-at-port/articleshow/88721687.cms||P Oppili
---||Chennai||No ‘public purpose’ in turning Jayalalithaa house into memorial: Madras HC||CHENNAI: The AIADMK’s bid to revive its proposal to convert former chief minister Jayalalithaa’s Poes Garden residence into a memorial failed on Wednesday, when Madras high court rejected its appeal saying there was no ‘public purpose’ involved. A division bench of Justice Paresh Upadhyay and Justice Sathi Kumar Sukumara Kurup, concurring with a single judge’s ruling dated November 24, 2021 that there were procedural illegalities in the acquisition, said: “If the acquisition in question is examined, keeping in view the objects and reasons and the definition of the public purpose in the Land Acquisition Act of 2013, in the facts of this case, we are unable to bring the acquisition of the property in question within four corners of 'public purpose' envisaged under the act.” It was in July 2020 that the erstwhile AIADMK government decided to convert Jayalalithaa’s house – Veda Nilayam – into a memorial. However, on November 24, 2021 quashed the government order and directed the present government to hand over keys of the bungalow to Jayalalithaa’s legal heirs – nephew Deepak and niece Deepa. The DMK government agreed with the high court’s finding and handed over keys to the brother-sister duo on December 10, 2021, even while AIADMK party tried to file a separate appeal after taking the court’s permission. On Wednesday, dismissing the appeal filed by former minister C Ve Shanmugam, the bench pointed out that the leave to prefer this appeal was granted to AIADMK party with a condition that it should explain as to why it did not approach the court when the original writ petitions were heard by the single judge. It said the party had failed to convince the court. The judges also refused to accept the stand taken by AIADMK that at the relevant time AIADMK misconstrued itself as 'appropriate government’ and therefore did not approach the court. According to the petitioners AIADMK and former law minister C Ve Shanmugam, he (Shanmugham) has every right to move an appeal as a member of the Tamil Nadu Puratchi Thalaivi Dr J Jayalalithaa Memorial Foundation which was established to maintain the memorial. Opposing the appeal, legal heirs of Jayalalithaa – J Deepa and J Deepak -- contended that AIADMK lacked locus standi to move the appeal. When the parties to the original litigation, including the state government, had accepted the single judge order, the AIADMK could not prefer an appeal, they said. The present state government, on its part, submitted that it was in agreement with court orders against converting the Poes Garden house into a memorial and, therefore, it did not prefer an appeal against order setting aside acquisition of Veda Nilayam.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/no-public-purpose-in-turning-jaya-house-into-memorial-hc/articleshow/88721688.cms||Suresh Kumar

Justice S M Subramaniam then directed the Tamil Nadu director-general of police to crackdown on the violators and register cases. Asking the DGP to issue advertisements in providing one month to the violators to remove these markings, the judge said: “Cases can be registered under the provisions of the Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act on expiry of the one-month period and the offenders shall be prosecuted following the procedures as contemplated under law.” Justice Subramaniam said: “It is most unfortunate that even a few former constitutional authorities and ex-legislators are misusing the emblems, flags and names by affixing them in their vehicles and in letter pads. The constitutional authorities while holding office and after demitting the office are expected to maintain good conduct under all circumstances.” The oath of office taken by the constitutional authorities under the Constitution is not only for the tenure, but for lifetime, he added. Highlighting the poor implementation of the law, the judge said: “As of now, police authorities and the other competent authorities are totally insensitive with regard to the implementation of the provisions of the act.” Not even a single case has been registered despite the fact that many such offences and violations are noticed by the public at large in public roads, institutions, and buildings. Thus, immediate implementations are imminent and warranted, he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/slap-cases-on-those-misusing-emblems-stickers-hc-tells-dgp/articleshow/88721692.cms||Suresh Kumar

Officials attributed the rise in passengers to higher train frequency, fare cut, opening of north Chennai line, and efficient operations during the monsoon. In 2021, 2.5 crore passengers travelled in metro trains; that’s about 91 per cent of the total passengers that the metro ferried in its first three years. The number, however, is still far less than the initial estimate of 7.8 lakh a day. “Over 1.8 lakh used our services on December 30 when there were heavy monsoon rains and the city roads were choked. We extended our services by an hour that day and we saw over 1,100 people travelling in our trains after 11pm,” an official said. A total of 9.8 crore passengers travelled in metro trains between June 29, 2015, when the metro services started, and December 31, 2021. In a release, CMRL said 2.8 crore passengers travelled between June 29, 2015 and December 31, 2018. The number grew to 3.2 crores in 2019, after phase-1 was completed. The ridership, however, tanked during the suspension of train services between June and September 2020. Officer-goers, who make up the majority of the metro’s commuters, starting to work from home had also affected passenger count. To boost patronage, CMRL converted its executive class into women-only coaches and increased peak-hour timings. “We are also planning other first and last mile connectivity options, apart from the recently launched minibus feeder services. We hope this will encourage more to use our services,” the official added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/chennai-metros-daily-ridership-crosses-pre-covid-numbers/articleshow/88721694.cms||---

With record funding in the startup ecosystem, more tech IPOs, and more wealth in the hands of techies thanks to increased ESOP buybacks, more younger angel investors backed startups this year. In addition, more seasoned corporate executives and serial entrepreneurs launched their startups this year and sought early-stage funding. Over 25% of angel investors were in the age group of 25-30 years in 2021, compared to a negligible proportion in the previous years, as per an analysis of over 7,000 startups by early-stage investor LetsVenture. Over 50% of the founders who applied to raise funds on the platform were serial entrepreneurs and experienced executives over 30 years of age. In previous years, the startup world in India has largely seen seasoned investors and younger founders dominate the sector.On a YoY basis, LetsVenture’s data shows a 75% jump in new angel investors with no prior experience in angel investing registering on the platform in 2021. US, Singapore, UAE, UK and Qatar were the top nations outside India from where angels registered on LetsVenture. On a YoY basis, there was a 10% growth in investors from the US and 43% growth in investors from Singapore, LetsVenture said. Other angel investors TOI spoke to also note a rise in inquiries and new members on its platform in 2021 as startup investing turned into an appealing asset class for corporate houses, traditional stock market investors, and executives flush with large pay packages. Compared to 2020, LetsVenture witnessed a 23% rise in startups applying to the platform to raise funding and a 30% rise in investors registering to angel invest in 2021. The network also recorded a 120% jump in the number of deals, with over 225 transactions done in calendar year 2021. “With Indian startups crossing $100 bn in funding by Oct, there has been a ripple effect across the ecosystem from the early to growth stage, and the capital surplus has led to younger investors coming into the fold(25-30 yrs old) while the average age of founders has increased to 30+,” Sunitha Ramasway, president, LetsVenture, said. IPOs, exits and the Chinese government’s tightening control on tech also led to a lot of US-based investors turning their attention to the Indian market, she added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/angel-investors-turn-younger-founders-more-seasoned-in-21/articleshow/88721695.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

For Indian cryptocurrency exchange WazirX new user registrations from tier-2 & 3 cities saw a 1851% growth, compared to 1759% growth among metro cities in 2021, over the previous year. The high percentage number indicates the low base of the users.Its founder Nischal Shetty said crypto trade adoption was higher among females. “The growth in the number of new female users was up by 1009%, as against an 829% growth recorded in an increase in male sign-ups,” Shetty said.Another crypto exchange, CoinDCX saw increased crypto adoption in cities like Indore, Lucknow and Agra, compared to metros. These crypto investors largely consist of a younger audience — 18 to 34 age category — accounting for more than 70% of the total user base. In terms of regional penetration of the currency, users with native language of Gujarati, Marathi, Tamil, Bengali and Telugu seem to be the top five languages, after Hindi.Sumit Gupta, co-founder and CEO at CoinDCX said, “Among the top geographies, northern region was a key driver of the new currency traffic through a mix of tier-1 and tier-2 cities. Among tier-2 cities across regions, Pune, Patna, Jaipur, Indore and Agra fall in the top 15 overall cities, besides Lucknow”.One of the key developments in 2021 was the acceptance of crypto as a store-of-value asset, traditional institutional investors offering crypto services to their clients. “In terms of top crypto portfolios bought by users, legacy and established tokens like BTC and ETH remain in top five choices, followed closely by meme and utility tokens. In December, 2021, we have also seen keen interest in the audience to explore metaverse based crypto tokens,” said Gupta. Exchanges also said there seems to be a growing interest in crypto amongst women which can be attributed to the growing number of new users, almost 75% of which are women.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/new-user-registrations-for-crypto-grew-faster-in-non-metros-in-2021/articleshow/88721697.cms||Mamtha Asokan

Theatre owners admit that they are still short of achieving the pre-Covid footfalls by over 25%, but movies such as ‘Spiderman No Way Home’, ‘Pushpa’, ‘83,’ etc., have seen single-screen theatres packed which was a major saving grace. “We saw a significant spike in December soon after ‘Akhanda’ hit the screens, especially in rural theatres. The business we got from Pushpa, Spiderman and 83 ensured that all the weekends were houseful,” secretary of Telangana Exhibitors Association M Vijender Reddy told TOI. Despite fear of another lockdown due to the Omicron variant and SS Rajamouli’s ‘RRR’ release being postponed, exhibitors are confident that their collections will continue to shine in January as well. “We can see movies like ‘Rowdy Boys’ and other promising low-budget films coming out this Sankranti season which will be a redeeming feature for us. However, to recover the losses incurred due to Covid-19 will be at least a one-year journey for us,” Vijender Reddy added. Out of 480 single screen theatres across Telangana, 30 of them were shut permanently due to Covid-19 including Hyderabad’s oldest Yakut Mahal. The state government waived electricity charges incurred by theatre owners during these months of shutdown and allowed flexible ticket pricing and the number of shows. However, many theatre owners point that the losses reached a point where resumption was not viable unless the government gave a financial package for them. Fear looms large over a third lockdown in view of Omicron variant amongst movie producers and distributors. Theatre owners are hoping against hope that the government won’t impose another lockdown. “We are hopeful that another lockdown will not be imposed as vaccination has significantly progressed. Several movies are lined up till April and we are confident that things will be positive,” Reddy added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/single-screens-in-hyd-get-much-needed-booster-dose/articleshow/88721700.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

Officials said the exercise of fixing FTL began in 2013 by the authority, but the lake protection committee has now been asked to protect and conserve the lakes. Sources said that of the total 3,532 lakes in HMDA’s jurisdiction, physical survey was completed for 3,114 lakes. “Preliminary notification of lakes along with maps, survey numbers and extent and other details have been declared for 2,195 lakes and 230 of them have been notified with final notification,” a senior official of the HMDA said. Explaining the difference between preliminary and final notification, an official said that in the preliminary notifications only maps, extent, survey numbers and coordinates are mentioned. When it comes to final notification, the complete extent of the lake with revenue and irrigation department surveys, maps, extent of the lake in each survey number and other minute details are added. Sources said that many lakes’ final notification was pending as the revenue and irrigation department reports especially extent and survey numbers were not matching. “The government has clarified that the department which gives higher extent should be considered,’ a senior HMDA official said. To fastrack the lakes FTL as it is linked to beautification and other developmental works, the state government last year made district additional collectors as `nodal officer’ for completing the survey works. The government had already taken up beautification of 40 lakes especially in the GHMC areas and works are in progress in many areas.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/officials-struggle-to-fix-ftls-ahead-of-lake-adoption-plan/articleshow/88721701.cms||Koride Mahesh

In one example, Mufeed Ul Anaam school and Refah-E-Aam High School located at Moghalpura and Kotla Alijah have turned into a breeding grounds for mosquitoes and stray animals coutesey uncleared trash. Though, several complaints have been made to officials concerned, nothing has been done to address the issues.“Garbage in and around certain educational institutions, not only upsets students but also forces parents to hold their children back home. While people are asked to take all possible measures to deal with Omicron variant, how can one deal or stay safe in such an ambience. If authorities are really concerned about public health, they must take note of the condition around schools,’’ a school official told TOI. Overflowing water and pending civic works in Old City have inconvenienced residents. Leaders such as Osman Bin Mohammed Al Hajri and Venu Goud have alleged that officials have failed to solve public problem in the Old City.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/students-hit-as-garbage-covers-schools-in-old-city-localities/articleshow/88721705.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Telangana’s doubling rate of Covid cases faster than first two waves||HYDERABAD: The doubling rate of Covid-19 cases in the state has now become a concern for officials. Over the last week cases have doubled at a rate of two-and-a-half days with the single-largest jump taking place between Sunday and Monday. The state now also has a positivity rate of nearly 3.6 per cent. Going by the state health department’s data, the first major jump during the first wave took 27 days and 12 days during the second wave. Health experts pointed out that if the current trend continues, the state might hit a single-day peak of over 10,000 cases within 15 days if caution is not exercised immediately. During the first wave, the state had a caseload of 94 on June 1, 2020. This escalated to 891 cases as on June 27 following which numbers increased continuously. The state saw another jump on July 8 the same year when cases rose to 1,924. In the second wave, the doubling time had reduced significantly as the state went from 157 cases on March 15, 2021 to 337 cases on March 22. However, from 495 cases on March 27, the state reached 965 cases by April 2. On the current spike in cases, director of health care management centre at the Administrative Staff College of India, Dr Subodh Kadamuthan said, “The increase in cases is much faster than the first and second waves this time and may spread to rural areas as well. It will not be a surprise if the numbers surpass the pandemic’s highest daily peak within the next few days.” Meanwhile, state director of health Dr G Srinvasa Rao told TOI that there was no comparison between the first, second and third waves of the pandemic. “The doubling rate is very quick in the third wave but it is not a surprise. More than number, it is important to focus on symptoms. Symptomatic patients must be cautious,” Dr Rao said. The state director of public health said that the peak in the current wave of infections could be reached in the next three weeks following which case numbers will begin to decline.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/ts-doubling-rate-faster-than-first-2-waves/articleshow/88721711.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

In fact, at the Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences (TIMS), Gachibowli, there are around 63 admitted patients currently. Even as admissions rise, most patients — with mild to moderate symptoms — are being treated on out-patient basis, say doctors. Speaking about treatment, they say that many patients have read up and are asking for the cocktail regimen (antibody cocktail drug) to be given. “In most cases patients are well aware of the regimen and come after having googled about it. They are asking for the regimen by themselves,” said Dr Pradeep Panigrahi, medical director SLG Hospitals, adding that the hospital has just two patients in ICU currently. Elaborating on this line of treatment, Panigrahi, said: “Since these are mildly symptomatic patients who have tested positive in the RT-PCR method, they are being given the cocktail regime with immunoglobulins, which is meant to enhance the body’s defence against the virus.” Agreeing about the requests for the cocktail regime, Dr Sambit Sahu, medical director, KIMS Hospitals Secunderabad, added that “a most patients do not require hospitalisation, are being treated on OP basis.” Currently 423 patients are in ICU, while 509 have been admitted to oxygen beds as per official data. A total of 1,290 Covid beds are occupied across the state. The number of active cases is increasing rapidly, indicating admissions will increase over next few days, doctors say.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/city-hospitals-see-rise-in-covid-related-admissions/articleshow/88721715.cms||Amrita Didyala

The expert panel, which advises the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI), has now asked the Hyderabad-based company to submit protocols for trials for approval.Bharat Biotech had sought approval from DCGI late last month for conducting the Phase III trials on the intranasal vaccine, which is a chimpanzee adenovirus vectored vaccine being developed by the company along with the Washington University (WashU) in St Louis.According to the company, the intranasal vaccines have the potential to prevent transmission and as a booster dose it will be easier to administer in mass vaccination campaigns. While 375-400 volunteers participated in the first phase of the intranasal vaccine trials, around 650 volunteers had signed up for the second phase trials that was conducted across 10 centres in the country.The Phase II trials of the vaccine were heterologous with one cohort being given Covaxin as the first dose and intranasal vaccine as the second dose, volunteers in another cohort getting two doses of intra nasal vaccine and in the third cohort the intranasal vaccine was administered as the first dose followed by Covaxin as the second dose.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/sec-okays-ph-3-booster-trials-for-bbs-intranasal-vaccine/articleshow/88721717.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

Justice Gopinath P considered bail pleas filed by ‘Valiya’ Madhu and Shibu. The court pointed out that a final report has already been filed in the case and asked the accused to approach the trial court with their bail plea as it would be the appropriate forum. CBI’s counsel had submitted before the court that the two minor girls may have been killed and their deaths may have been disguised as suicides. A counsel representing the accused had opposed this and had argued that such a submission goes against the medical records available. The case relates to the unnatural deaths of two sisters, aged 13 and 9, in January and in March of 2017 at Walayar in Palakkad. They were found hanging in their one-room house and it is alleged by prosecution that they committed suicide following repeated unnatural sex committed by the accused on them. There were five accused in the case and one of them had committed suicide in November 2020. In October 2019, a Pocso special court had acquitted three of the accused citing lack of evidence. On appeal filed by the state government, the high court had on January 6 last year, set aside the acquittals and had directed for a CBI probe. After taking over the probe, the CBI had arrested the accused on January 20 last year.

---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Third Covid wave less severe but transmission rate same||LUCKNOW: Hospitalisation and severity of infection among patients in the ongoing third wave of Covid-19 pandemic has been much less so far in comparison to the second wave that ravaged the city in April-May last year, reveals analyses of 500 active cases. However, the rate of transmission this time is almost at par with the second wave. TimesViewHospitalisation among Covid-19 patients in the third wave might be low at this point of time, but healthcare facilities will be overwhelmed if the sharp rise in the transmission rate continues for a month. Such a situation will not only cause physical and financial sufferings to the families of those getting infected, but also hit the economy hard, impacting the entire population. We can avoid this simply by wearing masks, maintaining social distance and hand hygiene.According to district health department data, the number of patients with active infection status in the state capital crossed 500-mark by Tuesday night. All these patients have been reported in the past two weeks. Of these, only 15 patients are under treatment in various hospitals. This means, three patients per 100 infections required hospitalisation. Further, none of the patients in the hospitals have severe infection. While nine are admitted only for isolation, six were diagnosed with the Covid-19 accidentally when they came to hospitals for treatment of some other disease. The number of active cases increased by Wednesday evening, but the trend remained the same. In comparison, the rate of hospitalisation in the first two weeks of the second wave was five per 100 persons. Severity was also high with 10% cases admitted to High Dependency Units or Intensive Care Units. However, health officials and doctors have urged people to follow Covid-19 protocols strictly because even though there are no severe cases so far in the third wave, there is no guarantee that a similar trend will continue as the virus impacts differently in different persons depending on the immune response. Also, still there is not enough data to find out what would be the post-Covid complications. Medical superintendent King George’s Medical University and in charge Covid facility, Prof D Himanshu said, “At present, those admitted have very mild symptoms like that of flu. Most of them are recuperating well on symptomatic treatment. But still, precaution is must because persons with comorbidity and elderly could develop severe symptoms.” Former head microbiology department IMS BHU, Prof Anil Kumar Gulati thinks that vaccination is playing a vital part in less hospitalisation. “Most of the population is covered with at least one vaccine shot. This means they have some immunity against the virus. So obviously, there will be less seriousness (pathogenicity) but we should understand that if Covid protocols are not followed, it might provide a conducive environment for birth of a new variant,” he added. He also explained that as the virus goes from one host to another, it tries to adapt to fight antibodies and often this adaptation process gives birth to another variant, hence it is good that people don't get infected and don't become the new host. Chief medical officer Dr Manoj Agrwal said, “Most of the people found positive are asymptomatic. It makes Covid restrictions more important because they can spread infection unknowingly. We are taking all the measures like extensive testing, contact tracing and isolation but the public must wear masks, use hand sanitizer and follow social distancing.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/third-wave-less-severe-but-transmission-rate-same/articleshow/88720987.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

According to a complaint by a local resident Venkatesh Gajam, the GHMC stray dog catching unit took away their pet dog Bhairava, which had a collar and conducted a sterilisation surgery on December 30. The dog died five days later. Speaking to TOI, Shashikala Kopanati of animal welfare group Earth Quotient said that Venkatesh searched for his dog across five different GHMC animal shelters and found his dog at GHMC veterinary hospital in Charminar zone. “They kept Bhairava in a cage along with five other stray dogs in a very bad condition. When they asked the staff there to return the dog, staff demanded money for all the five dog catchers,” Venkatesh said in his complaint. Subsequently, when the matter was escalated to GHMC officers and veterinary officer Dr Ramachandra Reddy, the dog was released on December 30 at around 5pm,” the details mentioned in the FIR reads. Eventually, Bhairava died on January 4, 2022. Venkatesh pointed that the pet was extremely healthy, vaccinated and happy until he was taken away by the GHMC staff. “He died purely because of botched surgery and criminal negligence of the veterinary doctors. His surgery was done in a completely unprofessional and unhygienic manner, and he was left by the staff in the hospital to rot and die a slow and excruciating death because it was performed by an inexperienced veterinary doctor with extremely poor post-operative care,” the complaint letter reads. Cops booked both the senior GHMC officials under section 429 of IPC (killing or maiming an animal), 11(1)(A) PCAA (subjecting an animal to unnecessary pain or suffering). Police sources said that post-mortem examination has been conducted on the animal and based on the report, further investigation will take place. Repeated attempts to contact both Lokesh Kumar and Abdul Vakil for their comments failed. Text messages sent to their phones also went unanswered.

This will be the first university in south India and unique in terms of courses being proposed. The state government has already developed ‘Bhuddavanam’ in a sprawling 274 acre at Nagarjunasagar and part of the land, about 40 to 60 acre, would be allocated for the university. Nagarjunasagar has been chosen for setting up the university as first Buddhist philosopher and monk, Acharya Nagarjuna, lived at Nagarjunasagar and preached Mahayana. “A proposal has been sent to the state government for allocation of land for the proposed university. A detailed project report has also been prepared. The chief minister will take a call soon,” Buddhavanam special officer Mallepally Laxmaiah told TOI on Tuesday. He said as many as 68 subjects (themes) — Buddhist culture, architecture, literature and other subjects such as medicine, paintings, philosophy, hospitality, martial arts, engineering, administration, management and technology at the time of Buddha — will be taught. A Malaysian group has come forward to develop the university as the owner of the group is a follower of Acharya Nagarjuna. The firm is also setting up a food processing industry at Siddipet. Tourism minister V Srinivas Goud said apart from the Buddhist university, a monastery would be set up by Maha Bodhi Society, Bengaluru, and another by Taiwan-based Fo Guang Shan Monastery, a Chinese Mahayana Buddhist Monastery in Dashu district, Taiwan. “A wellness centre backed by the Dalai Lama will be set up too, while a Delhi-based group wants to construct a hotel for visitors,” he said.  Though Buddhavanam was started during Congress regime, the TRS government fast-tracked the project and completed it at a cost of 68 crore. It is likely to be officially inaugurated by the CM soon. During the inauguration, he is likely to announce the university and a slew of measures to develop the area as part of Buddhist circuit.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/t-mulls-1st-buddhist-varsity-in-south-atnagarjunasagar-eyes-foreign-students/articleshow/88721730.cms||Koride Mahesh

I heard he suffered a cardiac arrest. The TMC will try its best to win the assembly polls in Tripura to reinstate democracy there,” Roy added.Party leader Rajib Banerjee said they had sought permission from police to allow them to submit a memorandum to Tripura governor Satyadeo Narain Arya over deteriorating law and order, and rising unemployment in the state.

A substantial number of children below three years are among those affected. Vaccination for the 15-17 age group began on Monday. The 12-14 age group should logically be the next priority, followed by younger recipients, who remain unvaccinated and hence most vulnerable to infection, say doctors and experts. They, however, point out that most children have so far had mild disease. Read AlsoHow long do Omicron symptoms last?The emerging picture of Omicron suggests that it may be less likely to result in hospitalisation compared with the delta variant. Some early data indicates that Covid-19 from Omicron infections may be less severe, presenting more like a common cold or flu for some patients. Whether that meansChildren of an oncologist with a private hospital, one aged five and another eight months old, have tested positive, both with moderate symptoms. “They could get worse and I’m ready to admit them. I wish children were vaccinated earlier,” said the doctor.Parents of children with Covid are feeling helpless. There are many families with multiple adults affected, along with young children. “My 14-year-old son tested positive on Saturday, while my husband and I have Covid. We are vaccinated, but our son is not and we are worried about him,” said the manager of a private hospital. Symptoms among kids are mild fever, cough and weaknessAccording to paediatrician Shantanu Ray, children and teenagers remain the most vulnerable to Covid and its variants since they are the only unvaccinated section. “During the second wave in April-May, there had been a substantial number of severe cases. This time, most children have had a mild disease but a few have still suffered a drop in oxygen saturation,” he said. “It would have been even better if we could include the 12-15 group now. With the below-15 group excluded, we are yet to offer protection to the paediatric population,” said Ray. Read AlsoCovid vaccination opens for 15-18 years, 22.5% surge in daily cases: Key pointsNEW DELHI: A special Covid-19 vaccination drive for children in the 15 to 18 age group was launched across the country from Monday morning, amid clear signs of the beginning of a fresh Covid wave in the country. The Centre has informed states that only Covaxin is to be administered in thisSo far, the most common symptoms among children with Covid have been mild fever, cough and weakness. A section has had high temperature and breathing distress. It will be wrong to assume that Covid will remain mild post-Omicron, says Institute of Child Health director Apurba Ghosh. “I wish we could vaccinate all children now but there are practical obstacles. It may not be easy to produce so many vaccines together. So, I believe that one segment at a time is a good policy,” said Ghosh. RTIICS intensivist Sauren Panja feels vaccination for the 15-17 age group has started on time and will soon lead to the inclusion of younger groups. “We will probably see the below-15 section being included next month,” said Panja. Peerless microbiologist Bhaskar Narayan Chowdhury pointed out that in the current wave, families are getting infected in clusters with children, too, testing positive. “Unlike in the previous waves, when children often escaped transmission, this time they have been affected in fairly large numbers,” said Chowdhury. In the last two months, several schools in Kolkata reported Covid cases. Many missed their exams due to Covid and nine students wrote CBSE term-I papers in isolation rooms, since they had symptoms.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/unvaxxed-vulnerable-more-kids-testing-ve-in-third-wave/articleshow/88721736.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

Capex during April- December, 2020, was at Rs 7,801 crore.

CIL’s capex during the referred period marked 86.3% of the progressive target achievement. Capex is a key performance area which has a weightage value of 15% in performance evaluation under an MoU. CIL signs an MoU with the ministry of coal at the beginning of every financial year.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Sangh outfits protest against ‘fundamental, extremist’ forces||T’puram/Kottayam: Members of Sangh Parivar organizations took out protest marches and organized public meetings and rallies at over 100 places across the state on Wednesday, demanding strict action against ‘fundamentalist and extremist forces’ operating in the state. The programme, convened by Hindu Aikya Vedi without much publicity and fanfare, was held in view of the recent political killings of RSS workers. Members of various Parivar outfits gathered at various places raising slogans against religious fundamentalism, and blamed the police and state government for their alleged passivity of the violent incidents. Though the protests were targeted at SDPI, the protestors were instructed against sloganeering against organizations by mentioning their name. The state police intelligence wing had reported the possibility of violence in connection with the protest programme, especially since the marches were planned in sensitive areas where SDPI has a palpable presence. Hence, there was heavy deployment of police. A senior functionary of RSS state unit said the protest programme was a natural outcome of Sangh Parivar members, and RSS has no role in it. “RSS never allows extraneous factors to deflect its focus. Being a nationalist organization committed to rear patriotism and promote nationalist feelings in the minds of people, RSS doesn’t work on the principle of enmity. There are people in the organization who believe that voices of protest should be raised against certain forces and developments. They are free to do the same through several Sangh Parivar organizations. RSS doesn’t want to spend energy against anybody. That’s why you don’t see RSS making any statements or justifications regarding the fleeting incidents,” he said. Meanwhile, Senior RSS leader and Hindu Aikya Vedi state working president Valsan Thillankari, who inaugurated the Kannur meeting, accused SDPI of targeting RSS workers and said that RSS was ready to accept the challenge if the government and police are not ready to bring SDPI under control. Peaceful protest in Alappuzha Meanwhile, protest marches were held in various places in Alappuzha district by Hindu Aikya Vedi on Wednesday. Many, including women, took part in the rallies which were held peacefully. There were additional forces deployed in SDPI strongholds through which the rallies passed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/sangh-outfits-protest-against-fundamental-extremist-forces/articleshow/88719685.cms||TNN

Joshi had committed suicide on December 30 by jumping into Nyari dam. Police arrested Hardik Chandarana, an engineer of Madhuram Construction company and employee Mayur Ghodasara. The company had secured a contract for constructing an RCC road. Deceased Joshi, who was deputed in the east zone, was assigned the duty to supervise the work done by the contractor company. Iin her complaint to the police, Joshi’s wife Mili stated that her husband was staying ver tense for some days before committing suicide. He had reportedly told her that he was ‘sandwiched’ between the construction company and his superior. According to police, the company was constructing the roads in the Navagam area where Joshi was not allowed to supervise. When he went there on December 27 with his subordinates, he got a call from Chandarana asking him to leave the site else he would instigate the villagers against him. On December 30 when Joshi came home for lunch, he was very disturbed and told her that Hardik and Mayur won’t let him live peacefully. According to Mili, Joshi was of the opinion that the contractor’s work was of inferior quality. The same day both the accused went to Joshi’s chamber and pressured him to process the bills with retrospective effect which he refused. They allegedly continued to torment him by continuously calling him. Joshi couldn’t take the pressure and committed suicide the same evening. Taluka police inspector JV Dhola said, “We found no involvement of RMC officials, but if we get evidence, we will take action.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/surat/two-held-for-abetting-suicide/articleshow/88719663.cms||---

Under the DBT scheme launched by chief minister Yogi Adityanath on November 6, Rs 1,100 were transferred to the Aadhaar seeded bank accounts of parents of 1.8 crore children enrolled in state-run and aided schools from classes 1 to 8 across the state. The scheme is introduced with an aim to eliminate middlemen and quality issues which erupt almost every year. According to the report generated by the government after taking feedback from beneficiaries through the CM helpline, around 13,473 beneficiaries said they didn’t receive the funds even after checking their bank accounts regularly while 22,304 beneficiaries (parents of kids enrolled in government schools) said they didn’t check their bank accounts. Among 64,311 parents who got the money, 51,997 said they did purchase the requisite stuff — uniforms, sweaters, shoes and socks and school bag — for their children. The 12,000 beneficiaries who didn’t purchase cited varied reasons. While 1,378 beneficiaries said the funds given by the government were inadequate for buying the school material for kids, 368 beneficiaries said they were using things provided by the school in the previous year. Another 206 beneficiaries said they used the money in purchasing stuff other than uniforms, sweaters, shoes, socks and school bag. Over 10,000 beneficiaries reported other reasons for not making the purchase. Post the feedback report, basic education director Sarvendra Vikram Bahadur Singh has directed district level officers to follow up with the parents so that no one is left from availing the benefit. In a communique to the basic education officers (BSAs), Singh asked them to gather details of those 13,473 parents who didn’t receive the money in their bank accounts through the IGRS login. BSAs have been asked to make available the list at block level, appoint a nodal officer against each parent and verify the bank accounts. “The exercise is to be done on priority so that they give a positive feedback next time when inquired on the CM helpline,” Singh directed BSAs.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/cm-helpline-report-finds-58-kids-got-money/articleshow/88720990.cms||Isha Jain

It was announced that schools in ‘Nagpur grameen’ (rural), along with four other talukas will be closed till at least January 31. In common parlance, Nagpur Rural is a term used generically for areas outside city limits. But that’s not the case as far as official land records are concerned. Nagpur Grameen/Rural is a properly defined area classified as a tehsil which surrounds certain tracts of city’s boundary. As per the official map, Nagpur Rural comprises of three non-contigious land tracts which share their border with NMC limits. This vast area is home to many well known private and government schools, with some areas like Beltarodi, Jamtha and Gondhni being ones with which readers would be familiar. A CBSE school principal told TOI that this was the first time they came to know about it. “Ever since Covid-19 struck and the government started issuing orders, we would all come to know what the rules are either for city or rural. The general understanding was that Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) issues orders for city while the district collector’s office does the same for rural. So when I heard that schools in Nagpur rural and certain talukas are the only ones that are closed, it became very confusing,” said the principal. Another principal echoed the same sentiment. “Why does the government make everything so complicated. Why micro-manage different tehsils and this Nagpur Rural territory is even more confusing for us. The wise thing would have been to shut down all schools and not create this confusion,” said the principal. The four other tehsils in which schools shall remain closed are Saoner, Kamptee, Kalmeshwar and Hingna. With no separate order coming in from the district collector’s office, school principals were worried about making the announcement to parents. A principal said, “Usually we always send the government circular along with our message of school closure/reopening. This way nobody questions us. Now if I ask my teachers to start informing parents, it will lead to hundred questions on where the written order is.” She said with NMC issuing a written directive, parents in Nagpur Rural area schools will be a bit confused. “We always get stuck between government and parents. Both sides are confused because of lack of communication and we are pulled up for anything that goes wrong. To be on the safer side, we will just announce school closure even if there is no circular,” she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/nagpur-grameen-school-closure-word-creates-confusion-among-academics/articleshow/88719670.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

Covid beds in its hospitals have also been increased by over 1,000. In an order issued on Tuesday, Delhi government’s department of health and family welfare directed state government-run hospitals to increase the number of beds reserved for treating Covid patients. Indira Gandhi Hospital in Dwarka has been asked to increase the number of Covid beds from 1,181 to 1,500, and Lok Nayak to add 100 more beds to the present 650. GTB hospital will add 150 beds to its 600 reserved for Covid. Delhi government’s new hospital in Burari will increase Covid beds from 300 to 400, while Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty hospital will the reserved beds to 300, and Ambedkar Nagar Hospital will increase them from 135 to 200, and Deen Dayal Upadhyay, Deep Chand Bandhu and Dr Baba Saheb Ambedkar each from 100 to 150. These will increase the Covid beds in Delhi government hospitals from 3,316 to 4,350. The order also asks all hospital authorities to ensure full preparations to engage necessary manpower and equipment to meet up the bed escalation. Covid isolation centres with 3,685 beds, including paid facilities in five-star and three-star hotels and budget hotels and guest houses, have been activated. Jain tweeted on Wednesday that according to the Union health ministry’s new guidelines, Covid-positive patients need to stay in home isolation for seven days instead of 14. In these 7 days, if the patients did not show any symptoms for three consecutive days, they could be discharged from home isolation without a Covid test. “If you have come in contact with a corona-positive person but do not have any symptoms, there is no need to get yourself tested. Do not panic, isolate yourself and keep checking your fever and oxygen level regularly at home,” Jain said in another tweet. The minister also tweeted that Covid-positive patients recuperating in home isolation should isolate themselves from other members of the household, stay in an airy room with cross-ventilation, wear a triple-layer mask, take special care of cleanliness and keep themselves busy. They must not neglect to talk to family and relatives on the phone, he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/hotels-to-again-double-up-as-covid-centres/articleshow/88720991.cms||Sidharatha Roy

A week has passed since the incident took place but the accused has not been arrested yet. The victim, a BA first year student at Naihati RBC College and a resident of Beliaghata, was returning home from Sodepur after meeting her friend.The girl sustained jaw, leg and head injuries as she had landed on the railway track. The GRP team rescued the girl and rushed her to the Bidhannagar sub-divisional hospital. Later, she was shifted to a nursing home in Barrackpore, shwre she is still undergoing treatment for her injuries.A complaint was lodged with Sealdah GRP station.“My daughter had boarded a Sealdah-bound Naihati local from Sodepur station around 8.40pm. The compartment was almost empty while the train left the Dum Dum station for Bidhannagar station. Suddenly, a youth brandished a knife and tried to snatch her purse and mobile.

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Cocktail therapy craze refuses to die down||KOLKATA: Even though monoclonal antibody cocktail therapy has been removed from the mandatory Covid treatment protocol in the state, requests are still pouring in from patients keen to take it. This, they believe, will lead to a definite and early cure. Most hospitals, however, have decided to use it only on symptomatic patients with co-morbidities and the rest are being given normal Covid treatment. Although used rampantly over the last few weeks, there is yet no “conclusive, unbiased and sustained evidence” on the effectiveness of cocktail therapy to include it in the treatment protocol, said RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) intensivist Sauren Panja. “We are using it on senior citizens who are symptomatic. It has got around 70% effectiveness, so cocktail therapy is no magic cure. More importantly, all patients don’t require it, especially those without symptoms. So, we are now following a strict policy of administering it to the 60-plus patients with symptoms,” said Panja. The rush for the therapy was triggered by the fact it was new and promised a cure, according to Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education & Research (IPGMER) professor Diptendra Sarkar. “It may not be effective against Omicron, which is a mutated strain. More importantly, it will be a waste on young patients without co-morbidities since they just don’t need it,” he said. Hospitals had started using the therapy since it allowed them to treat patients in day care and release them, keeping bed occupancy low. Hospitals like Belle Vue Clinic and Woodlands used it on more than 50 patients each since last week and 80% of them were released in a day. “Consultant clinicians will take the final call on the clinical management of any patient, including Covid, on a case-to-case basis. We have received the new protocol and will abide by it,” said Rupali Basu, managing director & CEO, Woodlands Multispeciality Hospital. Medica Superspecialty Hospital continues to use it on senior citizens with co-morbidities. “We have had requests for it even before the new protocol removed it. But we continue to use it on those who really need it,” said chairperson Alok Roy. At Peerless Hospital, use of cocktail therapy has been restricted. “Many patients are still insisting on it, but we are using it only on those with more than moderate symptoms,” a source said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/cocktail-therapy-craze-refuses-to-die-down/articleshow/88721740.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

These students had missed their semester one examinations, which were held offline earlier, either due to Covid or severe health issues. The CISCE, in a meeting with the schools on Wednesday, gave its nod to go ahead with the reassessment tests according to the original schedule. In Kolkata, the number of students who will take this reassessment examinations are not more than 50.However, there remains a worry over the timeline to conduct internal assessment, like submission of project for Class X and practical examinations for Class XII. In December, CISCE had asked schools to complete this within January 31. These assessments are part of the semester-I examination sc-ore sheets. In Kolkata, nearly nine examination centres have been identified where students will take the tests, which means that not more than two-four students will be present at one centre and each centre will have one invigilator. Board students from many schools, like St Xavier’s Collegiate School, La Martiniere for Boys’ School, Calcutta Boys’ School, and DPS Newtown, had missed the semester-I exams due to illness. “In our school, three students will be appearing for ISC (semester-I) examinations on January 10, since they could not appear for them earlier due to severe medical conditions. Now they have completely recovered,” said Delhi Public School Newtown principal Sonali Sen.The internal assessment and practicals still pose a challenge for the Board and schools. St Augustine’s Day School, Shyamnagar, had the scheduled timetable starting from Wednesday, which has been cancelled due to the government directive; other schools are in a dilemma about how to conduct the practical assessment. “We will wait till January 15 to get clarity from both the Board and the state before we decide anything. Children’s well-being is everyone’s priority,” said St Augustine’s Day School, Shyamnagar, principal Fr Rodney Borneo. Ram Mohan Mission High School has prepared a timetable for the assessment starting from January 14 and the school authority has decided to wait.Usually, practical exams are held before the board exams. This year, board exams were divided into two and internal assessment for classes X and XII were scheduled in between. Class X students have projects worth 20 marks, which have been received by most schools; even viva can be conducted virtually. However, the issue is about offline practicals for students of lab-based subjects, like physics, chemistry, biology and computer, where externals will be present at the time of assessment.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/50-kids-to-take-offline-cisce-reassessment-test-from-jan-10/articleshow/88721741.cms||---

The government has suspended offline classes due to a surge in Covid cases and the authorities of colleges and universities have been asked to impart lessons and conduct exams online till further instructions. The principals are worried with several teachers and non-teaching staff testing positive for the virus. However, online classes have not been cancelled in any institute and the authorities have already started sanitising their campuses and advising teachers to get tested and report if they suspect any symptom. At Jadavpur University, Aurobindo Bhavan and Central Library were shut for sanitisation on January 3 after “some employees” tested positive. Online classes have not been affected, said an official. “A detailed notice has also been issued to all the departments on how the offices will function with minimum number of people required to attend the office,” said an official of the university. Several associations of college teachers and professors have also been receiving the reports of their members being infected. “In the past three or four days we are being informed about the teachers of various colleges testing Covid positive. While the number is higher than it had been during the first and the second waves but it has not yet reached a level where online teaching might get affected. We are requesting everybody to follow all the safety guidelines and test immediately if they have any of the suspected symptoms,” said Debasish Sarkar, general secretary of West Bengal Government College Teachers’ Association. Principal are worried about the semester examinations scheduled to start next week and internal examinations that are currently underway in many colleges. “Most colleges are short-staffed anyway. But we have to finish the syllabus and conduct the exams online. The pandemic has wasted a lot of time,” said a principal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/infections-cripple-colleges-varsities/articleshow/88721742.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: 560 arrested for breaking Covid norms, 540 unmasked booked||KOLKATA: Cops have stepped up mask arrests further on Wednesday across central and south Kolkata where 560 people were arrested for not abiding by Covid appropriate behaviour. Another 540 people were prosecuted for not wearing masks properly across the city. Around 70 motorists were detained for the violation of Covid norms while cops stopped over 700 cars and booked the motorists for breaking the night restrictions. The commissioner Vineet Goyal has ordered all police stations to help traffic cops in conducting raids in this regard. In a significant decision, the Kolkata traffic police also discontinued seizing documents during spot fines. “Instead of physically seizing documents, we will go for more citation cases. In addition, we will technically show certain documents as seized even though they will not be in our direct possession. Unless motorists pay the fine, the documents will be shown as “seized” at the time of renewal. This has been done to cut down on contacts with motorists,” said an officer at Lalbazar. On Wednesday, several cops were found boarding buses and autos and pulling out those who were not wearing masks. “We have not prosecuted them with a simple fine. We took them to the police station where they had to pay a fine and in certain cases, they had to apply for bail,” said an officer. At Burrabazar, the OC himself boarded some buses and caught the violators. About 80% of these special checks were conducted at the boundaries of the city along with the areas like Burrabazar-Posta, Park Street and Park Circus - where blatant violations have been higher. The total number of prosecutions, claimed Lalbazar, is one of the highest since July, when the second Covid wave died down.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/560-arrested-for-breaking-cov-norms-540-unmasked-booked/articleshow/88721743.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Gagan Sachdeva, a senior member of the forum who drafted the letter, said the survival of more than 5,000 such establishments with more than 2 lakh employees is at stake. “Our businesses have virtually collapsed and many of us are on the verge of bankruptcy. We are also open to the idea of running the gyms at 50% capacity in a shift-wise manner and are ready to adhere to the strictest of guidelines,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/gym-owners-write-to-cm/articleshow/88721744.cms||---

Bidhannagar DC (headquarter) confirmed Sarkar’s illness, adding that six other police officers of the commissionerate are also suffering from the infection. Aloke Kumar Sarker, OC Beniapukur also tested positive for Covid on Wednesday. Earlier in September, 2020, he was diagnosed with severe Covid. Sarker has much milder symptoms this time, though he is being monitored at home. He is among the fresh 52 cases reported on Wednesday — the highest one-day spike in cases since April 2020 that took the total cases to 183 and active cases to 166.

While approximately 50 people, including a few senior officials, tested positive at Swasthya Bhawan in Salt Lake, around 20 healthcare workers at NICED reportedly tested positive, including the institute’s director Shanta Dutta. The lab attached with NICED has been testing Covid samples since the beginning of the pandemic. Most of the infected are mildly symptomatic and are in home isolation. The number of infected healthcare workers and medical students have risen rapidly in medical colleges across Kolkata. Some colleges have even decided to shut down hostels for some time to prevent mass infection among MBBS students. NRS has around 200 infected, Medical College Hospital Kolkata has 250, Calcutta National Medical College has over 200, RG Kar has 120 and Chittaranjan Seva Sadan has over 100 affected healthcare workers and students.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/20-test-ve-at-niced-50-at-swasthya-bhawan/articleshow/88721746.cms||---

The Met officials have predicted a slow rise in the mercury from Thursday with a western disturbance (WD) about to intervene in the path of the northwesterly winds that have brought in the chill. The impact of the WD may be felt from Thursday onwards, said an official of Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC).“We don’t expect rain in Kolkata but it could remain cloudy. There will be a rise in the minimum temperature and it could touch 15 degrees over the next 48 hours. The chill will disappear,” said RMC director G K Das.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/met-spies-slow-rise-in-temp-from-today-chill-may-disappear/articleshow/88721747.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Not on list, but most complexes enforce C-zone rules to stay safe||Kolkata: Multiple housing complexes not on the list of micro-containment zones have started taking up containment zone-like measures. They have imposed strictures like, limiting entry of outsiders, including maids, stopping mass gatherings in common areas, imposing fine for not wearing masks, pushing back association elections and shutting down clubs and banquet halls to prevent the spread of Covid.At South City, that has over two dozen active cases, the authorities have sealed common areas and put up posters making masks mandatory and informing residents of a Rs 100 fine for violations. “We have also increased fogging and other sanitisation activities in the common areas,” said Manoj Gupta, secretary of the complex residents’ association.At Sarosi Complex in Kasba, where there are four families in isolation, the authorities have increased sanitisation while stressing on whole-body fogging before entering the complex. “We can’t stop the entry of outsiders as we have two banks inside. Hence we are stressing on sanitisation and fogging,” said Sujata Ghosh, a senior member of the association.At Diamond City South in Behala, which has 30-odd families suffering from Covid and staying in isolation, one of the towers has been declared a micro-containment zone on Wednesday. However, the authorities said, even before that, they had taken a slew of safety measures. “We pushed back our association election and banned walking in groups. Even before the government order, we had shut down our gyms and pools and had instructed all labourers working here to leave within seven days,” said Deepak Agarwal, a member of the residents’ body.At New Town’s Sunrise Green Apartments, where there were 15-odd Covid patients till Wednesday, the authorities have started limiting entry of part-time maids and have formed a special emergency management team to combat the situation with proper protocols and communications. “We are allowing delivery men, but are discouraging residents from inviting guests. We have banned house parties,” said association secretary Subhasis Mazumdar.At DLF New Town Heights and Merlin Emerald in Ultadanga, the authorities have asked a section of housekeeping staff and security guards to stay at the complex to cut down outside interference. “We have increased the intensity of sanitisation and have stopped gatherings in the common area,” said Sameer Sharma of DLF New Town Heights.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/not-on-list-but-most-complexes-enforce-c-zone-rules-to-stay-safe/articleshow/88721748.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Kolkata||Flyer count drops even before partial ban sets in||Kolkata: Air travel to and from Kolkata has dropped significantly in the past week, even before the partial ban on flights from Delhi and Mumbai kicks in from Thursday.While Kolkata airport had clocked 49,360 passengers on December 25 and 51,237 on December 26, it fell to 38,841 on Tuesday, a drop of 25%. This is for the first time since November 6 that the airport has recorded footfall below 40,000.With the four-day-a-week ban for flights from Mumbai and Delhi coming into effect from Thursday, airline officials said the numbers are set to decline further. With very few flights from Delhi and Mumbai on Wednesday due to the eleventh hour change in the state's ban notification on Tuesday evening, the passenger figure may have reduced by 10,000 on Wednesday.Airlines said as the amendment came only on Tuesday evening, by then they had already cancelled Wednesday flights and had either rescheduled or refunded the passengers and thus operated only a handful of flights, resulting in a huge slump in passenger footfall on Wednesday.“The revised schedule was already chalked out with all direct flights from Delhi and Mumbai cancelled on five days of the week other than Mondays and Fridays based on the Sunday's order from the state government when the revised order arrived on Tuesday evening. By then, it was too late to make any major changes. But this is what we will now experience on Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays," an airline official said.Five flights arrived in Kolkata from Delhi and Mumbai and four departed to these cities from Kolkata on Wednesday. That is against the usual schedule of over 40 flights from these metros. “I was booked on a flight to Bagdogra this Saturday for a trip to Darjeeling with my family. But I have cancelled it at this moment,” said Saugata Banerjee, a finance executive.Another flyer Dibyendu Saha, who had initially thought of coming back home with his family from Delhi after work from home strictures returned to his office, has also decided to stay back in his Gurgaon flat at this moment. “I guess there would be extreme rush on flights from Delhi on the three days and I don’t want to risk an infection jostling in the crowd,” said Saha, a graphic designer.“We will see fluctuating passenger figures with more passengers on Fridays, Wednesdays and Fridays when Delhi and Mumbai flights are allowed to operate to Kolkata than the rest of the week," an airline official said.The figures could continue its downward spiral if Covid cases continue to shoot up. Airport authorities said they were hoping for a turnaround of sorts for the aviation sector in Bengal as the city airport clocked 50 lakhs odd passengers in December this year, bettering 2020’s December footfall by over 50%. However, with the third wave striking right at the end of the year, things look gloomy at this moment for the sector.“We had almost caught up with pre-Covid like passenger footfall at the airport but the third wave has hit us badly again. The passenger figures are likely to go down further in the coming weeks and I believe it would take us more than two months to recover from this slump,” said C Pattabhi, the airport director.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/flyer-count-drops-even-before-partial-ban-sets-in/articleshow/88721749.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Kolkata||Home isolation cut to 7 days; relief for hospitals, patients||Kolkata: Shortening of the mandatory home isolation period for the asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic Covid patients to seven days has brought a huge relief to hospitals that are facing a manpower crisis. With a large number of doctors, nurses and healthcare workers currently infected and put under home isolation, some hospitals are already finding it difficult to attend to patients. But now many health workers will be able to return to work faster with the mandatory isolation period being reduced to a week. “The shortening of this home isolation period is going to lessen the manpower crisis in hospitals to a great extent. In fact, the possibility of cutting down this home isolation period further for the asymptomatically infected are under discussion,” said IPGMER gastroenterology head GK Dhali, state’s officer on special duty on Covid-19.The state government is also mulling measures like allowing health workers to come back to work if they test negative to two rapid antigen tests conducted 24 hours apart even before this seven-day span. Along with several doctors, nurses and health workers, the DHS and DME have also tested positive. This apart, around 70 KMC doctors and frontline Covid warriors are also down with Covid.On Tuesday, TOI had reported that the state government was condsidering shortening of this isolation period but was waiting for the ICMR nod. The state health officials had expected five days as the period for home isolation. Initially, it was 14 days and then it had got curtailed to 10 days, before the revised guideline on Wednesday.“The changed home isolation protocol is a relief to some extent. About 40% to 50% of our workforce who are now under hosme isolation should be able to come back to work in the next two to three days,” said R Venkatesh, regional director (East) of Narayana Health. Currently, all hospitals across the city have between 30 to 300 workers infected and most are under home quarantine. “This changed guideline is going to have a direct and positive impact in maintaining patient care services,” said Asis Manna, MSVP of Infectious Diseases & Beliaghata General Hospital.Critical care specialist Sauren Panja has been on home isolation since Tuesday when he tested positive but he has only mild cough and nasal block. Panja and his team currently has 70 odd critical care patients, including 20 Covid-19 infected under its wing at RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences. “In fact, home isolation period should be brought down further, otherwise who will be treating patients in hospitals. While I am consulting patients online, this medium cannot be used for caring all types of patients. I will go back to hospital after this mandatory seven-day isolation,” said Panja.The new guideline says the isolation ends on the seventh day testing positive with no fever in the past three days. There is no need for repeat testing. “Also, one doesn’t want to waste their leave in the beginning of the year. This new guideline is going to help other industries as well,” said Sudipta Mitra, CEO of Peerless Hospital.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/home-isolation-cut-to-7-days-relief-for-hospitals-patients/articleshow/88721750.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kolkata||‘I collected 139 samples in 2 days’||Kolkata: When the second wave had hit the city, I was worried. As a phlebotomist, associated with a diagnostic centre that has several branches in the city, I was asked to collect around 40 samples for RT-PCR tests. on certain days, it even crossed 50. I was relieved when numbers began going down gradually from June. So were my fellow phlebotomists. But by Christmas, when I saw the crowd on the city streets, I prayed that the Omicron variant delays its entry. But this New Year, especially the past 96 hours, has been no less than a nightmare. Asked to collect samples in an area stretching across Budge Budge-Behala-New Alipore, I collected 68 samples on Tuesday and 71 more on Wednesday. And yet, there are many others whom I had to refuse. I understand that everyone is worried but even we have our limits. One essential question we keep facing is why we are not wearing PPE kits. I will give my example. Whenever I have too many collections from a single house, and based on the symptoms they display, I wear a PPE kit. On most occasions of single or dual collections, I am not wearing the kit. It doesn’t mean I am not worried about my own health. I always wear two masks and change my gloves each time I take a fresh collection. But tell me, where will I dispose off so many PPE in such a short duration? Where is the time to wear one and get out of it, especially when most people even refuse to let us enter their drawing rooms fearing we are carrying the virus? For the past four days, I have been leaving home around 5.30am. When I reached a house around 6.30am, the family asked me if they were the first house I visited that day, but I told them they were the fourth family. I only return home around 7pm in the evening. But even then I cannot relax. Whenever my patients are unable to contact anyone back at the head office, they keep enquiring. This time, entire families are getting Covid positive and hence tests within families are higher. Often one report lags another. This creates tension and the patients call me to clarify. There are certain software issues due to excessive pressure. But my office has been extremely supportive in these tough times. I take these as challenges. I am fervently hoping things turn for the better from next month.(Deb Burman, a phlebotomist, spoke to Dwaipayan Ghosh)||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-collected-139-samples-in-2-days/articleshow/88721751.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Genome sequencing only for Cov+ int’l travellers||Kolkata: The state health department has decided to do away with sending all positive samples — with CT value within 30 — for genome sequencing. All labs have now been asked to send only positive samples of people who have recent international travel history for whole genome sequencing.According to sources, the decision has been taken due to the high volume of samples being received from private labs at the only two labs for sequencing. Also the pressure on the lab at School of Tropical Medicine was mounting to extract RNA from these samples in addition to running a significantly high number of Covid-19 samples. “A good number of samples have been collected from private labs. In wake of the sharp surge in positive cases, a large number of positive samples are getting accumulated for genome sequencing. Therefore, labs have been asked to stop positive samples from the community for the time being,” said a source in the health department.TOI on December 24 had reported about the policy to include samples from all Kolkata labs that have CT value within 30 for genome sequencing. A couple of days later labs under Salt Lake, Rajarahat, and Howrah were also included. With a positivity rate as high a 50% to 70% in these labs, each has sent positive samples ranging between 50 and 100 for genome sequencing so far. The initiative was taken up to determine local transmission of Omicron.“Instead of doing away all positive samples from the community, we should still carry on sequencing about 5% of these positive samples. Whole genome sequencing is not only about detecting Omicron but to track virus mutation, emerging of new variants and sub-lineages of such variants,” said Bhaskar Narayan Chaudhuri microbiologist at Peerless Hospital.The state has also asked all labs to keep its OPDs running for collecting and testing samples on Sundays and holidays. Labs are expected to analyse their own data of the test results so that they can alert health officials if they notice surge in any specific pockets.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/genome-sequencing-only-for-cov-intl-travellers/articleshow/88721752.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kolkata||Covid transforms mindset on owning homes, office space||Kolkata: The pandemic has transformed people's mindset about homes and office spaces. While it has led many families residing in rented accommodation with no immediate plans to buy a property to actually make a purchase, companies that have been evaluating their strategy after the introduction of less crowding and work from home concept are experimenting with managed workspaces. “During the economic and psychological disruption that happened during the lockdown in the wake of the pandemic in March 2020, people realized the value of owning a home. Those who lived in their own homes felt more secure than those who lived in rented accommodation that suddenly felt more vulnerable as income became uncertain with salary cuts and job losses. That quest for security has fuelled the growth in home sales. The sops announced by the state government in July 2021 further accelerated the home-buying decision," said international property consultant Knight Frank's India market chief economist and research director Rajani Sinha.Consequently, the residential market in Kolkata reversed a seven-year trend in declining sales and also recorded the highest unit sales in five years. In 2021, the 14,405 units sold was 62% more than 9,290 units sold in 2020. The combined sales of 23,317 units in the two years happened in practically 17 months with three months in 2020 lost during the first wave and four months in 2021 lost during the second wave.Share of the upper end of the affordable segment homes in the price range of Rs 50 lakhs to Rs 1 crore increased from 19% in the second half of 2020 to 25% in the corresponding period in 2021. Also, 7,510 new residential units were launched in 2021, an increase of 81% against 4,148 units launched in 2020 when hardly any new projects were launched. Unsold inventory has also declined from 28,160 units in 2020 to 21,265 units in 2021. The year also saw a shift in mindset of companies about workspaces with many realizing offices were important as a flag of stability, foster office culture and encourage innovation through collaboration. "We are currently in the evaluation and experimental stage of office space. Until evolution happens, managed spaces appear to be the answer. In Kolkata, over 5 lakh sq ft of serviced office space has been added by Awfis, Infinity Business, Apeejay, EFC, Workshaala, Smart Works, Akasa, Urbn Wrk, Mangalam Business Centre and Regus," said Knight Frank Kolkata head Swapan Dutta.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/covid-transforms-mindset-on-owning-homes-office-space/articleshow/88721753.cms||Subhro Niyogi

Late on Tuesday evening, chairperson Raj Chakraborty had tweeted to inform that he had tested positive. This is the second time that he has been infected. Incidentally, Chakraborty was on his way to recovering from chicken pox when he tested positive. Parambrata Chattopadhyay, chairperson of the short and documentary section and a part of KIFF’s advisory committee, tested positive on Wednesday. He attended Tuesday’s KIFF press conference at Sisir Mancha. On Wednesday morning, Chakraborty spoke to everyone involved with the festival. “Many organizing the festival have tested positive. I also had a word with chief secretary and principal secretary of the I&CA department. All of us felt the festival ought to be deferred now. I then spoke to our chief minister. We will have the festival once the situation improves,” he said. Arindam Sil, KIFF’s apex advisory committee member, said, “The film committee requested our chief minister to call off the festival. I am thankful to her for paying heed to our request and putting health before anything else. Watching films is a festival. That can’t happen in such times of sickness.” Premendra Mazumder, vice president of Federation of Film Societies of India (FFSI), has welcomed the decision. “FFSI is one of the official collaborators of KIFF since its inception. This is the correct decision keeping in mind the Covid surge,” he said.  Director Amartya Bhattacharya, whose film ‘Adieu Godard’ was in the Indian languages competitive section, called the decision “wise”. “We were so excited about KIFF and some of our cast and crew were to arrive at Kolkata on Friday. But celebrations can happen only after the situation improves. I’m waiting for the situation to get better and for the new dates. I'm sure the postponed KIFF 2022 will be bigger and better.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/kiff-deferred-after-steady-rise-in-covid-numbers/articleshow/88721754.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Lucknow||BJP pays tributes to Kalyan, party’s first Hindutva icon||Lucknow: BJP leaders paid rich tributes to former UP CM late Kalyan Singh on his 90th birth anniversary on Wednesday marking the saffron outfit’s deep reverence for the leader who signified hardcore Hindutva and during whose regime the Mughal era Babri mosque was razed by a mob of frenzied karsevaks on December 6, 1992. Salutations for Kalyan — he passed away in August last year after prolonged illness — poured in from top BJP brass, including Union home minister Amit Shah, BJP national president JP Nadda, defence minister Rajnath Singh and CM Yogi Adityanath. Shah remembered Kalyan for his ‘unparalleled’ role to the Ram Temple in Ayodhya and dedicating his life for emancipation of the poor and backward. In a tweet, Shah posted a picture of Kalyan and described him as a ‘living example’ of nationalism and good governance. “Babuji aise jana nayak the, jinke jeevan ka har kshan gareebon va pichhadon ke utthan ko samarpit raha...Ram mandir hetu unka adviteeya tyag va samarpan vandaniya hai...,” Shah said. He also lauded Kalyan’s tenure for ensuring robust law and order and taking measures for improvement in the education sector. Nadda remembered Kalyan as a leader who played an important role in the Ram temple movement. “Babuji’s life was devoted to the service of the nation and uplift of the poor. His life inspires all of us,” he said. Defence minister Rajnath Singh tweeted: “Kalyan Singh was a pillar of Indian politics, not just in Uttar Pradesh. He worked lifelong for welfare of the poor, farmers, and backward classes. My heartfelt tributes to him.” CM Yogi termed Kalyan as a popular mass leader and a conscientious member of BJP family who made an incomparable contribution to the Ram Mandir movement. “Respected Babu ji will always be remembered for his firm decisions and clean life,” Yogi tweeted. The tributes to Kalyan were keenly read with political pertinence as the BJP seeks to whip up its tried and tested Hindutva card to torpedo the opposition’s castle built around caste matrix ahead of the high stakes UP assembly polls. Experts pointed out that Kalyan was being repeatedly invoked in most BJP rallies recently, especially those organised in and around Etah and Bulandshahr. BJP has been seeking to cash on Kalyan’s Hindutva credentials and his iron fist policy on law and order to draw a parallel with the Yogi regime. BJP sources said that in the run up to 2017 assembly elections Shah used to promise a ‘Kalyan Singh-type of government’ in his campaign rallies.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/bjp-pays-tributes-to-kalyan-partys-first-hindutva-icon/articleshow/88721015.cms||Pankaj Shah

The following day, two friends of her parents had come over to her house. One day later, she developed low-grade fever and cough. When her parents also developed similar symptoms two days later, they underwent Covid test. The virus was found in all of them.Roshan had gone to a New Year’s Eve rooftop party with friends despite his wife’s warning. Two days later, he developed symptoms that initially seemed like common cough and cold but he now suspects it’s Covid. Anuradha had been extremely careful all along. But when a wedding in the family beckoned, she flew down to attend it. Though a private affair with only a few close family members in attendance, she still contracted the virus. As did several others.The mutated virus lurking around appears to have turned so insidious that it isn’t sparing even a moment’s carelessness. “I am usually masked whenever anyone is around, even at home. These past 21 months, I have not had any interaction with friends without the mask in place. On Christmas eve, I had gone to a friend’s place and had the mask on till the food arrived. That is the only time I let my guard down,” recounted Shoi. Her mother isn’t sure whether she contracted the virus then or when a couple of her friends had come over to the house and spent a few hours with the family. “We sat at a reasonable distance from each other. If meeting others was letting our guard down, we did. But we were still careful. Obviously, it wasn’t enough,” she said.Roshan had stayed away from parties till New Year’s Eve. That night, he could not resist the temptation to ring in the new year with friends. “The next day, I went out on a drive in a car with a sunroof that was open. It was on the following day that I developed the symptoms. Initially, I thought it was cold. Though I have not tested yet, the body ache, low-grade fever and tiredness all matches Covid symptoms,” he admitted.Anuradha had avoided gatherings since the outbreak of the pandemic in 2020. But she could not turn down the invitation to a wedding in the family. “How could meeting a select few close members of the family who behaved responsibly be a threat?” she had reasoned with herself. How wrong the argument had proved. Two days later, nine family members had contracted Covid. “We don't know who may have infected whom. But if a family cannot meet, it is scary,” she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/lowered-guard-for-a-day-paying-the-price/articleshow/88721757.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Entire families getting Cov-positive this time||Kolkata: North Kolkata traffic guard sergeant Chinmoy Mukherjee had been on duty all night on Christmas Day as well as New Year. Barely a day later, on the night of January 2, his nine-year-old daughter had high fever and an upset stomach. A little after midnight, his wife, too, began to show Covid symptoms, headache and high fever. Mukherjee decided to isolate himself, but he also came down with high fever the next morning. All of them tested positive for Covid the next day. Sarod player Pt Tejendra Narayan Majumdar, along with wife Manasi, tested positive for Covid on Wednesday. Two days ago, his son, Indrayuddh Majumder, had tested positive. “We received our second dose of vaccination in June. All three of us are in home isolation. My wife has no symptom. My son had fever but the temperature has subsided. I have mild symptoms. We are in constant touch with our physician and following all instructions,” Majumdar said.This virus is causing cluster infections not only in hospitals or offices but also in closed environments of homes and within extended families. “Due to the high transmissibility, entire families are getting the infection with the virus within a very short period. Much before the first infected person starts showing symptoms, the virus is passing on to the rest in the family,” said critical care specialist Dipanjan Chatterjee of Medica Hospital. The virus this time has turned out to be highly contagious, though a large number of asymptomatic cases are being reported. These asymptomatic people might were more likely to spread the virus to others unknowingly, experts said. “In addition to causing mostly mild infections, people are becoming free of symptoms in just about three to four days. There’s no need to panic in case an entire family gets infected. But at the same time, see to it that the elderly and those with co-morbidities get the right attention,” said infectious diseases control specialist Deb Kishore Gupta.Naktala resident Sayantani Chatterjee, along her two-year-old son, had visited her parents’ residence at Thakurpukur a day before Christmas. Her husband and her parents-in-law joined them on December 30. On the night of January 1, Sayantani’s father-in-law started showing initial symptoms of Covid, followed by her sister-in-law’s son. Thereafter, in the next few hours, nine members of the family fell ill. Tests confirmed that they were all Covid positive. “Family members, who step out of homes, should strictly adhere to Covid-appropriate measures, such as masking, sanitization and maintain distance as much as possible so that they don’t bring the infection home,” said Asis Manna, MSVP at Infectious Diseases & Beliaghata General Hospital.Unlike last time, when children in the family mostly remained untouched by the virus, are also contracting the virus in large numbers. “I have come across a good number of children, along with other family members, infected in the past few days. This was not the case last year. The festive revelries, with no regard to Covid-appropriate behaviour, has led to this,” said Prabhas Prasun Giri, associate professor of paediatrics at Institute of Child Health.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/entire-families-getting-cov-positive-this-time/articleshow/88721759.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The couple have a two-year-old son. ASI Choudhary said that Sana told police that frequent disputes took place between her and Faizan over petty issues. So, three months back she along with her son shifted to her parents’ home in Gautam Nagar. She told police that on Tuesday afternoon she was sitting outside the house with her mother. Around 2pm, Faizan reached the spot and tried to take her son with him. When she protested the accused told her that he was his son too and nobody could stop him from taking him. A dispute erupted between them after which Faizan took out a knife and stabbed her in the abdomen and her hand. Her brother and sister-in-law along with neighbours intervened and rescued her from his clutches. They rushed her to hospital while Faizan fled the spot.

---||Bhopal||Brace for power shock, MP discoms seek 10% hike in tariff this year||BHOPAL: In a state that has one of the highest electricity tariff in the country, the power distribution companies (discoms) are out to burden the consumers again as they have sought a 10% hike in domestic power tariff from the regulator. Discoms have submitted their annual revenue requirement before the Madhya Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (MPERC) and urged the commission to increase the power tariff for the financial year to bridge their expected revenue gap of Rs 3,915 crore. Revenue gap is the difference between estimated earning from sale of power and estimated expenses incurred for supplying that power to the consumers. The distribution companies want the tariff to be revised with effect from April1, 2022. Overall, around 8.7% tariff hike is sought by the discoms for raising Rs 3,915 crore and meeting their estimated revenue requirement of Rs 48,873 crore. However, this proposed hike is different for different sectors, for domestic consumers it has sought a hike of around 10%, then for agricultural consumers, it has sought a hike of 10.61%, for public water works and street lights it has sought a hike of 10.61%. And in time when businesses are still to come out of the impact of Covid-19 pandemic, a power tariff hike of 13.38% is sought for power intensive industries. However, MPERC has sought suggestions and objections from stakeholders over the ARR of discoms and also scheduled public hearings on February 8, 9, and 10 at Jabalpur, Indore and Bhopal respectively. It is only after going through the suggestions of stake holders, that the commission will decide upon the petition, said sources. Experts claim that there are several paradoxes in the ARR submitted by discoms. “Like on one hand the discoms have cited surplus power as one of the major financial burdens as there is a surplus of around 25,689 million units, instead of encouraging consumption to mitigate the losses, discoms have tried to discourage power consumption by urging the commission for the first time, in this tariff revision, to allow them for recovering 30% additional charge from the consumers who have used power more than that was sanctioned for their connection. It will negatively affect both the consumers as well as the discoms,” retired additional chief engineer of MP Genco, Rajendra Agarwal told TOI.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/brace-for-power-shock-mp-discoms-seek-10-hike-in-tariff-this-year/articleshow/88721791.cms||Amarjeet Singh

About the exhibit displayed in the exhibition Dr. Ashok Kumar Sharma, said, “Parraiya-Dhol is one of the ancient musical instruments of the tribes living in Bastar district of Chhattisgarh. Without the sound of this instrument, all the events of the tribal culture of this area are considered incomplete.” Parraya is a cylindrical drum used by the Muria and Madia tribe. This is one of the favourite instrument of Muria Chelik (Youth).

Over 1,500 cases have come in the last seven days, 1,123 of them in the last three days alone. Indore accounts for nearly 55% of the week’s count. To add to this, Indore reported a whopping 512 cases in Wednesday night’s bulletin. In just four days, the district has added 1,078 cases. The surge is building up in alarming manner — the daily count crossed 200 on Monday, 300 on Tuesday and shot up to 594 on Wednesday. This is the first time in seven months that daily numbers crossed 500 (the last time was June 8, 2021, when 535 people tested positive). Active cases have risen five-fold in a week — from 360 on December 30 to 1,544 on January 5. The week-on-week progression of Covid-19 graph clearly suggests that Madhya Pradesh is in the grip of the third wave. The curve is identical to the early days of the second peak, but the numbers are less this time, probably due to increased vaccination. Indore and Bhopal are again topping the charts. Indore alone reported 512 new cases — more than half of the state’s count on Wednesday. Bhopal reported 92 new cases, a seven-month high. Gwalior was third with 58 new infections, followed by Jabalpur (23) and Ujjain (22). New caseswere reported by 27 districts — over half the state. Another death was added to the toll, taking it to 10,535. It was the seventh death in a month. The positivity rate climbed to 0.99% on Wednesday. It was a mere 0.01% a month ago. What’s also worrying is that testing is still low. On Wednesday, 59,525 tests were conducted, which is close to the December average.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/indore/mp-cases-double-in-24-hrs-indore-hit-by-512-in-a-day/articleshow/88723368.cms||---

Mohan Bhagwatji, not a single statement has come from you on these Godse supporters,” Singh tweeted.On the same day, state Congress media cell chief Jitu Patwari remarked at a press conference that BJP-RSS are the “descendants of Ravana” who are trying to kill the ideology of the Mahatma in the name of Lord Rama. “Mahatma Gandhi’s assassination was not the killing of a person but the assassination of an ideology. In 70 years, the entire world accepted that ideology. Not a single country remains untouched by the Mahatma’s principles. Not a single great man of the world remains untouched by that philosophy,” Patwari, a former minister, said.Reacting to Congress’ allegations, state BJP secretary Rajneesh Agarwal said, “Digvijaya Singh repeatedly takes the name of RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat with the sole intention of brightening his political career. Mahatma Gandhi and his principles were always accepted by RSS. It is the Congress that takes the name of Godse more than it mentions Mahatma Gandhi. Their entire politics is now based on mentioning Godse. In practice, Congress followed Nehru and not Mahatma Gandhi.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/why-is-rss-chief-silent-on-godse-supporters-diggy/articleshow/88721801.cms||---

And why did home minister Narottam Mishra rush to meet Bhargava at his residence on Tuesday? Both are senior ministers of the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government but home minister Narottam Mishra is known to be close to Union home minister Amit Shah. Mishra makes regular trips to Delhi but on Sunday, his visit to the capital was apparently scheduled all of a sudden. There were reports that he met some central leaders . When home minister Mishra travels to Delhi, it usually triggers another round of political speculation, and this was no different. Gopal Bhargava was in Jabalpur on Monday to review the Corona preparations when the media there asked him about Narottam Mishra’s visit to New Delhi. Bhargava replied sharply, “There are leaders who go to Delhi. Instead, it would be better if we reached the schemes meant for the people to them and stressed on development.” Bhargava said he is a senior MLA of the party and a minister. “I have never been Dilliwadi and don’t depend on tours to Delhi,” Bhargava said, adding that BJP is a disciplined party and there is “no need for recommendations or lobbying”. On Tuesday, Mishra went to meet Bhargava at his residence here. They looked jovial and had a closed-door discussion. The media was told it was an official meeting.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/much-ado-over-a-delhi-trip-ministers-dilli-wadi-dig/articleshow/88721802.cms||Suchandana Gupta

A division bench comprising Chief Justice S Manikumar and Justice Shaji P Chaly made the observation while issuing notice to the university’s registrar and board members on an appeal against a single bench’s judgment declining the challenge against the reconstitution of Board of Studies. The appeal was filed by Vijayakumar V and Shino P Jose, who are members of the academic council of management studies at the university. During the admission hearing on the appeal, it was argued on behalf of the appellants that the notification reconstituting the Board of Studies is illegal. Many of the board members were not teachers and are corporate heads, the appellants have alleged while also arguing that teachers of self-financing colleges have also been included in the board. Only the chancellor has the power to nominate the chairman and members of the board and the syndicate lacked the power to do so, the appellants have contended. The court will hear the case again on January 17.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/board-of-studies-reconstitution-prima-facie-incorrect-says-hc/articleshow/88719694.cms||---

---||India||Government for early counselling for PG med courses as SC starts EWS quota hearing||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday commenced hearing on petitions challenging the 27% OBC and 10% EWS (reservations for poor among forwards) quotas in admissions to PG medical courses and asked the petitioners and the Centre to conclude by Thursday arguments on the urgent issue - the resolution of which will permit counselling for postgraduate medical seats for 2021-22 academic session with or without the new quotas. While the EWS quota for jobs and admissions to government educational institutions was notified in January, 2019, the 27% OBC quota in medical admissions (all-India quota) was notified in July last year much after the medical PG examination schedule was announced. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta was told by a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and A S Bopanna that, "Now that you have revisited the criteria and filed an affidavit annexing the report of the committee, the petitioners' counsel can give their arguments on the issue. We will hear them and then hear the government on Thursday." The SG said, "Now, there is a judicial adjudication on the OBC quota in medical admissions. We, as government, would earnestly request the SC that we would not create a situation where the OBC and the poorest of the general category are deprived of what is legitimately due to them." Mehta said the petitions against 10% EWS quota were filed last year though it was notified in January 2019. This has been implemented pan-India for employment and admissions for two years. We are at a stage where the counselling is stuck, from graduation to post-graduation courses. The resident doctors have concerns and we feel their concerns are genuine." Referring to a resurgence of the Covid pandemic and possible shortage of doctors due to non-completion of counselling, the SG said, "We are facing a different type of situation. The society cannot afford to go into reservation policy and lengthy arguments over the issue right now." "But it is for the court to see whether the committee report, and the acceptance of the recommendations are in broad conformity with the string of rulings by the SC. I will be able to satisfy the court that the EWS criteria is not over-inclusive. So, let the counselling proceed and then the SC can examine the issue in detail." Senior advocate Shyam Divan said the counselling should be resumed without OBC quota as it was notified in July, months after the examination schedule was announced in February last year. "It is against all canons of law to change the rules after the game has begun," he said. Divan said the SC has consistently ruled that reservation quantum should not exceed 50% at any cost but the addition of 37% quota for OBC and EWS category together has pushed the existing reservation of 22% for SC and ST much beyond the limit fixed by the court in a string of judgments.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-for-early-counselling-for-pg-med-courses-as-sc-starts-ews-quota-hearing/articleshow/88721814.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

A meeting of the front here on Wednesday decided to strengthen its agitation against the project. “The UDF will not allow the government to go ahead with the alignment works or land acquisition,” UDF convener M M Hassan told reporters after the meeting. "We will approach the government and assembly speaker with a demand to convene an assembly session.” The UDF will launch the agitation in all districts through which the SilverLine passes. It has been decided to have four permanent agitation venues in districts that will be worst affected by land acquisition — Kollam, Kottayam, Kozhikode and Kannur, Hassan said. He said the UDF will also convene three regional sessions in Thiruvananthapuram, Ernakulam and Kozhikode — like the chief minister — to interact with people. The front will parade those losing their properties in these sessions, named Janakeeya Sadassu. Besides, 100 protest meetings will be organized in areas where land is being acquired. Those affected by land acquisition will lead these meetings. Hassan said the UDF will, unlike the CM, talk to common people. “The CM's first interaction with a section of people itself showed that it was a PR exercise. Only those supporting him were allowed to speak. Keralites understand such gimmicks,” he said. A leaflet detailing the drawbacks of the project — to be distributed among households — was also released at the meeting.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/convene-assembly-session-to-discuss-silverline-project-udf/articleshow/88721817.cms||---

Even though the chief minister has the legal right to further extend the suspension period, he did not do so to protect his most trusted officer.“This has been done even before the court acquitted him of charges levelled against him in the gold smuggling case. This signals the unholy nexus the chief minister has with the accused in the gold smuggling case. Sivasankar is still the accused in the cases registered by customs and ED. The chief minister should not have reinstated him back in service,” said Chennithala.The government is giving a message that the people involved in the gold smuggling case are well protected, and now the government will reinstate another accused Swapna Suresh also into service, he alleged. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/cm-wants-to-protect-sivasankar-chennithala/articleshow/88721819.cms||---

The government on Wednesday hurriedly issued the order constituting the committee consisting of chief secretary VP Joy, additional chief secretary (home and vigilance) TK Jose and principal secretary (general administration) KR Jyothilal. The order, however, has several grave mistakes, including categorizing Lakshman as an Indian Forest Service (IFS) officer and informing the Union ministry of environment, forests and climate changes about the decision to review his suspension. While the MoEF and climate change is the cadre controlling authority of IFS officers, the order should have been marked to the ministry of home affairs which is the cadre-controlling authority of IPS officers.The government suspended him from service on November 10 last year, after state police chief Anil Kant’s recommendation to initiate disciplinary action against Lakshman on the basis of the crime branch report that he helped Mavunkal out of the way in his illegal activities. The crime branch had prepared a report against Lakshman on the basis of scientific evidence, including call records and chat messages between Monson and Lakshman.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/government-to-review-lakshmans-suspension/articleshow/88721820.cms||---

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Once hailed as saviours, now left on the streets||Thiruvananthapuram: During the height of Covid pandemic Sreekuttan S left his job at Technopark to help people affected by the virus. He joined the Covid brigade team as a volunteer. However, he was later sent away from the Covid brigade and did not even receive payment for six months. There are a total of 22,000 such volunteers across Kerala who aided the state during the crisis. These volunteers were the ones who forgot all their personal matters in order to serve the people during the pandemic.Now, the volunteers who got dismissed from Covid brigade are on a day-night strike in front of the Secretariat. The volunteers from almost every district from Kerala are participating in the protest. They have been on strike since Tuesday and said that they will continue till they get justice. The needs they put forward are the complete payment of their incentives and to grant them a government job.The volunteers said that they should be given priorities in government public health sectors. Even though the authorities informed them that the incentives of three months will be paid soon, the protestors are not happy with this decision as the incentives are pending for the past six months and more. “When the pandemic reached its peak stage, the prominent personalities, including the chief minister, used to praise us during news conferences. Now, they dismissed us for futile reasons. Almost all volunteers in this team are from financially backward families and this job is an essential survival option for us. There are also people like me who quit their job in order to help our state. We have submitted petitions to all the respected authorities, including the health minister. Since there are no results, we are on a strike. If the government again fails to give us justice, we will surely go on a hunger strike. The government is not concerned about the livelihood of people from financially backward houses. If the government had paid some attention, we would not have lost the life of our dear colleague Jince, who killed himself due to financial issues,”said Sreekuttan S, a resident of Thiruvananthapuram.The situation of 48-year-old Viji Murugan is no different. She is expecting the incentives to be paid together as she needs the money to repay the loan immediately. She is the only earning individual at her home as her husband is a heart patient and son is a kidney patient.“We have worked continuously for two shifts wearing PPE kits. It was really taxing and there were instances when some of the patients would be rude to us. We have worked in situations where even government officials have been intimidated,”said Viji Murugan, a resident of Kachani.Recalling the apathy she and her family had to face during the period, Sujakumari P, a resident of Kattakada said: “During my working time, people including my neighbours and relatives isolated me and my family. They said I am walking around with Corona. One day, everyone in my family tested positive for Covid, including my aged mother. It was the panchayat that provided us food. No one else has helped us. We had so many bitter experiences like this and now this is the way the government treats us.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/once-hailed-as-saviours-now-left-on-the-streets/articleshow/88721823.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Corp turns its back on fire & electrical clearance order||Thiruvananthapuram: While the huge pile of waste in scrap shops are becoming potential sources of fire hazard, the civic body may as well be the guilty party when it comes to ensuring proper fire safety measures in resource recovery centres and material recovery facilities. Local self-government department, in two different orders issued in 2021, specifically stressed the need for a fire safety audit and the need to obtain ´no objection certificate´ (NoC) from the fire safety department and mandatory clearance from electrical inspectorate. Till date, no proposal ever found mention in the council agendas presented after the orders were issued. Even the health team had reported minor instances of fire outbreak in material recovery facilities like the one at Chackai.The civic body has 64 materials recovery facilities (MRFs) and three reuse & recycling centres (RRCs) at Manacaud, Muttathara and Vattiyoorkavu. The health wing had forwarded a note regarding fire safety measures in MRFs to the engineering wing; however no step was further taken.A major challenge before the city corporation is to clear the huge backlog of waste being piled up in recovery facilities of the city corporation. Delay in clearance of bills of collection contractors on the part of administration had resulted in waste being stacked up in all the material facilities. Although the zone based collection system was approved by the council in 2021, no step has so far been taken to organise periodic collection drives and clear the waste accordingly.The local self-government department had stressed the need to avoid piles up of materials in recovery facilities. LSG in its set of directions summarised the present state of functioning of material recovery facilities. Many facilities function in temporary buildings, in the middle of towns with high population density and in places where no kind of safety audit has been conducted. Besides, fire safety measures were never followed in any of the recovery facilities.The materials being collected are of highly combustible type and the place is vulnerable to fire outbreak. In case of a fire outbreak, there is no provision to douse the fire and to keep the employees safe. First aid facilities have also not been installed in recovery facilities. Even the machines like shredders, baling machines, and dust removers, plastic melting and grinding equipment are placed close to the materials. Burning of dry leaves and electricity short circuit are two potential threats of causing fire in material recovery facilities, LSG notes.Three of the corporation’s RRCs are in permanent structures which reinforce the need for a fire safety system and safety audit. As per the directive, the civic body will have to install a water tank with a capacity of 250-500 litres at recovery facilities. LSG order said that in addition to this fire and rescue services will give training to the staff and collection team. The civic body will also have to take into account; fire safety measures before giving approval for private material recovery facilities. The order also focused on installation of fire extinguishers in recovery facilities. High quality wiring was another aspect which has to be taken care of in recovery facilities. However, the civic body is learnt to have not taken any action towards obtaining a NoC from the fire safety department.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/corp-turns-its-back-on-fire-electrical-clearance-order/articleshow/88721824.cms||Aswin J Kumar

She said that just before the incident, a group of persons had asked if she was the Bindu Ammini who had gone to Sabarimala temple and had made fun of her. She said that the attacker pushed her from the footpath and her head hit a concrete slab. A person who was standing nearby shot the visuals of the attack on the mobile phone. Ammini shared the visuals of the attack on social media. Ammini alleged that the person who attacked her was a Sangh Parivar activist. Ammini was one of the two women who entered Sabarimala temple after the Supreme Court issued a verdict in 2018 ending the ban that prevented the entry of women of menstrual age into the temple. She had come under attack in 2019 at Kochi when a person used pepper spray on her. Police had later arrested Sreenath Padmanabhan (28), a native of Taliparamba in Kannur, who was reportedly an activist of Antarrashtriya Hindu Parishad.

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: CBI finds booze in Electrotherm MD’s home||AHMEDABAD: A CBI search of the Bodakdev home of Shailesh Bhandari, the MD of Electrotherm (India), has yielded 41 liquor bottles worth Rs 2 lakh and a bunch of demonetized currency notes. The agency carried out the search operation on Tuesday night in connection with a case of Rs 632 crore bank fraud. According to the CBI officers involved, the agency has charged the Electrotherm MD with causing a loss to Bank of India. “Bhandari availed of funds and non-fund credit facilities aggregating to Rs 703.89 crore from Bank of India in 2011,” said a CBI officer. “The company started facing liquidity problems from April 2011 and failed to pay its dues despite the restructuring of its account.” The officer said the account was classified as a non-performing asset (NPA) in December 2012. According to CBI officers, a forensic analysis of the transactions of Bhandari’s company has revealed various irregularities, including the diversion and siphoning off of funds through subsidiary and associate companies that had common directors. The CBI officers said that the company also engaged in transactions with suspicious dealers who were involved in issuing bills without the delivery of any goods. A CBI officer said, “During the search in Shailesh Bhandari’s house on Bopal-Ambli Road, 41 Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL) bottles worth Rs 2 lakh were found.” The officer added: “We also found demonetized currency notes — 31 of the Rs 1,000 denomination and 83 of the Rs 500 denomination.” The officer said Vastrapur police was informed about the liquor and currency notes and an FIR was registered on Wednesday. Inspector S G Khambhla of Vastrapur police said that Bhandari and his son Suraj were booked under the Prohibition Act and later released on bail. This is the second instance of liquor bottles being found on Bhandari-owned premises. In February 2021, after he was arrested in a fake billing scam, the state goods and services tax department found eight live cartridges at his office in Palodia village. At the time, Santej police had recovered 898 bottles of imported liquor worth Rs 33 lakh, packed in boxes branded with the company’s logo.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/cbi-finds-booze-in-electrotherm-mds-home/articleshow/88721836.cms||---

Cops believe that the lift had not been maintained properly, causing the cable to snap and the carriage to plunge down when the couple — Rakesh Rajput, 45, and his wife Seema, 40, — got on. The incident took place when the couple were leaving for a shopping trip. “Witnesses said that the couple got onto the lift and pressed the button for the ground floor. Initially, the lift barely moved and then suddenly dropped to the ground floor. The injured couple were rushed to LG hospital in two ambulances,” said police. Vatva inspector H V Sisara said, “Primary information reveals that the incident occurred because the cable snapped.” He said the cops were at the LG hospital to take the complaint. The couple lived with their daughters, one of whom was 22 years old and the other 15 years old. Rajput owns a disposable item shop in the area. Social worker Harshad Patel said, “This is the second incident in the area. On December 24, a youth died during treatment after the lift he was in fell from the second floor of Sharnam IV apartment in Khokhra. These flats were constructed in the last five years.” These incidents in relatively new buildings have once again raised questions regarding lift inspection. Cops said, prima facie, it appears that the lift was not maintained properly. As per the guidelines, every lift has to be inspected once a year. However, in several residential colonies, it has been observed that lifts and elevators are not maintained properly. The mandatory inspection by the lift inspector once a year is also not carried.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/elevator-failure-leaves-vatva-couple-severely-injured/articleshow/88721839.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat pathologist on ‘adopt a parent’ mission||AHMEDABAD: When someone mentions adoption, one automatically thinks of children. So when a social media advertisement “seeking to adopt parents” went viral over the past month, it grabbed attention. Put forth by Dilip Amlani, a 55-year-old pathologist who hails from Jamnagar, the advertisement has led to 800 elderly citizens being part of a caring community that enables them to lead a dignified life. For Amlani, who shunts between Jamnagar and Mumbai where he has three hospitals, this initiative was just an expansion of what he has been doing for some years now. Thanks to his efforts, around 2,000 senior citizens have found shelter in various old-age homes in Gujarat. He has also set up a centre that accommodates nearly 100 elderly couples in Kandivali, Mumbai. The idea to help senior citizens, especially those who were unwell, came to Amlani three years ago. “I never had kids of my own. I had planned to adopt a child but I got busy with my work and time passed. A few years ago, it struck me that while everyone adopts kids, no one ever thought of the elders who also needed our love and care,” said the 55-year-old. “We decided to do something for senior citizens who had age-related diseases, were unable to walk, or wet themselves at night. We circulated a message in internal groups seeking help to start a centre for such elders. Various people offered donations and we set up our first centre in Kandivali,” he added. Such was its success that Amlani began getting calls from Saurashtra and other places to start a similar facility in Gujarat. “As I did not have any infrastructure facility in Gujarat, I contacted various old-age homes, ensured financial aid and volunteer support if they took in elders. This way, we accommodated around 1,200 senior citizens in the state over the past couple of months,” said Amlani. A desire to accelerate his attempts led to the social media advertisement, declaring “Maa Baap Joiye Chhe (Need Parents)”. “I was flooded with calls from people asking me to take in their elderly parents. We began admitting senior citizens who were unwell and have kids who were finding it difficult to take care of them. This way, the children could visit their parents often and the elders would get the help they needed,” he said.

Of these, 5,093 or 50% of cases, were from Ahmedabad city alone. In the 24 hours ending 5pm on Wednesday, the city added 1,637 new cases, the highest number in 232 days or nearly eight months. Compared to Tuesday, new cases rose by 27%. With the discharge of 52 patients, the number of active cases climbed to 5,710 in the city, more than half of the state’s 10,994 active cases. Hospitalization levels, however, have remained low, said city-based experts. The city has 110-odd patients in at government-run and private hospitals, which represent about 2% of active patients. Experts cautioned against any laxity in following Covid protocols. Dr Manoj Singh, a city-based pulmonologist, said that the government should strictly enforce Covid safety protocols at public places, such as the use of masks and physical distancing. “People should also take hand hygiene seriously and cut out unnecessary travel, at least for the next few days, to break the chain of infection,” he said. “I urge citizens to isolate themselves and get tested for Covid-19 even if they have the mildest symptoms of the infection.” Dr Bharat Gadhvi, president of Ahmedabad Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (AHNA), said that they urge that Covid protocols be followed more stringently at workplaces and that people be allowed to work from home if they show any symptoms associated with the virus. The test positivity rate (TPR) has remained over 10% for the district (including the city) for the past two days. On Tuesday, the district found 1,314 cases from 11,999 tests – a TPR of 10.9%. In comparison, the state’s TPR was 3.1%.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/city-accounts-for-half-of-states-new-cases-this-week/articleshow/88721841.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: PIL seeks cancellation of Riverfront flower show||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court has been moved against the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation’s (AMC) plan to organise Flower Show 2022 from January 8 on account of the surge in Covid-19 cases and spread of Omicron variant. A PIL has been filed by Rajshri Kesari, a municipal councillor from Chandkheda ward. She has demanded cancellation of the 15-day annual event to be organised at the riverfront between Ellis Bridge and Sardar Bridge. She has urged the high court to quash the resolutions passed by AMC’s recreational, cultural and heritage committee and the standing committee in December for the organisation of the flower show. The petitioner has stated that the event is to take place at the event centre and the flower park of the riverfront. She contended that this is an unnecessary event when Covid cases are on the rise. She said if the flower show is organized, it can be dangerous for the public as it may result in further transmission of coronavirus, especially its Omicron variant that spreads fast. Kesari stated that it is not clear whether the authorities would allow entry of vaccinated people only or let unvaccinated enter as well. Even if people with one dose of vaccine are allowed, there’s a higher risk of getting infected. “Therefore, it is very hazardous to organise Flower Show 2022 where public will gather in huge numbers,” the petition read. The councillor stated that the flower show would be held for 11 hours a day, and 4,400 persons would be granted entry in a single day. Moreover, canteens, food courts would also be allowed at this event, and there is likelihood of breach of all Covid protocols like social distancing and wearing of masks. The HC is likely to hear the PIL in near future.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/pil-seeks-cancellation-of-riverfront-flower-show/articleshow/88721846.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Invariant corona concerns: To be or knot to be||AHMEDABAD/VADODARA: Ahmedabad-based architect Jay Desai is set to tie the knot on January 24. But given the spike in Covid-19 cases and growing uncertainty around the situation, Desai is compelled to rethink whether to go ahead with the ceremony and if so, how many guests to invite. “So far there are no guidelines on gatherings from the government but given the rise in cases, I am not quite sure how to go about it. We will wait till January 15 and then take a call,” said Desai. Vadodara-based Nilesh Patel is also concerned about his daughter’s wedding in January-end. “Apart from the guest list, I am worried about my daughter’s arrival to India. Since she is coming from the US, she may need to isolate. Besides, we also keep hearing about people testing Covid negative before boarding a flight and positive on landing in India. This worries us all the more. We will decide on the guest list once the government issues the guidelines,” said Patel. Similar is the case with Ibrahim Shaikh, whose daughter is set to wed next week. “We were planning to invite more guests for the reception but are now thinking of keeping it a low-key affair and downsizing the guest list depending on the government guidelines,” said Shaikh. With Covid cases surging by the day across Gujarat, a number of weddings, corporate events, exhibitions as well as social gatherings are getting cancelled or deferred or downsized. Narendra Somani, president, Hotels and Restaurants’ Association (HRA) – Gujarat, said, “I have received at least 10 cancellations for weddings and other social gatherings. People are rethinking their decisions in the wake of the fresh surge in cases. Some of them have deferred all the fringe events and kept it limited to the wedding ceremony with barely 50-100 people considering the safety of the family members and others.” Meanwhile, those keen on destination weddings too have been putting the plans on hold. “A destination wedding planned in Goa on January 14-15 has been postponed after the parents of the bride tested positive. Those planning destination weddings are considering postponing the event,” said Nirav Chahwala, president of South Gujarat Event Management Association, Surat. “At least 30% events – typically those scheduled in January-end and February are being called off in the wake of rising cases. While some have already deferred their events, some others are still waiting for the state government’s guidelines,” said Pintoo Dandwala, owner of a city-based event management company. Several exhibitions as well as corporate events too have been postponed in the wake of fresh surge in cases of coronavirus infections. Neha Sheth, founder of city-based fashion and lifestyle e-commerce portal, decided against going ahead with an exhibition scheduled for next week. “We were to hold an exhibition of our products in fashion and lifestyle segments on January 11 and 12. However, after looking at the increase in the cases over the past week, we thought it best to avoid gatherings. Moreover, we had invited designers from across the country and if people do not turn up, it does not serve the purpose anyway. So, we called off the event,” Sheth said.

On tourists between 15-18 years, Kale said this category of tourists will be allowed as the drive to vaccinate this age group has started from January 3. Another restriction includes 15 feet distance between two safari vehicles. However, stakeholders said this condition will never be followed when a tiger is sighted. Similarly, the condition that six members in one vehicle will be allowed only if they hail from one family, otherwise only four persons will be allowed in one safari vehicle. “It is difficult to identify,” they said. The guidelines also state that along with face masks, tourists will have to carry sanitizer bottles. A fine of Rs1,000 will be imposed if a tourist is found without a face mask.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/only-vaccinated-tourists-to-get-entry-in-tadoba/articleshow/88719716.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Lucknow||Yogi, Dy CMs, UP chief in BJP poll panel||Lucknow: Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, deputy CMs Keshav Maurya and Dinesh Sharma, UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh and state general secretary (organization) Sunil Bansal were the key leaders in the 19-member state election committee which was announced by the party on Wednesday. While inclusion of Yogi is seen as yet another endorsement of his leadership under which the BJP plans to take on the opposition in the upcoming state elections, Keshav Maurya’s inclusion is believed to be a step to send a larger message to the MBC community which plays a crucial role in elections. The BJP has attempted to strike a caste and regional balance in the panel by including prominent leaders who represent different regions of the state. The party has given a fresh traction to its strategy to woo Dalits by including former Uttarakhand governor and party national vice-president Baby Rani Maurya who happens to be a Jatav, a Dalit sub-caste to which BSP chief Mayawati belongs. Likewise, Agra MP and Union minister of state for law SP Singh Baghel and Kaushambi MP Vinod Sonkar have also been included in the panel. The party has also given adequate representation to the leaders from the Brahmin community, which has traditionally been voting for the party. Besides Dinesh Sharma, the committee also includes former UP BJP chief and Deoria MP Ramapati Ram Tripathi, and UP law minister Brajesh Pathak. Other prominent members include Union state minister Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti and Etah MP Rajveer Singh. Jyoti represents Nishad community which is being aggressively wooed by the BJP to consolidate its position in east UP. Rajveer Singh is the son of late CM Kalyan Singh. His inclusion in the state election committee is also perceived as BJP’s attempt to escalate its foot prints in the Lodh community among the OBC, especially in the west UP region. Similarly, Sanjiv Baliyan, BJP MP from Muzaffarnagar and junior minister in the minister of water resources, river development and Ganga rejuvenation, also figures in the state election committee. A Jat, Baliyan could wheel in necessary ground level feedback vis-a-vis west UP which came under influence of the raging farmer protest against the three farm laws, which were eventually repealed by the Centre last year. BJP MLC and state general secretary Ashwini Tyagi, who has been keeping tabs on west UP politics, has also found a place in the committee. BJP national vice-president and UP in charge Radha Mohan Singh, joint in charge Sanjeev Chaurasiya, Sunil Ojha and Y Satya Kumar have been included as the special invitee. President of UP BJP women wing Geeta Shakya is the ex officio member of the committee.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/yogi-dy-cms-up-chief-in-bjp-poll-panel/articleshow/88721024.cms||---

Two days before the lockdown was imposed on March 24, 2020, the civic authorities had closed public transport services. In September 2020, after when the Covid situation eased, AMTS, BRTS services resumed at 50% capacity. They were then halted on March 18, 2021, when the second wave of cases had peaked. Services were resumed at half capacity on June 7, 2021, when the number of cases reduced. In October 2021, authorities started operating public buses at full seating capacity. “Only passengers who have taken both doses of the Covid vaccine will be allowed to use our bus services,” Barot said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/amts-brts-loads-halved-from-today/articleshow/88721849.cms||---
---||Delhi||Why raising seating capacity to 100% won’t help Delhi Metro much||NEW DELHI: Delhi Disaster Management Authority’s (DDMA) order allowing Delhi Metro trains and public transport buses to operate with 100% seating capacity has brought some relief to commuters, but the queues to enter stations are still present, albeit shorter than earlier. Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) had also decided to run trains at a much lower frequency on weekends with the weekend curfew imposed by DDMA. After the DDMA meeting, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said that the decision was taken to control crowding and prevent Metro stations and bus stops from becoming super-spreaders of Covid-19. Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications) DMRC, said according to the latest DDMA guidelines, curfew had been imposed on January 8 and 9. During this period, Metro services would be available at a reduced frequency. He added that trains would be available at a frequency of 15 minutes on Yellow Line (HUDA City Centre-Samaypur Badli) and Blue Line (Dwarka Sec-21-Noida Electronic City/Vaishali). “On all other lines, trains will be available at a frequency of 20 minutes during the weekend curfew,” said Dayal. “On weekdays, Metro services will continue to remain available as usual. This is to reiterate that according to the latest guidelines, though 100% sitting is allowed in Metro trains, no standing is allowed. Entry to the trains and stations will continue to remain highly restrictive as only up to 50 passengers per coach are allowed,” Dayal said. The official advised people to travel only if absolutely essential and also keep extra time in hand as entry would continue to be regulated to ensure compliance with the guidelines. This may result in long queues or waiting outside stations. While up to 25 passengers per coach could be accommodated when 50% seating and no standing passengers were allowed, the number would now go up to 50. Unlike buses, Metro trains are meant for mass transit and designed for a large number of standing passengers. With the current guidelines, an eight-coach train’s carrying capacity would go up from 200 to 400, even though up to 1,000 passengers could be carried if passengers were allowed to stand with social distancing in place, sources said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/why-raising-seating-capacity-to-100-wont-help-metro-much/articleshow/88721027.cms||---
---||Delhi||Why you can’t shrug off Omicron as common cold||NEW DELHI: Infection by the Covid variant Omicron is not the common cold. While some reports show a reduced risk of hospitalisation when infected by Omicron compared with Delta, there still are far too many people in hospital to be complacent about the latest coronavirus variant. World Health Organization’s technical lead on Covid-19, Maria Van Kerkhove, reiterated the seriousness of the variant in a recent tweet. Her views are finding resonance among doctors involved in Covid management and actual patients. “It is not as mild as people say it is. I have had a high fever for the last three days and it is not subsiding despite medication. I also feel extreme weakness,” said Mayur Vihar resident Ranjana Sharma. Dr Rajesh Chawla, senior consultant pulmonologist, Apollo Hospitals, said Omicron might have a lower mortality rate than Delta but was still sending people to hospitals. “I have three patients who require oxygen support. All of them are fully-vaccinated,” he said, warning against complacency and ignorance of Covid-appropriate behaviour. The Omicron variant mostly causes infection in the upper respiratory tract but the doctors say there are also cases of lung damage, especially among elderly people and those with co-morbidities such as diabetes and hypertension. “People should not take Covid-19 lightly at all. The new variant causing the current spate of infections may be milder than the previous variant but it is clear beyond doubt that its transmissibility rate is very high. If too many people get infected at a time, the hospitals will get overwhelmed,” said Dr Neeraj Nischal, additional professor, internal medicine, AIIMS. Live updatesNischal stressed that the governments are doing their best to boost health infrastructure to handle demand for hospitalisation. “But if the cases are too many, such preparations may not help much. People have to take steps themselves to prevent the infection from spreading and thus save lives,” he said. Covid caused by the Omicron variant typically causes symptoms such as cough, sore throat, fever, tiredness, headache and aches and pains. Diarrhoea and runny noses are rare. Unlike the previous wave caused by the Delta variant, there is no loss of smell or taste in a majority of patients this time, reports suggest. The warning signs are difficulty in breathing, dip in oxygen saturation (SpO2<94% on room air), persistent pain/pressure in the chest and persisting or worsening of symptoms beyond four days. Nischal explained that treatment was mostly symptomatic. “For example, if someone has persistent fever, the person can be given paracetamol. For cold, cetirizine can be given. Steroids aren’t advised in patients who are in home isolation,” he said. In the last two years since the pandemic began, many drugs have been repurposed to treat Covid while some new therapies have also come up. However, Nischal pointed out that there was limited evidence that these were efficacious. “In recent times, two key therapies have gained a lot of attention: monoclonal antibodies and the antiviral drug called Molnupiravir. Monoclonal antibodies available in India are not effective against the Omicron variant. Though Molnupiravir helps reduce hospitalisation in a small subset of patients, we also know that the drug has some side-effects. It is not advised for pregnant women and younger children,” the AIIMS doctor said. Even the US FDA advises that Molnupiravir should be used only when the other therapeutic options are not available. It should not be used as pre-exposure or post-exposure prophylaxis, according to doctors. “Drugs getting emergency-use authorisation should not be considered as magic pills,” cautioned another doctor. “We have seen how the indiscriminate use of some such drugs and therapies caused a lot of harm (side-effects) in many patients. We should learn from our mistakes." At present, Delhi has 23,307 active cases. Of them, 782 patients, including some suspected cases, are hospitalised. Of those who are in hospitals, 140 (18%) are on oxygen support, while 22 (3%) others require ventilator support.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/why-you-cant-shrug-off-omicron-as-common-cold/articleshow/88719731.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

Sources confirmed that Bank of Baroda employs 15 people at this branch. “The employees had given their samples for testing after one of them tested positive. Of 14 samples, 10 tested positive, one tested negative and the reports of other three are still to arrive. Since so many employees were out of commission, the branch has been shut,” said a well-placed source. A notice has been put up outside the bank branch, requesting customers to visit a nearby branch for important banking transactions. The Maha Gujarat Bank Employees’ Association (MGBEA) earlier made representations to the state authorities and the State Level Bankers’ Committee (SLBC), to curtail banking hours and reduce staff when cases increase.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/10-test-ve-psb-branch-closed/articleshow/88721850.cms||---

Patel said, “Covid pandemic situation is similar to what we had in March 2021. However, in March, there were 8,318 cases on a particular day, and 50% patients needed hospitalization. “However, on January 4, there were 7,881 cases but only 303 — less than 5% — needed hospitalization. Also, of these, only 57% needed oxygen and only 5 needed ventilators so there is no need to panic.”“The CM is monitoring the situation everyday. The chief secretary also held meetings with key staff and district officers,” Patel said.The minister added, “Due to the major increase in cases, genome sequencing for all samples is not posible. At present, we are getting almost 50:50 ratio of cases of Omicron and Delta variants. We have ordered monitoring at private hospitals as well.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/positivity-high-but-hospitalization-low/articleshow/88721852.cms||---

The management of these schools on Wednesday said that they will shift fully to online classes, sources privy to the development said. The school had earlier decided to switch to online studies only for classes where students tested postive for Covid, but with cases increasing in the city it took this decision, the sources said. On Tuesday, three school student tested positive, according to information shared by the schools with the district education officer (DEO). They included a pair of twins. All the three cases reported are from Udgam School for Children, said sources. In all, 13 children from Udgam contracted Covid-19 in the last three weeks, said sources. Many self-financed schools in the city are considering switching completely to online teaching till the situation returns to normal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/udgam-zebar-go-online/articleshow/88721854.cms||---

According to estimates by the Federation of Gujarat State Chemists and Druggists Association (FGSCDA), sale of Covid medicines have increased 1.5 times between December 27 and January 4 compared to the first fortnight of December. Besides this, masks as well as immunity boosters are also flying off the shelves fast. FGSCDA chairman Alpesh Patel said, “The number of Covid cases are increasing and we are witnessing an upward movement in the sale of Covid-related medicines. These mainly include azithromycin, favipiravir, paracetamol and ivermectin as well. We have received directives from the All India Organisation of Chemists and Druggists to maintain sufficient stock of each of these medicines so that no shortage arises.” At the moment, there is no shortage of these medicines, say chemists and druggists. Medkart co-founder Ankur Aggarwal said, “With Covid cases going up, the sale of medicines has picked up. We are in talks with our distributors and manufacturers to keep the supply chain intact.” The newly launched drug for Covid-19 treatment, molnupiravir, is also available and fresh orders are being placed by chemists for these medicines. Besides medicines, the sale of masks, immunity boosters and preventive medicine have also gone up significantly. “The demand for vitamin C has almost doubled in the past one month. That apart, people are also buying oximeters and thermometers in addition to other preventive medicines as a precautionary measure,” said a chemist in Prahladnagar. Estimates by FGSCDA suggest that some 10 lakh disposable masks, in addition to 6 lakh N95 masks, are being sold daily across the state.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/as-case-numbers-surge-covid-medicine-sales-up-150/articleshow/88721856.cms||Niyati Parikh

---||Ahmedabad||SC rejects state’s appeal against pension||Ahmedabad: The Supreme Court has turned down Gujarat government’s appeal and held that all petitioner lecturers and professors of Gujarat’s universities, who had not opted for pension scheme in favour of contributory provident fund, are eligible for the pension schemes though they had missed the bus 30 years ago. The litigations were initiated after many teaching and non-teaching staff, including lecturers from government and aided colleges, were denied pension scheme benefits as they had opted for a one-time payment by the government at the time of retirement. After ignoring the option given by the state government on a couple of occasions in the 1980s, these employees approached the government at the time of their retirement and requested they be considered for the pension scheme. Besides, in the appointments made after 1982, the government did not offer the option at all. The employees also sought pension benefit after retirement by citing a 1984 government resolution.However, the government rejected their request for pension benefits and the dispute landed in the high court with hundreds of retired college teachers demanding extension of the pension scheme and complaining that the government had not given them the opportunity to exercise the option on grounds of financial implications. The single-judge bench of the HC allowed the petitions in 2016 and ordered the government to grant pension to the petitioners on condition that the petitioners should refund the amount paid to them towards the provident fund.There were four batches of such litigations and all the petitions were allowed. The state government challenged the decisions before the division bench, which rejected its appeals in 2019.One such rejected appeal was carried to the apex court by the state government contending that despite being granted the opportunity on multiple occasions, the petitioners had not opted for the pension scheme. At a belated stage, their request cannot be acceded to, the government argued. The bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and A S Bopanna dismissed the state government’s appeal on December 17, 2021 stating that one of the batches of such petitions allowed by HC had attained finality. There was no difference between the petitioners who succeeded and are drawing pension and the present petitioners. “Consequently, it would be wholly iniquitous to apply a different yardstick to a batch of pensioners who are respondents to these proceedings, when the judgment of the high court has attained finality in respect of a similar batch of pensioners who are governed by the same judgment. They are receiving pensions,” the order read.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/sc-rejects-states-appeal-against-pension/articleshow/88721859.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad home sales grew 37% in 2021||AHMEDABAD: Riding on improved demand and consumer sentiment, Ahmedabad recorded a surge in home sales by 37% in the calendar year 2021. The launches of new housing units also galloped by 99% to touch a six-year high, according to the latest report released by the real estate consultant Knight Frank India. The housing sales in the city rose to 8,911 units from 6,506 units in 2020. The residential market sales remained strong in the second half (July-December) of 2021 with 3,096 units being sold in the October-December period alone. The annual sales, however, are still quite lower than the 16,713 units sold in the pre-pandemic time in 2019, the report added. The new launches of residential units jumped substantially to 14,648 units by the end of 2021 as against 7,372 units coming to the market in the previous year. On the half-yearly basis, the new launches firmed up 77% to touch 8,422 units launched in July-December 2021 from 4,745 in the corresponding period of 2020. North and west remained the largest residential markets accounting for 38% and 30% of sales respectively. Conversely, the east accounted for 3% of sales during the second half of 2021. “The pandemic infused the need for upgrading the family’s primary residence,” said Balbir Singh Khalsa, executive director and branch director, Ahmedabad, at Knight Frank India. He added: “Work and study from home requirements have encouraged home sales in the mid-segment residential category.” He said the trend has been observed across locations. “Ahmedabad is currently the most affordable city among the eight under our review and residential demand is improving,” he said. “Plotted developments and gated bungalow communities are also finding favour with homebuyers.” Apart from improved consumer sentiment, low home-loan interest rates, the need for bigger homes amid the pandemic, and relatively stable prices have supported the demand, said real estate industry players.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/abad-home-sales-grew-37-in-2021/articleshow/88721861.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat HC issues notices over encounter deaths||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Wednesday issued notices to the state government and seven policemen over a PIL filed by a minor girl over the encounter deaths of her father and teenage brother. The plea seeks the registration of an FIR for murder against the cops concerned and a thorough probe by an independent agency. The encounter occurred in Patdi taluka of Surendranagar district on November 6, 2021. The petitioner, Sohana Jat Malek, wants an independent investigation into the killing of her father Hanifkhan Jat Malek, 44, and her brother Madin, 14, by seven policemen in an allegedly fake encounter. Sohana has complained that instead of registering an FIR against the cops involved in the encounter, Bajana police lodged a false FIR against the deceased, their family, and neighbours. She told the court that two of her neighbours who had died long ago were also shown as accused in the FIR registered a day after the encounter. On the other hand, she said, police did not register an FIR against the cops’ party involved in the encounter, a procedure mandated by a Supreme Court order. In her petition, Sohana stated that PSI V N Jadeja along with other policemen arrived at her house in Gediya village at about10pm in a private vehicle. The other cops named in the petition are Rajeshbhai Savajibhai, Shaileshbhai Prahladbhai, Kiritbhai Ganeshbhai, Dignivijaysinh Hardipsinh, Prahladbhai Prabhubhai, and Manubai Govindbhai. Sohana said the cops dragged her father into the vehicle. When her brother Madin questioned the cops, he was allegedly shot point-blank. She said when her father got down from the vehicle to check on his son, he too was shot and killed. Sohana’s counsel Yatin Oza said the fact that 10 cops could not control a teenager and he had to be shot dead is not believable and shows that this was a fake encounter. Police claim that Hanifkhan was an accused in 86 different offences. But the petitioner stated that the registration of many offences against her father “will not give an automatic licence to the cops to carry out a fake encounter”. She further stated that looking at the cold-blooded murders, the neighbours also came out of their houses and some of them were booked for assault. However, she said, the FIR was false because two of the neighbours — Amirkhan Jat Malek and Alubhai Motibhai — had died years earlier. Amirkhan died on January 14, 2012, and Alubhai had died 40 years ago. Both have been shown as attacking the police party on November 6, 2021. Other neighbours booked are septuagenarians and one of them is a disabled person. Besides the registration of an FIR against the police party and an investigation by an agency such as the CBI, Sohana has requested a court-monitored committee to look into the matter.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/court-issues-notices-over-encounter-deaths/articleshow/88721862.cms||---

The flute travels with its carry-on bag of adaptability, exhaling with equal wonder during Hindustani voyages and Carnatic explorations.On Thursday, sitarist Pandit Kushal Das and flautist Shashank Subramanyam will help rasikas contemplate on what Manju Mehta, the Saptak legatee, calls the “aatma” (soul) of ragas.Mehta, a distinguished sitarist, was the disciple of the immortal Pandit Ravi Shankar. “Guruji made many Carnatic ragas famous on the Hindustani stage,” Mehta told TOI. “When you speak of the Hindustani tradition or the Carnatic genre, remember that the aatma of a raga is the same in every instrument.”When the sitar and the flute launch their dialogue, the moderator of intellectual rhythms will be the tabla stalwart, Pandit Kumar Bose. Santoor god Pandit Shivkumar Sharma, sarod divinity Ustad Amjad Ali Khan, and sitar great Ustad Shahid Parvez have turned to Pandit Bose to have a structure set for their flourishes. The ensemble’s mridangam notable will be Dr Patri Satish Kumar.As for the duet, Saptak is known for orchestrating blockbuster alliances. In 2013, the festival put Dhrupad wizards Pandits Ramakant and Umakant Gundecha on stage with the famed Carnatic vocalists Shriramkumar and Ravikumar Malladi. At the end of the performance, young people muttered “awesome” and didn’t restrain tears — usually that reaction is provoked only when they receive the latest generation of cellphone. The cognoscenti froze into silence, letting the tingle stay in their aatmas for as long as possible.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/musical-alliance-raga-is-matchmaker-for-traditions/articleshow/88721865.cms||Kannan Somasundaram

We have made representation to the college authority in this regard,” said a member of JDA. “We have never experienced such an environment where criticism is constant and we are seeing a highly efficient workplace turn into less efficient and it is discouraging and disheartening to see, feel and work,” according to a letter written to the college authority and signed by the ENT department students.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/resident-docs-want-hod-out-till-inquiry-is-over/articleshow/88721866.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Car sales revved up 27% in 2021 despite chip-shortage bump in Gujarat||AHMEDABAD: Supply chain issues in the automobile industry triggered by global semiconductor shortage have failed to dampen the buyer sentiment in Gujarat with car sales witnessing a steady 27% increase in 2021 as compared to 2020. Buoyed by good demand and increasing preference to own a vehicle for personal mobility in the wake of Covid-19 restrictions, car sales witnessed a steady growth last year. According to data provided by Federation of Automobile Dealers’ Association (FADA), car sales surged from 2.04 lakh in 2020 to 2.6 lakh in 2021. The sales however remained marginally less by 5.8% against 2.76 lakh units sold in 2019 before the outbreak of Covid. “The demand for four-wheelers was exceptionally good last year in the wake of increasing preference for personal vehicles. However, due to the ongoing semiconductor shortage, dealers were unable to cash in on the demand in the wake of supply-side constraints. Spending revived relatively well as people did not splurge on travelling or other activities during the pandemic year, which propelled car purchases,” said Pranav Shah, chairman, Gujarat region, FADA. In fact, had these bottlenecks been addressed, the growth would have been certainly better than pre-Covid period, suggested dealers. Even the two-wheeler sales showed a decent 18% growth in 2021 with some 8.2 lakh two-wheelers sold against 6.95 lakh in 2020. However, two-wheeler sales continued to remain muted as compared to pre-pandemic times — the sales declined 28.2% as compared to 11.42 lakh units retailed in 2019. Shah explained that two-wheeler demand dipped mainly due to increased cost of ownership of two-wheelers. “Two-wheeler sales showed a growth in demand but the overall momentum remained low-key as compared to the pre-pandemic period. While two-wheeler prices have increased by 20% on an average, the fuel prices too remained on the higher side, both proving to be deterrents for sales,” he said. Dealers suggested that loan rejection ratio increased as well. “More customers are facing rejections of their auto loan applications as their CIBIL score is weak and their incomes have suffered. Even rural demand is low due to unseasonal rainfall and piling farm debts. Therefore, despite a handsome inventory, sales remained muted,” said an Ahmedabad-based two-wheeler dealer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/car-sales-revved-up-27-in-2021-despite-chip-shortage-bump/articleshow/88721867.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Ahmedabad||Rejected for CAPFs due to kidney stone, Gujarat HC orders review||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court ordered a review medical examination for a candidate seeking the job of constable in the central armed police forces (CAPFs) after he was declared unfit as he had hematuria due to a kidney stone. Bipin Deshmukh of Navsari district, had moved the HC after he was declared medically unfit when his urine report reflected that he had renal calculus. He had applied for a constable’s post in CAPFs such as the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), National Investigation Agency, Assam Rifles etc. Deshmukh’s advocate, Vashishtha Joshi submitted that there was an error in judgment on the part of the medical officer because Deshmukh was found not to have hematuria when he appeared for a second medical test. He also cited the case of another candidate, who was declared fit for the job after the medical authority came to the conclusion that he did not have hematuria after a first report showed him as having the condition. After hearing the case, Justice Nikhil Kariel directed the recruiting authorities to strictly follow the rules for acceptance and rejection of appeals by a candidate, and to forward Deshmukh’s case for a review medical examination to be conducted by the RME board of the CAPFs. The court ordered that he be given an appointment, if he is found otherwise fit by the medical board. As Deshmukh’s request to send his case for review was rejected in July 2021, the high court said that if his certificate shows an error in judgment attributing his hematuria to his kidney stone, the CAPF appellate authority cannot reject his certificate or his appeal on the substantive ground that he is declared unfit on the ground of renal calculus. This is because it was clear in his certificate that the petitioner’s rejection on the ground of hematuria due to renal calculus was an error in judgment. The HC said that the authorities’ decision to not send Deshmukh’s case for review lacked merit and needed to be quashed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/rejected-for-capfs-due-to-kidney-stone-hc-orders-review/articleshow/88721868.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Cost of medicines: Chief justice slams price gouging||AHMEDABAD: The chief justice of the Gujarat high court on Wednesday criticized pharmaceutical companies for price gouging under the ‘shield’ of government agencies such as the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA). During a hearing of a petition filed by Sun Pharma Laboratories Ltd related to the Drug Price Control Order, 2013, Chief Justice Aravind Kumar commented, “The maximum price of an antibiotic is Rs 1.73.” He added: “The NPPA has fixed its price at Rs 300…Unfortunately, I know something of this.” He went on to say: “No drug which is manufactured in India except carcinoma drugs will go beyond Rs 300, but some pharma companies are charging for some drugs up to Rs 7,000 for one tablet.” One of the judgments on the issue of pricing of scheduled drugs and formula of drugs involving Cipla was also discussed during the hearing.  Justice Kumar was one of the judges who heard the case in Karnataka. Talking about the Sun Pharma case, the CJ said that all the issues relate to the NPPA. The cases have been going on for 25-30 years. “Let’s see what can be done unless and until the central government wakes up (to the issue),” the chief justice said. The petitioner’s advocate submitted that the NPPA has the power to fix the retail price of a drug which is part of the schedule under Para 14 of the order. The advocate said the authority also has powers to fix the price of a new drug made from a combination that is part of the schedule. After the division bench issued a notice to the Centre and sought a reply by February 7, the lawyer urged the court to give interim relief in case the authority issues a demand notice to the company. This led the chief justice to comment on price gouging by pharmaceutical companies. In defence, the lawyer tried to argue that the particular case is not related to a scheduled drug. To this, the chief justice remarked, “This is where you take protection and that is where agencies are shielding you.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/cost-of-medicines-chief-justice-slams-price-gouging/articleshow/88721869.cms||---

As per official estimates, there are 24.4 lakh adolescents in this category in the state. The 12.7 lakh doses cover about 52% of the eligible beneficiaries. This is the highest among all the states in the country. Himachal Pradesh has vaccinated about 49% of the eligible teenagers. Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Gujarat jabbed more than 30% people in this cohort. As per the Union government’s guidelines, only Covaxin is being administered to the 15-18 age group. The intense vaccination drive in Andhra Pradesh can be gauged from the fact that it is being conducted at 6,800 vaccination centres. From door-to-door drives to converting the educational institutions as temporary vaccination centres, the field-level staff are going all out to improve the vaccination coverage. The health department wants to conclude the immunisation process for the teenagers in a week. As the gap is only 28 days between the two doses of Covaxin, the 15-18 group would also be given the second shot by February.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/with-over-50-coverage-ap-leads-in-15-18-group-vax-in-country/articleshow/88721870.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

This is the highest one-day case total in over two months after the state recorded 481 cases on October 29, 2021. The state did not record any deaths from the novel coronavirus disease in the last 24 hours. Altogether, 102 patients were declared cured across the state. There are currently 1,848 active cases with 20,62,029 cumulative recoveries and 14,499 fatalities. Chittoor reported 68 new infections, followed by Visakhapatnam (63) and Krishna (61).

---||Delhi||Eyes on polls, EDMC nixes tax-hike proposals||NEW DELHI: With the municipal elections due in the city in a few months, the deliberative wing of East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) has decided to reject all proposals made by the commissioner for increasing the property tax rates and levying new taxes in his budget speech for the financial year 2022-23. Presenting the budget estimates for 2022-23 and the revised budget for 2021-22, the east corporation’s standing committee chairman, Bir Singh Panwar, said the committee had not accepted any proposal for tax hike. To improve the financial condition of the cash-strapped EDMC by increasing its revenues, the commissioner had suggested a 2-3% increase in property tax on residential and non-residential categories, 5% on government accommodations, and a 10-time (Rs 5 to Rs 50) increase in fees for obtaining building sanction plans. He had also proposed increasing the theatre tax and levying three new taxes — professional and betterment taxes, and education cess. Till November 5, 2021, Rs 112 crore was collected as property tax while EDMC targets to get Rs 350 crore by March 2022. Last year, Rs 209 crore was collected. “We are emphasising on bringing more properties under the tax net. While UPIC numbers have been issued to seven lakh dwelling units, we are assessing people liable to pay tax with the help of councillors,” Panwar said. The civic body has also identified 5,000 electric poles for installing advertisements and earn Rs 2-3 crore annually, he added. “About 152 unipoles have been used for placing advertisements and tendering process is on for increasing such advertisements. After repeated efforts, we have been successful in getting a share in advertisement revenues from agencies like DTC, DTIDC, DIMTS, etc.” EDMC has initiated work on setting up a faecal sludge management system at 20 sites by investing Rs 33 crore. The system is already installed at five places and operational near three community toilets. To improve operations at parking lots, EDMC may issue identity cards to attendants and parking slips through point of sale machines to avoid overcharging, said Panwar. The corporation has also decided to go for a public-private partnership to run its primary healthcare centres, including dispensaries, polyclinics and maternity childcare centres. “This way we can improve the condition of buildings, utilise them properly and also help the needy people,” said the chairman. For improving medical services at Swami Dayanand Hospital, there is a plan to develop it into a 600-bed multispecialty block in place of the existing ward block. In addition to various arrangements made to deal with the recent Covid surge and increasing cases of Omicron infections, the public health department has got 2,000 sq metre additional area near Buland Masjid in Shastri Park to extend the burial ground, said the chairman.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/eyes-on-polls-edmc-nixes-tax-hike-proposals/articleshow/88719743.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Lucknow||AIMIM meet to discuss status of Muslims in UP||Lucknow: After Telangana and Maharashtra, the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) is all set to host a conference on the topic, ‘Muslims in UP – Development, security and inclusion’, in Lucknow. The conference, to be organised on Friday, will dwell at length on a recent study on the current conditions of Muslims in terms of demography, challenges in education (including madrassas), participation in industrial sector, entrepreneurship, population aspects, criminalisation and incarceration, and state budget for minorities over the years. The study, which will be tabled at the conference, is based on data collected mostly from government reports available in public domain and from works of well-known names in the field of research. Talking about the need for the conference and the study on Muslims in UP, AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi said that talking about various aspects related to the Muslim community without backing it with credible empirical data was usually dismissed as rhetoric. “More than 80% of the data used in the study has been picked from government records available in public domain. The remaining data has come from exhaustive academic works of leading researchers,” Owaisi told TOI on Wednesday. “The data available does not give a rosy picture of what the community is dealing with at present and more effort is required from all quarters to improve the situation,” he said. “Muslims constitute 19.25% of the total population of UP against the national figure of 14.23%. However, 71.2% of Muslims above 15 years are illiterate or educated below the primary level in UP as compared to the national average of 58.3%. The educational profile of Muslims in 2019-20 as per PLFS shows that at least 40.83% Muslims are illiterate as compared to the overall illiteracy rate of 34.01%. Such data is essential to fix responsibility on those responsible for the state of affairs,” he said. On the timing of the conference in Lucknow just ahead of the 2022 Assembly polls, Owaisi said the basic idea was to attract attention from all quarters of the society on the condition of Muslims in India. “And what better a time than before the elections when issues related to communities and people get more attention,” he said. Experts who will present the study at the conference include associate professor from CESS Dr Venkatanarayana Motukuri, Prof Abdul Shaban from TISS (Mumbai), former member of the National Statistical Commission PC Mohanan, and former advisor to Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Dr Amir Ullah Khan, who is serving as research director at the Centre for Development Policy and Practice (CDPP). The panel associated with the study includes Amitabh Kundu, who headed the Kundu Committee constituted by the Union ministry of minority affairs, professor at International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS), Mumbai, Chandra Shekhar, research lead at the King’s College London, Christophe Jaffrelot, visiting professor at Wingate University, North Carolina, Usha Sanyal, SV Subramanian from Harvard University, chairman of International Institute of Migration and Development, Trivandrum, C Ravi, and retired IAS officer and former chief election commissioner SY Quraishi.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/aimim-meet-to-discuss-status-of-muslims-in-up/articleshow/88721029.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

On Wednesday, 11 patients were hospitalized at NCH and eight in Surat Municipal Institute of Medical Education and Research (SMIMER), the second biggest government hospital for Covid, where 1,300 beds are available. In NCH and SMIMER, three PSA plants each are in place and around four MT oxygen can be generated at each hospital. NCH has 43 MT storage capacity. There are 450 doctors present at NCH of which around 100 are part of the core team that will be employed to manage Covid patients. “Considering the need, we will increase the paramedical staff. At present, the hospitalization is less but we have made preparations based on past experience,” said a senior doctor at NCH.  In the dedicated Covid hospital at Stem Cell building in NCH, there are 400 ICU beds while 600 are for other Covid patients. “If there are more paediatric patients, we will have to keep some beds reserved for the guardians accompanying them,” said the NCH official. BOX Buses to run with 50% capacity Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) will run buses with 50% passengers from Thursday. The advisory was issued on Wednesday considering the rising number of cases.

---||Visakhapatnam||Third wave scare grips Andhra Pradesh as Covid infections surge||VISAKHAPATNAM: Andhra Pradesh seems to be staring at a possible third wave of Covid-19, fuelled by the Omicron (B1.1.529) variant. The case positivity rate consistently remained under 1% in November (0.7%) and December, 2021 (0.5%). The daily case total hovered around 100 to 200 during this time. But the case count and positivity rate are going northwards again following the three-month downward spiral last year. For instance, the daily case total climbed to 434 on Wednesday from 54 infections just a week ago. For the first time in over two months, the daily case positivity rate in Andhra Pradesh crossed the 1% mark on January 4 (1.2%), Tuesday, and it further increased to 1.3% on Wednesday. The situation looks similar to that of March 2020 and 2021, particularly with metro cities like Mumbai and Delhi posting exploding case numbers. The officials in the districts are gearing up to tackle the anticipated third wave. For instance, collectors of Srikakulam and Visakhapatnam conducted review meetings with the medical officials on Tuesday to take stock of the situation and how to handle the impending outbreak. The experiences from the devastating second wave, particularly from the peak in May-June, still haunt the public and the state administration, which even overwhelmed the crematoriums. The steep increase in cases pushed the state’s health system to the brink in the second quarter of last year. The state has administered both the doses of Covid-19 vaccine to more than 3 crore people (or 75% of the total eligible beneficiaries). Even though the officials are not sure about the scale and severity of the third wave or how the vaccination coverage would help prevent severe infections or hospitalisations, the state is almost set to tackle the surge in the case numbers. As the Omicron is said to be highly transmissible than the earlier variants and doubling the cases in just a few days, an unprecedented increase in the case numbers is anticipated. Andhra Pradesh has lined up 707 hospitals with about 50,000 beds for the third wave. The state has significantly ramped up oxygen infrastructure at hospitals, considering the experiences from the second wave. The Union government has recently asked the states ‘to leave no stone unturned in ramping up infrastructure to manage a high surge so that India escapes unscathed from this episode of Covid-19’. State Covid-19 nodal officer and director, Visakha Institute of Medical Sciences, Dr K Rambabu cautioned the public in view of the increasing cases. “We request the public to strictly follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. The unvaccinated people should immediately complete their vaccination schedule,” said Dr Rambabu.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/third-wave-scare-grips-ap-as-infections-surge/articleshow/88721875.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Visakhapatnam||No salary, no life-saving equipment, Visakhapatnam lifeguards watch hopes running aground||VISAKHAPATNAM: Though the lifeguards have rescued hundreds of people from drowning on the beaches in Vizag city, they are struggling to survive as they have not been paid salaries for past nine months. They are still ill-equipped in terms of gadgets and their repeated requests for life-saving equipment fell on deaf ears.  They fear they might not be able to enjoy the biggest festival in state - Sankranti - if pending salaries are not paid before the festival this month. The Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC), with the support of government, had recruited the lifeguards (experts in swimming in blue waters) to assist the city police in rescue activities. The recruitment began in 2012 when 18 lifeguards from fishermen community were employed. The number has now risen to 40. However, one lifeguard died while trying to save a beach visitor and another quit the job. Now, a total of 38 lifeguards are deployed on Yarada, RK, Rushikonda and a few other beaches in the city to save people from drowning. Speaking to TOI, one of the lifeguards, Rao (name changed), said they have rescued over 100 people from drowning in the past two years (2020 and 2021). “We have been saving lives by risking our own as we don’t have life-saving equipment such as life-jackets, lifebuoys, ropes, public announce system or boats. We face a lot of challenges sometimes (when rip current is high) to save visitors.  “We have been advising the visitors not to venture into the waters as the rip current is high and sharp stones are present... There are possibilities of drowning deaths. But some visitors ignore our advice and venture into the waters. It may land us in trouble when the rip current is high as we are not equipped. We have made temporary life-jackets using abandon thermocol sheets,” said another lifeguard.  “While we are busy saving lives on the beaches, nobody seems to be bothered about us. How can we lead a family life without salaries. We are appealing the authorities to ensure life-saving equipment and timely disbursement of salaries to us, they added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/no-salary-no-life-saving-equipment-city-lifeguards-watch-hopes-running-aground/articleshow/88721876.cms||Nalla.Babu

Government authorities are now trying to pacify the traditional fishermen and also the ring net fishermen who chased each other in the blue waters on Tuesday. It may be recalled that around six boats were either partially or fully damaged after a few fishermen set them on fire on Tuesday. Tension has gripped villages including Vasavanipalem, Mangamaripeta, Chepaluppada, Jalari Yendada and Peda Jalaripeta areas. Section 144 of Cr.PC is clamped in the villages. Fisheries minister Sidiri Appala Raju, along with minister M Srinivasa Rao, district collector, and police commissioner urged the fishermen to go fishing with coordination. He said fishermen should follow rules and regulations. He added a technical committee has been formed with state and Central government employees to resolve the problem. Persons who have boats under Marine Fisheries Regular Act should have licences for the nets. Fisheries department commissioner K Kannababu said ring nets should be used beyond 8 km jurisdiction. City police chief Manish Kumar Sinha told TOI that cops would follow the high court order on the issue. “Fishing is banned for some time as Section 145 has been imposed by the district collector.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/2-fishermen-leaders-held-for-clashes/articleshow/88721877.cms||Siva G

The protest near Raj Bhavan entered its 37th day on Wednesday seeking implementation of central guidelines and continuation of contract of the existing workers. The protestors accused the state government of bypassing central guidelines and going for fresh appointments. “SBM(G) is a centrally sponsored scheme. In this, 60% funding is done by the Centre while the rest 40% is borne by the state. The Centre has extended the project by introducing phase-II. It had written to all the states/UTs to include the contractual workers in phase-II before making any fresh recruitments. But instead, the Jharkhand government has removed the existing employees, creating new vacancies,” said Ashish Kumar SBM(G) in-charge.The protestors met chief secretary Sukhdeo Singh on Tuesday and handed over a letter to the secretary, drinking water and sanitation department (DWSD) Prashant Kumar, on the former’s direction. “Since we haven’t heard anything from the authorities, we have organised this mass tonsure to draw their attention,” added Kumar.Ramnath Mahto, a protestor after shaving his head, said, “The government is not listening to our demands. The tonsure programme is for the government to feel ashamed.”The 1,118 workers want to enroll themselves back into phase-II of SBM(G). Ramesh Chandra Mahto, another protestor, said, “We want our jobs back. We want the state government to roll back its decision as well as review it based on the norms of the central government.”The Swachh Bharat Mission is moving towards phase-II of SBM(G) i.e. open defecation free (ODF)-Plus. This move is taken to reinforce ODF behaviour and focus on providing interventions for safe management of solid and liquid waste.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/employees-of-swachh-bharat-mission-go-for-mass-tonsure-to-demand-jobs-back/articleshow/88721884.cms||---

Of them, eight were on oxygen support while the remaining were mildly symptomatic with no severe medical complications. Likewise, Ranchi sadar hospital said there were 16 patients in its Covid ward, mostly with mild to moderate symptoms.“As of Tuesday night, private and government hospitals in the city had 240 Covid patients in total, mostly with mild to moderate symptoms,” an official in the district health services said.Kanke MLA Samri Lal was wheeled into the Covid ward of Rims with breathlessness and other symptoms and was put on oxygen support. The hospital management said Lal’s samples were collected and sent for an RT-PCR test, the result of which was awaited till evening.“It is very early to comment about a trend but based on what we have seen so far, the cases are mostly asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic,” Ranchi civil surgeon Dr Vinod Kumar told TOI. “None of our patients are on oxygen support. There are a few who got themselves admitted as a preventive measure so that others in their family do not get infected,” Kumar added.Dr Pradeep Bhattacharya, head of trauma and critical care at Rims, said, “The strain is far more infectious than the previous Delta strain (which emerged as the predominant strain during the deadly second wave) and that is why it is infecting everyone, including those who are fully vaccinated. But it is far less virulent than the previous strain and patients are recovering in less time.”Doctors are seeing this as a silver lining. With the active caseload likely to breach 4,000-mark, asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients can be clinically managed in home isolation. “This will take the load off the healthcare infrastructure,” a doctor said. On Wednesday, the Centre released a revised guideline to states asking to home isolate asymptomatic patients with 93% oxygen saturation levels upon recommendations of the treating medical officer.Ranchi had 3,370 active cases as on Tuesday late night while 43 patients were declared fit or discharged. “Even though we are yet to get the genome sequencing reports of the samples which have been sent to ILS Bhubaneswar, the symptoms among the patients are similar to those in states where high numbers of Omicron infections were found,” said a city doctor on anonymity.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/most-patients-asymptomatic-or-have-mild-symptoms-docs/articleshow/88721887.cms||Dhritiman Ray

The inmates can only interact with their families through e-mulakat.The jail administration is presenting the prisoners before the court through video conferencing.Inspector general (prison) Manoj Kumar said that his administration is remaining alert and several measures are in place to prevent the outbreak of the disease inside prisons. He added that so far none of the jail inmates are Covid positive.“An isolation ward has been set up in each hospital within the jails’ premises to admit the Covid patients. In prisons where there are no hospitals, the inmates would be treated at the place designated by the district administration,” Kumar added.The prisoners are also being shifted to less crowded wards and jails. “The process has been underway for the past few months,” Kumar said. Prisoners aged above 60 are already being kept in separate wards at Birsa Munda Central Jail. The administration has also asked the district administration for vaccination of new prisoners who have arrived in the past two to three months.The jail authorities are thinking of implementing a plan in which the prisoners are graded on the basis of their age and co-morbid condition so that adequate care can be taken in case they get infected. A similar method was adopted by the jail administration during the second wave of Covid last year.Meanwhile, judicial commissioner (Ranchi) A K Rai has ordered that hearing in Ranchi district court would be held virtually till January 15 in view of the spike in Covid cases.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Refurbished British-era runway operational||NEW DELHI: The rehabilitation work of Indira Gandhi International Airport’s British-era runway 09/27, also known as the first runway, has been completed. The British constructed the 2,816-metre long and 60-metre wide runway in the pre-Independence era and used it during World War-II. Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL) handed over the refurbished runway to Air Traffic Control for commercial operations on December 24, 2021. It complies with CAT-I Instrument Landing System, which assists pilots in landing an aircraft in low visibility conditions. “The British-era runway and its taxiways were rehabilitated and made operational for commercial operations as part of DIAL’s effort to enhance the infrastructure and passenger experience to make IGI Airport future-ready. The runway will have a design life of 20 years and will be instrumental in handling the increased air traffic movements of the pre-pandemic levels,” said I Prabhakar Rao, deputy managing director, GMR Group. The work was undertaken as part of the phase-3A expansion project. Post completion of the phase-3A expansion work, IGI would become future-ready. Its passenger handling capacity would increase to 100 million per annum (MPPA) and the airside capacity would reach 140 MPPA. The major rehabilitation works included milling down of the entire length of the runway’s flexible pavement to a depth of 60mm and overlaying it with polymer modified bitumen, which can withstand heavy-duty traffic and extreme weather conditions. Runway 09/27, which is on the northern side of the airport, has a network of nine taxiways out of which six are connecting and three rapid exit taxiways. DIAL has also realigned a new 3.5km taxiway parallel to runway 09/27. “This will reduce the runway occupancy time and help in improving the traffic flow. The airfield ground lighting system for runway 09/27 has also been upgraded with a duct and pit system. All existing lights are now LEDs for higher efficiency and reliability. DIAL is constructing a 7.3km drain on both sides of the runway to cater to the runoff water,” said a statement from DIAL.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/refurbished-british-era-runway-operational/articleshow/88719757.cms||---

Most of them are asymptomatic, but their Covid-positive status has put them in isolation and out of the battle. It’s an alarming sign.  Doctors and other health workers have been fighting tirelessly on the frontlines of the war against Covid, and going by what’s happening worldwide, more demands will be made of them. As per MGM Medical College’s official records, three resident doctors are admitted to MRTB Hospital and a fourth is in home isolation. “All four recently tested positive for Covid. They are asymptomatic. They all had travel histories and tested positive after returning to Indore,” dean Dr Sanjay Dixit told TOI. MGM Medical College Alumni Association’s secretary and ex-president of IMA Indore wing Dr Sanjay Londhe said that at least 20 doctors and a few members of paramedical staff have tested positive in the last 10-15 days. Doctors and paramedical staff, who have been assigned duty in Covid wards, are following the same protocol as in the first and second waves, Dr Dixit said. “They wear PPE kits and are following all other norms. There’s no instance of any health staff getting infected while working in Covid wards,”he said. A faculty member of the microbiology department was infected a fortnight ago and a repeat sample tested positive a week ago. Two doctors of Sri Aurobindo Institute of Medical Sciences (SAIMS) have also tested positive in the past week after returning from other cities. “While people are advised not to lower their guard and follow all Covid guidelines, doctors and paramedical staff have been asked to take all the precautions, have a good sleep and home-made food to avoid falling ill due to the virus,” pulmonologist Dr Ravi Dosi said. “Most of the doctors, who have tested positive to the disease, have their recent travel history during last week of 2021” Dr Sanjay Londhe said, adding that almost all the doc- tors are fully vaccinated and asymptomatic. “Among those detected in the recent past, the disease is not causing major health problems, including breathlessness, which was seen in the second wave in April and May when Covid claimed so many lives,” he said. The 64th All India Congress of Obstetrics & Gynecology to be organized by the Indore wing from January 9-13 has been postponed due to Covid. Over 500 doctors were expected to attend.

Under police protection, Muda officials pulled down structures using two earth-moving vehicles during an early morning drive and took possession of the sites, which officials claims are worth Rs 25 crore. In all, five sites, each measuring 50x80 ft in Vijayanagar IV Stage, I Phase Layout, adjoining the outer ring road in the western side, have been taken into possession of Muda. Site numbers 1283 to 1287, according to Muda, were encroached and structures were built. Muda commissioner DB Natesh told TOI that during the land audit process they came to know the sites belonged to Muda and upon verification, it was found to be true. Later an order was passed to reclaim the land and accordingly its possessions were taken after bringing down structures build there. “The people who had built concrete structures have been claiming that their land was taken over by the authority for the construction of Outer Ring Road. And the land on which they had constructed buildings belonged to them. Actually, the land belongs to Muda,” said Natesh. Sources claimed that the structures were built a few months ago.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/muda-reclaims-5-sites-worth-5-crore-each/articleshow/88721916.cms||---

---||Kochi||Over 50% preterm babies need neonatal ICU admission: Study||Kochi: More than a half of the preterm babies — those born alive before 37 weeks of pregnancy — require neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission. In contrast, only 7% of term babies needed NICU admission. In preterm babies, there were also concerns about growth retardation and abnormalities, shows a study from Kerala. Addressing the burden of preterm birth is crucial for the state to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). Kerala has shown a downward trend of neonatal mortality in 6 per 1,000 live births, infant mortality in 7 per 1,000 live births and maternal mortality rates in 43 per 1,00,000 live births. The decline of infant mortality rates has shifted the focus now to perinatal mortality rates which is a good indicator of the quality of care for both mother and child. Though significant advances have been made in the management of preterm delivery and related complications, focus on preventable factors is still lacking. Therefore, identifying the risk factors associated with preterm delivery is important as this can help in early and appropriate risk-specific management and this was the primary objective of the study conducted by Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences (AIMS), Kochi. “Preterm delivery contributes to neonatal mortality and infant mortality. For a state like Kerala, it is very important to address all the preventable causes through an efficient health system. But so far, most efforts have been focussed on tertiary interventions. These measures have reduced perinatal morbidity and mortality, but the incidence of preterm birth is increasing,” said Dr Aswathy Sreedevi, Department of Community Medicine, AIMS and corresponding author of the study. Dr Sreedevi added that the clinical implication of this is that advances in primary and secondary care is necessary to prevent anemia, urinary tract infection (UTI) and control blood pressure through adequate medication. Besides, women with systemic diseases require additional care to prevent the risk of preterm birth. AIMS analyzed delivery room records from 2016 to 2018 in the department of Obstetrics and Gynecology and looked at data of 191 women who delivered before 37 completed weeks of gestation (preterm birth) and 200 women who delivered at or after 37 weeks. Results showed that pregnancy induced hypertension, abnormal amniotic fluid volume, premature rupture of membranes, previous history of preterm delivery, history of UTI during pregnancy, systemic diseases, and anemia were independent risk factors for preterm delivery. This resulted in not only lower birth weight— average birth weight of 2kg in preterm babies compared to 3.1kg among term babies — but fetal outcomes were also poor with 2% deaths compared to none in the control group. About 5% of preterm babies had intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), 7% had a cardiac abnormality, 3% had renal abnormalities and 3% had respiratory distress.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/over-50-preterm-babies-need-neonatal-icu-admission-study/articleshow/88719763.cms||Preetu Nair

---||Raipur||First Omicron case reported in Chhattisgarh's Bilaspur||RAIPUR: Chhattisgarh on Wednesday reported first case of Omicron variant found in a 52-year-old man from Bilaspur district. The man had recently returned from United Arab Emirates and his samples were sent for genome sequencing test to Bhubaneswar. His report states that Omicron variant was found in his body. Expressing concern of inability of assess which variant has hit Chhattisgarh in absence of genome sequence lab and no case of Omicron diagnosed yet, health minister TS Singhdeo has written to Union minister Mansukh Mandavia requesting him to open genome sequencing lab at Raipur AIIMS and Raipur Medical College. Presently, the samples from state are being sent to Odisha for genome sequencing which is a prolonged process and the reports are awaited. Singhdeo is in home isolation since he was tested positive for coronavirus on Sunday. “I would like to bring it to your notice that Chhattisgarh doesn’t have a facility or lab to test ‘genome sequencing’ and we have to send the samples to Bhubaneshwar to seek test reports for the same. This takes a lot of time and as the testing process is slow, it is becoming difficult to identify if the Covid variant in our state is Omicron, Delta or something else. This is becoming a huge hurdle is sketching out strategies in order to take prevention and precautionary measures and also the line of treatment for Covid patients,” Singhdeo wrote in the letter. Singhdeo said that the changing forms of Covid19 and its new variants has become a serious cause of concern globally and India isn’t untouched with it either. Most of the states have reported cases of new variant of Covid19 in the country and as Chhattisgarh borders several states, the surge is being witnessed here too. “Considering the present circumstances in Chhattisgarh, I am requesting you to immediately initiate genome sequencing tests at AIIMS Raipur and also extend financial and technical support to state to start the same lab at Raipur Medical College. It’s important to prepare and arrange for better treatment and facilities for spread of infection,” Singhdeo asserted. The state witnessed spike in Covid19 cases with 14 doctors at a Rajnandgaon hospital, six Border Security Force jawans and 14 personnel of Chhattisgarh Armed Force in Bijapur district. Senior police officials have decided to quarantine all security personnel for 14 days who are returning from leave and have come in contact with other jawans. The doctors found infected at Pendri Medical College hospital underwent Covid test since two intern doctors were tested positive for coronavirus about two days back and they had all come in contact with the duo. The antigen test report stated all 14 of them were found infected. All of them show mild symptoms and were quarantined. Situation seems to be going grave even in Bastar region with six jawans of battalion 17 of BSF and 14 CAF in Bijapur were found infected while five Shasatra Seema Bal personnel in Kanhargaon camp in Kanker were already Covid positive other 38 CoBRA jawans were reported infected in Sukma on Monday. Most of these infected jawans had recently returned form leave from other states and have been isolated in barracks only as of now. District officials said that in case of any serious symptoms, the jawans would be shifted to hospital. It was also decided that the security personnel returning from leave must quarantine themselves and get tested in case of any symptom. Amid reports of few doctors infected in PG hostel of Raipur Medical College and Dental College, Raipur district administration has declared 21 containment zones and have sealed as many residential apartments that have reported surge in Covid cases.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/cgs-1st-omicron-case-detected-in-bilaspur/articleshow/88721929.cms||Rashmi Drolia

According to police, the pigeon landed on the roof of the house of Naga Raju, who feeds birds regularly. After noticing the rubber tag, Naga Raju got suspicious that the pigeon was on a spy mission from China. The bird had injuries and it was not in a position to fly. Locals, who saw the tag on the pigeon’s leg, too grew suspicious about the bird and word of mouth reached the police and the revenue authorities. After examining the bird and ascertaining it was not on any spy mission, the authorities referred it to a veterinarian for medical aid. To add to the rumour mill was the talk of similar pigeons on alleged spy missions being found in Odisha and Tamil Nadu. V Anjaneyulu, sub-inspector of Chimakurthy police station, told TOI they did not find any Chinese script on the tag or any electronic device on the bird. “We have preliminarily identified that pigeon racing is rampant in Chennai and other parts of Tamil Nadu in winter. There is nothing to panic about,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/spy-pigeon-creates-flutter-in-prakasam/articleshow/88721941.cms||Venu Lanka

Sunday markets are witnessing hundreds of stalls selling country chickens ahead of Sankranti. Demand for protein rich non-veg food has increased after the Covid-19 second wave. As per the suggestion of the doctors, people are adding poultry to their regular diet resulting in demand for chicken increasing drastically. A series of studies exposing the harmful effects of antibiotics and drugs used in raising broiler chicken triggered the sudden demand for the country chicken. Amaravati Poultry Traders’ Association said consumption of country chicken has increased by around 300 per cent in the city. “Broiler chicken is available for 220 per kg but many prefer buying country chicken at 410 per kg. Health awareness among public is the main reason for the increase in demand for country chicken. We are striving to meet the demand,” said K Narayana, a poultry trader in the city. Taking advantage of the situation, many farmers in Nuzividu, Agiripalli, Gannavaram, and Hanuman Junction areas have started country chicken farms. Farmers said raising country chicken is cheaper when compared to broiler chickens, but it takes time. “We usually go for broiler chicken farming. We usually get the returns after 65 days. But raising country chickens will take around 150 days. Expenses on the feed are low and they need less medical attention,” said M Ramu from Gannavaram who runs a country chicken farm. Meanwhile, poultry traders estimate that the price of country chicken will shoot up to 500 per kg during Sankranti this month.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/demand-for-country-chicken-rises-by-300-as-covid-changes-eating-habits/articleshow/88721943.cms||Venu Lanka

It was further argued that the recent amendment to the FCR Act has been challenged and the apex court reserved the judgment. Even before the judgment was pronounced, the Union government went on to cancel licences of the organisations. The cancellation of FCRA licence of Missionaries of Charities based on ‘adverse inputs’ received is legally untenable, argued Paul.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/evangelist-moves-sc-on-fcra-row/articleshow/88721944.cms||---

The number of big cats in the reserve has gone up from zero to 25 in 12 years. On Wednesday, the forest administration captured nearly four-year-old tigress ST-19 with two cubs in a trap camera installed at Alwar buffer range, Barliwari forest block. Chief minister Ashok Gehlot tweeted, “It’s good to learn that Tigress ST-19 has been sighted with cubs in Sariska. Nice to see the wildlife thrive in Rajasthan.” The cubs are expected to be two months old and first litter of the tigress. Field director of Sariska Tiger Reserve, R N Meena said, “After witnessing the physical changes in the tigress body in October, the patrolling in the area was increased and it was constantly monitored. Two cubs, which are nearly two months old, were captured in the trap camera.” At present, there are 25 tigers at STR, including five cubs. Dinesh Durani, local advisory committee (LAC) member, said, “There are 11 females, nine males, five cubs at the park. Birth of cubs within one year has given a fresh lease of life to the reserve.” Conservation efforts made in the recent past have started bearing fruits as tigresses have started giving birth to cubs at the reserve. Simrat Sandhu, member of state board for wildlife, said, “The tiger reserve has got immense potential and fortunately started flourishing. The state government should put its focus on the Sariska and resolve the long pending issues including tiger relocation from other reserves to diversify the gene pool.” The reserve is spread across 1,281 square kilometre area and is divided into six ranges. Experts claimed that the park can easily house 42-45 big cats. According to the guidelines of the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), the government of Rajasthan had notified 881.11 square kilometre areas as critical tiger habitat on December 28, 2007. “As per records, currently there are 26 villages in critical tiger habitat that need to be relocated and that are said to be violating the tiger habitat. Out of these, 10 villages are on ‘Priority I’ and the rest are on ‘Priority II’. Once these villages are shifted, it could provide suitable environment for the tigers to grow,” said an expert.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/tigress-gives-birth-to-2-cubs-in-sariska-count-reaches-25/articleshow/88721945.cms||---

Akhilesh tweeted the video and titled his post as “BJP ka kaam, apradhi sareaam (In BJP regime, criminals roaming about free)”. The listed gangster from Jaunpur even carries a cash reward on his arrest and is wanted in a murder case. Taking potshots at chief minister Yogi Adityanath, Akhilesh suggested that “Babaji (chief minister) should organise a cricket tournament on the lines of IPL (Indian Premier League) and name it MBL – Mafia BJP League”. “The district police chief seems to have already laid the pitch for the match. The BJP should include all top 10 listed gangsters in this team,” Akhilesh tweeted and said the CM can captain the team. Asked about his comment on the video tweeted by the SP chief, DGP Mukul Goel said: “The matter is being investigated. Action would be taken.” This is not the first time that Dhananjay Singh has made headlines for his public appearance.

Officials said that so far SDMC was allowing only the contractors registered and enlisted under various categories with the three municipal corporations and this was shrinking the competition. There were instances when the departments were forced to call the tender for a project again and again to find a suitable contractor, they added. “This step will lead to a healthy competition, achieving higher quality standards in the tendering process, and completion of quality work,” said an official. SDMC’s enlistment rules will be applicable to outside registered contractors with necessary changes and will also cover the enlisted contractors registered on the e-tendering website, www.etendersgov.in, he added.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Omicron dominates Covid surge, most cases mild and don’t need hospitalisation||JAIPUR: Omicron variant is now dominating the surge in Covid cases in the state. The genome sequencing’s weekly report issued on Tuesday showed that 71% of the positive samples were Omicron variant. “Four weeks ago, around 2% of all samples send for genome sequencing were found infected with Omicron. It has now increased to 71%. The surge is now leading by Omicron variant,” Vaibhav Galriya, health (secretary) told TOI. For the past few days, the percentage of samples tested positive for Omicron has been increasing. While Omicron cases are 71%, around 28% of samples have tested positive for Delta and Delta-like variants in the state. Few weeks ago, the dominant variant in the state was Delta. The samples tested positive for Delta variant was 75.7% and 15.37% were Delta like variants. But, the situation has now completely changed and the state is witnessing surge in Covid cases. “People need to be careful as Omicron has a R naught value of 20-25, which means a person infected with the variant can spread it to 20-25 persons. In case of Delta, the R naught value was 6-7 and when the first cases reported (Wuhan), the R naught value was 2. The importance of Covid appropriate behaviour is more now as Omicron has higher infectivity. If anyone has cold, cough or influenza like illness, he should isolate himself and get tested for Covid and prevent the virus from spreading,” said Dr Sudhir Bhandari, principal and controller, SMS Medical College. Omicron can evade immunity, which is why, doctors appeal people to remain alert. “There are cases of re-infection due to Omicron variant in the city. We are witnessing cases in which Omicron has evaded immunity from past infection or two vaccine doses, which is a concern. So, those who have immunity from past infection should also remain alert. Also, those who have immunity from two vaccines are also getting infected. People should strict follow Covid appropriate behaviour. Though the cases have been increasing, hospitalisation is negligible,” said Dr Virendra Singh, member, state’s Covid advisory committee to the state government. According to doctors, the severity of Covid, which was seen during the second wave, has not been seen yet. The cases which require oxygen support in the hospitals are very few this time around so far. At the biggest dedicated Covid RUHS Hospital here, only 38 patients are undergoing treatment for Covid currently. “Out of 38 patients admitted to the hospital, only seven are in the ICU. No patient in the ICU is requiring invasion ventilator. Out of seven ICU patients, five are on oxygen support and two are on non-invasive ventilator,” said Dr Ajit Singh, superintendent, RUHS Hospital. However, over the past few days, the admissions in hospitals have increased slightly but majority of them do not have any severity.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/omicron-dominates-covid-surge-most-cases-mild-dont-need-hospitalisation/articleshow/88721956.cms||Syed Intishab Ali

The prosecution also filed a petition at Ernakulam CJM court seeking the permission to record the statement of filmmaker P Balachandrakumar under CrPC Section 164 as he had given statements against actor Dileep, who is an accused in the case. Earlier, the Supreme Court had set Feb 16 as the deadline for trial completion in the case. Following Balachandrakumar’s revelations, the investigation team launched a detailed probe in the case. Also, the investigation officer has been directed by the additional special sessions court in Ernakulam to file a fresh report, based on the ongoing probe, by Jan 20. Due to the fresh probe, the prosecution needs more time for trial and based on this request, the state government filed a petition in the Supreme Court.

Another reason is the recent resignation of the special prosecutor. The petition submitted that a new special prosecutor needs to be appointed in the case and he will have to study the case from the beginning before appearing for trial. Moreover, the survivor wrote to the chief minister requesting a detailed probe into the allegations raised by Balachandrakumar. Hence, a six-month extension was sought. On Wednesday, SIT filed a petition at CJM Court to record the secret statement of Balachandrakumar. The court will appoint a magistrate to record his statement. The filmmaker, during an interview with a television channel, had claimed that Dileep had watched the video of the sexual assault at his home and had influenced some witnesses in the case. Also, he added that Dileep had known the first accused Sunil Kumar alias Pulsar Suni. Meanwhile, sources said that a new investigation team is likely to be constituted for further probe.

Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) officials want co-morbid and senior citizens quarantined in home even if they are not infected. “The spread of infection will drop if not only the identified infected patients, but healthy people also start isolating themselves.

We have already crossed five days and we need to be careful for 40 days now,” Pani added. People are advised by the SMC to follow Covid rules strictly. SMC has asked citizens to wear masks, maintain social distance, wash hands and avoid visiting places with poor air ventilation including hotels, gymnasiums, libraries and the theatres.

If it is held in a closed space, not more than 100 people are allowed to attend. This applies on weekend curfews as well. “We have invited about 400 people to our wedding, and invitations have already been distributed. Now, it will be embarrassing for us to call our guests and inform them that they cannot come due to the restriction in numbers,” said a couple who are getting married on Saturday.Melisha Lobo, a healthcare professional, who had planned the cradling ceremony of her first child on Sunday, said, “The new guidelines will not be inconvenient for me, since the guest list is small.” A caterer said they are in a dilemma over the new curbs. “So far, no client who has their wedding on weekends, has informed us about the changes. Meanwhile, those whose weddings are scheduled in another two days, have reduced their number of guests. We were getting back to normal this season, and imposing such restrictions again are hampering our industry. How can we survive?” he questioned. Another caterer said that some wedding organisers have booked and invited more than 1,000 guests. “We are unsure about how they will manage the numbers,” he said.Videographer Punith Salian said that he is receiving cancellation or postponement of events scheduled this week. “On Wednesday, one of the organisers informed us they cannot hold a wedding with only 200 guests, and therefore decided to postpone it,” said Punith, adding that more cancellations may happen.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/restriction-on-guests-upsets-organisers/articleshow/88721980.cms||---

At a time when a lot of promotional schemes are announced for CNG users, and the demand for CNG vehicles is also on the rise, the existing CNG users of Mangaluru were shocked that GAIL Gas (India) Limited increased the price by Rs 18 from January 1, said Haikadi Shrinath Rao, a pharma personnel and founder of the association.He told TOI that the price that was Rs 57 per kg till December 31, was increased to Rs 75 per kg. Meanwhile, in Udupi and other districts in the state, CNG is available at prices between Rs 59 and Rs 65. Many of them are private players there. In Bengaluru too, the price is around Rs 62/kg and GAIL Gas Limited has launched special schemes for Bengaluru Urban and Rural districts, for the benefit of CNG-commercial vehicle owners. According to an estimate, there are around 4,000 CNG vehicles in the city, including a bus. “GAIL officials have assured to look into the issue. Earlier, CNG was being transported from Bengaluru, and it is surprising that with the commissioning of the mother station at Panambur recently, the CNG prices have increased. The rising price will have an impact on the purchase of CNG vehicles, at a time when 15 CNG buses are set to hit the city roads soon,” he said.A delegation met deputy commissioner K V Rajendra and MLA D Vedavyas Kamath on Monday. Another round of meetings will be held with the MLA on Tuesday evening. An official from GAIL said that decisions on pricing is taken at the headquarters. Prices may be reduced in the future. Promotional schemes will also be launched in Mangaluru soon, the official said. Deputy Commissioner K V Rajendra said that a meeting in this regard will be held soon.

The couple had decided to separate following serious differences.The 48-year-old pharmacy owner and a 46-year-old Ayurveda doctor finally decided to change their mind, after several counselling sessions by judicial officers and counsellors.While the man, a BPharma graduate, runs a pharmacy, his wife was running a clinic adjacent to the pharmacy. However, after several years of their marriage, serious differences of opinion arose between the couple. It is learnt that the wife was keeping her earnings in fixed deposits, in the name of her daughters, which her husband did not like. Many other reasons also compelled the couple to take a decision to live separately, in October last year. The woman and her children went to Siddapura in Udupi district, and thereafter filed a plea before the authority, seeking maintenance, assistance for her children’s education and other expenses. After going through her application, the DLSA asked the couple to visit the office in the District Court Complex. Principal district and sessions judge and chairman DLSA B Muralidhara Pai, member secretary Prithviraj Vernekar and others conducted the counselling sessions. They were told about the benefits of living together for themselves and their children. The judicial officers also enlightened them on the ways available to lead a life of contenment.

---||Meerut||Bijnor admin promotes production of organic jaggery in villages along Ganga banks to prevent pesticide use||Bijnor: The Bijnor district administration is securing orders from different states for the supply of organic jaggery to encourage sugarcane farmers to adopt organic farming. The main purpose is to dissuade the farmers located on the Ganga banks to give up pesticides that eventually pollute the river, said officials. The National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) or Namami Gange had initiated a project for organic farming in villages along the Ganga, from its source in Gangotri to Gangasagar in West Bengal, to curb the river pollution, they said. In Bijnor district, all 46 villages are engaged in organic farming. According to a district administration estimate, in the current year, around 4,17,250 quintals of cane, spread over 884 hectares, is expected to be harvested, which will produce 50,070 quintals of jaggery. Notably, there are more than 800 kolhus producing jaggery in the district which is also known as UP’s sugar bowl. Besides, the government has selected Bijnor’s jaggery under the One District One Product scheme. According to officials, organic jaggery is produced by mixing sesame, dry ginger, groundnut, turmeric, sunflower seeds, etc. Buoyed by the prospect of promoting various organic products, especially jaggery, made in the district at the national level, district magistrate Umesh Mishra inaugurated a brand, “Apna Beej Apna Swad Apni Kheti Apna Khaad”, for the agrarians growing various organic products for the supply. “Organic products, especially organic jaggery, produced under the Namami Gange project in the district are in high demand not only in Uttar Pradesh but also in the NCR (National Capital Region) and other states. We have received an order of 27 quintals of organic jaggery from Madhya Pradesh,” said Mishra. Talking to TOI, joint director of agriculture, Moradabad Commissionary, JP Chaudhary said, “Most of the farmers burn crop residues in their fields that cause pollution. Besides, the use of excessive pesticides and chemicals impact the organic carbon or humus in the soil in a bad way. According to a soil testing report, earlier, there was 0.8% humus in the soil, which has now dipped to 0.2%. The health of the soil is deteriorating and, in turn, spoiling human health. If farmers stop burning stubble, the humus in the soil will improve. Besides, organic farming will not only make soil fertile but also make people healthy.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/bijnor-admin-promotes-production-of-organic-jaggery-in-villages-along-ganga-banks-to-prevent-pesticide-use/articleshow/88719142.cms||Harveer Dabas

Even though the chief minister has the legal right to further extend the suspension period, he did not do so to protect his most trusted officer. “This has been done even before the court acquitted him of charges levelled against him in the gold smuggling case. This signals the unholy nexus the chief minister has with the accused in the gold smuggling case. Sivasankar is still the accused in the cases registered by customs and ED. The chief minister should not have reinstated him back in service,” said Chennithala. The government is giving a message that the people involved in the gold smuggling case are well protected, and now the government will reinstate another accused Swapna Suresh also into service, he alleged. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/cm-wants-to-protect-sivasankar-chennithala/articleshow/88719778.cms||---

In total, it has filled 98% seats, and only 16 seats have gone vacant, out of 926 approved seats.NITK Surathkal had been witnessing many seats going vacant in the past, but the situation has improved in the last three years. “This year it has filled 98% of seats, with increased intake of girl students under supernumerary seats,” said Vidya Shetty K,dean, (academics), NITK, Surathkal. In 2018, the ministry of education had decided to improve the gender ratio at the engineering colleges to at least 20%, or one woman out of every five students by 2020. “NITK Surathkal reached the 20% mark last academic year, and it crossed 20% this year. All the seats were filled after sixth rounds of Joint Seat Allocation Authority (JoSAA) and Central Seat Allocation Board special rounds,” said Vidya. However, Direct Admission of Students Abroad (DASA) 2021 has seen a dip this year. Vidya said out of 111 approved seats, only 67 seats are filled. Earlier, Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) scores were considered for DASA, but from this academic year, only JEE Main scores are accepted for admissions. As a result, there is a dip, since not everyone has appeared for the entrance test. Most of the DASA admissions are from overseas citizens of India (OCI).

The Nashik unit of the Public Works Department (PWD) had proposed the replacement of the bridge in the year 2018 after its foundation was found to be unsafe due to the illegal sand mining around its base. MLA Dileep Bankar, who represents the Niphad assembly constituency, said, “The state government has given its approval for the construction of the bridge. This will help the villagers reach Pune or travel towards Agra as the bridge forms a major connecting road between the two highways. Even the heavy vehicles would be able to drive through the new bridge easily,” Bankar said.The height of the new bridge is expected to be a bit more than the existing one as the bridge at present gets inundated during the floods or after water is released from Gangapur Dam and Darna Dam – upstream. Due to this, the Saikheda village gets disconnected from Nashik-Aurangabad highway across the river. According to the PWD officials, another reason for increasing the height of the new bridge is the safety of the road users. The officials said that post administrative approval, the government will soon sanction the funds following which, the tenders would be floated. “It is likely that in the next three months, the formalities will be over and the work order for construction will be given. The construction could take around 18 months,” the officer added. This bridge will be a relief for the farmers from Saikheda and Sinnar as they would be able to easily connect with the agriculture market committees at Lasalgaon and Vinchur for their regular needs.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/state-govt-nod-for-rebuilding-50-yr-old-bridge-at-saikheda/articleshow/88721995.cms||---

Municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav has directed the health department of the civic body to start monitoring patients under home isolation. NMC’s medical superintendent Bapusaheb Nagargoje said they are in the process of deploying teams at divisional level. Moreover, the NMC is also introducing the ‘Mahakavach’ app it had introduced during the second wave to monitor patients under home isolation.“We are also in the process of deploying teams of officials at divisional level to keep an eye on the patients under home isolation in the city,” said Nagargoje.“It is not possible to keep an eye on every patient under home isolation manually. Hence, we are taking the help of the Mahakavach app to ensure that the patients under home isolation do not go to market places until their period of home isolation is over. This app will be introduced shortly,” he added.The NMC had used the same mobile application during the second wave of the Covid pandemic last year. All those who have been put under home isolation will have to download this application on their mobile phones. In Mahakavach app, a geo-fencing of the patient is done and the administration will get an alert in case the patient under home isolation crosses the area marked through geo-fencing.Over 80% of the total patients in the city are asymptomatic or with mild symptoms and they are being isolated at homes. Hence, the number of patients under home isolation in Nashik city has increased from 50 to 722 patients during the last week. The NMC has thus decided to keep an eye on the patients under home isolation so that they do not infect others.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/nmc-to-keep-an-eye-on-patients-under-home-isolation/articleshow/88722000.cms||---

Pramod Wagh, superintendent of the jail, said the convicts and undertrials were released on backdrop of the threat of the spread of Covid-19 in the state and the country.Jail officials said that along with the release of these inmates, they have ensured that the virus does not get a chance to be inside the jail premises ever since pandemic broke out. Wagh saida series of measures were taken as per government guidelines to stop the infection. “After the outbreak of the pandemic in March 2020, the facility of letting relatives meet their imprisoned family members or friends was stopped temporarily. The inmates were, however, given 10 minutes to make audio or video calls to their family members twice a week. This helped to keep them relaxed,” said Wagh.The facility of kin visiting the inmates was restarted from November 2021.Moreover, initially when new prisoners arrived at the Nashik Road Jail, they are mandatorily kept in a temporary prison set up in a school adjoining to the jail for 21 days. Later, this period was reduced to 15 days. Now, they are kept at the temporary facility for a week, before admitting them inside the jail. As on October 2021, all the prisoners in the jail were given both the doses of vaccine and the process is underway as and when the prisoners arrive. Owing to this, not a single inmate was found positive of Covid-19 in the jail. “Those who were found positive at the time of their admission were treated and quarantined before they were admitted inside the prison,” said jail officials.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/1500-jail-inmates-released-on-parole-bail-in-pandemic/articleshow/88722002.cms||---

---||Allahabad||SP hoarding against BJP sets political temp soaring in city||Prayagraj: A hoarding put up by a Samajwadi Party (SP) leader, cl;aiming “Fark Saaf Hai – Bhajapa Saaf Hai’ (difference is clear, BJP is gone),” has set the political temperature soaring here ahead of the 2022 Uttar Pradesh assembly elections due this year, while also setting the ball rolling for a hoarding war between two the arch rivals — SP and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).Youth SP leader Sandeep Yadav installed the hoarding at Subhash Chauraha in the heart of the city to give a befitting reply to BJP’s much-hyped hoarding with title “Fark saaf hai” and also to woo the attention of the voters. The SP hoarding has drawn fresh battle-lines between the two arch rivals and leaders from both the parties were not hesitating to level charges against each other. The hoarding, carrying two pictures with the title — “2017 ke pahle and 2017 ke baad (before and after 2017)” and “Fark saaf hai – Bhajapa saaf hai’, has raised political heat in the Sangam city. The hoarding mentions ‘2017 ke pahle’, showing former chief minister Akhilesh Yadav distributing laptops among 18 lakh students and ‘2017 ke baad’ showing ‘Hathras ki beti ko kerosene se jalaya (Hathras daughter burnt alive)’’ and ‘Mahila ka cheerharan (women disrobed)’. Talking to TOI, Sandeep Yadav, state vice-president of Samajwadi Yuvjan Sabha said, “BJP was constantly making attempts to malign the image of SP among people of the state by levelling baseless allegations. I have installed this hoarding to give a befitting reply to the ruling BJP.”He said that BJP had done nothing for the people of the state and its leaders are fooling them in the name of development. SP leaders also slammed BJP over its hoardings under the theme of “Fark Saaf Hai” and accused the ruling party of misleading people over development and religion. Countering the charge, BJP leaders said the SP leaders have lost their cool after sensing defeat in the forthcoming assembly polls. Senior BJP leader and state co-convener (Media) Ashish Gupta told TOI, “People of the state are well aware about the deteriorating law and order situation in the state before 2017. Two slogans — ‘Khali plot hamara hai (empty plot is mine)’ and ‘Jis gadi mai laga Sapa ka jhanda, usme baitha hai ek gunda (Vehicles with SP flag carry goons)’ — were common before the 2017.” He added, “After the BJP came to power in the state after 2017, mafia elements and goons are cooling their heels behind bars and thus we claim ‘fark saaf hai’.” Meanwhile, Akhilesh Yadav also tweeted that “BJP government has disappointed the people after turning Sangam city as capital of unemployed where once youngsters (aspirants) across the country used to arrive to make preparations to get jobs”. He also referred to Tuesday’s night incident where youths took out a march, claiming youths have made it clear that BJP would be wiped out from the state as they (unemployed youths) took out a march while beating thali (plate) and tali (clap).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/sp-hoarding-against-bjp-sets-political-temp-soaring-in-city/articleshow/88722008.cms||---

In order to provide a smooth running of these ambulances, an agreement was entered between the state government with the service provider companies whose purpose was to run the ambulances through centralized call centers and also provide manpower, including driver and technical staff.In the petition, it was stated that in case of spread of Covid-19 pandemic, there may be requirement of ambulance staff for twenty four hours and in order to maintain shift of eight hours, there is need of around 27,090 drivers and technical staff each for running 102 and 108 ambulances every day. However, only 6,000 drivers and technicians are hired by the service provider company.During the course of hearing, the counsel for the petitioner argued that during the second wave of the pandemic, many ambulance drivers got infected and were quarantined for 14 days. If such a situation arises again state government and service providers must ensure sufficient numbers of staff to ensure proper ambulance service in the state.The petitioner requested that for each ambulance, at least three drivers and three technical staff must be appointed for their regular shift of eight hours as any shift of more than eight hours will increase the risk of accident, mishap, etc., due to overburden on drivers and technical staff.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/hc-seeks-info-from-govt-onstate-ambulance-drivers-staff/articleshow/88722011.cms||---

The state had not taken industry bodies into confidence before making the curfew announcement. People have been suffering due to losses and the fresh curfew was like salt on the wound, he said.Ajay, a textile shop owner from Raichur, said, “In the first and second lockdowns we lost business. During peak seasons, no events were allowed and when the economy opened up, trade was slow because of shortage of money in the hands of people. In the last four months, trade was improving, but again the state is imposing a curfew. Many owners are in debt to pay the salaries of employees and how can the state expect us to do business on Saturday or Sunday when people’s movement is restricted.”Auto drivers, street vendors, textile businessmen, hoteliers and others are now questioning the logic of this measure at a time when many are partially vaccinated. The business community that was on the path of recovery is fretting about going off track yet again losing trade.Sangliyana, an auto driver from Yadgir, said a large section of people are dependent on day-to-day businesses and weekend curfew will simply rob them of income. The auto drivers like him, he stressed, are dependent on daily income and with curfew in place how can someone expect to get passengers. After the government imposed a night curfew, people prefer to return home earlier than usual, he said.He further said the union and state governments should find an alternative like invigorating health infrastructure to deal with hospitalisation, instead continuing with the same old measures.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/traders-are-upset-with-weekend-curfew-in-state/articleshow/88722016.cms||Shreyas HS

The state government has mandated double dose certificate and RT-PCR negative report to those entering Karnataka from other states. These guidelines apply to all modes of travel. Police have already set up 28 check-posts manned by their personnel and other officials in various transit points. However, deploying men at every entry point demands more staff which the department cannot afford at this juncture. To tide with the prevailing situation, the department has roped in several villagers who will work as informants to police on day-to-day cross border movements. The district police have taken this measure after chief minister Basavaraj Bommai directed to increase the number of manned check-posts across the border, especially in rural pockets where some routes are used to secretly enter the state. It should be noted that despite strict vigilance by the authorities, several people are allegedly making inroads from the neighbouring state ducking surveillance. About 28 check-posts at the borders will run round the clock with cops working in shifts to track the movement of commuters. From past 3-4 days hundreds of vehicles were sent back for failing comply with the revised Covid-19 guidelines. Belagavi SP Laxman Nimbaragi told TOI that locals chosen by police will work mostly in the daytime. “These men know several entry points in their villages. The locals are instructed to feed information about people entering the state. The locals will be at play in areas apart from existing check-posts. The local police will also make frequent visits to the villages,” he said. “Public participation will help the border district in a big way to contain the spread of Covid-19. Besides this will also help generate some sense of awareness in the rural pockets,” he opined.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/cops-rope-in-locals-to-monitortraffic-at-maha-border-villages/articleshow/88722017.cms||Shreyas HS

As state government has declared a weekend curfew, Congress corporators led by Altaf Hallur, president, Hubballi-Dharwad Congress and Rajat Ulagadimath, president, Vidyanagar Block Congress, on Wednesday morning visited KIMS and discussed with medical superintendent Dr Arun Kumar and other authorities. They also visited some wards. Ullagaddimath said, “During the visit, the hospital authorities were reluctant to take us to wards which they claimed to have been prepared for the patients. Later when we insisted that they take us, they took us to the Vedanta unit, where they said they prepared it for 200 patients. It was in a very bad state, the unit was full of dust, spiders and other pests.” “We support the government's move to curtail the spread of Covid-19, but the government should take extra care and look at the preparations. KIMS is the lifeline of North Karnataka, but yet it is not prepared to face the third wave of Covid and Omicron,” he added.

However, the bridge is now being reconstructed, much to the relief of regular travellers. The bridge is now closed for a month, and commuters are having to take a detour – while those coming to Dharwad from Belagavi or Goa and took Kalghatgi Road will now be diverted to take the NH-4 bypass near Kelgeri, those heading to the bridge from Dharwad will have to travel along the Kalyan Nagar-Sriramnagar-Kalghatgi Road..Travellers from Dharwad can also use the Gandhinagar-Someshwar Temple-Kalghatgi Road. Unfortunately, the authorities concerned had not taken steps to reinforce the roads being used while the bridge is closed for traffic to bear the additional load. Some of the streets that traffic has now been diverted along are not asphalted, and the movement of heavy vehicles has kicked up a lot of dust, adding to the frustration of the commuters.In addition to the motorists, the clouds of dust hovering on these roads has left the residents of Tejaswi Nagar, Girinagar, Gandhi Nagar, Siddarth Layout and SDM Engineering College understandably upset. Consequently, the residents are forced to keep their windows closed for the better part of the day lest the dust invade their homes.Residents and motorists alike are upset with the authorities for failing to plan ahead, and not inspecting the condition of the roads before diverting traffic. Venturing into these dusty roads has become a rather hazardous exercise for the elderly and children, who are seized by bouts of coughing inhaling the dust. Consequently, many have deemed it safer to stay inside their homes lest their health aggravate. Residents pointed out that neither officials of the Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation (HDMC) nor the elected representatives had visited the area to take stock of the situation, or listen to their grievances.Eateries on these roads are finding it difficult to operate since the dust often settles on their delicacies, resulting in customers becoming apprehensive about visiting the establishments. HDMC officials, meanwhile, said that the bridge would be reopened to traffic within a week.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/dusty-roads-upset-motorists-residents/articleshow/88722023.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh municipal corporation polls: 11 women councillors first timers||CHANDIGARH: Thirteen women have won in the recent held municipal corporation (MC) election, against the 12 reserved seats. Barring two women municipal councillors, none of them served as councillor earlier, and do not have political background. Though four newly elected women municipal councillors are the wives of former municipal councillors, who are also active politicians, except for Harpreet Kaur Babla, nobody has anything to do with the politics and they had contested the election due to reservation of seats in women category. Gurbax Rawat, who won the election third time consecutively on Congress ticket is the only women, who is holding the significant experience of the councillorship by remaining a councillor for 10 years — and now again for next five years. Besides that, Babla was also elected as councillor once. Three elected councillors — Sarabjit Kaur, Vimla Dubey and Darshna — are the wives of former deputy mayors Jagtar Singh and Anil Kumar Dubey and municipal councillors Gurcharan Dass respectively. Out of these 13 newly elected women councillors, seven are first timers representing Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), while four were originally from Congress, but Babla shifted to Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). AAP is leading in the women’s reserved seats. Significantly, out of 35 wards, 13 wards, which is over one third, have been clinched by the women candidates and except one all are new, therefore it will be now crucial to see their overall role in the MC and its functioning. Moreover, in this five-year term, two mayor terms are for women candidates, their responsibility become more crucial to run the civic body. A senior party leader of the AAP said, “Of the 35 elected councillors, majority of them are first timers. In this case, the responsibility of the senior leaders of the party will be huge. We have to work hard from the outside, at least in the initial years to guide councillors.” A senior BJP leader too said, “The main responsibility will be on officers to make the new councillors aware about rules. We are hopeful that with the passage of time, they will learn things.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/mc-polls-11-women-councillors-1st-timers/articleshow/88722027.cms||Deepak Yadav
---||Delhi||Delhi: Cops to list drug hotspots, crack whip||NEW DELHI: Ordering a concerted and time-bound crackdown on the drug menace in the city, Delhi Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana on Wednesday issued instructions to identify hotspots, increase surveillance and escalate action against drug traffickers. Asthana is learnt to have laid down a 10-point action plan elaborating the strategy and its execution to work towards curbing the sale and supply of narcotics. Action would be taken under PIT-NDPS against the top 100 traffickers, including attaching their assets and financial investigation of cartels and its members. Union home minister Amit Shah had convened a high-level meeting on Monday to review the prevailing threat scenario and security challenges, including narco-terror. Last week, Shah had also chaired the third apex level meeting of Narco Coordination Centre to implement plans to make India drug-free. Asthana’s order was to ensure implementation of what was deliberated in that meeting, sources said. “In the campaign against drugs, police station-wise hotspots will be identified and action taken against such activities and perpetrators of the crime. The narcotics cell of Crime Branch has already identified 15 hotspots,” Asthana said. The list of 192 hotspots conveyed by Delhi government, citing a study conducted by them through AIIMS, would also be examined. The list of hotspots and action taken by local police would be sent to DCP/Crime (Narcotics). All districts and specialised units would take effective action against drug traffickers in a time-bound manner to destroy the supply chain, the order stated. Action against 85 major drug traffickers would also be initiated. The list was circulated by the narcotics cell among the districts for action on December 6. “Leading drug traffickers within and outside Delhi who have supply links will be identified and legal action taken against the 100 top drug traffickers. They will be put under close surveillance and action taken within the next two months,” said Asthana. Investigating officers were asked to conduct an in-depth probe of cases to bust the entire chain/network of drug supply. DCPs would personally supervise the investigations. “Financial Investigation under Section 68 of NDPS Act shall be carried out for identification and seizure of assets. Provisions envisaged in PIT-NDPS Act will be used against the top drug traffickers to be identified by DCPs within two months. The help of narcotics cell may be taken for making suitable proposals against such drug traffickers, whether they are based in Delhi or outside,” stated the order. Asthana has sought reactivation of the anti-narcotics squads of the districts and asked DCPs to monitor them on a weekly basis. The order also sought action, including deportation of foreign nationals found involved in drug trafficking. The narcotics cell under additional commissioner Chinmoy Biswal has been tasked to investigate cases and also coordinate with Narcotics Control Bureau and Directorate of Revenue Intelligence each fortnight or month. An action taken report on the order has been sought from the officers within a month.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/cops-to-list-drug-hotspots-crack-whip/articleshow/88719801.cms||Raj Shekhar
---||Nagpur||Rs6cr contracts for barricading went to 16 NMC contractors without any tender||Nagpur: Citing Covid-19 pandemic, nine out of the ten Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) zones engaged 16 contractors without floating tenders to do barricading works at containment zones during the first wave between March and December 2020. The contractors have reportedly submitted bills of Rs6 crore for the barricading work, which could have been reportedly executed for less than Rs1 crore had the civic body procured and used the materials as is done in other works. Also, the civic body could have utilized the materials in second and next waves, or for any other purposes later. This is the sixth such case to come to fore in NMC in last 23 days, where contractors have raked in the moolah in nexus with officials and caused financial loss to the cash-strapped civic body. NMC standing committee chairman Prakash Bhoyar confirmed contractors submitted bills of Rs6 crore for erecting barricades for containment zones. “We kept the proposal pending and will discuss it in next meeting of standing committee. We will direct an inquiry in this case. Payments will be disbursed in case works were really done,” he said. NMC sources told TOI the standing committee had given post facto approval to release payment to contractors a few months ago. “Contracts were given to 16 contractors without any tender. Therefore, standing committee gave post facto approval. Payments of Rs1.5 crore of total Rs6 crore were released a couple of months ago. There is need of re-appropriation to release remaining payment. Therefore, proposal has been tabled before standing committee,” sources said. Shockingly, now standing committee is thinking of inquiry despite having given approval a few months ago. There is no provision in Maharashtra Municipal Corporations (MMC) Act to give contracts to contractors without tender or quotation. Contracts can be given in case of emergency works subject to intimation by administration to standing committee and general body. BJP city president Pravin Datke, also MLC, said, “No intimation was given by administration to standing committee and general body for these contracts. NMC procured various types of materials during first wave. When it came to barricading, tins and bamboos were erected on rental basis. Same contractor used the same materials in another containment zone after removing them from earlier containment zone.” He added the works could have been done within Rs1 crore had NMC procured these materials. Therefore, inquiry into these contracts should also be done by committee constituted under ruling party leader Avinash Thakre to conduct probe into Bogus Contracts scam, he demanded. Gandhibagh zone, which took care of barricading Mominpura and adjacent areas for a long period, did not spend a single penny on these works. “The zone used tins and bamboos available with it for other works and also those seized during anti-encroachment drives. The committee should also probe reason behind other nine zones spending Rs6 crore instead of following Gandhibagh zone,” he said. The bills for work during second wave are yet to be submitted by the contractors. Congress city president Vikas Thakre said, “I have demanded an inquiry by the state government into all contracts. NMC made people panic about Covid-19 and worked to benefit contractors. Fine example is Pandhrabodi containment zone. One person tested positive, after being admitted in GMCH. An area of 4km radius was barricaded only to benefit contractors. People were put to harassment as they could not get fresh vegetables, milk and other daily items. It is a criminal offence so all concerned should be booked.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/rs6cr-contracts-for-barricading-went-to-16-nmc-contractors-without-any-tender/articleshow/88719808.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

Taking its team to the Himachal Pradesh capital is cited as another part of the strategy of the saffron party for the mayoral election.Sources in the BJP said barring a couple of councillors, all left for Shimla on Tuesday night. They are likely to return a day before the election. The BJP has remained the ruling party in the MC for six years and has the same number of votes as AAP in the general house. A fear to keep its councillors here in the city shows how crucial the election has become for the parties.“Our newly-elected councillors left for Shimla on Tuesday night. They will come back soon. A couple of people did not go due to their personal engagement. We are sure we will clinch all the seats of the election scheduled to be held on Saturday,” sources in the BJP said.With both AAP and BJP tied at equal number of votes, both are adopting different ways to win the election as Congress has decided to abstain from the proceedings. This makes the role of the lone Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) Hardeep Singh candidate all the more crucial.On the other hand, all AAP candidates had returned the city from Delhi on Tuesday and accompanied its candidates who filed the nomination papers for the three seats mayor, senior deputy mayor and deputy mayor.The seven Congress councillors are still holidaying in Rajasthan. “since we have decided to abstain from the election, or councillors will come back on Saturday”, sources in the Congress said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/bjp-councillors-chill-out-in-shimla-to-dodge-mayoral-election-heat/articleshow/88722035.cms||Deepak Yadav

---||Rajkot||Rising costs crack Morbi’s ceramic units||Rajkot: Around 800 ceramic factories in and around Morbi are facing an uncertain future. Constant rise in prices of gas, coal and raw materials have seen as many as 100 units shutting down in the last few months.“Around 100 more units are on the verge of closing down by the end of this month due to rise in input cost,” said Mukesh Ughareja, former president of Morbi Ceramic Association. Industry players are blaming overstocking due to rise in product prices and liquidity crunch for closing down of the units.According to the industry association, earlier the gas usage of Morbi units was around 65 lakh standard cubic metres (SCM) per day. Currently, it has come down to 55 lakh SCM due to the closure of units. The ceramic sector, which was already struggling due to high freight and container charges, has been hit hard by increase in gas prices, which have doubled in the last six months.The rise in input cost has also badly affected the export volumes. Since the last three months, the export is down by almost 25%. As the domestic market demand is not high enough, units are facing the problem of overstock.Morbi’s yearly export is worth Rs 13,000 crore which was projected to touch Rs 15,000 crore this year. But if the current situation continues till the end of the year, exports won’t cross Rs 11,000 crore, experts fear.The rise in prices of gas and other raw materials has led to an increase in production cost by as much as 30% which is making it difficult for Morbi manufacturers to compete in the international market. The European countries and China are eating into India’s business, sources said. Nilesh Jetpariya, president of Morbi ceramic industry, said that the rise in input cost is putting strain on ties between manufacturers and buyers. “We are forced to differ from our commitment of supply because we can’t afford the price at which we had booked the order,” Jetpariya said.An industrialist who does not wish to be named said that the government too is at fault. “The government is laying red carpet for the industries from other states in the vibrant Gujarat summit. If they take care of the existing industries we will be able to compete in the international market and also provide employment to the local population.”The industry requires coal for the spray dryer process which is essential for all the units except those making sanitary tiles. “The imported coal is not coming from Indonesia and Gujarat government’s company is providing only 50% of the sanctioned quota of lignite,” Ughareja added.The industry wants the state government to control the gas prices and provide a full quota of lignite coal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/rising-costs-crack-morbis-ceramic-units/articleshow/88722051.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

---||Rajkot||Metal nut removed from 4-year-old boy’s nose in Rajkot||RAJKOT: Four-year-old boy Monit Joshi from Rajkot got a new lease of life after doctors removed a metal nut stuck in his nostril. Mohit was brought to the hospital two weeks ago with a 1cm-wide metal nut stuck in his right nostril. He had accidentally put the bolt inside his nose. He was having trouble breathing as there was narrow space for air to pass. Also, doctors said that the metal nut was too close to the nasal cavity. “If the nut had slipped into the nasal cavity, it would have endangered the child’s life,” said ENT specialist Dr Himanshu Thakar, who removed the bolt endoscopically. Though the incident occurred two weeks ago, the doctors disclosed the information on Wednesday after keeping Monit under observation. After doctors were sure that the child was completely safe, they disclosed the case details. “If the nut had gone further inside, the patient could have died. Or, during removal if he had started bleeding, it would create more problems,” said Thakar. “Metal nut was 1cm-wide and the chances of complication was very high. However, without any surgery we could remove it endoscopically,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/metal-nut-removed-from-four-year-old-boys-nose/articleshow/88722054.cms||---
