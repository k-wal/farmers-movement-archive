New reforms, policy assistance and support mechanisms for establishing a focused approach in solving unmet financial needs through technology will significantly benefit the economy, they stressed. "We've seen a substantial spike in the adoption of digital payments in the last one year. I'm hoping that in the upcoming Budget, the government will think of alternatives to the Zero MDR (merchant discount rate) policy, as that will help promote e-payments and drive significant digital adoption among businesses," said Harshil Mathur, CEO and Co-founder, Razorpay. In last year's budget, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced Rs 1,500 crore to further accelerate digital payments' growth in the country. Mathur said that it would also be desirable for the government to increase contribution to the Fund of Funds for Startups (FFS). "Hassle-free loan disbursements, automation of tax and compliance, paper-less approvals, and incentives to adopt digital banking practices will also be welcome changes that can support the growth of MSMEs," he added. To incentivise startups, the government had last year extended the eligibility for claiming tax holidays for startups by a year to March 31, 2022. It also extended the capital gains exemption for investment in startups by a year to March 31, 2022, to boost funding. The country has also seen numerous startups incentivising their employees in the past year with buying back ESOPs. "Deferring tax payments when exercising the option, plus waiving tax for some ESOP receipts, will also be a laudable change in the new budget," said Mathur. According to Ravish Naresh, CEO and Co-founder, Khatabook, they are hoping for a progressive Budget, especially aimed at promoting homegrown startups focused on problem-solving for India. "New reforms, policy assistance, and support mechanisms for establishing a focused approach in solving unmet financial needs through technology will significantly benefit the economy," Naresh told IANS. "In addition, the government's continued focus on enhancing digital infrastructure in the country will ensure progress towards equality in digital access in FY22-23," he added. In the last year's Budget, the government had said it will facilitate setting up of a world-class fintech hub in Gujarat International Finance Tec (GIFT) city. The government also proposed a portal to collect relevant information on gig workers to help formulate social security schemes for them. Vidit Aatrey, Founder and CEO of homegrown social commerce platform Meesho, said that a singular focus on augmenting offline MSMEs with online distribution could be a game-changing economic transformation opportunity. "We would like to see the government focus on policies that will create a level playing field for offline and online sellers with less than Rs 40 lakh turnover," Aatrey told IANS. "Simplifying GST compliance requirements for online sellers will also enable millions of small businesses to leverage the potential of e-commerce and contribute to India's growing digital economy," he added. In addition to this, the startups hope that the government incentivises capital formation in the area of logistics and cold chains through policies and infrastructure development. Akash Gupta, co-founder and CEO, Zypp Electric, said that they are optimistic that the government will announce new initiatives to encourage local EV manufacturing, facilitate easy finance and create an innovative EV ecosystem. "We urge the government to reduce GST on EV purchases and rentals from 5 per cent to 2 per cent. A reduced GST would allow consumers to smoothly shift to EV," Gupta told IANS. Startups raised a record $24.1 billion in 2021, a two-fold increase over pre-Covid levels, while $6 billion were raised via public markets with 11 startup IPOs, a Nasscom-Zinnov report said last week. The Indian tech startup base continues to witness steady growth, adding over 2,250 startups in 2021, which is 600 more than 2020.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2022-startups-seek-friendly-policies-tax-incentives/articleshow/89080139.cms||---

The arrests were made by police teams from different districts and Uttar Pradesh Special Task Force (UP STF). While as many as 17 persons were arrested from Prayagraj, five from Ambedkarnagar, three from Meerut, one each were held from Kannauj, Amethi, Gonda, Pratapgarh, Mathura, Moradabad, Jaunpur and Sultanpur. Additional Director General of police, law and order, Prashant Kumar, said that police were keeping a vigil on the conduct of the TET examination since Saturday night and based on specific inputs arrests were made from different places. Kumar said that the majority of arrested persons were solvers, trying to take the exam in the place of original candidates. Two candidates, one each from Amethi, Kannauj, were found to be using ‘bluetooth’ devices to cheat in the examination. "In Gonda, police held one youth who was trying to spread misinformation about the TET examination on social media," said the officer. Police also recovered a huge cache of admit cards, Rs 70,000 cash and a few Aadhaar cards. ADG also said that all those arrested belonged to different gangs spread across the state. "The gang leaders used to take money and assure selection to the candidates," he said. In Ambedkar Nagar, the arrested person Jhinku Prajapati, is said to be the mastermind of a gang who assured selection of candidates at the cost of Rs 3 lakh. "Candidates had paid Jhinku Rs1 lakh advance, and rest were to be given after the selection," said SP, Ambedkar Nagar, Alok Priyadarshi.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/in-crackdown-across-uttar-pradesh-33-held-for-bid-to-rig-uptet/articleshow/89080489.cms||---
---||India||Community transmission of Omicron on, says Insacog||NEW DELHI: Omicron is now at the ‘community transmission’ stage in India with hospitalisation and ICU admissions rising, though most cases of the new Covid-19 infections have been mild or asymptomatic, according to genomics consortium Insacog. “Omicron has become dominant in multiple metros where new cases have been rising exponentially,” Insacog (Indian SARS-COV2 Genomics Sequencing Consortium), jointly initiated by the Union health ministry and the department of biotechnology along with with CSIR and ICMR, noted in its weekly bulletin dated January 10 and released this Sunday. “The threat level remains unchanged,” it added. The health ministry has not used the term ‘community transmission’ to describe the spread of Covid-19 infections in India since 2020. During the second wave powered by the Delta variant, the Centre had maintained the situation of Covid-19 spread was not same all over the country as there had been local outbreaks in clusters with different patterns in different areas. According to WHO, ‘community transmission’ is a state when larger outbreaks of local transmission are experienced which can be defined through an assessment of factors including large numbers of cases which cannot be linked to transmission chains, large numbers of cases from sentinel lab surveillance or increasing positive, tests through sentinel samples (routine systematic testing of respiratory samples from established laboratories), and multiple unrelated clusters in several areas of the country or territory or area.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/community-transmission-of-omicron-on-says-insacog/articleshow/89080476.cms||Sushmi Dey

Officials in the know say the transition is going to happen “very soon”, with the earliest target being by the month-end. The board of AirAsia India (AAIPL), in which Tatas hold 83.7% stake, will meet on Monday. While the agenda could not be ascertained, the first merger will be of AAIPL and AI Express as a low cost carrier. Air India and Vistara (51% owned by Tatas and 49% by Singapore Airline, or SIA) will continue to operate as separate full service carrier (FSC) till SIA agrees to have a merged FSC. “Things (have been) sorted (out). Closing very soon,” top government sources told TOI on Sunday when asked if the decision of Devas Multimedia shareholders despite the Supreme Court recently winding up the company will delay AI’s handover. “We have already entered liens or obtained seizure and garnishment orders on tens of millions of dollars in Indian state assets. We will continue to identify and seize state assets wherever we find them until India returns in good faith to the negotiating table,” a spokesperson for Devas Multimedia said Sunday. Meanwhile, AI officials say Tata Group has begun a “train the trainer” program under which some people have been selected from various departments to be trained about the Tata ethos, work culture. The trained will, in turn, train their colleagues. “One key thing being told is that unlike a PSU where seniority decides who will be the boss, AI employees should be prepared to work under someone who could be younger than them,” said an official. The Tatas have so far not commented on takeover preparations or plans for the airline founded by JRD Tata 69 years ago. “The transition period is likely to see someone from Tata coming in as the accountable manager and senior AI officials continuing to work in their current roles barring a few changes in no-operational side. The Tata-appointed brass will need some time to takeover till they are, first, finalised and announced and, then secondly, given security clearances by government agencies,” said a person in the know. Tata Sons senior VP Nipun Aggarwal — an engineer from Delhi College from Engineering and post graduate in finance & management from IIM Calcutta — is expected to play a key role in AI.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/devas-action-wont-delay-air-india-handover-target-remains-january-end/articleshow/89080561.cms||Saurabh Sinha
---||Delhi||With schools, offices shut, demand for R-Day merchandise remains low in NCR||A week before Republic Day, Delhi markets usually see an influx of Tricolour flags, pins, T-shirts, among other things. Earlier this year, owing to lower COVID cases and limited restrictions, vendors were hoping for a better sale of R-Day merchandise than last year. However, the new restrictions have changed the scene for the sellers. Shopkeepers across NCR say that due to the closure of schools and offices , along with other restrictions on gatherings, the sale of Republic Day merchandise is low this year as well. Some sellers also mention that since there are not many buyers this time, they have kept limited stock. Before Omicron-related restrictions, sellers were hoping for higher sales for Tricolour merchandiseSellers from Delhi’s Sadar Bazaar, Janpath and Sarojini say that while every year they used to sell over a lakh flags, this year they barely have a thousand flags in stock. Since the restrictions were announced, sellers expect lowered sales and have thus kept less stock. Anshu Bhatia, a seller from Sarojini Nagar market, says, “Till last month, we were expecting that sales would be higher this R-Day as compared to last year. Now, that’s not the case. After COVID cases started going up again we didn’t even place new orders.” Hari Shankar, a seller from Janpath, points out, “We have not ordered any new Republic Day merchandise. Before the pandemic, we used to stock Tricolour T-shirts, dupattas, bands and a lot of other smaller items as those used to be in high demand. A week before January 26 and August 15, we used to be quite busy as college students ordered in bulk. Republic Day merchandise required to decorate offices on Barakhamba Road also used to go from here. Ab toh kisi ko pata bhi nahi market kab khula hai, kab band. Log online khareed lete honge.” He says that they will display their old stock, and adds, “We hope that before Jan 26, some of our stock will be sold.” ‘social media influencers are buying tricoloured merchandise’Although many are not hoping for a great sale of Tricolour merchandise, sellers hope that freedom fighter-themed T-shirts may still have some takers. Harinder Singh, who runs a store in Janpath, says, “We have been getting requests for Tricolour merchandise from social media influencers, but not from regular customers. While the Tricolour merchandise sale has gone down, we have also noticed that the sale of T-shirts with themes of freedom fighters, especially Bhagat Singh, still picks up during R-Day and hence we have to keep some of those ready.” He further adds, “While there is a dearth of Tricolour items in shops because we don’t have any takers, people are shopping for flags and other R-Day merchandise at traffic signals.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/with-schools-offices-shut-demand-for-r-day-merchandise-remains-low-in-ncr/articleshow/89078438.cms||Niharika Lal
---||India||Undoing efforts of past to obliterate many heroes: PM Modi||NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Sunday unveiled a hologram of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose at India Gate, putting the legendary hero of the freedom struggle on the same pedestal as Gandhi, Nehru, Patel and Ambedkar. Emphasising that the hologram of Netaji will soon be replaced by a one cast in stone, the PM said that installation of the “giant statue” close to the National War Museum at India Gate and near Parliament marks a “homage to the hero of freedom by the grateful nation and will keep reminding our instititutions and coming generations the lesson of national duty”. Modi said the recognition that Netaji deserved was denied to him. “It is unfortunate that after independence, along with the traditions of country, the contributions of many great personalities were also sought to be erased,” PM Modi said. “The freedom struggle involved ‘tapasya’ of lakhs, but attempt were made to diminish their contributions. But today country is boldly correcting those mistakes,” PM said as he referred to measures such as hoisting of Indian National Army flag, participation of INA contingent in 2018 Republic Day parade, declassification of files and measures to commemorate the INA inside the Red Fort.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/undoing-efforts-of-past-to-obliterate-many-heroes-pm-modi/articleshow/89080648.cms||Dipak K Dash

India prepared for more than two years for the Asian Cup with preparatory tours in Europe, Asia and South America. The hosts did well against Iran in the opener last week and, despite dominating, had to settle for a draw. They were drawn to play Chinese Taipei at the DY Patil stadium in Navi Mumbai on Sunday, but with 12 positive cases and two injuries, India could not gather 13 players – from a registered squad of 23 -- for the match. “Following several positive cases of Covid-19, India failed to name the required minimum of 13 players for the Group A match against Chinese Taipei,” the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) said in a statement late on Sunday. “In accordance with Article 4.1 of the ‘Special Rules Applicable to AFC Competitions during the Covid-19 pandemic’, India was therefore unable to participate in the match and the full provisions of Article 4.1 will apply.” According to Article 4.1, a team which is unable to field 13 players is “held responsible for the match not taking place and shall be considered to have withdrawn from the relevant competition.” India missed two players and two members of the coaching staff for the opener against Iran on January 20. Seven players tested positive a day later inside the bio-secure bubble and three others were also infected on the day of the all-important clash. With two others -- Indumathi Kathiresan and Panthoi Chanu – nursing injuries, the hosts did not have enough players for the second-round clash. India then tried to force a postponement but rules state that it can be granted only in “exceptional circumstances” which Covid-19 positive cases wasn’t. The hosts cannot appeal either as competitions committee decisions are final and binding. The withdrawal is a huge blow for India as the team was looking to make it to the quarterfinals from among 12 participants and then even become the first to qualify for the FIFA Women’s World Cup. “Unfortunately, this happened despite the best measures put in place, and it is sheer bad luck that it happened to us. Let there be no fingers pointed at any. We need to understand this is a pandemic situation, and no bubble is fool proof around the world,” said All India Football Federation (AIFF) president Praful Patel. Several teams like Japan, South Korea, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam have also had Covid-19 positive cases but no team has reported as many as India inside the bubble. “This could have happened to any team, unfortunately it happened to India,” AIFF general secretary Kushal Das told TOI. “The girls were excellent in the opener (against Iran) and are now understandably devastated. We need to support them. They worked so hard and did whatever was asked of them. The AIFF, too, supported wholeheartedly, but Covid ruined everything.” Das said the need of the hour was to keep supporting the girls, rather than adopt a negative approach. “Whatever happened is unfortunate, but I am sure this is only the beginning of far greater days for women’s football. From five years ago till now, we can see massive improvement in their game. We will keep supporting,” said Das. The Women’s Asian Cup will continue as scheduled with the group winners, runners-up and the two best third-placed teams qualifying for the quarterfinals.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/covid-hit-india-unable-to-field-team-forced-out-of-asian-cup-at-home/articleshow/89080764.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Goa||FC Goa, Bengaluru settle for a draw||Sunil Chhetri became the joint top scorer in the Indian Super League after his second-half strike helped Bengaluru FC hold FC Goa 1-1 at the GMC Athletic Stadium, Bambolim, on Sunday. Goa were dominant from the start and took the lead just before the break through an unlikely source as Australian centre-back Dylan Fox headed in the opener. However, Bengaluru responded in the second half and it was none other than captain Chhetri who netted the equaliser with a milestone 48th goal in his 106th appearance. He is now the joint top scorer alongside former Goa star striker Ferran Corominas, who took only 57 matches to get there. A win could have pushed either team in the top half of the table, but they are both on 14 points each. Goa have played 13 games and are ninth while Bengaluru are a spot above and have a game in hand. Both teams were languishing at the bottom of the table and were desperate for a win. Goa had defeated Bengaluru 2-1 in the first leg. Ever since that defeat, Bengaluru had been on a five-match unbeaten run in which they trounced defending champions Mumbai City FC 3-0 in the last game and were then forced indoors due to rising Covid-19 cases. Coach Marco Pezzaiuoli decided to change things around and made three changes. Chhetri was back in the starting line-up after five games on the bench. On the other hand, Goa coach Derrick Pereira had failed to win against NorthEast United FC and SC East Bengal, both teams below them and the pressure was building up. He made four changes after losing 1-2 against East Bengal. Ace midfielder Brandon Fernandes started for the first time this season on the bench after missing 12 games due to injury. Goa had better control of the ball even as their opponents put pressure through Danish Farooq and Roshan Singh. Goa had a glorious chance 10 minutes before the break when Jorge Ortiz found Edu Bedia inside the box but the latter’s header in front of goal sailed over. Fox then came close and finally gave Goa the breakthrough they needed in the 41st minute. Ortiz worked out a corner with Alberto Noguera and crossed the ball at the far post where Fox headed powerfully from close. After the restart, Bengaluru appeared to be on a mission to get something out of this game. They equalised soon after the hour mark when Prince Ibara’s cross sailed over Goa’s defence and landed to Chhetri. The veteran headed in perfectly to make it look easy. Roshan soon stretched Goa keeper Dheeraj for a diving save. The teams went all out for the match-winner in the final quarter with Pereira introducing Brandon with seven minutes to go. Chettri had the best chance in added time but his effort came off the horizontal bar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/fc-goa-bengaluru-settle-for-a-draw/articleshow/89080774.cms||FLAVIO LOPES
---||India||Few followed Mahatma Gandhi’s favourite hymn: Govt||NEW DELHI: The government on Sunday pushed back at the criticism over the removal of Mahatma Gandhi’s favourite “Abide With Me” from the repertoire of the tunes to be played on Beating Retreat, saying that few could understand or relate to the solemn hymn. “Abide With Me” written by Scottish Anglican Henry Francis Lyte in 1847 as he was dying of tuberculosis is a prayer for God to remain with him through life and in death is a very popular military tune, but the lyrics of the song are understood by just a few”, said a source in the wake of all the criticism of the change. Official sources said the hymn has been replaced with “Ae Mere Watan Ke Logon”, the patriotic song that was composed in the wake of defeat in the 1962 war with China and commemorates the sacrifices made by the armed forces. The song, written by Kavi Pradeep and composed by C Ramchandra, was first sung by Lata Mangeshkar in the presence of the then PM Jawaharlal Nehru as the nation reeled under the trauma of the military debacle. “The celebrated song has universal appeal and is an apt tribute to the brave soldiers of our Indian armed forces who have laid down their lives for our nation. The song imbibes a sense of sacrifice and our respect for those who have made sacrifices for our country over the past 75 years,” sources said, adding that Kavi Pradeep’s tribute to the martyrs drawn from different regions also represented the “unity in diversity” feature of nationhood. Sources reiterated that the replacement of “Abide With Me” was part of a process under way for decades where the tunes handed down from the country’s colonial past have been replaced by ones composed here.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/few-followed-mahatma-gandhis-favourite-hymn-govt/articleshow/89080778.cms||---
---||Business||Ahead of 5G rollout, 8 lakh mobile towers to come up||NEW DELHI: Ahead of the rollout of the high-speed 5G network, the government is set to give a massive push to telecom infrastructure across the country with plans to add as many as eight lakh new mobile towers over the next two years — more than double the current strength — apart from ensuring that nearly three out of four are connected through optical fibre to increase their data-carrying capacity. The plans have been discussed with the PMO as the government takes steps to ensure a vastly connected digital environment that can support new-age tech, such as those centred around internet of things, augmented and VR casts, autonomous driving and smart home solutions. The pandemic has shown how digital has become the backbone of our economy, aiding businesses and offices, education and entertainment from home. The government wants adequate enablers to be in place to support the growth of digital infrastructure as internet becomes central to a variety of tasks,” sources told TOI. The push to towers — often at the receiving end of resident welfare associations (RWAs) over radiation concerns — will see their density go up from 0. 4/1,000 population to 1/1,000 population by the end of March 2024. “At present, 6. 8 lakh towers have been installed across the country. More than 15 lakh towers are to be installed by FY24. Consultations will be held with stakeholders to plan a strategy for faster fiberisation,” a source said. Currently, around 34% of the towers have been fiberised in India. The plan is to take this up to 70% by end of March 2024. Experts believe that as spectrum holdings of telecom companies get stronger through regular auctions, the next set of efforts is needed in infrastructure development. “With a robust 5G infrastructure, India will empower innovators to help create new businesses, services and experiences to benefit sectors across domains,” Avishkar Misra, who heads data science at TracFone Wireless, a Verizon subsidiary, said. The government also wants to set up a National Fibre Authority (NFA) on the lines of other regulatory authorities.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ahead-of-5g-rollout-8-lakh-mobile-towers-to-come-up/articleshow/89080925.cms||Pankaj Doval

The SC junked arguments of Devas and its shareholders that since the auditors’ reports of 2012, 2016, 2017 and 2020 certified that “no fraud on or by the company has been noticed or reported during the course of the audit”, the Antrix-Devas deal was terminated not on grounds of fraud. “The auditor’s report can neither be taken as gospel truth nor act as estoppel against the company,” the court said. Writing the judgment, Justice V Ramasubramanian, part of a bench comprising Justice Hemant Gupta, said, “The chartered accountants/auditors are not experts either in criminal law or in the technology that formed the subject matter of the agreement between Antrix and Devas. The statements of the CAs are always qualified with certain riders such as ‘according to the information and explanations given to us in the course of our audit’ or ‘to the best of our knowledge and belief and according to the information and explanations given to us’.” The bench added, “The statement in the auditor’s report is as per the information given to them or as per the information culled out to the best of their ability.” The SC said the CBI registered an FIR for the offences under Section 420 read with Section 120B of the IPC on March 16, 2015, nearly four years after the termination of the deal. “The officers of Antrix as well as government officials were also implicated in the FIR for offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. Therefore, the appellants cannot set up a plea of estoppel on the ground that the termination of the agreement in 2011 was not on the ground of fraud, when the discovery of fraud itself was years later,” it said.  It also rejected the plea against winding up on the ground that even during the ICC arbitration proceedings, Antrix had not taken the plea of fraud. The bench said, “The arbitral proceedings commenced in 2013 and the award itself was passed on September 14, 2015. Antrix cannot be expected to plead fraud in the arbitral proceedings, even before the discovery of fraud.” It took note of ASG N Venkataraman’s argument that all shareholders of Devas have been arrayed as accused by the CBI in the criminal cases. But the CBI has not even been able to serve summons on them, he said. The bench said, “Persons who are avoiding summons in criminal prosecution, cannot be heard to contend they must have been heard in the petition for winding up. Taking advantage of their citizenship/residence abroad, the shareholders are prosecuting proceedings for the enforcement of (i) ICC Arbitral Tribunal Award in India; and (ii) BIT Awards overseas, even while making it impossible for CBI to serve summons for five years.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cas-clean-chit-cant-stall-cos-folding-supreme-court/articleshow/89081004.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||Business||Power plants staring at fresh coal shortage due to ‘bias’||NEW DELHI: Coal shortage at power plants may appear to be over for the time being but the spectre of another crisis is lurking beneath the surface, especially for generation stations located far from mines. But unlike September last year, this time such plants — termed as ‘foreign’ by Indian Railways — are suffering due to discrimination in allotment of rakes and a free-for-all among railway zones in the race to post higher despatch figures. Last week, the Amaravati power plant operated by Rattan India Power Ltd in Maharashtra became the first victim of the situation when it shut down one of its units due to coal shortage resulting from insufficient rake allotment by SECR, the south east central zone of the railways. The power ministry on January 17 issued an office memo seeking details of remedial action taken by the Railways as grumblings from private power plants facing similar situation grew louder, government sources said. Industry sources said L&T’s Nhava and Vedanta’s Talwandi Sabo power plants are among other plants facing similar predicament. These plants could not be contacted immediately. The problem, both government and industry sources said, lies in zones focusing on power plants and mines located within their jurisdiction or the rakes do not have to cross multiple zones. The Railways describes distant power plants as foreign as the rakes have to go across the home zone. The trend is more pronounced in zones with heavy-duty coal lifting such as SECR, which largely services SECL (South Eastern Coalfields Ltd), Coal India Ltd’s largest mine. “The shorter intra-zone haul allows faster turnaround of rakes. This automatically helps zones to improve their loading and despatch figures. There is also another reason. Railway zones are under pressure to show higher despatch figures. For example, in cases where SECL coal has to cross other zones, the empty rakes are commandeered by the other zone on their way back for despatch of coal from WCL (Western Coalfields Ltd) to elsewhere, say the north,” one industry executive said requesting anonymity. The power ministry had in December asked plants to import 10% of their coal requirement to avoid a repeat of last year’s situation when fuel stocks ran precariously low as coal production and despatch was hit by heavy monsoon rains.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/power-plants-staring-at-fresh-coal-shortage-due-to-bias/articleshow/89081086.cms||Sanjay Dutta
---||India||Republic Day march: Army to display evolution of uniform & rifles||NEW DELHI: Marching contingents of Army soldiers will showcase how their uniforms and rifles have evolved since 1950s at the Republic Day parade this year. The mechanised columns will also include “a mix of the vintage and modern” weapon systems and platforms, Delhi area chief of staff Major General Alok Kacker said on Sunday. In the first of the six Army contingents, Rajput Regiment soldiers will be seen wearing the uniform of the 1950s and carrying the vintage Lee-Enfield .303 rifles. They will be followed by Assam Regiment troops donning the uniform from the 1960s along with .303 rifles. The Jammu & Kashmir Light Infantry will be the next marching contingent with the uniform of the 1970s and 7.62mm self-loading rifles. Soldiers of the Sikh Light Infantry and Army Ordnance Corps, in turn, will don the present-day olive green uniforms along with the 5.56mm INSAS (Indian small arms system) rifles. The new combat uniform with a “digital disruptive pattern”, which was unveiled for the first time during the Army Day parade on January 15, in turn, will be worn by the Parachute Regiment commandos with the Israeli Tavor TAR-21 assault rifles. There will be a total of 16 marching contingents. Six from the Army, one each from Navy and IAF, four from the Central Armed Police Forces, one each from the Delhi Police and National Service Scheme, and two from National Cadet Corps , said Maj Gen Kacker. The mechanised columns will include vintage weapons and platforms like Centurion tanks , HT-16 electronic warfare systems and Tiger Cat missile systems to modern ones like Arjun tanks , Taran Shakti systems and Akash surface-to-air missiles.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/republic-day-march-army-to-display-evolution-of-uniform-rifles/articleshow/89081128.cms||---

The incident has sparked resentment among people, who blamed police administration for taking sacrilege incidents lightly. According to reports, a youth, later identified as Gursahib Singh, scaled the wall of ‘Nikka Gurdwara’ in Bhindi Aulakh village, near Ajnala, and broke the donation box but was held by local sangat who thrashed him for attempted sacrilege. Paramjit Singh Akali, one of the five-member Sikh Youth Power of Punjab (SYPP) informed that in a video recorded by sangat, the alleged accused had admitted that he was offered Rs 1 lakh for tearing Sri Guru Granth Sahib (SGGS) by a person whom he identified as ‘Ganna’. However, the youth admitted that he couldn’t dare to disrespect SGGS. Amritsar Rural SSP Deepak Hilori informed that police had arrested the youth on charges of theft and produced him in the court, and brought him on two days remand for further investigations. Deepak said police had booked him for theft and for now there was no visible sign of sacrilege. SYPP demanded a detailed inquiry to expose Ganna and the persons behind him who had offered Rs 1 lakh to Gursahib Singh. In the recent past on January 4, the local Sangat and the management of a gurdwara in village Bhagupur Havelian, near Ajnala, had held a person for sacrilege from the gurdwara. On December 18, a man had entered the sanctum sanctorum of Golden Temple and jumped atop the railing, and picked up the sword kept in front of SGGS. He was later beaten to death.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/amritsar/in-sacrilige-bid-man-breaks-open-gurdwara-donation-box/articleshow/89081172.cms||Yudhvir Rana
---||Business||Ready for settlement talks with govt but our fight in foreign courts to go on: Devas||Days after the Supreme Court ordered the winding up of Bengaluru-based startup Devas Multimedia, promoters of the company, which had been fighting a legal case against Isro’s commercial arm Antrix, are “ready for negotiations” with the Indian government but will continue their fight for the seizure of the Indian state assets abroad to seek compensation for the cancelled satellite deal, a Devas spokesperson said. Reacting to the January 17 Supreme Court ruling that upheld the NCLAT order to liquidate the company, Matthew D McGill, partner at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher and lead counsel for Devas shareholders, according to an agency report, said, “The decision by the Supreme Court does not change anything. The Modi government and the Indian courts cannot rewrite the facts. Their flimsy allegations of fraud will never stand up in courts outside of India.” However, he said, “A better approach for the Modi government would be to return to the negotiating table, and continue with settlement talks.” International arbitration tribunals had awarded the company a compensation of $1.2 billion for the cancelled satellite deal with Antrix and on the basis of those awards the company has been seeking seizure of Indian government assets abroad by pursuing legal cases in Canada, France and the US. Devas shareholders have been allowed by a Canada court in Quebec province to seize 50% of Air India funds, estimated to be around $23 million, lying with global airlines body IATA and have got a French court order for freezing an upscale apartment in Paris that houses India’s deputy chief of mission and is valued at €3.8 million. “We have already entered liens or obtained seizure and garnishment orders on tens of millions of dollars in Indian state assets. We will continue to identify and seize state assets wherever we find them until India returns in good faith to the negotiating table,” the Devas spokesperson said. Asked if Devas shareholders were following the path of UK’s Cairn Energy, which too identified Indian assets abroad to seize them in order to seek compensation from India, the company’s spokesperson said, “The Cairn case has nothing to do with Devas. Cairn dropped their challenges as part of their settlement with the government. Devas shareholders will continue to enforce the arbitration judgements until they are paid.” A day after the Supreme Court ruling, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said the government would use the Supreme Court order to fight against Devas investors’ attempt to seize Indian assets abroad so that the “fraud doesn’t get away” and would fight till the last to “save the taxpayers’ money”. While writing the judgment against Devas and its investors, Supreme Court judge Ramasubramanian, “We do not know if the action of Antrix in seeking the winding up of Devas may send a wrong message to the community of investors. But allowing Devas and its shareholders to reap the benefits of their fraudulent action, may nevertheless send another wrong message namely that by adopting fraudulent means and by bringing into India an investment in a sum of Rs 579 crore, the investors can hope to get tens of thousands of crores of rupees, even after siphoning off Rs 488 crore.” As per the January 2005 agreement, Antrix had agreed to build, launch and operate two satellites — Gsat-6 and Gsat-6A — and lease out 90% of the satellite transponder capacity to Devas, which had planned to use it to offer hybrid satellite and terrestrial communication services throughout India. However, the government had to cancel the deal in 2011 when it found allegations of manipulation in the deal.

Air India, the only Indian carrier that flies to the US, operates the route with Boeing wide-body aircraft. Other aircraft manufacturers too have issued similar documents, but the 5G effects vary. For instance: Airbus document states: “On A350 and A380 aircraft, 5G interference on radio altimeters are negligible, hence the absence of cockpit effects.” How do pilots read this?A senior B777 commander said: “Boeing has listed everything that could possibly go wrong in the cockpit if 5G interference ever happens...The message pilots get is, don’t attempt low-visibility landings, the radio altimeter isn’t reliable. Also, when landing in good weather, stay extra alert after descending 2,500ft and be ready for a manual landing.” Another senior Boeing 777 commander, who is from Indian Pilots’ Guild, the Air India union with B777 pilot-members, said: “Boeing has alerted pilots to the worst-case scenario. A Flight Crew Operations Manual is essentially a user-manual for an airplane. A bulletin is issued when a system might not function the way it is supposed to. When Boeing issues a bulletin, about 8 out of 10 pilots will never face any of the situations mentioned in it ever.” What pilots concur is, with 5G rollout in the US, the workload in the cockpit of US-bound aircraft has gone up. For instance: at height below 2,500ft, pilots will now need to be alert for possible 5G interference. Boeing instructs them to monitor and cross-check between two different altimeter readings. Above 2,500ft, a barometric servo altimeter gives altitude information by reading atmospheric pressure differences. It’s not affected by 5G waves. Below 2,500ft, aircraft systems and pilots rely on the more accurate radio altimeter readings. But if 5G wave interference happens, the radio altimeter could fail or give erroneous readings, says the bulletin. Capt Amit Singh, an air safety expert said: “At extremely low temperatures, barometric altimeter readings are not accurate. Now, the radio altimeter reading too is under suspicion because of possible 5G interference. So how can a cross-check happen between two sources that are not reliable?” Low temperatures also can present low-visibility conditions which is when approach and landings such as CAT-III—‘blind’ landings done by depending on aircraft instruments and ground navigation aids—are carried out. A 5G wave interference could lead to erroneous radio altimeter readi-ngs being fed into aircraft systems. So the ‘autopilot’ functions that help carry out low-visibility landings could fail, said the bulletin. Warning syste-ms that alert pilots to other aircraft on collision course could fail. Systems that give alerts on approaching terrain, obstacle might be rendered inoperative or function erroneously. Capt Singh said: “During training, pilots are drilled to trust the aircraft instruments to prevent spatial disorientation during low-visibility operations. With 5G, these instruments are under suspicion. Moreover, no specific set of instructions are given in the bulletin. From a human factor/performance perspective it’s a difficult task which will add to the workload and stress.” Capt. Sam Thomas, president, Air Line Pilots’ Association (ALPA), India said :“The current Boeing bulletin lists a host of issues that can occur with various systems…What the pilots require are unambiguous information and clear cut risk mitigating procedures,” said Capt Thomas. “We at ALPA India believe that a detailed evidence based study needs to be carried out before a comprehensive commentary can be made. Prima Facie it (the Boeing bulletin) almost prevents operations into the said airports,” he added. “The radio altimeter is a very key component of the aircraft and almost all automation have some amount of dependency on it. Autoland functions cannot be carried out unless dual channel radio altimeter is functional. The current bulletin lists a host of issues that can occur with various systems which leads one to believe that operational safety is in question. What the pilots require are unambiguous information and clear cut risk mitigating procedures,” Capt Thomas added. “We at ALPA India would like to request pilots to exercise abundant caution while operating to the airports in the United States mentioned in the NOTAMS which are likely to have Interference with 5G spectrum bands,” he added. The 5G-Radio Altimeter issueRadio altimeter is affixed to the base of the aircraft works by transmitting radio waves down to the Earth’s surface and receives a portion of the reflected wave. By computing the round-trip propagation time it measures the accurate height of the aircraft over ground/sea. The altimeter transmits in a radio frequency between 4.2 and 4.4GHz. In the US, the `5G C-band spectrum’ recently rolled out transmits fundamental emissions that lie between 3.7 and 3.98 GHz. But certain `spurious emissions’ could be found in the 4.2-4.4GHz frequency band, says an October 2020 paper on the subject published by Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics (RTCA), a US-based non-profit that develops technical guidance for use by government regulatory authorities. In a worst-case scenario, the fundamental emissions or spurious emissions from 5G tower could cause interference with radio waves affecting the performance of the radio altimeter, it adds. But resilient altimeters could withstand interference. The FAA SolutionIn the past three weeks, the US civil aviation regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA) has issued new approvals that allow an estimated 78 percent of the U.S. commercial fleet to perform low-visibility landings at airports where wireless companies deployed 5G C-band. This includes airplane models with one of the 13 cleared altimeters which include all Boeing and Airbus models; and some Embraer 170 and 190 regional jets.  “The FAA is working diligently to determine which altimeters are reliable and accurate where 5G is deployed in the United States. We anticipate some altimeters will be too susceptible to 5G interference. To preserve safety, aircraft with those altimeters will be prohibited from performing low-visibility landings where 5G is deployed because the altimeter could provide inaccurate information,” the FAA said in a statement. Capt Ranganathan said: “But it doesn’t mean every single Boeing and Airbus aircraft, from old generation to new, have these Currently, 5G is live in over 40 countries worldwide with no serious impact on aviation so far. But the 5G environment in US differs significantly from that of other countries. For instance: planned buffer zones for U.S. airports only protect the last 20 seconds of flight, compared to a greater range (96 seconds) in France. Also, 5G power levels are lower in France, 631 watts against the 1585 watts used in the US.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/boeing-warns-pilots-of-possible-worst-case-5g-interference-scenarios/articleshow/89081207.cms||Manju V

India reported 2,680 deaths from the virus during the week (January 17-23), a 92% rise from last week's toll of 1,396. The previous week had seen a similar rise in mortalities even as in absolute numbers deaths remain low in the third wave so far as compared with the previous two. Meanwhile, the near exponential increase in cases seen in the previous three weeks slowed considerably. The week-on-week growth in infections slowed to 30%, down from 112% last week and over 500% in the preceding week. This was the first week during the third wave when the growth percentage had dropped to two digits. However, with cases continuing to rise, India recorded close to 21.7 lakh fresh cases in the week, the fourth highest weekly tally since the pandemic began. The last time a higher number of cases was recorded was on May 10-16 last year, the week following the second wave's peak in the country. The slowing down of the Covid surge was partly on account of a drop in the cumulative cases from the eight largest cities — Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Pune and Ahmedabad. For the first time during the current wave, the cities together saw a drop in cases, from close to 5.5 lakh in the previous week to around 5 lakh.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/weekly-covid-toll-doubles-case-surge-starts-slowing/articleshow/89081288.cms||Amit Bhattacharya

The question assumed pertinence with BJP amplifying the Kairana exodus issue, stoking the narrative of another rift in the Yadav first family and cornering SP on criminalisation of politics. A senior BJP leader affirmed the ‘Kairana exodus’ issue continues to touch a raw nerve among people. “The exodus of Hindu families from Kairana has always been a cause of concern for BJP, before and after it came to power. Our priority was to help these people return home,” he said. In June, 2016, then BJP MP, Hukum Singh, released a list of 346 people who were forced to migrate from Kairana, a Muslim-majority town in western UP, because of “threats and extortion by criminal elements from a particular community”. Later, Singh retracted his statement, saying migration from the town was “essentially a law and order issue”, but the “exodus” narrative caught up with the communally sensitive region. UP BJP, with Amit Shah as in charge in 2013, sniffed an opportunity to corner the SP government then headed by Akhilesh Yadav, with assembly polls just a few months away. Cut to January, 2022. Shah, now a high-profile Union minister, was back in Kairana. He hit the alleyways of the town to carry out a door-to-door campaign, in a throwback to the 2017 BJP strategy to turn west UP into an epicentre of a saffron wave. In fact, immediately after SP-RLD released its first list of candidates on January 13, the BJP ranks pounced on Akhilesh for fielding Nahid Hasan from Kairana, while accusing him of masterminding the Hindu exodus. Even as Nahid got arrested on January 16 in a case lodged against him under the UP Gangsters and Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act in Kairana kotwali in February last year, his sister Ikra Hasan has filed the nomination as a backup. Samajwadi Party termed it as a BJP ploy to turn UP elections communal. “They have nothing to show. Which is why they are raking up Kairana again,” said SP spokesperson Abdul Hafiz. He insisted that BJP’s attempt to accentuate the “so-called rift” in Yadav family is also part of the same script. “The leaders who are deserting SP do not have any “janadhaar” (mass following) and their defection would in no way affect SP’s poll prospects,” he said in an apparent reference to defection of SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav’s younger daughter-in-law, Aparna, and his two relatives, Pramod Gupta and Hari Om Yadav, to the BJP camp. But BJP leaders insist the rift in the Yadav clan is a longstanding one and will tend to come out in the open in the event of a power struggle. “Earlier, it was between Akhilesh and his uncle Shivpal, now it is between Akhilesh and the family of his younger brother, Prateek,” said UP BJP spokesperson Hero Bajpai. In 2017, the stand-off between Akhilesh and his uncle Shivpal Yadav led to a rift in the SP’s first family just before the polls. BJP has also been sharpening its attack on SP brass by saying: “Ye nayi nahi...ye wahi Sapa hai”. CM Yogi Adityanath led the charge by flaying the SP leadership for fielding candidates with criminal antecedents in the first two phases of UP elections. Yogi, in fact, blasted SP for “not coming out of “tamancha” mentality and fielding candidates responsible for riots in Saharanpur and Muzaffarnagar. In 2017, too, the BJP raised the issue of poor law and order during the SP regime and accused it of sheltering criminals and mafia.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/assembly-elections-bjp-using-2017-script-to-pin-down-sp/articleshow/89081352.cms||Pankaj Shah

With each household having an average three members of voting age, the party hopes to wean away at least 12 crore voters to its camp. The BJP state leadership has in fact, chalked out a special strategy to reach out to every household, particularly those who have availed benefits of various Union and state government-run schemes in all 403 assembly segments across the state. In Prayagraj, BJP members have intensified their door-to-door campaign and are reaching out to all beneficiaries. Aiming for a clean sweep of 12 assembly seats in Prayagraj, party workers are pasting stickers of the party symbol ‘lotus’ at the entrance of homes of the beneficiaries. The campaign is being conducted in all 60 mandals of Prayagraj district. Apart from the campaign blitz on social media by taking the achievements of BJP-led Union and state governments to masses, a team of five party workers is also knocking at doors, particularly in slums, with the slogan ‘Poori Hui Har Aas, Ghar Ghar Hua Vikas’. Besides, the party is specially focusing on specific pockets where it had received less votes in 2017 elections. Party workers are hold camps at city’s prominent crossings to woo voters by interacting with them and sharing the list of state government’s achievements. Senior BJP member Ashish Gupta told TOI, “As the polling dates are inching closer, the party has intensified the ‘Har Ghar Bhajapa’ campaign in all the 12 assembly seats of the district.” All the panna pramukhs in the 60 mandals of the district have been assigned the task of conducting door-to-door campaigns and ensure that no house is left out. “Five-member teams of BJP workers are knocking the doors in the city, trans-Ganga and trans-Yamuna belts to garner support for the party,” said senior BJP member Shailesh Kumar Pandey.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/lotus-stickers-on-houses-of-govt-scheme-beneficiaries/articleshow/89081415.cms||Kapil Dixit

The police claimed that the accused offered loans at low interest rates, sought registration fees and cheated them.The fraud came to light after a resident of Faridabad’s Tigaon, Rishi, who was duped of Rs 1.93 lakh, filed a complaint at cyber police station in November last year. Following the complaint, police launched an investigation and found that a group is defrauding people in the name of cheap loans.“The accused used to make phone calls to people posing as employees of a financial and offered them loans at cheap rates. Once the victim was convinced to take a loan, the accused would ask for money in the name of registration charges, file expenses, processing fees and GST among others as a prerequisite to get the loan passed,” a police officer said.During the investigation, it was found that the gang was running their own call centre in Noida from where they would carry out the crime.The investigators have recovered Rs1.26 lakh, six mobile phones, one laptop, a cheque book and other important documents from their possession. The accused confessed that they have carried out 15 cyber frauds in five other states and UTs, including Delhi, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh. “The police departments in these states have been informed about this by us ,” said police spokesperson Sube Singh. The Faridabad police also claimed that one of the associates involved in this crime is still absconding and would be arrested soon.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/gang-offers-cheap-loans-cheats-many-8-arrested-in-fbd/articleshow/89081512.cms||Sagrika Kissu

These schools also should not admit new students for the next academic session as per the directions from the government. An official spokesperson with the education department said that the department had received several representations from the private school associations, requesting an extension of temporary affiliation. “The government, after due deliberation and consultation, decided to grant provisional affiliation for another academic session, 2021-22, to schools whose cases of permanent recognition had not been finalised by the department,” said the spokesperson said. The extension comes with a rider that the schools should produce the proof of the temporary recognition granted by the department in the last session, 2020-21. “Moreover, no further extension will be granted to such schools. They have to ensure that they do not admit students from the next academic session, 2022-2023, and any act contrary to the provisions of the rules will invite appropriate action,” the spokesperson added. The announcement comes after the department got flooded with several requests from the private schools and their associations. In December last year, the state education department had announced that the government was unwilling to give any further extension to unaffiliated schools. According to the education department, the schools concerned have failed to comply with its standards despite receiving multiple directions. It had plans to absorb the students of these schools in nearby state-run ones. After the latest announcement, schools called it meaningless, saying it’s a death knell for not just the schools but thousands of students enrolled there. They argued that they had been failing to comply with the space and land requirements of the education department. But when they requested the government to either shift them to other locations or grant permanent affiliation ignoring the limitations, the government failed to address their concerns. “Due to haphazard residential development around these schools, it has been impossible to expand their geographical area. The government should support us in meeting the norms, rather than just pulling us up for things beyond our control, “said Yashpal Yadav, state president, Haryana Sikshan Sansthan Sangathan. “We had told the education department that these schools should either be allowed to shift to new locations to meet its land requirement norms or be allowed to run in two shifts to comply with the safety standards. The government is for support and not just passing diktats, which will leave thousands of teachers, helpers and other staff unemployed,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/unaffiliated-schools-to-get-temporary-recognition-for-this-academic-session/articleshow/89081515.cms||Siddharth Tiwari
---||Gurgaon||Schools want change in fee hike exemption rule||Gurgaon: A section of the budget private schools in the state has demanded that the exemption category under the new fee rules be raised from Rs 15,000 to Rs 35,000.In October last year, the Haryana government had amended the education rules and linked the hike in private school fees with the national consumer price index (CPI). The move was intended at putting a cap on “arbitrary” fee hikes by some private schools, amid appeals from parents for an intervention.According to the amended Haryana Education Rules, 2003, the maximum hike a school can charge is 5% over the CPI. For instance, if the CPI for a period is 4%, the hike can’t exceed 9% of the previous year’s fee (4% +5%). The government, however, has made an exception for budget private schools. Those charging Rs 12,000 or less per annum for up to Class V and schools whose maximum fee for classes VI to XII is Rs 15,000 or less have been exempted from the cap.The schools demanding that the cap be raised to Rs 35,000 argued that the expenditure incurred by the institutions in urban centres like Gurgaon or Faridabad was not the same as those in some of the other districts.Protesting under the banner of the National Independent Schools Alliance (NISA), they pointed out that the Haryana government’s decision was based on a similar move in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh. “In UP, the per capita income is around Rs 45,000-Rs 50,000. There, the schools charging less than Rs 20,000 have been exempted from the new fee rules. In Haryana, the per capita is over Rs 2 lakh and yet the exemption is for schools charging less than Rs 15,000,” said Kulbhushan Sharma, the NISA president.The schools also pointed out that the fee rules in UP had been revised in 2018, but the inflation had surged since then. Yashpal Yadav, the president of the Haryana Siksha Sansthan Sangathan, said, “The new rules also don’t look into the fact that cities like Gurgaon and Faridabad have higher expenditure. For such cities, this exemption is meaningless and impractical. The government should ideally constitute a committee of stakeholders and deliberate on these issues before passing orders that lead to protests.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/schools-want-change-in-fee-hike-exemption-rule/articleshow/89081516.cms||---

The city also reported one more Covid death on Sunday. The positivity rate went down from 30.8% to 24.5%. As many as 3,079 Covid patients also recuperated on Sunday. The city now has 19,135 active cases, with only 180 patients in hospitals and 18,955 in home isolation. At 19,266, Gurugram had recorded less than 20,000 active cases on January 15 last. Currently, there is no active Omicron case. A 70-year-old woman admitted to hospital on January 21 due to shortness of breath, body ache and loss of appetite died on Sunday. The patient had a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic liver disease and had tested positive for Covid after hospital admission. Doctors said that the patient had been on IV fluids, antibiotics, Remdesevir, non-invasive ventilation and other supportive measures. The patient was later intubated and put on ventilator support but suffered a cardiac arrest on Sunday. In the past 14 days, the city has reported 18 deaths related to Covid — one on January 10, another on January 12, two on January 14, one each on January 15 and 16, and two each on January 17, 19, 20, three on January 21, two on January 22 and one on January 23. Gurugram has reported 945 Covid-linked deaths since the start of the pandemic. In these cases, 627 patients had comorbidities. With the number of new cases coming down, officials in the health department said this is the plateau phase, and soon, the district will witness a further decline in cases. “It seems like we have achieved the peak, and by next week, we will witness a decline,” said Virender Yadav, the chief medical officer. Till Sunday evening, 8,547 samples had been collected for testing. Doctors, however, said that more people, even children, may require hospitalisation in the coming days and requested people to be vigilant. “The number of children requiring hospitalisation this wave has been very less-only 1% of the patients in the OPD. Most admissions have been due to comorbidities. But we do expect some hospitalisation later over post-COVID multi-organ dysfunction and multi-inflammatory syndromes,” said Dr Ashutosh Sonia, consultant paediatrics, Manipal Hospital.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/city-sees-less-than-3000-cases-for-second-straight-day-1-more-death/articleshow/89081517.cms||Ipsita Pati

Four health workers in PPE kits wheeled him into the Covid wing, where they put him on oxygen support. The Haryana health department had directed all districts to conduct drills at government hospitals on Sunday to identify gaps in medical care for Covid patients. The drill at Civil Hospital continued for two hours, with Gurgaon chief medical officer Dr Virender Yadav attending the event. “We conducted the drill to check the ambulance management cell, oxygen supply and issues that can arise in case of an increase in Covid hospitalisations,” said Yadav. “The administration is well prepared to deal with any unpleasant scenarios. We also assessed medicine supplies at the central drug store and the warehouse drug quantity."Meanwhile, the doctors at the hospital responded to various scenarios involving mild, moderate and severe patients. They transferred a volunteer to another hospital in record time. They also carried out protocols for when oxygen supplying equipment is not working.“The drill ensured that hospital staff know their duty and can manage in case of an emergency,” said Dr Manish Rathi, deputy medical officer, Civil Hospital.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/civil-hosp-drill-checks-for-gaps-in-covid-care/articleshow/89081518.cms||Ipsita Pati
---||Gurgaon||Drive for Haryana's green cover? Experts demand protected status first||GURUGRAM: Eight south Haryana districts, including Gurugram and Faridabad, have been set a target of restoring a total of 11,272 hectares of the Aravali land over the next five years under the Centre’s Green Indian Mission (GIM). But experts have raised questions on the effectiveness of the project, pointing out that the state’s green cover would not increase until the areas where the saplings are being planted are given a “protected” status. Officials said this was the first time that restoration of the Aravalis had been included in the GIM. Launched in 2014, the mission undertakes all kinds of afforestation activities under the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC).  The primary aim is to protect, restore and enhance India’s diminishing forest cover. As of now, GIM is one of the eight missions identified under NAPCC across the country. Apart from Gurugram and Faridabad, the other districts that have been included in the project are Bhiwani, Nuh, Rewari, Palwal, Dadri and Mahendragarh. Of the 11,272 hectares that is supposed to be restored, Nuh has the highest area with 2,817 hectares, followed by Bhiwani (2,414 hectares), Rewari (1,602 hectares), Dadri (1,375 hectares), Faridabad (989 hectares), Palwal (699 hectares) and Gurugram (485 hectares). Over the next five years, the officials said, work would be carried out on several aspects, such as restoration of degraded open forests, grasslands and abandoned mining areas. “This is the first time that the Aravali landscape has been included under GIM. The Haryana government has submitted a proposal on this and it will be initiated over the next five years. We had never got GIM funds earlier. This is the first time that Haryana will get funds from the Centre for a green action plan,” said Suresh Dalal, additional principal chief conservator of forests. The Haryana government’s decision to send a proposal to the Centre to help in conserving the Aravalis comes months after it submitted an affidavit in the Supreme Court that all areas covered under the Punjab Land Preservation Act (PLPA) could not be considered as “forest land”. Environmentalists pointed this out, saying the initiative would hardly see success in the long run unless the areas covered by the GIM drive were accorded the status of “forests” and were protected from construction activities. “Creating a mission for the entire country is not an ideal way to increase the green cover in a state. Every state has its own land-use issues and should form its own methodology for enhancing green cover. Also, how can this project provide protection to an area after plantation of saplings? Most of the areas to be covered by the drive are either private or panchayat land,” said RP Balwan, a former forest conservator. “As of now, only some portion of the Aravalis is protected. So, where are they going to do the plantation? The forest department can plant saplings and enhance the green cover, but they have to develop some mechanism to ensure the saplings in private areas are protected. This gives a completely distorted picture of the status of forests,” he added. Another environmentalist, Vivek Kamboj, said, “What happens to the initiative if the private owner of a plot decides to remove the saplings? How can this improve the green cover? The state government does not have any machinery to check tree felling on their own land, let alone private areas.” According to forest department officials, any land, irrespective of its ownership, can be part of the GIM. For instance, the drive can be carried out in private properties such as schools, commercial establishments and on panchayat plots too. Told about the quest-ions raised by the acti-vists, chief conservator of forests Vasavi Tyagi said, “We are working on plans to increase green cover, not to give the area a ‘forest cover’ status. We will just carry out plantations, irrespective of the ownership of the land.” The entire project across the eight districts is estimated to cost Rs 989 crore. The Centre will disburse the money after going through the proposal sent by the Haryana government, officials said. According to the target set by the Haryana government, a total of 960 hectares of abandoned mining sites in Nuh and 42 hectares in Faridabad will be restored under GIM. Gurugram, which has the lowest target, aims at restoring open forests on 132 hectares and carry out agro-forestry across 353 hectares, according to the proposal sent by the forest department to the Centre.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/drive-for-green-cover-experts-demand-protected-status-first/articleshow/89081520.cms||Ipsita Pati
---||Gurgaon||Sustainable green plan for urban areas soon: GMDA||Gurgaon: The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) by the end of this year will put together a sustainablemanagement plan for the “urban environment” of its notified area. An official said the authority is currently working towards inviting an expression of interest for the same.According to officials, although the GMDA Act, 2017, mandated that such a plan should be prepared “from time to time”, the district environment management plan was prepared and released by the state government, creating uncertainty about whether a separate plan was required for the GMDA areas. “This sustainable environment management plan was supposed to be made as per the GMDA Act. We were carrying out the exercise but, in between, the district environment management plan was made. Hence, in the previous meeting of the GMDA’s Core Planning Cell, we brought up the matter to confirm whether we should adopt that plan or make our own,” said Subhash Chander Yadav, additional chief executive officer, Urban Environment Division.At the meeting, following the discussion, GMDA CEO Sudhir Rajpal directed officials to invite a separate expression of interest for preparation of the Sustainable Environment Management Plan. “The CEO said since the issues of the urban area tend to be a little different, we should make our own plan. A mobility management plan was prepared by the GMDA earlier, which had predictions for the city such as what the vehicle population and the human population would be, along with other parameters. We will take those as our basis and see what will be the environmental challenges in Gurgaon,” said the Additional CEO.“We will call an expression of interest for the project right now and give a period of six months for the completion of the work. This plan should be ready by the second half of the year,” he added.As per the GMDA Act 2017, the plan for the “sustainable management of the urban environment” will include “provision for urban forestry, tree plantation and horticulture” as well as “measures for solid waste management and water conservation”.The Act mandates that the plan be published on the GMDA website after it is prepared in order to invite objections or suggestions and, once these are incorporated and the final document approved, it should be uploaded once again on the website in its final form. The plan may however be modified from time to time as may be required.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/sustainable-green-plan-for-urban-areas-soon-gmda/articleshow/89081521.cms||Sakshi Dayal
---||Ghaziabad||Ghaziabad saw 17 cybercrime cases a day in 2021, mostly bank frauds||GHAZIABAD: The number of cybercrimes in Ghaziabad have increased by nearly 66% from 2020 to 2021, with nearly 17 cases reported daily last year. The district saw 6,157 cases registered across police stations under the IT Act from January 1 to December 31, 2021, but had seen only 3,717 in the same period in 2020, according to official data. The number of financial fraud cases increased from 2,864 in 2020 to 5,201 in 2021, a significant rise of nearly 82%. Meanwhile, the number of social media-related fraud cases increased from 853 in 2020 to 956 in 2021, a rise of 12% only. Among financial fraud cases in 2021, a maximum of 2,082 cases were related to bank or credit card. Back in 2020, just 921 people had been victims of such fraud. On the other hand, 1,413 cybercrimes in 2021 involved ATM withdrawals, OLX and job postings, lucky winner benefits, loan and other policy offers, Paytm accounts and SIMs. This number was only 831 in 2020. A senior police officer in the cyber cell said that in most of the financial cybercrimes this year, fraudsters called people on behalf of some bank. “When police trace such phone numbers, they are usually from Jharkhand, Nepal, Afghanistan and other places,” he added. Cops said that three gangs run by people from Nuh, Jamtara and Pratapgarh and the fourth operated by Nigerians are also involved in many of the financial cybercrimes, each working on a distinctive modus operandi. The cops, meanwhile, are working to catch the gang members. The gang from Nuh puts up ads to sell items on the online portal, OLX, adding a contact number. When unsuspecting victims call the number after seeing the advertisement, the gang members identify themselves as ex-Army people to gain their trust. The gang tricks people by promising to give them the item while also asking them to scan a QR code sent by it. When people do as directed, the fraudsters withdraw their money. Later, it switches off the number and removes the ads. The Jamtara gang, on the other hand, cheats people on the pretext of renewing their insurance policy. Gang members posing as insurance company representatives tell targets that their insurance policy will soon expire and offer renewal at a discount price, also promising lucrative returns for investments in other insurance policies. Upon reaching an agreement, the gang asks its targets to send their bank account passbook and Aadhaar card photos through WhatsApp or email. The targets also get tricked into sharing an OTP sent on their mobiles, which, in turn, is linked to their bank accounts. The fraudsters then can access their bank accounts and take the money. The Pratapgarh gang uses card cloning to cheat people. It fixes skimming devices at ATMs without a security guard to scan cards. When the victim uses a card at this ATM for withdrawing money, the fraudsters can take the details of that card without the victim even noticing anything odd. Later, the gang uses it to withdraw money. The Nigerian gang contacts its targets with emails of promising jobs in foreign countries and calls whoever replies and schedules an interview over the phone using an American or UK accent. Then, after passing the victim in the following job interview, the gang asks for processing fees and fees for visa work. But on receiving the money, the gang turns off its mobile phone.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ghaziabad/gzb-saw-17-cybercrime-cases-a-day-in-2021-mostly-bank-frauds/articleshow/89081523.cms||Avishek Kumar Dubey
---||Ghaziabad||More than 180 cheated in Ghaziabad in last 30 days by apps promising instant, paperless loan||GHAZIABAD: Over 180 complaints of loan frauds, including harassment and unjust recovery practices, by many mobile applications have been registered across the district since December 25 last year, police said. The apps lure gullible and needy people by promising quick loans without the hassles of paperwork or documentation, police added. Once installed, the apps gain access to all phone contacts, gallery and other sensitive information, which they later use to harass the victims. According to several complainants, despite repaying the loan, they were abused by recovery agents and also humiliated in front of friends and acquaintances with messages and photos going out that the victim had committed a “loan fraud” and should not be trusted. Some were allegedly also sent fake legal notices for “defaulting” on loans. A complainant, Sushma (name changed), claimed that she was harassed by recovery agents for over four weeks for a loan she took through an instant loan provider app with no paperwork. The Crossings Republik resident told that she was just keen about the process after spotting an advertisement on social media related to quick loans. Initially, the complainant claimed to have applied for a loan for a smaller amount on the app, Cash Fish. “I had applied for Rs 1,200 loan but after two days a person, who claimed to be an official from the app, asked to pay Rs 2,000 against the loan. I cleared the sum and decided to deactivate my account on the app and uninstall it. But the next day, I received a call that informed me that my loan was approved in another app. I also received a message with a link to the app. When I opened the link and downloaded the app, I was surprised to see that there was Rs 4,000 in the wallet of the account. Even the account was created in my name,” she said. According to the complainant when she tried to submit a complaint, an official from the company directed her to pay Rs 7,000 to settle the loan. “When I refused, the officials started misbehaving with me. They morphed my photo and wrote loan fraud on them. These pictures were sent to the friends and relatives on by phone’ contact list. I was compelled to pay Rs 7,000, but the harassment continued,” the woman said, adding she also received over 10 legal notices and finally submitted a complaint with the cyber cell. Son of a retired IPS officer, who had taken a small loan from a similar app and repaid it, was also targeted by the criminals recently, police said. The accused allegedly harassed the complainant by repeatedly calling and sending messages to him. The accused also accessed his mobile phone’s gallery, morphed his images and sent photos declaring him a loan fraudster to several of his relatives whose numbers were saved in the contact list. The victim finally changed his mobile number and submitted a complaint at Kavi Nagar police station about a week back. Inspector Sumit Kumar of Ghaziabad’s cyber cell told TOI that the first case came to the fore soon after December 25, 2021, and since then 15 complaints were being filed regularly. “We have identified some of these apps as Rich Cash, Kwik Cash, Super Wallet, Lucky Wallet, Speed Loan, Happy Wallet, Cash Fish, Rupiya Bus, Live Cash, Best Paisa, Rupaye Smart, Rupee Box, Loan Cube, Credit Box among many others,” Kumar said. “We have also formed a team to trace the source of these apps. Some of the complainants had provided some contact numbers from where they received calls,” he said. As per a recent estimate by the Reserve Bank of India, there are over 1,100 online loaning apps available in India across various internet platforms, of these over 600 apps for Android users were unlawful but distributed across over 80 app stores. A working group established by the central bank has recently proposed legislation that would subject these digital lending apps to verification in order to prevent scams.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ghaziabad/more-than-180-cheated-in-last-30-days-by-apps-promising-instant-paperless-loan/articleshow/89081525.cms||Avishek Kumar Dubey

The jingle, which exhorts all citizens to step forward to take up the cudgels for a cleaner and hygienic environment, was adjudged the best in the jingles category for the contest held on January 1 across five categories — jingles, short films, drawings, wall paintings and street plays — on the theme of ‘Swachh City’. Over 300 contestants took part in the contest, officials said. Of them a maximum of 220 entries were submitted for the drawing/painting category, followed by 32 short films, 25 jingles, 18 street plays and nine wall paintings. The first prize winners in each category, officials said, will be felicitated with Rs 21,000, while Rs 15,000 and Rs 11,000 will be given to the second and the third. Aartee Chhibba Antal, who tutored the Music Factory band, said the group has been composing music for NGOs. “They perform especially for underprivileged children to not only educate them but also to generate awareness among them on different social issues,” said Chhibba. The group also won the first prize for a street play based on the usage of dustbins. “We made it into a comedy with music from our band. Winning thse first prize in both categories has brought immense joy to the children,” Chhibba added. Fourteen-year-old Anhad Mishra, a Sector 27 resident and Somerville School student, bagged the first prize in the short film category with a 3.45-minute video on the beautification of Noida. A self-taught filmmaker, Mishra said he devoted hours to study the works undertaken by the Authority and translated them in the clip. Sarat Parida, a fine arts teacher at Mayoor School in Sector 126, won the first prize in the painting contest with art that fused Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Mahatma Gandhi’s vision on cleanliness. Meanwhile, Sector 51 RWA became the only residents’ body to win the first prize in the wall painting category. “Our aim was to beautify the wall and the area. This way, people will not smear the walls and will also be encouraged to keep the locality clean,” Anita Joshi, the RWA president of Blocks A and B of the sector, said. Noida Authority’s deputy general manager (public health) SC Mishra said the contest sought to involve people in the Swachh Mission. “We will be issuing certificates to all the participants while winners will be felicitated on January 31,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/jingles-play-or-film-theyll-tell-you-how-to-keep-the-city-clean/articleshow/89081526.cms||Anjali Singh

Of the total 532 liquor shops — English wine, beer, model and country-made shops — as many as 480 retailers have paid renewal fees, processing charges and an additional 7.5% licence fees to run their stores, officials said, adding that the remaining 52 shops will now be allocated through an online auction from the next month. Last year, the department had auctioned 54 shops online.While largely unchanged terms and conditions to run the shops for the next fiscal saw higher retention in most segments, the demand for renewing the licence for model shops remained muted for the second year in a row with vendors citing limited footfall owing to the pandemic and high licence fees — between Rs 54 lakh and Rs 1.57 crore — for their exit. The state government, while releasing the excise policy for the 2022–23 financial year, did not increase the licence fees or renewal charges. As per officials, while a beer shop has to pay Rs 70,000 for renewal, vends selling country-made liquor and English wine have to shell out Rs 95,000 each. Model shops, however, have to pay Rs 1 lakh as renewal fees. The department also charges model shop owners Rs 35,000 and retailers in other categories Rs 25,000 as processing charges. “Licence fees for model shops are extremely high. Additionally, due to the pandemic, not many people want to drink outdoors in confined spaces. Hence, more and more model shop owners are exiting from the business,” Devesh Jaiswal, a liquor businessman, said. Excise officer RB Singh said, “The licence fee is decided by the state government. As Noida is part of the NCR, it is on the higher side. We are going to look for people who are interested in opening model shops.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/90-liquor-vends-renew-licences-but-model-shop-biz-down-in-city/articleshow/89081528.cms||---

---||Ghaziabad||‘SP will throw Uttar Pradesh back to lawlessness’||GHAZIABAD: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday took a jibe at the Akhilesh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party (SP), saying it will throw Uttar Pradesh back into “lawlessness” and “riots” if it comes back to power. The CM, who held a series of public meetings in Sahibabad and Ghaziabad and conducted door-to-door campaigns at a few localities, referred to the Noida airport project in Jewar and said BJP was focused on development of the state. “In 2012, as soon as SP took over the reins (in UP), it decided to withdraw cases against the terrorists who attacked Shri Ram Janmabhoomi (in Ayodhya). Several riots took place in the state during the SP regime, while Kanwar Yatra was stopped, the celebration of Krishna Janmashtami was banned...,” the CM told the gathering in Ghaziabad. Targeting SP MP Shafiqur Rahman Barq, whose son Zia-ur-Rehman Barq has been named the party’s candidate from Moradabad, Aditynath said: “One glance at the list of (SP) candidates will expose their ideologies. SP has given a ticket to a candidate with ‘Talibani mindset’ in Moradabad.” Last year, Shafiqur was booked for sedition following his alleged remarks comparing the Taliban with Indian freedom fighters. The MP had later denied the allegations, saying his statement had been “misinterpreted”. Accusing SP of working only for the development of Saifai, the birthplace of Mulayam Singh Yadav, and “one family”, Adityanath said BJP followed the path of “Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas”.

---||---||‘SP will throw Uttar Pradesh back to lawlessness’||GHAZIABAD: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday took a jibe at the Akhilesh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party (SP), saying it will throw Uttar Pradesh back into “lawlessness” and “riots” if it comes back to power. The CM, who held a series of public meetings in Sahibabad and Ghaziabad and conducted door-to-door campaigns at a few localities, referred to the Noida airport project in Jewar and said BJP was focused on development of the state. “In 2012, as soon as SP took over the reins (in UP), it decided to withdraw cases against the terrorists who attacked Shri Ram Janmabhoomi (in Ayodhya). Several riots took place in the state during the SP regime, while Kanwar Yatra was stopped, the celebration of Krishna Janmashtami was banned...,” the CM told the gathering in Ghaziabad. Targeting SP MP Shafiqur Rahman Barq, whose son Zia-ur-Rehman Barq has been named the party’s candidate from Moradabad, Aditynath said: “One glance at the list of (SP) candidates will expose their ideologies. SP has given a ticket to a candidate with ‘Talibani mindset’ in Moradabad.” Last year, Shafiqur was booked for sedition following his alleged remarks comparing the Taliban with Indian freedom fighters. The MP had later denied the allegations, saying his statement had been “misinterpreted”. Accusing SP of working only for the development of Saifai, the birthplace of Mulayam Singh Yadav, and “one family”, Adityanath said BJP followed the path of “Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas”. The CM also took a jibe at Akhilesh’s free electricity promise. “Those who are saying today that 300 units will be given free, there was no electricity in their time,” he said.

Sharma said the party would make a historic comeback, and win by a bigger margin than that in the 2017 assembly elections. Lashing out at the opposition, he said Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party, Congress and all other smaller outfits together would not cross the three-digit figure.Taking a jibe at Congress, he referred to various opinion poll surveys and said the party would win just three to seven seats.He also attacked All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM), calling it the “B-team of the opposition parties”, which, he said, hoped to win the elections by polarising the voters. AIMIM has said it will contest from 100 assembly seats in UP.“Earlier, there have been many parties that have won through polarisation and by playing the caste card. But that was in the past. Now, the state has got the taste of development. People will not fall in the trap again,” he said.Sharma reached Greater Noida around 11am and went around various sectors like Alpha, Beta and the others. He claimed BJP had rid the state of riots. “Those who forced people to migrate have migrated themselves. All anti-social elements, history-sheeters and miscreants are either behind the bars or have left the state or have gone to a place from where they cannot come back,” he told reporters.“The opposition parties have given tickets to anti-social elements, but they have no place in the state,” he added. Gautam Budh Nagar and Ghaziabad will go to polls on February 10. Besides Nagar, who is the sitting MLA, there are 15 other candidates from Dadri.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ghaziabad/oppn-together-cant-cross-3-figure-mark-dy-cm/articleshow/89081535.cms||Aditya Dev
---||Noida||After poor response, Noida sets January 31 deadline for pet registry||NOIDA: Unhappy with the response to its mandatory pet registration drive, launched in September last year, the Noida Authority has now set a deadline of January 31 for all pet owners to complete the process. Failure to do so, officials said, would invite a fine of Rs 500. According to officials, only 200 pet owners, so far, have registered themselves on the Pet Registration App. The authority, meanwhile, has collated a list of around 5,000 house owners who have a pets. The survey, officials said, was conducted with the help of RWAs. The Pet Registration App was launched with the aim of promoting the welfare of pets as well as pet owners in the city, whereby apart from vaccination facilities, complaints related to pet litter in public locations or cause of disruptions can also be lodged on the app. “We have received a low response to the pet registration drive, where only 200 pet owners have registered their pets so far, whereas as per our survey there are 5,000 pets in Noida’s residential sectors and high-rises. The numbers may be more as we continue to collect data from the residents’ welfare associations,” said RK Sharma, senior manager of the public health department, Noida Authority. Sharma further stated that given the low response to the drive, despite it being launched over three months ago, CEO Noida Authority Ritu Maheshwari has directed that a deadline of January 31 be set for the pet owners to complete the registration process. “After that, we will be levying a fine of Rs 500 per pet that remains unregistered. It’s mandatory for a pet owner to have his pet registered and we urge all such residents to come forward and avail the benefits of this initiative,” said Sharma, who adds that all kinds of pets, including dogs, cats and other types of pets are required to be registered under the drive. While a registration fee of Rs 500 per pet owner will be charged, Sharma adds that in turn, the pet will be provided free vaccination and tracking for health issues. Following the directive on Sunday, Sector 11 RWA scheduled a pet registration camp for the residents of its sector today at their community centre from 12 noon to 3 pm. “All pet owners in the sector have been intimated to avail the benefit of the registration camp. For this, they are required to submit documents like a copy of their Aadhaar card, vaccination chart/book containing the date of vaccination with mention of the future date and a photo of their pet along with a picture of the owner with their pet,” said Anjana Bhagi, RWA general secretary Sector 11.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/after-poor-response-noida-sets-jan-31-deadline-for-pet-registry/articleshow/89081537.cms||Meenakshi Sinha

At this hour, where am I supposed to get these attested?” he asked, flashing out his marksheets.Some aspirants who had travelled from other districts claimed that the doors of the centre were closed at 9.30am. Denied entry, many of the candidates walked up to the elevated road nearby and blocked traffic. Police teams reached the spot and got them to vacate the road.At a centre in Sector 25, too, several candidates were denied entry over lack of attested mark sheets.Officials, however, said that the candidates had been given proper instructions to bring along copies of their attested mark sheets. The admit cards issued to the candidates also mentioned this, they said. “It was mandatory to bring along either the original mark sheet of BEd (Bachelor of Education) or BTC (Basic Training Course) or a copy certified by the college principal or any other competent authority,” said Dharamveer Singh, the district inspector of schools.Additional police teams had to be deployed at the exam centres to pacify the candidates denied entry. Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police, (ADCP), said around 30 candidates faced problems in the morning shift at four centres. “Those who did not have valid papers were sent back. There was no problem in the second shift,” he added.Across the city, over 17,000 candidates in 45 centres appeared for the UP-TET, which had to be cancelled last year over an alleged paper leak, in the morning shift. In the second shift, 13,882 candidates wrote the test at 35 exam centres. There were no reports of any protest in Ghaziabad.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/denied-entry-at-exam-halls-tet-candidates-block-road/articleshow/89081539.cms||Abhijeet Singh
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka milestone: 100% of target population get first dose; 85% both shots||BENGALURU: Late on Saturday, Karnataka achieved a vaccination milestone inoculating 100% of the eligible population with one dose against Covid-19. The state has given two doses to more than 85% and the drive to cover teenagers (15-18 years) and administering precautionary doses to seniors is also progressing at a good pace. Health minister K Sudhakar said: "We've achieved two milestones: First, we've done 6 crore tests, which is the third highest in the country. Right from the beginning, we've adhered to the 5-T strategy, which includes testing. This has allowed us to contain the pandemic. Second, we've covered 100% of the targeted adult population with the first dose. I congratulate all the healthcare and frontline workers, senior officials and district-level officers who have worked relentlessly in achieving this." Sudhakar said while data from some districts shows 97% or 98%, the overall coverage in the state has been 100%. Another official explained that there are also districts that have more than 100% coverage. As per the data made public by the government, the target adult population is pegged at more than 4.89 crore and the cumulative first dose coverage is more than the target. Twelve districts — Dharwad, Bidar, Davanagere, Belagavi, Bagalkot, Hassan, Kolar, Mysuru, Gadag, Chikkaballapura, Vijayapura and Kodagu — have reported more than 100% coverage with Gadag showing the highest at 105%.The districts that have more than 97% but under 100% coverage with the first dose are: Kalaburagi, Raichur, Yadgir, Dakshina Kannada, Bengaluru (BBMP and Bengaluru Urban district areas together), Shivamogga, Uttara Kannada, Chikkamagaluru, Udupi, Mandya and Bengaluru Rural. As of 9.30am on Sunday, Karnataka had administered both doses to 85% of the adult population with only three districts — Kalaburagi, Raichur and Yadgir — not having touched the 80% mark, while seven other districts have covered between 80% and 85%. Twenty districts have more than 85% and up to 96%. Separate data from the state health department shows vaccination coverage of teenagers (15-18 years) has gained pace with more than 67% of the targeted 31.7 lakh people having been given one dose already. By the end of January 22, nearly 21.4 lakh teenagers had been given the first dose, including more than 2.9 lakh in Bengaluru and more than 1.8 lakh in Belagavi. The government has given more than 4.6 lakh jabs of precautionary doses to healthcare workers (HCWs), frontline workers (FLWs) and seniors (more than 60 years old), which is nearly 84% more than the number of such doses administered as of a week ago. While more than 2.2 lakh HCWs had taken this shot, 78,340 FLWs and more than 1.6 lakh seniors have taken the precautionary jab. The highest jump is recorded among senior citizens.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/ktaka-milestone-100-of-target-popn-get-1st-dose-85-both-shots/articleshow/89081545.cms||---
---||India||Teens don’t need parents’ nod for jabs: Maharashtra official||PUNE: Consent from parents — written or oral — is not required for teenage Covid vaccination in the 15-17 age group, state immunization officer Dr Sachin Desai confirmed on Sunday. “There is a lot of confusion over seeking parents’ consent prior to vaccinating adolescents. But as per the Union government’s norms, parents’ consent is not required,” Dr Desai said. The issue of consent had cropped up soon after vaccination for teens was announced on school and college premises. “Schools are under the impression that they need parents’ written or oral consent before vaccinating their teenage students. But that's not the case,” Dr Desai said, adding that registration on the CoWIN portal before getting the shot is considered consent. “So schools should not compel students to bring consent letters from parents,” he said. The senior official also said the rule applies not only for vaccination at school or college premises, but at hospital-based vaccine centres too. Senior paediatrician Dr Pramod Jog, a member of the Covid task force, said, “Although parents’ written consent is not required, it is advisable that the parents accompany the child at the time of taking the Covid shot. This will bolster the confidence of the vaccinator at the vaccination centre. Besides, a parent’s physical presence is great mental support as well.” Bharat Biotech's Covaxin, which is currently being given to the country's adolescents (15-17 group) has the Union government's Emergency Use Approval for children (2-18 group). The vaccine has been found safe and effective in children's trials in the 2-18 bracket. Till January 18, officials said they have recorded only 125 cases of minor-side effects among 25 lakh teenagers who had received the Covid vaccine. Of them, 118 cases involved minor side-effects such as redness of the skin or pain at the injection site, minor fever and headache. The remaining two cases were not related to the Covid vaccine.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/teens-dont-need-parents-nod-for-jabs-maharashtra-official/articleshow/89081549.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Mumbai||Boeing warns pilots of possible worst-case 5G interference scenarios||Mumbai: Aircraft manufacturer Boeing recently issued airline-specific bulletins alerting pilots to a long list of possible problems the cockpit could be besieged with at lower altitudes if 5G signals from a transmission station near a US airport ever happen to hazardously interfere with those of an aircraft instrument that measures accurately the plane’s height over ground. Air India, the only Indian carrier that flies to the US, operates the route with Boeing wide-body aircraft. Other aircraft manufacturers too have issued similar documents, but the 5G effects vary. For instance: Airbus document states: “On A350 and A380 aircraft, 5G interference on radio altimeters are negligible, hence the absence of cockpit effects.”A senior B777 commander said: “Boeing has listed everything that could possibly go wrong in the cockpit if 5G interference ever happens...The message pilots get is, don’t attempt low-visibility landings, the radio altimeter isn’t reliable. Also, when landing in good weather, stay extra alert after descending 2,500ft and be ready for a manual landing.”Another senior Boeing 777 commander, who is from Indian Pilots’ Guild, the Air India union with B777 pilot-members, said: “About eight out of 10 pilots will never face any of the situations listed in a bulletin. So long as the engines are working and the runway is in sight, there should be no problem.”What all pilots concur is, with 5G rollout in the US, the workload in the cockpit of US-bound aircraft has gone up. For instance: at height below 2,500ft, pilots will now need to be alert for possible 5G interference. Boeing instructs them to monitor and cross-check between two different altimeter readings. Above 2,500ft, a barometric servo altimeter gives altitude information by reading atmospheric pressure differences. It’s not affected by 5G waves. Below 2,500ft, aircraft systems and pilots rely on the more accurate radio altimeter readings. But if 5G wave interference happens, the altimeter could fail or give erroneous readings, says the bulletin.Capt Amit Singh, an air safety expert said: “At extremely low temperatures, barometric altimeter readings are not accurate. Now, the radio altimeter reading too is under suspicion because of possible 5G interference. So how can a cross-check happen between two sources that are not reliable?” Low temperatures also can present low-visibility conditions which is when approach and landings such as CAT-III—‘blind’ landings done by depending on aircraft instruments and ground navigation aids—are carried out. A 5G wave interference could lead to erroneous radio altimeter readings being fed into aircraft systems. So the ‘autopilot’ functions that help carry out low-visibility landings could fail, said the bulletin. Warning systems that alert pilots to other aircraft on collision course could fail. Systems that give alerts on approaching terrain, obstacle might be rendered inoperative or function erroneously.Capt Singh said: “During training, pilots are drilled to trust the aircraft instruments to prevent spatial disorientation during low-visibility operations. With 5G, these instruments are under suspicion. Moreover, no specific set of instructions are given in the bulletin. From a human factor/performance perspective it’s a difficult task which will add to the workload and stress.” Capt Sam Thomas, director (India) of International Federation of Air Line Pilots Association, said: “What pilots require are un-ambiguous information and clear-cut risk mitigating procedures.” He added that evide-nce-based study needs to be ca-rried out before a comprehensive commentary can be made. Capt Mohan Ranganathan, an air safety expert, said: “One more reason now for pilots not to be complacent with automation. They will need to have good manual flying skills.”In the last three weeks, the US aviation regulator has found 13 radio altimeter models to be robust enough to withstand interference. “Aircraft models with one of the cleared 13 altimeters include all Boeing and Airbus models,” it said. Capt Ranganathan said: “But it doesn’t mean every single Boeing and Airbus aircraft..have the robust altimeters.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/boeing-warns-pilots-of-possible-worst-case-5g-interference-scenarios/articleshow/89081552.cms||---

A day after the fire killed six people, authorities identified the body of Meena Mistry (68), one of the two deceased they had been unable to recognise earlier. Eight people continued to be in a critical condition in hospital. As a suspected short circuit in the electrical duct area of the 19th floor burnt the entire wiring, it also generated smoke on almost all floors. In a mere two months, 223 high-rises get fire brigade notices for safety violationsThe fire-fighting system at the 20-storey Sachinam Heights, a chawl redevelopment project, was not in working order when the blaze occurred early on Saturday. Such fatal mistakes abound in the city: in the past two months, the fire brigade issued notices to no less than 223 high-rises for flouting fire safety norms. The notices were issued to these structures under the Maharashtra Fire Prevention and Life Safety Measures Act, 2006, for various deficiencies found in their fire-fighting systems, shows municipal data. These deficiencies were discovered during inspections carried out between November 18 and January 8 several tall buildings. A fire brigade official said that every ward is directed to inspect a certain number of buildings on a weekly basis. “As per Section 3 (3), it is mandatory for the owner or occupier, as the case may be, to furnish a certificate, called Form B and issued by a licensed agency, twice a year—in January and July regarding the maintenance of existing fire prevention and life safety measures in good repair and efficient condition. However, we found that in many cases this was not being done. Therefore, notices to such societies were issued,” said the official. Other deficiencies for which notice was issued by the fire brigade included encroachments in the common passage area, keeping terrace door locked, encroached or occupied refuge area and non-working fire-fighting systems in the high-rises. Fire brigade officials said that they had repeatedly appealed to residents living in high-rise buildings to ensure that all fire detection and fire-fighting equipment installed in the building were in good working condition and there was trained manpower available to operate these. It is also important that regular fire safety drills—mock drills—should be carried out to ensure the proper working of the riser and sprinkler system installed in the building. At Sachinam Heights, the 19th-floor fire gutted flat number 1904. Three people from the building died of burn injuries and three of suffocation. On Sunday, authorities identified the body of Meena Mistry (68), one of the two deceased they had been unable to recognise earlier. Now, one body remains unidentified at the BMC-run Nair hospital. Eight patients continue to be critical, with one having suffered over 50% burn injuries. As a suspected short circuit in the electrical duct area of 19th floor burnt the wiring of the entire building early on Saturday, it also generated thick smoke on almost all floors of the building. The fire brigade said the blaze was now doused but thick dust and smoke still lingered in several parts of the building, especially from the 11th floor up. As a result, residents of flats till only the 10th floor were allowed to salvage their belongings.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/in-a-mere-two-months-223-high-rises-get-fire-brigade-notices-for-safety-violations/articleshow/89081553.cms||Richa Pinto

A single-judge bench of Justice V G Bisht, on January 20, said Section 50 of the NDPS Act requires a suspect to be told of his or her right to be searched “only” before a gazetted officer or a magistrate, which was not done in this case. The bench further said that the police produced no proof that the officer had informed his superiors about the seizure within reasonable time under Section 42 of the Act which governs power of entry, search, seizure and arrest without warrant or authorization.Joy’s lawyer Mithilesh Mishra sought bail arguing total non-compliance of the mandatory search-and-seizure provision under the NDPS Act. Opposing the plea, additional public prosecutor H J Dedhia said police had complied with the procedure and the suspect had declined being searched before a gazetted officer or a magistrate. He added that another 534gm of cocaine was found at his residence.The HC, however, noted that the police intimation given to the suspect said: “You have a right to give your personal search in presence of a gazetted officer or a magistrate. If you so require, we may take you to the nearest gazetted officer or a magistrate”. Justice Bisht said: “A simple reading would show he was not apprised of his right under Section 50 to be searched ‘only’ before a gazetted officer or a magistrate as mandated by the Supreme Court in Vijaysinh Jadeja’s case.” The HC granted Joy bail on a PR bond of Rs 50,000 with one or two sureties and imposed several conditions, including non-tampering with witness or probe, not to commit similar crime in future, and not leave India without court nod.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/search-seizure-process-not-followed-hc-gives-man-bail-in-drugs-case/articleshow/89081554.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Mumbai||Cops register six accidental death reports in Tardeo fire||Mumbai: The Gamdevi police have registered six separate accidental death report (ADR) cases in connection with the fire at the 20-storey Sachinam Heights in Tardeo. No first information report (FIR) has been registered yet.Besides causing the death of six people, the blaze left 24 people with injuries.The police said they were waiting for the report from the fire brigade and the BMC, and based on their report they would decide on their course of action.The fire brigade report may give the exact cause of fire and the police will take action accordingly. An ADR is registered under Section 174 in the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973. In cases like someone falling to death or suicide, the police first register an ADR and during the investigation they establish the reason behind the pasing away of the person. If any criminality is found, an FIR is registered and if nothing suspicious is found, the final report is filed. A police officer is empowered to probe such cases and find out the exact reason behind a death. In case of the building fire, the police are in the process of recording statements of witnesses, including building residents. The police will also attach the autopsy report in their final report when it is submitted to the ACP or officer above that rank.The fire started around 6.45am at the 20-storey Sachinam Heights, said fire brigade officials. Many of the building residents were still asleep when the blaze began. A short circuit was the likely cause of the fire. Three of the deceased succumbed to burns and three died of suffocation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/cops-register-six-accidental-death-reports-in-tardeo-fire/articleshow/89081555.cms||Mateen Hafeez
---||Mumbai||Now, BMC wants buildings to make electrical audits a habit||Mumbai: With 70% of fires in buildings in Mumbai happening due to short circuits, senior civic officials along with the chief fire officer recently conducted a joint meeting with a representative of the chief electrical inspector to conduct periodic electrical audits of buildings so as to reduce incidents of fire caused by defective electric circuits.The blaze at Sachinam Heights in Tardeo on Saturday morning was also likely to have been caused by a short circuit in the electrical duct on the 19th floor, said fire officials. The investigation report will establish the exact cause of the blaze that killed six people. In October last year, a blaze at the 60-storey One Avighna Park killed one person. That fire was also attributed to a short circuit.Civic officials said that the office of the chief electrical inspector was informed to carry out an electrical audit of all the high-rise buildings having a height of 15 metres (five floors) and above as per the provisions of Section 36 of Central Electrical Regulations 2010 and a representative present on behalf of the chief electrical inspector consented to it. A BMC official said that the joint meeting was held three weeks ago in the BMC headquarters.“Currently under the Maharashtra Fire Prevention and Life Safety Measures Act 2006 there is no provision for making electrical audit mandatory in fully occupied buildings of Mumbai. However we have found that there is a provision under the Central Electrical Regulations 2010, where the same can be mandated and hence we are trying to invoke it,” said the official. As per the Fire Prevention Act, currently a bi-yearly fire audit is mandated in all high-rise buildings.The fire brigade has also held talks with experts to see how such electrical defects can be identified. “We have found that there are devices available which 24 X7 monitor the electrical circuit of a structure and send out indicators in case of them having defects. We are trying to see if the same on a trial basis can be installed in civic buildings with high footfall,” said the official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/now-bmc-wants-buildings-to-make-electrical-audits-a-habit/articleshow/89081556.cms||Richa Pinto

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra issues maximum BH-series number plates||MUMBAI: Maharashtra has recorded maximum registrations -- around 34% -- of the total BH (Bharat)-series number plates registered around the country, latest statistics showed. Said state transport commissioner Avinash Dhakne, “This special number plate is beneficial for vehicle owners who have to move from one state to another which includes government as well as private jobs. It enables vehicle owners to avoid various registration issues faced earlier due to the inter-state shifting.” In fact, the BH-series number plate registrations crossed the 1,000 mark in the state this week. While Maharashtra issued 1,017 BH-number plates since it launched in October end last year, Odisha issued 444, Delhi 382, Rajasthan 326 and Uttar Pradesh 229. The total number of number plates issued in the country were 2,960, the statistics showed. A senior RTO official said, “In the private sector, an employee of a company which has offices in at least four states/Union Territories is eligible to get the BH number on a voluntary basis.” Said Dhakne, “It is a good system as there will be no more hassles of getting a car registered in a new state everytime you are transferred. I have witnessed people struggling earlier to get vehicles transferred to another state, fill up a number of RTO forms, get NOCs and tax refunds etc.” He added that there were many applicants from public sector undertakings who have now got the BH-series number plates. Until now, according to the Motor Vehicle Act 1988, a vehicle registered in a state when kept in another state for a period of more than 12 months is subject to the assignment of new registration. The registration process which was tedious in nature, has now been done away with after the launch of BH-series. How does one apply? The vehicle owner has to apply by filling up Form 60 and furnishing valid employment ID/proof online. The state authorities will verify the proof and then assign the BH registration. The registration number will be randomly generated by a computer, officials said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/state-issues-maximum-bh-series-number-plates/articleshow/89081558.cms||Somit Sen
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Energy minister Nitin Raut threatens to cut power supply to govt departments||MUMBAI: State energy minister Nitin Raut has informed chief minister Uddhav Thackeray that he has no option but to discontinue electricity supply to various government departments over non-payment of crores to the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd (MSEDCL). Street lights in urban and rural areas are likely to be shut off if the energy department goes ahead with its decision to discontinue supply as a move to pressure the urban and rural development departments to clear past dues. In a letter to to the CM last week, Raut has said that the MSEDCL has already taken loans worth approximately Rs 45,000 crore. “There is coal shortage across the country. The Centre has already informed the Reserve Bank of India not to extend loans to MSEDCL. Grants have not been released. If we can disconnect the electricity supply of other consumers who have not paid their bills then why not of government departments who owe MSEDCL around Rs 16,000 crore?” he told TOI. The letter points out that the limit for loans has been reduced from Rs 25,000 crore to Rs 10,000 crore. Besides, the state government is yet to release Rs 7,978 crore in grants. MSEDCL provides electricity to approximately 2.8 crore consumers across the state. Agricultural pump users owe the company approximately Rs 41,000 crore, and while the new agricultural pump policy has helped recover some dues, it is not enough, Raut informed Thackeray in the letter. Raut said he has asked for an urgent meeting with the chief minister to discuss the issue. “It is my duty to appraise the chief minister of the dire situation before we go ahead with the decision to disconnect supply,” he said. The letter points out that the rural development, water supply, and urban development department owe a substantial amount to the company as does the industry department.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/energy-min-threatens-to-cut-power-supply-to-govt-depts/articleshow/89081559.cms||Clara Lewis
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra man falls for ‘3 thalis for Rs 100’ offer, loses Rs 1 lakh in card fraud||MUMBAI: An elderly man from Khar lost Rs 99,520 on his credit card after he fell prey to a hoax ad promising delivery of a thali for Rs 100, along with two thalis free. The 74-year-old victim, ND Nand, thought it was a safe bet as the ad stated that he would only have to pay an advance of Rs 10 by credit card, and then pay the remaining Rs 90 in cash upon delivery. Instead, his card was charged twice for Rs 49,760. The fraud took place on January 19, when Nand was browsing on Facebook and came across an ad offering a thali at an inaugural price of Rs 100. Tempted by the deal, Nand called the number listed on the ad. In the complaint, Nand said, “A person identifying himself as Deepak attended the call and asked me to provide him with my credit card details to place the order. He told me that initially Rs 10 would be deducted and I have to pay Rs 90 in cash once the order was delivered. The person then asked me to share the one-time password that I received to complete the order.” A police officer said Nand realised that he had been duped immediately after he received two SMS alerts related to the fraudulent transactions that were carried out from his credit card. “We have sought details from the bank to collect information of the account to which the money got credited,” said an officer from the Khar police station. The Khar cops are also collecting call data information to track the fraudster. A case was filed under the IPC and IT Act.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/tempted-by-free-thalis-man-loses-1l-in-credit-card-fraud/articleshow/89081560.cms||V Narayan

The fraud occured four days after TA Choudhary (21) made a payment of Rs 528 towards the online order, for which he received a mail confirmation from kitchencup@gmail.com. His complaint stated: “On January 17, I received a call from a person claiming to be from Kitchencup, asking for the order number and my mobile number. The person claimed my order was cancelled and disconnected the call. Then I realised that my mobile network had been hacked and all the calls were barred.”“The fraudster called Choudhary to confirm his mobile number and the booking ID number, which may have been the OTP to hack his mobile,” said an officer from BKC police. —V Narayan||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/man-tries-to-buy-pressure-cooker-online-gets-hacked-and-loses-85k/articleshow/89081561.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Preschools reopen after 22 months but parents to wait and watch||MUMBAI: Preschools across the city are geared up to welcome their students to in-person learning on Monday, 22 months since the pandemic moved classes online. Orientation sessions and virtual tours for parents have been conducted by preschools that expect students’ physical attendance to rise in the coming weeks. Dr Swati Vats, president, Early Childhood Association and Association for Primary Education and Research, said they are expecting 30-40% attendance in the first week. “Preschools have been waiting to reopen and have put all Covid protocols in place. Parents are adopting the wait-and-watch policy,” she said. Dr Vats pointed out that preschoolers have suffered the maximum social and emotional loss and need to return to school. A survey on the status of early childhood education during last year’s pandemic had shown a 30-40% drop in virtual enrolment in preschools. The survey by independent think tank Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy had found that around 60% of those who attended physical classes during pre-pandemic times had dropped out of online preschooling. While preschools will continue to work in the hybrid mode, they are encouraging parents to send children to classrooms. Supriya Limaye, who in December was all for sending her daughter Aria (4) to her preschool, now has second thoughts. “Aria is excited about going to school but we will wait for a few weeks,” she said. Happy Minds International, which has branches across the city, has conducted physical and virtual tours for parents. “While parents will take a while to send children to preschools, our daycare centres are getting good response as most parents have started work,” said director Sonia Chugh. Divya Somani said that her daughter Ahana (5) will be attending the Happy Minds International preschool in Powai as she is satisfied with the arrangements. “Ahana is excited to wear the uniform and get to school,” she added. Girija Malik, centre head of Kangaroo Kids in Andheri, said their focus is on bringing children back to routine gradually, which might take one to 15 days. Across the state all schools can resume offline from Monday, after they had to shut down early January due to rising Omicron cases.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/preschools-reopen-after-22-mths-but-parents-to-wait-and-watch/articleshow/89081564.cms||Sandhya Nair
---||Mumbai||Omicron found in 88% of Covid positive samples in Mumbai||MUMBAI: Omicron has been found in 88% of the Covid-19 positive samples in the city, making it the dominant strain in circulation, BMC officials confirmed on Sunday. The new variant that emerged in December has elbowed out the more virulent Delta variant and its derivatives, although experts cautioned that the shift shouldn’t lead to lowering of guards yet. The findings were confirmed by the BMC’s eighth round of genome sequencing, the results for which were finalised over the weekend. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, said out of 363 samples sequenced, 320 (88%) were found to be Omicron. Of the rest, 30 (8%) were of Delta derivatives, three (0.8%) were of Delta and 10 (2.7%) were others. The previous genome sequencing carried out in December-end had found Omicron in 55% of the positive samples. BMC’s sequencing report reiterates the recent findings of the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) that Omicron is now in community transmission in India and has become dominant in many metros. The INSACOG is a consortium of 38 labs that report genomic surveillance of SARS CoV-2 strains across the country. Dr Shashank Joshi, a me-mber of state Covid taskforce, said the lower rate of hospitalizations and severity were indicative that Omicron had taken over Delta in Mumbai. “Much like South Africa, the extremely fast-paced peak came and receded like a tsunami,” he said. But, Omicron has three lineages, BA.1, BA.2 and BA.3. “Globally, BA.2 has been spreading in countries like the Netherlands and Norway,” he said. The World Health Organisation has not yet distinguished between Omic-ron and its BA.2 sub-lineage. The INSACOG bulletin said BA.2 lineage is a substantial fraction in India. Also, the S gene deletion that was there in Omicron is absent from BA.2. “S-gene dropout-based screening is thus likely to give high false negatives,” it said. In Mumbai, more details of Omicron’s sub-lineages are awaited. Doctors said elderly patients continue to come with lung involvement, but the majority are unvaccinated, partially vaccinated or severely immunocompromised. “While most Omicron cases so far have been asymptomatic or mild, hospitalizations and ICU cases have been increasing...The threat level remains unchanged,” the INSACOG said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/omicron-found-in-88-of-covid-ve-samples-in-mum/articleshow/89081565.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The two cops, woman constable Nirmala Lohare and Bharat Suryavanshi, were booked under IPC sections 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant, or by banker, merchant or agent) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention). Police sources said Lohare was responsible for the safety of the valuables in 2012, but was transferred to another department. Later, Suryavanshi took charge but he, too, was transferred and another constable Sangeeta Wagh was posted for this job. While verifying seized items’ list, Wagh found Rs 3.21 lakh in cash and gold worth Rs 2.1 lakh were missing.

---||Mumbai||Covid-19: 100% first dose vaccination a distant dream in Maharashtra||MUMBAI: The possibility of covering the state's 100% adult population with a single shot of Covid-19 vaccine is increasingly seeming distant. Maharashtra has covered 90.4% of its people above 18 years with the first shot, a tad below the national average of 94%.  However, the growth of first dose coverage has slowed to a snail’s pace of 4% between December 20 and January 20. Whereas, second dose coverage increased by 10% in the same period. State data shows that barely 3% of daily vaccinations are first doses for adults. In between, the drive has also added new arms -- immunisation for 15-17 years and booster shots for essential workers and senior citizens. All combined, district officials admit they are no longer fixated on reaching the 100% goal.  The state has an estimated adult population of 9.14 crore, of which 8.27 crore have taken at least the first shot. It leaves nearly 90 lakh people who haven't taken any vaccine dose yet. “Those who haven't taken the first shot till now are unlikely to take it at all,” according to Rajesh Narvekar, collector of Thane. More than 10 lakh people from Thane have not taken the first shot, the highest among districts. “The footfall of people coming for first shots is negligible now,” he added. The Covid vaccination campaign completed a year on January 16. While several state officials said that even 90% coverage for a big state like Maharashtra was no mean feat, the fact remains that UP, the country's most populous state, has delivered the first dose to 96% of its population as of January 20. States like Kerala, Karnataka and Gujarat too have managed to cover more than 99% with the first shot.  Dr Sachin Desai, the state’s immunisation officer, agreed that there was a saturation in first dose coverage. “The reasons vary for districts, but a small percentage may be hesitant everywhere,” he said, adding that districts are regularly nudged to cover as much of the adult population as possible. He said second dose vaccination continues to perform. The state has covered 65% with both shots, although it is below the national average (71%).  Within Maharashtra, the variation between districts in terms of first and second dose coverage remains gaping. Only three districts, including Mumbai, Pune and Bhandara, have achieved 100% vaccination with the first dose. Incidentally, none of the districts has managed to achieve 100% for both shots yet. Districts like Nandurbar are still languishing at 44% double shot coverage. In Mumbai, despite repeated claims by civic authorities, achieving 100% full vaccination by the end of January looks unrealisable. The city has given both shots to 93% of its population and remains the best performer among districts.  Worryingly, in at least a dozen districts, the coverage of population above 45 years with both doses is only 50-60%. Dr Desai said people aged above 45 years remain highly vulnerable and they must complete their full schedule of vaccination.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/100-first-dose-vaccination-a-distant-dream-in-the-state/articleshow/89081567.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Sanjay Sisodiya was declared brain dead after he was shifted to H N Reliance Foundation Hospital from another facility. Dr Arun Shah, director of neuro sciences at the hospital, said that Sisodiya had suffered a stroke. The family agreed to the donation when approached by the hospital.  One of the donor’s kidneys was transplanted into a patient at Reliance, while another kidney and liver were shared with two centres in the western suburbs. The donor’s son Harsh said, “We are unfortunate to lose our father at such a young age.

---||Mumbai||PSU bad bank, reforms for asset rejig cos hang fire||Mumbai: Banks have come out of the bad loan mess through provisions made from profits and new capital. However, the deadweight of these old accounts continues to be on their books as the National Asset Reconstruction Company (NARC) or ‘bad bank’ announced in last year’s Budget is yet to take off and some proposed reforms for private asset reconstruction companies (ARCs) are still pending.New buyers for bad loans are also needed as the recovery rate is slipping and more bad loans may turn up in future. The recovery rate from bad loans, which jumped from 26% pre-bankruptcy code to around 39% as of FY21, is again slipping thanks to delays in bad loan resolution. Besides, reducing the upfront cash requirement from 15% to 2.5%, an RBI panel had proposed major reforms for ARCs. They include allowing ARCs to submit resolution plans for bankrupt companies.“The next wave of NPAs will emanate from stressed MSME and retail sectors after the available restructuring windows close. For transfer of these small-ticket loans to ARCs, there is an urgent need to broad base investor base with inclusion of high net-worth individuals, corporates, family offices, trusts to subscribe to ARC security receipts, as recommended by the RBI appointed committee recently,” said Hari Hara Mishra, director, UV ARC.According to Edelweiss ARC MD R K Bansal, there is a need to discontinue the minimum alternate tax (section 115JB) that is currently levied on a company whose application under the provisions of IBC has been admitted by NCLT, till the time that the company’s prospects turnaround considering the resolution plan submitted to the NCLT. “This would benefit in carrying forward the entire brought forward book losses and unabsorbed depreciation for set off in future years, thereby making the acquisition of distressed companies more lucrative,” said Bansal. Buyers of insolvent companies face tax demands if the price they pay is less than the fair market value or the listed price.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/psu-bad-bank-reforms-for-asset-rejig-cos-hang-fire/articleshow/89081569.cms||Mayur Shetty

Will there be an encore given that rural markets have slowed down and high inflation continues to bite? In an exclusive interview with TOI, Mehta speaks about how HUL is navigating the choppy external environment, while also developing in-house new age business endeavours. His Budget wish: An MGNREGA equivalent for the urban poor. Excerpts:Unilever is planning to recast its structure. What does this mean for HUL?Organisations keep evolving with the changing times. The consumer trends are changing, the channels are reshaping and the competitive context is changing. In this respect, the premise around which Unilever is working on the new structures is — how do you make the company much more agile than what it is today, enhance category focus, and strengthen accountability.Last year, you had said that you want volume-led growth with healthy margins. Should HUL be more discreet in taking grammage reductions?When things are normal, you look at volume growth very closely. Around 65-70% of our topline growth consists of volume growth. That’s the reason we have talked about volume-led profitable growth. But when there is hyperinflation, you can’t stick to the same metric. There are two important imperatives — to ensure consumers remain with you and to protect your business model. We play the portfolio as we have brands and pack sizes at different price points, offering varied benefits. Our intent is that even if a consumer chooses to change a brand it should remain within Unilever’s portfolio of brands. When it comes to price increases the first port of call is looking at all lines of P&L (profit & loss), optimise the costs and only then in a calibrated manner we look at price increases. We also look at the strength of our brands to carry price increase and also endeavour to protect the packs with low price points. It’s not an easy game but at HUL, we always play the game for the long term. We would never do things at the cost of the long-term health of our business.Inflation and Covid would have been especially harsh on smaller players in FMCG. Has that share of the market shifted to HUL?There has been more formalisation of the economy. It’s not come to our attention that some players who were big in certain pockets, have closed shop. But our performance is not just good compared to the average of the market. Our share gains have been extremely good and in most categories they are top of the league and even when compared to our big competitors.How are you competing with the D2C startups?The headroom to grow in India is massive. It is not a zero-sum game. We see these as opportunities and that’s the reason we set up our own premium business unit whose whole mandate is digital-first brands. We have put our best entrepreneurial people to focus on it and start growing. For us, digital is something that is going to impact the whole value chain. Over 15% of our demand is now captured digitally. We have seen great success and 15% of our Rs 50,000-crore business is a substantive business compared to any other digital-first brand.What are your Budget expectations?The government could look at extending the outlay on MGNREGA till the economy fully recovers and the rural markets and consumption goes back to its normal beat. However, in the last two years, very little has been done for the urban poor. During the pandemic, restaurants, hotels and tourism have been impacted in a big way. We have been talking to the government that we need to look at a MGNREGA equivalent for the urban poor. The same can be customised to the urban needs.According to a Sebi requirement, the CMD post will have to be split. What’s the status of that?According to Sebi’s directive, we have to implement it before April 1, and HUL will always comply with the law of the land.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/need-mgnrega-scheme-for-urban-poor-hul-chief/articleshow/89081571.cms||Namrata Singh

However, much to the relief of hundreds of first-class cricketers, umpires and the scorers, TOI can confirm that the Board is still mulling options to hold the league phase of the traditional tournament before the IPL, and play the knockouts later.A top BCCI official that this paper spoke to said that the Board is “trying its best” to organize the Ranji Trophy this season. “Provided the covid situation stays in control, we’re keen, hopeful, and trying our best to organize the Ranji Trophy. If we start the Ranji Trophy by, say February 10, we can complete the league phase in a month, well ahead of the IPL.The knockouts can be played post the IPL. We are thinking of two options: Either go back to the zonal format, to prevent teams from travelling too much, or we stick to the previous formula of playing the tournament in neutral bio-bubbles, as was originally planned,” a top BCCI official told this paper on Saturday. “The Ranji can even be held in cities and towns where the situation is improving. For example, the number of cases are coming down steadily in Mumbai. Dharamshala and Pondicherry could be a good options,” he added.A state association official said, “Almost all the state associations want the Ranji Trophy, which couldn’t be held due to Covid-19 last time, to be held this time. We’re just waiting for a week more to see if the number of cases come down in this period,” he said. Perhaps, this is why the BCCI has still not come out with an official statement announcing the cancellation of this year’s Ranji Trophy so far.“A major reason why the Ranji Trophy needs to be held is that the supply line to India’s Test team is getting affected majorly. You need immediate replacements in theTest team. If the Ranji Trophy isn’t there, how do the national selectors know who are the players in form in red ball cricket?,” said a source.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/bcci-still-mulling-options-to-hold-ranji-league-phase/articleshow/89081576.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Covid-19: At 50.2k, Karnataka reports highest-ever 1-day positive cases||BENGALURU: Karnataka on Sunday reported the highest-ever single-day spike in Covid-19 cases — 50,210 — surpassing the second-wave peak of 50,112 and pushed active cases beyond the 3.5-lakh mark for the first time since May 2021. Of the 50,210 cases reported on Sunday, 26,299 were from Bengaluru, which had reported its single-day highest number on January 20 (30,540). As reported by TOI last week, the share of fresh cases from districts outside Bengaluru continued to increase with 29 of them accounting for 23,911 cases on Sunday. The total number of infections in the state is now beyond 35 lakh, while overall fatalities, including 19 on Sunday, stood at 38,582. Of the 19 deaths on Sunday, Bengaluru reported eight, Shivamogga and Tumakuru two each, and seven districts one fatality each. Health minister K Sudhakar, earlier in the day, said: "Going by the primary observations in the past two or three days, the test positivity rate in Bengaluru, which has the highest caseload in the state, has been reducing. While it is too early to say if we've peaked, we could come to a conclusion if the trend continues. Now, the cases outside Bengaluru are slowly increasing." Just as cases in Bengaluru trail big cities like Mumbai and Delhi, infections in the districts trail that of the state's capital, he said, adding "the situation is expected to stabilise in the next two-three weeks". In the past 24 hours the state conducted 2.2 lakh tests, including 44,122 rapid antigen tests (RAT), of which 50,210 returned positive, putting the test positivity rate for the day at 22.7%. "However, one has to look at some other indicators to realise that the situation is being handled efficiently in the state," an official said. Separate data accessed from the state war room shows that as of January 23, only 5,164 people of the more than 3.5 lakh active cases were in hospitals. Of these, 550 were in ICU and ICU-ventilator beds cumulatively, while another 1,048 were in high dependency unit (HDU) beds that require oxygen. The remaining were in general beds. Further, in the past 24 hours, the state has added 48 active containment zones, with only one added in Bengaluru. Overall, as on date, there are 385 containment zones, of which 319 are from outside Bengaluru. The recovery rate in the state continues to remain high at more than 92.1% for the past week, while the fatality rate is only 0.05%. In the last 24 hours, the recovery rate was at 88.7%, while fatality rate was 0.03%. "Growth rate of Covid cases in the past 24 hours is 15.4%, while there it is -25.3% for the last week," the war room said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/at-50-2k-karnataka-reports-highest-ever-1-day-ve-cases/articleshow/89081583.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||300 lakes in records, but not on ground in 7 districts under Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority||HYDERABAD: Nearly 10% of lakes in Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA) jurisdiction is either missing on the ground or yet to be located. While the lakes are in the revenue records, the irrigation department is struggling to find and demarcate them. Of the 3,532 lakes in seven districts under HMDA, about 300 are untraceable. Of these 300 lakes, Ranga Reddy accounts for the highest at about 100 and Medchal-Malkajgiri district around 50. HMDA metropolitan commissioner and special chief secretary Arvind Kumar, however, said, "We have the data on all the lakes. Physical verification, especially with respect to their extent, is being taken up." But with identification becoming a problem, collectors of these seven districts have asked the irrigation department to send information certifying lakes that are non-existent and reasons. The collectors want to recommend them for deletion from the lakes list. For instance, 17 lakes in Shamshabad, 14 in Balapur mandal, 13 in Maheshwaram, 12 in Abdullapurmet and 19 lakes in Shabad mandal were reported as non-existent. "The prime reason for lakes not being found is that hundreds of colonies have come up by filing them up in HMDA jurisdiction, especially in Ranga Reddy and Medchal-Malkajgiri district over past two decades. As several lakes are only in revenue records, a joint survey of revenue and irrigation departments was earlier ordered. The officers have to physically visit the place, survey the lake extent and fix up the Full Tank Level (FTL)," a member of the lakes protection committee said. Even among the identified lakes, there are discrepancies in extent and boundaries in both revenue and irrigation records. The district collectors data was inaccurate as same lakes are given different identification numbers. According to sources, there are 895 such cases (lakes) within HMDA limits. Officials said that collectors sent information about 2,857 lakes, but after HMDA collected information from revenue and irrigation authorities, this count increased to 3,532. Of these, physically survey has been completed for 3,114 lakes. Initially, after survey of lakes, the details are notified preliminarily. After receiving full information from revenue and irrigation departments as well as maps, the final notification is issued.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/300-lakes-in-records-but-not-on-ground-in-7-dists-under-hmda/articleshow/89081601.cms||Koride Mahesh

Anthony Singh, Kishan Ekka and Ranjan Tirki, all labourers, had got into a fight with Hanumanthnagar resident Murugan R while partying at their labour camp in Bilishivale near Kothanur. Murugan, who had suffered injuries, died on January 7 and the accused had fled the city, said police. Police said that a group of construction labourers decided to have a party on January 1 as there was a ban on public celebrations on the night of December 31. Murugan too was partying with his friend Anirudh in the same area and was disturbed by the group as they were making a lot of noise. He and his friend warned them not to create commotion. However, as the group didn’t bother to pay heed, Murugan lost his cool and thrashed a few labourers with a cricket bat. Later, he again went to the labourers in an inebriated state. This time, the labourers retaliated by assaulting him with a bat and fled the spot. Murugan sustained a head injury. The incident came to light around 8.30am next morning when an operator of an earth excavator found him. “Investigation revealed that a few more are involved in the murder and efforts are on to nab them,” said Anoop A Shetty, deputy commissioner of police (northeast). tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/3-arrested-from-assam-for-murdering-youth/articleshow/89081607.cms||---

The man was trying to fly out of Bengaluru to Dubai, but was caught with the large amount of cash. Sources with Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) said the smuggling attempt took place on Friday evening when the suspect landed in Bengaluru from Mumbai on a domestic flight. Following specific information to the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence’s Bengaluru team about a foreign-currency smuggling attempt, officers concerned alerted their Customs counterparts at KIA who them combed for the suspect and intercepted him when he attempted to board a Flydubai flight from the airport. When questioning yielded no result, they recalled his checked-in bag and removed the contents to find a hard portion at the bottom of the trolley bag. The investigators cut it open only to find numerous US dollar bills and other currency notes. The passenger, whose identity has not been revealed due to an ongoing probe, has been arrested for the smuggling, sources said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/man-caught-with-foreign-currency-at-kia/articleshow/89081609.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Engineering graduates too can apply for schoolteacher posts||BENGALURU: The state government, through its latest draft notification on appointment of schoolteachers for classes 6-8, has allowed engineering graduates to apply for posts of graduate primary teacher. The notification titled Karnataka Education Department Services (Department of Public Instructions) Recruitment (Special) Rules-2022, was released on January 20. Objections to the draft can be sent to the principal secretary of education. The government plans to hire 15,000 teachers to fill vacant posts, with a pay scale of Rs 14,550 to Rs 26,700. As per the notification, the minimum qualification for appointment is graduation. The candidate should have a graduate degree with a minimum of 50% marks and a two-year diploma in elementary education or a bachelor’s degree in education/special education. The candidate can be a PU graduate with minimum 50% aggregate marks and have a four-year bachelor of elementary education/education degree. S/he should pass the Teacher Eligibility Test. For maths and science teachers, engineering graduates can apply, and so can architecture graduates who have studied maths in first three or four semesters and applied maths in the rest of the semesters. They should have scored 50% marks in these subjects separately and must have practised teaching/method of teaching at least in one of the subjects in diploma or bachelor’s degree in teacher education. This is a notable change that has been brought into the recruitment rules. “Foreign countries open up avenues for passionate people committed to education at any point in their career — young or mid-career. India used to have a fixed pathway to get people into teaching. Instead, we should also allow more avenues. As long as candidates understand the philosophical, pedagogical, and psychological aspects of teaching and are trained in the art and science of teaching, even engineering candidates can be good teachers for students in these grades,” said Maya Menon, founder-director, Teacher Foundation. Graduates who have studied maths and physics compulsorily along with any of chemistry, computer science, electronics, statistics, geography, geology, and biotechnology as third optional subject can also teach maths and science in these classes. For language posts, the candidate should have learnt the language as well as another optional subject such as Kannada, English, Tamil, Telegu, Malayalam, sociology, political science, or geography. The candidate should also have practised teaching in diploma or bachelor’s degree in teacher education. The draft notification has qualifications mentioned for biological sciences as well as social sciences. The general candidate should be within the age group of 21 and 40.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/engineering-graduates-too-can-apply-for-schoolteacher-posts/articleshow/89081610.cms||---

At present, the runway can cater only to microlight planes. The event saw the government unveil a new twin-engine plane purchased for the training school.

Some of the earliest employees had received the options at as low as Rs 10 apiece. Those who were granted options about four years ago got them at Rs 11,600 each.Online meat delivery company Licious said starting January, all its eligible employees will have their ESOPs vested daily.

T Sadagopan, 62, residing at Avadi, got a message that he had been successfully vaccinated on Friday evening. When Sadagopan logged into the CoWIN portal, he found his vaccine certificate for a precaution dose he didn’t get. "I have no idea how it was possible without me sharing my mobile number, one time password (OTP) or Aadhaar number. So, when I called up the primary health centre's nurse, she advised me to ignore the SMS and asked me to arrive at the centre in case I wanted to get vaccinated," he said. Avadi Municipal Commissioner R Saraswathi was unavailable for comment. However, state health secretary J Radhakrishnan said that he will direct the authorities concerned to look into the issue. M Somasundaram, who got his booster shot at a PHC in Anna Nagaron Thursday, said the Co-WIN portal suggests that two booster doses were administered for his registered mobile number. "Even if one extra dose was recorded at each of the 5,000 vaccination centres in Chennai, it would give us a wrong projection. When I asked, Greater Chennai Corporation authorities said that they will show the extra dose as wastage," he said. K Baskar, an activist from Thiruvallur, said the authorities simply cite server issues for such flaws. Such mix-ups were common even when people took their second doses; some took the jab thrice to get their certificates, he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/mix-ups-over-booster-doses-upset-seniors/articleshow/89081619.cms||Ram Sundaram

Oceanic Tropical Fruits Private Limited (OTFPL), Pepsico's co-packer for their product Slice, had taken loans amounting to 274.3 crore loans from three banks – State Bank of India, ICICI and Central Bank of India. As the loans weren’t repaid, the banks declared them non-performing assets. But auditors later found out that the company's directors – A Joseb Raj, Vimala Joseb and James Walter (personal guarantor) – diverted the loan funds. The company submitted fake vouchers and transaction details to divert the money, according to an FIR filed by the CBI on Thursday. OTFPL used another firm, KK Foods (KKF), to collect receivables or debts from its consumers. The banks found out that KKF had actually collected the receivables but did not credit them in OTFPL's accounts. OTFPL was primarily involved in processing mango into pulp and concentrate and KKF acted as intermediary with mango suppliers. When the banks reviewed KKF's ledger account, they found 86 out of the 429 transactions were inconsistent. The firm claimed that it used private vehicles to transport 10,000 kilograms of mangoes. But when the banks cross-checked the registration numbers, they were found to be of two-wheelers and not trucks. So the banks in 2019 declared the company's activities as fraudulent and authorised SBI's Stress Assets Management Branch to act on it. S Ravichandran, the branch's deputy general manager, confirmed the banks' findings and complained to the CBI.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/cbi-books-firm-for-defrauding-banks-of-271cr/articleshow/89081621.cms||Ram Sundaram

Apart from regular migratory birds, a couple of duck species too have come to Vedanthangal, said K V R K Thirunaranan, founder of Nature Trust who is monitoring migratory birds in Pallikaranai marshland, Vedanthangal and Pulicat birds sanctuaries. Shovelers and pin-tailed ducks are the ones that have made Vedanthangal their home for the time being. In Karikili, a smaller sanctuary near Vedanthangal, one can see fulvous whistling duck and lesser whistling teal, along with a small population of Indian spot-billed ducks. With the Karikili tank brimming, however, sighting the migratory ducks will be very difficult. These ducks travel thousands of kilometres from Central Asia to reach Vedanthangal, he said. On visitors, Prasant said the crowd is thin on weekdays. Only on Fridays and Saturdays are footfall any bigger. During Christmas and New Year holidays last month, there was significant number of visitors, he added. With plenty of water available in the tank, the birds are expected to stay at least till the end of March , bird watchers said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/vedanthangal-turns-sea-of-birds/articleshow/89081622.cms||P Oppili

An audit of people who died due to Covid 19 showed that nearly seven out of 10 people had not taken the vaccine. Among vaccinated people of all age groups, comorbidities, especially uncontrolled diabetes and hypertension, posed a great threat, said director of public health Dr T S Selva Vinayagam, whose department audited medical reports of 1,411 people who died of Covid-19 between October 1 and January 16. Case sheets of 44 (3%) people were set aside as their vaccine status was unknown. Of the 1,367 deceased, 976 (70%) were unvaccinated, among which 811 were above 50 years with comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, renal or heart diseases and cancer. Though the state has vaccinated nearly 90% of its population above the age of 18 with one dose and 67% with two, a large number of the vulnerable population remain without vaccine protection. Of the 10.4 crore people above 60 years, nearly 37 lakh haven’t taken even one dose of the vaccine. “It is important to take both the doses of the vaccine. The elderly with comorbid conditions must take the precautionary dose as well,” Selva Vinayagam said. Among the 172 people who died after taking one dose, 135 were above 50 years with comorbid conditions. This is not the first time the state has witnessed evidence of vaccine benefits. Of the 88,719 people who tested positive in Tamil Nadu between August and September 2021, at least 63% did not take any vaccine, 24% were partially vaccinated and 13% were fully vaccinated. As for ICU admissions and deaths, nearly 87% of deaths and 76% of ICU admissions were among those who were unvaccinated against Covid-19. The present analysis showed that the number of deceased who had taken both doses of the vaccine dropped to 234. “Even among this group, nearly 217 people above 50 years had comorbid conditions,” said health secretary J Radhakrishnan. In double vaccinated people below 50 years, nine with comorbid conditions died compared with three without comorbid conditions. “While vaccines provide immediate benefits, there is a need for keeping NCDs under control in the long term,” he said. The state hopes to cover a large number of people with NCDs under the Makkalai thedi maruthuvam scheme.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/data-highlight-need-to-focus-on-curbing-comorbidities/articleshow/89081623.cms||---

The petitioner, P Amos Roger Wilfred of Anna Nagar moved the tribunal seeking a compensation of ₹4.25 crore.

On the past two Sundays, passengers who arrived in the city in trains were forced to pay triple the normal fare to reach their destinations as public transport was not operated. To resolve the issue this week, the traffic police held a meeting with auto and cab drivers' unions. They were advised to follow only the government-approved fares and submit prepaid bills as proof during vehicle checks. While prepaid services were largely kept under check, app-based cab services were still costly. The demand was high as many drivers did not come to duty on Sunday. Hence, some of them had to take two-wheeler taxis, which cost 30% to 40% less. Therefore, the affected public have requested the MTC to operate skeletal bus services during the next Sunday lockdown.

Tiruvallur superintendent of police Varun Kumar unveiled the board at the spot where the dog was buried. Rambo, a doberman, had helped police in solving many criminal cases. In a double murder case in Tiruvallur district in December 2019, he showed the police the possible escape routes the assailants could have taken.

He retired on March 22, 2019, due to health ailments. He was 12. He was inducted into the force after undergoing basic training at Chennai city dog training centre.

Given the increase in the enrollment in government schools by eight lakh students during the pandemic, the government is planning to recruit 4,989 teachers, including 3,902 secondary grade teachers and 1,087 graduate teachers, for the state-run schools this year. According to the annual planner, the TRB would conduct six recruitment drives and a Teacher Eligibility Test (TET) in 2022. The planner was released by school education minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi on Sunday. The board is planning to conduct the postgraduate teachers recruitment test in the second or third week of February. The TET exam will be conducted in the second week of April after a gap of two years. As per a government order, the board also will conduct its first recruitment test for the appointment of secondary grade teachers and graduate teachers among the TET qualified candidates in the second week of June. Earlier, the weightage system was followed for appointing TET qualified candidates as secondary grade and graduate teachers. It was replaced with a recruitment test. Further, as the government arts and science colleges too face severe faculty shortage, the TRB will recruit 1,334 more assistant professors this year. "This is in addition to the 2,331 vacancies notified by the TRB in 2019. The recruitment will be completed in 2022," an TRB official said.

---||Chennai||Chennai: Telecom firms damage new footpaths, roads, irk locals||CHENNAI: Newly laid footpaths and roads in the city are being damaged by telecom companies who dig where they will to set up their poles and lay their cables, complain residents and activists. On Saturday, after protests from residents, Greater Chennai Corporation officials ordered removal of poles erected by a telecom company on Radhakrishna Nagar main road in Adyar damaging the footpaths. The residents also filed a complaint online. The telecom companies are expanding infrastructure to cater to the increased demand in view of work from home. However, the city does not have a proper policy to regulate their activities. Permission is often given to lay poles or underground cables from one point to another without specifying the number of poles or where they should be installed or the number of spots that can be dug up. Worse, each firm sets up its own maze of poles and cables. There is no provision for them to share at least the poles. The provision for ducts on footpaths to lay utility cables began in 2018. However, these are either incomplete or do not provide channels to give connections to houses. The civic body collects Rs 56,100 as rent for every km of cabling. It wanted a rent of Rs 5,500 per pole, but the telcos objected. The state government too was not keen on imposing too many rules fearing disruption of internet services during the lockdown. The telecom companies have now set up more than 1.50 lakh poles across the city. A random survey in 2020 found that at least 1,500km of cables were laid without permission. Geeta Padmanabhan, who filed a complaint against a company for erecting poles, said lack of guidelines was the problem. “Footpaths get blocked, utilities get damaged and poles are installed haphazardly, making the city ugly. We want the civic body to make the policy and permissions accorded public on its website,” she said. Many unauthorized poles were removed in 2019 in areas such as R K Nagar, Mandaveli, Mogappair and Kodambakkam after residents and activists raised their voice. A representative from a telecom company said they cannot share poles with other service providers. “We pay the Greater Chennai corporation rent for the cable length and we are doing this only for the public. We don’t want to cause any inconvenience,” he said. Pugazhvendhan, a civic activist, said officials do not conduct inspections after according permissions. Deputy commissioner, revenue and finance, Vishu Mahajan told TOI that the electrical department issues permissions every year for laying these cables. “A proposal to regularize the setting up of poles has been sent to the government. Once it is cleared, the guidelines can be made public. However, whenever complaints are raised, we remove the poles,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/telecom-firms-damage-new-footpaths-roads-irk-locals/articleshow/89081631.cms||---

The quarters has 300 houses, 140 of which are occupied. The corporation floated tenders and finalised contractors to lay the road connecting TIC Road and the Rail Vihar. However, Ambattur Tahsildar intervened saying the corporation should not proceed with the work as the area outside the Rail Vihar was a lake. On December 28, superintending engineer of Ambattur zone wrote to the Tahilsdar and the Chennai metropolitan development authority, citing the area between TIC road and Railvihar, coming under ward 85, was indeed the city corporation’s land and that it would lay and maintain the road. The civic body is awaiting a response from CMDA before proceeding to lay the road. “During rains, the mud path gets swampy,” said M Thangaraj, president of Ambattur Rail Vihar Owners’ Welfare Association (ARVOWA). Dheenadhayalan S, the association secretary, too echoed the concerns.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/residents-of-retd-railway-staff-quarters-seek-connecting-road/articleshow/89081633.cms||Omjasvin M D
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Ambulance driver kills colleague in Chengalpet||CHENNAI: An ambulance driver killed his colleague, who had alerted their employer about his drinking habit while on duty, at Chengalpet on Sunday. Police said the deceased, Vijayakumar, 33 of KK Nagar, was employed as a driver for the past 15 years under Saravanan, who ran a company that rented out ambulances. Vijayakumar used to stay in a room allotted to him by his employer at Periyar Nagar, along with fellow drivers Ajith, 30, Dharmadurai, 25, and Raja, 31, police said. Last month, Vijayakumar had verbally complained to his employer that Ajith used to drive the ambulance under the influence of alcohol. Ajith was reprimanded by his employer and was warned against repeating this. After the rebuke, Ajith used to pick up fights with Vijayakumar for his complaint. On Saturday night, Vijayakumar was asleep in his room along with the other drivers when a fight broke out between him and Ajith, police said. At 1 am, the ambulance owner called up Ajith and asked him to deliver a freezer box at Nemili and return immediately. Before leaving home, Ajith, in a fit of rage, dropped a grinding stone on Vijayakumar's head, who was asleep at the time of the attack. The other drivers Dharmadurai and Raja were asleep after getting drunk. Ajith then went out to handover the freezer box and returned early on Sunday morning. He woke up his friends and claimed that he found Vijayakumar lying in a pool of blood, and suspected that some miscreants entered the house while he was away and killed Vijayakumar. He and his colleagues alerted his employer, who informed Chengalpet town police. Vijayakumar’s body was sent for a post mortem to Chengalpet government hospital. Ajith had deep injuries on his head. When police interrogated Ajith, he feigned innocence at first, but later confessed to have committed the murder. Ajith was arrested and remanded in judicial custody.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/ambulance-driver-kills-colleague/articleshow/89081634.cms||---

The victim, Anandan, 36, of Vadakambadi village in Mamallapuram, was into construction material business at Thirukazhukundram. Last week, he received a call asking for construction material to build a cemetery. The caller said he wanted M-sand and bricks for the purpose. Believing the caller to be a genuine buyer, Anandan took the material to the designated place, where a man who identified himself as the caller asked him get into a car in order to get the cash. A little later, four other men boarded the car. One of them brandished a knife and asked Anandan to call up his wife and ask for 5 lakh as ransom. Anandan called up his wife Nithya, 30, who informed 'Karate' Saravanan, a sculptor who owned a shop adjacent to Anandan’s. Saravanan convinced Nithya to pay 2 lakh to the abductors. Nithya accompanied Saravanan to hand over the cash. At Vayalur, she paid the gang the money and got Anandan back. The couple then reached Mamallapuram police station, when Saravanan told Anandan not to include him as a witness in the case. Anandan became suspicious, and informed police who later checked his call records, and found that he had been continuously in touch with the kidnappers. After interrogating him for over an hour, police said Saravanan was the main accused who hatched the plan to extort money from the businessman. With the help of the inputs given by him, they nabbed Moorthy, 40 of Manimangalam, Vijayakumar, 39 of Aallikuppam, Arjun, 35 of Semmenchery, Ranjithkumar, 30 of Mylai and Mahendran, 40 of the same locality.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/six-held-for-kidnapping-businessman/articleshow/89081639.cms||---

As the agency decided to seek custody, he was brought from Bengaluru and lodged in a city jail, ED sources said . ED had booked a case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) based on first information reports (FIRs) registered by Central Crime Station, Hyderabad. ED had probed the routing of crime proceeds amounting to hundreds of crores in the fraud. In one of the cases, police had accused Karvy management of availing credit facilities of 137 crore by pledging securities of clients with IndusInd Bank. The securities of clients, without their consent, were transferred into demat account of Karvy company and pledged with the bank. Investigations found that Karvy had turned into a defaulter and diverted the funds into sister companies. Parthasarathy is also the director of Karvy Reality (India) Private Limited. ED had earlier issued a freezing order of shares of the accused, worth around 700 crore according to the valuation report, in the Karvy fraud. ED said that the total loans taken by Karvy were estimated to be around 3,000 crore. Prima facie investigation revealed 1,096 crore was transferred by KSBL to its group company Karvy Realty (India) Ltd between 2016 and 2019. ED probe had also found deletion of files and emails from servers by using anti-forensic tools under the instructions of prime accused Parthasarathy. ED had earlier conducted searches at six Karvy Stock Broking Limited locations and froze shares of Karvy Group held by Parthasarathy, his sons Rajat and Adhiraj Parthasarathy. ED had also issued ECIR under the PMLA based on FIRs by CCS police on the complaint of HDFC Bank alleging that KSBL illegally pledged the securities of its clients and taken a loan of 329 crore.

Besides, the party has also lodged a complaint with the ECI accusing BJP leaders and workers of violating the model code of conduct to campaign for the party in Kairana assembly constituency and other areas. Demanding action against those responsible for violations, SP has sought strictures against such events. The complaint comes a day after Union home minister Amit Shah kicked off the party's door-to-door campaign, visiting families affected by the alleged exodus of Hindus from Kairana before 2017. In the complaint, lodged by SP national secretary Rajendra Chaudhary, it was stated that in Shamli’s Kairana and several other assembly constituencies, BJP leaders and part workers are campaigning with more than 10 people in open violation of the Model Code of Conduct and guidelines issued by EC in wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. In a separate letter addressed to the Chief Election Commissioner, party’s state president Naresh Uttam Patel stated that several news channels are airing opinion polls which are leaving the voters confused and thus influencing the elections in a complete violation of the model code. In the interest of independent, free and fair elections, telecast of such opinion polls by news channels must be immediately stopped, the letter demanded. SP national secretary Rajendra Chaudhary told TOI that opinion and exit polls are not to be aired once the election notification is issued as they tend to confuse the voters and can eventually influence their choice of vote. “EC should keep a check on such activities and not wait for political parties to lodge a complaint.

KTR has urged the FM to sanction additional nodes at Mancherial (3,000 acres) under the Hyderabad-Nagpur corridor, Huzurabad as part of the Hyderabad-Vijayawada corridor and Jadcherla-Gadwal-Kothaguda node under the Hyderabad-Bengaluru corridor. He has sought provision of 5,000 crore for these three nodes in the budget estimates for 2022-23, including 2,000 crore for Mancherial and 1,500 crore each for Huzurabad and Jadcherla-Gadwal-Kothaguda nodes. On the approved nodes at Hyderabad Pharma City and NIMZ Zaheerabad under the Hyderabad-Warangal and Hyderabad-Nagpur corridors, that the Centre has agreed to fund, KTR has asked for a budgetary provision of 2,000 crore each. He has also sought release of grant in aid of over 5,000 crore for the master planning as well as development of internal, external and technical infrastructure for the establishment of Hyderabad Pharma City as a NIMZ in Rangareddy district. KTR has also made a pitch to Sitharaman to include Hyderabad in the proposed defence industrial production corridor.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/ktr-seeks-14k-cr-for-key-projects/articleshow/89081668.cms||---

Santosh was shifted to Gandhi Hospital by locals immediately.At a press conference on Sunday, additional commissioner of police (law & order), DS Chauhan, said that during the investigation, police came to know that Nawaz and Santosh were friends and both used to reside in Warasiguda. Four years ago, the victim had relocated to Keesara. The rift between the victim and the accused began three years ago, when Santosh questioned Nawaz for beating up a child. The two had frequent arguments over the issue and the accused bore a grudge against Santosh.On Saturday night at 9 pm, when the accused came across the victim in Warasiguda, the former intimidated the victim by driving an autorickshaw close to the victim and stopping him. Again at 12.30 am on Sunday, when the victim was returning home, the accused and two others stopped him and stabbed him with a knife. Police arrested all three accused in the case.Similarly, in another case at Begumpet, the victim, Pradeep Kumar along with his friends went to meet Pradeep’s friend Raghavendra at 3 am on Sunday at Rasoolpura.

However, later, the accused left the place. After some time, when the victim was returning home, the accused stopped him again and picked up an argument. This time, he was joined by six more persons, some of whom were in an inebriated condition. The accused stabbed Pradeep in the stomach. The victim, however, managed to reach the police station and the police shifted him to Gandhi Hospital.

Officials said that the minister will lay the foundation at Alkapur. The phase-2 works, estimated to cost around 587 crore, would include providing potable drinking water to all residential units, layouts and gated communities in panchayats, municipalities, and municipal corporations inside ORR. The Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply & Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) had announced that they would provide drinking water to 272 colonies within ORR by March-end. Under the phase-2 works, 535 km has been targeted to be completed by February-end. Under this project, around 20 lakh households were expected to receive connections in addition to the existing 1.5 lakh connections. Officials said they were also keeping in mind that the population in the region could increase to over 33 lakh in near future.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/ktr-to-launch-water-supply-works-for-orr/articleshow/89081673.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||5 years on, 200 water ATMs non-functional in Hyderabad||HYDERABAD: The water ATMs, which were launched amid much fanfare across the city five years ago, have been gathering dust despite residents’ pleas to revive them. There are around 200 automatic water vending machines (AWVMs) which now stand useless due to broken pipes, stolen tumblers and broken coin slots. TOI checked water ATM kiosks in BS Maktha, Goshamahal in Old City, NTR Marg, Karmanghat, Sanathnagar and Yousufguda and found them defunct. GHMC officials said they were trying to fix the problem and have even approached corporate companies for CSR funds. However, nothing has been done to address the issue. “With the summer approaching, the water ATMs will be a boon for people if only the officials could fix them. A can of the same drinking water is commercially sold from Rs 30 to Rs 40. We can fill our bottles for Rs 2 if the AWVMs are functional,” Rajdeep Varma, a resident of BS Maktha, told TOI. The initiative was kicked off in January 2017 with 114 water ATMs in collaboration with Josab International AB of Sweden and Natures Spring Eco Tap Private Limited. In less than a year, the entire water ATM network went kaput due to lack of maintenance and civic sense. “The water ATMs are down and the issue was raised with GHMC multiple times. But, nothing much was done to rectify the problem. Clearly, the GHMC did not pay attention before going ahead with the initiative, especially when it comes to its maintenance,” Harish Daga, a city-based social activist, told TOI. Ironically, the water ATMs became such a hit among the public that the GHMC had even planned to add another 300 kiosks across the city. However, considering the failure of the initiative, the corporation dropped the proposal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/5-yrs-on-200-water-atms-non-functional/articleshow/89081674.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

In addition to these, Hiranandani family office -- Pegasus, Sandeep Singhal of Avaana Capital and Limeroad co-founder Prashant Malik also participated in the funding round along with a clutch of angel investors. This round also includes an undisclosed quantum of debt funding from N+1 Capital, which provides revenue-based growth capital. In addition to the $20 million Series-A, StanPlus has also raised $2 million from Grip Invest that it will be utilising for leasing ambulances. StanPlus founder & CEO Prabhdeep Singh told TOI that the capital infusion will be leveraged to scale up operations to 500 hospitals and ramp up the presence of its flagship Red Ambulance services in 15 markets from the existing five cities. “In India, grocery is delivered in 10 minutes but ambulances take 45 minutes. At StanPlus, we are focusing on the 8-minute ambulance paradigm – I like to call it the ‘First Minute, Last Mile’ healthcare. The capital will allow us to scale across India, bring amazing talent to work on this mission, and build world-first technologies,” Singh said. Elaborating on its decision to invest in StanPlus, Kalaari Capital’s managing director Vani Kola, said that while there has been a lot of buzz around quick-commerce and 15-minute grocery delivery, Stanplus is one company that has made 15-minute emergency healthcare services a reality in India. Pointing out that fatality rates for road traffic accidents as well as cardiac and neurological emergencies in India are significantly higher than in the developed world primarily due to the lack of efficient medical emergency response systems, Charles Antoine Janssen, CIO, HealthQuad, said the innovative, tech-enabled platform developed by StanPlus can be rapidly scaled up and has the potential to save millions of lives. Singh said StanPlus is on track to close the current fiscal 2021-22 with revenues of around $10 million (Rs 75 crore) and is targeting 3X growth in the coming fiscal year. The emergency response industry in India is valued at around $15 billion.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/city-health-startup-stanplus-raises-20m/articleshow/89081675.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

---||Hyderabad||'Herbal & natural do not always mean safe': Used to fight Covid, Giloy can lead to liver failure||HYDERABAD: Consumed indiscriminately as an immunity booster — since the onset of Covid-19 — Giloy (Tinospora cordifolia) can do more harm than good to the liver, a recent study by researchers from India’s leading institutions have found. Apart from causing injury, it can even lead to liver failure in some cases, the study states. The multi-centre research spanning 13 cities including Hyderabad, was conducted by a team of scientists and liver specialists and published in the scientific journal, Hepatology Communications. This all-India team comprised researchers from the hepatology and liver transplantation department of the Asian Institute of Gastroenterology, Hyderabad, as well. “We reported 43 patients, of whom more than half were female, with a median time from initial Giloy consumption to symptom onset of 46 days. Patients presented with acute hepatitis, acute worsening of chronic liver disease, which was the most common clinical presentation, or acute liver failure. Causality assessment revealed probable liver injury in 67.4%,” the study stated. Used by many to fight Covid-19 infection, Giloy is marketed as an herbal supplement. “Liver biopsy in a subset revealed herb-induced liver injury associated with autoimmune features… Giloy is associated with acute hepatitis with autoimmune features… Further studies on the safety (and efficacy) of untested but heavily promoted herbals… are an unmet need in the interests of public health and are especially important during this global health emergency,” the study warned. The researchers also stated that in India “there is still widespread ‘non-evidence based’ use of investigational drugs (such as Ivermectin), dietary supplements (such as vitamin C, D, and zinc), and complementary and alternative medicines, including those promoted for ‘prevention’ of Covid-19.” The research team called for rigorous studies on the safety and efficacy of commonly used herbal formulations. “The fact that ‘herbal’ and ‘natural’ do not mean ‘safe’ is illustrated yet again in this series of patients. Public health authorities must take necessary steps not to promote herbal formulations based on traditional beliefs but rather to educate the public regarding the potential liver toxicity of untested herbal products,” the researchers suggested.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/used-to-fight-covid-giloy-can-lead-to-liver-failure/articleshow/89081677.cms||Syed Akbar

Unlike the first wave when Covid-19 affected households were being sealed and stigmatised, people are now united by the pandemic with many taking up the responsibility to help each other. Covid-hit families, who are under home isolation are getting a helping hand from next door or across the fence. Residents in many gated communities and colonies are delivering daily meals, medicines among other essential items to affected families by following Covid protocols like social distancing. “I had an old couple living next to me. Their children live in the US. Both of them were affected and were not very tech-savvy to use online food delivery platforms. When I got to know about this, I decided to extend help by serving them food every day,” said Madhav Rao, a resident of East Marredpally. Many residents living in gated communities have also come forward to help those who are in need. “We have a common WhatsApp group, where affected families put up their request for food and preferences such as vegetarian/non vegetarian, south Indian or north Indian. Accordingly, the home cooks come forward to help them and deliver the food through our security staff to the respective houses,” said Gopi Alisetty, general secretary of My Home Avatar. Not just this, increasing number of people are delivering food for free of cost to Covid-19 affected people. Many of them are those who had offered similar services during the second wave.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/for-covid-hit-families-people-are-a-call-away/articleshow/89081678.cms||---

This has resulted in a huge surge in demand for home healthcare services. Currently, more than 31,000 people are under treatment and isolation across the state. Several hospitals offering home healthcare packages are flooded with enquiries, especially from families with children, elderly and members with comorbidities. “In the last three weeks, we have observed an huge rise in number of people seeking home healthcare. We are receiving 80-100 enquiries every day. This includes isolation packages, where we offer tele-consultation and isolation kits and also home healthcare packages where a nurse is offered to take care of the patient,” said Mahesh Joshi, president of Apollo Home Care. With more number of children getting affected during the pandemic, several hospitals are offering specialised home healthcare packages for them. “In this package, a child is assigned a nurse, who keeps the doctor informed about the status of the child. The doctor prescribes medicines accordingly. This apart, oximeter, thermometer and information booklet are offered,” said Dr Anupama Yerra, consultant pediatric intensivist at Rainbow Children’s Hospital.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/home-healthcare-the-new-norm-during-milder-covid-variant-in-t/articleshow/89081680.cms||Preeti Biswas

With the much-needed musi river development and beautification project shelved, the water body continues to die a slow death as it currently stands as a cocktail of sewage, solid and chemical waste. After incurring Rs 2 crore expenditure in the musi rejuvenation project, the Musi River Front Development Corporation Limited (MRDCL) shelved it back on August 28, 2021, after heavy rains washed away their efforts. Officials said that they are preparing a detailed project report and creating a plan to keep all contingencies in mind. This is one amongst a plethora of civic failures pertaining to the Musi river’s pollution problem. Currently, almost nothing is being done to stop the dumping of waste and polluted waste seeping into the river. Even the Rs 5.64 crore rubber dam had failed to filter the waste within three months after its installation, back in 2009 after it became choked with sewage and solid waste. The floating trash barriers set up to block the solid waste from entering downstream too failed as the dumping of trash and seepage of sewage is taking place across the stream. For instance, even the fencing set up on Muslim Jung Pool Bridge has not deterred the public from throwing trash over it. Apart from solid waste being seen in the river stream across Puranapul, Muslim Jung Pool, Salar Jung Pool bridges, the waste can also be seen hanging on the fencing as some of them tend to get stuck on it for months. The MRDCL developed walking and cycling tracks and did landscaping works on the surrounding land. “Today, barely anyone goes there to walk because who wants to get up early in the morning to walk next to stinking sewage. These cosmetic changes mean nothing. The river needs a complete post-mortem,” Mohammed Rizvi, a civic activist told TOI.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/pride-of-city-musi-turns-into-a-cocktail-of-chemical-waste/articleshow/89081681.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

He said the BJP and other opposition parties were creating an issue about the decision for political gains. “Do you think poor people’s children don’t deserve education in English medium?” he asked opposition leaders.In a press conference at Sanga Reddy district headquarters on Sunday, the minister dismissed allegations that there were no teachers in government schools. “The state has sufficient strength of government teachers as per the Right to Education Act. There is scarcity of teachers in BJP ruling states,” Rao said.Instead of criticising the TRS government — which had set up 17 medical colleges — Telangana BJP leaders should try to get 21 Navodaya schools, IIM and tribal university to the state from the Centre, he said.The minister said the government was committed to the welfare of Dalits in the state. “Leaders described Dalit Bandhu as a political scheme and introduced for electoral gains in Huzurabad by-elections. Now, by implementing the scheme in the entire state, the government has proved its commitment,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/eng-medium-in-govt-schools-a-resolution/articleshow/89081685.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Chinese manja grounded these birds for life in Hyderabad||HYDERABAD: Several birds which are permanently handicapped due to sharp injuries caused by Chinese manja are being sent to private shelters across the city, thanks to animal and bird lovers’ initiative. Birds, especially pigeons, entangled in Chinese manja tend to have their wings and feet chopped partially which would eventually require amputation. Soudharm Bhandari, animal welfare officer and founder of Greater Hyderabad Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (GHSPCA), said he alone had catered to 60 such disabled birds. “The life span of a disabled bird reduces drastically to a maximum of six months. Because, even without the wings, they still try vehemently to fly. Flapping their wings continuously results in exhaustion and further injuries resulting in their eventual death,” Bhandari told TOI. Founder of Animal Warriors Conservation Society Pradeep Parakuth, who has been active in rescuing birds affected by Chinese manja, said at least 30 wild birds were permanently disabled this year across the city. “Apart from pigeons and crows, black kites, cattle egrets, barn owls, Asiatic quail and cuckoo hawk have been disabled and handed over to the zoo authorities,” he told TOI. A majority of them had dislocated wing bones and cuts to wings and feet, Pradeep explained. Animal activists said Hyderabad does not have the technology to treat birds with fractures and bone dislocations. Also, while the city has a few animal shelters, there isn’t one exclusively for birds. Activists who rescue common birds like pigeons and crows send them to People For Animals (PFA) shelter in Nagole. Also, a few of them are sent to common animal shelters in Begum Bazar, Medchal and Yakutpura. A considerable number of them are euthanised if the bird is paralysed and suffers from intense pain. Pradeep said that they were planning to set up a shelter for birds and CSR funds have been sought in this regard. “We are looking out for a piece of land or a house to set up the bird shelter,” Pradeep added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/chinese-manja-grounded-these-birds-for-life/articleshow/89081686.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

The capacities of the Vietnam facility, which makes about 13,000-14,000 metric tonnes per annum (mtpa) spray dried coffee for global markets, are expected to double to 26,000 mtpa by the end of 2022, CCL Products CEO Praveen Jaipuriar told TOI. “The doubling of the Vietnam capacities will take our total capacities to 50,000-55,000 mtpa and help fuel our growth in the next 2-3 years,” he said. Elaborating on the reasons for expanding in Vietnam, Jaipuriar pointed out that Vietnam not only offers a tariff advantage for exports but is also a strong coffee growing country, which means the proximity to the raw material also cuts down on freight costs. Currently, CCL has a total capacity of 36,000-37,000 mtpa, a chunk of which is exported. This includes 25,000 mtpa in India across plants at Duggirala, Vijayawada, that makes 18,000-20,000 mtpa freeze dried and spray dried coffee, and a new facility at Chittoor near Sri City that makes 5,000-6,000 mtpa of freeze dried coffee. Having clocked revenues of around 1,242 crore in financial year 2020-21, CCL is now eyeing revenues of around 1,600 crore in the current fiscal. While B2B business is growing about 17-18% this fiscal, its domestic retail brands are growing about 40%.

A year has passed, nothing has been done. TMC should not talk about Netaji’s legacy.”State BJP spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya was critical of the proposed Planning Commission in Bengal. “They had been funding clubs, now they will fund tea stalls. The state will further borrow from the market and people will see mounting debts.”“There was a proposal to form a battalion of police in the name of Netaji. That is yet to be formed.

---||Kolkata||Thakur’s meet: BJP duo showcaused for attendance||Kolkata: A week after Bengal BJP’s former vice-presidents, Ritesh Tiwari and Jayprakash Majumdar, were seen attending a meeting with Union minister Shantanu Thakur along with several other dissenting leaders, the duo was sent show-cause notice for making statements against the party. Both Tiwari and Majumdar were seen at several meetings of the dissenting leaders, who were vocal against the recent organizational shuffle.While BJP termed it an internal issue, the two leaders said they did not need to prove their loyalty to the party. Thakur on Sunday claimed that many “disgruntled and deprived” members and leaders would meet him in the days to come. “I don’t have anything to say against BJP. It has become a technology-savvy party,” Tiwari said. “There are some ‘tatkal’ leaders and they have slapped allegations on me for going beyond the party’s protocol by giving statements in media. But they have actually leaked the news of our show-cause notice to media even before it reached me,” he added.Bengal BJP spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya said: “If the party has sent a show-cause notice to someone, he will respond. I don’t think there is anyone disgruntled in BJP.” Thakur, meanwhile, organized a picnic at Gobordanga in North 24 Parganas, attended by many party workers though no heavyweight leader was seen. Last Sunday, Thakur had arranged a picnic in Bongaon that was attended by BJP leaders such as Sayantan Basu, Tiwari and Majumdar, apart from three North 24 Parganas MLAs. Thakur said: “Let them do whatever they want to. There will be many more who will be meeting me in the days to come. If workers across Bengal want to meet me, will they be expelled from the party?”BJP did not react to Thakur’s picnics. “Winter is always a preferred time to arrange picnics. Anyone can arrange one. If they invite us, we will also attend. A picnic can never be a party programme. We don’t have any objection to that. We are talking to dissenting leaders and you will see the results soon,” Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/thakurs-meet-bjp-duo-showcaused-for-attendance/articleshow/89081694.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Car mows down pedestrian, injures biker in Salt Lake; woman arrested||KOLKATA: A car, with a 29-year-old woman behind the wheels, mowed down a 60-year-old pedestrian and hit a delivery agent of an e-commerce portal on two-wheelers before it mounted on the footpath and then crashed into a lamp post and the iron gate of house at a sparsely crowded lane in Salt Lake’s SA Block around 1.15pm on Sunday. The pedestrian died on the spot. The accused, Varsha Dugar, a resident of AH Block in Salt Lake and employee of a private firm, was arrested by Bidhannagar East police. The damaged two-wheeler of Arijit MondalThe deceased, Geeta Shaw, who worked as a domestic help at multiple households in Salt Lake, was walking towards her home in Keshtopur when the accident happened. The delivery agent, Arijit Mondal, who was undergoing treatment at a private hospital, sustained severe leg injuries and might have to lose some of his toes. Dugar claimed before the cops that she had a momentary brain-fade and lost her control over the vehicle. Cops have booked her under multiple IPC sections including 279 (rash driving) and 304A (causing death due to negligence) among others, said an officer of Bidhannagar East police station. Cops said the woman had a valid driving license that was issued in 2019 but she was not a regular driver. According to the police, the car (Ford Ecosport), which the woman was driving, was registered under the name of her father, Shanti Lal Dugar. The accident happened when she was heading towards Baisakhi from the Tank number 7 crossing on the Kestopur Canal Side Road. “She first hit the two-wheeler of the delivery agent, a Duttabad resident, who had stopped on the left side of the road to check the map on his mobile. She then swerved right and hit the woman before crashing into the lamp post and the iron gate of a house. The woman was flung up in the air under the impact of the accident,” said an SA block resident, who saw the accident from his balcony. Another witness said that the eyeballs of the deceased got dislodged and landed onto the road after the accident. Cops soon reached the spot and shifted the woman and the delivery agent to separate hospitals. The woman was declared dead on arrival. “The impact of the accident shows that the car was being driven at a high speed. The accident left the cemented base of the lamp post damaged. The car was also badly damaged,” said an officer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/car-mows-down-pedestrian-injures-biker-in-salt-lake-woman-arrested/articleshow/89081696.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Kolkata||‘Jadavpur accused had more alcohol than permissible limit’||Kolkata: Rahul Banerjee (33), who was behind the wheels of the car that hit a bike and rammed into roadside stalls, killing Samir Thomas Karmakar (52), a hotel manager and a resident of Chittaranjan Colony, and injuring six others near Sulekha crossing at Jadavpur on Saturday night, was on the way to drop a couple after an alcohol party at his Lake Gardens residence. Banerjee had quit his job at a mobile manufacturing giant in Bengaluru to join a startup launched by his friends in Kolkata. The youth, on whom a breathalyzer test was conducted, had consumed 65mg/100 ml of alcohol, (the permitted limit is 30mg/100 ml). “Banerjee claimed that his grandmother had been ill and he had come down to Kolkata from Bengaluru to look after her. He was going to the house of his friend in Sulekha when the accident occurred. He was scheduled to return to Bengaluru next week,” said a police officer. “We have slapped IPC sections 304 (II) and 308 and also charged him under section 185 of Motor Vehicles Act for drinking under the influence of alcohol. We are drawing up separate sections against them for violating night restrictions,” said DC (Traffic-South) Atul V. The accused was produced in court and sent to police custody till January 29. Cops said Karmakar was flung under the impact of the accident and then he landed on the windscreen of the car. He died on the spot. Of the injured, Bankim Pal Banik was stated to be critical with severe head injuries at SSKM Hospital while his niece Sohini was stable. The two were on a bike that was hit by the car first. Krishna Gopal Ghosh (55) was also critical with head injuries at Iris Hospital. Shop owner Swapan Roy and his wife Padma were discharged from Baghajatin Hospital. Their customer Anik Pal (24) was admitted to AMRI Hospital with leg injuries.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/jadavpur-accused-had-more-alcohol-than-permissible-limit/articleshow/89081697.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The accident happened barely an hour after another accident near Sulekha crossing at Jadavpur. “The car with a Jharkhand number plate and a government of India sticker was used by the central GST department. The driver of the car resorted to rash driving and rammed into the guard rail, put up for naka check, at a high speed. Though there was no casualty, the accident left several stalls damaged,” said an officer.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: 6,000 cyber complaints last year, Rs 6.3 crore recovered||KOLKATA: From university professors to traders and app-cab drivers, everyone has been susceptible to cyber crime. Last year alone, cops have recorded over 6,000 fraud or attempted fraud cases with cyber sleuths managing to stop as much as Rs 6.3 crore from reaching the fraudsters. On certain days, police are now receiving 30-35 such complaints, said sources. According to NRCB, cyber frauds in Kolkata saw a five-time increase from the pre-pandemic 2018 to the pandemic-hit 2020. The figures are likely to see a sharp spurt in 2021, sources said. Recently, several university professors ended up losing Rs 20.5 lakh. A trader in Ballygunge lost Rs 23 lakh by investing in a fake cryptocurrency scheme. What shocked cops, though, was the ease with which an app-cab driver in the Port area ended up losing Rs 40,000. Similarly, a vendor risking his life savings and investing in cryptocurrency ended up losing a few lakhs. “We have been told that the modus operandi is what we are fighting. Hence, the amount does not carry much significance,” said a senior Port department officer. Cops said, with the pandemic bridging the digital divide as cross-sections of the society became dependent on smartphones to cope with the global challenge, it has made the lower middle-class and poorer sections of the society equally susceptible to cyber crimes, like those who were traditionally more vulnerable — people engaged in high-paying jobs, businesses, and professions. This has led the city police to launch a massive campaign — which is no longer limited to the digital space — to spread awareness on multiple cyber frauds that now have victims who are geographically more spread out in the city. “The campaign against cyber crime will now cover major crossings, markets and other public spots. We have prepared leaflets and posters in Bengali, English and Hindi, and distributed them at places where the population is the most vulnerable. We are also making public safety announcements to make people aware of the recent methods of fraud. It is clear fraudsters are shifting their operational base to the city and increasingly using local languages to win the trust of the poorer section. When cheated, their amounts might be low, but they will be equally hurt, if not more,” said an officer from the anti-bank fraud section. In Burrabazar and New Market, police have asked private bank officials to join them to spread awareness on cyber fraud among residents. In attendance were several traders and senior citizens — considered the most prone to cyber crime attacks. The residents were also told of non-banking frauds and methods to keep safe while ordering online or in a work-from-home experience. In the Port area, the cops were more blunt — keeping the session limited to do’s and don’ts. “We are tweaking our awareness campaigns based on requirements and cyber-crime patterns from specific areas,” said an officer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/6k-cyber-plaints-last-yr-6-3cr-recovered/articleshow/89081699.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Business||All charged up and out in front of the pack||Chennai: If India’s electric vehicle story is supercharged right now, Tarun Mehta and Swapnil Jain are among the boosters. Their nearly-decade-old baby, Ather Energy, which makes the 450 X and 450 Plus e-scooters, has made headlines with its fund-raises for the past couple of years. The latest came 10 days ago when existing investor Hero Motocorp pumped in Rs 420 crore, the fifth infusion in as many years, taking its total funding to more than Rs 950 crore. Hero is by no means the only investor – the list includes Tiger Global Management, Flipkart founders Sachin and Binny Bansal, and InnoVen Capital. But the real story of Ather Energy is how Mehta and Jain dreamt an impossible dream as students of IIT-Madras and how they returned to their alma mater to make that dream come true. Says Jain: "Tarun and I met while studying engineering design at IIT Madras, where we worked on several research projects together. After graduating, we took up jobs but resigned later to work on battery packs, which we discovered were among the most significant shortcomings in electric vehicles in India." Eventually, the duo went on to design an electric vehicle from the ground up. "OEMs were only building or importing basic vehicles and this sparked the idea of developing an EV that is a viable alternative to petrol counterparts," says Jain. Mehta and Jain decided to go back to IIT-Madras for inspiration and help. "We reached out to our professor R Krishnakumar in late 2012 and he assured us all possible support and urged us to come back to IIT-M as project associates," recalls Mehta. That back-to-school decision was a game changer for the duo. "We took up project associate work and it was like coming back as students – staying in hostels, working out of labs. Just 6-7 months later, we had built a prototype of both a scooter and a battery pack," he adds. Ather Energy was formally incubated at the IIT-M Research Park in 2013. In 2014, Mehta and Jain received `45 lakh as funding from the technology development board under the department of science and technology, IIT Madras, and Srini V Srinivasan, an IIT alumnus and founder of Aerospike. The initial years were tough. "One of the investors we approached asked us to retrofit electric motors into an Activa and start selling them," says Mehta. "He also agreed to give us money to buy 50 used Activas to see how it works. …Suggestions kept pouring in: don’t make a product, don’t build technology, there’s no market for such a product in India." Today, Ather’s factory in Hosur cranks out 120,000 scooters a year and employs 400 people. The company has commissioned a second factory in Hosur and is investing `650 crore over five years. The target: to ramp up production to 400,000 units per annum. Apart from the EVs, the facility will also make lithium-ion batteries. Already Ather Energy is among the top four EV brands by volume and became the "largest EV two-wheeler company by revenue in October 2021 with a revenue rate of $100 million," says Mehta. As for funding, the company has raised more than $158 million till date (more than `1,100 crore) and "will be raising funds as part of our Series E round shortly," says Jain.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/all-charged-up-and-out-in-front-of-the-pack/articleshow/89080356.cms||Nandini Sen Gupta
---||Business||Bittersweet, but green shoots||Chennai: After hitting a peak in 2011 in terms of production and capacity use, the sugar industry in Tamil Nadu has been down since 2016. The area under sugarcane fell with water scarcity and 15 of the 43 sugar mills in the state downed shutters. The bountiful rain in 2021 has seen green shoots sprouting, but a turnaround is at least a couple of ‘cutting’ seasons away. A hand from the government would help, say mill owners. "This is an industry that caters to five lakh farmers, provides direct and indirect employment to two lakh and generates around `4,500 crore in revenue. It has been suffering since 2016 due to drought and monsoon failures," says Palani G Periasamy, executive chairman, Dharani Sugars and Chemicals, and vice- president, Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA). From a peak of 254.65 lakh tonnes of cane crushed and a capacity utilisation of 99% in 2011-12, the sugar industry in Tamil Nadu hit a low of 81.4 lakh tonnes crushing and 31% utilisation in 2016-17. Sugar production fell from 23.8 lakh tonnes to seven lakh tonnes during the period, while sugar recovery came down from 9.4% to 8.6%. In 2020-21, the industry crushed 98.3 lakh tonnes of cane, produced 8.8 lakh tonnes of sugar at a recovery rate of 8.9% and a capacity utilisation of 38%. Capacity utilization has remained below 40% over the past four seasons. Unlike in other states, mills in Tamil Nadu have a unique problem. The Centre fixes the fair and remunerative price (FRP) per tonne at 9.5% recovery and including the farmers’ transport cost in bringing cane to the mills. But Tamil Nadu millers have to pay transport cost over and above FRP and the sugar they recover from a tonne of cane is also less. "Fortunately for us, the new DMK government has ordered payment of `150 per tonne to cane farmers for 2020-21, in addition to `42.5 per tonne as transitional production incentive. This move will make it attractive for farmers to return to sugarcane cultivation, thereby leading to higher capacity utilisation for the mills," says Periasamy. "When compared to Uttar Pradesh, where recovery is at 11%,, farmers here earn `400 less and spend `500 more per tonne. This has pushed many sugar mills into financial trouble. It is a lose-lose situation for both sides [farmers and millers] here," says N Ramanathan, managing director, Ponni Sugars. Industry mulls over two options. A newer variety of sugarcane to up yield, for which cultivation trials are still on. And, mechanisation of harvesting to cut costs. "Labour cost is high. Mechanised harvesting is the way forward and the state government could incentivize MSMEs in the Coimbatore region, known for their re-engineering skills, to develop new cutting tools for sugarcane," says Ramanathan. Of course, the industry has other sources of revenue such as co-generation of power and production of ethanol. But there are problems there too. Co-generation of power, by burning bagasse, took off in Tamil Nadu in the late 1990s and did well for about 15 years. Of late, Tangedco has not renewed the PPA (power purchase agreement) at cost-plus-margin basis as recommended by TNERC (Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulation Commission). Payments are also delayed to mills with valid PPA and those willing to supply power at a lower cost. "The total payouts to sugar mills in a year for co-generation is around `180 crore to `200 crore or about `15 crore per month. Given the size of Tangedco’s dealings, despite its financial woes, timely payment to this agro-industry may not pinch it much," say sugar industry sources.  "You cannot tie both our hands and ask us to survive. The state could get Tangedco to make regular monthly payments into escrow accounts with a condition that the money should be used only for paying cane arrears to farmers. Or else permit us to opt for third-party sale without the cross subsidy and surcharges," says Ramanathan. The other option, ethanol, has limited scope as Tamil Nadu is a molasses deficit state due to lower capacity utilization of sugar mills. However, the copious rain has raised hopes.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/bittersweet-but-green-shoots/articleshow/89080364.cms||D Govardan
---||Business||The sweet taste of success: TN’s bean-to-bar chocolate brands||Chennai: Actress Kalki Koechlin is a diehard fan of Auroville-based organic chocolate brand Mason & Co. Mozart of Madras A R Rahman invited Puducherry-based chocolate brand Zuka to set up shop at his KM music conservatory. Tourists thronging Kodaikanal look for Caesar’s brand of home-made chocolates. Ooty old-timers swear by King Star. Tamil Nadu is fast becoming a hub for bean-to-bar chocolate brands. These brands and others such as Kocoatrait are offering fresh flavours, single origin, organic cocoa, eco-friendly packaging (no plastic) and artisanal production to new-age customers who want more than cookie-cutter brands. With the lockdown forcing people to look for both fresh and sustainable food brands, TN’s bean-to-bar brigade has seen a significant increase in demand. Nitin Chordia, founder of Kocoatrait, a bean-to-bar startup, says online sales tripled during the pandemic. "We have recruited new customers without spending a penny on paid advertising." India’s `15-crore artisanal bean-to-bar chocolate market has been growing steadily for the past 4-5 years. Mansi Reddy, director (marketing), Mason & CO, says, "We are the pioneers of the bean-to-bar movement in India and have been making Indian-origin chocolate for eight years now. When we started we were the only company in this space, now there are more than 15." "Currently, India is one the fastest growing markets for chocolates, be it in the industrial or artisanal sector," says Srinath Balachandran, MD, Zuka. Part of the reason why this segment is attracting the new-age customer is its vocal-for-local, sustainable positioning. "We make organic, dark chocolate using Indian-origin beans sourced directly from farmers and co-ops in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka," says Mason & Co’s Reddy. For Kocoatrait, vegan fruit and nut bars and offbeat flavours such as jasmine, jaggery, red rose, mor milagai and masala chai have worked well. As for Zuka, Balachandran and his team have been working on dairy-free chocolate. "A lot of dark chocolates are made with milk fat and many chocolate companies use the same machinery to process milk and dark chocolate," says Balachandran. "We are working to create chocolate free of any trace of dairy products, making it suitable for vegans," he says. Artisanal chocolate brands depend on word-of-mouth and social media. Arun Vijaay Malli, who runs Ten Degrees restaurant in Kodaikanal, swears by local chocolate brand Caesar’s. "They are so good that I retail them not only in my restaurant but also in my gourmet store Cheese Corner in Madurai," he says. Tourists come looking for home-made artisanal brands and Caesar’s now has a cult status, he adds.  King Star has been in business in Ooty for 80 years. Third-generation chocolateur J Vivek ,who runs the Jai’s King Star chocolate shop on Ooty’s Commercial Street, says, "The chocolate shop was started in 1942 by my grandfather J Thambusamy, who worked at M/s Carter confectionery in the late 1930s. It is an age-old British formula and the tools used are made in England."King Star brand offers more than 40 varieties of chocolates and is a favourite with locals as well as tourists. Mason & Co has its own outlets, Bread & Chocolate, in Alwarpet, on OMR and in Auroville and Pondicherry.

---||Delhi||End of road: Transport dept turns off ignition for over 2 lakh old diesel vehicles in Delhi in January||NEW DELHI: The transport department de-registered around two lakh diesel-run cars in Delhi that were more than 10-years-old from its database this month. The department is also impounding diesel vehicles that are more than 15 years old and sending these to be scrapped. “Diesel vehicles that are more than 10 years old can’t ply on Delhi’s roads and as per the guidelines for scrapping of motor vehicles notified by the department, they can’t even be parked in a public street,” a Delhi government official said, adding that the transport department has been issuing a series of public notices since last year to draw the attention of people to the legal position of the pliability of these vehicles. According to sources in the transport department, 365 “end-of-life” vehicles have been impounded till January 17, and close to 3,000 ‘overaged’ vehicles were impounded last year. “We intensified the drive against overage diesel vehicles since October last year when more than 300 such vehicles were impounded. We seized more than 850 old vehicles in November 2020, and nearly 1,400 vehicles in December last year,” the officials said. “We had planned to intensify the drive further, but due to the sudden rise in Covid-19 cases, the enforcement drive has lost some pace,” he said. “The vehicles that have been de-registered are not just impounded but immediately sent to scrappers authorised by Delhi government,” he said. The government, however, has provided the option of converting such vehicles into electric ones. It is trying to empanel more manufacturers of pure electric kits by approved testing agencies. After retrofitting, more than 10-year-old diesel-run vehicles can be used longer as an electric vehicle. The department also provides no-objection certificates (NOC) to vehicles over 10 years old and have been de-registered to be again registered in other states where older cars are allowed to ply. According to sources, around 1 lakh diesel-run vehicles have been de-registered in Delhi over the last couple of years and the remaining number was 1.1 lakh diesel-run vehicles older than 10 years. There are also around 87,000 diesel-run vehicles that are almost 15 years old or even older and would have to be mandatorily scrapped. The Supreme Court had prohibited the plying of 15-year-old petrol and 10-year-old diesel vehicles in the national capital on October 29, 2018. A 2014 order of the National Green Tribunal does not permit vehicles older than 15 years to be parked in any public area. According to officials, the total number of overaged vehicles in Delhi is close to 40 lakhs, including around 38 petrol-run cars that are more than 15 years old. The department, however, is taking action against old diesel-run vehicles first. Vehicle owners who want to get old vehicles scrapped can apply online or call an authorised scrapper, who pays the scrap value agreed upon and picks up the car from the owner’s residence.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/end-of-road-transport-dept-turns-off-ignition-for-over-2-lakh-old-diesel-vehicles-in-january/articleshow/89080706.cms||Sidharatha Roy

The bank added that Bijapurkar has been penalised Rs 2 lakh. In its letter to the exchange with the subject ‘inadvertent trade by designated person’, the bank said that her independent financial adviser purchased 4,900 equity shares of the ICICI Bank in her account without prior intimation to her when the trading window was closed. “The audit committee of the bank was notified of this incident. Based on Bijapurkar’s submission, it is concluded that this was an inadvertent trade made without any intent to violate the bank’s code prohibiting insider trading or Sebi rules. However, as there was an infraction of the bank’s code and the SEBI Regulations, a penalty of Rs 2 lakh has been imposed upon confirmation by the Audit Committee at its meeting held on January 22, 2022 and the said amount shall be remitted to Investor Protection Education Fund (IPEF) in accordance with the Sebi regulations,” the bank said. Bijapurkar had submitted her resignation to the bank chairman on Friday stating that her consulting and teaching role, which involed engagement with other financial institutions, were seen to be in conflict with her directorship. On Saturday, ICICI Bank also declared its highest every quarterly profit of Rs 6,194 crore — an increase of 25% over the year-ago period.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/icici-director-who-quit-last-wk-fined-for-insider-trade/articleshow/89080780.cms||---

With the US markets enjoying one of their best years in 2021 (S&P 500 gained over 27% in 2021), investments by Indians in US stock markets more than doubled with Indians investing to the tune of $300-500 million across top wealth management platforms. From wishing to diversify geographically to hedge against a depreciating rupee and saving up for aspirations such as foreign education or travel, Indians have put their money on stocks like Tesla and the popular FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google) in the year. Emergence of tech startups that simplify the logistics involved in global investing has also helped. These startups provide more information and research on global markets, facilitate quick account openings, and seamless and less expensive remittances thus encouraging Indians to explore international markets. Data from global investing platform Stockal shows Indian investment into the US grew more than 200% in 2021 over 2020. “While transacting investors grew more than almost 250%, volumes doubled and grew from $250 million in 2020 to close to $500 million in 2021 on Stockal among Indians,” Sitashwa Srivastava, co-founder, Stockal, said. Majority of these investors show a great deal of maturity, he adds, citing that, on Stockal, about 70% of the users trade once or twice in six months, and park funds in curated portfolios managed by global asset managers.Vested Finance, a US SEC-registered online investment platform, saw close to 800,000 new signups on its platform with investors placing more than 450,000 trades throughout the year with trading volumes crossing $250 million. “In 2021, Indians invested double of their 2020 investments (in US stocks),” Viram Shah, co-founder and CEO, Vested Finance, said. Shah added that the users are typically investing for the long term to build their wealth via global companies. On Kristal.AI’s digital-first private wealth platform, more than 1,600 new accounts were opened in 2021 — almost 10X of what they saw in 2020. Asheesh Chanda, co-founder and CEO, Kristal.AI, estimates that there has been over 50% growth in the industry (global investing) overall. Among others, the key drivers include access to high alpha investment options like pre-IPOs and alternative funds, he adds. Currently, even as US stock markets go through a correction phase, Stockal’s Srivastava says though some people are booking profits, many Indians are making fresh investments because stocks are cheaper and the dollar has also weakened.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indians-placed-record-bets-on-us-stocks-in-21/articleshow/89080301.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

Will there be an encore given that rural markets have slowed down and high inflation continues to bite? In an exclusive interview with TOI, Mehta speaks about how HUL is navigating the choppy external environment, while also developing in-house new age business endeavours. His Budget wish: An MGNREGA equivalent for the urban poor. Excerpts: Unilever is planning to recast its structure. What does this mean for HUL?Organisations keep evolving with the changing times, like organisms. The consumer trends are changing, the channels are reshaping and the competitive context is changing. In this respect, the premise around which Unilever is working on the new structures is — how do you make the company much more agile than what it is today, enhance category focus, and strengthen accountability. Last year, you had said that you want volume-led growth with healthy margins. Should HUL be more discreet in taking grammage reductions in small packs?When things are normal, when there are placid waters, you look at volume growth very closely. Around 65-70% of our topline growth consists of volume growth. That’s the reason we have always talked about volume-led profitable growth. But when there is hyperinflation, you can’t stick to the same metric. There are two important imperatives — to ensure consumers remain with you and to protect your business model. We play the portfolio as we have brands and pack sizes at different price points, offering varied benefits. Our intent is that even if a consumer chooses to change a brand it should remain within Unilever’s portfolio of brands. When it comes to price increases the first port of call is looking at all lines of P&L (profit & loss), optimise the costs and only then in a calibrated manner we look at price increases. We also look at the strength of our brands to carry price increase and also endeavour to protect the packs with low price points. It’s not an easy game but at HUL, we always play the game for the long term. We would never do things at the cost of the long-term health of our business. Inflation and Covid would have been especially harsh on smaller and local players in FMCG. Has that share of the market shifted to HUL?There has been more formalisation of the economy. With challenges like the pandemic and the high inflation, the companies that survive and thrive are those that are much more agile, and adapt faster to the changing circumstances. It’s not come to our attention that some players who were big in certain pockets, have closed shop. There are numerous players operating in every district. They would, of course, be stressed. But our performance is not just good compared to the average of the market. Our share gains have been extremely good and in most categories they are top of the league and even when compared to our big competitors. How are you competing with the D2C startups?The headroom to grow in India is massive. It is not a zero-sum game. We see these as opportunities and that’s the reason we set up our own premium business unit whose whole mandate is digital-first brands. We have put in our best entrepreneurial people to focus on it and start growing. For us, digital is something that is going to impact the whole value chain. And it is for this reason why we started the ‘Reimagine HUL’ agenda 5-6 years back. Over 15% of our demand is now captured digitally, which is indicative of the focus that we have brought in. We have seen great success and 15% of our Rs 50,000-crore business is a pretty substantive business compared to any other digital-first brand. Channel reshaping or e-commerce is not going to go away. We are extremely cognizant of that. That was the reason why we started building our muscle in this arena. I don’t mind if we are not the first to a trend every time. It’s okay to be a second or a third to a trend but we could still be better and win in the long run. How is your premium beauty business doing?They are doing reasonably well and are meeting the yardstick that we had set for the first year. The intention was to create a unit with an entrepreneurial mindset, bring in the right talent and let them blossom amid a large company. They get all the resources they want and they even have a different remuneration system. If it works, we will be able to extend it to other parts of the businesses as well. They are going to be pioneers in many different ways. What are your Budget expectations?The government could look at extending the outlay on MGNREGA till the economy fully recovers and the rural markets and the rural consumption goes back to its normal beat. However, in the last two years since the pandemic, very little has been done for the urban poor. During the pandemic, restaurants, hotels and tourism have been impacted in a big way. We have been talking to the government that we need to look at a MGNREGA equivalent for the urban poor. The same can be customised to the urban needs. According to a Sebi requirement, the CMD post will have to be split. What’s the status of that? According to Sebi’s directive, we have to implement it before April 1, and HUL will always comply with the law of the land.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/need-mgnrega-like-scheme-for-urban-poor-hul-chief/articleshow/89080842.cms||Namrata Singh

However, the deadweight of these old accounts continues to be on their books as the National Asset Reconstruction Company (NARC) or ‘bad bank’ announced in last year’s Budget is yet to take off and some proposed reforms for private asset reconstruction companies (ARCs) are still pending. New buyers for bad loans are also needed as the recovery rate is slipping and more bad loans may turn up in future. The recovery rate from bad loans, which jumped from 26% pre-bankruptcy code to around 39% as of FY21, is again slipping thanks to delays in bad loan resolution. Besides, reducing the upfront cash requirement from 15% to 2.5%, an RBI panel had proposed major reforms for ARCs. They include allowing ARCs to submit resolution plans for bankrupt companies. “The next wave of NPAs will emanate from stressed MSME and retail sectors after the available restructuring windows close. For transfer of these small-ticket loans to ARCs, there is an urgent need to broad base investor base with inclusion of high net-worth individuals, corporates, family offices, trusts to subscribe to ARC security receipts, as recommended by the RBI appointed committee recently,” said Hari Hara Mishra, director, UV ARC. According to Edelweiss ARC MD R K Bansal, there is a need to discontinue the minimum alternate tax (section 115JB) that is currently levied on a company whose application under the provisions of IBC has been admitted by NCLT, till the time that the company’s prospects turnaround considering the resolution plan submitted to the NCLT. “This would benefit in carrying forward the entire brought forward book losses and unabsorbed depreciation for set off in future years, thereby making the acquisition of distressed companies more lucrative,” said Bansal. Buyers of insolvent companies face tax demands if the price they pay is less than the fair market value or the listed price. As speculators can ramp up prices of even insolvent companies with zero net worth, the market price is not reflective of underlying value. “The authorities must also focus on additional challenges that affect the majority of corporate insolvency resolution processes (CIRPs) such as being cash-starved leading to inordinate delays. There is also a lack of clarity on the position of the interim financier as to what information the financier is privy to and clear-cut guidelines for institutions lending in this space. In addition, a framework for fast-track disposal of litigations for timely completion of the CIRP process is also the need of the hour,” said Kundan Shahi, founder and CEO, LegalPay. Another hindrance for an ARC in resolution is the 1% tax deduction at source (TDS) on sale of immovable property under Section 194-IA. “The ARC exercises its rights under the Sarfaesi Act as a secured lender and only appropriates the proceeds to the extent of its dues. Any excess amount realized over and above the dues is returned to the borrower. Therefore, TDS on sale of property under Sarfaesi may be kept out of the purview of Section 194-IA,” said Bansal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/psu-bad-bank-reforms-for-asset-rejig-cos-hang-fire/articleshow/89080803.cms||Mayur Shetty

In the third wave, too, RWAs are playing a crucial part. But their role has undergone a change during the current wave, which is partly due to the nature of the virus this time around that is spreading very fast but has kept hospitalisation and requirement of oxygen low till now. While during the first two waves, members of RWAs were burdened with requests for hospitalisation and oxygen cylinders, such SOS calls have been minimum during the ongoing third wave.  “The cases have spread rapidly, and a big number of people have tested positive in high-rises and gated communities. But the number of emergency cases are much lower compared to the first and second waves. The second wave, in particular, was very scary where every second person required oxygen or hospitalisation,” said Samaresh Das of New Town Forum and News, an umbrella body of associations in New Town. Members of RWAs have found themselves encountering a peculiar problem this time. “Many people who have symptoms are roaming freely. They are neither testing nor isolating themselves. Since they are using common utilities, like elevators, with other residents, the virus is spreading. Several new cases are being reported from various households daily. We are trying to locate such people and requesting them to get tested and isolate themselves,” said the secretary of an RWA near Ruby crossing on EM Bypass. Several housing complexes have been distributing self-testing kits among the residents with symptoms. “We had to distribute kits because laboratories could not spare agents due to the high demand and several members in many homes were down with fever and cold,” said Sourabh Ghosh, secretary of a housing complex in Sreebhumi. Several gated communities set up volunteer groups to assist citizens in distress. “Unlike last time, when we had to rush several people to the hospital, this time we are shopping for groceries and medicines. Several senior citizens stay alone and do not have anybody to do chores for them,” said Ankit Agarwal, a resident of Shukhobrishti in New Town.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/changing-rwa-role-gives-insight-into-changing-virus/articleshow/89081700.cms||Zeeshan Javed

While some flew back to their host destinations after waiting for hours for the weather to improve, multiple airlines made Ranchi-bound passengers get off at Kolkata and forced them to take a refund instead of making arrangements to take them onward. This led to multiple demonstrations from agitated passengers at Kolkata airport.Visibility was low at Kolkata airport between 6.30am and 8.30am, but that didn’t hamper flight movement to and from the city, airport officials said.Vistara’s Ranchi-bound flight from Delhi was the first to land in Kolkata with 76 passengers at 8.45am. It was followed by Go First’s Delhi–Ranchi–Kolkata flight with 115 passengers, which came straight to Kolkata around 9am with 32-odd passengers scheduled to get off at Ranchi. They were refunded money and left clueless about their onward journey. IndiGo’s flight from Hyderabad was diverted to Kolkata with 83 passengers at 11.30pm and remained stationed at a parking bay. After waiting for around one-and-a-half hours, the flight departed to Ranchi making use of a small window when the weather had marginally improved. Vistara’s Delhi–Ranchi flight also flew to Ranchi during the same period. Two AirAsia flights from Bengaluru and Delhi carrying 116 and 67 passengers respectively also got stranded here. The situation spiraled out of control with 62-odd passengers from Bhubaneswar on an Air India flight being asked to take a refund and being left with no means to fly to Ranchi on Sunday. This led to a demonstration with passengers taking to social media and an open demonstration inside the airport.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/diversion-of-flights-after-bad-weather-protest-at-city-airport/articleshow/89081702.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

The number of active Covid cases which had gone over 9,000 in the second week of January have come down, hovering around 6,000 at present. After crossing the 1,000 daily Covid cases mark on January 10 when 1,312 fresh cases were reported, the daily numbers continued to be over 1,000 for the next few days after which there has been a gradual decline in the number of daily cases. An average of about 300 to 350 daily fresh cases are now getting reported in the last few days. However, there has been an increase in the number of Covid deaths in BMC area with 12 deaths reported this month so far. A total of 372 Covid deaths have been reported and over 56,500 persons have been affected by Covid in BMC area since the pandemic broke out in March 2020. BMC authorities have been conducting regular sanitising drives with police too conducting drives in the market places to check whether people are wearing masks.Neighbouring South Dum Dum municipality which has been keeping all markets and commercial establishments in its area closed thrice a week till now has decided to keep markets closed for two days from this week on Tuesdays and Saturdays. It will hold another review to consider withdrawing the market closures from February.About 40 to 50 daily new Covid cases are being reported in South Dum Dum, with 17 micro-C zones in Bangur, Golaghata and areas off Jessore Road. In North 24 Parganas, over 1,000 fresh Covid cases are getting reported daily.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/relief-for-bmc-but-spike-continues-in-n-24-parganas/articleshow/89081704.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Covid cases yet to fall in Beliaghata containment zones||KOLKATA: At least three containment zones in the Beliaghata-Phoolbagan area continue to bother the Kolkata Municipal Corporation and Kolkata Police. While the focus on micro-containment still firmly remains in pockets of south Kolkata covering Karaya, Ballygunge, New Alipore and Netaji Nagar, the pockets in the eastern suburbs of the city, lying in wards 31 and 33, have stubbornly remained in the city’s micro-containment zone for the longest time. One address here, a complex, has been in the list since the beginning from early January. “The three areas - Canal Circular Road, Beliaghata Main Road and Suren Sarkar Road - had seen various blocks entering the containment zones even in the past two waves. The difference this time is that fresh cases are continuing to be reported from all these zones. The micro-containment list was last updated on Thursday evening. Fresh cases had been reported even on December 15 and 16 from these areas. However, on the positive side, fresh cases are declining and it may not be long before these addresses manage to walk out of the containment zone list,” said a KMC health department officer. Anindya Routh, borough III chairman, on Sunday conceded that the high-rises and the housing complexes were still a worrying factor for the Covid-combat team. “Some high-rises are still recording fresh cases, making the state health department act tough so that the infection doesn’t spread,” Routh said. However, the KMC borough chairman expressed hope that the containment tag from these areas would be removed soon. According to a KMC health department official assigned to look after the Beliaghata-Kankurgachhi belt, the infection rate has remained stable in several high-rises or housing complexes due to an apathy towards testing among a section of residents. “If we can bring residents of high-rises with even mild symptoms under a voluntary testing scheme, the infection rate will go down,” the civic official said. While KMC health officials have pointed to its proximity to Salt Lake as a reason behind the proliferation of cases, the fact remains that this area, a mix of slums and flats, has multiple access points. The residents from different strata of society have often refused to abide by the containment rules, the police said “Despite signs being put up, this being a well-connected area, witnessed a lot of movement, even that of outsiders,” said an officer from eastern suburban division. He cited the example of Suren Sarkar Road which has as many as 16 addresses under containment. “While houses under containment are changing, the huge influx of people in this large area is preventing the area from leaving the micro-containment list,” he added. Police say they were not looking at “one pill solution” to the rising Covid cases. “Now that Covid has reached the apartments, we are choosing the highest affected zones by rotation one by one instead of shutting down the entire area and concentrating on controlling the disease,” said an officer at Lalbazar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/cases-yet-to-fall-in-beliaghata-c-zones/articleshow/89081706.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||Kolkata gets long spell of drizzles, temperature fluctuation triggers viral infections||KOLKATA: A temperature fluctuation over the last 2-3 days has again triggered a spate of viral infections with symptoms that are similar to Covid. From 13.8 degrees Celsius on January 21, the minimum temperature shot up 17.4 degrees on Saturday, only to climb down to 16.8 on Sunday. A cloud cover, unseasonal drizzles and a cool winter breeze have turned many prone to infection which may or may not be Covid, say doctors. Late on Sunday evening, Kolkata received a long spell of drizzle which intensified into moderate rain after 9.30 pm. The Met office said the city may receive more such spells on Monday. But the symptoms are overlapping, leading them to recommend a Covid test which most patients are reluctant to do. Adeno virus, rhinovirus, influenza virus and non-novel coronaviruses are on the prowl in Kolkata, warned experts. They strike routinely at this time of the year when temperature fluctuates in winter, they added. “They trigger a bout of cough and cold, body ache, occasionally fever. Headache has been a common symptom this time and it has been striking both Covid positives and negatives. While we are prescribing tests, most prefer to take medicines and stay at home and are skipping the test since symptoms are mild and recovery has been quick. But a section of patients has been suffering from a lingering weakness which probably indicates Omicron,” said Sabyasachi Bardhan, a general physician. Even as the number of Covid patients started leaping earlier this month, thousands were infected with a dry cough, which has worsened leading to body ache and fever, said Belle Vue Clinic internal medicine consultant Rahul Jain. “Number of Covid cases has now started sliding and most have been mild so far. The virus has struck and gone even before many could get tested. But it’s better to get an RTPCR done or else the infected may unknowingly spread the virus which is now happening,” said Jain. Those with symptoms, even if they are very mild, should get tested immediately, said Peerless Hospital microbiologist Bhaskar Narayan Chowdhury. “Or else, they will spread the virus. A large number is getting infected by non-Covid viruses, too. But unfortunately, we have an even larger number of asymptomatic positives who have led to this massive spread. Omicron has been mild the world over and this can’t be helped,” said Chowdhury. Meanwhile, a low-pressure trough across Bihar and Odisha triggered clouds and the drizzles in Kolkata and south Bengal. Sunderbans received thunderstorms. The weather could remain unchanged till Wednesday, though the rains may stop from the second half of Tuesday, said the RMC. “A low cloud cover hung over Kolkata on Sunday even as moisture flowed in from the sea. Visibility was poor and the clouds will persist till Tuesday. The temperature, too, will remain unchanged till January 26 after which the mercury will drop. It may slid down to 12-13 degrees by January 27-28,” said RMC director GK Das.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/kol-gets-long-spell-of-drizzles-temp-fluctuation-triggers-viral-infections/articleshow/89081707.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Tight security, Covid-safety arrangements in place as lakes and parks reopen today||KOLATA: With both Rabindra and Subhas Sarobar — maintained by Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA) — to reopen from Monday for three hours in the morning and all the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) parks to reopen both in morning and evening shifts, the authorities will follow the same arrangements as was done when lakes and parks had reopened during the second wave. Six out of the 12 gates of Rabindra Sarobar will open from Monday, so that each gate has adequate security guards. “The guidelines will remain the same. They should be vaccinated and security guards will be there to check the vaccination status as was done during the second wave. The morning walkers are all very responsible citizens and they very much cooperate with us in matters of maintaining the Covid safety protocols,” said a KMDA official. The authorities put up notices on the Sarobar gates on Sunday, announcing the reopening from Monday 6am to 9am. Lake regulars said that they will be following the Covid safety protocols like wearing masks and maintaining social distancing. “I am thankful to the government for reopening Rabindra Sarobar for morning walkers. The government has our full cooperation in following Covid precautionary measures inside the premises,” said Arun Kumar Dalmia, a resident of Jodhpur Park. The KMC authorities have taken preparations before reopening city parks. The civic body’s parks department has employed security guards at entry points of the large parks to make sure that there are no gatherings. “The security guards have been asked to check whether the morning walkers or those who will enter KMC-run parks in the afternoon slot have been vaccinated. The guards have been asked to refuse entry if someone tries to enter without wearing a mask” said a KMC parks department official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/tight-security-cov-safety-arrangements-in-place-as-lakes-and-parks-reopen-today/articleshow/89081709.cms||Suman Chakraborti

A sizeable number of gyms in the city had reopened on January 19 after the state government issued Covid guidelines. The guidelines called for spacing of equipment and individuals in gyms at least six feet apart, mandatory check of vaccination and infection status of members, smaller slots for patrons and redesigning the floor area to reserve 4sqm for each client. While several gyms reopened for business acting upon the guidelines, there were also many who waited to assess the response of members in the first week before resuming business. “We had started with barely 25% of patrons. By this week, it has shot up to around 50%. It is extremely encouraging given the fact that almost every family has suffered because of the third wave which calls for further need of activities to rebuild immunity. Every member has had to change his/her workout style to adjust to the pandemic situation. The steady growth in numbers is encouraging other gyms to start following the revised Covid protocols,” said Gagan Sachdev, owner of Karma Fitness Studio and a representative of the West Bengal Gym owners’ Forum. The state government had instructed gyms to shut down from January 3 following a spurt in Covid numbers. The decision had led to large scale demonstrations from gym owners and trainers across Bengal, following which state government in a fresh relaxation order, allowed gyms to reopen with 50% of the capacity till 9pm, provided all the staff and members are vaccinated and Covid negative. “As the gyms reopened, members took time to assess the situation and have only started returning to gyms from this week. We are checking the vaccination status and infection status of every individual before letting them in. We have also dedicated an hour in the afternoon for thorough sanitization of the entire gym premises,” said Rupam Chakraborty, a fitness expert. Fitness enthusiasts were also happy. “Covid left me drained and I lost a sizeable amount of muscles. I have also grown a visible pot belly. When gyms opened, I still took a couple of days to take stock of the situation before I finally returned to my training from Saturday and I love every bit of sweating it out,” said Souvick Basu, a techie.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/footfall-rises-at-gyms-5-days-after-reopening-more-centres-in-kol-open-doors-to-patrons/articleshow/89081711.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Kolkata||Kolkata airport flyer count up by 17 lakh in 2021 over 2020||KOLKATA: For the Kolkata airport, the second pandemic year was a lot less disruptive than the first year when there were no passenger flights for two months barring a handful of special repatriation services. Passenger count in 2021 was up 18% over 2020, a substantial growth despite the debilitating second and third wave in the fag end of 2021 when the airport appeared nearly deserted as passenger figures crashed. If early developments in 2022 are anything to go by, Kolkata airport should bounce back with domestic travel set to pick up from this summer. But the bigger difference could be international travel with the UAE, countries in Europe as well as the US removing travel restrictions and declaring Covid endemic. Thailand is also initiating “Test and Go” tourist entry programme from February 1. According to Kolkata airport data, nearly 17 lakh more people travelled in January-December 2021 than they did in 2020. In absolute figures, 1.1 crore passengers travelled through Kolkata airport in 2021, up from 94.6 lakh people in 2020. The gains, though, were mostly on the domestic front with scheduled international flights yet to get the go-ahead. While domestic passenger count increased by 24% as corporate as well as leisure travel revived, international travel plunged nearly 58% with several countries announcing stringent travel curbs in the wake of the deadly delta variant in April-May and then virulent Omicron in late December. Consequently, 1,485 fewer international flights operated in 2021 than 2020 when there were 9,238 flights despite the absence of any international flights for three months before Vande Bharat repatriation flights and those operated under the bubble agreement between India and other countries were introduced. Domestic flight count, however, shot up by 26% from 74,284 in 2020 to 93,236 flights in 2021. Overall, the flight count increased from 83,522 to 1,00,989, an increase of 21%. Curiously, passenger count per flight went down from 113.3 in 2020 to 110.3 in 2021. This was primarily due to a drastic decline in occupancy of international flights that went down from 71.9 passengers per flight in 2020 to 35.8 flyers per flight in 2021. On the domestic count, occupancy remained almost unchanged with 118.9 passengers per flight in 2021 against 118.8 passengers per flight in 2020. Airport officials said this was primarily due to prolonged restrictions in flights operated between the Gulf and India as well as between SE Asia and India during the second wave when planes carried passengers into India but flew back nearly empty as the countries had imposed restrictions on people leaving India. “Infection count is slowly receding, and we hope that travel industry will bounce back riding on aviation sector,” said Anil Punjabi, chairman (east) Travel Agents Federation of India. Rahul Wadhwa, chairman of Airlines Operators’ Committee (AOC), said 2021 has already showed them how passenger movement shot back immediately with the fall in infection curve and they hope a repeat in 2022 as well.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/airport-flyer-count-up-by-17l-in-2021-over-2020/articleshow/89081714.cms||Subhro Niyogi

Education minister Bratya Basu will inaugurate the project on Monday. Classes IX to XII had been reopened twice during the pandemic but around 80 lakh students in primary sections haven’t stepped into school premises, resulting in a rise in dropout rate in the section. According to the annual state of education report (ASER) 2020, school dropout rate in Bengal declined from 3.3% to 1.5% in 2019 while it went up to 4% to 5.5% at national level. Paray Shikshalaya is a community-based learning system for primary level students. The main objective is to provide learning support with a joyful open assembly similar to classroom experience. The project will start from February. “An expert committee will prepare a structured academic material for the project for children of the age group of 5-9 years,” said an official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/state-project-to-check-dropout-rate/articleshow/89081715.cms||---

Given 75 hours to work on small areas that were congested, poorly used or just neglected, 31 cities under the Smart City Mission (SCM) developed 50 public spaces with a cumulative area of 1 lakh sq meters to provide citizens better traffic and pedestrian movement, vending facilities or recreation spaces. The success of the "75 hour challenge" with the mini projects termed as "tactical interventions" is set to be taken up for wider replication by municipalities with even ward level committees seeing the potential for turning around drab and dirty surroundings into productive spaces for young and old alike. These projects under what has also been called the “place making marathon” included improvement of streets as also upgradation of parks, including pocket green areas along streets, outdoor infrastructure improvement of anganwadis and public health centres. The Centre has now launched the second phase of the marathon to encourage cities to reimagine one or more public spaces in their city and transform them quickly to showcase tangible change to citizens. “The SCM has promoted the test-learn-scale approach as it is fundamental to bringing about citizen-centric transformations in a sustainable manner. Placemaking is a manifestation of that approach in the transformation of urban spaces. It is a low cost low time (LCLT) method to test an idea and learn from it,” said Kunal Kumar, SCM mission director. For example, an unused and unsafe space under the Vadsar flyover in Vadodara was converted to a play and learning area for an anganwadi at a cost of just Rs 9.85 lakh in three days. The chief architect of Vadodara Smart City Priyank Shah, who led the project, said, “The area beneath the flyover was lying unused. It was dark and had become a hub for anti-social elements. We involved 75 architecture students. Since this project had to be done with less expenditure, we resourced scrap materials from local agencies such as stones and pebbles.” Project lead for Placemaking Marathon Jeenal Salwa said, “The marathon is forging solidarity among cities to build more humane public spaces. We hope to do a couple of more national marathons after which cities can possibly run their own `placemaking' programmes where ward councilors, citizens and technical experts can come together to create a pipeline of local projects.” An underutilized intersection was reclaimed with a vibrant pop-up plaza outside Sher-e-Kashmir Park in Srinagar. The three legged junction outside the park had unauthorized parking, which blocked its entrance and there was no crossing for pedestrians and it also lacked lighting for safety. This intersection was improved with a pop-up plaza to make the park entrance more visible and to improve vehicular traffic flow. Another effort saw the popular Sakkardara Street in Nagpur, turned into which a safe zone for kids with dedicated play areas and lanes demarcated for pedestrians and runners and even temporary exhibition spaces. Earlier, the street had been narrowed by unauthorised parking and mounds of construction debris. The disconnected footpath also made it highly unsafe for walkers. Post its success, the Nagpur administration has constituted an Institutional Apex Committee and Healthy Streets Department which will replicate similar interventions on other major streets and convert them into healthy streets.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/75-hour-challenge-helps-develop-50-public-spaces/articleshow/89081720.cms||Dipak K Dash

The minister, who is an MP from Tikamgarh, was meeting people of Peepat village in Chhatarpur on Saturday when 21-year-old Laxmi Chourasia stepped up and started speaking of their troubles. Laxmi, whose father has migrated to Delhi for work, hurled a barrage of questions at the Union minister: “What do you want from the poor? Why should the poor keep visiting government offices yet their work isn’t done? Isn’t it your duty to resolve the issues faced by the poor?” The minister was taken aback initially and then called the subdivisional magistrate (SDM) and asked him to resolve the issues faced by the girl and her family. The local panchayat secretary was also present. In small villages, panchayat secretaries wield enormous power. Pointing a finger at the secretary, Laxmi looked at the minister and said she had been meeting him (the secretary) and visiting his office with her grievances but returned empty handed. “For 15 years, my father has been working away from home because there are no jobs in Chhatarpur. Since he lives away from us, I have to look after the family,” she said, adding: “We are poor people and entitled to subsidized ration. For one and half years, I have been shuttling between the offices of the collector, tehsil and panchayat, but in vain.” She said that she herself managed resources to dig a pond for their small holding of land but the work was not reimbursed under the government scheme. “How many times do they (officials) want us to submit documents?” she asked the Union minister. Raising her voice, Laxmi said: “This is not my problem alone. Each of us in the village faces the same issues.” The minister asked the SDM to look into the problems and said, “The next time I visit here, such issues should not crop up.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/labourers-daughter-to-union-min-why-should-poor-suffer/articleshow/89081745.cms||Deshdeep Saxena

He said that the chief minister only makes hollow promises, while talking to mediapersons at the party function to mark Neta Subhash Chandra Bose's birth anniversary. He said that all sections of people- farmers, small traders or youth- are facing hardships in the state. Slamming the merger of Amar Jawan Jyoti, Nath said that it reflects the intent of the BJP government. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants history to be rewritten from 2014 and wants to "extinguish" anything that has happened in India’s history before that. But, he should know that people are quite aware and would write a new history in the next Lok Sabha election”, he said. Regarding Guna MP KP Singh Yadav's letter to BJP leadership regarding Jyotiraditya Scindia's hegemony in the state BJP's affairs, Kamal Nath said it was an issue between two BJP leaders and they should sort it out.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/nath-everyone-in-mp-facing-hardship/articleshow/89081748.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: 1,000-year-old Vishnu sculpture restored||BHOPAL: A centuries old sandstone sculpture of the reclining Lord Vishnu in Bandhavgarh National Park has been restored by Indian National Trust for Art and Culture Heritage or INTACH. Popularly known as Shesh Shaiyya, the sculpture belongs to the Kalchuri period and has immense archeological and heritage value. The sandstone sculpture was covered with moss and algae for years. This is the first conservation and restoration project undertaken by INTACH in Madhya Pradesh, Madan Mohan Upadhyay, state convenor of the organization told TOI. After the state government’s consent, the project began last year. Situated at the Tala zone of the famous tiger reserve, the 1,000-year-old sculpture is 40 feet in length. For about two months, this tourist zone was closed for the visitors. Major General Lalit Gupta (retd), chairman of INTACH, visited the park three months ago and it was decided that this unique sculpture would be conserved and restored by the trust. Upadhyay said that an expert team of conservators and professionals was deputed for a thorough study of the stone out of which this sculpture was carved out. The team also studied the nature of the algae and fungus that had accumulated on it for years. Besides, minor floral vegetative growth around it was also studied. “Looking at the archeological significance of the sculpture, utmost care was taken and the steam-cleaning method was used to remove algae and moss. The moss that was covering it has now been completely cleaned,” Upadhyay said . Besides the restoration of the Vishnu temple, an idol of Brahma and a Shivalinga situated close by the reclining Vishnu were also restored. During the conservation operations, the team found an inscription dating back to the Kalchuri period. Pictures of it have been sent to experts to decipher. Basavraj S Annigeri, field director of Bandhavgarh National Park said, “After the restoration work, the tourist zone of Tala has now again been opened for the tourists. The cleaning and conservation operation has enhanced the life of the sculpture.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/1k-yr-old-vishnu-sculpture-restored/articleshow/89081749.cms||Deshdeep Saxena

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has taken a historic step by initiating the PM Micro Food Industry Upgradation Scheme. Under this scheme, the incubation centers of Gwalior, Morena and Sehore will definitely prove to be milestones and usher in a new revolution in promoting the food processing industry in Madhya Pradesh”, Chouhan said while virtually addressing the foundation laying programme organised at Rajmata Vijayaraje Scindia Agricultural University, Gwalior, for stting up of incubation centres in Agriculture College Gwalior, Krishi Vigyan Kendra Morena and Agriculture College Sehore under PM Micro Food Industry Upgradation Scheme. Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar, state agriculture minister Kamal Patel, minister of state for horticulture Bharat Singh Kushwaha also participated in the programme. Chouhan said that there is a need to organise workshops in the state for food processing. “Workshops should be organised to inform farmers about quality improvement, packaging, marketing and branding of their produce and their processes. Under the PM Micro Food Industries Upgradation Scheme, a subsidy of up to Rs 10 lakh will be given to the farmers. 40 percent of the subsidy will be borne by the state government. In order to expand the food processing industry, the state government will provide a subsidy of up to Rs 2.5 crore for setting up large units”, he said. Chouhan said that in the last 15 years, the state has made unprecedented growth in the field of agriculture. “As a result of this, the state has received the Krishi Karman award several times. Madhya Pradesh has set record in agricultural production. A record has been set by purchasing more than 43 lakh metric tonnes of paddy in the state. Today, Madhya Pradesh produces more wheat than Punjab. The state is providing continuous support in fulfilling Prime Minister Modi’s resolve of creating an "Atmanirbhar Bharat", setting new records in the field of agriculture”, he said. He said that agriculture is the backbone of the country’s economy and the state government is working towards fulfilling Prime Minister Modi's resolve to double the income of farmers by encouraging horticulture along with production of crops. Chouhan said that there is a need for diversification of agriculture to increase the income of farmers. “There is a need to boost cultivation of fruits, flowers, vegetables, medicines and agroforestry. It is a matter of happiness that the area under horticulture in the state has exceeded 15 lakh hectares. Fruits, vegetables, spices etc. are being cultivated on a large scale in the state. Having a system for processing these products will definitely increase the income of the farmers”, he said. Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar congratulated Chouhan for making MP a leading state in the country in agriculture production. Tomar said that during Covid when other economic activities had come to a standstill, only agriculture provided strength to the economy.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/mp-top-producer-of-oranges-garlic-cm/articleshow/89081750.cms||---

Apart from the number of cases and the positivity rate, Sunday also witnessed the hospital bed occupancy dip below the 2,500-mark after 10 days. On January 13, when Delhi recorded 28,867 cases with a positivity rate of 29.21%, 2,424 Covid beds in hospitals were occupied. The number of beds occupied saw an increase since then, even though the spike was not as alarming as that of cases and positivity rate. After the number of occupied hospital beds reached 2,784 on January 17, the numbers went down and on Sunday, a total of 2,424 beds were occupied.

---||Delhi||Records swept away: Highest January rainfall in Delhi since 1901||NEW DELHI: With 88.2mm of rainfall till 8.30am on January 23, this has been the wettest January for Delhi in 122 years. India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Sunday said Safdarjung had received the highest rainfall this January since 1901, the year from when rainfall records are maintained for the city’s base weather station. It broke the previous all-time record of 1989 when 79.7mm rainfall was received. Palam, too, broke the all-time record by logging 110mm of rainfall till Sunday, which is double the previous record of 55mm in 1973. IMD maintains records for Palam from 1950. Meanwhile, Lodhi Road, Ridge and Aya Nagar have so far recorded 96.7mm, 86.2mm and 93.7mm of rainfall, respectively, this month. Safdarjung received 19.7mm of rainfall over 24 hours till 8.30am on Sunday. It logged 4.9mm of rainfall on Saturday and 63.6mm from January 7 to 9. The cumulative rainfall data for January this year stands at 88.2mm of rainfall, while the normal rainfall mark for the month is just 21.7mm. “Due to two active western disturbances, Delhi received excess rain this January,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist at IMD. The Met department said rain was unlikely from January 24 to 29. The maximum temperature was recorded at 14.9 degrees Celsius, six degrees below normal. However, the minimum temperature remained on the higher side as night temperature settled at 10.5 degrees Celsius, three degrees above normal. As the minimum temperature is likely to dip below 10 degrees Celsius, IMD has predicted cold day conditions at a few places on Monday. The forecast says maximum and minimum temperatures are likely to be around 16 and 7 degrees Celsius, respectively, on Monday along with moderate fog in the morning. “The night temperature is expected to fall from Monday. Cold day conditions are predicted for Monday and Tuesday,” said Jenamani. Rain also helped in improving Delhi’s air quality by washing out the pollutants. The overall air quality index (AQI) was 202 in the “poor” category on Sunday as against 316 in the “very poor” category on Saturday. System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research said, “AQI improved significantly due to wet deposition of particulate matter by rain. A dust storm that originated from the Gulf region is headed towards the Gujarat coast and parts of Maharashtra. However, it is unlikely to affect air quality of Delhi due to the prevailing influence of western disturbance and drizzle/rain. From January 24, dry weather conditions are likely to prevail, partially offset by moderate ventilation, resulting in gradual accumulation of pollutants.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/records-swept-away-highest-jan-rainfall-in-delhi-since-1901/articleshow/89080718.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: Some title deeds obtained via fraud, impersonation||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Though ruling political parties, including CPM and CPI, are playing it safe regarding the cancellation of land titles in Devikulam known as ‘Raveendran Pattayams’ stating that no one will lose land, the proceedings issued by Devikulam sub-collector that ordered cancellation of four such titles show that some of them were obtained through grave fraud and impersonation. Renu Raj, the then Devikulam sub-collector, on September 24, 2019, initiated proceedings by hearing four land owners — Alagarswami, Muthu, Sudha and Chinnathai— in whose names land titles were issued (LA 96/99, 94/99, 97/99 and 54/99) by MI Raveendran in Kanan Devan Hills (KDH) village. The sub-collector inquired into the matter based on a petition that one Mariyadas managed to obtain 15 titles in the name of his employees and relatives in KDH village. In the hearing, the individuals in whose names the land titles were issued gave statements that proved that some of them did not even know that there was land in their name in the village. In his statement, Alagarswami stated that he had worked as a driver for Mariyadas who made him sign several papers by promising him that he would get land, but even now he does not have his own land or house. Muthu’s son, who appeared before the sub-collector (Muthu died in 2016), stated that his father was also a driver working for Mariyadas, and they did not have knowledge of any such land in his father’s name. Suja, a close relative of Mariyadas and another land owner, stated that the signature on the land title is not hers, and Mariyadas threatened her of dire consequences if she revealed the truth. The fourth owner, Chinnathai, said that he was a resident of Kottakamboor village and had not applied for land in Munnar. Some other owners of the land in question did not appear for hearing despite notices being served. Based on all these, the sub-collector ordered cancellation of the titles found to have been forged, while ordering a detailed inquiry into the remaining ones. The farcicality of statements by revenue minister K Rajan and other CPM and CPI leaders, including CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, CPM leader and former power minister M M Mani, is evident if read along with the findings of the sub-collector with regard to the titles included in the category of Raveendran Pattayams. Rajan had on Thursday said that no one will be evicted due to cancellation of these titles, and the cancellation of these titles are being undertaken only because of the “procedural irregularities”. He said that all of them can apply for fresh titles and it will be issued within two months. Other leaders also had given similar versions.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/some-title-deeds-obtained-via-fraud-impersonation/articleshow/89081766.cms||KP Saikiran

The police used primitive torture methods against the girl’s parents during interrogation. Until the real accused confessed to the crime during the interrogation of another murder, the Kovalam police were on the course of arraigning the girl’s mother as the accused in the FIR. Hence, if the same police conducted further investigation and filed a charge sheet in the case, it would not be fair to the parents of the deceased girl.Moreover, there is a need to probe into the lapses committed by the local police which led them to believe that the parents committed the crime. Hence, it warrants a probe by a better agency like crime branch, the MLA said.The case pertains to the alleged murder of a 14-year-old girl by her neighbours, a mother and son, in January last year. The girl was found unconscious in her house and died the next day at a hospital. During their interrogation related to another murder case under Vizhinjam police station limits accused Shafeeq and his mother Rafeeqa revealed that they had attacked the girl which led to her death.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/mla-seeks-crime-branch-probe-into-14-yr-olds-murder/articleshow/89081768.cms||---

The third wave has hit the functioning of the corporation badly,” an official said. Senior officials with the health department have also tested positive for Covid-19. This has affected the corporation’s ongoing campaign against plastic-waste management. It has also put a dampener on the mass cleaning drive being planned this month ahead of the anti-plastic campaign. The city corporation has recently introduced restrictions on public entry due to the rise in Covid cases. Those aged above 60, pregnant women, children, and patients will not be allowed to enter the corporation office. One person may be allowed entry into the corporation office and no groups shall be entertained. The public shall enter their details at the front office.

---||Delhi||Delhi home truths: Out in open, reality & cold bites have-nots||NEW DELHI: Despite biting cold, a large number of the city’s homeless continue to sleep in the open — along the river and drains, under flyovers, on footpaths, and in parks and verandahs. According to Centre for Holistic Development (CHD), a not-for-profit organisation working for the deprived, 106 unidentified bodies have been recovered by police in the national capital from January 1 to 18, at least 80% of them homeless. While the civil society alleges that lack of beds in the night shelters forces the homeless to sleep in the open, shelter board officials counter that most don’t want to sleep in the rain baseras and miss out on the “charity” given by people. According to a 2014 survey, Delhi has an estimated 16,760 homeless; United Nations Development Programme puts the number at 55,955; and a 2011 census found 44,724 such people. The civil society, however, believes at least 1% of the city’s 1.8 crore population lives on the streets or footpaths. As per Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB), which manages these facilities, 9,270 people can be accommodated in 306 shelters — RCC building, porta cabins, temporary buildings, tents and isolation centres. Its occupancy report states close to 8,200 people reach these centres each night. But CHD executive director Sunil Kumar Aledia alleged that the actual capacity was only about 4,000 and those beds got filled by 6pm. In his letter to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, who is also the chairman of DUSIB, Aledia said more than 7,000 homeless didn’t have space in the shelters and had been unwillingly sleeping in the open. Kashmere Gate, Yamuna Pushta, Nigambodh Ghat, Yamuna Ghat, Chandni Chowk, Delhi Gate, Jama Masjid, Kingsway Camp, Okhla, Nizamuddin and Sarai Kale Khan are some of the areas that have high concentration of these people. “As per our estimates, more than one lakh people in Delhi are forced to sleep in the open…We request you to arrange shelter... in this harsh winter,” Aledia urged in the letter. The original capacity of the 306 shelters is over 19,900, but it has been revised to 9,270 to follow social distancing norms due to Covid-19. DUSIB member-expert Bipin Rai, however, claimed that the shelters had enough capacity. “We do send our rescue teams if we get to know of any homeless sleeping in the open. But most of the times, they refuse to go to shelters,” Rai said. DUSIB is willing to set up temporary shelters of pagoda tents anywhere there is a concentration of such people, he pointed out. “We have enough tents that can be pitched wherever required. The government is quite sensitive to this issue and we leave no stone unturned to provide basic facilities to the homeless,” Rai said. “We have a team of doctors regularly monitoring the health of the homeless, and with the help of Akshay Patra Foundation, we are providing them hygienic food three times a day,” he added. Indu Prakash Singh, member of the Supreme Court-appointed monitoring committee for the urban homeless, said it was time the civil society and the general public worked together to ensure the basic facilities for the deprived. People can use the Rain Basera mobile application to click pictures of homeless people without shelter and upload them on the app, Singh said, adding that government teams will reach them with the help of geolocation of the photographs. “DUSIB has assured that they can create temporary shelters wherever required and funds won’t be a problem,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/home-truths-out-in-open-reality-cold-bites-have-nots/articleshow/89080727.cms||Atul Mathur

The order was issued based on a request filed by the director of the museum and zoo. The authorities have been directed that while permitting use of professional cameras inside museums, steps shall be taken to ensure that it does not affect the privacy of other visitors and that the security of intellectual properties inside the museum shall be ensured. The order will give opportunities for art buffs and vloggers to make video recordings of the exhibits inside art galleries and museums. Thiruvananthapuram zoo already levies a price to use cameras on its premises. Authorities expect that the Natural History Museum and the Napier Museum will likely draw more crowds with permission being given for the use of cameras inside the building. The renovated Natural History Museum which was reopened to the public in January 2021 has been drawing attention from visitors for the past few months. The museum was equipped with attractive and informative display systems and the project was completed at a cost of Rs 6 crore. The museum underwent a complete renovation for the first time after it started functioning in 1964.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/use-camera-inside-museums-at-a-price/articleshow/89081773.cms||---

In his letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that deputation rules in its present form itself are heavily loaded in favour of the Union and bringing further stringency will weaken the very root of cooperative federalism. “The government of Kerala is of the opinion that these proposed amendments may be dropped,” he said. The chief minister further said that the proposed amendments will definitely induce fear psychosis and an attitude of hesitancy among AIS officers to implement policies of a state government, which are formed by parties politically opposed by the ruling party at the Centre. “We need to recognize that in a vibrant democratic and federal polity, states and the Centre can be ruled by political formations with vastly different ideologies and political views. But these governments function within the framework of the Constitution,” he said. The Centre had proposed four amendments to the rules six of the Indian administrative service (cadre) rules, 1954. At present, the officers need to receive a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the state government for their central deputation. As per the new amendment, if the states fail to give the NoC within a specified time, the officer shall be deemed to have been relieved from the date specified by the Centre. As per the existing rules, the states have to depute AIS officers to the Centre and at any point of time, the deputation strength cannot be more than 40% of the total strength. The proposed amendments say that the Centre will decide the actual number of officers to be deputed to it. The proposed amendments also say that in case of any disagreement between the Centre and the state, the Centre will decide and the states should give effect to the decision within a specific time.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/state-opposes-amendments-to-deputation-rules/articleshow/89081775.cms||---

As per the data of arrests and raids over the last four years analysed by the state police team countering child sex exploitation (CCSE), the trend shows that the cases of sexually exploiting children spikes every two months after a crackdown on such persons. Also, the number of porn groups operating over platforms like Whatsapp and Telegram have increased dramatically during this period. “Due to the police action through initiatives like Operation P-Hunt, most accused who watch such videos delete them after watching using specialized software to evade detection. Many of them format their phone every three days,” says ADGP (headquarters) Manoj Abraham, who is in charge of the state Cyberdome and leading the action. Use of malwares to activate webcams of the victim to steal information of the target children has also been reported in certain cases. “In a few cases we have also seen online live sex sessions involving children that are available on payment over restricted links,” he said. As many as 2,280 searches have been conducted, 1,235 cases registered, 258 persons have been arrested and 1693 devices used for circulating and storing such material have been seized since 2017. The maximum number of searches were conducted last year, when 1,273 premises were searched statewide, in which 450 cases were registered and 39 persons were arrested. Under the operational supervision of district police chiefs, simultaneous raids were conducted throughout the state last Sunday as part of a crackdown on promoters of child pornographic material. In the raids, the police team registered 161 cases, and seized 186 devices that include mobile phones, modems, hard disks, memory cards, laptops, computers etc that contained sexually explicit videos and pictures of children. “The distressing part is that many of these videos and pictures appear to be of local children, in the age group of 5-16 years,” said Abraham . As many as 10 persons were arrested, including youngsters employed as professionals in reputed companies, and most of them are IT savvy. This is the reason why they were using all kinds of encrypted handles to upload and download the material. Some are suspected to be involved in child trafficking too as there are many chats to this effect on their devices, he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/after-a-crackdown-accused-return-armed-with-better-tech/articleshow/89081776.cms||KP Saikiran

It was a drop of 25% in a day from 8,194 on Saturday. At 16,617, it was a six-day low for Gujarat. With the update, the active cases in Ahmedabad district including the city reached 52,281 — accounting for four of every 10 active cases in Gujarat. The drop in the middle of steadily rising cases surprised experts, who pointed out that the testing figures for Saturday and Sunday were not available on the state’s Covid portals. On the ground, testing numbers have not recorded any drastic change. “It will be too early to say that the cases are on a downward trend. After a slight drop on Friday, cases again spiked on Saturday,” said a city-based epidemiologist. “Thus, there’s no pattern here. But the most striking aspect is that five of eight municipal corporation areas recorded a dip in cases.” While Ahmedabad had a 25% drop, in Rajkot cases fell from 1,707 to 410; in Jamnagar, from 563 to 138; in Gandhinagar, from 547 to 398; and in Junagadh, from 104 to 80. Vadodara, Surat, and Bhavnagar’s daily tally were nearly the same at about 2,800, 1,600, and 400 cases respectively. The state’s death toll however increased to 19, the highest in the past seven months. The deaths included 6 from Ahmedabad city, 3 from Valsad, 2 each from Surat city and district, and Banaskantha, and 1 each from Bhavnagar city, Mehsana, Navsari, and Dahod districts. Ahmedabad city has recorded 36 deaths over the past seven days. Gujarat in 24 hours vaccinated 29,481 persons for the first dose and 70,031 for the second. In all, 5.07 crore have been administered the first dose and 4.47 crore the second shot of the Covid vaccine.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/city-records-drop-of-25-in-daily-tally/articleshow/89081778.cms||---

Even those who were infected earlier or are fully vaccinated are getting caught in the wave due to the immune-escape nature of the variant. But what exactly is the reason behind low severity and mortality? One of the answers could be found in the fact that the T-cells or long-term memory cells of the body’s immune system are better equipped to tackle Covid, said scientific experts participating in a session on ‘T-cell immunity and Covid-19’. The event was organized by the Indian Institute of Public Health Gandhinagar (IIPH-G) and Institute of Science at Nirma University. The speakers for the event included Dr Sarat Dalai, Dr Amit Awasthi, and Dr Sunil Kumar Raghav. The session was moderated by Dr Senthil Natesan, associate professor at IIPH-G. Dr Awasthi spoke about cellular immunity and Covid-19. He shared his experience of checking the immune response in a large number of individuals with mild, moderate and severe Covid infection. The findings revealed that the immune response was proportional to the level of infection. He also explained how different barriers across early infection mediated response – both from the antibodies and T-cells. He said that the new vaccines against Covid would have to integrate elements from various variants to keep it potent against future mutations. On T-cell immunity against natural infection and vaccinations, he said that when a lot of people are recovering without adequate acquired antibodies, the T cell immunity comes into the picture. He said that the T-cells can clear the infection early on, so that the disease doesn’t take a severe form, thus helping in early recovery. Dr Raghav also spoke about asymptomatic contacts of Covid infected patients and said that they have found protective immune signatures. The asymptomatic patients had a high chance of getting the disease, but they did not. It showed that the cytokine profile of the people with and without disease were different. The benefits primarily came from the T-cell response as they somehow prevented the severe infection.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/t-cell-immunity-to-play-key-role-in-the-long-run/articleshow/89081779.cms||---

The Civil Hospital witnessed major queues outside and the private hospitals had to set up a system so that the patients don’t die on the road while waiting for a bed — the reason was apparent, about 90% of the available beds were full. As the city touched 6,000 cases on Sunday, the hospitals were under no duress – even as the number of beds got decreased by 33%, the vacancy was 90%. It was also the scenario at Civil Hospital where out of 1,200 available beds, 114 were occupied by the Covid patients. “The primary reason is the Omicron variant’s tendency not to target the lungs. Today, 95% of the patients come out of the Covid infection after 3-4 days with milder symptoms. Last year’s surge was due to high oxygen dependency by majority of the hospitalized patients,” said a senior city-based hospital administrator.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/wave-of-relief-90-occupancy-to-90-vacancy-in-hospitals/articleshow/89081781.cms||---

Likewise, it had taken four days from January 15 to double from 60 to 125.In Ahmedabad, the number of patients on ventilators reached 21, a slight drop from 25 on January 21. In the government-run hospitals, about 25% of the patients require ICU treatment or ventilator, said officials. Dr Amit Prajapati, a city-based critical care specialist, said old age and comorbid conditions are the primary reasons for the patients requiring intensive care. “A small number even turn hypoxic,” he said.

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: ‘Pharma marketing influences prescriptions of 98% doctors’||AHMEDABAD: Just what effect does marketing activities of pharmaceutical companies have on the prescription behaviour of doctors in the four major cities of the state. A three-year research on the issue conducted by the school of management at Gujarat Technological University (GTU) involving 1,100 doctors clearly showed that 97.6% of doctors had entertained promotional activities by pharmaceutical companies. An overwhelming majority of doctors — be it paediatricians, dentists, general practitioners, gynaecologists or consulting physicians — had agreed that three major activities — customer relationship management, sponsorship, and medical representative’s knowledge of their product — influenced their decision for prescriptions. The doctors also revealed several other factors like subscriptions to costly medical journals, a greater number of trail packs or samples, targeted digital marketing and repeated reminders by the medical representative to prescribe their medicines to have an influence over their prescription behaviour. The researcher, Krunal Vishavadia of school of management at GTU, broke down the intensity of the above mentioned marketing tools — for instance 88% doctors wanted that MRs should have a detailed knowledge about their product, 91% doctors claimed pharma companies efforts on continuous medical education (CME) of doctors influence prescription behaviour, 98% doctors agreed that tactics of customer relationship management played a vital role, whereas 75% of doctors had agreed that the number of free samples doled out has an effect on doctor’s prescription behaviour. There were 23% of doctors who remained neutral on this aspect, claimed Vishavadia. When it comes to sponsorships by drug companies — high valued gift items, medical product or payments towards international conferences — the doctors refused to reveal any reaction to the researcher. In fact, the existence of the Uniform Code of Pharmaceutical Marketing Practices (UCPMP) was known to many doctors in the study. While giving a break-up of the pool of doctors from an inventory list of 3.7 lakh practitioners in the country, Vishavadia claimed that general practitioners (GP, MBBS and GP, Non-MBBS) constitute 34% of the total doctors who are responsible for 39% of prescriptions. Dentists are the second biggest specialty with a 14% contribution with a prescription share of 11%, followed by consultant physicians with 8% contribution and 8% prescription share. Paediatricians had the highest prescriptions per month with an average of 788 prescriptions or 26 prescriptions per day.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/pharma-marketing-influences-prescriptions-of-98-doctors/articleshow/89081783.cms||---

Speaking at the inauguration of an e-library at Sardar Dham, the senior BJP leader referred to the deceased family, a group of Patels from Kalol taluka. He said the lack of opportunities here forces people to go overseas in search of a better life.  “Four people froze to death on the Canada-US border while they were going to the US,” the former deputy CM said. “Do you know why this incident happened? It is because their future does not become bright here.” Patel added: “Despite putting in a lot of hard work and studying a lot, (people) are not able to get a good position.” He went on to say: “This is why people have to undertake such a difficult struggle.” It is suspected that the family which froze to death was from Dingucha village of Gandhinagar district. The family had left for Canada about ten days ago.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/opportunities-missing-hence-such-tragedies/articleshow/89081784.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Three countries target people smugglers||Ahmedabad: After news emerged on Saturday that a family of four from Gujarat had frozen to death on the Canada-US border, Gujarat Police officers said on Sunday that the three countries will launch a probe. The Gujarat Police officers said that the security agencies of Canada and the US, and the Indian police will focus on the larger racket of illegal immigration. The officers said that the state CID (crime) has been assigned the task of unearthing the network of human traffickers targeting Gandhinagar and parts of central and north Gujarat. The victims are Jagdish Patel, 35; his wife, Vaishali, 33; and their children Vihanga, 12, and Dharmik, 3. They were residents of Nava Dingucha village in Kalol taluka of Gandhinagar. They were reportedly separated from a larger group of Indians who made it across the border to the US in -35 degrees celsius temperature. Their bodies were found just 30 feet from the US border on the Canadian side. The family had left for Canada about 10 days ago. “Earlier, the traffickers used to provide entry to illegal immigrants from the southern border of the US with Mexico or from Havana in Cuba,” said a police officer. “But the US authorities have tightened controls on the southern border. So the preferred route for traffickers these days is through Canada.” The officer said a travel agent from north Gujarat and another from Mumbai are under the scanner. He said they helped the Patel family travel to Canada. “We strongly suspect that these two agents were in constant touch with a Florida resident named Steve Shand,” the officer said. “We believe this Florida man played a part in planning the illegal crossing into the US for the family and seven others.” The officer said that the security agencies of the US and Canada have already started a probe and they will coordinate with the Indian police to bust the human trafficking racket. Sources said that the four were expecting to be picked up by someone and they had been walking in freezing conditions for about 11 hours. One of the group’s members had a backpack with children’s belongings It turned out he was carrying them for the family, which was eventually separated during a blizzard. A team of the Gujarat Police has been talking with the people of the Kalol village to determine the whereabouts of the travel agents.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/3-countries-target-people-smugglers/articleshow/89081785.cms||Ashish Chauhan
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarati producer makes BAFTA list khoob-Surat||AHMEDABAD: As a star-struck teenager, Surat-born Rajita Shah never imagined her love for vintage Hollywood films on Turner Classic would pave way for her moment in the sun. “We did not have much exposure to Bollywood. Thus, when I finally encountered it in full force, I was already in the US, studying filmmaking,” she says. Over two decades later, here she is, winning accolades as a producer of sleeper hit Love Sarah – the first movie to screen in the UK and other countries after Covid restrictions were lifted – under her banner Miraj Films. Shah recently made it to the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) Breakthrough 2021 list comprising 25 actors, directors, producers, writers, cinematographers, etc. working in the UK. She was the only Indian-origin person to receive the 2021 honours, and one of the few to be featured over the years. “It’s a very prestigious selection by BAFTA that chooses two producers every year. It means a lot of support from the BAFTA team in helping the company expand, assistance in mentorship with big production companies, and creating a solid profile in industry,” said Shah. Daughter of Surat-based businessman Rajan Shah and Mita Shah, Rajita is an alumna of School of Visual Arts in the US and Royal Holloway London University in production and filmmaking. She tried her hand at short films and direction but realized that production was her calling. “BAFTA Breakthrough is the recognition for the work I have done in the past 10 years. After Love Sarah, I have been working on two projects including a fascinating real-life story of women’s football in the UK from 1929 to 1970s. Two of my executive producers — Paras Mehta and Kartik Shah — are from Surat,” said Shah, adding that she also plans to adapt two acclaimed books, Our Endless Numbered Days and Kika & Me, for celluloid. If one compares work with the Indian film industry, the challenges are the same, avers Shah, who has been working in the UK for the past two decades. “There are only a few women filmmakers in a country like India, which is shocking, given the number of films produced annually. So, I believe that people like me can improve diversity and give an impetus to new voices,” she says. Through her projects, she also wants to represent the Indian community in India and abroad “in the right perspective”. Her grandmother’s narration of stories of Lord Krishna fuelled her ambition to be a successful storyteller herself one day, she says. The other films produced by her company include And It Was the Same With My Son, Zohra: A Moroccan Fairytale, Jubilee, and Crimson among others. “So far, our work has centered around intimate stories, but we will expand the scope in the upcoming projects. If we get the right projects, we will surely work with Indian talents,” said Shah.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/gujarati-producer-makes-bafta-list-khoob-surat/articleshow/89081786.cms||Parth Shastri

---||Ahmedabad||Non-resident inclusivity raga: Gujarati hits in Beethoven land||AHMEDABAD: When one thinks of Germany and music, the symphony of thoughts usually leads to Beethoven, but many Germans have found their ode to joy in famous Gujarati songs. The highpoint of a new cultural flourish was heard by a gathering at Stadtkirche Sankt Michael, or St Michael church, in the German city of Jena. These were the ragas of romanticism composed by the revered Gujarati poet Zaverchand Meghani. The songs played that day included “Ho raj mane laagyo kasumbi no rang” and “Man mor bani thangaat kare”. These are timeless classics in Gujarat. On October 15 last year, Hardik Chauhan, originally from Ahmedabad’s Asarwa, sung them at the Jena church. And the chorus that swelled to the rafters was provided by German singers. The renditions of Chauhan and his German friends have orchestrated a social media rage. They are dancing across messaging platforms and have registered 1 lakh hits on YouTube. Chauhan is now singing paeans to his German choir called Collegium Vocale, Jena. “They believe in real inclusivity and helped me learn German and understand their culture,” he said. “They gave me an opportunity to perform at theatres in Germany and at concerts.” Chauhan, 29, is a biomedical engineer. Chauhan inherited his love for music from his father, Kamlesh. Chauhan honed his talent by singing with several music groups in Ahmedabad. He said when he was a student at Gandhinagar’s Government Engineering College, he started working with theatre artists such as Pravin Pandya, Nisarg Trivedi, Mallika Sarabhai, and Raju Barot. By the time Chauhan landed in Germany in 2016 to pursue higher education he was already a proficient vocalist. “I was learning German for my master’s and studied at Ernst Abbe Hochschule in Jena,” Chauhan said. “I also joined the troupe of German National Theatre, Weimar. I learnt German not only for my academic course but also to become better assimilated.” Chauhan said he was part of musicals and later joined the Collegium Vocale student choir of Friedrich Schiller University, Jena. “I have been singing with them for more than four years,” he said. On singing Meghani’s doha at St Michael’s, Chauhan said: “My choir asked me to perform at a concert, which was scheduled the very next day on October 15, 2021.” He added: “I told them that I could perform only in my mother tongue. During rehearsals, I sang solo with the Germans humming in the background.” Chauhan then requested his friends to learn a few Gujarati words. “They went a step farther,” Chauhan said. “They were willing to learn Gujarati compositions. I gave them a thematic translation of ‘Man mor bani thangaat kare’ and the beauty of the work moved them.” He said his German friends learnt to sing the chorus part and caught all the notes perfectly in just 20 minutes. Since then, Chauhan and his fellow singers have rendered Gujarati compositions at several concerts. “My friends’ musical sharpness and their eagerness to sing in another language is both astounding and touching,” Chauhan said. “Their commitment was 100% so they were able to do justice to Gujarati compositions.” He said he cherishes the opportunity he was given. “My fellow musicians gave me full creative freedom,” he said. “All the credit for the performances goes to them. They went out of their comfort zone and delivered their best with full zest.” As for the audience’s response to the first event, Chauhan said: “We had sung ‘Kasumbi no rang’ and Saumya Joshi’s ‘Sapna vinani raat’. A gentleman approached me and said that the performance had given him goosebumps.” Chauhan said that local audiences want to hear more music from other countries. “It shows how open they are to new cultural experiences,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/non-resident-inclusivity-raga-gujarati-hits-in-beethoven-land/articleshow/89081791.cms||Bharat Yagnik

---||Delhi||Online education yet to reach up to 70% kids in India, says study; makes case for reopening schools||NEW DELHI: A recent study on the effects of prolonged school closure has revealed that effectiveness and penetration of efforts made towards online education have remained “woefully inadequate” across the country, with 40-70% children without a device at home. The study, published by Boston Consulting Group, stated that over 80% of teachers expressed “impossibility” of maintaining an emotional connect in the online mode and that approximately 90% of children lost at least one specific language ability. The study suggested that India move to a philosophy of schools being the “last to close and first to open”, instead of the other way round, and act on four key areas. “First, decentralise school reopening and closures — at the ward, gram panchayat or school level, with clearly defined norms. Offer blended learning construct through the year, in addition to offline, continue online education. Strengthen testing, vaccination, safety protocol and ventilation,” said the study. It showed that due to centralised decision-making, even in districts where there were less than 25 daily Covid cases, schools were forced shut. “Since 2020, many countries have moved from the national or state level to a lower unit of governance to avoid mass school closure. For example, US, UK, Australia and Pakistan have defined clear norms for schools to open and close at district, county or school levels,” the study said. Governments should also build a robust mid-term roadmap to bridge the learning gap, with adequate infrastructure upgrade and funding support, and education should be prioritised by regularly monitoring in-school preparedness and adherence to protocols by local administrators, the study suggested. Further, it said prolonged school closures had resulted in implications that were beyond learning, including aspects like increased child exploitation and social and emotional issues. Stating that according to multiple surveys, more than 80% of parents were in favour of schools reopening, the study said that 37% responded that their child didn’t study at all at home, 70% said the child didn’t have tests or exams in the past three months, and 49% said their kid is facing an improper schedule. “While schools were globally shut in 2020 (first half), many countries kept schools largely open through 2021 – Australia (85-90% open), South Africa (80-85%), UK (70-75%), US (75-80%) – despite considerably higher disease incidence than India…” the study said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/online-edu-yet-to-reach-up-to-70-of-children-says-study-makes-case-for-reopening-schools/articleshow/89080730.cms||Shinjini Ghosh

Locals say the bloody sport will continue till March as it is a tradition and one of the major attractions of the local temple festivals. Unlike East Godavari, West Godavari, Krishna and Guntur districts, cockfights commenced much before Sankranti festival in NCAP. Though betting operations are less when compared to Godavari districts, organisers are finding new venues to conduct the sport during local deity festivals which started on January and will continue till March. Vizag rural police have busted cockfights at various places in the past few days and seized over 30 roosters and over 10,000 in cash from the organisers and punters. Similarly, Vizianagaram police stopped over 10 cockfight events even after Sankranti festivals and seized over 15 roosters. “Cockfights in Godavari districts and parts of Krishna and Guntur districts are celebrated with festive spirit in the fields only during the three-day Sankranti festival. But, in Vizag region, rooster fights are a steady and regular event with low betting operations. Cockfights commence in December and continue for three to four months in a phased manner,” says S Srinivas, a punter in Vizag region.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/local-fests-make-cocks-fight-post-sankranti/articleshow/89081800.cms||Nalla.Babu

But even after nearly one-and-a-half years, the state is yet to reconstitute the child rights body.APSCPCR is the premier mechanism for redressing child grievances in Andhra Pradesh. The primary objective of the commission is to ensure that all laws, policies, and administrative mechanisms are in consonance with the perspective of child rights.The commission also undertakes awareness programmes and consultations with stakeholders from time to time in this regard.Child rights activists point to the need for immediate reconstitution of this child rights body, particularly in view of the pandemic situation. They say that Covid-19 has affected the children on various fronts, including education, dropouts, child marriages, child abuse, domestic violence, etc.Member, Southern States Right to Education Forum Steering Committee, Narava Prakasa Rao said that the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 provides a legal guarantee for children in the six to 14 years’ group. “This Act came into force in 2010. This stems from the fundamental right to education as laid down under the Article 21A. Both the central and state governments are responsible for the implementation of the legislation. The SCPCR is a constitutional state body created under the provisions of the Act and is responsible for monitoring the implementation of the Act in Andhra Pradesh,” said Prakasa Rao.“The government issued two notifications and conducted interviews for the selection of SCPCR members in September 2021. But even five months after the interviews, SCPCR was not constituted,” said Prakasa Rao.Every panchayat should form a vigilance committee to prevent child marriages and other child right violations. But in practice, the majority do not know their role and responsibility in implementing the Child Protection Policy.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/one-yr-on-ap-yet-to-get-child-rights-panel/articleshow/89081807.cms||---

However, doctors have cautioned that continuous surveillance and sampling should continue in order to avoid any further spread in the near future. According to state health department records, a total of 23,632 fresh cases have been reported in the last nine days against 34,190 recoveries. The positivity rate halved in the past nine days to 74.58 compared to 144.41 days. On Sunday, the state reported 1,269 fresh cases 3,423 recoveries and eight deaths. Talking to TOI, state epidemiologist Dr Praveen Karn said, “We have already crossed the peak on January 8 this year with a positivity rate of 6.98%. The state witnessed the maximum number of cases on January 8 and a fortnight later, the number of cases went down and now the cases are showing a downward trend.” 'No. of cases in hosps less because of vax'He added, "The results are an outcome of the immunity developed due to the vaccines. The immunity has led to a reduction in the number of patients being hospitalised and most of the patients have recovered within five-six days." Asked if anything else is responsible for the infection being mild this time, besides the vaccine-induced immunity, Dr Karn said, "A big chunk of the patients who got infected have a CT value of more than 25 and that has helped us in deducting that the peak has passed by." However, doctors have cautioned that constant surveillance and increased sampling of those residing in areas where the vaccination coverage is low is very important. "Omicron has proven to be an immune invader so double dose of the vaccines and continuous sampling can only provide us with important information about the behaviour of the virus in the days to come," said Dr Pradip Bhattacharya, professor of critical care and head of trauma centre at Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences, Ranchi. Meanwhile, as per the Covid bulletin issued on Saturday night, 1,755 fresh cases emerged and 3,888 people recovered while nine persons died.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/state-crossed-peak-of-cov-3rd-wave-on-jan-8/articleshow/89081810.cms||Gaurav Pandey

It was the second Maoist incident in Giridih in the last two days. On Friday night, the Maoists also blew up two mobile phone towers under Khukhra and Madhuban police station areas. A blast also took place on the Howrah-Mumbai route in West Singhbhum on Saturday night but Maoists’ hand was ruled out. The officials said a fog safety device exploded without causing damage to the tracks. Maoist violence reflects frustration with arrest of top leaders, says IGNotably, the rebels have increased their activity in Jharkhand as part of their 'pratirodh saptah' observed in Bihar and Jharkhand from January 21 to 26 and a bandh on January 27 to demand the political prisoner status for their leader, Prashant Bose alias Kishan da and his wife Sheela Marandi. They also demanded their leaders' better medical treatment and their release. Both the Maoist leaders were arrested from Seraikela-Kharsawan district on November 12 last year along with some of their aides. They are now lodged in Birsa Munda Central Jail in Ranchi. Talking to TOI about the blast in Giridih, inspector general (operations) Amol Homkar said, "We are trying to identify the Maoists squad and members involved in the crime. We have intensified our operations in the area." He added that the acts of violence by the Maoists reflect their frustration over the arrest of their top leaders. A CRPF official said the Maoists planted an improvised explosive device between a pillar and the plinth of the newly constructed bridge and blasted a portion of the structure. He said the place of the incident lies in the interior area and the nearest CRPF camp is located about 10 kilometres away. The bridge, which serves as a link between Giridih and Dumri blocks, is now closed to traffic. Meanwhile, the explosion on the tracks in West Singhbhum affected the movement of passenger trains for over 20 minutes. A railway official said, "The explosion took place between Derowan and Posoita stations of Chakradharpur railway division under Goilkera police station." Senior commercial manager of the division, Manish Kumar Pathak, said, "A fog safety device exploded when a goods train was crossing through. The device is a railway property." Following the explosion, Mumbai-bound Gitanjali Express, Puri-bound Kalinga Utkal Express and Durg-Danapur South Bihar Express were controlled as the rail authorities inspected the blast site.

The Jharkhand Small Industries Association (JSIA), the umbrella organization of the MSME units in the state, said they will write to Union power minister R K Singh and seek the Centre’s intervention in ironing out the differences between the DVC and the state government over the amassing dues of the state-run discom Jharkhand Bijli Vitran Nigam Limited (JBVNL). The JSIA has expressed concern over the shortage of power in DVC’s command areas such as districts like Hazaribag, Koderma, Chatra, Giridih and Ramgarh, which is home to several MSME production units. “The Jharkhand government and the DVC have been warring over the non-payment of JBVNL’s dues and the industrial units are suffering due to the power cuts, which are extending up to 12-14 hours every day. Many rural industrial units are on the verge of closure. Why should the industries suffer?” a JSIA official said, adding, “The government must sort out its issues with the DVC but that has not happened.” Besides the power outages, the state’s MSME units are also hit by the hike in commercial electricity tariff by the JBVNL, which now stands at Rs 6 per unit. Apart from that, despite the erratic power supply, the units are being forced to pay standing electricity charges every month, which amounts roughly to 25% of their bills. “The government could have provided the units some financial relief by waiving the standing charges. If they can give everything to farmers for free, why they can’t do that with the MSMEs?” JSIA president Philip Mathew said. DVC has curtailed its daily power supply to the state by 50% since November last year after citing that the state failed to come up with a set pattern of repayment, which led to the dues piling up to Rs 2,173 crore. A fortnight ago, the state government had urged the DVC to halt its power-cuts for the interim owing to the Covid-19 situation, but it was all in vain.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/state-msmes-to-seek-centres-intervention-to-end-power-crisis/articleshow/89081812.cms||Dhritiman Ray

According to data, Palamu has 4,670 TB patients but many are said to be drug resistant. State tuberculosis officer Dr Ranjit Prasad said the state government has launched MERM box in treatment of drug resistant TB patients in only six districts, including Palamu, under a pilot project. “MERM box is a sort of aiding device to remind and monitor TB patient warning him/her not to be casual with the medication as any laxity may lead to severe consequences,” he said. Earlier, 99 DOT (directly observed therapy) procedure was used for TB treatment. Palamu district TB officer Dr Vijay Kumar Singh said that the newly designed modular electronic monitor device also enables officials to keep tabs on TB patients in regard to their daily medication. The MERM box has advanced electronic device with three colour blinks — green, yellow and red. One card box of MERM contains one month’s TB medicines. Green suggests patient is ready to eat the medicines. Yellow light is the reminder to refill the MERM box. Red is for battery. The battery can be recharged at any of the government health hub. He said, “It has been noticed that TB patients after two or three months of the medication become unmindful of the disease and discontinue medication. As a result, they tend to become drug resistant.” Asked if a poor TB patient needs a smart phone for this, he said, “It is not mandatory. All that we need is strict adherence to medicines."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/health-dept-provides-10-monitoring-devices-for-tb-patients-in-palamu/articleshow/89081813.cms||---

An infection of a fully vaccinated person is referred to as ‘vaccine breakthrough infection,’ which shows that the vaccine is not 100% effective in preventing infections. “In case of virus like Covid-19 that mutates very fast, there remains a possibility of variants like Omicron causing breakthrough infections. Vaccines are not 100% effective in prevention but they definitely helped in reducing severity and fatalities this time,” MGMMC Dean Dr Sanjay Dixit said. Of these 23,442 Covid cases, 1662 were non-vaccinated including 1209 children aged below 15 years, as per health department records. The sero-survey (phase one) conducted among children below 18 years found the majority being infected naturally implying that the virus was breaking the shield/ wall of antibodies generated in both cases---- naturally and through vaccination. The age-wise bifurcation of infections showed that around half of the cases were in the working population age group of 21-40. As many as 11690 people aged 21-40 were infected in the district while 6110 infected ones were in the 41-60 age group.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/indore/92-indore-cases-in-the-third-wave-are-breakthrough-infections/articleshow/89081817.cms||Antriksh Singh

MGM dean Dr Sanjay Dixit on this trend told TOI, “The decrease in hospitalisation rate or very low number of persons being hospitalised is a trend witnessed in the district on the expected lines.” “Different studies, data, figures from across the globe of this disease caused because of Omicron implies a very low rate of hospitalisation due to less severity”, said Dr Dixit. It is happening because of a very huge number of cases being detected in asymptomatic patients in the district. This trend is equally true for state as well as country in the third wave, said Dr Dixit.Dr Dixit added, “In the next ten days ie by the end of this month, we are expecting a peak of the third wave going by the trend of metro cities like Mumbai and Delhi.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/indore/rate-of-hospitalisation-drops-below-1-lowest-in-pandemic/articleshow/89081819.cms||Antriksh Singh

These faculty members include senior faculty including professors, head of the departments, consultant involved in patients treatment, strategy formation for preventing the spread of Covid-19. The MPMSU issued directions to eligible faculty members of medical colleges as it failed to fix an agency for online evaluation of answer books in the last six months. The agency enganged earlier was debarred after allegations of fraud. MP Medical Teachers Association Secretary Dr Ashok Thakur said, “MPMSU is trying to implement the system of school at university level. The decision to ask faculty members to come to Jabalpur for evaluation of answer books will put them at exposure risk of Covid-19.” “The works of medical colleges including the clinical ones will suffer because of this decision. In case, a faculty tests positive, he will lose seven working days due to isolation/hospitalisation during recovery”, said Dr Thakur. “We have written a letter to MPMSU demanding change in this decision”, added Dr Thakur. “The university could transport the copies to medical colleges for evaluation after coding them as done earlier”, added Dr Thakur. MPMSU registrar Dr Prabahat Kumar Budholia passed the buck and said, “I don’t have the decision-making power. The decision is taken by the VC or the executive committee.” “I am only responsible for implementation of any decision taken. As far as this decision is concerned, it has been taken after due consideration of the current situation”, said Dr Budholia. “The decision is taken as the university is trying to complete the examination process as soon as possible”, added Budholia.

There are over 1200 higher educational institutions across the state. However, as per the data available on the official NAAC website, only 71 colleges are accredited with the agency. Of the total accredited, over 35 colleges have been accredited with C grade, which is considered the lowest in the NAAC grading system. While over 20 colleges have B g grade – second lowest rating in the grading table, 8 colleges have B+ grade and one college each with B++ grade, A grade, A+ grade and A++ grade. Whereas out of the 35 universities in the state only five are NAAC accredited Devi Ahilya Vishwavidyalaya (DAVV) being the only state university with an A+ grade. Whereas as per the data of Higher Education department, 104 government colleges are accredited of which 35 colleges have C grade, 39 have B grade, as many as 13 colleges have B+, nine colleges have B++, seven colleges are A and one college is A+. Higher Education Commissioner, Deepak Singh said that the department has been working on getting more colleges accredited. “For academic session 2021-22, 55 Government colleges have been zeroed down of which six have already received NAAC status whereas for academic session 2022-23, 75 colleges are shortlisted,” he added. Majority of the colleges affiliated to DAVV also don’t have NAAC grade. As per some of the senior professors the colleges are reluctant to opt for NAAC assessment owing to poor facilities and sub-standard quality of education they have been imparting. Therefore, Colleges don’t opt for assessment by NAAC fearing the poor grades and ranking which might further affect their admissions. Of 239 affiliated colleges, over 200 colleges aren’t accredited. Technically, encouraging the institute to get NAAC accreditation is the responsibility of College Development Cell (CDC), the varsity isn’t directly responsible. However, DAVV is ready to handhold and assist affiliated colleges for their grades from NAAC, director of DAVV’s IQAC, Dr Pratosh Bansal told TOI. As per the varsity officials, accreditation from NAAC would also make colleges eligible for grants under Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA).

The state government is planning on rolling out the NEP from the 2022-23 academic year. DPI officials said that the survey being undertaken among the teachers was part of a nation-wide exercise.Teachers said that their opinion was being sought so as to help the DPI come up with a comprehensive plan on improving learning outcome. “The officials want to learn if peer teaching can be introduced. We have been asked to share our experience on various aspects including school infrastructure, and its impact on learning,” a teacher said.Retired IAS officer Madan Gopal, who is heading the task force on the implementation of NEP-2020 in Karnataka, pointed out that teachers were the key stakeholders in the education sector. “Their opinion is crucial for us for framing guidelines.

---||India||Hindu, Hinduism and Hindutva, as understood by Supreme Court||Three days back, Congress primo uomo leader Rahul Gandhi, continuing with his attack on Hindutvavadis perceiving them as communal, tweeted “‘Hindutvavadis’ have been spreading hatred in the cyber world because cowards only attack while hiding. Had they mustered enough courage, they would have come forward. We need to be strong and keep tackling this hatred — the country needs to be saved!” Who is a Hindutvavadi? The simple answer is one who follows, practices and professes Hindutva. To understand Hindutva, one probably needs to delve into ‘Hindu’ and ‘Hinduism’ and the safest place to venture in this issue is the Supreme Court which in its annals has a vast interpretative jurisprudential reservoir on these three words — Hindu, Hinduism and Hindutva. One of India’s greatest educationists and its first Vice-President S Radhakrishnan in his book ‘The Hindu View of Life’ defined Hindus thus—“The people on the Indian side of the Sindhu were called Hindu by the Persian and the later western invaders... That is the genesis of the word “Hindu”. When we think of the Hindu religion. We find it difficult, if not impossible, to define Hindu religion or even adequately describe it... It may broadly be described as a way of life and nothing more.” On Hinduism, celebrated British academician and historian Monier Williams in his book, ‘Religious Thought and Life in India’, has observed that “it must be borne in mind that Hinduism is far more than a mere form of theism resting on Brahmanism. It presents for our investigation a complex congeries of creeds and doctrines which is its gradual accumulation may be compared to the gathering together of the mighty volume of the Ganges, swollen by a continual influx of tributary rivers and rivulets, .... The Hindu religion is a reflection of the composite character of the Hindus, who are not one people but many. It is based on the idea of universal receptivity. It has ever aimed at accommodating itself to circumstances, and has carried on the process of adaptation through more than three thousand years.” The first reference to ‘Hindutva’ was recorded by the Supreme Court in its judgment [1994 (6) SCC 360] in the case ‘Ismail Faruqi’, who had challenged the validity of the 1993 central law acquiring the disputed area in Ayodhya and large tracts of land around it. Justice S P Bharucha, who was part of the three judge bench which upheld the acquisition, said, “Ordinarily, Hindutva is understood as a way of life or a state of mind and it is not to be equated with, or understood as religious Hindu fundamentalism.” The nascent interpretation of ‘Hindutva’ as ‘a way of life’ by Justice Bharucha in Ismail Faruqi, engaged deeper scrutiny analysis at the hands of a three-judge bench headed by renowned Justice J S Verma in Ramesh Yeshwant Prabhoo vs Shri Prabhakar Kashinath Kunte [1996 SCC (1) 130]. The case witnessed a see-saw battle between two heavyweights— Ram Jethmalani for Shiv Sena and Ashok Desai for the opposite side, both quoting scriptures and historians liberally. Justice Verma relied on numerous past constitution bench judgments and said those decisions “indicate that no precise meaning can be ascribed to the terms ‘Hindu’, ‘Hindutva’ and ‘Hinduism’; and no meaning in the abstract can confine it to the narrow limits of religion alone, excluding the content of Indian culture and heritage. It is also indicated that the term ‘Hindutva’ is related more to the way of life of the people in the sub- continent. It is difficult to appreciate how in the face of these decisions the term ‘Hindutva’ or ‘Hinduism’ per se, in the abstract, can be assumed to mean and be equated with narrow fundamentalist Hindu religious bigotry...”. The SC ruled that mere use of the word ‘Hindutva’ or ‘Hinduism’ or mention of any other religion in an election speech does not bring it within the net of sub-section (3) and/or sub-section (3A) of Section 123, (to constitute corrupt practices which could disqualify the candidate) unless the further elements indicated are also present in that speech. The SC also dispelled the notion, being given currency by politicians of different creeds, that terms’Hinduism’ or ‘Hindutva’ per se cannot be construed to depict hostility, enmity or intolerance towards other religious faiths or professing communalism. Such an apprehension, the SC said, proceeded from an improper appreciation and perception of the true meaning of these expressions emerging from the detailed discussion in earlier authorities of this Court. However, the court had warned against possible politically beneficial misuse of the terms and advised strong measures to curb such tendencies. “Misuse of these expressions to promote communalism cannot alter the true meaning of these terms. The mischief resulting from the misuse of the terms by anyone in his speech has to be checked and not its permissible use. It is indeed very unfortunate, if in spite of the liberal and tolerant features of ‘Hinduism’ recognised in judicial decisions, these terms are misused by anyone during the elections to gain any unfair political advantage. Fundamentalism of any colour or kind must be curbed with a heavy hand to preserve and promote the secular creed of the nation. Any misuse of these terms must, therefore, be dealt with strictly.” Would giving a narrow meaning to Hindu, Hinduism and Hindutva, which is akin to trying a blunt political scissor on an ocean-sized fabric to suit a narrower political agenda, cut ice with the electorate? Results will tell us in March.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hindu-hinduism-and-hindutva-as-understood-by-supreme-court/articleshow/89081806.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Addressed to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, among others, the petition states that in-person learning should now resume to give children a chance to get the educational environment that they deserve. “There is evidence to show that schools have not been the main driver of Covid transmission in communities. The fact that malls, markets, restaurants and cinemas are open at 50% capacity and schools are shut does not make sense. Is it correct to put economics and entertainment ahead of the mental well-being of our future generation?” it stated. A lack of social interaction was also leading to psychological problems among children with cases of depression and anxiety being recorded, the petition argued. “Physical activity in school is essential for all-round and physical development. Keeping children at home will result in disturbances in all these areas,” the petition stated. While online education is affecting the development of hand and motor skills, the petition also stated that children with mental and/or physical disabilities are suffering due to the online mode of teaching-learning. Stating that the Maharashtra government had already announced resumption of offline classes from January 24, the petition added, “Covid is not likely to disappear anytime soon and we have to move on and deal with it as best as possible. We must allow children to have a normal school. Reducing the syllabus and changing exam patterns to make them simpler to suit the online mode will put children at a disadvantage in senior classes and at the college level.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/online-petition-calls-for-physical-classes-to-resume/articleshow/89080745.cms||---

District health officer Dr Dhananjay said that since the vaccination rate is high, the rate of hospitalisation is as low as 4 per cent. ‘Out of 5,594 active cases, total 4,941patients, including 291 children, are in home isolation. In all, 7,162 home isolation kits were distributed,” he said. Asha and Anganwadi workers distribute the kits.“Since, a large number of patients are asymptotic and don’t need to be hospitalised, the Covid kits would help patients recover at home without paying a single penny for medicines,” Dhananjay said.“As of Sunday, only 98 patients are hospitalised and the hospitalisation rate is far below of 4 per cent. In the third wave, five deaths were reported, of which three were unvaccinated patients. The greater disproportion in the total number of infection and hospitalisation numbers is clearly showing how vaccination is obviously playing a vital role in preventing serious disease,” Dhananjay said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/covid-patients-in-mandya-get-home-isolation-kits/articleshow/89081834.cms||---

With as many as 93 teachers from the district testing positive in last five days, many elderly teachers are hesitating to attend physical classes. Schools across the state reopened after Sankranti celebrations on January 17. Despite the sudden spurt in Covid-19 cases, the education department passed orders to conduct physical classes. As many as 63 per cent of students attended classes on the first day of reopening in the district. The education department expressed satisfaction over the attendance of the students and directed headmasters and mandal education officers (MEOs) to take measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19. However, after 40 teachers in various municipal schools in Vijayawada tested positive, officials are struggling to arrange physical classes due to staff shortage. Municipal teachers have urged Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) authorities to grant permission to run online classes as many students attending physical classes are sick and at risk of Covid-19. The number of Covid-19 cases has also increased after teachers attended PRC protests at the collector’s office in Machilipatnam. Attendance is gradually reducing as many parents are hesitating to send children to schools. Around 70% of private schools across district have resumed online classes.

In a letter to Gehlot, Poonia said over 1.35 lakh farmers are under the threat of losing their land to auction for not being able to pay loan to banks. “Reports say that banks have declared bank accounts of these farmers as non-performing assets and filed a case against them under the removal of difficulties Act,” said Poonia in the letter. Further quoting the report, he said the total outstanding amount pending on these farmers is Rs 2,928 crore. “Of total 1,35 lakh bank accounts, 80,000 of them are just a year old. The state did ask its banks to go for one-time settlement, but at the same time they have initiated the process of auctioning the land of 9,000 farmers,” said Poonia. He concluded the letter by reminding Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s promise of loan waiver of farmers during the assembly polls in 2018. “The state should fulfil the promise made by them and should not pass the buck on the central government,” said Poonia. Poonia in another letter to the CM demanded a CBI probe into the REET scandal. He said lakhs of students have appeared in the exam and they’re feeling cheated as the government has allowed the paper to be leaked. “Since the arrest of the prime accused Bhatti Lal Meena and Mukesh, the investigation is pointing towards government officials involved in the racket. Investigation agency SOG has not been able to arrest the real culprits,” said Poonia.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/gehlot-shouldnt-ask-centre-for-farm-loan-waiver-poonia/articleshow/89081859.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Feel pity for Oppn & RSS for concocting stories: CM||Jaipur: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Sunday said the RSS and BJP were suffering from guilt consciousness for not being able to contribute anything in the freedom struggle.Gehlot made the remark while addressing a virtual programme to mark the 125th birth anniversary of Subhas Chandra Bose. Accusing the RSS of spreading fake stories about differences between Netaji and Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, Gehlot, said, “If you study history, you will know that great leaders of that period had differences, but they never discriminated against each other. Their stories are a source of inspiration for the present generation. I feel pity for the opposition and the RSS for concocting stories.” Stating that Bose and Nehru shared cordial relations, Gehlot said when Nehru was in prison, his wife Kamla Nehru fell ill and was taken care of by Netaji. “Netaji took her to Germany for treatment of TB. He was with Kamla Nehru until Jawaharlal Nehru came out of the prison. Nehru had always stayed at Netaji’s residence even after the latter formed his own party,” said Gehlot. Taking a dig at PM Narendra Modi decision to install the statue of Netaji at India Gate, Gehlot said it is merely an attempt to show off. “Installing Netaji’s statue will not help. What was the ideology of Netaji? It is similar to Congress belief in democracy, constitution, secularism, Hindu-Muslim unity. Netaji was a supporter of all these principles,” said Gehlot. Further sharpening his attack, Gehlot said none of them (RSS) went to jail for freedom struggle. “When the country was fighting the British, it is said that Veer Savarkar had joined them. They never accepted Gandhiji and you see that their men worship Nathuram Godse. They don’t know history. Only thing they know is distorted history. All their decisions like removal of flame from Amar Jawan Jyoti is an attempt to erase the history of 70 years of country’s achievement,” said Gehlot. Blaming the present dispensation for tension and violence in the country, Gehlot said it feels that constitution is under threat at present.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/feel-pity-for-oppn-rss-for-concocting-stories-cm/articleshow/89081862.cms||---

Three cases of thefts at wedding venues in Kardhani, Vaishali Nagar and Bhankrota areas have been reported in the last three days. The first case was filed at Kardhani police station on Friday wherein Rs 1. 35 lakh and gold jewellery kept inside a purse were stolen from a wedding garden. According to the FIR, the incident took place when a woman had come to attend a pre-wedding function of her relative.

The second case was filed at the Bhankrota police station on Friday where a man alleged he had gone to a wedding venue located on Sirsi Road to attend his daughter’s wedding function on Thursday. About 9.35pm, unidentified thieves decamped with a handbag that had Rs 2.5 lakh in it. The man told cops that he was busy in the celebrations when the thieves struck and fled with the handbag.

---||Jaipur||Govt push for affordable housing scheme in Rajasthan||JAIPUR: The state government has given relaxation to the developers constructing affordable houses under the public private partnership (PPP) mode in the state. The decision was taken after the pace to construct affordable houses including economic weaker section (EWS) and lower income group (LIG) slowed down due to existing policies, which became a hindrance in achieving a target of 4,200 houses. Along with providing setback relaxation to construct multi-storied affordable houses on private land, the government has also provided relaxation in granting approvals. An official said, “For a building having height up to 45 meters, the developers will be provided 6 metre setback. For this, there will not be any requirement to seek approval of the state government. Similarly, the urban improvement trusts (UITs) and development authorities (DAs) can provide a height clearance up to 30 meters and 40 meters respectively, at its level without seeking higher approval.” On May 31, 2017, an order was issued in this regard. In this, registered architects were authorised to approve the projects. However, on July 17, 2018 an order was also issued in which UITs and DAs were given rights to provide height clearances, instead of architects due to which process was stalled. “Now, in recent order issued the project approved between 2017 and 2018 by the architects will not require the state government’s permission again,” said an official. The state government plans to complete the construction work after taking loan from the Housing and Urban Development Corporation Ltd (HUDCO). “After the successful allottees of Chief Minister Jan Awas Yojana and affordable housing scheme failed to deposit instalments during the pandemic the many projects are stalled. The projects will be completed after taking the loan.” The department will take a loan of Rs 200 crore to complete these projects. While Rs 160 crore will be spent to construct the pending 19,244 houses under Jan Awas Yojana, Rs 40 crore will be spent for constructing 4,112 affordable houses.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/govt-push-for-affordable-housing-scheme-in-raj/articleshow/89081873.cms||---

There’s a huge dip in families completing 100 days of employment over last year (2020-21), when more than 12 lakh families had completed it. Over 5 lakh families have completed 71-80 days of NREGA work already. Suspension of NREGA work in May and June last year (2021) had resulted in people not being able to meet the target of 100 days of employment. On Sunday, labour engagement under the employment guarantee scheme was 24.80 lakh in the state. “Currently, there is a huge demand for NREGA work in rural areas. The increase in demand now is also because of suspension of NREGA work in the state in May and June last year due to the second Covid wave,” said Arvind Saxena, superintendent engineer, employment guarantee scheme (EGS).“The demand of around 5-6 lakh workers, who couldn’t work in May and June, is getting captured now. Earlier, during this period of the year, around 22-23 lakh workers used to demand for work but it has increased by 5-6 lakh workers this year. Moreover, there is a yearning to complete 100 days of employment under the scheme,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/mgnrega-3-6l-families-complete-100-day-work/articleshow/89081874.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Most Egyptian vultures in Rajasthan from Uzbekistan||JAIPUR: After studying migratory birds’ path, wildlife researchers have revealed that majority of population of Egyptian vultures coming to Jorbeer in Rajasthan and other parts of the country during winters come from Uzbekistan and other Central Asia countries. Earlier, it was believed that the maximum population of Egyptian vultures found inside the country are residents and do not migrate from other countries. However, after following the path of three birds tagged by the Bulgarian Society For Protection of Birds, it was learnt that the majority of the Egyptian vultures have migrated. Senior wildlife researcher and member of Raptors Research Foundation, Dau Lal Bohara said, “Although Egyptian vultures are not truly migratory. they do travel between resident and breeding areas to a greater extent than do most other vultures. The population of Egyptian vultures in Jorbeer was recorded at 2,600. Once these birds left to other places in the country, the number was reduced to 700.” Researchers informed the three Egyptian vultures — Anya, Arys and Timur —, which had undergone their first autumn migrations, were tagged in Uzbekistan. Out of three tagged birds, two came to Rajasthan. All three birds initially flew south over Turkmenistan before taking very different routes. Timur covered more than 3,800 miles (6200km), passing through Iran, Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia before settling in Yemen. This bird did not come to India. However, Anya crossed onto Iran and flew over Afghanistan, Pakistan before coming to Jorbeer after covering a distance of 1400 miles (2300km). She also visited areas including west of Shiv and Barmer since her arrival. Similarly, Arya travelled approximately 930 miles (1500km), Afghanistan and Pakistan before also settling in Rajasthan. He crossed the border into Rajasthan/India on 18 September 2021, to reach Bhadriya (60 km east of Jaisalmer). Vladimir Dobrev (Bulgaria), who is associated with the project said, this work was carried out within the framework of the OSME, Oriental Bird Club and Hawk Conservancy Trust Program to study migration routes and wintering sites for vultures nesting in Uzbekistan. “These birds were tagged in Kyzylkum Desert. The population in Uzbekistan is 135 pairs. Studying migration routes is one of the most important tasks in identifying threats to our vultures.” Despite the site being of international importance, Rajasthan was not included in the Centre’s action plan for Vulture Conservation in India (2020-2025). Danveer Singh, a bird watcher said, “The birds of prey in Jorbeer, the preferred vulture habitat, are alarmingly falling prey to two medicines, Aceclofenac and ketoprofen administered by veterinarians in cattle. Moreover, mortality continuously occurs due to electrocution. A conservation plan for this site should be prepared,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/most-egyptian-vultures-in-raj-from-uzbekistan/articleshow/89081876.cms||---

In the garment industry, lakhs of people are employed. If the garment industry suffers, the revenues from yarn cannot compensate for the loss as it has limited value addition,” said Shah.He said that the domestic exporters are facing difficulties in converting queries into orders as they cannot match the price countries like Bangladesh offer.“We cannot offer the rate for orders that other countries are giving. We will have no margin given the rise in fabric prices,” added Shah.While cotton prices have escalated owing to supply constraints, hoarding by traders and speculation in the commodities markets have further raised the rates. Even the spinning mills have become the biggest gainers in the value chain.Garment manufacturers who are catering to the domestic market as well, have been impacted due to Covid lockdowns. In the past, the organized retailers, who sourced from the manufacturers, did not pay for 6-12 months.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/garment-exporters-lose-orders-for-sharp-rise-in-fabric-prices/articleshow/89081877.cms||---

While the leg-spinner left many cricket experts ‘very impressed’, some termed him a ‘wizard’. But even before the entire cricket fraternity took notice of him at the world stage during the junior event in January 2020, IPL scouts had their eyes set on Bishnoi’s raw talent. What followed next - a bidding war in December 2019 at the 2020 IPL auction table between Mumbai Indians and Punjab Kings, before the latter snapped the youngster for Rs 2 crore against his base price of Rs 20 lakh.Things are bigger and better in 2022 for Bishnoi who is also on the national selectors’ radar. At Rs 4 crore, the new IPL franchise from Lucknow has named the young spinner in its three draft picks. Ecstatic at the opportunity, while Bishnoi expressed his gratitude for the continuous support of his two coaches Shahrukh Pathan and Pradyot Singh Rathore, he was quick to mention Lucknow captain KL Rahul being a factor in the interest shown in him by the new franchise from the north. “It’s a proud moment for me, my coaches and family as I am one of those few players among the world’s best picked by the franchise before the mega auction. Aur mereko lagta hain Rahul bhai ne bola hoga mere liye (I have a feeling Rahul must have suggested my name to the Lucknow franchise management). Now my focus is on doing even better for my new IPL team and helping them win games,” said Bishnoi who has taken 24 wickets at an economy of 6.96 in 23 IPL matches so far.Strong support system: Having already played under Rahul during his time with Punjab, the leggie with a deceptive googly credits the backing he received there for boosting his confidence. “I was given an opportunity to play in the very first season I was picked by the Punjab Kings (PBKS) in 2020. Throughout my two-year stint with them, I have received immense backing both from captain Rahul bhai and Anil Kumble sir (the director of cricket operations for PBKS). It was a big exposure for me as a youngster and it added to my confidence as a bowler,” acknowledged the youngster. Talking about hard work, Bishnoi feels he has been lucky to have a strong support system around him. “No matter what the situation, Sharukh and Pradyot bhaiya have always stood by me. I can’t thank them enough for the way they ensured I did not miss out on my training when everything was shut during the two lockdowns because of Covid-19. There was hardly any movement allowed as Jodhpur was a red zone for a pretty long time. I took my essentials and camped at the Spartans Cricket Academy in Jodhpur which is run by these two coaches. Not even for a single day I had to miss out on my practice. I feel I am very lucky. My effort to improve needed their support,” he said.Highest earning family member: At 21, Bishnoi is the highest earning member in his family, but he does not wish to dwell over his growing bank balance. “Money matters, but it is more important for any young player to get an opportunity to play at this level and showcase his skill. Paisa baad main bhi kamaya jaa sakta hain (money can be earned later as well),” he said. Not looking beyond the immediate opportunity at hand, Bishnoi said,“I do not wish to clutter my thinking about the upcoming T20 World Cup selection. The opportunity in front of me is to play for Lucknow and that is my focus at present. Doing well here will to a lot of extent play a role in what happens next.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/feels-great-to-be-one-of-those-few-players-picked-before-mega-auction-bishnoi/articleshow/89081886.cms||---

Thanking Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union minister of state for chemicals and fertilisers Bhagwanth Khuba, and chief minister Basavaraj Bommai, Dakshina Kannada MP Nalin Kumar Kateel said the Plastic Park coming up on 104 acres will help in generating employment.The park for Mangaluru was announced when Ananth Kumar was the minister of chemicals and fertilisers in 2015. As a minister, D V Sadananda Gowda had given in-principle approval for the Plastic Park in January 2021, and had directed the department of commerce and industry of Karnataka to submit a detailed project report on the same. Under-secretary to government of India, Dharam Vir, said in a letter to N Shivashankara, CEO, KIADB, that the central grant for the project is subject to compliance with the guidelines issued by the department of chemicals and petrochemicals. “KIADB, being the key promoter for this project, will facilitate the project implementation, and guarantee financial closure for the project within one year of final approval. The SPV will complete the setting up of the Plastic Park within the time-frame provided in the scheme guidelines, unless extension has been accorded by the department of chemicals and petrochemicals. In case the project is not started within a responsible period of time from the date of sanction, the scheme steering committee may withdraw the sanction, so that the limited resources available under the scheme could be re-allocated to other deserving projects,” Vir stated.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/at-ganjimutt-plastic-park-project-gets-final-approval/articleshow/89081892.cms||---

The disrespect has hurt the sentiments of the people.”AICC secretary Ivan D’Souza said, “The issue was triggered only because of an error on the part of the central government. However, BJP leaders are spreading lies to justify the central government’s mistake.”VHP divisional secretary Sharan Pumpwell said that the procession for Narayana Guru has the outfit’s support.

---||Mangaluru||Cong, Left trying to divide society: Min||Mangaluru: Energy, Kannada and culture minister V Sunil Kumar said Congress leaders in Karnataka, including former chief minister Siddaramaiah, and the Left parties are trying to divide society through the Sri Narayana Guru tableau issue.“The Left party government in Kerala has violated the guidelines while preparing a float for the Republic Day parade. They have intentionally created issues to insult Sri Narayana Guru and Hindu society. The central government’s committee on Republic Day celebrations has already rejected the floats of states that violated the guidelines. The Communist government in Kerala wanted to create confusion through the tableau,” the minister shared his thoughts on social media.“The Kerala government has been spreading misinformation that only the tableau on Sri Narayana Guru was rejected. In fact, the committee has opposed three tableau proposals sent by Kerala including Shankaracharya, Jatayu and Sri Narayana Guru,” he said, adding Congress leaders in Karnataka are trying to make it a political issue.“We have seen how Congress divided Veerashaiva and Lingayat sects for political gains. They tried to divide society through the Shaadi Bhagya scheme. Now it is trying to divide the society through Sri Narayana Guru’s tableau issue. While Sri Narayana Guru upheld the principles of unity, the Communist and Congress parties are keen on dividing society,” the minister said.On various organisations’ plans of holding rallies with Sri Narayana Guru’s portraits on Republic Day, Kumar said he welcomes the decision. “As a devotee of Sri Narayana Guru, I will also be part of such programmes. We will extend our support for such programmes. People should understand the political ploy of Communist and Congress parties planned through the issue. It was the same Congress that raised objections when Mangaluru City Corporation (MCC) mooted a proposal to name Lady Hill Circle after Sri Narayana Guru,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/cong-left-trying-to-divide-society-min/articleshow/89081894.cms||---

It is marked as a de-containment zone after a week if no positive cases are found. During the second wave, many higher education institutions had turned as containment zones.Ashok said that the health department had noticed that some institutions with Covid-19 cases on campus shut down the facility without bringing it to the notice of officials. “We have taken them to task. A few days ago, a college near Kodialbail shifted to online classes after the campus reported more than five Covid-19 cases. It was not brought to the notice of the health department,” he said. He said the institutions must inform the department.“As of now, the majority of the containment zones are college hostels followed by schools. If the health department finds a hostel where inmates from various colleges are infected with Covid-19, we declare the hostel a containment zone instead of their schools or colleges. For example: BCM hostels. Similarly, we have asked the department of public instruction to suspend on-campus classes if there is a cluster in a particular class,” Ashok said.The development of educational institutions being declared into containment zones started around mid-December with paramedical and nursing colleges. “Currently, all sorts of educational institutions have been declared containment zones…. Most of the students have mild symptoms or are asymptomatic,” Ashok said.A senior professor added that the majority of the student population in Dakshina Kannada have Covid-19 symptoms. “The problem is that they are unwilling to get tested,” said the professor who recovered from Covid-19 a few days ago.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/campuses-become-containment-zones/articleshow/89081895.cms||---

The officer pointed out that three doctors and nine nurses who tested positive for Covid are undergoing the mandatory quarantine period. Dr Mahale further said, “While some employees have been infected with the Covid, there are a few others who have joined their duties after the quarantine period. The staffers are testing positive for the infection gradually.” Overall, 4 doctors and 21 nurses have contracted Covid in the past 15 days. “The most important thing is that none of them was hospitalized, and they were either under institutional quarantine or in the home isolation. So far, 13 staffers have been discharged,” said the officer. While the nurses are from the nurses training institute, the institutional quarantine facility has been created on their college premises itself and the treatment, if and when required, is being provided to them. “Since the people have tested positive in a phased manner, not all of them are off the duty at the same time. Secondly, the number of patients in the hospital is also less and hence, the situation is currently manageable with the available staff,” he said. The 50-bed Covid section of the hospital has 26 admissions which were less than 12 three days back. All of these admissions were from the rural areas, including Satana, Malegaon, Chandwad, Nandgaon and Malegaon. The staff is capable of handling the situation, as none of the patients is critical, the officer said, adding that all those infected could be picking up their duties in the next five days. “In a way, these people would be ready to take care if the cases go up for any reason in the near future,” Dr Mahale added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/3-doctors-9-nurses-at-malegaon-general-hospital-test-covid-positive/articleshow/89081905.cms||---

On land too, nets used for fencing farms and properties are leaving a distressing trail of trapped wildlife, and their count is only increasing over the years. Animal rescues usually involve retrieving snakes and other wildlife from homes and settlement areas. But of late, volunteers are finding wildlife trapped in nets – dead, suffocated or badly injured. “It is disappointing to note that such cases are on the rise. Quite often we receive calls after the wildlife is dead from hours of torture,” Johnson Stephen, an animal rescuer said. In a shocking case, a property fenced with a net at Usgao – rich in herpetofaunal (reptiles and amphibians) diversity - turned into a death trap for the local snake population. “After neighbours informed us, we were saddened to find 22 snakes stuck in the net, 16 of them dead and mostly reduced to skeletons. Only six, two pythons, rat snakes and Russell’s vipers were rescued,” Charan Desai of animal rescue squad (ARS) said. The voluntary organisation with rescuers all over Goa rescued and released more than 4,000 snakes during 2021. “Out of this total, 64 snakes were entangled in ghosts nets, eight were injured and 24 dead,” Desai said. A delay in contacting rescuers due to various reasons often proves fatal for the reptiles. “A rat snake paid with its life in a net meant to protect the vegetable crop in Chorao as the farmer took some time to get our number,” Harish Chari, an animal rescuer said. Often people panic out of fear of snakes and either avoid attempting a rescue or call rescuers late. “Sometimes they cut the part of net after the reptile dies to avoid foul smell,” Stephen said. Many find nets convenient for to fence compounds or to protect crops from reptiles and field rodents. Even village boys use nets along roadside or water bodies to keep the ball inside play area. “We rescued two snakes entangled in nets put by boys at Pilar and Caranzalem,” Chari said. Rats nibble their way through but reptiles try to wriggle out in vain and end up with severe injuries and dehydration. The trapped wildlife is often noticed after it has gone through hours of pain and agony. “In 90% cases, it is snakes who crawl into the nets and it is difficult for them to survive in tough nylon nets. We found a large cobra dead in a farmer’s fence at Old Goa,” Chari said. A few other animals get caught in nets on rare occasions. Animal rescuer, Benhail Antao recently rescued a porcupine and pangolin in South Goa, while ARS set free a civet cat and a baby crocodile as well as a crocodile during monsoon floods. Animal rescuers are critical about usage of nets for fencing as it is lethally impacting herpetofaunal diversity. “These nets are hardly effective while hard plastic nets which are available at hardware shops would be more suitable,” Desai said. Alternatives which are harmless to reptiles and other animals are favoured by wildlifers. “Creating awareness about the issue is important, and material without meshes or cloth type could be used to protect animals from harm,” Chari said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/farm-fences-maiming-killing-reptiles-wildlifers/articleshow/89101334.cms||Paul Fernandes

---||Delhi||Delhi: Probe points to Hamas link to crypto hack||NEW DELHI: A five-month-long investigation by the Intelligence Fusion & Strategic Ops (IFSO) unit of Delhi Police’s Special Cell into hacking of a crypto-currency wallet has revealed that Palestinian militant outfit Hamas was behind the crime, sources say. Read AlsoHow Israel’s intel helped Delhi cops crack crypto hacking caseCommunication from a foreign intelligence agency to the Indian intelligence flagging crypto wallets being operated by al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, led Delhi Police to crack a one-of-its-kind crypto hacking case. Hamas is known to be using cryptocurrencies, which are comparatively Delhi Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana is likely to communicate the developments to the authorities concerned at home and abroad through theappropriate channels. According to a confidential investigation report prepared by DCP (IFSO) KPS Malhotra, the cryptocurrencies, whose value as of today stands at Rs 4 crore, were stolen from a west Delhi businessman’s wallet. They were routed through various private wallets before finally landing up with those being used and operated in Gaza by al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas that is globally known for using stolen and donated crypto-currency for terror financing. The incident was reported in 2019 after a Paschim Vihar-based businessman lodged a complaint with the local police after losing access to his wallet. According to the complaint, the victim owned 6.2 Bitcoin, 9.79 Etherum, 2.44 Bitcoin cash of blockchain mobile wallet on his Oppo F17 mobile device. The approximate value of his currency at that time was around Rs 30.6 lakh, sources said. The case was transferred to Special Cell for technical investigation. Malhotra then formed a special team comprising ACP Raman Lamba, SI Neeraj and others to track the recipients of the siphoned off money. The details of his crypto wallet, along with other accounts, were found to have been uploaded on the Darknet. Initial probe using a series of tracer tools revealed that the victim’s device was hacked and currency was transferred into three different accounts without his consent and knowledge. During the course of investigation, the cryptocurrency trail led police to identify accounts that were maintained by al-Qassam Brigades, apart from wallets seized by Israel’s defense ministry’s National Bureau for Counter Terror Financing. The seizure of the digital wallets linked to Hamas were termed by Israel as the first and most aggressive action against the terror group’s crypto-currency efforts. “The seized wallet belonged to Mohammad Naseer Ibrahim Abdulla. The other wallets in which a major share of the cryptocurrencies were transferred were being operated from Giza in Egypt. One such wallet belonged to Ahmed Marzooq. Another wallet, in which cryptocurrencies had been transferred, belonged to Ahmed QH Safi from Ramallah in Palestine,” the report filed by IFSO stated. Some of the stolen currency was also found transferred to a UK-based gambling site and a child pornography site, said sources. The development comes amid calls of regulation and crackdown on digital wallets, long favoured by cybercriminals for laundering funds gathered via digital crimes. At present, there is currently no law in India that regulates cryptocurrency trading. However, trading of and setting up a cryptocurrency exchange is legal in India. Cryptocurrency is a form of digital currency that can be termed as a collection of data designed to be anonymous and secure. The virtual currency is designed to work as a medium of exchange using cryptography to secure transactions and to control the creation of additional units of currency. No single entity owns or controls them and it works on a peer-to-peer system. They are comparatively difficult to trace and offer some anonymity online.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/probe-points-to-hamas-link-to-crypto-hack/articleshow/89080788.cms||Raj Shekhar

The Nashik district has 7.94 lakh people who are overdue for the second vaccine dose — mostly Covishield which has a gap of 84 days between two shots. There is also a small number of people who are up for the second Covaxin dose. Nashik Zilla Parishad’s Dr Kailas Bhoye, who is in charge of vaccination in the district, said the number of people who have are due for the second vaccine dose is very high, and though the administration has been appealing to them to take the dose, many of them are not be able to as they were Covid-positive in the past few days. “When a person is tested positive, the vaccine dose is administered at least three months after he/she is discharged. This is a major technical issue that many are facing. Many are, therefore, unable to take the vaccine shots,” said Dr Bhoye. Though the exact number of such cases cannot be spelt out, it could be more than 30% of those due for the second vaccine dose. In September and October, the vaccination numbers were very high. Technically, all those beneficiaries were due for the second dose in December and January. But since many tested positive between November and January, they will now have to wait till the February-April period for the second dose. “While these people cannot be vaccinated, a special drive is being carried out for the completion of vaccination of others. The health teams will be visiting homes to seek feedback and administer the second dose,” Dr Bhoye said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/many-unable-to-take-2nd-jab-due-to-recent-infection/articleshow/89081908.cms||---

Civic chief Devidas Tekale has made some changes in the rule to increase the responsibility among officials for the vaccination drive carried out in their jurisdiction especially after six people, including three civic employees, were arrested by police in a case where fake vaccine certificates were issued. “The appointment of medical officers is to supervise the vaccination process, file daily reports on vaccine consumption and sessions created. They are also authorized to register complaints with police if they come across any irregularities. These are some of the measures taken by us to ensure that such incidents are not repeated,” Tekale said. The officers will also be accountable for the number of the vaccine doses delivered at a centre along with those administered and returned. They have been asked to raise a flag for any kind of discrepancy noticed by them so that the issues could be resolved at the earliest. “We have requested police to send their squads for surprise visits at vaccination centres to ensure there was no law and order situation there. The medical officers also have been asked to seek help from local police if there was any case of coercing by the people for certificates and vaccines which was out of the legal framework,” Tekale said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/officers-appointed-to-monitor-vax-drive-in-dhule/articleshow/89081909.cms||---

Among the primary reasons the Hubballi Electricity Supply Company (Hescom) is grappling with a financial crisis is that it is owed bills cumulatively worth Rs 556 crore by various government departments – many of the outstanding bills date back to three years. Consequently, Hescom is struggling to clear its dues to power generators.Gram panchayats supplied power by Hescom owe the power company of the sum, nearly Rs 307.7 crore, while urban local bodies, including the Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation (HDMC) and Belagavi City Corporation have arrears worth Rs 129.1 crore. The Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd and other central government agencies owe Hescom nearly Rs 6 crore, while other state government agencies owe Hescom Rs 15.9 crore. Hescom has served a notice to the government agencies multiple times, but there has been no response to any of these pleas. The finances of the power company remain in a perilous state as a result. Hescom managing director D Bharati said, “If the government departments fail to settle the pending bills, the company’s financial burden will only grow. Hescom has to pay a sum of Rs 4,591 crore for purchasing power.”Hescom has to pay Rs 1,476 crore to central power generating stations, Rs 1,647 to state-run stations, and Rs 1,467 to private power companies. Given its delicate financial condition, Hescom was forced to avail of loans to clear its dues to power generating stations. The public, meanwhile, has had to take on the expense of the interest on these loans, a source said.Dr MC Sindhur, a Hubballi-based activist, questioned the failure of the government to act against errant agencies that are dragging their feet in settling electricity bills. “If the public fails to pay the electricity bill on time, power supply to houses is promptly stopped. Why is it that the same rules do not apply to government departments? Hescom must initiate strict action against these departments, and ensure that the overdue bills are paid,” Sindhur said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/various-govt-depts-owe-hescom-more-than-550cr/articleshow/89081916.cms||---

Patil, a three-time Belagavi South MLA, is also lobbying for a cabinet berth. On Saturday night, BJP MLAs from the district held a meeting at Umesh Katti’s residence. Balachandra Jarkiholi and Ramesh Jarkiholi did not attend it. Sources said the MLAs discussed cabinet expansion and the possible contenders. However, Abhay Patil, while confirming about the meeting, said: “There was no discussion about cabinet expansion in the meeting, but on budget. I spoke about the city’s needs in the budget and that’s all.” When asked about his statement to a section of reporters on cabinet rejig, he said his stance was clear from the beginning. “The new minister should get enough time to perform. Hence, it is advisable to expand the cabinet now. The minister should prove by working for his/her department and any further delay will deny him/her of the opportunity,” he said. If the reshuffle does take place now, the ministers will get close to one year to prove their capabilities before elections are announced for 2023. When asked as to why Balachandra and Ramesh skipped the meeting, he asked the media to speak to them directly. Abhay Patil was one of the aspirants and was upset during the last expansion. Claiming to be a loyal member of the BJP, Patil is once again hoping for the high command to accommodate him in the cabinet. Earlier, MP Renukacharya, political secretary to the CM, had urged the leadership at the state executive committee meeting to give an opportunity to youngsters. However, chief minister Basavaraj Bommai said that the party top brass was yet to decide on the reshuffle or intimate him about it.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/expand-cabinet-immediately-bjp-mlas/articleshow/89081917.cms||---

In all, the Janasnehi centres across Haveri district received 30,078 applications, with citizens seeking delivery of various government services, and 29,808 of them being disposed of. Haveri was trailed by Belagavi and Mandya districts in disposal of applications filed at the Janasnehi centres.Director of Atalji Janasnehi Directorate Gangubai Manakar has, in acknowledgement of Haveri’s accomplishment, sent a congratulatory note to deputy commissioner Sanjay Shettenevar. The Atalji Janasnehi Centres were set up across the state to offer services of the revenue department to the people in a manner that was transparent, reliable and affordable. In all, there are 769 such centres across Karnataka.Sources in the revenue department said that delivery of services in Haveri had picked up pace following Basavaraj Bommai’a apointment to the chief minister’s chair, given that the North Karnataka district was the CM’s home district. They attributed the impressive performance vis-à-vis disposal of applications to officials heeding valuable advice from peers and elected representatives alike. On the other hand, apathetic officials are being disciplined, and directed to address people’s problems.Unfortunately, another North Karnataka district, Ballari, is at the bottom when it comes to disposal of applications filed at the Atalji Janasnehi Centres. Chikkamagaluru and Kalaburagi are the other districts languishing at the bottom of the list when it comes to disposal of applications for various services from the revenue department.‘Officials working well’Haveri deputy commissioner Sanjay Shettennevar said, “I have instructed the staff to expedite work on all applications filed at these centres, and all officials have been working very diligently to ensure that all pleas are attended to on time.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/haveri-tops-in-delivery-of-janasnehi-centre-services/articleshow/89081920.cms||Basavaraj Maralihalli

So, the option is added in the RTC management software. The document on the Bhoomi software is important and one has to work on it responsibly. If some wrong information is added, concerned officials will be held responsible,” the circular added.The circular was communicated to the deputy commissioners of all districts and they have been instructed to direct all assistant commissioners and tahsildars.Welcoming the move, Shankar Ambali, the state president of the Karnataka Rait Sene, said that it is convenient for farmers to add or delete the cultivator’s name from the RTC. “However, there is also a possibility of misusing it with the nexus of officials. Someone can add someone’s name in the cultivator column in the RTC of a government land and later he can claim his right to such land. The government should also think of avoiding such cases,” he said.A tahsildar in Davangere district said that the order had enhanced accountability of officials involved in the process. “Many times, farmers used to add someone’s name in the cultivator’s column. Once he died, it used to become problematic for us to identify his successor. As the cultivator was claiming his right, it used to lead to land disputes in court. Now this order has also come as a rescue for officers as farmers can easily a delete cultivator’s name,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/cultivator-correction-option-to-help-landowners/articleshow/89081921.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

The BJP has 18 seats here but if the Congress legislators are inducted into the voters’ list here, it could be in trouble when it tries to claim majority.Kondajji said: “This trend was initiated by the BJP itself at Kalaburagi and Davanagere. Now we are doing the same in Gadag to teach a lesson to the ruling party in state and at the Centre. We are not violating any rule in this procedure.”Congress representatives have given some local addresses in their application. Apart from 15 members, the Congress is expecting support from two independent members who were Congress rebel candidates. If the names of three MLCs and a Rajya Sabha member are added to city’s voters’ list, the Congress’s strength will increase to 21 and it may get the president’s post in the Gadag-Betgeri City Municipal Council (GBCMC).Source in the district administration confirmed that the three MLCs and the MP (Rajya Sabha) have applied to induct their name in voters’ list, on January 14. “As per the norm, the applicants should be residents of the concerned area for at least 6 months. We will dispose applications as per rules of election commission,” the source said.Interestingly, BJP MLC S V Sankanur, who hails from Gadag, has shifted his residential address to Dharwad where the BJP could get majority. As the BJP is in trouble at the GBCMC, he is allegedly getting back to Gadag to ensure that the BJP is in power in his hometown.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/cong-follows-bjps-address-ploy-to-win-city-council-post/articleshow/89081923.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

The situation relatively better in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Kerala. “Among Bengaluru stations, Silk Board has only 61% while Peenya and Jayanagar with 64% and 68%. Only 12 out of 21 stations of Karnataka outside Bengaluru meet the minimum requirement of 75%. It’s not clear why these stations have such poor data availability, this requires additional assessment,” the analysis stressed.Analysis has also stated that data availability calculated as number of days with adequate PM2.5 data for computation of a valid 24hr-average has been low in 19 of 39 cities of 5 states. “For the second half of the year 2021, data availability at city railway station and Sanegurava Halli stations of Bengaluru and Udupi has been zero percent. Kalaburagi and Bidar have registered just 39% and 7% data availability respectively. Gadag and Kalaburagi also report significant bad air days, in fact air quality index (AQI) in these cities can cross into very poor AQI category but due to massive amount of missing data it is unclear how long these bad air episodes actually last.”‘Officials not concerned’Commenting on the analysis, former IFS officer and environmentalist Dr A N Yellappa Reddy lamented that air quality monitoring stations are left with no proper maintenance and are installed just for name sake. “Even if the data is available, it is not accurate as many of them are under construction for 2-3 years at tall buildings from where pollution will be circulated in surround areas. This is happening as there is no seriousness among officials of Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB). Most of KSPCB officials are engaged only in income generating activities” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/data-gaps-threaten-states-fight-against-air-pollution/articleshow/89081926.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

The transport department is now contemplating starting a drive to get vehicle users to complete the installation of the number plate in a bid to encourage completion of fitments. “There are a lot of HSRPs ready for installation, yet are lying with the vendor. People have paid for number plates but are not showing up for its fitment owing to the pandemic. With the reduction in staff at fitment every centre due to insufficient booking orders, everything has come to a standstill and the operations have further slowed down,” a transport officer said. There are some vehicle owners that are living overseas, while many others have yet to come forward to even make the booking for HSRPs, the officer said. Owing to the sharp decline in HSRP bookings and installations, the directorate of transport decided to start the drive from this month onwards. However, the rise in Covid-19 infection cases and election code of conduct has pushed the plans for the drive to a later date. For now, text messages may be sent out to vehicle owners as reminders for the pending installation in a bid to have the HSRPs that are ready and lying with vendors, to be installed. Currently, only new vehicle owners have been able to get vehicles pre-installed with HSRPs directly from the respective car dealerships. Vehicles that were purchased prior to the law coming into force were therefore mandated to install the unique number plate.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/hsrp-staff-reduced-after-drop-in-fitments/articleshow/89101338.cms||TNN

NGT noted that the project already has CRZ and forest clearances, and has said that the project was necessary, being a public utility. The tribunal said that the construction can resume under monitoring by state agencies to ensure that the set environmental guidelines are followed. “We direct the secretary (environment), principal chief conservator of forests, state environment impact assessment authority and Goa coastal zone management authority to monitor the compliance of conditions for permissions under the CRZ regulation as well as under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980,” the NGT said. Subject to such monitoring, it will be open to the project proponent to proceed with the construction complying with all such conditions,” the NGT has said. The tribunal had earlier disposed of a previous application filed by Goa Foundation after the National Institute of Ocean Technology, Chennai (NIOT), in its report dated February 8, 2016, said the bridge could be constructed provided that mitigation measures suggested by the institute are complied with. “Having regard to the fact that Tiracol bridge may be a matter of public utility and the same can be constructed without any adverse damage to the environment, there is no justification to stop the same in absence of any illegality being shown,” the NGT said. However, Goa Foundation later filed a writ petition in the high court, stating that it could not put its point as it wanted before the NGT. The high court, in its order in March last year, then gave Goa Foundation the liberty to approach the NGT again to highlight its grievance. Goa Foundation approached the NGT again stating that several of its grievances had not been examined by the Tribunal. “The estuarine area, also being the principal fishing grounds of the villagers, would be damaged by the piers to be located in the estuary on both sides of the Tiracol river. The alignment of the bridge was decided at the behest of the owners of a proposed luxury golf course resort to be constructed in Tiracol, i.e., chiefly for private purpose although propped up as a public utility,” Goa Foundation told NGT. The tribunal, however, said that it went through the application again and did not find merit in the case. The NGT noted that the GCZMA permission was granted on May 22, 2011, and therefore the project is exempted from EIA notification. “In view of the fact that CRZ clearance has been granted, against which the appeal has been dismissed and in-principle approval under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 Act has also been granted, no interference is called for by this tribunal. However, by way of precaution, it may be necessary to direct that compliance of conditions for such clearances must be ensured,” the NGT said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/ngt-paves-way-for-tiracol-bridge-construction-to-continue/articleshow/89101789.cms||---

---||Goa||CII submits growth roadmap to parties ahead of elections||Panaji: Ahead of the assembly elections, the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII-Goa) met with major political parties that are in the fray and presented a growth roadmap for the coming five years. Among its key recommendations, CII has said that Goa needs to focus on e-governance and ease of doing business, not just for the private sector, but for the common man, too. CII chairman Atul Jadhav along with vice chairperson Swati Salgaocar met and discussed the agenda for development with BJP, Congress, AAP and TMC, offering a detailed presentation on factors that need urgent redressal. Pointing out that the private sector, particularly manufacturing industries, have faced delays for more than a year, CII has stressed on the need for single-window approvals with time bound and faceless approvals. “E-governance should be extended to all aspects of public service delivery. A common facilitation centre should be established throughout the state,” Jadhav said. CII has also highlighted the tremendous opportunity that can be unlocked by creating rural business hubs and entrepreneurship clusters. The need to develop Mormugao port into a multi-purpose general cargo terminal with linkage to international maritime cargo traffic is also vital, CCI said as it also asked the government to explore ways to develop MPT into an international cruise terminal with worldclass facilities. Touching upon Goa’s mining industry, which has been shut for the better part of a decade, CII called for a task force to be constituted with all stakeholders on board to discuss the mining situation in Goa. “CII Goa will continue to extend all support to the government in the growth story of the industry and the state of Goa,” Salgaocar said. The industry body has also said that Goa urgently requires a comprehensive and transparent logistics policy, which is implemented in a time-bound manner. The policy should focus on infrastructure creation, skill development, employment generation and standardisation. Smart industrial estates with robust internet connectivity, food processing clusters, adequate infrastructure and environmental sustainability are among the focus areas that CII has touched upon.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/cii-submits-growth-roadmap-to-parties-ahead-of-elections/articleshow/89101340.cms||---

Some among them, especially the elderly and with co-morbid conditions, are concerned at the rising Covid-19 cases and many across educational institutions in Madurai have tested positive too.“We were asked to attend a training programme and have been reporting at school even though we don’t have much work. Many of us make use of public transport which puts us at risk. A few colleagues tested Covid-19 positive too,” said a government school teacher. Teachers in some aided and private schools have also been conducting online classes from their school campuses.“Teachers can be asked to report to school as and when needed on rotational basis and they can also conduct online classes from home. However, we are unofficially told to report to campus though we should not be forced to do it,” said a teacher from a private school. On the other hand, school heads said there is some work to be done which require presence of teachers on the campus and for smooth holding of online classes.“The concerns of teachers are valid. But there is some academic and administrative work to be done and we also have to continue to be in touch with students. We will not be able to monitor teachers properly if they work from home. When most other public places and offices are functional, there is no reason why teachers cannot come to school. We don’t force them to come if they feel unwell,” said the headmaster of a government aided school.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/teachers-reporting-for-work-say-they-risk-catching-covid/articleshow/89081949.cms||---

In Kamarajar Salai too, near the Teppakulam, marriages took place though the crowds were much lesser. With public transport absent and taxi services refusing to come for short distances, fares almost tripled. V P Manikandan said he had to pay Rs 202 for a ride that usually cost him only Rs 100.K Sudha of K K Nagar said they had called off her niece’s wedding at the last moment because markets and shops were closed and getting flowers for a basic decoration was going to be a problem. All shops remained closed but hotels were open and there were brisk delivery services. As meat and fish stalls were closed, there was good demand for non-vegetarian food like biryani, said a delivery person. Some meat stalls however delivered meat late on Saturday.Roads in the city especially around Meenakshi Amman temple were deserted and movement of people was also less. All shops remained closed on Sunday in the wake of last week’s bitter experience when several of them were booked for opening during lockdown. Police personnel were on patrol and were conducting checks at various spots including important junctions. A police officer said that most of those who were checked cited reasons such as going to pharmacy, hospital or marriage function and hence had to be allowed. Police were also monitoring marriage halls where functions were conducted .||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/marriages-outside-closed-temples-mark-shutdown/articleshow/89081950.cms||---

The team comprising additional chief medical officer (ACMO), district immunization officer (DIO) and district programme manager (DPM) has been asked to submit the inquiry report by Monday, Dr Nath told TOI. “The district health office received the information from the locals that some unused vials of Covid vaccine were found in the garbage near the Raghunathpur PHC on Saturday. On receiving the information, I formed a team to verify the matter. Wastage of vaccine is not acceptable and if such things have happened, action will be taken against those responsible for this,” Dr Nath said. ACMO Bhatt said, “It is too early to say anything as we are still investigating the matter. We have found 3-4 unused vials of vaccine from the garbage near the Raghunathpur PHC.” The PHC incharge, Dr Vinod Kumar, said Covishield vials had been found in the garbage. “We are inquiring about the team of health workers who had been provided the vials. By matching the batch number written on the vaccine vials and tally sheet given to the verifiers, we will find out which team was given how many shots and how many people had been administered the vaccine doses,” he said. “Being the incharge, I am also responsible for this negligence.

The incident took place at Hardiya Koeri Tola village under Muffasil police station area. The villagers also seized the vehicle on which ‘minister, tourism department’ was written above the numberplate. The video of the incident went viral in which the minister’s son, Bablu Kumar, can be seen being thrashed by villagers. Police said the villagers also snatched away a gun from Bablu which he used to scare away the children. According to the villagers, trouble broke out when Bablu went there with his supporters and asked the children to leave his orchard and the nearby farmland. Bablu allegedly thrashed some of the children and also took out his gun and opened fire to scare away the children. West Champaran SP Upendra Verma said Bablu was accompanied by his uncle Harendra Prasad, manager Vijay Sah and other associates. All of them sustained injuries in the clash. Minister alleges encroachmentBablu told police that he went to the farmland with his men upon learning about an attempt of "land encroachment". He said they were assaulted and robbed of the licensed gun by the villagers. Their vehicles were also vandalized by the villagers. The minister, however, accused the villagers of trying to encroach his land in the orchard. He said the villagers first attacked his younger brother who had objected to the encroachment of his land by the locals, after which a few of his other family members were also thrashed. "After my family members were beaten up by the villagers, my son went to the spot with his licensed gun and pistol, but he was also attacked with stones. The villagers also vandalized my vehicle," the minister told reporters. The opposition RJD attacked the Nitish Kumar government over the incident. "Did the minister's son have the right to attack the children who were playing cricket? There is no law and order in Bihar. When ministers break law, then who will enforce it in the state," questioned former RJD MLA Shakti Singh Yadav.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/mins-son-brother-beaten-up-in-w-champaran-for-opening-fire/articleshow/89081954.cms||Madan Kumar

---||Patna||Patna's air quality better after rain||PATNA: After remaining ‘very poor' for the last five days, the air quality in the state capital slightly improved to come in the “poor” category on Sunday. As per the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) bulletin, the overall air quality index (AQI) of the city was recorded at 291 on Sunday, compared to 375 on Saturday. The improvement was attributed to a brief spell of rain in the morning. The Air Quality Early Warning System of the ministry of earth sciences forecastes cleaner air in Patna in the next two days owing to favourable meteorological conditions and relatively stronger winds, which may help in dispersion of the pollutants trapped in the environment. An AQI between’0’ and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51-100 ‘satisfactory’, 101-200 ‘moderate’, 201-300 ‘poor’, 301-400 ‘very poor’ and 401-500 ‘severe’. A ‘poor’ AQI essentially means that people may suffer respiratory illness or breathing discomfort on prolonged exposure. The pollutant level of the city is calculated on the AQI level of six continuous ambient air quality monitoring stations in Patna. Three of them were in poor zone — BIT-Mesra, Patna (230), SK Memorial Hall (246) and DRM office-Khagaul (268). The other three other stations registered ‘very poor’ AQI -- Eco Park (343), Planetarium (334) and Patna City (325).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/city-air-quality-better-after-rain/articleshow/89081956.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Patna||JD(U) to raise special status demand for Bihar again||PATNA: Chief minister Nitish Kumar's JD(U) on Sunday made a fresh pitch for grant of special category status to the state, and vowed to hit the streets besides making itself heard in Parliament to press for the demand.  Party's national president Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan came out with a series of tweets wherein he sought to assert that the state was not seeking charity from the Centre, but wanted its rightful due. “By demanding special category status, the people of Bihar are neither begging nor are they asking for a loan,"” Lalan said in a strongly-worded tweet in Hindi. “The people of Bihar want from the Centre what is their rightful due. We will keep lending our voice to them and raising the matter from the streets to the House (sansad se sadak tak),” said the JD(U) chief, who is also Lok Sabha MP from Munger. He also attached to his tweets a poster and a video enumerating the benefits that grant of special status is likely to bring in its wake, and lamenting the non-fulfilment of the long-standing demand. The aggressive stance by the party comes close on the heels of a cold shoulder on the issue from the BJP, its ally, which also rules the Centre. State BJP president Sanjay Jaiswal had last week virtually rubbished the demand for special category status by claiming that the central aid Bihar received was greater than what a more populous province like Maharashtra was getting.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/jdu-to-raise-spl-status-demand-for-bihar-again/articleshow/89081957.cms||---

But there was a great relief on Sunday as only two official Covid deaths were reported in the state. In this third wave, January 14 had the maximum 6541 new cases but only two deaths. Though the number of new cases has been declining since then, 11 Covid patients died on January 19 and the number was same on January 21. As on January 19, Bihar had 4,063 cases, which came down to 2,768 on Sunday. Similar trend was also seen during the second wave, when deaths slightly increased after the peak while the daily caseloads were decreasing. During the second wave, cases started decreasing from May 7 onwards. Bihar had 15,126 new cases and 90 deaths on May 6. After a week, on May 13, the daily Covid caseload reduced to 7,752, but the deaths reported remained 90. Nodal incharge for Covid-19 at AIIMS-Patna, Dr Sanjeev Kumar, said there has been a trend that the number of deaths continues to rise for sometime even after the declining trend in daily caseload. He cited late hospitalisation as one of the reasons. “Many people who got infected during the peak, but came to the hospital late,” he said. He further said most of the patients died of Covid had co-morbidities. However, he said, 14-15 daily deaths were reported at his hospital during the second wave, while the maximum seven patients died on any single day this time. IGIMS superintendent Dr Manish Mandal as well as the nodal inchrage of Covid-19 at JLNMCH, Dr H S Sharma, said the deaths in the third wave were much less than the number of patients who died during the second wave. “All the patients who have died at my hospital actually came for some other treatment. However, as per the protocol, we had to test them for Covid and they were found positive. Most of the deaths happened because of haemorrhage or stroke,” Dr Mandal said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/great-relief-as-number-of-cov-19-deaths-also-down/articleshow/89081959.cms||Sheezan Nezami

On being asked whether Sahani has threatened to field candidates from all the 24 local authorities’ constituencies for the council polls if his demand for four seats are not fulfilled by the NDA, Prasad said, “We (BJP) have never contested council polls with the VIP. Instead, we got elected Sahani as member of the council because he is one of our important allies.” Elected members of the three-tier panchayati raj institutions (PRIs) and urban local bodies (ULBs) vote in the local authorities’ constituencies of the legislative council. The 24 seats fell vacant on July 16, 2021 after the previous elected MLCs completed their six years’ term. Contacted over the phone, VIP spokesperson Rajiv Mishra told TOI on Sunday that his party has made necessary preparations to contest all 24 council seats, if it was not given four seats as the NDA partner.When asked to name the four constituencies which the VIP wants to contest, Mishra said he would not reveal the names right now because it would cause more problems among the allies. “The Election Commission is yet to notify the council polls. Once the notification is issued, we will formally forward the names of four seats to the NDA top leaders,” Mishra said.He also said the deputy CM was correct in his statement, but the last council polls for 24 seats were held in 2015 and the VIP came into existence in 2018 only. “Hence, there is no question of contesting these polls in alliance earlier. Even JD(U) was not the BJP’s ally in 2015 when the last polls were held,” Mishra pointed out. In the 2015 polls, the BJP had won 11 seats, the JD(U) five, RJD four, LJP one, Congress one and Independent two. Later on, one of the independent winners, Ashok Kumar Agarwal (Katihar), and LJP’s lone MLC Nutan Singh joined the BJP, taking its tally to 13 in the 24 seats. Similarly, RJD’s three MLCs — Radha Charan Sah (Bhojpur-Buxar)), Dilip Rai (Sitamarhi-Sheohar) and Sanjay Prasad (Muger) joined the JD(U), taking its number to eight. Congress MLC Rajesh Ram (West Champaran) also joined the JD(U) a few months back. The current strength of members in the state legislative council is 51 against the total of 75.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/bjp-rejects-sahanis-demandfor-4-council-seats-to-contest/articleshow/89081961.cms||Madan Kumar

They have put banners at several places which read ‘No road, no vote’. They would not vote on February 20 till their demands were met, said the office-bearers of the mandal.Despite several requests to the local representatives, including the MLA and UP minister Ajit Pal regarding construction of broken reads and proper drainage system, nothing has been done so far, They alleged. “During the rainy season, water enters deep inside our shops, causing a lot of damage to goods. Every time leaders come and ask for our votes and make assurances but the problem remains the same. BJP MLA Ajit Pal also gave assurances at the time of the last election but all in vain. We had sent applications to the high government officials, even to the chief minister, but all our pleas fell on deaf ears,” said Rama Shankar Shukla.It becomes difficult for him to walk to reach the local Community Health Centre, said 80-year-old voter Mahesh. “For the last 40 years, the condition of the roads has remained unchanged,” Mahesh said and added that 300 families of the area would have benefited had there been a proper road here. “Locals collected donations from the people to fill big potholes with bricks but the condition of the road is pathetic. This is the main road. The netas come at the time of elections and give assurances but do nothing in this regard”, said a local.This time we have hung a banner and decided not to vote in the forthcoming assembly elections.

The state pollution control board has issued notice to this effect to five partners of the firm. The NGT has taken action after conducting verification that industrial waste was thrown at Rania in Kanpur Dehat. A petition filed in the NGT alleged that the firm had disposed of chromium waste against the set standards of its disposal. According to regional officer of state pollution control board, Radhey Shyam, the committee, constituted by the NGT for conducting spot inquiry, found gross negligence in disposal of chromium waste at Rania in Kanpur Dehat. The NGT then imposed a fine of Rs 19,85,25,772 against the firm and directed the state pollution control board to recover the amount from the five partners of the firm. The copies of the NGT order have been sent to the partners of the firm, the board said. The committee stated in its report that the firm had dumped around 4,411.684 metric tonne chromium waste at Rania after which the NGT calculated the environmental damages and slapped a fine accordingly. In 2019, NGT had imposed a fine to the tune of Rs 280 crore against six chemical factories of Khan Chandrapur at Rania Akbarpur in Kanpur Dehat on the charge of dumping chromium waste. As the factory owners have preferred an appeal against the fine, therefore, the fine could not be realised so far, said regional pollution control board officer JP Maurya.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kanpur/ngt-slaps-19-8cr-fine-on-factory-for-disposing-chemical/articleshow/89081965.cms||---

The cops were later allowed to go. Goa police said that the demand for proper facilities was a mere excuse, and in reality, the inmates were demanding that they be released from the centre and lodged in judicial lock-up. Police said that inmates have been provided all facilities available in judicial custody. Police sources also said that this is a “regular feature” at the centre, as they want to be released. “The inmates lodged at the centre blocked the on-duty police personnel from leaving the centre after their duty hours. After they held a discussion with the police officials, the inmates let the police personnel go,” FRRO SP Shekhar Prabhudesai told TOI. In all, there are 12 inmates lodged at the detention centre, including two women. Most of these inmates are Nigerians. Police said that they have been granted conditional bail in criminal cases, but have been lodged at the centre as they do not possess valid documents. No sooner than they blocked the personnel, the inmates demanded discussions with senior police officers. The Mapusa dySP and PI rushed to the centre immediately and held discussions with the inmates.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/african-nationals-at-detention-centre-hold-cops-hostage/articleshow/89101353.cms||---

The list is likely to be announced on Tuesday, said state president Sadanand Shet Tanavade. BJP announced the first list of 34 candidates last week. BJP has shortlisted three names in Santa Cruz — incumbent BJP MLA Antonio Fernandes, Chimbel ZP member Girish Uskaikar, and close aide of Panaji MLA Atanasio ‘Babush’ Monserrate and former Taleigao sarpanch Agnelo da Cunha. Monserrate is strongly pushing for the candidature of da Cunha, as he wants to expand his base in Tiswadi taluka. A senior BJP functionary said that there are two names in Cumbharjua— sitting MLA Pandurang Madkaikar, and Union minister for state Shripad Naik’s son Siddhesh. A third, BJP member Rohan Harmalkar, is also hopeful of securing the ticket. With the delay in announcing the second list, Madkaikar said that he has already started his campaign as all aspiring candidates are claiming that they will get the party’s candidature. “If I am denied the party ticket, I will contest as an independent candidate. My supporters have requested me to start the campaign, so I have already launched it,” he said, stressing that the party has not told him that he would be denied the ticket. BJP has already shortlisted single names in the remaining three constituencies of Bicholim, Cortalim, Curtorim, and has two names in Calangute constituency. Recently, BJP cleared the name of its Bicholim MLA and Goa legislative assembly speaker Rajesh Patnekar as its candidate.

---||Ludhiana||‘Cong, BJP are each other’s ‘B’ team’||Ludhiana: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain on Sunday said the people of Punjab were determined to elect AAP government and that too with overwhelming majority. “The culture of AAP is to bring the common people to the fore and make them work for the people and society. This has been done in Delhi and will be done in Punjab now,” he added. AAP has fielded K N S Kang from Dakha assembly constituency for the upcoming elections and Jain was in the district to campaign for him. Jain addressed a press conference in Ludhiana on Sunday and said the condition of industries across Punjab was not good, as it was lagging behind. “We will not disturb the industry here,” he said. “So far, the successive Punjab governments have been harassing the industry rather than encouraging it. In such a situation, people of Punjab are moving to other states and setting up industries there. AAP government will create such an environment that the industrialists here will be able to do their work without any fear or hassle,” he promised.Jain also said the healthcare system of Punjab is non existent. Jain said he had personally visited Chamkaur Sahib, constituency of Punjab chief minister Channi, and was shocked to see the health services available there. “The sector needs a lot of improvement. With the formation of AAP government in Punjab, first of all ‘village clinics’ will be opened in every village and the responsibility for the health of all the citizens of the state will be borne by the state government,” he said adding that if the government will take care of the health of the people of the state, then the people will take care of the state themselves.Responding to a question, Jain said both Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) were claiming that the AAP is a ‘B’ team, while the truth is that, both Congress and BJP are each other's ‘B’ team. He said all other parties are colluding together to defeat AAP in the Punjab assembly elections, but the people of Punjab are not fooled by these parties and AAP will win with an overwhelming majority.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/cong-bjp-are-each-others-b-team/articleshow/89081971.cms||---

As this is a serious matter, we requested the ADCP to intervene and tackle such elements. Besides this we requested him to ensure 100% surveillance of industrial areas and focal points as the robbery incidents with migrant labourers are on the rise in these areas. Employers and employees are on the move in focal points around the clock but there is no security or surveillance which can make us feel safe.”According to Rajeev Jain, general secretary of FICO, “We have also demanded that the police personnel halt points should also be set up in every phase of focal points, so that in case of emergency the industrialists and workers can approach the police parties at the earliest, There is also a need to increase the number of PCR vans in focal points. During the meeting, businessmen also requested that police should connect all the CCTV cameras installed in the industrial areas and industrial focal points of Ludhiana with a centralised police control room, so as to ensure more surveillance.”ADCP Randhawa assured the businessmen that Ludhiana police will ensure the security in these areas.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/cops-bizmen-meet-to-discuss-issues-in-industrial-areas/articleshow/89081972.cms||---

From south constituency, the PLC has announced Prem Mittal, but BJP workers claimed that they will not support this parachute candidate and party should give chance to own leaders who are working hard in these areas for a long time. A meeting took place in south constituency from where Surinder Sharma had given application to contest elections. The workers claimed that they will support Sharma, who is an old party loyalist from this constituency and Prem Mittal is a parachute candidate. Similar type of voices are being raised from east constituency as this seat has also been given to PLC whereas BJP leaders had shown interest in contesting from this seat as well. BJP leaders have kept three seats —of which, west and central are announced while north constituency is also going to be announced shortly. One of the workers said finally BJP candidates were able to contest elections without interference of any other party and now they have to share seats with Captain and Dhindsa, which is very disappointing for workers. He said there were many candidates who were demanding ticket but now they will have to denied. Meanwhile, a senior BJP leader claimed that party is concentrating on chances of winning maximum seats so they are giving chances to candidates accordingly.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/bjp-ticket-aspirants-dissatisfied-with-seat-allocation/articleshow/89081976.cms||---

The percentage of fully vaccinated persons in the district has increased substantially in January. The health department had earlier faced challenges in convincing people to receive the second dose.As per the health department data, the percentage of fully vaccinated people till January 22 evening was 64.43. It was 49.16% on December 31 last. Therefore, there has been an increase of 15.27%.December 2021 saw the figure rising by 6.57% and November last by 4.59%.There has been an 8.66% increase in those who received the first dose of vaccination from December 31 to January 22. In December 2021, there was a 2.29% rise in the first dose vaccination and 2.64% in November 2021.The report shows that 52.96% of the healthcare workers (HCWs) have received both the doses and 25.23% the booster shot. To date, 35.84% of the frontline workers have got fully vaccinated and 4.94% have received the booster dose. The percentage of persons in 18 to 44 years age group who have received both the doses is 61.03.

Of 60-year-plus persons, 2.17% have got the precaution dose.The health department authorities said immunisation has increased across all the categories. “There are multiple reasons for increase in vaccination. First, it was less earlier as for two months a number of healthcare workers were on strike so we didn’t have manpower. After they withdrew the strike, we increased the session sites. The other reason is the entry of those who were not fully vaccinated was not allowed at public places. And thirdly, as the prevalence of disease is more, people are coming forward to get immunised,” said civil surgeon Dr S P Singh. “Fully vaccinated people can also get infection, but they are likely to be asymptomatic or have mild symptoms,” said Ludhiana IMA secretary Dr Bimal Kanish.6.85% of 15-18-yr olds get 1st doseOf the target of 2,15,000 in 15-18-year group, 14,738 (6.85%) were vaccinated till January 22.

In almost every fire incident, lack of fire safety arrangements have come to fore and the building bylaws made it mandatory for the building branch and fire officials to go on joint inspections whenever any building plan is given sanction. Contrary to the rules, hardly a single joint inspection has been done so far.According to the report, from 2016 till 2021 in all four zones, 7,471 building plans were approved, only 1312 buildings got fire NOC. The additional commissioner has submitted in the report that fire officials and MC building branch officials did not work in coordination which resulted in financial loss to the civic body and also increased the irregular activities. However the civic authorities have not taken action over this report till date and it was submitted around two months ago.According to new bylaws, MC officials will forward building plans to the chief fire officer for obtaining clearance along with prescribed fee, after ensuring that the proposals are in line with the master plan of the area. The plans should be clearly marked and indicate the complete fire protection arrangements. The chief fire officer should examine these plans to ensure that they are in accordance with the provisions of fire safety and should forward two sets of plans duly signed for implementation to the building sanctioning MC.Meanwhile, despite repeated attempts, senior town planner S S Bindra could not be contacted for his comments.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/no-coordination-of-building-branch-fire-dept-report/articleshow/89081980.cms||---

After starting his career with the Congress, he moved to SAD, then to Lok Insaaf Party, returned to the Congress and now he has joined the PLC.Satinderpal Singh Tajpuri is the son of a former cooperation minister in the SAD government, while Damanjeet Singh Mohi was an active Youth Congress functionary and was earlier sarpanch, zila parishad member and chairman of market committee, Mullanpur, and also OSD to Captain Amarinder Singh when he was the chief minister. Speaking to the TOI, a jubilant Jagmohan Sharma said, “I am grateful to Captain Amarinder Singh for considering me for such a big responsibility. I want to assure my party that I will leave no stone unturned to ensure PLC’s victory on all the seats of Ludhiana. I am certain that together our coalition of PLC, BJP and Shiromani Akali Dal (Sanyukt) will sweep the polls in Punjab and we will form the next government.”A BJP leader, who was eyeing ticket from Atam Nagar, said, “It is a setback for loyal and old workers of the party, as tickets on four seats have been either given to turncoats or people who are unknown. It would have been better had our high command given PLC segments in other districts because on all these seats of Ludhiana there was a bright chance of BJP candidates emerging victorious as compared to other coalition partners’ contestants.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/plc-names-four-candidates-from-dist-constituencies-bjp-ticket-seekers-sore/articleshow/89081981.cms||Mohit Behl

She alleged that Bains has been roaming freely and conducting rallies with police security, but the cops are claiming that he is on the run and untraceable.The woman, 44, in her complaint to the chief electoral officer (CEO), said she had to approach the court to get an FIR lodged in this case against Bains and his accomplices Karamjit Singh, Baljinder Kaur, Jasbir Kaur, Sukhchain Singh, Parmjit Singh and Gogi Sharma. She said non-bailable warrants were issued through the commissioner of police for December 23 last, but on January 10, a police official appeared before the court and sought an adjournment, saying that the officer responsible for executing the proclamation proceedings was not well. She said it was clear that the police were working under political pressure and deliberately helping the accused. Bains has been evading arrest since the registration of FIR, so necessary action should be taken against him as he is roaming freely and holding public meetings and rallies and enjoying police security, she added. “Necessary directions be issued to the Ludhiana police commissioner to arrest the accused…and justice be delivered,” she stated.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/rape-case-complainant-to-ec-direct-police-to-arrest-bains/articleshow/89081985.cms||---

According to the department data, over 96% of the licenced weapons have been deposited in Ludhiana commissionerate.The gunhouses have received the weapons as per their limit and the rest have been submitted by the licence holders at the respective police stations. However, the security measures at gunhouses are not up to the mark. Ideally, gunhouses should have security guards on both day and night duty, functional CCTVs connected to their cellphones, and a strongroom with alarm system, among others. However, majority of them have security guards at night only and some don’t have any. A gunhouse owner said, “Every gunhouse has a limit of receiving weapons and ammunition, as permitted by the police administration. Some have the limit of receiving 25 weapons, others 50 or more. During the model code of conducted, the police department temporarily increases this limit, so that more weapons can be deposited.” “However, this time the department has not increased the limit. So, we have received the licenced arms as per our limit. Though the commissioner of police had assured to increase the limit and promised to provide a strongroom at the police lines for us to keep the weapons, we are still waiting for the written permission orders,” he added. Another gunhouse owner said, “If gunhouses have to hire a security guard, they will have to pay him at least Rs 10,000 to Rs 15,000. This time, they will not earn much as the police have not increased their limit. So, how can they spend on security guards..” The gunhouses charge Rs 200 per weapon per month from a licence holder. As per the data, about 16,000 licences are issued in city on which over 19,000 weapons have been issued. So far, over 18,000 weapons have been submitted with police and gunhouses. The remaining are of those who are exempted, like senior officials, banks/ ATMs security guards and jewellers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/over-96-licensed-weapons-deposited-ahead-of-elections/articleshow/89081986.cms||---

While the drive began recently, he said that as many as 1.67 lakh beneficiaries have already been vaccinated, out of the total 2.11 lakh such eligible beneficiaries in these limits. “Around 79% of this new age group has been vaccinated by now. Considering our daily vaccination numbers in rural Pune, we are confident that we will complete inoculating the remaining beneficiaries within a week,” Prasad added. Rural Pune covers as many as 13 tehsils and 14 municipal councils of the district. “We have told our primary health centers (PHCs) and gram panchayats to list out all school beneficiaries and vaccinate them on priority. Also, school students who were absent when the vaccination drive was held in their classrooms will be identified in each village and vaccinated on priority in the district,” highlighted Prasad. The ZP, since the beginning of the initiative, has launched vaccination drivse in schools and colleges as part of a rapid coverage strategy. As a result, they could cover maximum students from the said age group. Officials had also taken help from local leaders and activists to speed up the drive. Ever since the drive for this age group has been launched, the rural Pune administration has performed much better than the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC). Under PMC limits, a mere 67,307 beneficiaries out of 2.24 lakh have been vaccinated, while under PCMC just 49,431 out of 1.16 lakh have been vaccinated so far from the said age group, stated the ZP report. “Both the corporations are yet to complete the mark of even 50% till date. We have had a discussion on this issue in a meeting. They will also expedite the drive. The number will go up in the coming days,” a senior official from the health department of the ZP told TOI.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/1-67l-in-15-18-age-group-get-1st-shot-in-rural-pune/articleshow/89081991.cms||---
---||Pune||Teens don’t need parents’ consent for jabs: Top official||PUNE: Consent from parents — written or oral — is not required for teenage Covid vaccination in the 15-17 age group, state immunization officer Dr Sachin Desai confirmed on Sunday. "There is a lot of confusion over seeking parents' consent prior to vaccinating adolescents. But as per the Union government's norms, parents' consent is not required," Dr Desai said. The issue of consent had cropped up soon after vaccination for teens was announced on school and college premises. “Schools are under the impression that they need parents' written or oral consent before vaccinating their teenage students. But that's not the case," Dr Desai said, adding that registration on the CoWIN portal before getting the shot is considered consent. "So schools should not compel students to bring consent letters from parents," he said. The senior official also said the rule applies not only for vaccination at school or college premises, but at hospital-based vaccine centres, too. Senior paediatrician Dr Pramod Jog, a member of the Covid task force, said, “Although parents' written consent is not required, it is advisable that the parents (at least one of them) accompany the child at the time of taking the Covid shot. This will bolster the confidence of the vaccinator at the vaccination centre. Besides, a parent's physical presence is great mental support as well.” Bharat Biotech's Covaxin, which is currently being given to the country’s adolescents (15-17 group) has the Union government's Emergency Use Approval for children (2-18 group). The vaccine has been found safe and effective in children's trials in the 2-18 bracket. Till January 18, officials said they had recorded only 120 cases of minor-side effects among 25 lakh teenagers who had received the Covid vaccine. Of them, 118 cases involved minor side-effects such as redness of the skin or pain at the injection site, minor fever and headache. The remaining two incidents were not related to the Covid-19 vaccine, investigators ruled.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/teens-dont-need-parents-consent-for-jabs-top-official/articleshow/89081993.cms||Umesh Isalkar

However, vendors said that unlike the last wave, food delivery per person has reduced from seven or more days to three or four, though the requirement has increased.Rakhi Srivastava of Propel Stay said that they have three properties in different areas of Viman Nagar, Baner and Hinjewadi and all were completely booked. “Majority of our clients are senior citizens. Sometimes, they travel from Mumbai or other places to Pune, get tested positive and opt for this facility. If earlier we would get booking for seven or more days on an average, that has come down to four-five days as people are recovering faster than in previous waves. We provide them with meals, wifi, TV, coffee, lemon juice, turmeric milk and other essentials too. We also have a doctor on-call facility,” said Srivastava.Devesh Bhatia, owner of Pan India Eatery, said that the demand for meals has increased in the last 10 days. “If earlier, one person per house was infected, now the entire family is and we are getting orders for everyone in the house.

Those living in the complex’s 21-odd apartments find themselves divided between two constituencies. Splitting of votes between two constituencies is not unheard of, but what has raised eyebrows of the residents and political parties is that of the 21 apartments, just one flat has been included in the Fatorda constituency. The resident of that flat, Sonam Pawar, also happens to be the booth level officer (BLO) of Fatorda constituency’s part 27, but what has really raised red flags is that Pawar works at the Ravindra Bhavan where BJP candidate for Fatorda, Damodar Naik, is the chairman. Pawar, a resident of Building B of Lotus Enclave, works as a data entry operator at the Ravindra Bhavan. The building has 10 more flats, all of which belong to the Curtorim constituency. Goa Forward Party has dashed off a complaint to the chief election commissioner and other polling officials and has demanded a probe and corrective measures. Councillor for ward 23 of Margao Municipal Council, Nimesia Faleiro, said that Pawar, acting in her capacity as BLO, fraudulently included her family in Fatorda constituency along with a few other residents of Vidhyanagar. “Immediately conduct an inspection of this building Lotus Enclave Apartments and the entire Part 27 and delete the names fraudulently added and also take strict action against the BLO for having committed such fraud that undermines and compromises the integrity of the Election Commission in holding a free, fair and honest election procedure in the state,” said Faleiro. GFP has alleged that “malicious intent” is clearly visible in the constituency where the Pramod Sawant government is trying to favour the BJP candidate. “Why is only her house included in Fatorda?” said Fatorda MLA Vijai Sardesai. “And how come only she becomes the BLO of the part? One flat from within a building is in Fatorda while the rest of the building is in the Curtorim assembly segment, and a person living in that one flat is chosen as BLO.” Sardesai also said the state government is gearing up to file false criminal cases against him and Navelim Congress candidate Avertano Furtado.

In July last year, Israel’s defence ministry’s National Bureau for Counter Terror Financing announced that it had seized a number of digital wallets linked to Hamas. The ministry ordered freezing of the accounts after a joint operation with a cryptocurrency tracking firm uncovered a web of electronic wallets used by Hamas to raise funds. The list of accounts was shared with various countries, including India. Read AlsoDelhi: Probe points to Hamas link to crypto hackA five-month-long investigation by the Intelligence Fusion & Strategic Ops (IFSO) unit of Delhi Police’s Special Cell into hacking of a crypto-currency wallet has revealed that Palestinian militant outfit Hamas was behind the crime, sources say. Delhi Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana is likely toA few months ago, Delhi Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana asked the case to be probed on priority. A special team led by DCP KPS Malhotra was formed within the Intelligence Fusion and Strategic Ops unit of Special Cell to start a multi-angle probe. A few recipients of the stolen cryptocurrency were identified. One of the recipients matched with the one flagged by the foreign intelligence. The revelations left Indian security agencies alarmed as it meant that siphoned off money was being used in global terror financing. Hamas, blacklisted as a terror group by the US and the European Union, is known to be using cryptocurrencies, which are comparatively difficult to trace and offer some anonymity online, to raise funds and transfer them using a series of digital wallets. In the beginning of 2019, al-Qassam Brigades thorough its social media page sought Bitcoin donations to fund its terror campaign. It also made this request on its official websites. It gave video instructions on how to anonymously make donations. A report on the website of US Immigration & Customs Enforcement showed a crackdown was initiated on al-Qassam Brigades and its online cryptocurrency fundraising efforts in 2020. In December that year, the justice department, the department of homeland security and the treasury announced the dismantling of three terror financing campaigns involving al-Qassam Brigades, al-Qaeda and Islamic State.

They tracked and seized 150 cryptocurrency accounts that directly laundered funds for al-Qassam Brigades. Simultaneously, criminal search warrants relating to US-based donors were executed. Law enforcement also seized the infrastructure of the al-Qassam Brigades websites and the covertly operated alqassam.net. During the covert operation, while people thought they were providing material support to the terrorist organisation, they instead had transferred the funds to Bitcoin wallets controlled by the US. The details of these operations were shared with other countries for suitable action and strategy building.

---||Pune||As pandemic lingers, schools go to forgotten students in hour of need||Pune: At a time when learning is either offline, online or in the hybrid mode, children from some sections have had very poor access to education even in urban areas.Some NGOs and other groups, realising that it will be a huge setback for them, are going to slum pockets, children’s homes and other such places to assist in learning. Whether it is by playing or giving them gadgets for a short period of time to access daily classes or taking the help of volunteers from their own community to bridge the language gap, they are doing everything to keep such students in the mainstream of education and prevent dropping out. Safe Haven To Foster LearningWhen Covid-19 struck, the children of commercial sex workers were among the hardest hit sections of society. They were stuck inside dingy one-cot rooms, their mothers had no income and even two meals a day became a luxury, making education the least of concerns. “There is a lot of physical and psychological pressure on the women. With no work or money, they suffered terribly. Many mothers would end up beating up the kids. In such cases, we would counsel both the child and the mother. As for the students, their connection with school is almost lost. Hygiene has become a big issue so has discipline and concentration,” Naina Deshmukh, a staff at Swadhar IDWC, said.The centre provides a daycare facility for children of sex workers and cooked meals. During the pandemic, they gave them take-home ration kits. “We have two computers with an e-learning set up and our staff’s phones are given to groups of children to study during the time they are here. These phone numbers are given to the school teachers so they can add them to class wise WhatsApp groups and share the day’s lessons on the phone which is given to small groups of children for a specific time daily for their studies. This is a safe haven for them,” Sharayu Pandit, another staff member, said.The team is concerned about the rise in the number of children currently in the area. “Many women who had returned to their villages have brought back more women with them to work as sex workers. Many families have suffered financially during the pandemic leaving vulnerable women to turn to the cities for money. This means more children have come into the area. According to RTE Act, they have to be admitted in age appropriate classes. But they have studied in their respective mother tongues till now and here we have schooling in Marathi. Enrolling a child who only knows Bengali in a Marathi medium school in Std V is hard on the student. They lose interest in studies because they are unable to cope,” Suvarna Potphode, also a staff member, said.The NGO helps bring these children at par with their counterparts and has had many success stories, secretary of Swadhar IDWC Sanjivani Hingne said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/as-pandemic-lingers-schools-go-to-forgotten-students-in-hour-of-need/articleshow/89082000.cms||Ardhra Nair

Local women, who use the facility, had requested the police officials to patrol the area after sending the location using their cellphones. They cited incidents in which some locals youths had followed them to the public toilet. The Kondhwa police studied the spot and started regular patrolling. Following a similar public feedback-based approach, the Pune city police have included a new police patrolling facility on their My Safe Pune application. Earlier, they used to patrol vital installations, bus stands, railway stations, crowded places, market places, banks, ATMs kiosks and other critical spots. About three weeks ago, Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta urged people to suggest points of patrolling and why patrolling is required in that particular area. In the last two weeks, people have suggested as many as 300 spots of which 100 have been accepted by the police. This, according to them, will change the course of police patrolling in the city. Gupta told TOI, “We have floated a WhatsApp number and people are required to visit the spot where they need patrolling and should send their location on the WhatsApp messenger on the given number. They must provide an explanation to the police in two or three lines as to why they need patrolling at the spot.” After receiving the location from the citizens, a team of crime branch and local police station visit the spot, conduct a study and check the kind of crimes that have taken place in the vicinity. During spot visits, police check if it is really safe for the women to walk or travel, if there are street lights and if lumpen elements harass women pedestrians, or other local residents. “If the spot visit by the official proves that it requires patrolling as demanded, it is initiated immediately. This effort will also improve our patrolling and presence in the different parts of the city,” Gupta said. It is added to the patrolling list which is geo-tagged. “The application is GPS based and maintains records of the police visits. If no one visits a spot, the application flags it off,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/100-trouble-spots-pointed-out-by-citizens-under-vigil/articleshow/89082004.cms||Gitesh Shelke

All such properties will be auctioned if the defaulters do not pay the dues. “These property owners have been avoiding payment from a long time. Notices and warnings were sent. But they have not adhered to the guidelines. So, their properties have been attached,” Vilas Kanade, head of PMC’s property tax department, said. According to the civic official, before attaching the property, they issue notices or seal the property for a temporary period. But even after all this, if the payment is not made, the PMC takes the property into its possession and puts its name on 7/12 abstract, making it the owner. Civic officials said attachment was started in August 2020 after a number of opportunities were given to the property owners to clear their dues. PMC will start the process to auction these properties and may go online with it. Issues such as liability on the properties, bank loans and other financial details will have to be studied before the auction, officials said. Data show that civic areas have 12 lakh properties that have to pay tax of which 4.5 lakh are in the default list. PMC earns around Rs 1,200 to 1,300 crore per year through this tax. It has a target of Rs 2,000 crore for the 2021-22 fiscal. “PMC has started an amnesty scheme for tax defaulters, which offers discount in penalty. But many have not participated to clear the dues, leaving us with no option than to attach their properties,”a senior PMC official said. Property owners who pay the tax before May 31 get a 5% to 10% discount. This year too, the standing committee gave more time to citizens for paying the tax at the discounted rates. The deadline has been extended to June 30 in last two fiscals due to the pandemic. Property tax is charged based on the annual ratable value of the property.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/civic-body-attaches-3000-properties-over-tax-default/articleshow/89082008.cms||Prasad Kulkarni

The civic administration, too, has expressed its inability to supply water to these properties, leaving property owners in the lurch.The local residents said that they are suffering without any fault on their part. They said they bought flats hoping that they would get all the amenities. “Water is a basic necessity, but we are not getting it. The civic authorities should make sure that they resolve the problem and water reaches the merged villages. Pipelines and other facilities should be made available,” said Santosh Tathe, a resident of merged villages.According to the civic activists, the local self-governing authorities must take the responsibility of providing water. He said that the MRTP Act, which governs the functioning of these bodies, has no provision for putting the burden of municipal facilities on developers.According to residents, construction activity is booming in the merged villages. These areas are close to the city and there is ample vacant land. So, many big townships have come up in these areas.“The authorities are saying that private builders should provide water but setting up water supply infrastructure is not their responsibility. The civic body should not have taken the villages under their jurisdiction, if they do not have the capacity of meeting the needs of water supply. Now, the PMC should provide water,” said Amit Beldare, another resident of the merged villages. PMC has written a letter to PMRDA requesting it to take steps against developers who have not fulfilled their promise of water supply.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/conditional-water-supply-leaves-owners-in-the-lurch/articleshow/89082015.cms||---

He is struggling to save whatever is left of his agricultural land from being washed away by the Ganga, swollen by the recent rainfall in the region. Pal is a resident of one of the 25 critically endangered villages between Ravali and Balawali area from where the Ganga enters UP. Locals fear that one day the river will swallow their entire land, rendering them landless. Floods, an annual phenomenon, is the primary issue for the people of the district, criss-crossed by the Ganga and its tributaries like Kho, Ramganga, Malan, Baan, Chhoiya, Kho, Pili and Feeka. As many as 321 villages on the banks of these rivers have been identified as flood-prone. Of these, 148 are “badly affected”, 114 face “medium destruction” while 59 face “low damage”, as per irrigation department records. . Around 3,18,509 villagers are affected by floods every year. Bijendra Singh of Ravali village says every election, politicians descend on temporary helipads, promise to take steps to minimize the impact of floods and fly away. Be it Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav in 2012, Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2017 or chief minister Yogi Adityanath in 2019, none has fulfilled their demand to control floods, he adds. According to villagers, a Rs 61-crore project to install stone studs on the riverbanks sanctioned by the Yogi government five years ago is yet to take off as funds have not been allocated. This was confirmed by the executive engineer of the irrigation department Rakesh Kumar. When the irrigation department asked for Rs 2. 30 crore to carry out repairs of river embankments last year, only Rs 50 lakh was received.  Talking with TOI, Bijnor MLA and BJP candidate Suchi Chaudhary claimed, "Proposal to curb land erosion along Ganga has been sanctioned. I hope the funds will be released soon. Our government has installed a pontoon bridge across the Ganga to help farmers to fetch their crops." Her predecessor, Ruchi Veera, who is BSP candidate from the Bijnor seat, claimed that he had worked hard for the welfare of the people living along the river banks.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/poll-promise-to-curb-floods-washed-away-in-bijnor-district/articleshow/89082023.cms||Harveer Dabas

The mango and cashew season may get slightly delayed to some extent this year, as a result,” said agriculture director, Nevil Alfonso. He, however, maintained that the rainfall has not been continuous so as to cause serious damage to the crops. “The impact will not be very significant since it was only a short spell of rain. Had there been continuous rainfall, there would have been more impact,” he added. TOI had reported on Monday that short spells of light rain were experienced across Goa on Sunday owing to a trough like feature that occurred. With this rain, the possibility of increase incidence of hoppers is likely in the mango crop, while tea mosquito bugs are likely to effect the cashew crop. The two cash crops are already facing a late flowering season since it was delayed due to unseasonal rain this month. Consistent incidents of fog in the mornings for a prolonged period were also speculated to affect the cashew and mango fruit setting process. “Currently, there is a contrasting difference between the day and night temperatures wherein there is sudden exposure to heat in the day and cold at night. The cashew and mango flowers have been undergoing these extreme exposures leading to some of them drying. However, the sudden rain could further delay the fruition process,” a farmer from Sattari said. As a result, both the fruits will flower but its fruition may be delayed beyond the regular time which may affect production.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/unseasonal-rainfall-may-delay-mango-cashew-production/articleshow/89101368.cms||Nida Sayed

---||Goa||‘Comorbidity issues killed many, Covid incidental’||Panaji: Detection of Covid-19 infection in majority of the fatalities since the third wave has been “incidental” as patients reported life-endangering ailments. Many came after suffering a heart attack, stroke or other severities, with bleak chances of survival, and were found to have Covid due to the high infectivity of the Omicron variant, doctors say. It was also noted in several cases that patients having severe comorbidities sought medical help very late. “They died due to the severity of their ailment or other complications rather than of Covid infection, but such cases were termed as Covid deaths. Besides, the families of the deceased also insisted on the Covid test to claim government compensation,” said GMC dean and Covid hospital in-charge Dr S M Bandekar. The state pays compensation of Rs 2 lakh to families who have lost a member to Covid. The family is also entitled to an ex-gratia payment of Rs 50,000 if a member dies due to Covid. In the last two weeks, several people were either brought dead or died within a few hours of being hospitalised. “When a patient dies due to another ailment, there’s no need for a swab test, but families force us to do it and the toll rises,” he said. In the last two days, five people were declared brought dead to the hospital. Though Goa has witnessed growth in Covid infections, reporting a daily average of 3,000 cases for over a week, fatalities have been low as compared to the second wave. From one or two cases a day, fatalities rose but have so far have remained in the single digits. In the last four days, the daily average Covid toll has been 8.5. Bandekar also did not rule out the possibility of few deaths due to the Delta variant. “The third Covid wave is due to both Omicron and Delta,” he said. While other states are well aware of the variants that have been causing the spike, Goa does not have its own genomic sequencing facility and is still ignorant about the proportion in which the Omicron variant has been responsible for the steep rise in cases.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/comorbidity-issues-killed-many-covid-incidental/articleshow/89080924.cms||Bindiya Chari

The BJD is planning to take the help of technology for virtual campaign while also deciding to reach out to every household highlighting the developent work done by the state government. Senior BJD leader Atanu Sabyasachi Nayak said the opposition parties have nothing to talk about against the government and are only spreading lies. “People of Odisha have never accepted the opposition’s lies and they won’t accept this time as well. As directed by the chief minister, every BJD worker will now counter the opposition lies by highlighting the government’s plans and programmes,” said Nayak, a former minister. BJD insiders said the observers have been asked to camp in assigned districts to prepare the party’s campaign strategy, which will gain momentum after Tuesday. The ruling party is eyeing a win in over 80% of the 853 zilla parishad seats, which will go to polls in five phases from February 16. By doing so, the party plans to check the growth of the BJP in Odisha and to send a message that BJD is still the dominant force in the state’s politics. Naveen’s message to his party leaders, however, has not gone down well with the opposition. Briefing reporters here, senior BJP leader Pravati Parida said the ruling party can’t accept the facts because of which they are terming them as lies. “Is the Mahanga double murder case a lie? Is the Mamita Meher murder case a lie? Are the issues like crime against women, deteriorating law and order situation, plight of farmers because of poor mandi system false propaganda? The BJD doesn’t want to accept facts,” said Parida. Parida said the fact is that the state government is an anti-poor and anti-farmer. “Their only ambition is to remain in power by hook or crook. They think people will accept whatever they are saying. People this time will give a befitting reply to the ruling dispensation,” Parida added. Senior Congress MLA Santosh Singh Saluja said the Congress never believes in indulging in spreading lies.

The BJD is planning to take the help of technology for virtual campaign while also deciding to reach out to every household highlighting the developent work done by the state government. Senior BJD leader Atanu Sabyasachi Nayak said the opposition parties have nothing to talk about against the government and are only spreading lies. “People of Odisha have never accepted the opposition’s lies and they won’t accept this time as well. As directed by the chief minister, every BJD worker will now counter the opposition lies by highlighting the government’s plans and programmes,” said Nayak, a former minister. BJD insiders said the observers have been asked to camp in assigned districts to prepare the party’s campaign strategy, which will gain momentum after Tuesday. The ruling party is eyeing a win in over 80% of the 853 zilla parishad seats, which will go to polls in five phases from February 16. By doing so, the party plans to check the growth of the BJP in Odisha and to send a message that BJD is still the dominant force in the state’s politics. Naveen’s message to his party leaders, however, has not gone down well with the opposition. Briefing reporters here, senior BJP leader Pravati Parida said the ruling party can’t accept the facts because of which they are terming them as lies. “Is the Mahanga double murder case a lie? Is the Mamita Meher murder case a lie? Are the issues like crime against women, deteriorating law and order situation, plight of farmers because of poor mandi system false propaganda? The BJD doesn’t want to accept facts,” said Parida. Parida said the fact is that the state government is an anti-poor and anti-farmer. “Their only ambition is to remain in power by hook or crook. They think people will accept whatever they are saying. People this time will give a befitting reply to the ruling dispensation,” Parida added. Senior Congress MLA Santosh Singh Saluja said the Congress never believes in indulging in spreading lies. He said the party will highlight the real issues.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/bjd-outreach-to-counter-oppn-lies/articleshow/89082025.cms||Sujit kumar bisoyi

The officials said not a single nomination was filed for the post of sarpanch, samiti member and word member here until Friday, the last day for doing so.The panchayat has 13 wards with more than 3,500 voters.“A fresh notification will be issued by the district election officer for the three-tier rural polls. We will once again appeal to the villagers to participate in the democratic process,” Rabindra Nath Kanhar, block development officer (BDO)-cum-election officer of Khajuripada block, said.Several government officials, including the BDO, tehsildar, police and others had earlier tried to dissuade the villagers from persisting with their demand and urged them to vote. But the villagers wanted a written assurance from the state on the fulfilment of their demands, while the government officials expressed their inability to do so owing to the model code of conduct being in force.Gathered under the aegis of the Adasipada Aware Citizen Forum, the villagers decided to boycott the panchayat election.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/villagers-firm-on-no-network-no-vote/articleshow/89082028.cms||---

Teachers at the OUAT main campus sat on dharna in front of the office of the vice-chancellor. Association president Sanjay Kumar Mohanty said the OUAT was earlier following guidelines of the University Grants Commission (UGC) for direct recruitment and promotion (CAS) for teachers/scientists/ subject matter specialists of KVKs, associate professors, professors and deans. However, after 2020, the OUAT started following the guidelines of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR)/Agricultural Scientists Recruitment Board (ASRB) for direct recruitment and promotion. “The UGC guidelines were appropriate for us and we were getting promoted in time. But the ICAR guidelines are not up to the mark. The scientists who are working in the KVKs are facing difficulties to meet the ICAR criteria for CAS,” said Mohanty. He said they had started their protest from November 1 last year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/ouat-teachers-stir-on-hiring-enters-84th-day/articleshow/89082032.cms||Hemanta Pradhan
---||Bhubaneswar||Bhubaneswar: Cops sound alert on frauds under customer care garb||BHUBANESWAR: Here is a word of caution for those who turn to Google for every little thing, right from customer care numbers of products to those of companies. Police here said in many cases of cybercrime reported from various districts in the recent past, people were duped by fraudsters after they called up fake numbers that popped up on the search engine of the social media giant. “We have been receiving complaints of customer care service fraud involving various portals on Google. Cyber fraudsters have been posting their advertisements and listing them at the top of the search on Google to dupe people. They are ending up losing their money after calling up these fake numbers,” a senior crime branch official said. Experts said scammers are paying hefty money to Google to place their advertisements with fake numbers on top of the search engine. When gullible persons dial these numbers, the fraudsters pretend to be customer care executives and convince the victims to share their debit or credit card and PIN numbers. They even get the victims to install remote access applications on phones, enabling them to hack the device and steal vital data from the phone. In one instance, Jagabandhu Sahu, a resident of Tusara in Balangir district, lost Rs 1.78 lakh to cyber frauds after he took the help of Google to get distributorship contacts of a confectionery firm. On January 17, he lodged a complaint with the cybercrime and economic offences police station in Balangir. Sanjeeb Kumar Padhi of Sambalpur town also fell prey to such frauds while looking for ICICI Bank’s customer care number on Google. He lost Rs 1.03 lakh to fraudsters after dialling the fake customer care number to fix his mobile banking problem. He lodged a complaint with the cyber police station in Sambalpur on January 17. “Not everything found on Google’s search is genuine. The customer care numbers of products, companies and banks can be found on their genuine websites or apps. People should browse their websites,” Lalit Mohanty, a cybercrime expert, said. In most cases, fraudsters would ask the victims to download applications such as AnyDesk, TeamViewer, SMS to Phone and QuickSupport on their phones. Such applications enable remote access to a person’s mobile or computer device. This helps the crooks secretly view and access sensitive information such as bank account details, PIN and OTP.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/cops-sound-alert-on-frauds-under-customer-care-garb/articleshow/89082033.cms||Debabrata Mohapatra
---||Cuttack||Covid: Fresh demand to reopen schools in Odisha||BHUBANESWAR: With the daily Covid-19 case count expected to fall further in the coming days, parents and experts have urged the Odisha government to reopen schools. Though the state government has planned to resume online classroom teaching for primary classes, educationists doubted whether children will avail of its benefits. “Time to open schools as it is impacting the mental health of kids staying at home from the last two years. They are the future and should not be staying home for this long,” tweeted Parthiv Mehta, the parent of a school student, requesting the chief minister to consider reopening of schools. Following a surge in Covid-19 cases, driven by the Omicron variant of the coronavirus in the third wave of the pandemic, the Odisha government had decided to shut down offline classes for the students of classes 6 to 12 from January 5. Besides, the state had also postponed its decision to reopen primary classes on January 3, after a gap of 22 months, due to the fear of infection among children. “We were happy when the state announced to resume schools after almost 22 months. I had bought new uniforms and shoes for my daughters. But suddenly the cases started spiralling, postponing all the plans. Now when the daily cases have started dropping, we can hope that the government will consider reopening schools. When everything else is open, it is a torture on children that they remain inside for months,” said Pratima Senapati, a parent, whose daughters are in classes 7 and class 5. Experts have also been expressing concern over the academic loss of children due to prolonged closure of schools. “By keeping children at home, we are only causing harm to them. When the government can conduct elections, open malls and markets, how can we keep our children safe?” asked academician Pritish Acharya. In the past couple of days, the state’s daily caseload has been recording a drop from over 10,000 cases to around 8,000.  The All Odisha Parents Association has also urged the state government to consider reopening of schools, at least for students of classes 8 to 12.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/cuttack/fresh-demand-to-reopen-schools/articleshow/89087649.cms||Minati Singha

Stating that it was an act of sacrilege, they said that they would take the matter to Akal Takht, apart from taking the legal recourse to challenge the “rigged election”. Harmeet Singh Kalka was declared elected around midnight after the opposition members were taken out of the meeting hall and all the remaining 29 votes for polled for him.Addressing a press conference in Delhi, Sarna, his brother Harvinder Singh, and GK, said: “Akal Takht Jathedar was apparently asked to stay away from the meeting so that Shiromani Akali Dal could play the dirty tricks” They also alleged that former DSGMC president and now BJP leader Manjinder Singh Sirsa was also part of the plot.GK said it was the first ever election of DSGMC which was conducted in the absence of Guru Granth Sahib and Akal Takht Jathedar. “The extent of rigging of the election can be gauged from the fact that Paramjit Singh Sarna, who was candidate for the post of president was also pulled out of the meeting by Delhi Police, along with other members,” he said.“Even though Akal Takht Jathedar had not been taking any action against Badals but still we shall go to meet him and would take up the issue of DSGMC members calling the police in the presence of uGru Granth Sahib,” he said. Harvinder said, “The (BJP) government and official machinery should be beware of elements like Sirsa. Rules and maryada were flouted openly.”“Facing a certain defeat in the DSGMC executive elections if the process was carried out per law, the Badals plotted use of police force to wrest Delhi’s gurdwara administration. In a bizarre act of sacrilege, police then manhandled all elected members and threw them out of the gurdwara hall, in the presence of Sri Guru Granth Sahib, in order to allow Dhami and a handful of other Badal loyalists to rig the DSGMC executive voting,” he alleged.“None other than the chief of the SGPC was seen taking the lead to formally let an entire police force gate crash a gurdwara hall and go no-holds-barred inside,” he alleged.“Fraud began to unfold when Badal loyalist Sukhbir Singh Kalra made a public show of what was supposed to be a secret ballot,” Sarna alleged.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/sgpc-prez-part-of-plot-to-call-police-during-dsgmc-poll-say-sarna-gk/articleshow/89082038.cms||IP Singh
---||Chandigarh||Timing of ED raids suspect, but not giving clean chit to anyone: Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu||CHANDIGARH: While stating that he was not giving a clean chit to anyone on the Enforcement Directorate (ED) raids for illegal sand mining in the state even though the suspect timing pointed to political vendetta, Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu on Sunday projected 70 seats for his party in the upcoming assembly elections “provided a clear agenda is given to voters”. Replying to a question on the ED raids on the premises of a nephew of chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, Sidhu said, “The case is from 2018, and it was the then chief minister Amarinder Singh who did it. It has been four year since the FIR was registered. The ED is being brought before the assembly election. People have dubbed central agencies like the ED and the CBI as caged parrots in the past.” While questioning the timing of the ED raids, he added that he was not giving anyone clean chit. “Please don’t misunderstand me. I am not giving anyone a clean chit. Let the law take its own course. If you can prove a link, I will be the first one to criticise. But if you are doing political vendetta then I’m not with you because I know agencies like the ED and CBI have been used politically. Today, it is clear that it is a political vendetta.” Hinting at need to declare the CM face before the assembly polls, he said, “If the dochitee (ambivalence) is removed and a clear agenda is offered in the manifesto then (Congress will win) 70 seats.” Replying to a question about the possibility of a hung assembly, Sidhu said AAP was projected to win over 100 seats in the last elections and the surveys could not be taken seriously. “No matter how many parties are in the fray, it is the party that offers a convincing roadmap to resurrect the state that will be voted in. There is also the question of who will implement that roadmap. People will weigh everything and give a decisive verdict. Last time BJP offered me money to float a new party to divide votes. This time, people will not waste their vote on spent forces like Capt Amarinder,” he said. The PPCC president added that the 111-day stint of Channi government was only a trailer and the film was yet to come. “We will startle you,” he said. Sidhu said other parties like AAP too were facing rebellion over ticket distribution. “The party has the ‘one family, one ticket’ rule and it applied to Sidhu and CM Channi both. How can anyone get two tickets? It is necessary for me to react to everything,” he said. In a series of media interactions, Sidhu, however, justified the FIR against Akali leader Bikram Singh Majithia, adding that it started with an ED case against him. On the row over the PM's visit to Ferozepur, Sidhu said, “The PM is very dear to me but there can be differences.” He denied plans to leave Amritsar East seat for Patiala.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/timing-of-ed-raids-suspect-but-not-giving-clean-chit-to-anyone-sidhu/articleshow/89082039.cms||Vibhor Mohan

Though significant effect is not expected, the possibility of increased incidences of hoppers is likely in the mango crop, while tea mosquito bugs are likely to affect the cashew crop. There is also a possibility of increased incidences of white flies among coconut crop due to the sudden showers. Due to forecast of rainfall, farmers are advised to take precautions while drying harvested arecanuts. There is also a possibility of higher incidences of sucking pests among crops like beans, groundnuts, vegetables and watermelon.

---||---||Why Gandhis did not act against Punjab CM Charanjit Singh Channi, Raghav Chadha asks||CHANDIGARH: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Punjab affairs co-incharge Raghav Chadha on Sunday asked Congress president Sonia Gandhi and her son Rahul as to what stopped them from acting against then cabinet minister Charanjit Singh Channi when then chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh had filed a written complaint against him. Chadha alleged instead of taking an action against Channi, the Congress had made him chief minister of Punjab. The AAP Delhi MLA questioned the Congress leadership that not suspended Channi even after crores of rupees and many unaccounted property papers were seized from his relative in a raid by the directorate of enforcement (ED). Chaddha also raised the question whether the money of the sand mafia was reaching the top Congress leadership as well, and is that why they were refraining from taking action against Channi? The AAP functionary said Amarinder had made a statement saying that when he was the chief minister, he had asked Congress president to take an action against then minister Channi for his involvement in illegal mining in Chamkaur Sahib and the complaint was made in writing. Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) MLA Bikram Singh Majithia had also levelled serious allegations that there was a nexus of Channi, his relatives Honey and Money, and sand mafia was doing business worth crores of rupees. The AAP leader said that Majithia also alleged that Channi’s relatives are mining even in the forest department land where excavation was not allowed and also accused Channi of earning Rs 1,111 crore in 111 days. Chadha asked whether Channi would file a defamation case against Majithia too, like he has against AAP and its convenor Arvind Kejriwal. He claimed that a few weeks ago, the AAP had exposed sand mafia in Channi’s constituency Chamkaur Sahib and ED raids and recoveries had substantiated the allegations.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/punjab/news/why-gandhis-did-not-act-against-channi-aap-asks/articleshow/89086245.cms||---

After winning its last assembly seat in 1997, BSP failed to taste any electoral victory in the state during the last few elections, even as there was a strong sentiment amongst BSP cadres and supporters that the party should have an alliance for success. However, party supremo Mayawati would each time decide to go solo in the state where the party was formed. BSP cadres understood the electoral arithmetic, especially when the party was unable to grow beyond one caste — Ad-dharmi/Ravidasia in Punjab. The BSP once had the most committed and loyal cadre base in the state. Successive defeats would disappoint cadres, but they had the hope in their party’s potential which could have tilted the balance in case of an alliance. This is precisely the reason that electoral success is important to the party now when unexplored potential has been put to test after a pre-poll alliance with Shiromani Akali Dal. This time, there would be little room to take shelter behind the old argument of “but for an alliance”. After having tasted electoral success in alliances with Simranjit Singh Mann-led Akali Dal in 1989 and then Parkash Singh Badal-led Shiromani Akali Dal in 1996 parliamentary elections, BSP’s alliance with Congress in 1998 parliamentary elections failed to work as the Grand Old Party was quite unpopular at that time. While BSP bagged just one seat in 1989, it won all the three it contested in 1996. However, a lot has changed in the last 25 years, when it had an alliance with SAD (Badal). In 1989 and 1996, Sikhs had voted in large numbers for the SAD factions led by Mann and Badal, respectively, as they were angry with Congress. However, this time, the Badal-led Akali Dal is facing its own challenges, The party has to recover the base it lost in its core constituency — the Sikhs — during the 2012-17 term. BSP is also not the same anymore. Till 2002 assembly elections, the party was being anchored by founder Kanshi Ram himself, who had charisma and political knack and the party cadres were fresh and full of energy, dedication, and dreams. However, after the party did not forge any alliances and its vote share kept on plummeting in the subsequent elections, it is struggling hard to recover its base. Apart from the feeling among party cadres that they were not given a few of their best seats, what has impacted BSP adversely this time, is that Congress threw a spanner by appointing Charanjit Singh Channi as the chief minister, who comes from same caste background in which BSP has its core base. Though Kanshi Ram envisioned BSP as a party of Bahujans, and not just of Scheduled Castes, in Punjab it ended up becoming the party of Ad-dharmi/Ravidassia caste only. That also explains why the party could get stronger in those parts of the Doaba region where there was a strong Ad-dharmi population. That is also the reason why Channi’s elevation will go against BSP. When Kanshi Ram launched BSP, he took out a chunk of Congress’ support and for once weakened it in UP and Punjab. Now with Channi as the first SC Sikh CM, Congress is trying to get that share back. For BSP, it’s time to perform or perish.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/punjab/news/in-alliance-after-20-yrs-bsp-faces-do-or-die-test/articleshow/89086781.cms||IP Singh

---||Chandigarh||Day after viral video, FIR against Mustafa over speech||Patiala: A day after a video of former Punjab DGP Mohammad Mustafa allegedly making remarks on a community and giving threats to AAP workers went viral, police in Malerkotla on Sunday booked him on the charge of promoting disharmony, enmity and hatred between different groups on grounds of religion and race. Mustafa is the husband of Congress’s Malerkotla candidate and cabinet minister Razia Sultana. The case against Mustafa has been registered at Malerkotla City 1 police station (FIR NO.17) under sections 153 A of Indian Penal Code (Promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion race, place of birth or residence) and section 125 of The Representation of Peoples Act (Promoting enmity between classes in connection with election). SHO City 1 Malerkotla, Harjinder Singh, said that the case against Mustafa was registered based on the video and a probe had been initiated. In the FIR, police said in the viral video Mustafa, in all hatred, is seen addressing the gathering of Congress workers and the same can promote enmity and hatred between different groups. Police added the reality and authenticity of the viral video was being thoroughly investigated. Malerkotla SSP Ravjot Kaur said, “We have registered the case against the former DGP Mohammad Mustafa under sections of IPC and The Representation of People Act and initiated the probe in this matter. The police teams have been formed to conduct raids and carry out the further proceedings including Mustafa’s arrest”.Mustafa was served notice by the returning officer of Malerkotla on Friday after the rival party candidate of AAP Jamil Ur Rehman had lodged a complaint with the election officials in this matter. Rehman had claimed that Mustafa, having a habit of playing communal card, on Thursday late evening while campaigning for his wife and Congress candidate Razia Sultana had targeted a particular community and threatened AAP workers saying that he would beat them with a broom (also AAP election symbol) in their homes. Jasbir Singh, Malerkotla returning officer, said, “Mohammad Mustafa was served notice regarding that viral video clip on which he had replied and asked to provide him the CD of the video clip”. Replying to a query, Jasbir Singh said he would have to check if any action against the party candidate can be taken in such a case where the candidate’s family member had violated the model code of conduct.The row over his speech intensified on Saturday after BJP leaders also complained to the Election Commission of India and CEO Punjab while BJP leader Sambit Patra tweeted Mustafa’s video clip and hinted that Mustafa targeted a particular community. In another tweet, Sambit Patra asked the Congress party and its leaders to tell what kind of circumstance they (Congress) want to create in Punjab by using Mustafa.Replying to Sambit Patra’s tweet, Mustafa said, “Bloody lie “where is the Q of Hindus OR Muslims in this?. Incidentally it was all m affair from both sides, Jhadu and Cong”.In three more tweets, Mustafa tagged Sambit along with viral video clip and said, “@Sambitswaraj, Don’t look 4 your staple diet “hindu-musalman” into everything. unless your eardrums lie dysfunctional, stretch your ears to listen “fitnon”, not “hinduon”. “There was absolutely no Hindu-Muslim context to what happened in Malerkotla to which the quoted video clip relates. it was a verbal outburst unilaterally mischievously provoked by jhaduwalas, all Muslims. Your intended branding will not work on Mustafa as my nationalistic credentials are far superior to yours with a history of life long fight against enemies of india and destroyers of communal harmony in the state..”Mohd. Mustafa and Razia Sultana could not be contacted for comments despite repeated attempts.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/day-after-viral-video-fir-against-mustafa-over-speech/articleshow/89082045.cms||Bharat Khanna

AAP leader Darshan Bhagat, who contested as party candidate from the same seat in 2017, has already joined BJP. This development is expected to consolidate the Bhagat vote bank in support of BJP.  Both Mali and Darshan Bhagat were state vice-presidents of scheduled caste (SC) wing of AAP. Now, both have gone with the BJP after denial of ticket by AAP. They both belong to Bhagat community, which has a sizeable population in Jalandhar West. Bhagat and Ad-dharmi communities have the biggest presence among two SCs in the constituency and voting is also on caste lines. Congress MLA and candidate Sushil Rinku comes from Ad-dharmi/Ravidasia community. AAP candidate Sheetal Angural and BSP-Shiromani Akali Dal candidate Anil Kumar Minia also come from the same background.  Sources in BJP said two AAP leaders of the community supporting their candidate in Jalandhar West would help them consolidate votes of the Bhagat community. Ticket to Angural and then to former Congress leader Dinesh Dhall from Jalandhar North, two days after being inducted, led to a rebellion in AAP. AAP state party affairs co-incharge Raghav Chadha faced hooting from local workers a couple of weeks ago and a scuffle also took place between old workers and the supporters of a new entrant.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/punjab/news/in-jalandhar-west-bjp-gets-help-from-two-who-left-aap/articleshow/89086619.cms||IP Singh

Congress MLA and candidate Sushil Rinku comes from Ad-dharmi/Ravidasia community. AAP candidate Sheetal Angural and BSP-Shiromani Akali Dal candidate Anil Kumar Minia also come from the same background.  Sources in BJP said two AAP leaders of the community supporting their candidate in Jalandhar West would help them consolidate votes of the Bhagat community. Ticket to Angural and then to former Congress leader Dinesh Dhall from Jalandhar North, two days after being inducted, led to a rebellion in AAP. AAP state party affairs co-incharge Raghav Chadha faced hooting from local workers a couple of weeks ago and a scuffle also took place between old workers and the supporters of a new entrant.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/in-jalandhar-west-bjp-gets-help-from-two-who-left-aap/articleshow/89082050.cms||IP Singh
---||---||Punjab assembly elections: Candidate for Badal family seat not named||BATHINDA: The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) is repeating history by not declaring candidates from constituencies where members of Badal family are expected to contest, even as the filing of nominations will start from January 25. Ahead of the 2019 parliamentary polls too, SAD had declared its candidates for Ferozepur and Bathinda constituencies, from where SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal and wife Harsimrat Badal contested, respectively, after the filing of nominations had already started. Names of the duo were declared on April 23, while nominations had started on April 22 that year. This year, SAD has declared candidates for 95 of the 97 constituencies from where it will contest in alliance with Bahujan Samaj Party, which is contesting from the remaining 20 seats. Traditionally, former CM and SAD patriarch Parkash Singh Badal has been contesting from Lambi, but no name has been declared so far. Badal is down with Covid, but he is expected to contest from the seat. Badal has won the last five assembly polls from Lambi. In 2019, Harsimrat had been campaigning from Bathinda much before her name was announced.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/punjab/news/candidate-for-badal-family-seat-not-named/articleshow/89087604.cms||Neel Kamal

---||---||Punjab assembly elections: Sanyukt Samaj Morcha list of 8 includes BSP, Congress, AAP, SAD rebels||JALANDHAR/BATHINDA/LUDHIANA: A former Bahujan Samaj Party state unit president, another BSP rebel, a Congress zila parishad member, a former Aam Aadmi Party leader who resigned recently, and a Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) member belonging to Shiromani Akali Dal have figured in the list of eight candidates released by Sanyukt Samaj Morcha on Sunday. Five candidates are from Doaba. The party has announced Baba Chamkaur Singh from Bathinda Rural, Raj Kumar Mahal Khurd from Banga, Rashpal Singh Raju from Chabbewal, Khushi Ram from Phagwara, Jang Bahadur Singh from Garhshankar. The morcha also announced the name of Jaswant Singh Randhawa from Mukerian, Gora Singh from Bhadaur, and and Kuldeep Singh Dalla from Jagraon. Raju is a former BSP state chief. Khushi Ram, who had initially formed his own party, was the BSP candidate from Hoshiarpur in 2019 parliamentary elections. Both of them along with a few other leaders fell out with state BSP leadership over distribution of tickets with Shiromani Akali Dal. They were not opposed to the alliance, but to the quality of seats given to BSP and parted ways and formed Punjab BSP. Now, four of them, including Thekedar Bhagwan Das and Purshotam Ahir, have got SSM tickets.  Randhawa is a Congress leader and zila parishad member. He is leading the rebels who opposed sitting Congress MLA Indu Bala’s candidature. Khurd is a former AAP functuionary. After denial of ticket from AAP, he got it from SSM. Jang Bahadur had won as a rebel of SAD in 2011, but later re-joined the party. He is now with SSM. A senior member of a political party said on the condition of anonymity that the SSM was forced to look outside because it was “struggling to find candidates within who have contributed to any field”. The source said: “The morcha is behaving like any other political party” SSM general secretary Kanwalpreet Singh Pannu said the former BSP members had found favour for supporting the morcha in several constituencies.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/punjab/news/ssm-list-of-8-includes-bsp-cong-aap-sad-rebels/articleshow/89086553.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||AFT raps Army for denial of promotion to brigadier||CHANDIGARH: Coming down heavily on the Army for denial of promotion to a brigadier on the rank of major general into Judge Advocate General (JAG) branch (legal branch of the Army) despite the recommendation by the selection board, the armed forces tribunal (AFT) has held that such a gesture “breaches the trust between organisation like Indian Army and its officers.” “The act of the respondents (Army authorities) in not allowing the applicant to assume the charge of higher rank, despite being properly selected, without any rider, cannot be justified in any manner, as it breaches the trust between organisation like Indian Army and its officers which is not in the interest of organisation or the nation. One who serves the organisation with integrity, sincerity, and devotion also expects that her/his interests will not be unnecessarily sacrificed when it comes to promotion, without a valid reason. It is the duty of every organisation/institution to stand with its employees/officers with full support and to protect them, if deserved,” the AFT has observed. ‘Army can’t deny promotion to applicant for hypertension’AFT’s Lucknow bench, comprising Justice Umesh Chandra Srivastava, judicial member, and Vice Admiral Abhay Raghunath Karve, administrative member, passed these orders while directing the Army authorities to promote Brigadier Javed Iqbal on the rank of Major General at Army’s JAG branch in Delhi. A 1989 batch JAG officer, Brig Iqbal is presently working in the rank of Brigadier and posted as deputy JAG, Central Command, Headquarters Central Command, Lucknow (UP). While posted at Headquarters, Eastern Command, Kolkata, his annual medical examination was held on August 14, 2018, in which he was found suffering from primary hypertension and his medical category was downgraded to P2 (P) with COPE Coding C2O1P1E1, which is a non-promotable category in view of Army Order 9/2011 read with military secretary’s branch letter No 04548/MS Policy dated December 14, 2012, and Adjutant General’s Branch, Army HQ letter No 76086/Policy/DGMS-5A dated February 16, 2018. He was advised to take two drugs daily.  While posted at HQ Central Command, Lucknow, the Brigadier underwent Re-categorization Medical Board on February 12, 2021, where his blood pressure was found to be 140/90 mm/hg which was within the permissible parameters. However, his medical category remained unchanged which meant that he was unfit for posting in high altitude ar- eas between 9,000ft and 14,000ft, despite being fit in all other respects. He was advised to take one drug Telmisartan 40 mg twice daily. There are two posts of Major General — ₹Major General and Additional Major General (Litigation) in the JAG branch and both posts are tenable in New Delhi. Considering that one such post had fallen vacant, the No-1 Selection Board, which comprised Chief of the Army Staff and seven Army Commanders, recommended his name for promotion for Major General’s rank. However, despite that, he was not called to assume the charge of the higher rank. On checking, he was informed that he was being placed in the non-promotable category due to primary hypertension and he was not eligible for promotion, in view of the Military Secretary’s policy letter dated December 14, 2012. On the applicant’s request, the Army Chief ordered the re-constitution of a re-medical board, which on September 20, 2021, upgraded the brigadier’s medical category to SHAPE-I which is a promotable category. However, despite being upgraded when the applicant was not promoted to the next higher rank, he had approached the AFT. In his plea before the AFT, the applicant argued that he is a JAG officer whose duty is to give legal opinion and advice to the higher formation of the Indian Army. He is not an officer of the combat arms and services who may be posted in high-altitude areas between 9,000ft and 14,000ft. The post to which he is to be promoted is the highest rank in his Branch. It is located in New Delhi which is an area much below 9000ft. He has an unblemished record of 31 years and served the Indian Army with utmost sincerity, honesty, and hard work. Opposing his plea, the Army authorities, however, argued that in the Indian Army every selection, whether it be a case of fresh appointment or promotion, is done through a prescribed procedure under rules and is always subject to meeting medical criteria. If an individual in the Indian Army is selected for a higher post her/his selection always remains subject to medical fitness irrespective of her/his branch and she/he cannot claim exemption of medical fitness for any reason, the counsel for the Army had submitted. After hearing all the parties, the AFT held that the Army authorities cannot deny promotion to the applicant on the ground of disability of hypertension, more so, when he has controlled the ailment and his medical category has been upgraded to SHAPE-I in Re-medical Board held in September 2021. “The report cannot be discarded citing some discrepancies and quoting provisions of the Adjutant General's Branch letter dated February 16, 2018, more so, when the highest selection board in the Indian Army has already recommended the applicant for promotion to the higher rank knowing fully well the applicant’s disability,” observed the tribunal in its detailed order released last week.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/aft-raps-army-for-denial-of-promotion-to-brigadier/articleshow/89082056.cms||Ajay Sura

Police have booked 44 people in all. Those accused of using impersonators have claimed that they were unaware. One of the investigators said: "We had to confront them with the video and photographic evidence for them to confess. The actual candidates went to the physical test but sent someone else for the written examination."Last June, Haryana Staff Selection Commission (HSSC) had started the process of recruiting 5,500 general-duty male constables for the state police. The examinations were in Haryana during August but the answer key was leaked from Jammu and Kashmir. The Karnal, Kaithal and Hisar cops made close to 40 arrests. Then in December, the HSSC conducted the physical test of those who had cleared the written. Comparing the video images of the candidates in both tests, they found 102 instances of a mismatch. Based on internal investigation, the HSSC gave 44 names to the Panchkula police for booking and further action.Even as the physical test is over, some of the candidates disqualified for being short have doubted the measurement of height. HSSC chairman Bhopal Singh has promised them a re-examination of physical attributes if they are able to submit sufficient documentary proof of variation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/haryana-police-constable-recruitment-14-candidates-3-impersonators-held/articleshow/89082059.cms||Manvir Saini

Protesters also questioned about safety of common people.Sarma told mediapersons here, “Strict action will be taken if Assam Police are found guilty in the case. Certainly, the additional chief secretary will also hear the version of Assam Police.”He added, “Assam Police should act as friends of common people. This should be the role of Assam Police. They should play the role of saviour of innocent people. At the same time, they must be strict against criminals. But no question of tolerance arises if Assam Police becomes strict against innocent people.”The incident took place at Kachalukhua area in Nagaon on Saturday night when Kirti Kamal Bora, who was returning home from a pharmacy, intervened after he saw a few police personnel in plain-clothes beating up two persons and questioning them. Bora claimed that he could not recognise them as policemen. Bora alleged that he was thrashed by the police personnel, who were allegedly in an inebriated condition, and shot him on his knee.However, Nagaon SP Mishra said, “Police had to open fire on Bora in self-defence after he had attacked the police personnel with his helmet.” Congress leader Rakibul Hussain said, “If the victim’s version is 100% true, then the incident is an indication of a dangerous future.”Aasu general secretary Sankor Jyoti Baruah in a statement demanded a judicial inquiry into the case.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/himanta-orders-probe-into-nagaon-cop-firing/articleshow/89082060.cms||Mukut Das

The PLA has contacted their Indian counterpart, confirming that they have found a boy. However, it is yet to be ascertained whether he is Miram Taron, whose “abduction” has created a massive uproar in national politics ahead of Republic Day celebrations. “PLA has confirmed to their counterparts that they have found a boy, who is from the Indian side,” defence PRO based in Tezpur, Lt Col Harshvardhan Pandey, told TOI on Sunday. Even though the Indian Army or Union defence ministry has not officially divulged the details, sources in the Army said his handover will take some time according to protocol. “On the Arunachal side (India) of the LAC, there is no such information of any other person from India who went missing or was captured by the PLA of late. This boy, traced by the PLA, must be Miram Taron,” the source added. Earlier, Arunachal Pradesh chief minister Pema Khandu said the defence ministry activated diplomatic channels with China to locate and bring back Taron. PRO defence, Tezpur (Assam/Arunachal Pradesh), confirmed through its official Twitter handle on January 20 that PLA was contacted through the hotline for Taron’s return.

Compared to the first two Covid waves, the civic body’s systematic approach gained through experience is helping it to trace almost all positive cases in the third wave provided the residents have furnished the correct residential address or contact number.Since the onset of the pandemic, Trichy city has been outnumbering the rest of the district in fresh infections, hospitalisation and deaths. Contact tracing in the previous waves had come under criticism as people who tested positive in private labs were not traced properly. The city corporation has now improvised contact tracing approach. Test reports from private labs are collected at the earliest and the Covid control room contacts the individuals within 6-12 hours. While only about 90% of cases were reached in the second wave, the control room has managed to call all those who tested positive as of January 22, seeking their hospitalisation status. After inquiring about vaccination status, the severity of illness and travel history, the control room directs the positive cases to triage centres where medical officers examine the individuals. The city has four triage centres to check comorbidity, SpO2 level and symptoms to decide on allowing the individual to isolated at home. From making around 350 calls last week, the surge in infections has increased the calls made. In some cases, the operators with the control room were the first to inform the individuals that they had tested positive and the callers were trained to remain polite, officials said.“The systematic approach has helped us prevent improper self-medication and late presentation at hospitals. The control room will coordinate with health workers on the field to check the quarantine status of the home-isolated population too,” city health officer Dr M Yazhini told TOI. Compared to the second wave, furnishing of wrong contact information at RT-PCR testing centres has come down though it has not stopped. The health centres are asking for an Aadhaar card to note down the address. “We ask for the recent travel history of the positive cases to generate a report for follow-up. During the previous waves, people were rude to us, now they are cooperative,” S Vijayalakshmi, Covid control room worker said. The facility also helps in identifying public places and workplaces for rapid testing where bulk cases were reported. The corporation’s control room collates the positive case list data and submits it to the district Covid war room for further follow-up.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/trichy/trichy-corpns-covid-control-room-claims-it-traces-most-cases-in-city/articleshow/89080819.cms||Deepak Karthik

The constituency is represented by senior Congress leader Rakesh Pandey, who has won this seat six times since 1990s. In 2017, Pandey had won the seat by defeating the BJP candidate Parveen Bansal by more than 5,100 votes. Whereas Pandey had got 44,864 votes, his nearest rival Parveen Bansal had secured 39,732 votes. The then Lok Insaf Party (LIP) Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) alliance candidate Randhir Singh Sivia had finished third with 20136 votes. The independent candidate Madan Lal Bagga, who is now AAP’s candidate, had polled 12,136 votes. Political parties have been making tall claims about cleaning up of Buddha Nullah, but it has only remained on papers, with little progress being made in the project. Naresh Kumar of Chander Nagar, said, “There are many problem in the area, but the main issue is that of water logging and also the sewerage system remains blocked.” He added that roads are dug up and officials do not come to check it. Buddha Nullah is a major issue in the area, as toxic water seep into groundwater. Ashok Kumar from Saleem Tabri area, said, “We don’t have much against the Local MLA but civic related issues are to be looked after by MC and area councillors.” According to the data of 2017 elections, of the 1,81,931 voters in assembly segment, 1,24,557 votes were polled — a voting percentage of 68.46%.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/buddha-nullah-pollution-a-major-concern-for-voters/articleshow/89073091.cms||Shariq Majeed

Omnibus operators and truck owners have sought space for booking offices, waiting rooms for passengers, automobile workshops, spare parts outlets and retiring rooms at the integrated transport complex.It may be recalled that infrastructure projects such as Kallikudi market that was implemented allegedly without consulting the users have become a damp squib. To avoid that kind of situation, the authorities have asked the stakeholders to submit their demands as part of preparing the detailed project report (DPR). At a meeting organised by the district administration on Saturday, the Trichy District Omnibus Association has sought the facility to have space to handle at least 150 omnibuses at a time. “Similar to the Koyambedu omni bus stand, we need a separate terminus. Space for at least 50 offices for booking tickets, waiting halls and toilets for passengers are needed,” R Balasubramaniam, president, District Omnibus Association, said. A comprehensive design will prevent omnibuses from entering the city and causing bottlenecks. TNSTC officials were asked to submit written demands for their staff and passengers.

Forest officials said the cause of deaths is being investigated. According to the officials, they got an alert that carcasses of monkeys were lying on a vacant land and an agriculture field near the reserve forest at Nedungur village in Trichy district. A team of officials led by forest ranger Gopinath rushed to the spot and found 24 dead monkeys on the land. All of them were two years old. Initial investigations suggested that the deaths were not due to poisoning. They might have died due to suffocation, the forest ranger said. “The perpetrators might have confined the animals in a small cage leaving them dead. However, the actual reason of death will be known only after getting the postmortem report,” Gopinath said. Special teams have been formed to probe the incident and nab the culprits involved, officials said. After performing the postmortem, carcasses of all the 24 animals were buried inside the reserve forest range of Nedungur, forest officials said.

These districts still have a considerable number of young Ulfa sympathisers who are known as linkmen or overground activists. These operatives provide logistics and other support to the outfit and are even given the task by the militant outfit to carry out grenade or IED blasts during Independence Day and Republic Day celebrations. In 2004, the Ulfa had triggered a bomb explosion during the Independence Day parade at Dhemaji College resulting in the death of 18 people, mostly school children.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/security-beefed-up-in-upper-assam/articleshow/89082067.cms||---

Though Ratan Tata won’t be present at the event, he is deeply touched by the state government’s decision. “Thank you for understanding my inability to personally receive the award at the function to be held in Guwahati on January 24th and for your willingness to present it to me at a later date in Mumbai,” Tata wrote to Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma in a letter. “It would be a pleasure to meet you and our offices could work together to find a suitable date for such a meeting,” read the letter. Tata said he has been an admirer of Sarma’s personal commitment to the wellbeing of the Assamese people and called it an exceptional honour to receive the award from the chief minister.

Manipur will vote in two phases, February 27 and March 3, to elect 60 legislators — 40 in the valley districts and 20 in the hill districts. Among the 40, Congress named all its “current” 12 MLAs, including opposition leader and ex-CM Okram Ibobi Singh , CWC member Gaikhangham. Manipur PCC president N Loken Singh, K Ranjit Singh, TN Haokip, Thokchom Lokeshwar Singh, DD Thaisii, AK Mirabai Devi, K Meghachandra Singh, Surjakumar Okram, Fajur Rahim and Alfred Kanngam S Aurther. The grand old party said the second list, consisting 12 to 15 candidates, would be announced shortly. “We don’t see any big surprise nor any stunning figures in their (Congress) list of 40 candidates. Except for a few new names who we don’t consider big, others are as usual the old faces against whom we had fought in the previous assembly polls,” senior vice-president of Manipur’s BJP unit, N Nimbus Singh, told this reporter on Sunday. “BJP’s growing wave, good governance in Manipur and the people’s deep faith in our party will be key tools to defeat them (Congress) in the election battle. We don’t believe at all that their (Congress) claim of emerging as a single largest party. They may get a little less or more than 10 seats,” Nimbus added. The BJP leader siad of the Congress’s 40 names, most of them can be easily beaten by them (BJP) considering the diminishing trend of their (Congress) popularity and strength. The switching of over 10 Congress legislators to BJP since the last one year is a glaring example of their breakdown, Nimbus added. He said they believe the 20 seats for which the Congress would announce its candidates in the second phase in the next few days as “their weakest constituencies”. The 20 seats include Khurai, Thangmeiband, Saoglband, Keishamthong, Yaiskul, Wangkhei, Sekmai, Bishnupur, Moirnag, Thanga and Jiribam in the valley districts and Chandel, Tengnoupal, Mao, Tadubi, Kangpokpi, Tamenglong, Tipaimukh, Thanlon and Churachandpur in the hill districts. Of the 20, Yaiskul, Wangkhei, Sekmai, Moirang, Khurai, Churachandpur,Kangpokpi and Thanlon are represented by BJP legislators who won in the 2017 assemlby polls while MLAs representing Sagolband , Thanga, Tipaimukh and Chandel recently joined the saffron party. Last year, Manipur PCC president and senior Congress MLA Govindas Konthoujam representing Bishnupur seat resigned as legislative assembly member and Congress primarily member before joining BJP, while the Congress MLA who won from Tengnoupal constituency switched over to NPF. Senior Congress legislator Kh Joykishan Singh representing Thangmeiband seat was ousted by the MPCC on disciplinary charges a few weeks back, while the BJP MLA who won from Tamenglong seat had resigned from the party and legislative member during the 2020 poll crisis.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/imphal/no-surprises-bjp-on-cong-first-list-of-40-candidates/articleshow/89082069.cms||K Sarojkumar Sharma

The AICC on Saturday night released its first phase list of 40 candidates, including Ibobi Singh, for the polls and the second list of names will be out by Thursday. Though over 10 Congress legislators have switched over to its arch rival, the ruling BJP since the past one year, the remaining 12 party MLAs and all leaders are still working under Ibobi Singh’s supervision. “Tamo (elder brother ) Ibobi is still our undisputed leader. We will fight the ensuing February 27 and March 3 polls under his command and supervision,” Manipur PCC senior spokesperson Kh Debabrata Singh told this reporter on Sunday evening. Those Congress MLAs who left did not do so as a result of differences with Ibobi Singh but because of their selfishness and greed for power, he said. “Since he (Ibobi) is the CLP leader, he is also the natural chief ministerial candidate of the Congress party. In this position, he is the most competent candidate for the chief minister,” Debabrata said. “He (Ibobi) will lead the campaign and the whole poll strategy would be known after we release our election manifesto,” the Congress leader said. Congress will also release a “chargesheet” of the BJP government, highlighting the saffron party’s failed performances and promises. “There are numerous failed performances and failed promises they (BJP) made in referring to their earlier poll manifestos and public statements,” he said. “BJP’s claim of wining two-third majority and belittling our strength will be dismissed by the poll results. Whether Congress is weak or strong would be answered by the election results are declared. We still stand by our claim of emerging as the single largest party,” he said. Though there are high possibilities of many BJP aspirants joining Congress when they are tickets by their party, Congress will discuss threadbare whether they would be accommodated or not depending on the scenario of their respective seats. “We have our deep establishments in the 40 seats we announced yesterday. Among the 20 seats which we are yet to announce our candidates, we may not field our nominees in some of the seats if it helps defeat BJP,” Debabrata said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/imphal/tamo-ibobi-still-our-leader-manipur-pcc/articleshow/89082070.cms||K Sarojkumar Sharma

---||---||Uttar Pradesh elections: Denied ticket, Fatehabad BJP MLA joins SP||AGRA: Sitting BJP MLA from Fatehabad, Jitendra Verma, 41, quit and joined the Samajwadi Party on Sunday. Verma switched parties after he was denied a ticket to contest the upcoming assembly polls. He addressed his resignation letter to BJP state president Swatantra Dev Singh, and soon after leaving the saffron party was appointed the SP district president of Agra. This is not the first time that Verma has jumped ship. Ahead of the 2017 state elections, he had left the SP to join BJP. He fought the election on the latter's ticket and defeated the SP candidate by a margin of over 34,000 votes. Talking to TOI, Verma, who belongs to the Nishad community (a dominant voter base in Fatehabad), said, “I joined SP in the presence of party president Akhilesh Yadav. It is a homecoming for me. I have been given the crucial responsibility of being district president. I will ensure that SP wins all the nine assembly constituencies in the district.” Claiming that BJP workers and MLAs have "no say" in the party, Verma said, "There are many reasons why I left the BJP. Even 15 days after I was denied a ticket, the party leadership did not talk to me. I am sure that several MLAs will be leaving the BJP soon." BJP has fielded former two-term MLA Chotelal Verma, who also belongs to the Nishad community, from the Fatehabad seat. He is up against SP-RLD alliance's Brahmin candidate Roopali Dixit, who was also a contender for the BJP ticket but subsequently joined the SP. Meanwhile, reacting to the development, BJP's Agra district president Girraj Singh Kushwaha said, “Jitendra Verma did not formally raise any objection over the party decision. He was in touch with us and met deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma as well while campaigning. Unfortunately, he forgot that the BJP made him an MLA. He will soon regret his decision to join SP.” The BJP has denied tickets to five sitting MLAs in Agra out of a total of nine. In Etmadpur, BJP workers openly revolted and tendered resignations in protest against party candidate Dharmpal Singh. Similarly, the BJP candidate from Kheragarh, Bhagwan Singh Kushwaha, is also facing stiff opposition from party workers. Both Singh and Kushwaha are former BSP MLAs and had joined the BJP recently. On Friday, disgruntled BJP leader Digamber Singh Dhakrey filed a nomination as an independent candidate to contest elections from the Kheragarh seat. Earlier, former three-term BJP MP Prabhu Dayal Katheria resigned as the state vice-president of the party’s scheduled caste wing. His son, Arunkant Katheria, joined the Aam Aadmi Party and will be contesting elections from the Agra (rural) seat. Meanwhile, senior BJP leaders, including state president Singh, are trying to convince the seemingly displeased party workers to put their houses in order.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/denied-ticket-fatehabad-bjp-mla-joins-sp/articleshow/89100591.cms||Deepak Lavania
