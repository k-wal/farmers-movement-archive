Police said the chargesheet against Sajad Ahmad Dar of Shahgund in Bandipora’s Hajin was submitted at a local court. Dar is accused of operating a Twitter handle under the pseudonym Sajad Gull in which he uploads bogus anti-government news and posts. “Last year, he instigated residents against the revenue department’s anti-encroachment drive in his village. He stopped officials from discharging their duty,” a cop said. An FIR was registered against him following his resistance to the drive. He has also been accused of tweeting fake news about a recent anti-terrorism operation in Gund Jahangir of north Kashmir’s Baramulla district in which terrorist Imtiyaz Ahmad was killed. His tweets had allegedly incited the general public to protest against the security forces. Then again, when terrorist Saleem Parray was killed in Srinagar this January, Sajad is accused of uploading videos that purportedly showed the slain man’s women relatives shouting anti-India slogans in his native Hajin. In another case, an FIR was lodged at Kothi Bagh police station in Srinagar against Muzamil Ayub Thakur, a UK-based suspected mole of Pakistan’s ISI, following lawyer Syed Zeeshan’s complaint that he was inciting people through harmful social media remarks to commit offences against India. The Srinagar lawyer alleged that Ayub has been doing the ISI’s bidding and was involved in multiple cases of cybercrime against India.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/for-hate-tweets-against-govt-jk-man-charged/articleshow/88782032.cms||M Saleem Pandit

Road connectivity to Srinagar from Jammu and other areas of the Union Territory got affected due to the accumulation of snow as well as landslides and shooting stones at several spots along the 270km-long Jammu-Srinagar national highway, which remained shut. At least six IndiGo flights — five to Delhi and one to Jammu — as well as two Vistara flights to Delhi were cancelled while some flights were rescheduled. In view of continuous snowfall, most flights were unlikely to operate to and from Srinagar, said airport officials. Around 3ft of fresh snow has accumulated on either side of the Jawahar Tunnel since Friday evening. A Ramban district administration official said while about 3ft of snow accumulated at Jawahar Tunnel, around 2ft of snow gathered in adjoining areas of Banihal town. “It is still snowing heavily,” said the official. The Jammu-Poonch highway remained shut on Saturday due to heavy snowfall between Jaranwaligali and Bhimber Gali in Mendhar area of Poonch district, DTI Traffic (Poonch) Shoket Amin said. The Ramban-Gool road was also closed near Kanga due to a landslide. “BRO men are on the job. Please avoid travelling on this road today,” an official said. Mughal road, which connects Shopian with Poonch-Rajouri districts, Srinagar-Leh highway and Sinthan road, connecting Anantnag and Kishtwar districts, remained closed due to snow accumulation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/snowfall-hampers-flight-operations-at-srinagar-airport-10-flights-cancelled/articleshow/88782059.cms||M Saleem Pandit

They say their business is on the verge of closure because it is impossible to rustle up the expenditure for shop rentals, staff salaries, electricity bills and run home and hearth -- with the only source of income drying out completely. These trades are willing to observe all Covid norms as they have been doing since they reopened a few weeks ago. Covid-19 is here to stay, and vaccination and precaution is the answer not lockdown. Anita Mohan Salunke, who runs Plush Hema's Salon along SV Road, Khar, said, "The government must consider that it is middle class ladies like me who make up the largest number of beauticians in the city. The big chains are but a few. I trained and worked at a big salon, took a shop on a rent of Rs 1,65,000 and started my business although the amount was not my cup of tea. How will I survive, pay salaries, rent if we face another closure? My account is virtually zero balance. I have exhausted all my savings already." Lee Mein Yang who runs a beauty salon in Andheri Lokhandwala said, "I think they should at least allow us to work alternative days with strict rules and regulations applied, instead of closing all completely which will have a direct impact on the economy." Gyms are equally disturbed, yet continue to extend memberships for clients owing to repeat closure. Haami Basan of Planet Muscle gymnasium in Andheri West, said, "Business is at an all-time low what with prolonged shutdowns, monthly rent amounts of Rs 4-5 lakh, salaries, and overhead costs. We after all have to pay our electricity bills and staff salaries to keep the establishment going. Another closure will drive the final nail into the coffin for many gyms." Irfan Rangrez, owner of Gym Spirit, Andheri Lokhandwala Road, said, "To be honest I am not so happy with this closure as I believe Covid is no more a pandemic. It's endemic and we all should start focusing on our routine, food habits and specially on workouts as all these things are directly proportional to our well being. As far as Gym Spirit is concerned we take extreme care of our clients safety and follow all the Covid protocols religiously no matter what."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-gyms-salons-say-another-closure-sounds-death-knell-for-trade/articleshow/88782189.cms||Bella Jaisinghani
---||Mumbai||Live entertainment industry loses groove as gigs called off, musicians urge fans to stay safe||In light of the rapid spread of the Omicron variant, the unprecedented increase in the number of COVID positive cases in Mumbai, and the curbs set up by Maharashtra government to curtail its spread, most concerts, private gigs and stage events in the city stand cancelled or postponed. Live performances that had picked up quite well in the last quarter of 2021, have all quieted down to a large extent under the current circumstances in Mumbai, despite it being the season for live music shows, concerts, events, college festivals and wedding gigs. The Maharashtra government has banned large gatherings and also put restrictions on the number of people that can attend events. That apart, in the last few days, Mumbai’s singer-musician community has had multiple Covid-positive cases including Sonu Nigam, Vishal Dadlani, Shankar Mahadevan and others. While musicians agree that the situation is tough, they urge fans to mask up and stay safe, and also talk about how this current phase will impact the music industry, once again. It’s going to be difficult for artistes who depend on live concerts for their livelihood: Kavita KrishnamurtiKavita Krishnamurti shares, “All my engagements have been cancelled. Though concerts were beginning to start a couple of months ago, the pace was still slow compared to the pre-COVID scenario. It’s going to be very difficult for artistes who depend on live gigs for their livelihood. The situation is really bad now and I do hope that some organisations raise money for these artistes through online events and fundraisers.” These months are crucial because there are a lot of things happening: Salim Merchant“Just as we began to go back to normalcy, events started to get cancelled. But, this is something that we have to live with now. Musicians and performers have to work out a way to live and we have to work out an alternate way of life. The performance industry has really suffered in the last two years and it’s about to suffer some more now. These two to three months are crucial for us because there are a lot of weddings, concerts, college festivals that usually happen. The earnings of musicians, performers, people in the events industry, stage artistes are affected. Having said that, I’m still performing at some events and I feel grateful about that. These are small private gatherings and weddings in smaller cities,” the musician shares. Unpredictable is the new normal and we must adapt to that: Shalmali KholgadeShalmali Kholgade says, “I just got back from a holiday, ready to begin working again, but it looks like I will have to wait. Although I would have loved to get back to it, several of my shows are either cancelled or postponed. Unpredictable is the new normal and we must adapt to that as well, just like we’ve adapted to other things in the past. I’ve decided to focus my energies on completing my album.” It’s depressing and scary, but health is a priority: Mahalakshmi Iyer“It’s heart-breaking to see that just when we were all gearing up for a good season, events are getting cancelled or postponed. It’s both depressing and scary. But yes, health is a priority, so let’s hope we get through this quickly. Everyone please mask up and stay safe,” the singer urged. There’s loss of work due to the pandemic again, but we have to be patient: ArkoArko says, “I’ve just arrived in LA from Chicago after a music video shoot and judging a singing competition. My recording has been cancelled as my music producer and family tested positive. So, I understand the loss of work due to this pandemic again. But we have to be patient. A couple of years of difficulty will be forgotten in the long run, but we can’t afford to be ‘penny wise pound foolish’ by ignoring the health scare.” Since the last week things have gone quiet: Nikhita GandhiShe says, “It was exciting to start travelling again for concerts. Things were picking up in November 2021 and it felt incredible to be on the road. But, things have gone quiet again and almost everyone I know seems to be catching the new variant. I find myself feeling low quite often and it's counterproductive. There’s a lot of studio work to do from home, but the heart is hurting from all of this, making it hard to make music.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/live-entertainment-industry-loses-groove-as-gigs-called-off-musicians-urge-fans-to-stay-safe/articleshow/88760460.cms||Debarati S Sen

Punjab, Uttarakhand and Goa will have a single-day poll on February 14, while Manipur will vote in two phases on February 27 and March 3. Polling in UP — stretching over seven phases on February 10, 14, 20, 23, 27 and March 3 and 7 — will be followed closely as it has been the mainstay of BJP’s successive Lok Sabha majorities in 2014 and 2019 besides delivering a sweeping verdict for the saffron party in the 2017 state poll.

---||India||No physical rallies till January 15, poll staff to get booster dose||NEW DELHI: Taking note of the rising Covid graph, the Election Commission on Saturday announced a clutch of precautionary and proactive measures for the five poll-bound states, including a total ban on physical rallies, roadshows, car and bike rallies and processions till January 15. Chief election commissioner Sushil Chandra said that since nobody could accurately predict how the Omicron curve would behave, the EC would take a call after January 15 on whether to retain or relax the ban. The weekly positivity rate in the five states as on January 7 was still between 0.24% and 2.1%, though Goa was higher at 13% due to outsiders testing positive. Also, vaccination rates were improving with around 15 crore people across the states having got their first dose and 9 crore both the doses. However, UP and Punjab are witnessing a major surge with the average growth of active cases at 44% & 47%, respectively. The two states also have a low vaccination coverage. Explaining the ban till January 15, an EC functionary said the commission wanted to clamp down on gatherings at the “spreading stage” itself. With a study indicating that the third wave may peak by January-end or early February, the EC expects physical rallies to be possible by the time the campaign period starts on January 27. “Until then, parties and candidates are free to reach electors either virtually or through letters, pamphlets and posters. They can also do door-to-door campaigning in a group of not more than five people, including the candidate. Even nukkad sabhas can be held, though they will not be allowed on public roads, roundabouts or public corners,” said the EC functionary.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-physical-rallies-till-january-15-poll-staff-to-get-booster-dose/articleshow/88782977.cms||Bharti Jain
---||India||CCI set to probe Google's 'abuse of dominance' in news aggregation||NEW DELHI: Fair trade regulator CCI has ordered a probe against Google for its alleged abuse of dominant position in news aggregation to impose unfair conditions on news publishers. "In a well-functioning democracy, the critical role played by news media can't be undermined, and it needs to be ensured that digital gatekeeper firms do not abuse their dominant position to harm the competitive process of determining a fair distribution of revenue amongst all stakeholders," CCI said in a 21-page order. It added that the Commission is of prima facie view that Google has violated provisions of Section 4 of the Competition Act, 2002 which pertains to abuse of dominant position. The order came on a complaint filed by the Digital News Publishers Association, which is a private company that promotes and secures interest of digital news publishers. It had filed complaint against Alphabet Inc, Google LLC, Google India Private Ltd and Google Ireland Ltd."The allegations of the informant, when seen in this vertically integrated ecosystem operated by Google, makes it prima facie appear that news publishers have no choice but to accept the terms and conditions imposed by Google," CCI said on Friday. "Google appears to operate as a gateway between various news publishers on the one hand and news readers on the other. Another alternative for the news publisher is to forgo the traffic generated by Google for them, which would be unfavourable to their revenue generation," the watchdog said. The association said the majority of the traffic on news websites comes from online search engines and Google is claimed to be the most dominant search engine. It said that more than 50% of the total traffic on the news websites is routed through Google and being the dominant player, Google, by way of its algorithms, determines which news website gets discovered via search. Besides, Google is the major stakeholder in the digital advertising space and it unilaterally decides the amount to be paid to the publishers for the content created by them, as well as the terms on which the aforesaid amounts have to be paid. It further said the members of the association have to suffer a loss of advertising revenues and the inability to bargain a fair share in the value chain of news dissemination, despite working and generating credible news. Digital News Publishers Association said there is lack of transparency in online digital advertising intermediation services, which makes it difficult for publishers to audit and verify the ad revenue generated on their websites. "No doubt, Google, being the gateway, generates substantial traffic for news publishers, but at the same time, the bargaining power imbalance and denial of fair share in the advertising revenue, as alleged by the Informant, merit detailed probe," CCI said. As per the regulator, it needs to be examined if Google imposes any discriminatory condition or price on various news publishers. The regulator has directed its probe arm, the director general to probe the matter and submit a report within 60 days.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cci-set-to-probe-googles-abuse-of-dominance-in-news-aggregation/articleshow/88783076.cms||---

Hans will swap places with fellow IPS officer Narinder Bhargav, commandant of the 3 India Reserve Battalion based in Ludhiana. The SSP and 13 other officers, including the DGP, had been summoned on Friday by an MHA team that visited the flyover where the PM's cavalcade was stranded for around 20 minutes en route to Ferozepur because of a farmers' blockade. Barring the DGP, the summoned officials officials met the central team at the Ferozepur BSF sector headquarters. Parallel inquiries were instituted last Thursday into the alleged security breach that led to Modi skipping his scheduled BJP rally in Ferozepur - one by a three-member panel set up by the MHA and the other by a state government-appointed committee headed by a retired acting chief justice of the HC. The Supreme Court has since directed the registrar of the Punjab and Haryana HC to procure all relevant records of the PM's visit, and asked the state and central committees not to proceed with their inquiries till then. BKU (Krantikari) chief Surjit Singh Phool claimed the now-transferred Ferozepur SSP had asked the protesting farmers to clear the road, citing Modi's approaching convoy. "We thought it was a bluff just to get the road vacated," he said. Besides Hans, the officers transferred in the run-up to the poll schedule being declared on Saturday include Naunihal Singh, who has been appointed police commissioner of Jalandhar. AK Mittal has been posted as IGP, Roopnagar, while Sukhchain Singh has been named the new Amritsar police commissioner.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ssp-linked-to-pm-punjab-row-6-other-ips-officers-shunted/articleshow/88783111.cms||---

This was revealed to TOI by vice-chancellor Yogesh Singh on Saturday. The education ministry and National Testing Agency (NTA) are responsible for conducting the exams. This puts an end to speculation that the university may opt for its own entrance exams. A notification issued by the university on December 20, 2021, had said, "The executive council of the University of Delhi at its meeting held on 17th December 2021 resolved that the admissions for the Academic Session 2022-2023 onwards in all undergraduate courses...shall be made through Central University Common Entrance Test (CUCET) or Delhi University Common Entrance Test (DUCET)." "We are working on the project. We will soon be forming a committee to look into the whole process and coordinate with the ministry and NTA," said Singh. "Since the initial announcement, nothing much has happened on that front. The university is, perhaps, waiting for some directive or clarity from the ministry. With Covid cases going up again, just wondering how the ministry will do it," said a university official. According to the normal schedule, the admission process for the UG courses begins in April-May. It got delayed in the last two sessions because of Covid and the admission process took place in September-October. The university opted for entrance exams to counter the high cut-offs and the disproportionate number of admissions of students from some boards. The university had constituted a committee to study the admission patterns and it found that students from Kerala were dominating seats in popular colleges. Twelve central universities - none from Delhi - are part of CU-CET now. The exams have so far been held for 64 undergraduate and integrated courses run by these universities. There are multiple-choice based questions (MCQ) for BSc and BA courses. So far, no exams for commerce have been held but B.Com(H) and B.Com Programme are popular courses in DU. The question paper for BSc has two parts - Part A is English, general knowledge and numerical ability with 25 marks allotted while Part B is subject-specific, such as Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics and Biology, with another 25 marks. For BA/Diploma, essentially the humanities courses, its English, numerical aptitude/data interpretation, analytical skills, reasoning, general aptitude and general knowledge of 100 marks. After the entrance exams, each university releases its own merit list and conducts counselling. Teachers are divided over the decision to conduct exams. The critics feel it will promote the coaching culture which will ultimately deprive the students coming from the poorer sections of society.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/admissions-in-du-through-cu-cet-from-this-year-vice-chancellor-yogesh-singh/articleshow/88783148.cms||Shradha Chettri

The move will end a two-year restriction on the export of Indian mangoes to the US, which was earlier allowing imports but subsequently linked it to the export of Indian cherries and fodder. The decision to ease the rules was taken during a recent meeting between commerce minister Piyush Goyal and USTR Katherine Tai. On Saturday, the commerce department said that a framework agreement for implementing the "2 Vs 2 Agri market access issues" had been signed between the department of agriculture and farmer's welfare and US department of agriculture. "Mango and pomegranate exports will start from January-February 2022 and pomegranate aril exports from April 2022. Exports of Alfalfa hay and cherries from USA will begin in April 2022," an official statement said. Further, following the ministerial discussions, the department of animal husbandry and dairying is also ready to provide market access for US pork and has requested the American administration to share a signed copy of final sanitary certificate to finalize a deal.

As per the state health department bulletin, while 6,89,751 people were afflicted by Covid-19, 4,039 had died of the infection. Rahul Bojja, secretary of disaster management department, said they have received 26,000 applications till January 7. "The committees headed by district collectors have cleared 12,000 applications. The applications are being downloaded every Monday and scrutinised by the committees," Bojja told STOI. Of the 12,000 applications, the Hyderabad district administration has so far cleared 2,500. Officials said they received 4,000 to 5,000 applications in a day initially, but now they get 2,000 per day. All applications are being processed. Following the Supreme Court's directions and the Centre's guidelines, the state government invited applications from the kin of those who had died of Covid-19, promising that they will get a compensation of 50,000 each. Affected families have been asked to apply online through MeeSeva centres across the state. Explaining the reasons behind the mismatch between the number of Covid-19 deaths and the number of ex gratia applications received, Hyderabad district authorities said that ever since the guidelines for granting the compensation had been eased, a greater number of people had started applying for ex gratia. "The state government is not insisting on any medical certificate from the kin specifying that their family member had indeed died of Covid-19. The applicant has to submit the death certificate of the deceased, his or her Covid-19 positive report, Aadhaar numbers of the deceased and the applicant, plus bank details of the kin," Bojja explained. Officials recalled that several people had succumbed to the disease even before they were taken to a hospital or while being shifted to hospitals, which were not officially recorded. State health department officials said that the criteria for claiming ex gratia is that a person who had succumbed to Covid-19 should have died within one month after testing positive for the coronavirus. "There are, however, some exemptions if the hospitalisation stretches beyond one month," a senior health official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/t-pegs-covid-deaths-at-4k-but-26k-seek-compensation/articleshow/88783276.cms||Koride Mahesh

However, health officials fear that the infection may spread to the interiors of the state like in the previous two waves and these districts will follow Gurgaon and Faridabad over the next seven to 10 days.Haryana recorded a total of 3,541 new Covid cases on Saturday, that included 13,937 active cases. And Gurgaon and Faridabad collectively constitute 54.5% of these new cases, as per government statistics.Rewari, on the other hand, reported 27 new cases on January 7, which jumped to 53 on Saturday. The number of active cases in Rewari currently stands at 129. Health officials in Rewari said that after the second wave, they maintained a monthly average of testing 30,000 people, “which has so far helped them control the spread to some extent”.“We maintained our testing even after the second wave when all the districts were reporting fewer cases. The active surveillance has helped us till now,” said Dr Krishan Kumar, chief medical officer, Rewari. However, Dr Deepak Verma, deputy civil surgeon of Rewari, said, “The population of Rewari is just 10 lakh. That’s very less when compared to Gurgaon and Faridabad, the districts reporting the maximum number of cases. Although the number of Covid cases are less here, there is an increasing trend and the cases are bound to rise in the coming days.” Rewari tested 47,164 people in June, 43,229 in July, 38,138 in August, 30,004 in September, 28,920 in October, 30,451 in November and 47,626 in December. Rewari tested 12,450 samples from January 1 to January 7 this year.Similarly, Jhajjar reported 58 new cases of Covid and 167 active cases on January 7. On Saturday, Jhajjar added 73 new cases of Covid and increased the active cases to 225. “This time too, we are witnessing an increasing trend, however, it is slow. The local administration has put several restrictions, which has helped in limiting the number of cases only to some extent,” said Sanjay Dahiya, chief medical officer, Jhajjar. “Moreover, Gurgaon and Faridabad are witnessing a huge surge as a majority of international travellers are travelling to these two districts of the state.” Rohtak too had been reporting less than 100 Covid cases till January 7, however, the number of new cases increased twofold on Saturday when 110 new cases were added to the district’s caseload. The active cases have also gone up to 318. “Gurgaon and Faridabad too are practically an extension of Delhi. The infection this time is particularly from abroad through air travellers,” said Dr Dhruv Chaudhary, head, department of pulmonary and critical care medicine, PGIMS Rohtak. “However, in districts like Rohtak, Jhajjar and Rewari, cases have started picking up. The cases will spread to the interiors of the state, including these districts, in the next seven to 10 days.”Nuh too has been reporting fewer cases. The district reported 17 new cases on Saturday. “The reason for the lower number of cases in Nuh is that it’s predominantly a rural area and the residents don’t travel to and fro to the cities. We have also achieved 90% of our first dose and 30% of our second dose coverage,” said Dr Surinder Yadav, chief medical officer, Nuh.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/numbers-still-low-citys-neighbours-may-see-spike-in-cases-in-10-days-say-experts/articleshow/88783277.cms||Vishakha Chaman
---||Gurgaon||Active cases 6.6k, hospitalisations low||Gurgaon: The city reported 1,450 new cases of Covid-19 on Saturday, a dip of 22% compared to Friday’s 1,879. The number of active cases has risen to 6,642.The number of Covid patients in a hospital or healthcare facility also increased from 36 on Friday to 47 on Saturday. The current positivity rate is 12.5%. In the last 24 hours, 11,596 tests were conducted, of which 8,990 were RT-PCR tests. On Saturday, 164 people recovered.“The hospitalisation rate at present is less than 1% of the total active cases. A majority of the patients hospitalised have comorbidities. We have ramped up testing and are testing more than 11,000 people every day. We have also started cluster testing and are setting up camps at places reporting more cases,” chief medical officer Virender Yadav said.The health department and private health institutions, meanwhile, inoculated 34,668 people, including 10,296 aged between 15 and 17 years, on Saturday. Of them, 21,511 were in the 18-44 age group and the rest above 45 years. The number of first-dose recipients was 21,823, while 12,845 got their second doses.

Covishield will be available at 40 session sites, while five sites will administer jabs to those due for their second doses of Covaxin.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/active-cases-6-6k-hospitalisations-low/articleshow/88783278.cms||Vishakha Chaman
---||Gurgaon||EWS admissions in Haryana: Deadline now January 15||GURUGRAM: The directorate of school education has extended the January 7 deadline for admitting all eligible EWS students to January 15. This is the third extension in less than a fortnight. Over 40,000 students, who were found eligible to seek free education in private schools under the Rule 134A, have yet not been admitted. An education department official said, “We have been receiving complaints from the parents that schools are delaying the admission process. We have given multiple extensions but still, admissions are pending. We are preparing a report of all such schools and this will be sent to the directorate of school education. We will also ensure that admissions are given at the earliest." Parents have been gathering outside several private schools in the city demanding speedy admissions of their wards. Some of them have also formed a committee to represent their cause to the education department. “My daughter is in 3rd grade and she has been in a dilemma whether she should continue with the course of her current school or wait for admission in the one she was allotted in December after clearing the exam,” said Shiv Kumar, a parent. Schools claim that the EWS admission process comes with structural and procedural flaws and it will be wise to wait till the February 28 hearing of the case filed by private schools against the procedure in Punjab and Haryana high court. “The merit-cum-means approach is fraught with irregularities. CBSE bars us from admitting more than 40 students in a class, and the department forces us to admit 5-10 more in each section,” Col Kr Pratap Singh, district president of the Haryana Progressive Schools’ Conference, informed. Schools also assert that the timing of the admission is impractical and not feasible. “Final exams are round the corner and admitting students now is not in the interest of anybody,” Salwan Public School’s principal, Rashmi Malik said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/ews-admissions-deadline-now-jan-15/articleshow/88783279.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||Haryana: 24 buses on 45 routes to provide free shuttles to school-going girls in Nuh||GURUGRAM: The district administration, on Saturday, announced that the education department had identified 45 bus routes across five blocks in Nuh for providing free-of-cost pick-up-and-drop facilities to school-going girls. The administration, officials said, is now ready to resume the Balika Siksha Vahini scheme for girl students, put on hold due to the pandemic, with the district roadways department set to run 24 buses on the identified routes. “Haryana School Project Council had launched this initiative to further the government commitment to 'Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao' and prevent girls from dropping out of schools. The service, however, was put on hold for some time, and we had received requests to resume it,” said Nuh deputy commissioner Shakti Singh. The education and roadways departments carried out consultations to decide the bus routes. Till now, the scheme was only for school-going girls, but it will get clubbed with the higher education department project of providing free transportation for college-going women in the rural areas. On Friday, TOI reported that the education department and the Haryana roadways department, jointly, will roll out 550 buses for college-going women this month. All the buses will be accessible to both school and college-going students. “Over 40 routes will be serviced by 24 buses. Earlier, these buses got availed by the school-going girls, but now, even college-going women can use them. We have clubbed the routes for maximum utilisation of resources,” said a roadways department official. The district education department claimed that free transportation would prevent women from dropping out, particularly during secondary education. “Transportation challenges are one of the major reasons behind dropouts. The free bus service would improve the retention rate of girls at the school level but also help many women to continue higher studies in colleges far away from their villages,” said Nuh district elementary education officer Kapil Punia.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/24-buses-on-45-routes-to-provide-free-shuttles-to-school-going-girls-in-nuh/articleshow/88783280.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||Rain clears air, floods usual spots||Gurgaon: Residents of the city woke up to heavy downpour and thunderstorms on Saturday morning, which pushed the minimum temperature to 13.5 degrees — six notches above the normal. However, the winter showers brought down the maximum temperature to 16.8 degrees, three notches below the normal. The showers also helped improve the city’s air quality.In fact, what began as overnight intermittent showers increased in intensity around 5am, accompanied by thunderstorms, and continued till 8.30am. This was followed by light drizzle till noon. And like previous instances, there was waterlogging in areas such as near MG Road metro station, IFFCO Chowk, Basai Chowk, Subhash Chowk and Tau Devilal Stadium. Light rain and fog are expected on Sunday.“The western disturbance lies over northern Pakistan and neighbourhood while the induced cyclonic circulation lies over eastern Rajasthan and neighbourhood at lower tropospheric levels, triggering rain in the region. There is a possibility of drizzle and light rain at isolated pockets of the city on Sunday as well,” said an Indian Meteorological Department official.According to the official, the city may experience moderate to dense fog from Sunday. “There will be a slight fall in the minimum temperature in the next 24 hours but a significant decline by 4-6 degree Celsius with the change in wind direction from south-easterlies to icy cold north-westerlies in the next 2-3 days,” he said.Till 5.30pm, the city recorded 59.4 mm of rainfall. According to the data of the district administration, Sohna recorded the highest 91 mm rainfall, followed by Kadipur (64), Harsaru (64), Wazirabad (59), Badshapur (64) and Manesar (66).Being a weekend and with the lockdown prevailing in neighbouring Delhi, there was little rush on the road on Saturday. However, many areas saw waterlogging. Prashant Chouhan, RWA president of Sector-9, said, “Every time there is rain, the city’s infrastructure crumbles. It is not even the monsoon season but winter rain is enough to cause waterlogging in the city.”When contacted, Pradeep Kumar, chief engineer of GMDA, said, “There is an ongoing sewer cleaning work from Signature Tower to Sohna road, for which we have plugged a pipeline temporarily, and there’s construction activity going on at Subhash Chowk by NHAI, which led to waterlogging.”“However, at most places water itself receded once the rain stopped. Tendering process for the construction of a master drain between Umang Bhradwaj Chowk and Basai Chowk has been completed and we are working to complete it before the coming monsoon to address the waterlogging problem,” he added.Meanwhile, the AQI in the city further improved but remained in the moderate category for the second consecutive day as the rains helped wash away the pollutants. The overall AQI was recorded at 106, better from Friday’s 149. “However, the air quality is likely to deteriorate with a dip in temperature and low wind speed,” the IMD official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/rain-clears-air-floods-usual-spots/articleshow/88783281.cms||Akanksha Gupta

---||Noida||Gautam Budh Nagar: CCTV cameras, QR code scanners to check illicit liquor sales from April 1||GREATER NOIDA: The excise department, which rolled out the process of licence renewal for the over 500 liquor vends in Gautam Budh Nagar on Saturday, is set to implement a host of new measures under the state government’s latest excise policy aimed at creating “virtual perimeters” around such shops from April 1. Under it, all 532 liquor vends across the district, will have to install closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras and install a track-and-trace system, including keeping point-of-sale(POS) machines and QR code scanners, to upload the details of the stock sold per day on a centralised system, officials said. The process of “geo-fencing” the shops selling country-made liquor (231), foreign liquor (139), beer shops (137) and model shops (25) in the district aims at enhancing transparency, stemming illicit sale and tracking the demand and supply in the region, the department said. Officials, meanwhile, told TOI that they have already achieved Rs 916 crore of the Rs 1,044-crore target till December 31 last year. “The renewal of shops, which will continue till March 9, will further bring in revenue for us in the coming weeks,” district excise officer RB Singh said, adding that the department was looking to raise more than Rs 118 crore through licence fees. Till December 31 last year, the revenue of the department was 38% higher compared to the previous fiscal, the official said. While the excise policy for the 2022-23 fiscal remains largely unchanged, entrepreneurs who entered the premium retail business have expressed apprehension over the hike in annual licence fees for such vends from Rs 12 lakh Rs 20 lakh. Shiva Kaushik, a co-partner of a store at Sector 74’s Supertech North Eye, said, “We are going to get the licence again. Even though our margin will come down and it will be difficult to break even, our customer base has grown significantly and we will be able to cover up in some time.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/cctv-cameras-qr-code-scanners-to-check-illicit-liquor-sales-from-april-1/articleshow/88783285.cms||---
---||Ghaziabad||What impact will Covid, farm stir have? NCR cities vote in Phase 1||NOIDA: Among the districts first off the mark as the seven-phase UP assembly election gets under way on February 10 from the state’s western districts will be Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar. The immediate challenge for candidates vying for the assembly seats will be to widen their reach among voters because no election rallies are allowed till January 15. The stakes this time are very high for the ruling BJP, which came to office in 2017 after a gap of more than 15 years. All the three assembly constituencies in Gautam Budh Nagar (Noida, Dadri and Jewar) were bagged by BJP last time by a comfortable margin. Though the turnout was 48% in Noida, the most urban pocket in the district, Union home minister Rajnath Singh’s son Pankaj Singh managed to defeat Samajwadi Party’s Sunil Choudhary by a margin of over 1 lakh votes. This time too, the party appears to be on a strong footing in a region where Congress, Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party will all be keen to improve their performance. President of the Federation of RWAs in Noida, Yogendra Sharma, who joined Samajwadi Party on December 12 last year, and is vying for a ticket, said, “I am aware about the issues of the residents who stay in Noida. I am going to work towards improving civic facilities and urban services further for them.” Similarly, Ramkumar Tanwar and Pankhuri Pathak are vying for tickets from Congress from the Noida seat. The biggest issue for urban voters is housing. Residents of several group housing societies in Noida and Greater Noida have announced they are going to abstain from voting in the assembly polls. The problem is acute in Greater Noida (west) that falls in Dadri region and registry is not being allowed for a majority of projects on account of non-payment of dues. Besides, the impact of two years of the pandemic and a year of protest by farmers have also contributed to altered ground realities. General secretary of the Noida Extension Flat Owners’ Welfare Association, Shweta Bharti, said, “Despite making payments, buyers have been waiting for more than a decade to get possession of their flats or for registration of their units. What is the point of participating in the election when elected representatives fail to sort out the legacy issues of voters?” In Ghaziabad too, BJP appears to hold the edge despite the anti-incumbency factor and the year-long farm protests, the principal reason being the absence of a cohesive opposition in the district. In the last assembly election, BJP bagged all five seats. However, the Bahujan Samaj Party emerged second in four out of the five assembly constituencies and Congress in the other one. UP minister of state for health Atul Garg’s influence in the trader community may hold him in good stead this time in Ghaziabad city, though he came in for criticism during the second Covid wave for the manner it was handled. Last time, he won the Ghaziabad assembly seat by a margin of 70,505 votes, with over 55% of the vote share. In Loni, incumbent MLA Nand Kishor Gurjar is vying for a BJP ticket, despite having taken a stand many a time against the party’s decisions. He first embarrassed his party in 2017 when he stood up against the Yogi Adityanath government and staged a protest in the assembly against the speaker for not allowing him to speak in the House. A year later, he was issued a show-cause notice for making an anti-party statement. Nand Kishor won the Loni seat in 2017, trouncing his nearest rival, Zakir Ali of BSP, by a margin of over 42,000 votes. He could contest as an independent if denied a party ticket. In Muradnagar, BJP MLA Ajit Pal Tyagi bagged 55.7% of the votes last time. The Sahibabad seat, which is one of the biggest assembly constituencies in the country, was won by Sunil Kumar Sharma of BJP, who got 62.1% of votes while his nearest rival Amarpal managed only 26.5%. Amarpal is an accused in the murder of BJP leader Gajendra Bhati in 2017. What could work against Sharma is the grouses of residents of condominiums. Manju Shiwach of BJP won the Modinagar seat in 2017 bagging 50.5% votes. A newcomer to the field then, it will be a test of her political acumen if she gets the ticket again this elections.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ghaziabad/what-impact-will-covid-farm-stir-have-ncr-cities-vote-in-phase-1/articleshow/88784888.cms||Abhijay Jha

---||Noida||Businessman sends staff to get food, shoots self in cabin in Noida||NOIDA: A 30-year-old man shot himself with a country-made pistol in his office in Sector 63 of Noida on Friday evening. An initial police investigation has revealed that the man was allegedly in a financial crisis. Police have identified the man as Raj Singh, the owner of a courier company, Godspeed Express. No suicide note has been recovered from the spot, they said. “We received a call on 112 (the emergency helpline number), and the caller, a worker at the courier company, informed us about the incident. A team rushed to the spot and found Singh lying in a pool of blood. The body was taken into custody and sent for post mortem,” said Elamaran G, additional deputy commissioner of police (central). He added that a forensic team also reached the spot and collected evidence from Singh's cabin. “We did not find any suicide note but recovered the pistol used in the suicide from the spot. Additionally, we are scanning the CCTV cameras in the surroundings,” he said. After questioning the company employees, police found out that Singh had sent one of his employees to pick up food while he sat in his office and drank alcohol. “The suicide came to light when the employee reached the office with the food. He saw Singh lying in his chair, bleeding. We later recovered the liquor bottles, along with a glass. Singh was married and had two children. He hailed from Badaun district but was living with his family in the Supertech Ecovillage 1 society in the Bisrakh area,” the ADCP said. Initial investigation has revealed that Singh had opened the courier company two years ago and was in a financial crisis. “The company had suffered a big loss, and Singh had borrowed a huge amount of money from people. We are speaking to his family members and questioning the employees and others in this regard," a senior police officer said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/bizman-sends-staff-to-get-food-shoots-self-in-cabin/articleshow/88783287.cms||---
---||Noida||GNIDA improves its finances with recoveries, schemes||GREATER NOIDA: The Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority (GNIDA), which had a financial debt to various banks of about Rs 7,000 crore till 2017, has reduced it by Rs 2,587 crore over the last three financial years. The financial health of development bodies in Gautam Budh Nagar, mainly Noida Authority and GNIDA, has been under stress because of large dues accrued by realtors against land allotment. The Greater Noida authority said it had managed to recover Rs 1,874 crore from defaulters as premium for allotted properties, including additional receipts, and its revenues had been bolstered by sale of properties in allotment schemes that netted Rs 315 crore alone from industrial investments in the current financial year. “In the last three years, the authority has become financially stronger despite the corona crisis. This is confirmed by the fact that the debt of the GNIDA has come down by almost Rs 2,600 crore while we have also spent a lot on various projects during the same period,” said GNIDA CEO Narendra Bhooshan. “In industrial investments, the authority has set a new record. For the first time in the current financial year and with three months still to go, it has earned Rs 315 crore through industrial investments alone,” Bhooshan told TOI. Earlier this week, Bhooshan reviewed the GNIDA balance sheet. “The GNIDA now has a debt of about Rs 4,413 crore. If the dues are received from builders, which owe a bulk of the amount, then the authority will not only repay its loan, but the bank balance will also get better,” Bhooshan added. Ravindra Singh of Greater Noida authority’s finance department said the top two revenue earners were industrial allotments and commercial allotments (Rs 209 crore).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/gnida-improves-its-finances-with-recoveries-schemes/articleshow/88783288.cms||Meenakshi Sinha

---||Mumbai||Covid-19: 11pm-5am curfew in Maharashtra, eateries to shut at 10pm, gyms closed||MUMBAI: Faced with the Omicron wave, the Maharashtra government has introduced measured curbs aimed at controlling crowds and pushing for vaccinations, but sparing the economic engine. The restrictions, which will come into force on Monday, include a night curfew from 11pm to 5am where moving out is allowed only for essential purposes. Also, no movement will be allowed in groups of five or more people from 5am to 11pm. Gyms, beauty salons, spas, swimming pools and wellness centres will be shut. However, hair-cutting salons are allowed to operate at 50% capacity, though they must close between 10 pm and 7 am. Entertainment parks, zoos, museums, forts and tourist spots will be closed. Schools and colleges in the state have to remain closed till February 15. BMC chief Iqbal Chahal said the restrictions will apply to Mumbai as they are. The state government has allowed malls, markets and restaurants to operate at 50% capacity. Cinemas and drama theatres have also been allowed 50% capacity. The only riders are that those entering have to be fully vaccinated and that all these establishments have to close between 10 pm and 8 am. Private offices have been advised to keep attendance at 50% and offer flexible and staggered timings to keep crowding down. Government offices will not be allowed visitors without the permission of the head of the office. "We don't want to shut down livelihoods but to curtail crowds. We do not want to impose a lockdown and close down everything," said chief minister Uddhav Thackeray in a statement. "But no restrictions will be effective unless we all adhere to Covid protocols," he added. The new notification gets tougher on vaccinations. Although construction and industrial activities as well as cargo transport activities are allowed, these are only for the fully vaccinated. Only fully vaccinated people can attend private offices. Also, besides those working in malls and restaurants, now people engaged in e-commerce and home delivery have to be fully vaccinated as well. Additional restrictions can be enforced separately for districts with low vaccination coverage. Those in the gym and beauty parlour trade are upset. Anita Mohan Salunke, who runs Plush Hema's Salon in Khar, said, "It is middle-class ladies like me who make up the largest number of beauticians in the city. The big chains are but a few. I trained and worked at a big salon, took a shop on a rent of Rs 1.65 lakh and started my business. How will I survive if we face another closure?" Haami Basan of Planet Muscle gymnasium in Andheri West, said, "Another closure will drive the final nail into the coffin for many gyms. Business is at an all-time low with prolonged shutdowns, monthly rent amounts of Rs 4-5 lakh, salaries and overhead costs." Restaurants had been allowed to revert to pre-pandemic timings in November 2021, and the trade is hopeful the timings will be extended once again. "In Mumbai we had been allowed to stay open till 1.30 am. Now it's back to 10 pm. We support the government in the fight against Covid but we hope timings are extended once again," said Shivanand Shetty, president of the Indian Hotels and Restaurant Association.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/11pm-5am-curfew-in-state-eateries-to-shut-at-10pm-gyms-closed/articleshow/88783292.cms||Bella Jaisinghani
---||Mumbai||After 13 days of spike, 3% drop in new Covid cases in Mumbai||MUMBAI: After 13 straight days of increase in daily detections, Mumbai registered a 3% drop in new cases on Saturday. It reported 20,318 fresh cases, a fall from 20,971 the previous day. Experts are perplexed as a peak or plateauing was expected only by mid-January. Some have attributed the slowdown to saturation in testing, or higher number of unreported self-tests, and think the next few days will provide a clearer picture. Meanwhile, the state added 41,434 new cases, an increase of 504 (1.2%) from the previous day's 40,925. Despite the slight drop in cases, Saturday was still the third day of the city clocking over 20,000 cases. The negative growth in Mumbai's daily detection rate has also put brakes on the state's daily Covid graph that grew by 36.6% on Thursday and 12% on Friday. BMC chief I S Chahal told TOI that Mumbai's cases might be stabilising since it was the third day of reporting 20,000 cases. "But we have to wait and watch the trend," he said. Comparing the occupancy of critical beds between the two waves, Ashwini Bhide, additional municipal commissioner, cited that when Mumbai had 91,108 active cases during the peak of the Delta wave, 85% of the 9,946 oxygen beds and 96% ICU beds were taken. In the current wave, 27% of oxygen beds and 30% of ICU beds are occupied. She said there was no cause for panic, but caution was needed. Deaths in the state and the city came down. Maharashtra reported 13 fatalities, taking the total toll to 1,41,627, while Mumbai reported five deaths, pushing the total deaths to 16,399. Active cases in Mumbai touched one lakh (1,06,037), a mark it had never crossed in the previous two waves. The count of daily hospitalisations, however, declined by 10% compared to the previous day. Civic data showed that 1,257 out of the 20,318 new cases required hospital admission, compared to 1,395 admissions the previous day. 108 patients had to be put on oxygen support. Currently, 7,234 beds out of 33,803 (21.4%) are occupied. Mumbai's positivity rate, however, hovered around 28%. A state official said it was a sign that the city needed to carry out more tests. "The positivity rate should be down to 10%," the official said. For the third day in a row, there were a huge number of recoveries in the state (9,671) and city (6,003). The state's cumulative Covid-19 tally has reached 68,75,656, including 8,93,048 cases in Mumbai. Epidemiologists had previously told TOI that a drop in testing of asymptomatics as per the national policy could bring down the number of tests as well as cases. BMC data showed that the share of asymptomatic patients was 82% on Saturday, down from 85% on Friday and 85% on Thursday. Dr Om Srivastava, a member of the Covid task force, said that whether restrictions have played a role in slowing down cases will also be known in some time. "We may also see a sudden spike again, so we must be alert," he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/after-13-days-of-spike-3-drop-in-new-cases-in-city/articleshow/88783294.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The petitioner urged the Bombay high court to direct the state to preserve documents related to the subject to fix accountability.The petitioner, Datta Mane, has said that state continues with Sanjay Pandey as acting DGP despite the fact that Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) panel recommended the name of three IPS officers — Hemant Nagrale, Rajnish Seth and K Venkatesham — to the state which needed to select one of them as DGP. The petitioner cited a TOI news article to support his claim. The article reads that ‘Maharashtra govt may stick with DGP Sanjay Pandey till he retires [June 2022]’Responding to the public interest litigation, an official said, “After a November 1 meeting, the state government had pointed out to UPSC an error in their judging the record of Pandey. Immediately after the meeting, the government had asked that meeting be reconvened. Later after receiving the minutes, the state government once again represented asking UPSC to reconvene as some material facts were wrongly considered and have since been changed. Moreover, we don’t know the locus standi of the petitioner to file a public interest litigation in this matter.” In 2018, while providing clarity in Prakash Singh versus Union of India verdict of 2006 on police reform, the Supreme Court said that “None of the states shall ever conceive of the idea of appointing any person on the post of Director General of Police on an acting basis for there is no concept of acting Director General of Police as per the decision in Prakash Singh’s case.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/pil-filed-in-hc-on-delay-to-appoint-state-top-cop/articleshow/88783297.cms||Vijay V Singh

Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut said the party hopes to stitch a Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) in Goa. “It is a matter of happiness that elections are being held in 5 states and congratulations to the ECI for holding the elections on time. Shiv Sena will contest elections in 2 out of 5 states. We will form an alliance with the NCP. We are planning to set up a Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) in Goa. However, the decision will be taken only after the local Congress leaders reach a consensus on the issue,” he said. Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant had said the Sena didn’t even have a sarpanch in Goa, to which Raut responded, saying: “A few years ago, the BJP did not even have a sarpanch in Goa. Our MLAs will come first, then sarpanch. Has the BJP joined hands with some opposition parties to divide the votes in Goa? Such doubts are beginning to arise. Opposition parties need to work very consciously. They should fight the election together. The people of Goa want to remove the BJP. But I am afraid that the BJP will benefit from the lack of unity in the opposition,” Raut said.Raut said Congress leader Rahul Gandhi wanted an MVA in Goa. “Rahul Gandhi also wants an MVA in Goa. But local Congress leaders are still confident of a majority government. I wish them well. We are still talking about the MVA in Goa,” Raut said. “We are preparing to fight in Goa and Uttar Pradesh. There are other big parties in Goa, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab. They are definitely preparing well. Their advertisements, banners, hoardings will be visible but the Shiv Sena’s ideology is reaching the people,” said Raut.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/sena-pitches-for-an-mva-in-goa-to-fight-polls-in-up-too/articleshow/88783301.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: BMC nod for 4,000 PAP homes via cashless plan||MUMBAI: BMC’s general body last week cleared a proposal to construct 4,000 units for project-affected persons (PAPs) in Chandivli using a controversial ‘cashless’ scheme. Each unit will cost the BMC around Rs 59 lakh. BMC had in 2021 floated a plan to give credit notes instead of money to contractors to build 12,000 housing units for PAPs for nearly Rs 9,000 crore. But after the scheme turns controversial, now, it will build only 4,000 units in Chandivli via the ‘cashless means’ for nearly Rs 2,500 crore. The proposal to build 4,000 PAP units by way of credit notes and transfer of development rights (TDR) was placed before the general body for approval. BJP opposed the plan, it was cleared by the ruling Shiv Sena. A developer can use the credit notes to pay municipal taxes and premiums to BMC, or even sell credit notes to other developers. “We had received applications to build PAP units...We did a detailed rate analysis by verifying actual agreement value of deals in zones from the inspector general of registration and stamps and found that the rates were feasible for only one zone in Chandivli and 108 units in Dahisar. So we are only going ahead with that. Lower rates were quotes for Mankhurd but we have not processed that proposal,” said a civic official. Officials said the value of the credit notes is Rs 1,584 crore, of land TDR Rs 295 crore and of construction TDR Rs 619 crore. Each PAP unit measuring around 27.9 sqmt will cost BMC just below Rs 60 lakh. Compared to the market rate, BMC’s total savings will be around Rs 178 crore. Officials said based on ongoing infrastructure projects, BMC needs 36,000 PAP units. Of the total cost, BMC will issue credit notes worth Rs 39 lakh per unit and the rest will be TDR. BJP alleged that BMC had favoured a builder who quoted Rs 39 lakh in credit notes while another who quoted Rs 35 lakh was overlooked. “BMC must put the project on hold and not issue a letter of intent to the builder. This is nothing but backdoor entry to BMC’s coffers to empty it. By choosing a higher price, BMC will lose Rs 1,584 crore,” said BJP Corporator Prabhakar Shinde.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/bmc-nod-for-4000-pap-homes-via-cashless-plan/articleshow/88783302.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Naqvi was in Mumbai for two days till Saturday in connection with a meeting of Haj trainers at Haj House in south Mumbai. “We got information that the minister wanted to visit Haji Ali Dargah. Its doors are open to all. We facilitated his visit. He spent around 45 minutes on the premises,” said the dargah’s trustee Sohail Khandwani, who is also Mahim Dargah’s managing trustee. Asked if the Haji Ali Dargah management had drawn flak from a section of people for allowing the minister’s visit, which is being seen as “political” since the PM and BJP claimed his security had been “compromised” during his visit to Punjab, Khandwani said, “We don't ask visitors what they are going to pray for at Sufi shrines. Everyone is free to come and pray for divine blessings through Sufi saints.” Speaking to reporters after his visit to the shrine, Naqvi said he prayed for the PM’s “well-being and long life”. “Similar prayers were made at the shrines of Hazrat Nizamuddin Aulia in Delhi and Khwaja Gharib Nawaz in Ajmer too. The life of the PM is precious and we must pray for his healthy, long life,” said Naqvi. Many BJP leaders, including chief ministers, organised havans and prayers for the PM since the much-publicised “security lapse” during Modi's recent visit to Punjab.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/union-minister-naqvi-prays-for-pm-at-haji-ali-sets-tongues-wagging/articleshow/88783303.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: CSMVS restoration done before centenary on Monday||MUMBAI: The Covid-related lockdown, exodus of labour, stoppage of transportation and the threat of infection all worked to thwart a momentous occasion in the city’s history that unfolds on Monday. Despite the hurdles, the most extensive restoration of the city’s iconic Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya (CSMVS) has been achieved in time for its centenary. CSMVS (formerly Prince of Wales Museum) in Colaba turns 100 years old on January 10. This was the day it was thrown open to the public in its present form, before that the structure served as a hospital for soldiers who were wounded in World War I. In time for the occasion, the management had undertaken the most extensive restoration of the museum in its entire history. On Monday, visitors will enter a beautifully refurbished main hall and look up to see the interior of the grand dome in its resplendent glory. The labourers had erected a 110-foot-tall scaffolding to reach the top. CSMVS’s director general Sabyasachi Mukherjee said, “We wanted a grand ceremony but will settle for a small function that will be live-streamed on our YouTube channel. A documentary film will be broadcast as well.” Conservation architect Vikas Dilawari, who undertook the restoration, describes it as a “once -in-a-lifetime opportunity to serve his city”. “Our plans were thwarted by the lockdown of March 2020 and we had to abandon the work. By May, we all, especially the museum staff, had sleepless nights as the terrace waterproofing was opened up in certain areas. The museum managed to cover the roof with temporary Galvalume sheet roofing just in time (for the monsoon),” said Dilawari. The later Covid-related restrictions interrupted Phase 2. “But since there were no visitors and employees during the 16-month shutdown, we utilised the opportunity to do internal work, like porches, staircases, key gallery, dome, sculpture gallery and verandahs,” said Mukherjee. Dilawari said nearly 50% has been achieved in two years and the remainder will be completed in the next two. Phase 3 involves restoring the external dome that is encased in scaffolding at present. Dilawari upgraded existing drawings, prepared a detailed fabric status report before carrying out repair and refurbishment of the exteriors and interiors of both the main building and the annexe. The project involves four phases, including the dome, and the rest of the campus. Both Mukherjee and Dilawari say the lighting consultant Suresh Koke did wonders with the illumination which was a challenge at that height. The museum’s committed patron TCS Foundation is funding the entire project that costs Rs 21 crore.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/csmvs-restoration-done-before-centenary-on-mon/articleshow/88783305.cms||Bella Jaisinghani

---||Mumbai||‘Tenants sans flats for 42 yrs, can’t nix allotment on whim’||Mumbai: “Cancellations of allotments are not a matter of whim or caprice of the housing board,” said the Bombay high court this past week, setting aside a 2019 cancellation of an allotment of a permanent alternate accommodation to a tenant. The allotment was made four decades after a dilapidated building he resided in was demolished. The building at Temkar Street in south Mumbai was demolished in 1978.The original tenant, Mohammed Usman Shaikh, and his family were moved to a transit camp in 1978. At some point, the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (Mhada) demanded possession of even the transit camp premises and Shaikh and family had to live elsewhere at their own expense. “Altogether about 32 years have by now passed since the petitioner had surrendered even the transit accommodation,” said a bench of Justices G S Patel and Madhav Jamdar. “In short, the petitioner has been without permanent housing for 42 years.”Shaikh’s lawyer Anita Castellino said in November 2019 he was allotted a permanent alternate tenement of 271 square feet at Chinchpokli (East) for Rs 66,000, which he deposited, only to receive a letter that December to say his allotment had been cancelled.After hearing advocate Kamlesh Ghumre for Mhada and seeing the letter, the HC said it does not indicate at all the slightest reason for any such cancellation. Another letter followed in October 2020 seeking the original documents and confirming that earlier Shaikh was held eligible for permanent accommodation, said the HC.Shaikh had thus moved the HC to challenge the Mhada action against him as “arbitrary, unreasonable and irrational’’. “That the petitioner was granted an allotment letter after verification displaces any argument that (he) was not an original tenant or was not eligible,” said the HC, adding after granting permanent accommodation, “if this has to be cancelled, it must be for good, discernible, justifiable and stated reasons”.The HC similarly held three other cancellations unjustified in three other petitions filed by tenants and directed Mhada to give possession to them by January 24.The HC said it was not in dispute that on November 26, 2019, following a full verification of all documents, each tenant was allotted a permanent alternate accommodation of varying areas at Chinchpokli against varying amounts of payment. The Mhada had prepared a master list to decide the inter se seniority between those who are to be accommodated in the reconstructed premises. Eligibility was decided against various documents. The disputes were not about the area that is to be provided. The HC in each case said, “The cancellation by the respondents of the allotment on 10th December 2019 cannot be sustained. It is quashed and set aside. The allotment letter of 26th November 2019 is reinstated and confirmed.’’||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/tenants-sans-flats-for-42-yrs-cant-nix-allotment-on-whim/articleshow/88783308.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Mumbai||Fuel prices up: Piped gas for cooking now Rs 39.5, CNG Rs 66||MUMBAI: The price of compressed natural gas (CNG) has seen an unprecedented hike of over Rs 18 in less than a year in Mumbai, with a fresh hike of Rs 2.50 per kg from Sunday morning. The rate of piped gas has also gone up by Rs 1.50 a unit. The hikes have raised fears of a possible auto-taxi fare hike in the region this year, and an increase in school bus fees besides hiked fares for transportation in private buses running on CNG. The CNG hike will be a huge burden for over 8 lakh consumers, including over 3 lakhcar users who opted for the green fuel as it was cheaper than petrol and diesel besides being environment-friendly. This is the fifth hike since October and it has gone up by Rs 14 since October. The revised prices of CNG — inclusive of all taxes — in Mumbai metropolitan region from Sunday morning will be Rs 66 per kg while rate of piped gas will rise to Rs 39.50 per unit. Mumbai Taximen’s Union and Mumbai Rickshawmen’s Union have already petitioned the state transport department for hikes of Rs 5 and Rs 2 for taxi and autos respectively. “The fuel cost taken into account while calculating the fare hike announced in 2021 was less than Rs 50 per kg of CNG. Now this has gone up to Rs 66 which is too high,” said Thampy Kurien of the rickshaw union. However, one of the unions demanded that the price be rolled back so that there is no fare hike burden on consumers. Mumbai Autorickshawmen’s Union leader Shashank Rao said that the government should avoid a fare hike and roll back CNG hikes. “Citizens will not tolerate another fare hike and it will not be proper to demand for one. So we are writing to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and transport minister Anil Parab to intervene,” he said. Drivers of cabs like Ola or Uber are also seeking a hike in fares as many have switched to CNG from diesel. A spokesperson from Mahanagar Gas Limited (MGL) said: “In order to meet the shortfall in domestic gas allocation, MGL is sourcing additional natural gas to cater to the rising demand by consumers. On account of substantial increase in the market price of natural gas, we have to increase prices of CNG and piped gas.” She further said that even after the price revision, CNG offers attractive savings of about 59% and 30% as compared to petrol and diesel respectively at current prices in Mumbai. The comparative price of petrol is Rs 109.98 a litre and diesel is retailing at Rs 94.14 per litre. “Also, domestic piped gas offers 22% saving compared to current price of domestic LPG cylinder that costs nearly Rs 900 a cylinder in Mumbai. Piped gas is safe, reliable and environment friendly,” she added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/fuel-prices-up-piped-gas-for-cooking-now-39-5-cng-66/articleshow/88783309.cms||Somit Sen

---||Mumbai||Bulli Bai and Sulli Deals makers were in touch: Police||MUMBAI: Niraj Bishnoi, the alleged mastermind and creator of the Bulli Bai app, told the police during questioning that he used to hack into and deface the websites of schools and universities in India and Pakistan. Bishnoi also disclosed that he was in touch with the person behind the Twitter handle @sullideals, the alleged creator of the Sulli Deals app that was hosted on GitHub last July, the police said. It also emerged on Saturday that the three youths arrested from Bengaluru and Uttarakhand in the Bulli Bai app case have never met one another. The accused — Vishal Kumar Jha (21), Shweta Singh (18), and Mayank Rawat (21) — during questioning told Mumbai Police they knew the app’s creator, who is in Delhi Police’s custody, through social media and believed that he was in Nepal. Mumbai Police on January 2 reportedly sought details from hosting platform GitHub (headquartered in San Francisco) of all activities carried out on the Bulli Bai app. Bishnoi, a second-year BTech student who was suspended from his institute after his arrest, claimed he hated certain classes of people and had been using Shweta’s Twitter handle to post content and propagate the Bulli Bai app, said DCP KPS Malhotra of Delhi Police’s Intelligence Fusion and Strategic Operations (IFSO) unit. After Delhi Police’s custody of Bishnoi (21) ends and once a production warrant is issued in court, Mumbai cyber police can obtain his custody. Mumbai cyber police are further probing Bishnoi’s links with the Sulli Deals case. The mobile phones and laptops of those arrested have been sent for forensic tests. “Bishnoi has revealed that he is a habitual hacker, used to defacing websites. He learnt it all when he was 15 years old. Previously he had hacked/defaced various websites of schools and universities in India as well as in Pakistan. His claims of hacking are being verified,” said an officer. Bishnoi told investigators he was inclined towards a Japanese animation character called GIYU. “He created various Twitter handles using the word GIYU. He made an account with this word, through which he challenged law enforcement agencies to nab him.,” said an officer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/bulli-bai-and-sulli-deals-makers-were-in-touch-police/articleshow/88783311.cms||Narayan Namboodiri

The month of January recorded light rain activity of 4 mm. In the last ten years even on years when the month of January recorded rain it has been below one mm. For example last year on January 8, the city recorded 0.2 mm of rains. In the year 2014 the month of January had recorded very meagre rain activity. During all the remaining 8 years there had been no rains recorded in the month of January. Several parts of Mumbai and adjoining areas like Thane and Navi Mumbai witnessed overcast skies along with unseasonal on and off light rain on Saturday through the day. The rainfall recorded in the nine hours ending 5.30 pm on Saturday by the IMD Colaba observatory was very meager (trace) while the IMD Santa Cruz observatory recorded 4 mm of rain. The highest rainfall recorded in January in Mumbai was in 1994 at 17.8 mm on January 12. The light rain significantly brought down maximum temperatures in the city as the IMD Colaba observatory recorded maximum temperatures of 29 degrees while the IMD Santa Cruz observatory recorded maximum temperatures of 27.6 degrees. A day ago on Friday maximum temperatures recorded by the IMD Colaba and Santa Cruz observatory was 29 degrees &30.1 degrees respectively.

---||Mumbai||3 who ‘paid’ ₹49k bills at hotel via fake app arrested||Mumbai: The Saki Naka police on Friday arrested three youths for allegedly cheating a hotel of Rs 49,400 by paying their food bills using a “spoof” e-wallet app between December 3, 2021, and January 6, 2022. The money did not get credited into the hotel’s bank account. The fraud was noticed last Thursday when one of the accused, Ayush Jagdale (20), revisited Hotel Blue Sea and paid Rs 2,700 for the food ordered via the app. The hotel manager, Rajnish Mishra (28), noticed the establishment had not received any transaction credit alert for the money transfer. Following this incident, the hotel manager looked for earlier transactions carried out using e-wallets to make food bill payments by Jagdale and his two now arrested friends Mohammed Khalil (23) and Ibrahim Kazi (27), during their earlier visits and found that no money had been credited. Explaining the modus operandi, DCP (Zone X) Maheshwar Reddy said, “The trio had been using an e-wallet spoof app in the fraud. The app resembles the original e-wallet.”On learning about the fraud, Mishra lodged a complaint with the Saki Naka police. Based on the complaint, DCP Reddy supervised Saki Naka police senior inspector Balwant Deshmukh, inspector Dilip Thorat and sub-inspector Tanaji Pandare, and the detection staff questioned Jagdale and nabbed his associates within two hours of registration of the first information report.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/3-who-paid-49k-bills-at-hotel-via-fake-app-arrested/articleshow/88783315.cms||Narayan Namboodiri
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Restaurants, theatres and malls have to shut by 10 pm||MUMBAI: The state government has allowed malls, markets and restaurants to operate at 50% capacity. Cinemas and drama theatres have also been allowed 50% capacity. The only riders are that those entering have to be fully vaccinated and that all these establishments have to close between 10 pm and 8 am. Private offices have been advised to keep attendance at 50% and offer flexible and staggered timings to keep crowding down. Government offices will not be allowed visitors without the permission of the head of the office. “We don’t want to shut down livelihoods but to curtail crowds. We do not want to impose a lockdown and close down everything,” said chief minister Uddhav Thackeray in a statement. “But no restrictions will be effective unless we all adhere to Covid protocols,” he added. The new notification gets tougher on vaccinations. Although construction and industrial activities as well as cargo transport activities are allowed, these are only for the fully vaccinated. Only fully vaccinated people can attend private offices. Also, besides those working in malls and restaurants, now people engaged in e-commerce and home delivery have to be fully vaccinated as well. Additional restrictions can be enforced separately for districts with low vaccination coverage. Those in the gym and beauty parlour trade are upset. Anita Mohan Salunke, who runs Plush Hema’s Salon in Khar, said, “It is middle-class ladies like me who make up the largest number of beauticians in the city. The big chains are but a few. I trained and worked at a big salon, took a shop on a rent of Rs 1.65 lakh and started my business. How will I survive if we face another closure?” Haami Basan of Planet Muscle gymnasium in Andheri West, said, “Another closure will drive the final nail into the coffin for many gyms. Business is at an all-time low with prolonged shutdowns, monthly rent amounts of Rs 4-5 lakh, salaries and overhead costs.” Restaurants had been allowed to revert to pre-pandemic timings in November 2021, and the trade is hopeful the timings will be extended once again. “In Mumbai we had been allowed to stay open till 1.30 am. Now it’s back to 10 pm. We support the government in the fight against Covid but we hope timings are extended once again,” said Shivanand Shetty, president of the Indian Hotels and Restaurant Association.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/restaurants-theatres-and-malls-have-to-shut-by-10-pm/articleshow/88783316.cms||Bella Jaisinghani
---||Mumbai||If you’ve tested positive, wait three months for booster: Experts||MUMBAI: Healthcare and frontline workers and senior citizens who have recently tested positive for Covid-19 are advised to wait for at least three months before they consider taking the booster shot, experts have said.  The booster shots, which the government has called precautionary shots, are going to be rolled out from Monday. Those who have completed nine months from the day their second shot was administered will qualify for the third dose. Hundreds of frontliners and healthcare workers, though, have tested positive in the Omicron surge.  According to Dr Om Srivastava, an infectious diseases expert and member of the task force, once a person has recovered from Covid-19, the ideal time for a booster shot would be after six weeks to three months. “There is not enough known about how long the natural immunity lasts, so it’s always advisable to get boosted even if one has had the infection and has taken two shots before,’ he said.  The Centre had said in its policy last year that people who have tested positive must wait for 90 days before they go on to take the next vaccine shot. Dr Naveen Thacker, an expert on vaccination, said that the same rule should apply to boosters too. “People should wait for three months at least before getting boosted after a recent infection. If someone is very keen on getting vaccinated, they can do so after two weeks of recovering from the infection. But, since the body already has natural immunity, taking a booster so early wouldn’t benefit much,” he said.  The Centre recently announced that the precautionary dose will have to be homologous, or the same as the first two Covid-19 vaccine shots. So, anyone who has taken Covaxin will get the same vaccine, while those who have taken Covishield will be administered the same vaccine. Mixing and matching of vaccines has been ruled out for now.  Civic officials said they will be offering boosters from Monday, but not many are likely to qualify immediately. Maharashtra has been given an estimation of 29 lakh people above 60 years with comorbidities who would qualify for a booster. In Mumbai, nearly 3 lakh are likely to fall under the category. Officials said that senior citizens don’t have to carry any certificates to prove their comorbidities. Those who have completed nine months or 39 weeks from the date of administration of the second dose will receive messages from Cowin to get vaccinated.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/if-youve-tested-ve-wait-3-mths-for-booster-experts/articleshow/88783317.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ICU bed occupancy is at 30%, oxygen beds at 27%||MUMBAI: Despite the slight drop in cases, Saturday was still the third day of the city clocking over 20,000 cases. The negative growth in Mumbai’s daily detection rate has also put brakes on the state’s daily Covid graph that grew by 36.6% on Thursday and 12% on Friday. BMC chief I S Chahal told TOI that Mumbai’s cases might be stabilising since it was the third day of reporting 20,000 cases. “But we have to wait and watch the trend,” he said. Comparing the occupancy of critical beds between the two waves, Ashwini Bhide, additional municipal commissioner, cited that when Mumbai had 91,108 active cases during the peak of the Delta wave, 85% of the 9,946 oxygen beds and 96% ICU beds were taken. In the current wave, 27% of oxygen beds and 30% of ICU beds are occupied. She said there was no cause for panic, but caution was needed. Deaths in the state and the city came down. Maharashtra reported 13 fatalities, taking the total toll to 1,41,627, while Mumbai reported five deaths, pushing the total deaths to 16,399. Active cases in Mumbai touched one lakh (1,06,037), a mark it had never crossed in the previous two waves. The count of daily hospitalisations, however, declined by 10% compared to the previous day. Civic data showed that 1,257 out of the 20,318 new cases required hospital admission, compared to 1,395 admissions the previous day. 108 patients had to be put on oxygen support. Currently, 7,234 beds out of 33,803 (21.4%) are occupied. Mumbai’s positivity rate, however, hovered around 28%. A state official said it was a sign that the city needed to carry out more tests. “The positivity rate should be down to 10%,” the official said. For the third day in a row, there were a huge number of recoveries in the state (9,671) and city (6,003). The state’s cumulative Covid-19 tally has reached 68,75,656, including 8,93,048 cases in Mumbai. Epidemiologists had previously told TOI that a drop in testing of asymptomatics as per the national policy could bring down the number of tests as well as cases. BMC data showed that the share of asymptomatic patients was 82% on Saturday, down from 85% on Friday and 85% on Thursday. Dr Om Srivastava, a member of the Covid task force, said that whether restrictions have played a role in slowing down cases will also be known in some time. “We may also see a sudden spike again, so we must be alert,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/icu-bed-occupancy-is-at-30-oxygen-beds-at-27/articleshow/88783318.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Mumbai||High sales of self-testing kits spark Covid count concern||MUMBAI: Over 5 lakh self-testing kits have been sold by one company alone in the city in the past one week, underlining the increase in demand for the rapid at-home tests in the Omicron surge. But a fraction of at-home test findings has been reported to health authorities, raising fears of undercounting of cases in Mumbai. Self-testing appears to have become the mainstay of Covid-19 diagnosis in the city overnight with thousands choosing such tests over the more reliable RT-PCR ones. Several doctors are recommending it too as RT-PCR appointments as well as results are taking between 48-72 hours, and given the limited disease-span of Omicron, the wait for an RT-PCR report is almost futile. A positive at-home test also helps one isolate sooner, experts say. Mylab Discovery Solutions that manufactures 'CoviSelf' told TOI they have sold five lakh kits between January 1 and 7 in Mumbai. The company that sells the kit for Rs 250 had wholesaled 25,000 units in the last week of December when cases had just begun to surge. In Delhi, they claim, around 2.5 lakh kits have been sold in January. Hasmukh Rawal, founder of the Pune-based company, said they have seen a 500% jump in sales in a week. Two other self-test kits players- Abbott that manufactures Panbio and Meril that makes CoviFind-have also witnessed big jumps in sales, although they didn't divulge sales figures. Sanjeev Bhatt, senior vice-president, Meril, said they have observed a 50% week-on-week increase in demand. The company claims to have a capacity to make 20 million kits per month. A spokesperson for Abbott agreed Mumbai and the rest of the country has seen a significant increase as the tests are easy to use and give results in 15 minutes. While kit-makers are happy with the sales, health authorities are worried about thousands of cases going under the radar. A civic official said they only receive an average of 2,700-3,000 notifications of self-testing in a day, of which 250-300 are positive results. "People should have a sense of responsibility to log results in the application. We have no other way to find out," said the official. Since BMC started maintaining data about self-testing in August, 89,326 results have been communicated by users. When TOI asked, all manufacturers said they have created mobile apps where people are expected to record results. Local chemists say they have been procuring boxes of a thousand kits which are getting sold out in a day. "We sold 300 kits on Friday and had to call for additional stocks. The demand is maximum in south and central Mumbai," said a sales executive in Prabhadevi. AMC Suresh Kakani said the city has been clocking more than 70,000 tests daily, the majority being RT-PCR. "We are not overly worried about home tests. We assume people will be responsible enough to declare results and isolate themselves when positive," he said. "Also for admissions, one would need an RT-PCR test," he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/high-sales-of-self-testing-kits-spark-count-concern/articleshow/88783319.cms||Sumitra Debroy

In other words, CVC is yet to get the ‘Letter of Intent’ from the BCCI.While the BCCI has been tight-lipped and secretive on the status, TOI has learnt from a source in the know of things that the Board is awaiting clearance from a “few important agencies” before signing the agreement with CVC, who bought the Ahmedabad team in the IPL auction for the two new teams on October 25. “Since the team involves foreign investors as owners, the Board is awaiting clearance from a few important agencies before signing the LOI,” a source told this paper. It’s also believed that the lawyers of the BCCI and CVC have been busy thrashing out the fine details of the agreement. With the issue proceeding at a snail’s pace, it looks difficult if the new IPL teams will be able to announce players acquired by them within the IPL timeline. It remains to be seen if this delay results in the postponement of the IPL auction on Feb 12-13 in Bangalore as well.On its part, CVC is looking to hire former India pacer Ashish Nehra as its team’s head coach, with ex-India coach Gary Kirsten as its mentor. Ex-England batsman Vikram Solanki is likely to become the batting coach of the side.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/cvc-signing-pending-clearance-fromimportant-agencies/articleshow/88783322.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||20 engineering students infected in Bengaluru; many dread offline classes||BENGALURU: A day after the government allowed engineering colleges to remain open, 20 students of a city engineering college tested positive for Covid-19, triggering panic. Twenty hostel students of JSS Academy of Technical Education (JSSATE), which is affiliated to Visvesvaraya Technological University (VTU), tested positive on Saturday and were quarantined in their hostel block. The infections have raised concerns as students are expected to attend offline classes starting Monday. The issue came to light when Anvith Kateel of National Students Union of India and in-charge of VTU tweeted a video of students quarantined in a hall of the hostel block with the caption: “Is this a way of handling students in the hostel? Students tested positive and still the college wants to hide the cases. Where are the so-called ministers of the state who want the students to suffer this way by holding offline classes.” Kateel claimed the college did not acknowledge the Covid cases and even sent out a message to parents calling it fake news. “In the message, the staff and principal claimed they were old Covid cases and at present, no student was positive. Cases in hostels are increasing, but the government is adamant on conducting offline classes,” he said, adding that students from the hostel got in touch with him with videos and proof of Covid infection. Isolated students also shared with STOI photos of BBMP’s notice on their block, which declared on Saturday that 20 people were quarantined in the building. One of the students quarantined in the hostel said: “Two to three days ago, 200 students underwent the test and 21 tested positive on Saturday. Another student said: “We have been told to quarantine for 11 days and on January 20, our internals will begin. This is taking a huge toll on us,” he said. Kateel also claimed that some students in the girls’ hostel were in touch with primary contacts in the boys’ hostel, but were still not tested. “The warden reportedly asked those girls who were feeling uncomfortable to vacate the hostel,” Kateel said. A student who didn’t test positive said they are now scared to attend offline classes. Parents have also raised concerns about physical classes in light of the spike in Covid-19 cases in the city. A parent who is also a doctor asked what was the basis of the revised guidelines of the government? “Why can’t they avoid creating major clusters in colleges now,” the parent said. ‘Separate wing readied’Mrityunjaya V Latte, principal of JSSATE, said the college has identified the students who tested positive and a separate wing was readied for them. “I have identified all facilities for the isolated students. Most of the students I know about have no symptoms and I am in constant in touch with the warden,” he said. He added that the institution is following the modified government order and VTU’s circular on conducting offline classes. “We will have to evaluate the situation and see what can be done. Saturday and Sunday are curfew days, anyway,” he said adding that the university will take a call. VTU vice-chancellor was not available for comments.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/20-engg-students-infectedmany-dread-offline-classes/articleshow/88783326.cms||Farheen Hussain

The data, however, keeps varying, she added. Though the government has mentioned that senior citizens with comorbidities will be given the precautionary dose, there is no need to submit documents proving comorbidity.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/precautionary-dose-for-healthfrontline-staff-from-tomorrow/articleshow/88786043.cms||Sunitha Rao R

While people mostly stayed indoors and traffic remained thin compared to normal weekends, cops and BBMP marshals dotted the streets. The first half of the day saw some traffic on the otherwise deserted stretches, which too gradually declined towards evening. Cops and marshals were seen manning checkpoints, nearly 300 of them, and flagging down almost all passing vehicles. However, ambulances, BMTC buses, private cars ferrying women and senior citizens were not stopped. “Everyone claimed to be in hurry and said they had come out for medical purpose or to buy essentials. While some were genuine cases, some were lying. We have seized vehicles of people who didn’t have a valid reason to step out,” said police. At many places, commuters were seen arguing with cops and marshals.A motorist heading to his workplace made the excuse of having to buy vegetables and got into an argument with police near satellite bus station, Mysuru Road. Vijayamma, a vegetable vendor in KR Market, said the curfew hit her hard as there was no transport facility. “They (government) have given us permission to sell vegetables and fruits, but little did they think about our commute,” Vijaymma told STOI. Ramappa Kumar, an auto driver in Gandhi Bazaar, said: “Educated people flout rules, but we suffer. With two lockdowns, my family is badly affected. My children have stopped going to school...,” said Kumar. “Weekends are when we get most customers,” he added. While grocery stores saw little to no footfall, Iqbal Khan, a store manager in Rajarajeshwari Nagar, said people are wary of stepping out due to the presence of cops. “On Friday evening, there was a mad rush at my store and people waited in queues to pick up groceries. But today (Saturday) I have had only three customers between 9am-5pm,” added Khan. Belagavi cops imposed curbs two hrs soonerIn a goof up, Belagavi police shut shops two hours prior to start of weekend curfew on Friday, causing inconvenience. However, around 9.30pm, police commissioner MB Boralingaiah clarified the curfew starts at 10pm. The confusion stemmed from a factual error in the state guidelines.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/day-1-sees-empty-roads-lots-of-cops/articleshow/88783329.cms||---

The fire began at an under-construction building, where thermocol blocks were stored. Two fire brigades were sent to douse the fire and it was under control in less than 30 minutes. Shoab Abbas, a resident of Prestige Falcon City, rushed to the balcony to see the smoke after an apartment member alerted him. “It was around 1pm when the smoke engulfed the area around my apartment. We were preparing to run our water pipes to douse the fire,” he said. “For nearly 30 minutes, the entrance and exit from our apartment were blocked.” A fireman said it was easy to control the damage as there was no one in the building. “Else, it would have been fatal.” Harish Pandey, DCP (south), said Konankunte police rushed to the spot. “A short circuit ignited the fire and led to burning of thermocol,” he said. “The case is under investigation.” tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/fire-in-building-triggers-panic/articleshow/88783330.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Daily Covid test positivity rate in Bengaluru Urban crosses 10%||BENGALURU: At 10.53 per cent, the daily Covid test positivity rate in Bengaluru Urban (including BBMP) is the highest in Karnataka, as per data with the state war room (as of January 7). The state average is nearly 6 per cent. On Saturday, Karnataka reported 8,906 fresh cases, of which Bengaluru accounted for 7,113. “The test positivity rate has crossed 10% in Bengaluru with the city recording 7,113 cases. It continues to be the epicentre of Covid in Karnataka with 79% cases,” said health minister K Sudhakar. Interestingly, the positivity rate for RT-PCR test in Bengaluru was nearly 11% on January 7, which indicates that even those who do not have classic symptoms of the infection, but are contacts of Covid patients, have turned positive. The positivity rate for rapid antigen rest (RAT) in Bengaluru was 9%. After Bengaluru, neighbouring Mandya has recorded a positivity rate of 6.5%. The positivity rate for RAT was the highest in Ramanagara district (nearly 14%); for RT-PCR, it was less than 1%. Dr CN Manjunath, nodal officer for Covid testing in the state, said a significant number of cases are getting detected with RAT. “The infection rate is high now. Once it becomes very high, more people will test positive with RAT and in such cases RT-PCR need not be done. They get triaged immediately for isolation and treatment. If RAT is negative and the person is symptomatic, then RT-PCR needs to be done,” said Dr Manjunath. Dr Devi Shetty, chairperson, high-level expert committee for prevention and management of Covid third wave in Karnataka, said the number of cases is expected to go up. “Karnataka is one of the states best prepared to handle the third wave. As per the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the US, the isolation period has been reduced to five days,” he said. Dr Shetty added healthcare workers were also getting infected, but all have mild infection being fully vaccinated. According to pulmonologist Dr Ravindra Mehta, who is also a member of BBMP Covid expert committee, for every one case testing positive for Covid, there are 5-10 symptomatic persons who are potentially infected but not under the radar. “The prevalence of infection is rising. Without ignoring symptoms, one must seek medical help at the earliest and isolate,” said Dr Mehta.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/daily-test-positivity-rate-inbluru-urban-crosses-10/articleshow/88783331.cms||Sunitha Rao R

In HAM mode, the agency has to invest 60% of the estimated value and 40% from NHAI,” the letter further stated.It further stated that there has been a delay as the agency failed to mobilise its part of investment. Further, due to Covid-19, the camp remained closed and workers left for their hometowns and most of them are yet to come back.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/nhai-to-soon-repair-potholes-on-bluru-kanakapura-highway/articleshow/88783333.cms||---

The state saw 2,427 cases in the first 11 months of last year. In 2020, the state had recorded a marginal decrease in such cases — 2,107 — compared to the previous year. In 2019, there were 2,146 cases. While 49 suspects were convicted in 2019 under the Act, the number fell to 12 in 2020. Till November 2021, only two had been convicted. However, the fall in convictions is not alarming as acquittals or dismissals too have dipped. In 2019, 355 suspects were either acquitted or dismissed, while the number came down to 131 in 2020. Till November in 2021, 26 accused have been either acquitted or cases dismissed. Public prosecutor GV Gayatri Raju said the social media and use of mobile phones have largely contributed to the increase in cases. “Minors of this generation have free access to internet and they can watch anything they want on their mobile phones. Today, mobile phones are not used just for communication. Videos, pictures and messaging attract the young minds. In many cases, parents of the victims will be professionals, finding less time to watch the activities of their children. A decade ago, we would handle around 4-5 Pocso cases in a month. These days, it is 10-12 cases. The cases of elopement, family members subjecting children to sexual assault and friends of minor girls misusing their innocence have largely increased,” she said. “In a recent case, a 12-year-old girl eloped with 19-year-old friend of her and stayed with him in a town in North Karnataka for almost one month. They lived with an aged flower vendor woman and the neighbours, who found that it was an elopement case, collected around Rs 1,000 and sent them back to their homes. Mobile phones in the hands of the two played a vital role in their elopement,” she said. A senior IPS officer pointed to increased awareness about the Pocso Act among the public. “There is better awareness compared to the earlier times, resulting in more number of cases being registered. Police personnel at the station level are bound to answer to their seniors during periodical meetings on the progress of the cases and such actions ensure more awareness among public. More importantly, mothers and grandmothers of the survivors are standing up for their wards and approaching police,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/after-marginal-dip-in-2020-pocso-cases-up-again/articleshow/88786037.cms||Rajiv Kalkod

According to police, the accused, Shivakumar, had sustained losses and fled the city without paying the agreed monthly amount to the cab owners. Search is on for the remaining cabs, which Shivakumar claims to have attached with private firms in and around Bengaluru. Shivakumar had his office, RS Tours and Travels, at MEI Layout, Bagalagunte. It was closed from the second week of November. His employees Srikant and Krishne Gowda too vanished with their mobile phones switched off. The first complaint against Shivakumar and the others was filed by a cabbie, Manjunath, on November 16. “I had attached my cab with RS Tours and Travels in March 2021. Shivakumar would pay me Rs 15,000 every month for it. Like me, there were hundreds of cab owners who did the same,” he said. However, Shivakumar stopped paying them around October and was incommunicado from November. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/67-cabs-seized-from-travel-agency-owner/articleshow/88783336.cms||---

The suspect was smuggling in 995 grams of the drugs in two boxes from Delhi to be distributed to dealers in Karnataka. Sources said the drug bust unfolded after the anti-narcotics agency received a tip-off that large quantities of recreational drugs were being smuggled via train to Bengaluru and other parts of the state. The sleuths boarded a train that had arrived from New Delhi. While checking the passengers, they spotted the 29-year-old woman, who was behaving in a suspicious manner. They immediately intercepted her, checked her bags and found two boxes of baby food. They actually contained a white crystal-like substance, which a lab test later ascertained to be methamphetamine, a highly addictive stimulant used as party drug and well-known in drug circles as ‘crystal meth’.The drugs had been equally divided between the two boxes and were tightly packed with black plastic. They were being smuggled from Delhi via Hubballi into Bengaluru. The Ugandan woman is suspected to be part of a bigger syndicate. The NCB team is probing how she arrived in India.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/woman-from-uganda-held-with-drugs-worth-1-5cr/articleshow/88783337.cms||Petlee Peter

Five more persons travelling in another car and an MUV sustained injuries, but their condition is stable, police said. The deceased hailed from Kerala and were residing in different houses and PG accommodations in Bommanahalli. They have been identified as Mohammed Fazil, 25, Abhilash Aravind, 25, K Shipla, 30, and Zeena, 27. The accident occurred around 9.30pm near KS Layout, when a rashly driven goods truck rammed the Wagon R in which the victims were travelling towards Kengeri. On impact, the car rammed another truck ahead of it and all four in the Wagon R were crushed to death. Police had to cut open the mangled parts of the car to extricate the bodies. Shilpa worked as a teacher with a private institute, while the other three worked as engineers in different firms in Bommanahalli and surrounding areas. The bodies were shifted to Kempegowda Institute of Medical Sciences, where autopsy was conducted on Saturday. “The family members of the deceased are yet to arrive as most of them have to come from Kerala. Apart from Zeena, we were able to contact the colleagues and friends of three of them,” an investigating officer said. The truck driver, who fled after the accident, is yet to be traced. Other than the Wagon R, one more car, an MUV, and four container trucks were damaged in the accident. Traffic on NICE Road was disrupted for over one hour. “It looks like the victims were heading outside the city. They had clothes packed. But their friends or colleagues don’t know where they were going,” the officer said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/late-night-serial-accident-claimed-3-techies-1-teacher/articleshow/88783338.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Will new coordination panels help? Civic agencies divided||Bengaluru: A series of deadlines to complete ongoing projects and fill up potholes in Bengaluru — set by chief minister Basavaraj Bommai and revenue minister R Ashoka — have not been met, thanks to lack of coordination between various civic agencies.To overcome this problem, Bommai at a recent meeting with Bengaluru legislators, MPs and officials, decided to form two new panels — one at the state level and another at zonal level — wherein all civic agency stakeholders will decide how the Startup City’s infrastructure can be upgraded without destroying its roads.But according to government officials, it is perhaps the 10th time in as many years that a sitting CM of Karnataka has announced such panels in vain. “We have lost count of the number of coordination committees. Political bosses suggest them, but they rarely help,” said a civic agency official.The official went on to add that no matter how many committees the government forms, every civic agency will take on a project only when its financial position is strong. “For example, BWSSB has to lay an underground drainage line on a road freshly laid by BBMP. It can’t take up the project before BBMP lays the road as funds available for that particular project will be allocated by the finance department at a later date. Result: BWSSB will have to dig up the freshly laid road and ask the Palike to relay it,” explained the senior government official.Officials suggest the finance department considers allocations based on the previous projects taken up by the agency, while the majority of its internal resources are used for immediate maintenance work.In fact, an existing coordination committee of Bengaluru civic bodies, headed by chief secretary P Ravi Kumar, is said to meet regularly but hasn’t provided any resolution to the issue of indiscriminate road cutting. “While the top IAS bosses sit in Vidhana Soudha and say there is a coordination committee, no results can be seen at the ground level,” said Bommanhalli MLA Satish Reddy.While some civic agency heads remain skeptical about the move, others have welcomed it. “We will wait and see how these committees are formulated. As of now, the order is yet to be issued,” said BBMP chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta. Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation MD Anjum Parvez said the move was much needed. BWSSB chairman N Jayaram said: “The local-level committee will help BWSSB, BBMP, Bescom and other engineers get clarity on each agency’s responsibility.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/will-new-coordination-panels-help-civic-agencies-divided/articleshow/88783339.cms||Sandeep Moudgal
---||Bengaluru||Why Karnataka's Mekedatu project may not happen any time soon||BENGALURU: The controversial Mekedatu reservoir project may not be implemented in the state any time soon since it’s stuck in a legal tangle. According to legal experts, the project is unlikely to move forward until the Supreme Court gives its verdict on a batch of petitions filed by the Tamil Nadu government opposing it. The TN government has moved the SC, asking it to restrain Karnataka from going ahead with the project, besides questioning the National Green Tribunal’s verdict on Mekedatu. “Unless these two applications are heard and disposed of, it is unlikely that the project will get clearance from the Centre,” said a senior advocate who has been part of the state’s legal team. Water resources minister Govind Karjol concurred and said the government is making all efforts to get these petitions disposed of to take up the project soon. “We have been vociferously pursuing the matter with the Centre and in the Supreme Court. We have also made efforts to get nod from Cauvery Water Management Authority (CWMA) and Union ministry of forest and environment,” Karjol said. However, some experts and several Congress functionaries argue that TN’s petitions pending before the apex court should not come in the way as it is a drinking water project and the nod from CWMA, an independent body formed to implement the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal’s final verdict, is enough. “There are no legal hurdles as such as the SC has not passed orders restraining Karnataka in any manner from taking up the project based on any of TN’s petitions. The TN government had even questioned the permission given by Central Water Commission to Karnataka to prepare a detailed project report. But the SC did not stop Karnataka from preparing DPR. In fact, the DPR has been sent to CWC. Currently, it is before CWMA. All the state government needs to do is get the DPR approved by CWMA and get environmental clearance,” a legal expert said. Another expert who is part of the Karnataka team fighting inter-state water disputes in the SC echoed a similar view. “The state is well within its right to take up any project as long as it ensures flow of 177 tmc ft water to Tamil Nadu as prescribed by the Cauvery tribunal. CWMA is empowered to take a call on the matter but has been holding it for some time, maybe because of political reasons,” he said. An expert pointed to the delay by the Centre in framing terms of reference for taking up environment impact assessment, a prerequisite to get environmental clearance for the project, citing TN’s objections are not sorted out yet. “The need of the hour is for the Centre and states concerned to sit together and sort out the issues. But unfortunately, that culture has disappeared since 1990. The tendency of leaving it to the courts to settle inter-state water disputes is prevalent. There is no other way but to wait for the court’s verdict,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/why-mekedatu-project-may-not-happen-any-time-soon/articleshow/88783341.cms||Anil Gejji
---||Bengaluru||IISc team builds transistor that aids artificial neural networks||Bengaluru: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) — a system of interconnected electric circuits or algorithms that communicate with one another just like neurons in the brain — are gaining popularity for their ability to perform complex tasks, especially in pattern recognition. However, pointing out that existing devices that mimic neurons and synapses (junctions between two interacting neurons) operate at high voltages and show variable conductivity, making it difficult to construct efficient ANNs, researchers at IISc said they’ve developed a new transistor that can help. “...To address these concerns, we have developed a transistor that was found to mimic several characteristics of a biological synapse,” an IISc statement reads.The team, led by Digbijoy Nath at the Centre for Nano Science and Engineering (CeNSE), fabricated a transistor out of multi-layered indium selenide (In2Se3) — an inorganic compound composed of indium and selenium — and tested its response to sequential voltage pulses, similar to the electric signals in neurons. “Communication across biological synapses has certain unique signatures. Prolonged activation of a neuron could make the neuron receiving the signal from it (‘post-synaptic neuron’) either less or more responsive to it, depending on the nature of the signal,” the researchers said.The post-synaptic neuron also responds differently to consecutive pulses separated by a very short time interval as compared to a single pulse, the researchers said, adding that the output characteristics of their device captured these essential features. “Researchers used the device’s responses to build a computer model which simulated an ANN. When they trained the ANN with a database of handwritten numbers, it was able to recognise 93% of numbers correctly...,” IISc added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/iisc-team-builds-transistor-that-aids-artificial-neural-networks/articleshow/88783342.cms||---

BMRCL managing director Anjum Parwez said Namma Metro plans to put up neighbourhood maps at all stations. “The maps will have details such as history, cultural importance and heritage structures and areas of that particular neighbourhood, which will help passengers, particularly tourists, know more about the locality,” he said. He added that space will also be provided to BMTC at the stations to put up display boards with estimated time of feeder bus arrival. “We are also considering displaying static information with bus timings till the display boards are ready,” said Parwez. The MD also said BMRCL is working with BMTC to improve the frequency of feeder services. “We have already tied up with a taxi service started by ex-servicemen to provide last-mile connectivity. MetroRide, an electric autorickshaw firm and Yulu, an app-based two-wheeler rental firm, are also functioning at Metro stations. We will welcome more such firms,” he said. On inter-modal connectivity Parwez said steps have been taken to improve inter-modal connectivity. “We are providing foot- overbridges from Metro stations to nearby bus and railway stations to ensure seamless connectivity,” he said. AV Surya Sen, BMTC director (information technology), said they will get 500 passenger information system (PIS) boards under the Nirbhaya funds by February. “But these boards are more suitable for bus terminuses and not for Metro stations. We are facing a financial crunch, so we not are in a position to purchase boards suitable for Metro stations. If BMRCL or DULT could provide funds, we are ready to do it,” he said. Many regular passengers welcomed the move. “It’s a good idea to display maps and bus timings at Metro stations. This will help passengers plan their journey and also know more about their neighbourhood,” said Anita S, a commuter. Meanwhile, BMTC’s plan to install PIS boards at bus shelters is awaiting BBMP approval. “We need to draw power from bus shelters to install PIS boards, but BBMP is yet to respond,” said a BMTC official. However, BBMP officials said shelters built under the public-private partnership model require permission from private advertisers for installation of PIS boards.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/bmrcl-to-put-up-area-maps-bus-timings-across-metro-stations/articleshow/88783344.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

While 24 cases were booked in 2020, 248 were booked last year. Dismissing the idea that this implies Bengalureans are getting more trigger-happy, top police officers said most of the cases were booked against anti-social elements on recovery of weapons from them and were non-firearm cases. City police commissioner Kamal Pant said his team is proactively pursuing anti-social elements, goons, rowdy elements and mischief mongers. “Our aim is to curb rowdy elements and their activities. We ensure their cases are properly charge-sheeted and courts convict them. We regularly get feedback on the activities of rowdy elements in the city and, when needed, raid them and their associates. This will continue,” he said. In the second week of July 2021, cops raided the houses of more than 2,000 rowdies and anti-social elements in different parts of the city before seizing weapons from them. It was a pre-dawn operation and the result of three back-to-back daylight murders, including that of former BJP corporator Rekha Kadiresh. As many as 409 men were taken into preventive custody and later, 48 were booked under the Arms Act. However, there were instances of firearms being used wantonly in the city last year. A realtor was arrested in October after he opened fire at a two-wheeler using his licensed gun during a road-rage incident. In December, a former corporator’s son attempted suicide using his brother’s gun during a showdown with his family and ended up injuring a friend who had come to his rescue. He was arrested. As per section 25 of the Arms Act, whoever acquires, possesses, or carries prohibited arms/ammunition shall be punished with imprisonment of not less than five years and up to 10 years. The person is also liable to be fined.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/cases-under-arms-act-up-900/articleshow/88783348.cms||---
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Third Covid wave peaking three times faster than second, say experts||CHENNAI: The third wave is peaking at least three times faster than the second wave, health experts said here on Saturday as fresh cases in Tamil Nadu crossed the 10,000 mark. It took just eight days for new cases to rise from about 1,000 on December 31 to 10,978 on Saturday. A similar jump took nearly a month during the second wave — from 1,087 new cases on March 19, 2021, to 10,723 on April 18, 2021. The peak during the first wave was 6,993 new cases on July 27, 2020, which was 57 days after fresh cases breached the four- digit mark for the first time on May 31, 2020. “At the peak of the second wave in May 2021, we touched nearly 36,000 cases a day. Experts estimate that daily cases are likely to be triple that number at the peak this time,” said health secretary J Radhakrishnan. This means, Chennai alone, which reported 7,564 new cases at its peak on May 12, 2021, will report at least 21,000 new cases a day at the third wave peak, expected at the end of January or early February, experts said. Epidemiologists say the city is likely to touch its peak ahead of the state as its infection transmission rate is much higher than the state’s. “The city is densely populated and the virus has a higher chance of finding a new host. So it spreads faster here compared to rural areas,” said National Institute of Epidemiology deputy director Dr Prabhdeep Kaur. Four days ago, the city reported 1,489 new cases and on Saturday it had 5,098. During the second wave, it took 28 days for daily fresh cases to go from 1,083 on April 1, 2021 to 5,445 on April 29, 2021. “This week when people from the city travel to their home districts for Pongal holidays, they are likely to take the infection back into the rural areas,” said infectious disease expert Dr Subramanian Swaminathan. “We saw it happen in March 2020 when people travelled from the city to their homes in the districts when the state imposed a lockdown,” he said. Earlier, health secretary J Radhakrishnan said if Covid rules are violated and cases rise, the state will have no option but to go for a complete lockdown. Health minister Ma Subramanian said the state has directed all district collectors to enforce pandemic protocols, enhance fever surveillance and testing, and ensure all close contacts are tracked. “While health workers will be working to prevent the spread, we may not see results unless people wear masks, maintain social distance, avoid going out and vaccinate,” he said. The state has capacity to increase testing to 3 lakh a day.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/third-covid-wave-peaking-three-times-faster-than-second-experts/articleshow/88783350.cms||Pushpa Narayan
---||Chennai||Chennai: Covid protocols back at gated communities||CHENNAI: The spike in cases has prompted Residents Welfare Associations (RWA) of gated communities in the city and suburbs to revert to Covid protocols that were in place during the peak of past two waves. Restricting deliveries at gates, intensified monitoring of guests and mandatory mask use are among the measures put in place over the past week to curb the spread of the virus. Those employed in apartments in these communities have been asked to complete two doses of the vaccine. Entry is allowed only after thermal checking. Messaging apps used by RWAs are flooded with posts urging residents to inform if any individual has tested positive so their neighbours are aware of it. Colonel C M Unnithan (retired), former executive member of Dinesh Vihar, a gated community at Thazambur, said there was no bar on visitors completed two doses of vaccine. “Also, delivery of food and other products is not allowed at doorsteps. (It is) restricted to gates of each tower,” he said. While the complex is occupied by more than 400 families, about 30% of the occupants were senior citizens, he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/covid-protocols-back-at-gated-communities/articleshow/88783351.cms||---

In case of ICU beds in the five Covid-19 hospitals in the city, only 6% (58 beds) of the 1,090 available ICU beds in the five Covid-19 hospitals are occupied. Of the 3,747 available oxygen oxygen beds, 18% (699 beds) are occupied. Doctors say this shows majority of the patients have not required oxygen support or ICU admission. Dean of Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital Dr E Theranirajan said, 231 patients were seen with an S-Gene drop, but none of them required ICU admission. “Most of the ICU admissions still seem to be from the Delta variant,” he said. The doctors have found the majority of the patients who needed hospitalisation and ICU admissions, were the unvaccinated. “Of the 17 patients in the RGGGH ICU, 11 are unvaccinated. We have put some in C-PAP ventilators, treating them with Remdesivir. These patients are also aged above 60 and have comorbidities,” said Dr Theranirajan. Similarly, Dean of Omandurar GH Dr R Jayanthi said out of the 10 patients in the hospital’s ICU, eight were unvaccinated. With 92% of the city's population vaccinated for the first dose, and 72%for the second dose, the corporation urges the unvaccinated and those due for second dose, to get their shots early. “In the discussions we had with doctors in the city, it is seen that people vaccinated with both doses and are 50 days beyond second dose date, are having much milder symptoms, as compared to patients, who are either unvaccinated or with single dose,” corporation commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi told TOI. He said people must get both doses so that they preferably get immune to Covid and in case they contact the virus, the symptoms are milder. “More than 8 lakh people are due for a second dose in the city. They must take it as soon as possible,” he said .||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/low-occupancy-at-hosps-as-most-have-mild-symptoms/articleshow/88783353.cms||Omjasvin M D

Mani, named in at least eight murder cases, was detained under Goondas Act four times. He was arrested in July 2020. “On perusal of documents available, it is clear the arrest intimation has not been properly translated in vernacular language. Thus, the detention order is liable to be set aside ,” a division bench of justices P N Prakash and R N Manjula said. The court passed the order while allowing a habeas corpus plea moved by Mani’s father N Parthasarathy.  In July 2021, Mani, who was absconding for over three years, was arrested in Sriperumbudur. Mani grew infamous as ‘CD’ Mani as he initially sold pirated DVDs in Teynampet in the 1990s. Later, he joined forces with gangster Periya Mahesh. According to police, Mani helped many real estate businessmen settle deals through illegal means.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/arrest-intimation-not-translated-properly-says-hc-quashing-anti-socials-detention/articleshow/88783356.cms||---
---||Chennai||River sand mining set to return in Tamil Nadu||CHENNAI: Clearing the decks for river sand use in construction after about a decade, the Tamil Nadu government fixed 1,000 per unit as basic cost of sand, and unveiled a set of guidelines to supply sand in a “fair and transparent manner”. To begin with, the department of water resources permitted 16 lorry quarries and 21 bullock carts’ sand quarries, which had environmental clearance (EC), to operate. Following this, as many as 63 lorry quarries and eight bullock cart sand quarries, which are in various stages for obtaining EC, would be permitted to operate as per the existing protocol, said an order issued by Sandeep Saxena, additional chief secretary of the water resources department. Till a decade ago, river sand was a key construction material, but it grew scarce about five years back. Govt to give priority to online booking by public while allotting river sandPromoted aggressively by the then state government, m-sand replaced river sand a lmost totally in recent years. The present order marking the r eturnof r iver sand into construction sector has come amidst allegations from environmentalists that m-sand caused irreplaceable damage to earth and its exploitation was rampant and unscientific. The order instructed authorities to give priority to online bookings from the general public for sand and said there will be centralised realtime monitoring of sand depots and quarries to prevent pilferage. “The existing facilities like IP/ CCTV cameras with 24X7 live streaming and real-time monitoring of all shunting vehicles with GPS and prefixed geofence will be strengthened in the centralised control room in Chennai to prevent pilferage and monitor quarrying activities,” Saxena said. Only after supplying sand to online bookings by the public – between 8am to 2pm – can lorry owners book sand between 2pm and 5pm depending upon the availability of the remaining sand, the order said. The construction industry was quick to welcome reopening of river sand quarries, but cautioned the government against profiteering by intermediaries. Pointing out that the government is now offering a cubic feet of sand atRs10, Builders Associationof India state secretary S Ramaprabhu said the g overnment m ust ensure that it was available to the common man at a nominal price. “The transport charges should not exceedRs25 toRs30 per cft of sand. Otherwise, the intention of the government would be defeated,” he said. While S Sridharan, chairman of urban development and housing, CREDAI National, said developers a lways preferred river sand to m-sand for plastering purposes, G Sundarrajan of Poovulagin Nanbargal, an environmental voluntary group, said the g overnment should explore a lternative technologies in the construction sector so that natural resources are not exploited. Illegal smuggling of M Sand and river sand to neighbouring states m ust be eradicated, he said. “If smuggling is curtailed, about 40% of our natural resources can be saved,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/river-sand-mining-set-to-return-in-tn/articleshow/88783357.cms||---
---||Chennai||Chennai: Social distancing goes for a toss on eve of lockdown||CHENNAI: The city corporation’s warnings of hefty fines and indefinite closure of businesses for violation of Covid-19 norms fell on deaf ears as thousands thronged the shopping hubs in the city on Saturday, the last weekend before Pongal holidays. With the announcement of complete lockdown on Sunday, huge crowds were seen on Ranganathan Street in T Nagar, Purasawalkam, NSC Bose Road and vegetable, meat and fish markets. Residents raised the concern of the infection spreading to them from shoppers. “We are into the third year of the pandemic. By now, the authorities should have devised strategies to control crowding,” said N Jagadessh, a resident of T Nagar. Representatives of commercial complexes said they are doing their best to regulate crowding. Even in residential neighbourhoods like Madipakkam and Lake View area in Ayyappa Nagar were crowded on Saturday evening, with physical distancing norms going for a toss. Meanwhile, the city police on Friday booked 7,616 cases against people for not wearing masks and collected a fine of 15.23 lakh. Special police teams are on duty round the clock to enforce the restrictions. Several residents pointed out that schools and colleges have been shut considering the safety of students and teaching staff. Similar stringent measures have to be adopted in public places too. The contact tracing is difficult in cases of Covid infection spreading from public places, and the onus of responsibility lies with the establishment managers and the public themselves, said a city corporation official. “Nevertheless, with total lockdown on Sunday and Pongal only a week away, such stringent measures were not taken considering economic reasons,” the official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/social-distancing-goes-for-a-toss-on-eve-of-lockdown/articleshow/88783359.cms||---

The Anakaputhur-based girls, who used to post their short videos on social media platforms frequently, went missing from their houses on Thursday. A police team, led by Kundrathur sub-inspector Bharath, traced the missing girls on Friday by tracking the tower location of their mobile phones. The main suspect, S Appu alias Suren of Tiruvottriyur, befriended the girls and invited them to Tiruvottriyur beach where the girls could shoot videos. While at beach he stole the mobile phone of one girl. He later called them to inform that they had left behind a mobile and that they could come to Central railway station and take it back. When the girls returned, Appu offered them lunch and invited four of his friends – college student Sanjay, 19, of Pattabiram, goods delivery agent E Vinith, 20, of Vriddhachalam E Tholkappiyan, 19, of Vaniyambadi and a juvenile of Ernavur – also. Later, all the seven checked into a guest house, where the youths raped the two girls. Among the arrested, while delivery agent Vinith was involved in an attempt to murder case, Appu was involved in a robbery case. Sankar Nagar police registered a case under Section 366 (rape) IPC and Section 8 of POCSO Act and arrested all the five suspects. While four were produced before Tambaram magistrate Anupriya and were remanded in judicial till January 12, the juvenile, who too is a delivery agent, was sent to the correctional facility for boys and girls at Kellys.

He died of ailments due to age. The professor who was famous for his Queen's English and lessons on phonetics, served as the principal of the college from 1989 to 1994. “He was well known for his English pronunciation, so much so that if you close your eyes and listen to his speech you would think a person from the UK is speaking,” recalled Alexander Jesudasan, a former principal of MCC. During his tenure as principal, he also re-established contact with the founders of the college in Scotland. “He was a strong man and he was the principal when the MCC staff strike happened in 1993. He led the college from the front,” said Keshav Kumar, one of his students. The staff strike went on for more than a year-and-a-half. His students remember him as friendly and kind.  "Though he was a dedicated Christian, he used to teach English with absolute neutrality and pack his lectures with small pieces of information,” said Saranyan B V, another student.

This includes 58 regular special teachers, 2,196 on consolidated pay in elementary education department and 147 special teachers on consolidated pay in secondary education department, an affidavit filed by the school education department explained. The affidavit was filed in response to a public interest petition by K Elango to set up an expert committee to identify students with dyslexia and to organise state-wide counselling for school children addicted to social media. The petitioner also wanted the court to direct the department to revamp the Parent Teachers Association (PTA) based on his representations dated August 8, 2017 and October 9, 2017. When the plea came up for hearing, special government pleader Mythereye Chandru submitted that students with dyslexia had been identified by Samagra Shiksha Inclusive Education team with convergence from health and differently abled welfare department. Pointing out that social media addiction is not mentioned as a cause for dyslexia or its associated conditions, the pleader submitted that in 2021 alone 1.75 lakh teachers of government schools have been given an online orientation programme on dyslexia by Madras Dyslexia Association. “So far, 346 children have been found to be affected with dyslexia in Class I to XII. Such students are given 300 per month as transport and escort allowance and 200 per month as stipend,” he said. Recording the same, the first bench of acting Chief Justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari and Justice P D Audikesavalu said, “In view of the steps taken, no further direction is required other than to ask authorities to comply with the decision taken by them.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/tn-has-2400-teachers-working-for-special-children-govt-informs-hc/articleshow/88783370.cms||---

The 2021 April to December revenue was 43% more than in 2020 (6,881 crore) and 19% more than the pre-Covid year of 2019 (8,267 crore). Registration department sources said the revenue is likely to touch 15,000 crore by end of March, 2022. December 2021 also saw the highest revenue from land registration in the past four years at 1,405 crore. Chennai and suburbs are witnessing a spike in new launches. More than 40% of the revenue from property registrations in 2021 was from the Chennai zone comprising the city and neighbouring districts. Knight Frank India said 7,900 housing units were sold between April and December in the Chennai real estate market. In 2021 as a whole, 12,783 housing units were launched. Flat promoters association (Chennai south) vice-president R S Balaji said supply of housing units at present was more than demand from homebuyers as several projects had been completed after pandemic restrictions were lifted after the second wave. “Currently, customers have multiple choices if they want to buy an apartment in the southern and western suburbs," he added. Suresh Krishn, president of CREDAI (Tamil Nadu chapter), said that there would be a 'short term' impact on housing sales due to the lockdown restrictions in view of the third wave. The impact will depend on the number of days the restrictions are in place. Demand will revive after the curbs are is eased, he said. Srinivas Anikipatti, senior director, Tamil Nadu and Kerala, at Knight Frank India, said the number of bookings will be less during the lockdown days when there is no access to registration offices.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/revenue-through-property-registration-at-a-5-yr-high/articleshow/88783375.cms||Yogesh Kabirdoss

The gift hamper distribution started in TN on Tuesday, after being stuck for a couple of days owing to shortage of bags, resumed on Saturday after the government issued a release saying people can bring their own bags and collect the items. They can collect the free bags at a later date, the release said. More than 2.1 crore rice card holders are there in TN, who are eligible to receive the gift hampers of 20 items including rice, jaggery and sugarcane. The government has cited Covid restriction for the delay in getting the bags stitched. Inquiries revealed that the problem is that the contract for supply of cloth bags was given to a single person. He is not in a position to supply such a huge quantity in a short time. Officials in the food department were initially reluctant to flag the issue, fearing a backlash, said an official. However, the DMK-affiliated Labour Progressive Front flagged the issue a couple of days ago and submitted a petition to chief secretary V Irai Anbu, seeking his intervention. “We are immediately responding to the complaints regarding the quality of gift hampers to more than 2.1 crore cardholders. We have also launched a helpline for the public if there is an issue with quality or quantity of the gift hampers,” food and civil supplies minister R Sakkarapani told reporters.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/cloth-bag-shortage-impedes-pongal-gift-hamper-distribution/articleshow/88783377.cms||Shanmughasundaram J

---||Chennai||Chennai: Two vaccination doses must for travel on suburban trains||CHENNAI: Southern Railway has decided to allow only vaccinated people to travel by suburban trains in the city from January 10 till the end of the month, in view of the spike in Covid-19 cases. Ticket booking on UTS mobile app has been suspended as there is no provision for commuters to upload their vaccination certificate in the app. The suburban trains will be operated with 50% seating capacity, said a press release, adding that people not wearing masks at stations or on trains will be fined 500. The passengers will have to produce the second dose vaccination certificate along with an ID proof to get both single-trip and season tickets. Those who already possess a season ticket will have to show their certificate if railway staff asked for it. Only 343 of the total 600 daily suburban services will run on Sunday due to curfew. Regular commuters are wary that the rule of producing vaccination certificates will result in crowding at the ticket counters. T Sadagopan, a commuter and consumer activist, said, "The UTS ticket booking application should have a provision for commuters to upload vaccine certificates in order to avoid crowding at the counters. Now, as the railway staff have to verify the vaccination certificates for every passenger, this will result in long queues.” The railways has also appealed to passengers to wear masks, maintain social distancing and wash hands regularly at stations and on trains. Sources said the railway staff and Railway Police Force have been instructed to ensure that passengers comply with Covid-19 safety protocols at stations and on trains, as people are not wearing masks after boarding trains.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/two-vax-doses-must-for-travel-on-suburban-trains/articleshow/88783380.cms||---

The results of study, touted as the first to be conducted in India to evaluate the effectiveness of vaccines in reducing reinfections among HCWs in a real world setting, has been published by medical journal JAMA Network Open, which is brought out by the American Medical Association. The researchers, which included AIIMS director Randeep Guleria, said their findings suggest that Covaxin was associated with protection against both, symptomatic (87% effectiveness) and asymptomatic (84%) reinfection in HCWs after a complete vaccination schedule when the predominant circulating variant was B.1.617.2 (Delta). The study looked at 4,978 HCWs that tested positive for Covid-19 between March 3, 2020, and June 18, 2021, out of the 15,244 HCWs that participated. For estimating Covaxin’s effectiveness 1,917 HCWs out of these were divided into three groups that included 472 unvaccinated, 356 partially vaccinated and 1,089 fully vaccinated. Of these, 124 cases of reinfection were identified while eight were excluded as they were either reinfected before vaccine rollout or got a different vaccine (Covishield). Of the remaining 116 cases, there were only 17 cases of reinfection among HCWs fully vaccinated with Covaxin as compared to 60 HCWs that were unvaccinated and 39 partially vaccinated. “A protective association of 86% against reinfection was observed among HCWs who completed the two-dose schedule of BBV152 (Covaxin) and for whom at least 15 days elapsed without reinfection after vaccination,” said the study.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/covaxin-86-effective-in-curbing-reinfection-study/articleshow/88783382.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

Since cocktail therapy isn’t working as well in Omicron cases — and delta variant remains prevalent too — indicative tests are being done at some places before deciding on the treatment plan. At other places, cocktail therapy is being used on mildly symptomatic patients. “We have been giving the therapy to an average of five patients in a day for the last 10 days now,” said a doctor from a corporate hospital, adding that since patients are insisting, and it can be beneficial in mild cases, it is being used. While patients turning up at government hospitals too are demanding this treatment, they are being refused. “Majority of patients already have fixed ideas about what treatment protocol is best for them and are demanding this cocktail therapy,” said a source at the Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences and Research (TIMS).Dr Sambit Sahu, medical director, KIMS, Kondapur said, “While a lot of patients are coming and asking for the cocktail regime, it is not suitable for every patient. Patients coming with an RT-PCR positive test and mild symptoms can be either infected with the new Omicron variant or the existing Delta variant and there is no way of knowing for sure. The therapy is only useful in a patient infected with the Delta variant and have mild symptoms only. Some imported kits which can be used to indicate which variant it is, although not conclusive, are used before giving the therapy.”Dr G Srinivasa Rao, director public health said, “This is not part of treatment protocol and is not useful in the current scenario where over 70% of the cases are estimated to be of the Omicron variant. People should refrain from insisting on getting cocktail regime.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/to-give-cocktail-regime-hospitals-check-for-variants/articleshow/88783383.cms||Amrita Didyala

Hyderabad is known for being the hub for MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions) events. Annually, the city hosts close to 100 big events. However, the Covid-19 pandemic has cast a shadow on all MICE events for the past two years. The Hitex Exhibition Center which hosts many of these big exhibitions and expos was observing recovery from the second wave only recently. Now, many postponements and cancellations are being reported. “For January 2022, already five events have been cancelled or postponed. Uncertainty prevails on the fate of four other scheduled events to be held this month,” said Srikanth TG, business head, Hitex Exhibition Center, adding that the almost 75% of the business for 2022-23 had returned to pre-pandemic times. Banquet halls and hotels too are seeing cancellations and postponements. “Banquet business is a substantial contributor for most hotels in Hyderabad and with the surge in the number of Covid-19 cases, we all are experiencing few cancellations and postponements. But following the current trend, small meetings and events are expected to continue as planned, with precautionary measures,” said Ian Dubier, president of Hotels and Restaurants Association of Telangana. Some people are shrinking their guest list and calling off their plans to have a big-fat wedding. “We had several guests who were set to visit Hyderabad for our wedding from other cities. Now, that our guests are unable to make it for the wedding, we have cancelled the venue and have decided to go ahead with a small family wedding,” said Bhagyashree (name changed), who had booked a resort on the outskirts of Hyderabad.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/meets-weddings-cancelled-under-omicron-shadow/articleshow/88783385.cms||Preeti Biswas

It was able to induce both memory B and T cells and led to a pronounced increase in T-cell responses.Covaxin has become the first vaccine in India to report safety and immunogenicity results from a booster clinical trial. The study, titled `Persistence of immunity and impact of a third (booster) dose of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, BBV152; a phase 2, double-blind, randomised controlled trial’, was uploaded on pre-print server medRxiv. It involved 184 volunteers (most of whom participated in phase-II study) and contains results of impact of booster dose a month after it was given.Researchers said neutralisation titers (concentration of neutralising antibodies) against wild-type and Delta variants of SARS-CoV-2 were five times higher than after a two-dose schedule of Covaxin and similar increases in neutralising antibodies against Alpha, Beta, Delta plus were seen. After third jab, neutralising antibodies against homologous and heterologous SARS-CoV-2 variants increased 19-to 256-fold, indicating a booster dose may be required, Bharat Biotech said.Study found though cell-mediated immunity and neutralising antibodies to homologous (D614G) and heterologous strains (Alpha, Beta, Delta and Delta plus) persisted above baseline six months, magnitude of responses declined, which third dose boosted. Reactogenicity after vaccine and placebo was minimal and comparable, with no serious adverse events.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/covaxin-booster-may-protect-against-severe-covid-19/articleshow/88783386.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

What did he achieve even after becoming four times CM for Madhya Pradesh?,” Telangana health minister T Harish Rao said at a press conference on Saturday. He added that Madhya Pradesh is not match with Telangana in any sector. Though Madhya Pradesh is geographically a bigger state, Telangana GDP is more than MP’s. “While the Telangana GDP is 9.78 lakh, MP’s GDP is 9.77 lakh,” Harish Rao said.

---||Hyderabad||Telangana, Andhra Pradesh to meet over bifurcation issues on January 12||HYDERABAD: After a long gap, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh will sit across the table to discuss bifurcation issues at a crucial meeting to be conducted by the Centre on January 12. Official sources said the Centre was likely to discuss four major unresolved issues between both the states. The Union home secretary will be holding the meeting with chief secretaries of both the states. Power arrears, division of Schedule IX and X institutions, Andhra Bhavan property issue and Singareni Collieries property sharing are among the important subjects that would come up for the discussion. Apart from these, the Telangana government is likely to raise the Krishna water sharing and illegal projects and promises made by the Centre such as setting up a tribal university, steel plant and rail coach factory assured under the AP Reorganisation Act, 2014. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao held a meeting with chief secretary Somesh Kumar, special chief secretary (finance) K Ramakrishna Rao and senior officials a couple of days ago to chalk out a strategy to be adopted at the January 12 meeting. The CM instructed the officials to make it clear that Telangana was committed to the Reorganisation Act and wanted the Centre to keep its promises. Many issues were pending due to the attitude of the AP government, the officials told the CM. Official sources said the AP government was claiming that Telangana power utilities have to pay 6,015 crore to AP towards power supply charges after the bifurcation of the state. But, officials pointed out that Telangana needs to pay only Rs 3,442 crore to APGenco. “Though Telangana is ready to resolve the issue amicably, AP has chosen to take a legal course by approaching the NCLT,” a senior official of the state government said. On the division of AP Bhavan issue, which AP wants the property to be divided on the lines of floor space index, Telangana is working out a proposal on providing alternate land to AP and asking the neighbour to leave the property to Telangana. “Though the expert committee headed by Sheela Bhide gave some recommendations on bifurcation of Schedule IX and X institutions, we are not agreeing with the definition of headquarters of institutions given by the committee. This needs to be relooked,” an official, who was involved in thrashing out the bifurcation issues, said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/telangana-ap-to-meet-over-bifurcation-issues-on-jan-12/articleshow/88783400.cms||Koride Mahesh

Over 4,300 acres of land is required for the northern stretch of the project, extending between Sangareddy, Narsapur, Toopran, Gajwel, Yadadri, Bhongir, Pragnapur and Choutuppal urban clusters. Touted to be the country’s largest ring road, RRR, in all, might require over 9,000 acres of land, including a roughly estimated 5,000 acres to construct its remaining 182-km southern stretch. Over 9,000 acres would be the highest extent of land acquisition for a road development project in the history of the state. A senior official said over 6,000 acres were acquired for the development of the 158-km ORR project. The land required for the northern part of RRR itself is 4,300 acres. However, it is the irrigation projects which take the top position when it comes to land acquisition with Kaleshwaram project alone requiring over 30,000 acres. Over 12,000 acres are required for Mallannasagar, a reservoir in the mega . The southern part of the expressway extends up to 182-km connecting Choutuppal, Ibrahimpatnam, Kandukur, Amangal, Chevella, Shankarpally and Sangareddy. An official survey to identify the extent of land needed for the southern stretch is yet to be taken up as the proposal is pending with the central government. The new expressway, which would connect a majority of districts in Telangana, is planned to be developed in two parts under the central government’s Bharatmala Pariyojana Phase-I programme at a cost of over 17,000 crore. The state has assured to bear 50% of its land acquisition cost and allocated 750 crore towards it in its 2021-2022 budget. An official said a public hearing for land acquisition for northern stretch of RRR may be held by end of this fiscal. A report with details of villages, where land acquisition has to be done, has been sent to National Highways Authority of India (NHAI). Revenue officials will acquire the land and give the project site to NHAI for RRR development.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/land-survey-for-north-leg-of-rrr-completed/articleshow/88783401.cms||Roushan Ali

The arrested are said to have arranged bank accounts for some Nigerian nationals who would park their money in these accounts after duping gullible individuals through fraudulent offers of gifts. The duo was nabbed following a complaint by a resident of Begumpet. The complainant had stated that he had received a message on WhatsApp from a person claiming to be one Dr Harry Robert from the United States. The two of them then stayed in touch for some time through various social media. Robert informed the complainant that he was planning to come to India on vacation and that he would be bringing some gifts for the latter. The complainant was told by Robert that he would be starting from the US on July 11 and land in India the next day. “Later, the complainant received calls from a person posing as an immigration officer, claiming that Robert had been caught at the airport and that he needed to pay money towards anti-terrorist certificate, money laundering charges among other things. The complainant was convinced and transferred over 9 lakh to various accounts belonging to the fraudsters,” Hyderabad police said. Police said that Mohammed Naim and Mohammed Farookh — both residents of Bareilly, had been arrested for their involvement in this racket. Cops seized debit cards and passbooks from the possession of the accused. The duo is said to have been collecting 10 per cent commission from their Nigerian associates for helping them move the money. The two arrested had opened as many 40 bank accounts.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/city-police-arrest-two-from-up-in-gift-scam/articleshow/88783402.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Enforcement Directorate questions Hyderabad MSJ letting off 2 accused in money laundering cases||HYDERABAD: Justice K Lakshman of the Telangana high court has reserved his orders in two separate pleas filed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) questioning the action of the Hyderabad metropolitan sessions judge (MSJ) in refusing to send two accused to remand in two money laundering cases the ED was investigating. The two accused — Kamma Srinivas, director of Madhucon group of TRS MP Nama Nageswara Rao and Omni Medi company MD Kancharla Srihari Babu — belong to two different cases. While Srinivas is facing the case for alleged misappropriation of a national highway construction project at Ranchi, Srihari Babu was charged with swindling public money to the tune of Rs 135 crore in the IMS-ESI scam. When ED arrested the two accused and produced them before the designated ED court, the MSJ refused to recognise the remand report furnished by the ED and returned it. Agreeing with the argument of the advocates of the accused, the judge said in all cases where the IPC sections carry jail terms that are less than seven years, police have to necessarily issue a prior notice to the accused under section 41-A of CrPC. Since that procedure was not followed in this case, the judge said that he will not send the accused in judicial remand. The judge then allowed the accused to go scot-free from the court hall itself. The ED was aggrieved and preferred two separate criminal appeal petitions before the high court and questioned the decision of the trial court. Appearing for ED, additional solicitor general T Surya Karan Reddy said ED acts under a special law, the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), which has its own code fully defined and incorporated in the Act itself. “We need not follow CrPC,” he said. The MSJ took an erroneous view without keeping in view the intent of the legislature which conferred a superior status to the PMLA, he said. The accused were arrested under section 19 of PMLA. Since there was no provision in PMLA dealing with the procedure to be followed when investigation could not be completed within 24 hours, the ED had filed a remand petition under CrPC urging the court to send the accused in judicial remand, he said. This did not mean that ED had to follow the CrPC. The judge reserved his orders in both cases.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/ed-questions-msj-letting-off-2-accused-in-money-laundering-cases/articleshow/88783404.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

The university, which knocked the door of the high court last year challenging the action of the state and GHMC officials in forcibly taking away 18 acres of its land and laying a blacktop road on it, was shocked to see the verdict of the single judge who made its rights over its entire extent of 2,300 acre land questionable. “The land is in our possession from 1975 onwards. Even if the state wants to take a portion of the land, it has to acquire the same by following due process of law,” the university said in its appeal. Expressing the same in its appeal, the varsity filed a writ appeal. It urged the court to stay this order and also to restrain the state and the civic body from using the road laid in its land.A bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Abhinand Kumar Shavili issued notice to the state, Rangareddy district collector, and Serilingampalli tahsildar and sought replies from them to the contentions raised by the UoH. The bench, however, refused to pass any restraint order without hearing the state.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/uoh-challenges-single-judge-order/articleshow/88783406.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Abhishek: In my opinion, no election should be held for the next 2 months||Kolkata: All political and religious meetings in Diamond Harbour Lok Sabha will be stopped till February 28, Trinamool Congress national general secretary and Diamond Harbour MP Abhishek Banerjee said on Saturday. After a meeting with district officials, Banerjee said: “In my personal opinion, everything should be deferred for the next two months. Vote can be held later. If people survive, everything can be done.”On the elections in five states, he said, “There are polls in five states. But the positivity rate is also increasing. We will all survive only if people survive.” Asked if he felt that the January 22 civic polls in Bidhannagar, Asansol, Siliguri and Chandannagar should be deferred, Banerjee said, “The matter is in HC. I cannot speak on it.”Though Banerjee repeatedly stressed that this was his personal opinion, TMC Rajya Sabha MP Sukhendu Sekhar Ray quickly endorsed it as the “party view” as well.“We have seen what had happened during the Bengal elections. Positivity rates had peaked over 40% on some days. From there, everyone fought to bring it down to 1-2%,” Banerjee added.Speaking to reporters, the Diamond Harbour MP said: “There will be no political meetings for the next two months (in Diamond Harbour). While religious programmes can be held in homes, a religious gathering of 200-700 people will also not be permitted. All parties should now rise above their interests to battle Covid. If people remain, so will politics and political fights. No one is fleeing.”Banerjee’s statement came days ahead of several lakh people reaching the Sagar Islands for the Gangasagar Mela. The HC, based on a state plea, has allowed the mela with strict curbs. Much of the route the pilgrims will take will be through Diamond Harbour. “The HC has issued directions. Everyone will comply with it. But along with the administration it is also our duty to help the state to follow all HC-stipulated norms, including the 50-people cap at one place,” he said.Banerjee said doctor-on-wheels will be introduced to augment the control room and telemedicine units set up in every municipal ward and panchayat in the LS constituency. Urging the use of RAT self-test kits, Banerjee said health workers will also reach out for household tests. “If zones show higher numbers, then everyone in the family will be taken to institutional quarantine,” he said.Saying he will meet district officials again on January 20, Banerjee said, “On January 2, the positivity rate in Diamond Harbour was 26% and on January 7, it had reduced to 9.5%, though it is spiking in Bengal and Kolkata in particular. We wish to bring down the rate in Diamond Harbour to around five percent in the next week. Currently in Diamond Harbour police district it is 12.7% in RT-PCR tests and 8.6% in RAT tests. We will also make double masks mandatory for both sellers and buyers in markets.”While medical experts immediately lauded Banerjee’s decision saying such thinking will help the state combat the case surge, BJP remained critical. “He is the second topmost leader in TMC. Then why aren’t they acting on what they say and deferring the civic polls,” asked BJP national vice-president Dilip Ghosh.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/abhishek-in-my-opinion-no-election-should-be-held-for-the-next-2-months/articleshow/88783409.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Omicron driving Kolkata spike, 7 out of 10 Covid cases positive for variant||KOLKATA: The Omicron variant of SARS-COV-2 virus has in less than a fortnight surpassed the Delta strain in Kolkata’s population with seven out of 10 Covid-19 samples collected in the last week of December and sent for genome sequencing turning out to be this ‘variant of concern’, according to the National Institute of Biomedical Genomics (NIBMG) in Kalyani. Fuelled by the highly transmissible Omicron, Kolkata on Saturday clocked 7,337 fresh cases, which was 39% of Bengal’s daily Covid count of 18,802,, even as the state’s positivity rate jump-ed to 29% from 26.3% in 24 hours. On Friday, the city had recorded 7,484 new cases and Bengal 18,213 fresh infections but the the number of tests conducted was around 6,000 more that that of Saturday. “Like in Delhi and Mumbai, Omicron has outplayed Delta in Kolkata. From detecting the first Omicron case without travel history in the fourth week of December, we have now confirmed 200 Omicron variants in the samples that have undergone genome sequencing at NIBMG. This week, seven out of 10 Covid samples are turning out to be Omicron, a sign that large swathes of the population are now infected with Omicron and it is spreading exponentially. Very soon, Omicron will surpass Delta in not just the metros but across the country,” said NIBMG director Saumitra Das, who is also the national coordinator of Indian SARS-COV-2 Genome Consortium (INSACOG). Despite the sharp rise in infections, the fatality rate (CFR) in Bengal between December 25 and January 7 has been 0.2%, which experts believe, points to the fact that Omicron is less virulent. A large proportion of deaths recorded in this fortnight has been in the 75-plus age group. While hospital admissions rose by a mere 1,797 in this period, home isolation numbers shot up by 42,138.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/omicron-driving-city-spike-7-of-10-cases-ve-for-variant/articleshow/88783411.cms||Subhro Niyogi

After the rejection of its application, the organisation had asked its 240-odd homes for orphans, destitutes and AIDS patients not to operate its foreign contribution bank accounts, forcing them to temporarily curtail expenses. On Friday, however, MoC was added to the list of NGOs eligible to receive foreign funding in Bengal. The news was immediately hailed by well-wishers . “The power of love and service has won.

Several teachers’ organisations had written to the education department to postpone the examination to safeguard examinees, invigilators and their families and prevent the virus from spreading. “The West Bengal College Service Commission is going ahead with the examination on Sunday and it will be conducted by the vice chancellors and registrars of universities, principals of colleges, teaching and no-teaching staff of the universities and colleges. All those who are assigned the examination duty are requested to co-operate actively for smooth conduct of the 23rd WBSET,” said an official of the education department. Isolation rooms have been set up for candidates who are either suffering from Covid or show symptoms before the start of the examination. Invigilators in the isolation rooms will be required to wear PPE kits, gloves and masks. All invigilators and support staff must be fully vaccinated. The sheets used by the infected examinees will be packed separately. “We have used several classrooms to accommodate the examinees taking the exams in our college. Chairs have been placed at least eight feet apart from each other to create social distancing. Provisions have been made for an isolation room for candidates, who are positive, to take the examinations,” said the principal of a government college.

Both agencies have received a few complaints alleging people in home isolation are stepping out of their homes.The issue came to fore after several complaints reaching police and KMC that people who have tested Covid positive and should remain in home isolation have stepped out, citing personal to medical emergencies, without informing anyone.Among the steps being mulled is police or KMC officials calling on people recovering in home isolation. Police indicated they will also seek the help of housing societies in this. The experience of some cops and councillor’s associates at Ward 83 (Kalighat-Rashbehari) on Friday also pointed to this.On Friday evening, this team had set out — along with the area councillor — to distribute some fruit baskets as a goodwill gesture for Covid patients now in home isolation.“We had visited 20 houses in the Kalighat-Rashbehari belt. Most of the patients were in their homes but in three houses, we found that the Covid patients were not at their residences. While one residing near the 63 Pally club was at the local market, another person — residing on the Kali Temple Road — asked us to come to the local club. A third said he was travelling out of town with some work,” said a team member.The Friday development came days after certain police stations claimed that they have also received complaints from neighbours of Covid patients that their kin were not following the exact rules of quarantine. “Health officials are calling up each patient but that is limited to a conversation over the phone,” said Abirranjan Ghosal, a doctor.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/police-kmc-lens-on-isolation-rule-breach/articleshow/88783418.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The dog is with the Kennedy family that left the Salt Lake home on Saturday and shifted to a relative’s house. Kennedy’s wife too was injured while trying to rein in the dog. The incident happened at the central government employees’ quarter at IC Block when Kennedy allegedly picked up a fight with the president of the housing society association, Sunil Lal. “Kennedy had some previous grudge and picked up a fight with Lal at 11pm. I reached there after receiving a call from Lal. When we asked him to leave, he began abusing us and instructed his dog to attack me,” said Kumar, a coast guard official and association secretary. Bidhannagar south police station booked Kennedy under IPC sections 308 (attempt to commit culpable homicide), 326 (causing grievous hurt) and 289 (negligent conduct with respect to animal). Kennedy’s lawyer Kaushik Das said: “No owner can control an animal absolutely. The dog acted on its own and my client hadn’t instructed it to attack.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/man-held-after-pet-dog-bites-neighbour/articleshow/88783421.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: App complaint option as police stations fight Covid spike||Kolkata: All 79 police stations in the city, including those severely hit by the fresh wave like Bhowanipore and Kasba, have begun accepting complaints on WhatsApp to discourage people from crowding police stations. Lalbazar has now provided each police station with a smartphone with a dedicated number where local residents can lodge complaints and GDs by sending their complaints on WhatsApp. They can also send audio messages as evidence or to lodge a GD. In addition, any photographs that will be used as evidence can also be forwarded on this number. All complaints sent over WhatsApp will be deemed as filed and cops will visit the scene of crime as required. In specific cases of distress or further query, even calls on these numbers will be allowed. On Saturday, two more IPS officers along with other Kolkata Police personnel tested positive for Covid-19. A total of 296 officials have been affected by Covid so far and many have been discharged from hospital. “This is one more initiative on our part to reduce physical contact,” said a joint commissioner. The cops though reminded that the use of this number, in the beginning, will be limited to petty crimes. “For major crimes, our doors will always remain open for complainants,” said an OC from north Kolkata. Primarily, it will be the duty officer who will receive the complaints on WhatsApp and then put up entries. He will also inform senior officers on serious crimes. All the numbers will have the common 8100796 as the initial seven digits. The last three digits will denote the particular division and finally the particular police station. Lalbazar sources said they had already distributed smart phones to all 79 police stations along with new SIM cards. “We will put out the contact number at the gates and at strategic points for the general public by Saturday afternoon,” said an officer at Bhowanipore police station that has reported around 30 Covid cases in the last week. Kolkata Police has announced a number of measures to cut down on physical interaction. Lalbazar has halted the breathalyzer test and asked traffic cops to fall back on citation cases in traffic rather than seizures. The brass has also asked cops not to go out of the city for petty raids and ensure that there is social distancing inside lock-ups. The barracks have been divided to cut down on crowding.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/app-complaint-option-as-police-stns-fight-cov-spike/articleshow/88783423.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Senior citizens can walk into vaccination centres for booster shots||KOLKATA: The state health department, Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) and private healthcare groups are gearing up to administer booster doses from Monday. This time, those eligible for the shot need not register on Co-Win. All they need to do is seek an appointment or schedule the vaccine date on the portal or walk into any CVC for the jab. No senior citizen needs a co-morbidity certificate to get the shot. Hospitals cutting across government and private sectors will be rolling out the booster dose from Monday while the KMC health department will offer the shots at its urban primary health centres in 144 wards. Along with healthcare and frontline workers, senior citizens who had received the second dose nine months ago are eligible for this one. Though the infrastructure for the private sector appears to be ready for the new inoculation drive, the KMC health department is struggling to cope as over 200 KMC doctors and para-medical staffers have recently tested positive for Covid and are spending an isolation period at home. According to sources in the KMC health department, besides invading the civic body’s headquarters, the virus has also affected several executive health officials, medical officers, nurses and other para-medical staffers in the borough level. “At present, we are running short of 200 trained healthcare professionals, both at the headquarters and on the borough level. So, when we open our urban primary health centres for the senior citizens on Monday, we shall be keeping our fingers crossed. Any further deterioration in the situation will definitely lead to cancellation of the vaccination programme at the worst-hit boroughs,” said a KMC health department official. However, the city’s pri-vate healthcare system has assured a hassle-free service from Monday. “For those who cannot book the appointment online on the portal, we request them to bring their vaccination certificates. We are telling senior citizens who are calling up that nine months should have elapsed after they took the second dose,” said Sudipta Mitra, Peerless Hospital CEO. “Our team is ready for the Monday roll-out at four CVCs on Monday. We have two on-site centres — the hospital and our vaccina-tion centre on Alipore Road — and two off-site ones — Quest Mall and IMI campus. We have pulled out the eligible recipients’ list from our database and they have been communicated with accordingly. In addition to the 60-plus recipients, we will be inoculating our own healthcare workers numbering about 2,000 along with frontline workers,” said Rupali Basu, MD and CEO, Woodlands Hospital. Meanwhile, Firhad Hakim has called for all-inclusive vaccination for children aged between 12-18. “This is the need of the hour. I will write to the Union health ministry in this regard,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/senior-citizens-can-walk-into-vax-centres-for-booster-shots/articleshow/88783424.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

On Saturday, several travel agents in the city not only got slots to submit dropbox applications for B1/B2 visa, some even managed to get visa interview slots in February for fresh applications. “I have been trying to get a dropbox slot for days. On Saturday morning, I unexpectedly got slots for two senior citizens who have been waiting to travel to meet their children who live in the US,” said Jaydeep Mukherjee of Meghdutam Travels who had thought that dropbox slots would open after the pressure of students (J/F visa) and employees (H1B). Anil Punjabi of AR-ES Travels also managed to get slots for both depositing dropbox applications and fresh visa interviews. “It is great for senior citizens who have their children settled in the US. In this pandemic situation when there is uncertainty about the future, many have become desperate to get a chance to visit their children. Thankfully, slots are now opening up and they will get to travel,” he said. Sources said the slots opened earlier in the month. The B1/B2 dropbox enables individuals who have earlier travelled to the US or whose visa has either expired recently or is on the verge of expiry to apply for a fresh visa. Though Donald L Heflin, the minister counsellor for consular affairs that is in charge of issuing US visas in India, had clarified that individuals whose visas had expired within the past four years could use the dropbox to apply for a visa, Manav Soni of Exclusive Travels said it was available only for visas that had expired within two years. Officials in the US embassy said the US department of state had authorized consular officers to waive the in-person interview requirement for travellers applying for F, H-1, H-3, H-4, non-blanket L, M, O, P, Q, and academic J visas who were previously issued any type of visas.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/nine-month-wait-ends-as-slots-open-for-us-visa/articleshow/88783425.cms||Subhro Niyogi

While some have set up volunteer forces to help affected families, others have set up isolation rooms. RWAs that had procured oxygen concentrators and cylinders during the second wave have brought them out again in case they are required while others have roped in doctors for online consultations for members. RWAs and block committees have also cancelled several programmes and picnics that are usually held during this time of the year. “We have cancelled several programmes, including a cricket tournament. Currently, we are focussing on reaching out to families who are affected and need help with chores,” said Samir Gupta, secretary of the New Town Citizens’ Welfare Fraternity. “We are arranging online consultation with doctors, ambulance services, collaborating with hospitals and arranging help for families who need to buy essentials but cannot step out,” he said. New Town Forum and News, an NGO in New Town, is providing rapid testing kits to residents in New Town at economical rates. Their volunteers are collecting unused oxygen cylinders and oximeters from families who don’t need them and sharing them with those who do. “We have tied up with doctors and hospitals for online consultations for affected individuals. In many cases, the entire family is down with Covid and need help with buying groceries and medicines. We are assisting them,” said Girish Sharma, secretary of the residents’ welfare association in Sugam Complex in Chetla, which has 64 apartments. Many complexes have set up volunteer forces like they had during the second wave. Their numbers and availability have been circulated among residents on social media groups. “Since I have a vehicle I have opted to purchase medicines for residents. I have work till 5pm, so residents send me their lists during the day and I go out in the evening to buy them,” said Sougata Dey, a resident of Sangam Housing Complex in Ultadanga. At Sukhobrishti in New Town that has over 5,000 apartments, the RWA has set up a volunteer group. “We have a lot of senior citizens here who need assistance with buying essentials or need to get their saturation or blood pressure checked. Our volunteers will assist them,” said Mainak Kanrar, joint secretary of the residents’ association.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/gated-complexes-set-up-covid-volunteer-groups/articleshow/88783426.cms||Zeeshan Javed

This move, they feel, will also help beauticians who have been finding it difficult to make ends meet with the unexpected closure. The notification, however, has no mention on reopening of spas. Beautician Sharmila Singh Flora, who has been running a parlour since 1992, pointed out that this move will help many who were dealing with hairfall issues after Covid. “They have been undergoing treatment and were at a loss when the parlours were suddenly shut. They need to visit the parlours regularly. Pedicure is much in demand during winters. This notification will really affect our clients as well as the workers at salons whose families run on what they earn if the parlours are kept open,” she said. According to Anjali Sambtani, owner of Juice Salon that has two branches in Alipore and Rowland Row, haircuts are currently in high demand. “I am happy that the state government has issued a fresh notification. Our staff is vaccinated and we have been following all the Covid health protocols. To ensure that our parlours operate with 50% capacity, we will work only on appointments,” she said. With the wedding season on, the need for reopening salons was acute. Makeup artist Aniruddha Chakladar insists that a bride needs to visit a parlour regularly before a wedding. “Even those attending weddings need to go to parlours. If weddings are on, salons have to be kept open too,” Chakladar said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/parlours-salons-to-operate-with-50-capacity/articleshow/88783427.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

South City, the largest mall in terms of size and also the most popular in footfall count, witnessed the sharpest plunge in visitors from 4.5 lakh in the Christmas-New Year’s Eve week to around 70,000 in the first week of January. In January 2021, the mall had recorded 4 lakh visitors in the first week. In 2020, the number was 3.2 lakh. “The spurt in infection has left everyone scared. Other than the hypermarket and a few apparel stores selling winter wear, sales are down,” said South City mall vice-president Manmohan Bagree. The worst hit is food and beverage section with food courts going virtually empty in most malls. South City that has a 1,400 seater food court and usually attracts 20,000 customers a day (even during the pandemic) has had just about 1,400 customers walk in the entire day. Quest mall numbers have gone down to 50% than what it was in the last week of December. “Though it will hurt till the third wave lasts, I am confident shoppers will be back with vengeance once infections ebb. The timing isn’t too bad considering it happened during a lean season,” said Quest mall VP Sanjeev Mehra.Acropolis appears to have fared somewhat better with footfall down to 34%. But the food court is badly hit with 80% decline in sales. “The mood in Kolkata from being extraordinarily festive during Christmas and New Year has turned very grim. People are only walking in to purchase essentials,” said mall general manager K Vijayan.City Centre 1 and 2 have also witnessed a 50% footfall reduction. “That we don’t have a shutdown is a big plus. Or else, it is difficult to start from scratch,” said Ambuja Neotia wholetime director Ramesh Pandey. Ujjal, mall in-charge at Forum said, “Given that we are a neighbourhood mall locals are still walking into the food court,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/from-ecstasy-to-agony-rush-goes-missing-at-malls-after-covid-surge/articleshow/88783429.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Kolkata||After bumper Christmas week, fresh curbs hit footfall at restos||Kolkata: The fresh round of curbs following a surge in Covid cases has come as a blow to the food and beverage industry after the Christmas-New Year's Eve high. There has been a 60%-70% dip in business in many bars and restaurants across the city. Restaurant owners feel infections will reach a peak sooner this time and then start dropping gradually from the middle of February. Hotel and Restaurant Association of Eastern India (HRAEI) president Sudesh Poddar, who is the owner of Songhai, Manthan, MS Bar and Lounge, pointed out that footfall had fallen to just 35%-40% of the peak level reached during the Christmas week. Anjan Chatterjee, the chairman of Speciality Restaurants that owns brands like Oh! Calcutta, Mainland China, Haka, Sigree and Café Mezuna, added that there is a 50%-60% fall in most of its properties in the last one week. “Home delivery is saving us. Malls are more impacted than stand-alone restaurants,” he said. Chatterjee felt that looking at the trend of UK, the Covid surge should peak in February and the numbers should come down subsequently. “There is a palpable tension in people and we are getting ready for another survival mode,” he added. The owner of Peter Cat, Mocambo and Peter Hu! Nitin Kothari has also experienced a decline in sales though most of his properties witnesses long queue through the year. “Yes, till January 1, it was fine but after that, there has been a 20% drop,” he added. Chowman, Oudh 1590 and Chapter 2 MD Debaditya Chaudhury agreed that there was a drastic fall. “Our dine-in sale has gone down by 30%. But our delivery has come to a rescue with a 20% jump. There are a good number of online ordering everyday,” he said. KK’s Fusion owner Pradeep Rozario and Go Where owner Rahul Khanna, too, have registered a major dip in footfall.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/after-bumper-christmas-week-fresh-curbs-hit-footfall-at-restos/articleshow/88783431.cms||---

While tech-savvy parties like BJP may be able to exploit it better, others may have to use innovative methods. With a ban on physical rallies till January 15 as of now, social media, local TV channels and local news websites are likely to be the main focus for smaller parties to reach out to voters. Pitted against BJP, which is way ahead in terms of spending and technology for campaigning, most of the other parties, especially smaller entities, have decided to rely on local-level influencers rather than mainstream media to take their message to the people. Going by the speed and scale of the spread of the pandemic, relief seems a distant possibility. Therefore, it is likely that the upcoming polls in five states will go down in history books as the first elections in India without physical rallies. BJP's chief spokesperson and Rajya Sabha MP Anil Baluni said his party had been preparing for digital and virtual campaigns for the past two years since the Covid-19 outbreak. "Our party cadres at the grassroots level have been trained on the latest technologies and how to reach out to people through digital platforms," Baluni told TOI, adding that the party would adhere to Covid guidelines. He said training sessions for virtual campaigns had been organised at all party offices, including at the booth level. TMC MP and spokesperson Derek O'Brien said even giant screens cannot be used as they will attract gatherings and turn into Covid super spreaders. "The first priority should be to follow Covid protocol to the hilt," he told TOI. "We will not let out our exact strategy and allow BJP to borrow our ideas, but we will certainly not use Tek Fog-type applications that spread hate and vicious propaganda," he said. PM Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah, defence minister Rajnath Singh, Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath have been holding rallies and other events across UP for almost a month in the run-up to the poll date announcement. Stating that the EC should ensure a level playing field, leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha, Mallikarjun Kharge said, "PM Modi already held various political rallies. He's been touring for the past month and has visited UP more than 10-15 times... Only financially weaker parties will face problems; the party in office is comfortable." SP president Akhilesh Yadav appealed to the EC to ensure that regional parties get proper space on digital platforms. While he said the EC should assist smaller parties with limited resources, AIMIM president Asaduddin Owaisi said he was hopeful that the EC would review its guidelines after January 15 keeping in mind the digital divide in India, especially in UP.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/digital-divide-may-give-bjp-an-edge-others-will-have-to-innovate-to-click/articleshow/88783447.cms||Akhilesh Singh

Morning walkers were horrified to find a man lying dead, with his throat slit. The victim hasn’t been identified yet. Save for a tattoo with the alphabet ‘A’, there are no identifying marks. This is Bhopal’s first murder case of 2022. Kerwa Dam Road in Ratibad is a favourite with morning walkers and cyclists. Hundreds of them visit the area every day. On Saturday, passersby found the corpse near a culvert between Sakshi Dhaba and a residential colony around 11am, said Ratibad SHO Sudesh Tiwari.

There were signs he was brutally attacked. His throat was slit almost from ear to ear. From the depth of the cut, police suspect a heavy blade was used. Circumstantial evidence suggests he had drinks with someone near the spot after which he was murdered. Police found empty liquor bottles, water pouches and snacks. The body lay around 200 feet from the culvert, said SHO Tiwari. There were signs of a struggle and the victim’ footwear lay nearby. Police believe there were multiple assailants.

As per official figures there were 5,044 active cases in the state on January 8. Eight days ago, on December 31 there were only 407 active cases in the state. Active case count has grown more than 12-fold or has seen an increase of more than 1100 % in just 8 days. The troubling part is the fact that as on January 8, 47 of the 52 districts of the state at least had one active Covid-19 patient. Now only five districts namely Panna, Mandla, Harda, Dindori and Agar Malwa have zero active Covid-19 patient. This has also grown exponentially as on January 1, only around 25 districts had active patients. Covid-19 is now spreading even to smaller districts of the state. And more than 90% of the state is already under the grip of the infection. Now more than 90% of the districts are under the grip of Covid-19 as only 5 districts have zero Covid-19 cases in state. If we compare this with health department statistics fom a month ago, only 6 districts in the first week of December had active Covid-19 patients. However, probably due to full vaccination of more than 92% of the eligible population in the state, hospitalization rates are lower so far this time compared to the previous waves of Covid-19. Of the total 5,044 active patients, only 376 were in hospitals as on January 8, and of these, only 47 were in ICUs. Sources said that overall only around 45 patients were on oxygen support on January 8. More than 75% of those who have been infected in the month of January so far are those who are already fully vaccinated, added sources. But given the infectious nature of the disease and less known impact of the new variants, it is high time that people should strictly adhere to Covid-19 appropriate behaviour, wearing masks, maintaining social distance and also maintaining hand hygiene, there is no other alternative, added sources.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/covid-cases-in-mp-show-12-fold-rise-in-8-days/articleshow/88783463.cms||Amarjeet Singh

The school education department has now approached the women and child development department for help.As per official records, there was around 22% dropout rate in Madhya Pradesh as far as Class 10 is concerned. While launching, the vaccination of these students was a big challenge. The school education department claimed that they have achieved over70% vaccination in the 15-18 years age group. However, when it comes to the vaccination of dropouts things are a bit dicey. “As per available records of students, before they left, we tried to contact them. Few of them have been traced. We have also taken the help of NGOs to help in taking such students to the nearest vaccination centre. However, there are many children who are untraceable as either their addresses have been changed or they have left the state,” said DEO Bhopal, Nitin Saxena. A senior education department official on the condition of anonymity said that achieving 100% vaccination of the 15-18 years age group is a challenging task. “I do not think 100% vaccination is possible for the 15-18 years age group as dropouts are untraceable. To achieve 100% vaccination will require a mammoth task,” said the official. “We will take help from women and child development department. Their workers will help in tracing the students eligible in the 15-18 years age group. We have made a roadmap to connect with such age group drop-out students.” There are around 700 schools in Bhopal wherein 1 lakh students (excluding the dropouts) have to be vaccinated in the age group of 15-18 years. In Bhopal district, there are 40,297 students in the 15-18 years age group. The vaccination against Covid-19 of 36 lakh schoolchildren in the 15-18 age group in Madhya Pradesh began on January 3.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/vax-drive-hits-hurdle-as-dropouts-missing/articleshow/88783464.cms||Ramendra Singh

The principal of the school said that on January 3, when vaccination was launched, 200 students out of 237 students were vaccinated in one go. “On January 3, several students and parents did not agree to send their kids for vaccination. We told them it is important for the safety of their children. However, several children did not take the jab saying they were not well, but they promised the teachers they would complete the vaccination soon,” said the principal. “The issue began when we followed it up with their parents. A few parents agreed to get their wards vaccinated. However, the children refused and without informing anyone left the campus,” the principal added. Later, some of them took the jab. Teachers tried their best to convince parents, but in vain. “As one of the parents was creating a scene on the campus, I had to allow the girl to go home. There are still 27 students on the school campus who are yet to be vaccinated, the principal added. DEO Bhopal Nitin Saxena said that school staff was trying their best to convince parents for the vaccination but several have refused. “Our staff is also limited as they can’t force anyone to take the vaccine. Still, we are trying to convince them,” said DEO Saxena.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/drama-at-school-as-kids-refuse-to-get-jabbed/articleshow/88783468.cms||---

Due to the loss and financial crisis, the farmers stopped cultivating paddy and started cultivating other crops, including tapioca and sweet potatoes. However, the panchayat is now in the process of reviving paddy farming.As the fields are so close to the Vellayani backwaters, most of the fields were flooded and the crops were destroyed. Sadanandan C was one among the farmers who changed to other crop cultivation after going through financial loss. Now, he has decided to resume paddy cultivation in his 15 cents of land.The paddy cultivation has been re-launched as part of the panchayat’s aim to promote paddy cultivation. The Venganoor panchayat has started creating awareness among the farmers about the importance of paddy cultivation and also the fact that paddy is the only crop which suits the geography of the area. Along with promoting paddy cultivation, the panchayat aspires to achieve self-sufficiency in rice production. Sadanandan C was the first one to come forward for paddy cultivation. The cultivation has been launched in the month of December. They have used the paddy variety named ´Thavalakannan´, which they have sourced from a Thiruvananthapuram-based farmer.“I have been cultivating paddy for so many years and the continuous loss made me think about other crops. But I have understood that no other crops can be cultivated in this area due to the geographic conditions. So, I have decided to cultivate paddy whether it will be a loss or profit. But I am not ready to leave the land unproductive,” said Sadanandhan C. “We have started convincing all the farmers of the panchayat to re-launch paddy cultivation. Due to the geographic limitations of the area, other crops will not sustain. Therefore if we are able to restore the paddy fields, that will be a great achievement. As Sadanandhan has stepped forward, we believe that other farmers will also start doing paddy cultivation once again,” said R S Sreekumar, Venganoor panchayath president.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/panchayat-on-a-mission-to-revive-paddy-farming/articleshow/88783471.cms||---

A hurried enquiry by DEOs yielded a figure that was a little above 1,100 and counting. Among cities, the highest was reported from Surat, with 532 cases, while there were roughly 45 confirmed in Ahmedabad, 50 in Gandhinagar and 83 in Rajkot. Secretary (primary and secondary education) Dr Vinod Rao confirmed, “The data for Covid-infected children in schools was not being sought as there was no need felt. Schools were regularly reporting their attendance.” Highly placed sources in the education department revealed to TOI that a little above 1,100 cases have already been reported from all major and small towns and taluka offices to the chief secretary, and the number is likely to rise. Surprisingly, senior educational officials at the ‘command and control centre 2.0’ (CCC 2.0) set up by education department in sector 19 in Gandhinagar had not been officially registering Covid infections in government and private schools. In fact, it was when chief secretary Pankaj Kumar sought details that the exercise of identifying school-going children infected by Covid was carried out. When asked the capabilities of CCC 2.0, the official said it had been set up in 2018 and upgraded in June 2021. It covers government and grant-in-aid school. During Covid, it gathered information on attendance from private schools in major Gujarat cities. “The CCC 2.0 is capable of overseeing performance of 54,000 schools and 3 lakh teachers, real-time monitoring of educational activities and even child tracking, but there was no instruction to record children attending offline classes testing Covid positive,” said a senior primary education department official.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||No respite in violent crimes: Goons target cop’s family||Thiruvananthapuram: The incidence of violent crimes that spiked toward the end of the previous year under rural police district limits seems to have entered the new year with the same momentum, raising concerns over the law and order situation in the district. The latest incident reported on Saturday is an attack on the family of a female police officer attached to Parassala police station at Dhanuvachapuram. The incident occurred just three days after a gang of goons terrorised the families residing near CRPF camp at Mangalapuram after barging into their homes with weapons.According to police, the attack was faced by the family of Sheeja, a civil police officer attached to the Parassala station. The assailants had targeted her brother, Bijumon. CPO Sheeja and Bijumon’s wife, also named Sheeja, were beaten up when they tried to intervene to save him from the attack. Bijumon was beaten up using iron rods and boulders. It was around 10 pm on Friday, a gang of eight men barged into the residence of Bijumon. According to him, the gang was led by his neighbour Shibin. A few days ago, the same gang had committed a similar offence at another house in the locality and they suspected that Bijumon had informed the police about it. This is suspected to be the provocation for the attack.Meanwhile, the police have managed to arrest one of the assailants after he was apprehended and handed over by the local residents. The accused has been identified as Satheesan, 21, of Manchavilakom. He is reportedly a habitual offender involved in similar cases in the past too.Speaking to TOI, rural district police chief SP Divya V Gopinath said that while the incident reported at Mangalapuram was a criminal gang activity, the one at Dhanuvachapuram cannot be considered so.‘’It is learned that the attack was spurred by personal rivalry between members of two families in the same locality,’’ the SP said. However, the police are not taking these things very seriously. Even though the special drive Operation Trojan, carried out last month to curb criminal activities concluded by December 31, the police have not let their guard down.‘’We are maintaining the same vigil and action against habitual offenders and criminal activities are still going on,’’ the Superintendent said.Regarding the criminal activity at Mangalapuram, she said that the police have already taken measures to cancel bail of the key accused pertaining to all his previous cases and also initiated steps to invoke KAAPA laws in his name.‘’He is an accused in a total of 13 previous cases out of which he secured bail in eight. We have filed a report before the court seeking to cancel the bail on account of violating bail bond,’’ the SP said.The unusual number of grave crimes reported in the rural district in the recent past had resulted in the police receiving criticism from all corners, including the state High Court and even cabinet ministers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/no-respite-in-violent-crimes-goons-target-cops-family/articleshow/88783478.cms||---

By Monday, the Samras boys’ hostel will be ready for patients requiring oxygen. More than 200 PG students from AMC-MET are being roped in to manage Sanjivani Raths, and a majority of contractual paramedics who were asked to leave last month are being recruited back on special agreements to manage Covid patients under home isolation. AMC has calculated that by January 25, burgeoning Covid cases will require additional human resources to manage patients who may be under home quarantine. As of now, the phase-wise staff reduction at SVP hospital has been stayed. Of the 1,100 paramedics whose contracts ended last month, close to 300 may be recruited. Sources claim that employment agreements for these paramedics will not be for 11 months, and no advertisements will be placed for recruitment. Sources in AMC-Medical Education Trust confirmed 240 PG medical students have agreed to join the raths. The AMC-MET official said, “During the second wave, the students helped in managing hundreds of cases at home so that government infrastructure was not flooded with patients.” When TOI visited Samras hostel in Gujarat University complex on 132-feet Ring Road, an AMC official said that the oxygen line at the hostel is being readied. “We are looking to shift non-critical patients from SVP hospital so that infrastructure there is strained,” claimed the AMC official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/fired-last-month-paramedics-called-back-to-battle-ncov-surge/articleshow/88783480.cms||---

This has pushed up the sales of rapid testing kits. Estimates of Federation of Gujarat State Chemists and Druggists’ Association (FGSCDA) suggest that at least 50,000 testing kits are being sold across the state every single day. Alpesh Patel, president, FGSCDA, said: “People are keeping these kits at home as a precautionary measure, despite the efficacy of such tests.” Patel added: “Since the number of Covid-19 cases are increasing rapidly, instead of going to Covid-19 testing booths set up by civic authorities or to urban health centres, people who can afford these kits are testing themselves at home.” He went on to say: “Most people who have mild symptoms want to be doubly sure and hence purchase these kits. Those who are health conscious also tend to buy the kits.” At least four to five pharmaceutical companies manufacture such kits which are readily available in the market and cost in the range of Rs 250 to Rs 350 per kit. Individual chemists in Ahmedabad confirmed that five to 10 kits are being sold every day since the past week, in the wake of the surge in cases. “Over the past five days, at least five kits are being sold over the counter from our store daily,” said a chemist in Prahladnagar. “People who are aware of such kits are buying them as part of their monthly medical supplies. Those who travel frequently keep these kits handy.” Yogesh Patel, a Navrangpura chemist, said: “I sold about 100 kits over the past five days. People buy them as a precautionary measure.” Chemists say that people who tend to travel frequently for work or have elderly family members are being extra cautious and those with symptoms are now beginning to test at home before opting for RT-PCR tests.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/rapid-test-at-home-kits-flying-off-the-shelves/articleshow/88783483.cms||Niyati Parikh

---||Ahmedabad||Online study not enough, design students move Gujarat HC||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court issued notice to Karnavati University and the University Grants Commission (UGC) after two students filed petitions demanding refund of fees on the grounds of the deficiency of online education in teaching the subject of designing and that their parents’ income fell in Covid-19 times, resulting in them opting to cancel their admissions. According to the case details, two students from Indore – Anushka Jain and Ashree Neema – took the entrance test in January 2020 for designing courses offered by Unitedworld Institue of Design of Karnavati University in Gandhinagar. In April, they were told that they had succeeded and would be granted admission. They chose a four-year degree course in designing. They paid Rs 1 lakh fees in May 2020. On July 23, 2020, the university informed them that their education programme would begin two weeks later. These students were not comfortable with the online mode of education. It was the only mode of teaching permitted by the governments due to the prevailing Covid situation in 2020. They decided to cancel their admission and their parents sought a refund of the fees from the university in August 2020, which the university apparently refused. They also cited their weakened financial conditions due to the pandemic and restrictions imposed to control the spread of the virus. When they did not receive the refund for over a year, both students moved the high court in December 2021 through advocate Anvesh Vyas, who argued that the design course opted for by the students cannot be taught properly online as it requires a practical approach. Besides, the parents of these students also struggled like many others in their businesses and suffered drastic reductions in their incomes. The lawyer cited a circular issued by the UGC on December 17, 2020, directing all universities, including private ones, to refund the entire fees if students opt to cancel or migrate up to December 31, 2020. Provisions for refund of fees were made especially for that academic year due to the Covid pandemic. The HC is to hear this case further on January 12.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/online-study-not-enough-design-students-move-hc/articleshow/88783486.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Ordinance to amend land-grab law soon||GANDHINAGAR: After a reprimand from the Gujarat high court over large scale misuse of the Gujarat Land Grabbing (Prohibition) Act, 2020, the Gujarat government plans to amend controversial provisions of the act through an ordinance, which is likely to be issued this week. Earlier, the state government assured the HC that it would make necessary remedial changes to the act. Key sources in the state government said, “The ordinance draft is almost ready and will be announced shortly. All key directions of the high court for amendment to the act have been included in the proposed ordinance, which will is likely be approved by the state cabinet next week.” Sources said the major amendment will be to mention that if a person of a scheduled tribe has a land encroachment civil suit pending against him or her, the person will not be booked again under the act. “All action will be followed under provisions of earlier existing laws only. Several incidences of unwarranted cases of land grabbing against tribal persons have been reported which were already pending for decisions under other acts like the Forest Rights Act etc,” added a source. A key source further said, “There are several other issues in the implementation of the land grabbing law which are not related to provisions of the act. For instance, there are ambiguities or lacunae, which could lead police or civil authorities to misuse provisions of the law. At present, filling of cases against anyone under the act is done only after approval by an authorized committee, but it has been noted that various districts follow different yardsticks for invoking sections of the act. By the amendment in the rules, the government aims to have a uniform process across the state,” the source added. “The government aims to make provision in the amendment or rules to prevent misuse of the act by police or civil authorities to extort money from the people using the threat of the law,” sources informed. The high court drew the government’s attention to this provision of the law after a lawyer argued about hindrances that the anti-land grabbing laws have created in regularising possession of agricultural land for tribal persons. In this case, a trust had taken a parcel of land on a 99-year lease in 1966, and after enactment of this law, the trust was dubbed a land grabber. The law has been under question for various reasons, mainly for unsettling settled disputes by its overriding effect on pending civil disputes and decrees of civil courts. Lawyers termed this law “draconian” and submitted how Gujarat has adopted few safeguards, compared to other states.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/ordinance-to-amend-land-grab-law-soon/articleshow/88783489.cms||Kapil Dave

Assistant registrar Neelambuj Sahai, in his complaint with Naranpura police, stated during an investigation he realised that certain Chinese directors were involved in money laundering with the help of some Indian directors and visa facilitators. He stated that certain companies were operating in India without disclosing their source of income and were not paying any income tax, for last two years. He stated that it was also revealed that these companies were reducing their tax burden by presenting falsified books of account and expenditure statements. Sahai stated that it was established that some chartered accountancy firms were helping such companies to get set up and have their documentation done. Such companies would initially have Indian directors on the board. They would then resign and and be replaced by Chinese directors. Such Chinese directors were involved in money laundering. He stated that central agencies informed the ROC here that they had got several statements of people who admitted to being such dummy directors. These dummy directors were getting some benefits for the use of their names. He stated that it was revealed that Ting Liang Cheng, who was on a B1 Visa, was not permitted to work in India but despite this he was shown as director of FCS Machinery India, which is located in Vasna.

But what brings us joy spells havoc for birds across the city. According to Jivdaya Charitable Trust (JCT) in Ahmedabad, as many as 547 cases birds were reported injured in the first week of January itself. The trend is almost at par with the same period last year when around 700 cases were reported in the first 10 days of January. This means an estimated 50-70 cases of bird injuries are reported in a day and most of them are caused by manja (glass-coated kite strings). Birds which are commonly found injured include crows, pigeons, ibis, parrots, kites, cormorants, owls, and green pigeons. Moumita, a programme manager at JCT, said, “Most birds get injured after being stuck in a tangle of manja which is found in trees, bushes and even on roads and along terrace walls. The more they try to free themselves and flap their wings, the greater the degree of injury as the thread saws into the wound.” Around 10% of the injured birds have died of grave injuries. “The number of cases are almost the same as last year’s. Thankfully, we have more volunteers this time to help us handle bird injuries as well as conduct rescues. We have been repeatedly urging people against using sharp, glass-coated or plastic threads to fly kites. We are also exhorting them to be mindful of the time when flying kites,” said Gira Shah, a trustee at JCT. Several rare birds are also found injured around this time of the year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/manja-injures-506-birds-in-one-week/articleshow/88783497.cms||Niyati Parikh

The driver of the SUV, Tilak Lakhani, was rescued by the fire department using hydraulic cutters. After the collision, Tilak legs were pinned as the vehicles engine and the dashboard buckled inwards due to the collision.

G K Bharwad, police inspector of SG Road I Division traffic police station said according to the complainant, Tilak saw the tyre of the truck ahead of him fail and the truck veered towards the right.

Darshan stated that when he reached the Sola overbridge, he found his son pinned in the car and fire brigade jawans were trying to rescue him. Darshan said Tilak was conscious, and was thus able to narrate what happened to him. Darshan stated that Tilak was heading towards Adani Shantigram at about 11.30am when the accident occurred. Rajesh Bhatt, chief fire officer of Ahmedabad Fire and Emergency Services, said the youth was badly pinned between engine and the seat.

Being four-over for the event after three holes on Saturday, the 20-year-old fought his way to the top of the leaderboard thereafter with a chip-in eagle on the 14th and four birdies to register a 68, the lowest round of the event.Bais, who turned professional in 2019, said, “I’m very pleased with my performance as I played competitive golf after a long time.

Visakhapatnam district alone reported 1,211 cases, accounting for more than 25% of the total cases surfaced in the state last year. Of the nearly 1,300 malaria cases reported in AP in 2021, Visakhapatnam contributed more than 830 cases. The state conducted 86,321 tests and detected these 4,754 dengue cases with an average case positivity rate of 5.5%. But Visakhapatnam registered a grim 13.5% dengue positivity rate as the 1,211 cases were detected of 8,974 tests carried out in the district. Anantapur, which added 178 dengue cases to the tally, recorded the lowest positivity rate of 1.24%. Even though Guntur district recorded only 650 cases, it posted the highest case positivity rate of 15.2%. There were no dengue-related deaths in the state in 2021. Andhra Pradesh recorded 4,011 dengue cases in 2018 and 5,286 cases in 2019. As the state’s health machinery was fully involved in the management of the then newly emerged Covid-19 pandemic, dengue testing took a backseat in 2020. And consequently, the state detected only 925 cases in 2020. But the health officials paid equal attention to vector-borne disease management in 2021. Visakhapatnam district has been traditionally contributing a major chunk of the vector-borne disease in the state. Health officials attribute the trend to increased urbanisation as well as the district having a mix of urban, rural and tribal pockets. Aedes aegypti, which causes diseases like dengue fever, chikungunya, Zika fever, etc. is a highly domesticated urban mosquito. While Vizag city is contributing to a huge number of dengue cases, the tribal and rural parts of the district are witnessing a spurt in malaria cases. For instance, over 60% of the total malaria cases reported in the state in 2021 are from Visakhapatnam district. These primarily emerged from the rural and tribal areas of the district. The Union health ministry deputed multidisciplinary teams to various states and Union territories between August and November 2021. The teams observed that prolonged and intermittent rains resulted in high dengue vector density due to a large number of breeding places. The teams also noted that the vector borne disease field staff were involved in duties assigned for various activities for Covid-19, which in turn affected public health measures for the prevention and control of dengue. They also observed gaps in the monitoring of key entomological indicators, which provide early warning signals about the abundance of vector density.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/dengue-and-malaria-sting-vizag-more-than-other-dists/articleshow/88783513.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

This did not go down well with a section of the mob who lynched him.”While speaking to reporters at the BJP’s state headquarters, the BJP leader also accused the police of working hand in glove with the conspirators of the lynching incident. “Thetaitangar police came from Bambalkera village with the crowd of 500 people and stood as silent spectators as the entire event unfolded,” he alleged and accused the police of shielding the guilty.“The wife of the deceased, Sapna Devi, said one man, identified as Suban Budh, was the prime conspirator as he thrashed Sunju, dragged him by the hair and set him ablaze. Yet, the police have not arrested him and framed the relatives of Sanju from Chaprideepa village,” Marandi claimed.Marandi also claimed that the police and the administration were trying to cover up the incident by circulating false stories that Sanju was involved in the felling of sacred trees. “Pradhan had felled trees many months ago to build a house. The forest guards had confiscated them soon after,” he added.Meanwhile, former CM Raghubar Das also visited Besrajara village and demanded Rs 10 lakh compensation and a government job for Sanju’s kin under the new anti-lynching laws of the state. “It was a cold-blooded murder. BJP will launch stirs in front of the SP’s office if the innocent men, who have been wrongly arrested by the police, are not released within 48 hours,” Das said.Notably, Simdega police had arrested three persons — Lodhe Pradhan, who happens to the uncle of Sanju, Maheshwar Pradhan and Niripati Pradhan — in connection with the mob lynching case on Wednesday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/simdega-man-was-lynched-as-he-protested-against-cow-slaughter/articleshow/88783526.cms||Dhritiman Ray

A total of 688 applications were submitted to the RMC.Talking to TOI, assistant municipal commissioner Jyoti Kumar Singh said the RMC has approved 144 applications of the fruits and vegetable vendors as prescribed. He said, “A total of 688 applications had come to us. But those applicants were mixed which means that we wanted applications of the ones who are into fruits and vegetables. Also, instead of the Nagababa Khatal locality, the applicants were from all across the city. After sorting, we have shortlisted 144 applications which actually are the ones who sells fruits and vegetables in that area. Nine of them are fruit sellers while the remaining are vegetable sellers. They are the people who were actually vending fruits and vegetables in Nagababa Khatal during the 2016 survey.”The civic body came up with a dedicated vegetable market where over 300 sellers, who operate out of a road opposite Raj Bhavan, could relocate, ensuring that Kishoreganj on Ratu Road will finally be opened up to ensure smooth flow of traffic.

---||Ranchi||Experts bat for vax efficacy amid surge||RANCHI: Even as the number of Covid-19 cases are rising in a steep number and infecting even those who are fully vaccinated, healthcare experts have urged people not to lose faith in the efficacy of the vaccines as ‘they have a role to play in reducing the severity of the infection’. On Friday, as many as 3825 new cases were reported in the state and over the past week, there have been an average of 2,473 cases per day, an increase of 771% from what the average was two weeks earlier. As of Friday evening, there have been at least 369,049 cases and 5,161 deaths in Jharkhand since the beginning of the pandemic in 2020, according to MOHFW. This sharp rise in infection at a time when at least 71% of the eligible population have taken their jab and 44% are fully vaccinated is creating apprehensions about the efficacy of the vaccines among people. On Saturday afternoon, state health minister Banna Gupta, who is doubly vaccinated, said that he has tested positive for Covid. Experts believe that the vaccines cannot prevent the infection but they can help in reducing the virus’s severity. “Breakthrough infections are always reported but we have to see if the cases are becoming serious,” the head of preventive social medicine department at Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences, Ranchi, Dr Devesh Kumar, said. He added, “Out of the 750 deaths reported in Rims during the second wave of the pandemic last year, which was triggered by the lethal Delta variant, 739 had not taken the vaccine and the rest had taken just the first dose and they contracted Covid within 14 days of taking the jab. Those who were fully vaccinated did not succumb to the virus.” As of date, the number of hospital admissions is far less than the number of positive cases. According to the report released by Ranchi sadar hospital, only 24 beds were occupied by Covid patients till 3pm on Saturday and none among them were on oxygen support or on ventilator. At Rims, as many as seven patients were in ICU, out of which four were on oxygen support. “Those admitted in ICU are there because they have co-morbidities and not because of lung congestion,” Dr Kumar said. Additional chief secretary (health) Arun Kumar Singh, who has sought a detailed report from all the districts their preparedness, availability of oxygen and ICU beds, their vaccination status and the severity of the infection, told TOI that the present strain is affecting all, irrespective of their vaccination status or their previous infection. “The severity is not fatal and vaccines must be playing a decisive role in it,” he said. Association of Private Healthcare Providers of India’s president (Jharkhand unit) Jogesh Gambhir said that many patients coming to the hospital are vaccinated. “But the number is far less than what was the scenario during the second wave and most of these patients have co-morbid conditions,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/experts-bat-for-vax-efficacy-amid-surge/articleshow/88783531.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

The workers have said their strike will continue till HEC gives a written assurance that their wages will be paid. The management, however, said that barring a few disturbances by some undesirable elements at a particular shop floor which were immediately sorted out, production across its three units was mostly normal on Saturday. HEC’s director (personnel) M K Saxena said, “Production at all the three units — foundry and forge plant, heavy machine tools plant and heavy machine buildings plant — have already clocked 90% normalcy.” Saxena further said the management had issued an appeal on Friday, asking the workers to resume work with an assurance that one month’s wages would be paid to all the workers, including the contractual ones, on January 10. However, a sizeable section of the workers abandoned work on Saturday, burned copies of the ‘appeal’ issued by the management and stressed that their strike would continue till a formal agreement was signed by HEC with the representatives of trade unions spelling out modalities of the payment of wages. “Five of the seven trade unions at HEC - Hatia Mazdoor Union, HEC Shramik Sangh, Hatia Lok Manch, Bhartiya Kaamgar Union and Janata Mazdoor Union -- are continuing with their indefinite strike that had commenced on December 2,” Harendra Yadav, who is the working president, of Hatia Mazdoor Union, said, adding, “We are also going ahead with our proposed gherao of the HEC corporate headquarters at Dhurwa on January 10 to put further pressure on the management.” The president of the CITU-affiliated Hatia Mazdoor Union, Bhawan Singh, appealed to the management to adopt a more flexible attitude to put an end to the strike.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/production-resumes-at-hec-amid-fresh-strike/articleshow/88783533.cms||Tapas Biswas

We are carrying out a detailed survey to decide the quantum of compensation to the affected farmers,” Ujjain divisional commissioner Sandeep Yadav told TOI. The prevailing weather condition is also likely to have an adverse effect on crops like wheat, gram, opium, fenugreek, garlic, and onion. Several farmers in Mandsaur, Neemuch, Ratlam and Ujjain districts posted videos and pictures of hailstorm hitting their crop late on Friday night on social media platforms. On Saturday morning, farmers of Sedrafanda and Khajuri areas of Mandsaur district staged a chakkajam demanding compensation for their loss. Later, collector Gautam Singh led a revenue team that took stock of the crop loss in rural areas. Cabinet ministers Jagdish Devda and Hardeep Singh Dang, who are MLAs from Mandsaur’s Malhargarh and Suwasra constituencies, assured the affected farmers of financial help for the crop loss. Indore-based farmer Hindu Singh Choudhary, who has taken 12 bigha farmland in Ujjain district’s Limbapipliya village on annual lease and has sown wheat and garlic on it, told TOI, “Hailstorm has damaged 80% of garlic and about 50% wheat crop.

This is unlike the neighbouring districts where tourism activities have been allowed by the tourism department. Meanwhile, on Day-1 of the weekend curfew, Mysuru was shut while resorts, tiger safaris, and other tourism activities were allowed. This is likely to help Chamarajanagar, Hassan, Kodagu, and Chikkamagaluru districts where tourism is not restricted to urban areas, which are closed. In Mysuru, major tourist destinations such as the Mysuru palace, Mysuru zoo and rail museum, were shut. The city roads wore a deserted look as the KSRTC urban and rural divisions operated fewer buses and only on important routes. Authorities said passenger occupancy was very less and the situation is likely to continue on Sunday. According to Mysuru District Hotel Owners’ Asociation president C Narayana Gowda, for the last two days, the hotel occupancy rate is below 10%. “Only a handful of tourists are staying back. There are no fresh check-ins,” he said. BS Prashanth, honorary president of Mysuru Travels Association, said if the tourism department had issued a circular allowing resorts, safaris three days earlier, the situation would have been very different. “Assuming total weekend curfew, many tourists canceled their check ins and tourist plans. The situation reached such a point where all the stakeholders are forced to move out of the business,” he said. Major temples of the region including Chamundi Hills, MM Hills and Nanjangud saw very low footfalls. Only darshan was allowed and no special poojas were conducted. Safari activity in forests is allowed during the curfew. The safari at Bandipur attracted a good crowd on Saturday. Authorities said there was no change in the demand for the safari tickets. However, in Nagarahole, tourists did not turn up for safari, said ACFO Gopal. In Hassan, the tourist flow was down by 10-15% on Saturday. While ASI monuments were closed, those who had booked resorts and home stays have already reached their destinations. They will be leaving on Monday. As Hassan lies between Chikkamagaluru and Bengaluru, more vehicles move towards Chikkamagaluru, those who take a diversion to Sakleshpur were less in number. Trekkers who wish to carry venture out near Sakleshpur during the weekend, are allowed with the condition that they follow Covid norms. “Those who want to come in the morning and leave in the evening are not allowed. Considering regular tourists flow, about 10 - 15 % is the reduction due to the restrictions”, said Tourism Deputy Director Sanjay. Tourism activities were completely stopped in Chikkamagaluru. In Kodagu, despite vigilant checking in check posts by police, the movement of vehicles and people was not obstructed except those moving around unnecessarily. Police placed barricades in Madikeri to check tourist vehicles coming from other places and after an inquiry, they were allowed. District homestay association president retired Col Bharath said many tourists who had booked rooms had cancelled immediately after the government announced the curfew. “The tourism department had said tourists who had already booked will be allowed. Despite this, many tourists have cancelled bookings because tourist spots are closed,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/surging-covid-cases-and-curbs-hit-tourism-sector-in-mysuru-city/articleshow/88783546.cms||---

Authorities in the border district have stepped up vigilance to ensure that the infection does not spread unchecked in Chamarajanagar.Intent on mitigating the impact of the expected third wave, the district administration has already reserved 1,115 beds, of which 148 are in the intensive care unit (ICU), 58 with ventilator and oxygen support across private and government hospitals.During the height of the second wave, there were allegations of oxygen shortage at hospitals in the district. It was in Chamarajanagar that 24 Covid patients passed away owing to shortage of oxygen in May 2020. Officials in the health department are taking all care to prevent such incidents from recurring during the third wave. With experts pointing out that children may be vulnerable to the infection during the third wave, the authorities have reserved 49 beds in the ICU, 24 oxygenated beds and two beds in the ventilator support, exclusively for children.The authorities in Chamarajanagar have kept a 6,000-litre oxygen tank on the premises of the old district hospital on B Rachaiah Road, in addition to a tank that holds 20,000 litres at the Chamarajanar Institute of Medical Sciences in Yedabetta. Furthermore, 792 jumbo oxygen cylinders, 297 B model oxygen cylinders and 564 oxygen concentrators have been kept ready. The authorities have made similar arrangements at the taluk hospitals in Kollegal and Gundlupet, and the Santemarahalli Lake Community Health Centre. Many private organisations have lent invaluable assistance to the district administration in its endeavour.Chamarajanagar district health officer Dr KM Visveswariah told TOI, “Following directions from the Karnataka health department, we have been paying attention to ensure that the eligible population have received both doses of the vaccination. We are intent on covering the people in the 177 villages that share border with Tamil Nadu and Kerala, in addition to inoculating teenagers in the 15-18 age group.”The district administration has also stepped up its drive against people not adhering to safety norms.Of the 7-8 lakh people eligible to receive the vaccination, 98% have received the first dose, while 78% have been fully vaccinated. So far, more than 18,000 in the 15-18 age group have also been vaccinated. The district has also stocked enough medicine, while ASHA workers and other staff have been imparted training to tackle the third wave.CIMS dean and director Dr Sanjiv told TOI, “We have equipped the hospital with all the necessary facilities, and made all preparations to treat infected patients. We have also opened 16 Covid Care Centres, and the district administration has decided to utilise the expertise and services of CIMS staff.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/cnagar-prepared-to-tackle-surge-in-cases/articleshow/88783548.cms||---
---||Mysuru||In third wave, 22% Covid patients hospitalised in Mysuru||MYSURU: Although it is widely believed that hospitalisation of Covid patients is low during third wave, in Mysuru, out of 484 active cases, 109 are hospitalised — around 22.5% patients.

---||Mysuru||Farmers dismayed as price of banana crashes||S Ramesh Mysuru: Farmers engaged in the cultivation of banana in Mysuru and Chamarajanagar districts are an anxious lot, with the price of the tropical fruit going on a downward spiral. With the state government imposing more curbs to check the spread of Covid-19, farmers fear that their difficulties may only increase over the next few weeks.The ‘elakki’ banana, which is among the most popular varieties of the fruit in the state, which was being sold on the wholesale market for Rs 35/kg, is now being sold at Rs 16/kg, leaving farmers who had hoped for a handsome profit dismayed. Meanwhile, farmers are selling the ‘pacchabale’ for Rs 8 to Rs 12 per kg, whereas Horticulture Producers’ Marketing Society (Hopcoms) is offering farmers Rs 7/kg. However, farmers have pointed out that, while the ‘elakki’ banana is being sold for Rs 40 to Rs 50/kg on the retail market, they are being paid less than half that sum by the wholesale traders.Cumulatively, banana is cultivated across 15,00 hectares across Mysuru and Chamarajanagar districts. In fact, a large number of farmers in the two districts turned away from conventional crops, and took to growing banana, largely attracted by the attractive price it was fetching on the market.Farmers were shocked when the price of the ‘elakki’ banana crashed to Rs 14 to Rs 16 per kg at the Mandi Market. Owing to the long spell of unseasonal showers in the Old Mysore region, the quality of the yield that many cultivators got did not live up to their expectations, said Mahadevaiah, who is engaged in the cultivation of bananas in Bommanaiakanahalli in T Narasipura taluk.Mariswamy, a farmer from Kesthur in Yelandur, Chamarajanagar, said that buyers in Mysuru had offered up to Rs 50 for the ‘elakki’ banana last year. “But they are offering Rs 13-16 per kg this year, despite the fact that the demand for the fruit is high. I spent nearly Rs 1.5 lakh to cultivate banana on one acre, but the unseasonal showers and the cold weather, we suffered huge losses,” Mariswamy rued.Deputy director of horticulture department in Chamarajanagar BL Shivaprasad confirmed that they had received several complaints from farmers about the losses they had incurred following the outbreak of yellow leaf spot, and other fungal diseases, which had affected their banana plantation. “Unseasonal showers in November further compounded their woes,” he said.Deputy director of horticulture BT Rudresh told TOI, “The low temperature, humid weather and heavy rainfall accelerated the development of banana crop. The climatic conditions were also perfect for the spread of fungal and leaf spot diseases.”Farms wherein proper arrangements were not made to drain excess water turned into a fertile ground for the spread of disease. Farms must be clean and free of weeds, and steps must be taken to prevent clogging, Rudresh added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/farmers-dismayed-as-price-of-banana-crashes/articleshow/88783550.cms||---
---||Mysuru||Karnataka: In 6 months, Muda recovers property worth Rs 533 crore||MYSURU: Faced with financial constraints, Mysuru Urban Development Authority is focused on mobilising resources and has zeroed in on reclaiming its prime properties even as it auctions prime plots. In six months since its drive to generate money began, it has garnered Rs 533 crore. Muda has reclaimed over 54.25 acres of prime land and 134 sites in six months which were either being encroached or illegally occupied by people from several years. The recovered properties are estimated to be worth Rs 342.9 crore. The properties are 15 acre 19 guntas in Lalithadripura, 8.27 acres in Hanchya, 8.31 acres in Hinkal, 6.14 acres in Basavanahalli, 3.27 acrea in Sagathahalli and in Devanuru and Belavatha villages. The 134 reclaimed sites which were illegally occupied by creating fake documents and constructing structures are worth around Rs 191.5 crore. The authorities claimed that illegal structures constructed in 14 sites in Devanuru, 13 sites in Hinkal, 12 sites in Vidyaranyapuram, 12 sites in Bannimantap and sites in Devanuru second stage, Paduvana Road in Kuvempunagar, TK Layout, Belavatha, Dattagalli and NR Mohalla, Gokulam were demolished, and properties were recovered. Muda chairman HV Rajeev told TOI, “We are able to recover the properties on the directions from courts. Some of the land losers had approached the court questioning the acquisition. We succeeded in submitting documents to prove the completion of acquisition,” he said. Under fire from publicMuda had come under severe criticism from public for failing to provide compensation to land losers or farmers for acquiring lands for developing layouts. As part of its programme to provide sites and houses for people at an affordable price, Muda had acquired land from farmers, but failed to provide compensation which forced the landowners to approach the court. In some cases, courts had issued orders to seize Muda’s immovable properties to recoup losses, embarrassing the authority. This delay in providing compensation to the land losers had also led to farmers opposing Muda’s plans to acquire their lands. Due to this, various projects which have been planned are still hanging fire.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/in-6-months-muda-recovers-property-worth-533-crore/articleshow/88783551.cms||Lakshmikantha BK

Everyone knows about the developments in Doklam and Galwan valley on the India-China border. The PM is silent,” he told reporters in Raipur before leaving for Bhilai.Iron nails, barbed wires and barricades were used to ensure that farmers did not reach Delhi, the CM said, adding: “In a country of farmers, the PM fears threat from the farmers. Unemployment and inflation are rising. All this indicates the country is not in safe hands.”Baghel said that BJP’s organising Mahamrityunjaya Yajna for Modi and burning of the effigy of Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Chenni is just political propaganda to “make a mountain out of a molehill”. “In the past Congress did not politicise such incidents, like when black flags were shown to then Prime minister Dr Manmohan Singh,” he remarked.Baghel, who is the senior Congress observer for the upcoming assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, said BJP has no roots or support base in Punjab. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi backed out (of the event) after poor attendance at the public meeting. BJP is trying to derive political mileage through propaganda,” he said.Referring to the just-concluded civic polls in Chhattisgarh, the chief minister said it’s for the first time in state’s history that all 14 municipal corporations are headed by mayors belonging to a single party. “This victory indicates that Congress has gained strength in the urban areas also,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/pm-modi-sees-threat-from-farmers-but-silent-on-china-says-baghel/articleshow/88783552.cms||---

---||Raipur||IGKV develops new variety of tasty & healthy minor fruit||Raipur: Indira Gandhi Krishi Vishwavidyalaya (IGKV) has developed the very first variety of a minor fruit ‘CG Capegooesberry-1’ in Chhattisgarh. IGKV Principal Investigator Dr Ghanshyam Das Sahu told TOI “A sour-sweet and highly popular Capegooseberry-1, whose botanical name is ‘Physalis peruviana L.’ has developed its first ever variety as “CG Capegooseberry-1”.  Tasty and healthy, the fruit weighs up to 25 grams and has medicinal properties with a good source of vitamin- A & vitamin- C, contains 40% of proteins, 15% of calcium and 10% of vitamin- C, fiber, carbohydrates and has a sour-sweet and juicy taste. This can be used for making jams and sauce.IGKV’s department of fruit science developed the ‘CG Capegooseberry-1’ by using the strain IGCG (selection 3) of Capgooseberry (Rasbhari). A team of agricultural scientists Dr. G D Sahu, Dr Prabhakar Singh, Dr Purnendra Kumar Sahu, Dr Sarita Sahu, Vikas Ramteke, Dr Vijay Kumar were associated with the project.The scientists have developed this variety by researching 27 varieties for six years. The fruit is rich in its size and quality. Due to its large size, it can be used in salads, jams, juices and can be eaten raw. Dr Sahu said the fruit is considered as beneficial for the kidney. The fruits, flowers, leaves, stems and roots of raspberry are beneficial in stomach diseases. The decoction of the leaves strengthens the digestive system, increases appetite and reduces inflammation in the body. The cultivation of Rasbhari, which is sold in the market for Rs 200 to 400 a kg, is possible in hilly, plains and plateau areas. According to Dr Ghanshyam Sahu, 200 to 250 grams of the seed is sufficient for sowing on one hectare field, which is economically viable for farmers.

The family, which came to the city for the darshan of Goddess Sri Kanaka Durga atop Indrakeeladri, had stayed at a choultry on the foothill of the Indrakeeladri ghat. They were found dead on Saturday morning. While two of the family members ended their lives by jumping into the river Krishna, two others had consumed either pesticide or an overdose of medicines. The police said the family had entered into the suicide pact due to financial problems, resulting from loss of business. The family is an ardent devotee of Goddess Kanaka Durga and would quite often visit the temple in Vijayawada for the darshan. The police said the members may have preferred Vijayawada for the suicide pact as they wanted to end their lives in the presence of the presiding deity of the city. One Town police inspector Venkateswarulu said the head of the family, Papulla Suresh (59), was running a medical stores and a petrol bunk on a lease basis at Nizamabad town along with his sons, Pappula Asish (22) and Pappula Akhil (28). The family suffered losses in the business after the medical shop was demolished as a part of road widening. The petrol bunk became defunct last year and the ancestral property of the family was auctioned by bankers recently as they failed to repay the bank loan. Suresh,who is a devotee of Goddess Kanaka Durga had decided to end his life after offering prayers in Vijayawada. He came to Vijayawada on Friday along with his wife Sri Latha (54) and two sons.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/business-failure-drives-family-of-4-to-die-by-suicide-in-vij/articleshow/88783558.cms||Venu Lanka
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Maternity leave granted to commissioning mother by HC||VIJAYAWADA: The high court has said a commissioning mother is eligible for maternity leave to take care of the child. A commissioning mother is one who hires a surrogate mother to bear child on her behalf.  The court passed the order after hearing a writ petition filed by Dr B V V Kiranmai, who works as an associate professor at Rangaraya medical college in Kakinada.  She had sought maternity leave for taking care of twins born through surrogacy. The high court bench of Justice Ninala Jayasurya passed the interim orders, directing the government to grant maternity leave to Dr Kiranmai to take care of her newborns. Kiranmayi, in her petition, stated she was denied maternity leave as she had the twins through a surrogate. KV Seshagiri, counsel for the petitioner, argued that denial of maternity leave to a commissioning mother is against fundamental rights. The government pleader requested the court to give time for filing a counter. The court did not take the argument of the government pleader into consideration, and sanctioned leave considering the matter as a special case, adding that the duration of the leave would be based on the final judgement.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/maternity-leave-granted-to-commissioning-mother-by-hc/articleshow/88783559.cms||Venu Lanka

RGV, who recently got involved in a twitter spat with Perni after objecting to government’s move to fix movie ticket prices and ban benefit shows in state, expressed confidence that the meeting would help in resolving the issue. The government, which recently introduced several measures to regulate the number of shows and check exhibitors from inflating ticket prices in theatres, is in the process of introducing online sale of tickets for theatres across all 13 districts in the state. It also brought down ticket prices and capped the number of shows per day to four. Tollywood has been divided on the issue, with one group welcoming the initiative and others opposing the move. RGV too has opposed the government’s intervention and wants the pricing of tickets to be left to the exhibitors. Perni has justified the government’s decision to regulate ticket prices, saying due to the high remuneration being charged by some actors the production cost of films goes up several times, while the high ticket prices for these movies in the theatres keep them out of the reach of the common audience. Many theatres were recently sealed for violating the rules, which led several theatres to down their shutters as a mark of protest. Representatives from the Telugu film industry led by R Narayana Murthy met the minister earlier and held talks, but could not arrive at a consensus on the issue.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/after-spat-on-twitter-rgv-gets-invite-to-meet-perni-tomorrow/articleshow/88783560.cms||Gopi Dara

Congress leaders had been expecting the announcement of political appointments this month. The party had so far announced appointment of only 10 district presidents and the remaining was to be made and consultations were on. Both Gehlot and Maken were quarantined at their residences after testing positive. State Congress president Govind Singh Dotasra has also reduced meetings with people as a precaution due to being in touch with the chief minister. Congress leaders and workers have high hopes regarding political and organization appointments this month. Dotasra had also decided to go to Delhi on January 9 to meet Maken and take forward the appointment process. Since Maken himself has been quarantined after testing positive, the meeting has been postponed. “If the consultation with the high command is not shifted online considering the present peculiar situation, the appointments are likely to be delayed,” said a leader. Many workers and leaders wanted to meet chief minister Ashok Gehlot regarding political appointments and were busy lobbying for several days. These meetings are not possible due to Gehlot being quarantined, increasing the frustration among the leaders. The Covid situation does not seem to be improving any time soon. Besides the announcement of election in the five states, the central leadership focus will now be on poll-bound states.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/wait-likely-to-get-longer-for-political-appointments-as-cm-maken-battle-covid/articleshow/88783569.cms||---

Doctors said such symptoms cannot be ignored and such patients should isolate themselves. They said they are clinically examining symptoms of patients before advising Covid-19 tests. They have also urged patients to stay at home until they test negative as the Omicron variant, which is driving the Covid-19 surge in the state is spreading fast. Many patients, who have ILI or URI symptoms, are avoiding Covid-19 tests and taking medicines over the counter, which could spread the virus as they do not isolate them. "Patients with URI symptoms, such as sore throat and cough, should get a Covid-19 test done. Currently, a high index of suspicion of Covid-19 must be there when a patient has URI. Also, those who have a history of coming in contact with a Covid-19 patient should get the test done for Covid-19 and isolate until they test negative," said Dr Ajit Singh, superintendent at RUHS hospital. Doctors said patients complaining of gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting or diarrhea should also get tested. A health department official said the asymptomatic cases or those having mild symptoms should isolate themselves from other household members, stay in the identified room and away from other people, especially the elderly and those with co-morbid conditions like hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, and renal diseases. The doctors have advised patients under home isolation to monitor their health and seek immediate medical attention if their high-grade fever remained unresolved, difficulty in breathing, dip in oxygen saturation below 93%, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, mental confusion, or inability to arouse and severe fatigue and myalgia.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/people-with-flu-like-or-breathing-issues-should-get-tested-say-experts/articleshow/88783575.cms||---

While in 2019, only one child was adopted by international citizens, in 2021, total eight children were adopted by foreigners. Officials claimed that international citizens were open to the idea of adopting special children while Indians were not. In 2019, a total of 27 children were adopted which came down to 24 in 2020. Out of which four were international adoptions, while in 2021, 20 children were adopted. Panwar Kiran, superintendent, Gandhinagar Shishu Grah, elaborating on this trend, said, “The number of international adoptions did go up in the past two years as people from abroad are keen to adopt even special children. This might be because the medical facilities abroad are possibly better and more importantly the international governments bear their medical expenses so it makes it somewhat easier.”The adoptions are processed through Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA) which is a statutory body of Ministry of Women & Child Development, Government of India. It functions as the nodal body for adoption of Indian children and is mandated to monitor and regulate in-country and inter-country adoptions. CARA is designated as the Central authority to deal with inter-country adoptions in accordance with the provisions of the Hague Convention on Inter-country Adoption, 1993, ratified by Government of India in 2003. CARA primarily deals with adoption of orphan, abandoned and surrendered children through its associated /recognised adoption agencies. Most of the adoptions were of girl children which included both domestic and international adoptions. In the latter, people from countries like Spain, Canada and others adopted children from India. Talking about adoption of special children, the official said that most of them have treatable or manageable ailments. "In the end, they love the child and decide they want him/her in their life," she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/kids-adoption-falls-to-20-in-2021-against-27-in-2019/articleshow/88783578.cms||---

The absence of any clear guidelines so far in registering the migrants and conducting RT-PCR tests except for those coming via air is making it difficult for local administrations to contain the infection. The local administration has activated its machinery to contain the situation in these districts which are the entry point for migrants in the state. Of 24 positive cases reported in Dungarpur on Friday, 17 had returned from Gujarat. Dungarpur SP Sudhir Joshi said, “We have started checking passengers at checkposts on the border. Those showing symptoms are being tested and treated accordingly.” However, they are not keeping track of migrants to places they are heading to. The guidelines did say necessary measures need to be taken to stop the spread. DM Banswara Ankit Kumar Singh has directed the local administration to adopt the measures taken during the first and second waves of Covid. Admitting that the district will witness an influx of migrants, Banswara Covid war room incharge Bhawani Singh Palawat, said, "The migrants have just started coming from the entire country. We have activated the village level committee to register and home quarantine those returning from anywhere outside the state. Even schools have been asked to serve as institutional quarantine centres". Pratapgarh district is relying on aggressive testing as they cannot check the movement of migrants coming in the district. V D Meena, CMHO, Pratapgarh, said they have increased testings from 300-400 to 1,500-1,800. “The fear of lockdown is very high among migrants which is the reason why they have started coming back in huge numbers. The only option we have is to encourage people to come for testing even if they show minor symptoms,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/migrants-return-may-spike-infections-in-tribal-districts/articleshow/88783580.cms||---

Manisha (name changed), who safely returned along with her husband to her in-laws house, was clueless that without a visa or a passport one could not cross the border. “She is an innocent woman. My team found her roaming near a gurudwara under Jallianwala Bagh police station area when they intimated me on Wednesday. I met her with some of our women policemen,” Manjit Singh, assistant commissioner of police, Amritsar (east), said on Saturday. Almost a fortnight ago, she had met the man through an online game and decided to cross the border via Atari to meet him. She reached Jallianwalah Bagh area in Amritsar when she was caught by Punjab police. “After speaking to her for almost an hour, she told us that she came in contact with a Pakistani man while playing an online game. Thereafter, they exchanged their numbers and he asked her to come to Kartarpur Sahib Gurudwara where he promised to meet her. The woman was totally clueless about the fact that Kartarpur Sahib is situated in Pakistan and one needed permission and has to undergo immigration and other formalities,” Singh added. “When we asked her address, she gave us the telephone numbers of her relatives. We informed them and Dholpur police on Thursday. Her family was assured of her safety.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Kumbhalgarh and Todgarh-Raoli face challenges in becoming tiger turfs||JAIPUR: Stiff challenges remain for Rajasthan forest department to declare Kumbhalgarh Wildlife Sanctuary (KWS) and Todgarh-Raoli Wildlife Sanctuary (TRWS) as potential tiger reserves as the assessment report of the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) committee on feasibility has observed that the territory is unsuitable for holding a viable tiger population. The report highlighted that the length of the proposed tiger reserve is about 200-220-km, but its width varies between 3 to 15-km making it difficult to confine tigers and other wildlife and may escalate human wildlife conflict in adjoining areas. The report recommendations read that in phase-1 (2021-2023), Rajasthan government should create an inviolate core of at least 800-1,000 sqkm (with a minimum width of 15-20 km) by involving areas from both Kumbhalgarh and Todgarh Raoli WLSs. The critical tiger habitat should consist of inviolate areas with ample prey base so that it can sustain at least 20 breeding females in the long-term. R.N. Mehrotra, IFS (retd.), a member of the committee said, “The state government has to secure a niche for tigers. If the tiger is introduced in the current scenario, there will be a conflict. It is required to develop inviolate areas with ample prey base to hold a viable tiger population. Moreover, the adjoining landscape should be consolidated and integrated with the proposed tiger reserve.” “An extent of 1,280.486 sqkm comprising both the protected areas including Kumbhalgarh and Todgarh Raoli has been proposed as the tiger reserve. The committee has recommended consolidating and merging adjoining revenue/waste land, agriculture land, territorial forest to increase the area upto 2053sqkm. For this, the state government and district administration’s involvement is required too and the process is a bit time consuming,” said a source. DFO Fateh Singh Rathore said, “The forest department has already started development of grassland work based on the recommendations. Initially, 1,280.486 sqkm area will be developed where tigers will be released.” The committee further highlighted that the existing road and rail network will be a threat to the big cat. The feasibility report reads, “The entire landscape (including the proposed tiger reserve) is interspersed with an unmitigated network of national and state highways, district roads and a MG railway track. These might pose a serious threat to establishing a tiger population.” An official source said big cats in Kumbhalgarh in phase-II (2023-2024) practically appears to be a vague dream as preparation and implementation of a tiger reintroduction plan will be adopted after a re-assessment of the preparedness after two years in close consultation with NTCA and Wildlife Institute of India (WII). “Few recommendations such as constructing underpasses, overpasses and mitigating the road and railway infrastructures within the proposed tiger landscape require time. Moreover, night closure of traffic and notifying nearby land may invite protest. The department cannot make these decisions without involvement of local administration, villagers and politicians,” said a source The committee also highlighted a shortage of staff to monitor the area. Rituraj Singh Lawyer and conservationist said, “State must fill all the posts lying vacant at Kumbhalgarh and Todgarh. There is paucity in fund allocation to the sanctuaries for forest management, maintenance and purchase of equipment, vehicles, etc. State must ensure that committee recommendations are adhered to without delay.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/kumbhalgarh-todgarh-raoli-face-challenges-in-becoming-tiger-turfs/articleshow/88783582.cms||---

Umarulla Bashith from Uppala in Kerala, apologised for the incident in a video shared on social media. Bashith’s friend, who shared the video with TOI, said that the incident of dressing up as Koragajja was not intended to hurt anyone. “During my wedding ceremony, my friends did it for fun. It was not intended to hurt the Koraga community or any other caste. I have faith and respect towards all castes. I apologise if it hurt anyone,” Bashith said in a 33-second video. Meanwhile, another video of him extending apologies has also gone viral on social media platforms. Bashith had arrived at the house of his bride, dressed up as Koragajja, while his friends danced beside him in Salethoor at Kolnad village in Bantwal on Thursday. The video of the incident went viral the next day. Based on a complaint, Vittal police registered a case under sections 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion) and 295 of the IPC (injuring or defiling place of worship with intent to insult the religion of any class). Police said the case is being investigated. VHP calls for mass prayers on TuesdayThe Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) has called upon temples, daivasthanas and bhajana mandirs in Dakshina Kannada, Udupi and Kasaragod districts to hold special prayers on Tuesday, to stop instances of desecration of Koragajja shrines, temples and daivastanas.VHP zonal secretary Sharan Pumpwell said that several instances of desecration of Hindu gods and daivas, reported in the past, have hurt the religious sentiments of Hindus. “Ridiculing Hindu Gods and daivaradhane, sharing pictures hurting religious sentiments on social media, desecrating holy Nagabanas, placing condoms in donation boxes of temples, daivastanas, bhajana mandirs and dancing dressed as Koragajja have hurt the religious sentiments of lakhs of Hindus. Hindu religious shrines in coastal districts should hold special prayers seeking divine intervention, to punish those who are behind such acts,” Sharan said. He requested the management of Hindu religious shrines, religious leaders, organisations and devotees to unite to protect religious places in their respective regions. BJP state president and Dakshina Kannada MP Nalin Kumar Kateel said the government will not tolerate the efforts of anti-national forces to disturb peace in the coastal districts. He directed the police to act tough against the accused in the Vittal incident.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/muslim-groom-apologises-to-koragajja-devotees/articleshow/88783587.cms||---
---||Mangaluru||New pest infesting areca kernel reported||Mangaluru: A team of scientists from ICAR-Central Plantation Crops Research Institute (CPCRI) Regional Station, Vittal, have identified a new pest infesting arecanut kernel on agricultural fields.During a regular pest and disease surveillance programme, an unusual infestation was observed in young gardens located at Markanja village of Sullia and Kaniyoor village of Kadaba taluks. Systematic diagnosis confirmed the attack of Xylosandrus crassiusculus, a scolytid beetle measuring 2.5-2.8 mm. The adult female beetle bores the husk by making a gallery of 1.06-2.39 mm, and enters the kernel. It feeds on the internal content, and breeds in the galleries. Infestation can be identified based on the hole made by the insect, and extrusion of frass noodles from the bored hole. The scientists also discovered the symbiotic association of a fungi—Ambrosiella roeperi—with the pest. Interestingly, this fungus serves as a nutrition rich food source for larvae and adults. The fungus will cause black staining of kernel tissues, and profuse growth of greyish fungal colony. This will reduce the weight of the nut, and affect its storage life and marketable quality. This is the first report of Xylosandrus crassiusculus, a scolytid beetle affecting arecanut kernel, and the symbiotic association of Ambrosiella roeperi, at the global level. It was reported by a team of ICAR-CPCRI, lead by Shivaji Thube, Thavaprakasa Pandian and Bhavishya. The work was published in an international journal, ‘Insects’. “Our scientists have identified and reported a new pest of arecanut, that infests the kernel. Further, its management using eco-friendly strategies will be studied” said director, CPRCRI Kasaragod, Anitha Karun.“This is an interesting discovery. At present it is not very serious. However, it affects storage life and marketable quality, which is a matter of concern. We are developing traps for its management” said Shivaji Thube.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/new-pest-infesting-areca-kernel-reported/articleshow/88783588.cms||---

The colleges under Mangalore University have decided to hold online classes on Saturdays, with the introduction of weekend curfew, said P S Yadapadithaya, vice-chancellor, Mangalore University. “A majority of colleges will switch over to online classes on weekends. The complete switch over to online classes from offline will be an easy task if the need arises, due to the surge in Covid numbers, and possible lockdown. The students and lecturers have been mentally and physically prepared to hold online classes again, if the need arises. They have experience both in offline and online classes, due to the past two waves of the pandemic,” said Yadapadithaya. National Institute of Technology Karnataka (NITK) Surathkal, which is now operating in both online and offline modes, is also ready to hold classes in online mode completely, in case the need arises. K Umamaheshwar Rao, director, NITK Surathkal, told TOI that currently first and second year BTech students attend classes online. The third year and students pursuing higher studies, including MTech and postdoctoral students, attend offline classes. “We are keeping our fingers crossed about the Covid situation. All our students, including first-year BTech students, are fully vaccinated,” said Umamaheshwar Rao. Kasturba Medical College, which is holding theory classes in the online mode, ever since the pandemic hit the country, will continue with the arrangement, said college dean B Unnikrishnan. “Only practical classes and hospital visits are offline. To avoid crowding, we have reduced the group size to a maximum of five students,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/edu-institutions-along-coast-shift-focus-to-online-classes/articleshow/88783589.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

Therefore, at least one class must be held online every day, the study recommends. A study titled ‘Covid-19 and its impact on educational environment in India,’ was published recently. It was undertaken by Niyaz Panakaje, assistant professor and research guide at a private university in Mangaluru, Habeeb Ur Rahiman, Kingdom University, Bahrain; Mustafa Raza Rabbani, department of economics and finance, College of Business Administration, University of Bahrain; Abhinandan Kulal, department of Commerce, Mangalore University and Mahammad Thauseef Pandavarakallu and Shakira Irfan, department of postgraduate studies and research in commerce, St Aloysius College, Mangaluru. Niyaz Panakaje said the study focused on determining the perception of UG, PG students towards the college education environment in Karnataka. Various components of the college education environment, such as online classes, teaching, learning, college activity, evaluation, college and administration, and teachers, were taken into consideration. The study is descriptive in nature, and data for it was collected from 347 college students, including postgraduates. Niyaz stated the overall outcome indicated that college students have a positive perception about online classes. The only problem is poor network connectivity, he stated. Niyaz, in the conclusion of the study, and its recommendation, stated that college administrations should hold classes of at least one subject in online mode, because students are adjusted to online classes.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/continue-online-learning-post-covid-study/articleshow/88783592.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

IndiGo operates three flights after 9 pm. A flight to Bengaluru is at 9.20pm, Hyderabad at 10pm and Chennai at 10.20pm. An airline executive said that they are noticing the trend of a dip in passenger load for flights scheduled after 9pm at the airport, since the past two days, especially in flights bound for Chennai and Hyderabad. “The passenger load that was about 95%, reduced to 60%. It is mainly due to the imposition of night curfew,” the executive said. The passenger load to Mumbai is recording negative growth, which could be due to the mandatory RT-PCR test. A frequent air traveller said that the travel duration is approximately one hour. “It is not feasible to travel at night, when restrictions are imposed. We may face inconvenience due to non-availability of transport facilities, and restaurants being closed.” An airline official said the reduction in passenger load is seen in flights operating in the day as well. “The passenger load has been gradually dropping, due to surging Covid-19 numbers across the country. People are avoiding travel, as they fear getting stranded,” said the official. “Movement of passengers was good in December. We hope that the aviation sector does not go through another crisis because of the third wave,” the official added. Meanwhile, SpiceJet commenced its services on the Mangaluru-Sharjah route, which will operate four times a week, on Saturday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/dip-in-domestic-passenger-load-for-night-flights-at-mia/articleshow/88783593.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

Dr B V Rajesh, reproductive child health officer, Dakshina Kannada, said that about 9% of the people between 18-44 are yet to get vaccinated against Covid-19.A 26-year-old event organiser, who was administered his first dose a week ago, said that due to the fear of rising cases, he rushed to the vaccination centre. “Non-vaccinated people are not allowed to enter malls, and travelling to other states is a challenge. I was hesitant to get myself jabbed, but finally made up my mind, and was injected the Covaxin vaccine at a public health centre in the city,” he said. Travel to Goa on a work assignment forced a 33-year-old digital marketer to have the vaccine administered. “Malls and restaurants expect customers to show vaccination certificates. If not for my Goa trip, where only fully vaccinated people are allowed entry, I would have delayed getting inoculated. I took my first dose in December last week,” she said.Among those who are still hesitant is a 29-year-old NEET-CET tutor. An underlying health issue dissuaded him from getting vaccinated. “My doctors have not been able to convince me with a satisfactory answer on taking the vaccine right now. Hence, I am waiting for the right time,” said the tutor.“A lot of youngsters aged between 18-44 are now coming to get the shots to protect against Covid-19,” said Dr B V Rajesh. Out of a target of 9,65,542, as many as 8,90,957 beneficiaries between 18 to 44 years have taken their first dose.

The MSEDCL is carrying out a disconnection drive over the unpaid dues, but it is not issuing any notice to the consumers, they said. MLA Manik Kokate said, “The MSEDCL sends notices on emails and SMSes to the rural consumers where many are unfamiliar with the practice. Why doesn’t the MSEDCL give a hard copy of the notice and wait for a mandatory 15-day period," he asked. MLA Suhas Kande demanded funds for changing distribution transformers in case the one in service fails to provide power. Summing up the discussions, Chhagan Bhujbal said that the fund allocation for transformers would be hiked to Rs 35 crore for the year 2022-23 and asked the MSEDCL officials to take measures to provide relief to farmers in case of outstanding dues. Bhujbal also said that there are some policy matters for which he would conduct a meeting with the energy minister Nitin Raut soon so that the issues related to energy bills and connections resolves soon.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/nashik-mlas-zp-officials-file-complaints-against-msedcl/articleshow/88783597.cms||---

The third wave peak is likely to have at least triple the number of active cases than during the peak of the second wave. The duration is also expected to be much shorter than the second wave. NMC’s medical superintendent Dr Bapusaheb Nagargoje said that as per the projections made by the state government, Nashik city’s daily cases during the peak period could range from 15,000 to 20,000 cases. “The peak of the third wave is likely to last for 2-3 weeks, unlike the peak of the second wave that lasted for a couple of months,” he added. According to him, during the third wave, over 90% of the patients would not require hospitalisation as they would be either asymptomatic or have mild symptoms. About 4% of the patients would need medical oxygen support and less than 2% would have to be put on ventilators,” Dr Nagargoje said. Covid cases in Nashik city are constantly on the rise since the last week of December. The active cases on January 1 were 407, which shot up to 1,969 on January 7. However, less than 100 patients are hospitalised. Dr Nagargoje said that the administration has ramped up its medical infrastructure, including availability of medical oxygen. There are over 8,000 Covid beds available in NMC managed and private hospitals in the city. This includes around 3,500 medical oxygen beds and about 1,000 ICU beds with ventilators. “We will be ramping up the bed availability if there is a need. But the state government has advised us to use the available resources judiciously,” he added. As many as 1,103 people in Nashik tested positive in the last 24 hours, including 857 in Nashik city and 201 in rural Nashik, six in Malegaon town and 39 from outside the district.

This year, we have decided unanimously to achieve balanced development of all the talukas. All the talukas that received higher allocation during the year 2021-22 will get lesser funds this year,” said Bhujbal, while briefing the media after the meeting. The decision assumes significance as Shiv Sena MLA from Nandgaon Suhas Kande had objected to the large number of works being carried out in Niphad – represented by Chhagan Bhujbal, allegedly at the cost of development of other talukas. He also had registered his complaint with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and even filed a writ with High Court seeking intervention.“I had objected to diversion of funds from other talukas to Yeola only and hence, demanded equitable disbursement of funds to all. I am happy that district guardian minister Bhujbal and Nashik collector Suraj Mandhare, both, heeded to my request,” Kande said.

On Friday afternoon, the farmer took his daughter to the forest area under the Dindori police station limits and attempted to kill her by hanging her from a tree. However, a cattle grazer passing by the area heard some noises and reached the incident spot, along with his wife. Realizing that someone was approaching, the father fled, leaving his daughter behind unconscious.The cattle grazer then rushed the girl to a government hospital in Girnare, from where she was shifted to Nashik civil hospital. SP Sachin Patil of Nashik rural police said the girl is still in a state of shock, but is recovering. Speaking to TOI, he said that the girl’s mother had left her father a few years back, after which he remarried. However, there was constant friction between the second wife and the girl. On Friday morning, the woman told her husband that either she would live in the house or his daughter. Therefore, the farmer decided to kill his daughter. He took her to the Kakad Dara forest area and started hanging her from a tree, but ran away on realizing that someone was approaching the spot.Meanwhile, in the evening, the girl’s father approached the police station stating that his daughter did not reach the school. Patil said that though the girl was in a state of shock and not speaking about her father, they contacted her school teacher and close friend who told the officials that she was being constantly harassed by her stepmother. Patil then personally questioned the girl’s father and found out that the father himself had planned to kill his daughter. The police have also recovered a part of the nylon rope from the farmer’s house, using which he was trying to hang his daughter from a tree. The police have registered an offence under sections 364 (kidnapping for murder), 307 (attempt to murder) and 201 (causing disappearance of evidence) of the IPC against the farmer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/man-detained-for-attempting-to-kill-six-year-old-daughter/articleshow/88783600.cms||---

While none of the students were critical, they were all treated for asymptomatic Covid infection. But given the rate with which the infection is spreading, it would be prudent to close the schools and hence, the decision has been taken by the administration.”Nashik and Kalwan are the two tribal development project offices that are functional in the Nashik district.

The taluka currently has 73 active cases, which is the highest number of active cases among all the 15 talukas of the district. In the first two Covid waves, talukas like Niphad, Sinnar and Yeola had more active cases than Dindori.However, the health officials of Dindori taluka attributed it to the floating population in Mohadi and Khedgaon, which are industrial areas.Taluka health officer Subhash Mandge said, “The rise is only in the two industrial areas. A large number of people from Nashik city and other talukas of the district come to these two places for work daily. We are witnessing the rise only in these two places, which has placed the Dindori taluka at the top among the talukas for Covid infection.”Mandge said only five of the Covid patients have been admitted to hospitals and the rest are in home isolation. He also said that in most of the cases five to six people of a family have been infected. On the backdrop of the rise in Covid cases, plans are afoot to start two Covid care centres in the taluka.Mandge said even if cases are increasing in the taluka, the vaccination programme has been implemented in the taluka successfully and Dindori has the highest first dose vaccination rate. Apart from increasing the Covid tests and vaccination, they were also spreading awareness among people to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour (CAB), he added||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/dindori-taluka-emerges-as-covid-hotspot-in-rural-nashik/articleshow/88783602.cms||---

Medical superintendent Bhausaheb Nagargoje of the Nashik Municipal Corporation said five of the doctors and a pharmacist are from the civic managed hospitals. All 13 of them are either asymptomatic or have mild symptoms. Two other doctors and five healthcare workers are from the Regional Referral Hospital. The referral hospital gets patients suffering from heart, kidney and cancer ailments coming from all over the district and the neigbouring district as well. Dr Pralhad Ghute, medical superintendent of the Regional Referral Hospital, said the staff had tested positive recently. Ghute said many times, it happens that patients suffering from a serious heart problem have to be immediately rushed to the intensive care unit (ICU) for stabilising their health or treating them. At times, such patients test positive for Covid-19. “Recently, we got four such patients of heart ailment, who were rushed to the ICU. Later, we found that they had caught Covid-19 as well,” he said. It is possible that the infection among the doctors and the other health workers could have spread through these patients. Ghute said that they were working on how the problem of such patients, who have to be immediately rushed to the ICU can be resolved. Two senior doctors of the Cantonment Board hospital in Deolali Camp were also found positive recently and senior official of the hospital said that they too were stable.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/7-more-doctors-6-healthcare-workers-test-ve-in-nashik/articleshow/88783603.cms||---

On getting the news, police cordoned off the area and diverted traffic as members of the bomb disposal and anti-terrorist squads reached the area. However, investigation revealed that a fake IED resembling a time bomb, made by using water bottles had been put at the site by some unidentified miscreant, police said. Efforts have now begun to identify and nab the culprit, they added.SSP-Prayagraj Ajay Kumar confirmed the incident and said it seems to be a mischievous act by someone deliberately trying to create panic.“Everything is normal. We are now trying to identify the culprit with the help of CCTV cameras in the vicinity,” he added.According to reports, Rambabu, a rag picker spotted a circuit-like object in bottles near a RUB close to Leprosy crossing on Rewa Road in Naini on Saturday morning and informed a nearby tea seller. The tea seller in turn informed the police.Within moments, a police team reached the spot followed by senior officials including SSP Ajay Kumar, SP trans-Yamuna Saurabh Dixit and bomb disposal squad. Following the protocol, the police cordoned off the area and diverted all traffic for a while. The bomb disposal squad conducted investigation using a bomb detector. The members of the bomb disposal team also went on an alert when a timer was detected. However, when the bomb disposal team opened the packet, they found it to be a fake IED.Police said the culprit had used disposable water bottles and even installed a timer connected by inserting an electric wire in it. The bottles were pasted with red color tape giving it an overall appearance of genuine IED.It is worth mentioning that in 2016-17 also many such fake IEDs were found in different areas of the district including Meja.

The blue sky was dominated by thick cloud cover which left the city with almost no sunshine. With the maximum and minimum temperatures remaining almost the same, denizens continued to shiver throughout the day. Remarkably, although the city was free from fog but thick clouds prevented sunshine in the city leading to cold conditions. Weather experts predicted the weather conditions to remain same for the next 24 hours.The temperature remained almost the same as compared to Friday as there was the difference of just two degrees in terms of maximum temperature while the minimum remained almost the same. The maximum temperature, as recorded on Friday was 17.5 degree celsius and it increased to 19.5 degree celcius on Saturday. Likewise, the minimum temperature on Friday was 14.4 and remained the same on Saturday. The city also received 0.4 millimetre of scanty rainfall. Although, the cloud cover did give way to slight sunshine around noon but the same was for a brief spell with high dew content in the atmosphere resulting into starting of ‘galan’ (a condition wherein there is high humidity in the air adding cold wave with breeze). With the chilly conditions, the city roads witnessed thin attendance of commuters and vehicles. Most of the denizens remained indoors in the wake of ongoing ‘galan’. Even the local parks saw very less attendance of youngsters and kids who too remained cautious against the conditions. Different crossings of the city witnessed locals encircling the bonfire while many others opted for hot tea from the road side vendors. People were seen chatting on the main crossings of various localities around the bonfire to escape the chill. Meanwhile, weather experts predicted no respite from the prevailing conditions. The winds, coming from Himalayan foothills are too strong and couple of days without fog would soon be replaced with bright sunshine only to invite chilly conditions by the next week, said Prof AR Siddiqui head of the department of Geography, Allahabad University.The conditions are favourable for Rabi crops and things would not improve till the time the city receives rains, added the expert.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/cold-wave-alert-chilly-conditions-to-prevail/articleshow/88783607.cms||---

The district has seen a rise in the number of fresh Covid-19 cases over the past six days, with the positivity rate surging past 1% on Saturday. On Friday, as many as 66 people tested positive for the novel coronavirus in Dharwad, pushing the district’s tally of active cases to 204. To prevent a situation wherein the healthcare infrastructure is overwhelmed, the district administration has issued instructions to restart operations at Covid Care Centres (CCCs), which had been closed following the decline in the number of fresh cases. On Saturday, officials visited the Sangolli Rayanna Ngar CCC, which was stocked with beds and other necessary facilities so as to be able to admit patients. Meanwhile, nodal officers have also been appointed to monitor arrangements at private and government hospitals. Assistant commissioner B Gopalkrishna, also one of the nodal officers, said that, the district administration had set up three CCCs in the twin cities. “We had shut them down when the Covid curve flattened. We have reopened the centre in Sangolli Rayanna Nagar, where more than 200 patients can receive treatment. We will reopen the remaining two centres in the event of a surge in cases,” Gopalkrishna told TOI. He added that the district administration would set up a helpline to help people reserve beds. “We have also taken steps to ensure that we do not face the same problems we did last year. Our team of officials will pay regular visits to centres and hospitals, and ensure patients are provided the best care,” Gopalkrishna added. The DC has ordered empanelled private hospitals reserve 50% beds for Covid-19 patients from Monday, Gopalkrishna said. “We have identified 20 hospitals in Hubballi-Dharwad already, and might add more to this list should the need arise. Our officers have been asked to make impromptu visits to these hospitals. Action will be initiated against the management of hospitals that refuse treatment to Covid patients. We have also decided to restart operations in the Covid War Room,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/district-administration-to-restart-operations-at-covid-care-centres-ahead-of-third-wave/articleshow/88783610.cms||Basavaraj Kattimani

Among those who were at the side of this immortal reformer was Usman’s sister Fatima Sheikh, who was the first Muslim woman to enter the teaching profession in India – Savitribai holds the distinction of being the first woman teacher in the country. While Savitribai’s birth anniversary is celebrated on January 3, activists are urging the government to commemorate the legacy of Fatima, who is believed to have been born on January 9. Arun Joladkudligi, assistant professor at Karnataka Folklore University in Gotgodi, Haveri, told TOI, “There was much opposition to Savitribai Phule’s plans to educate girls. It was Usman Sheikh, a resident of Ganj Peth in Pune, who invited Savitribai and her husband Jyotiba Phule to start the school in his house. His younger sister Fatima, who was well educated, started teaching at the school. Her brother stood by her when Fatima was faced with resistance from leaders of her community. Fatima convinced parents in the Muslim community to send their girls to school. The bond between the two families was the symbol of unity among the Dalit and minority communities in the 19th century.” Pointing out that the government in Maharashtra had included a brief lesson on Fatima in its Bala Bharati textbook in 2014, Joladkudligi called on the Karnataka government to educate the younger generation about her legacy. K Sharifa, a Bengaluru-based poet, pointed out that letters written by Savitribai to her husband Jyotiba, were effusive in her praise of Fatima. “It is surprising that Fatima is absent on the historical map. It is 170 years since the death of the Phule couple. Fatima’s birth anniversary deserves to be celebrated as well,” Sharifa said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/academics-want-ktaka-govt-to-educate-younger-generation-about-fatima-sheikh/articleshow/88783611.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai
---||Hubballi||Belagavi police imposed curfew two hours sooner||Belagavi: In goof up, city police shut shops and business establishments two hours prior to the start of weekend curfew on Friday causing inconvenience to the general public. However around 9:30pm, city police commissioner MB Boralingaiah clarified that the curfew kick-starts at 10pm instead of the earlier announced of 8pm. But a majority of people had returned home by then. The confusion stemmed due to a factual error in the guidelines issued by the state government, which read, “movement of individuals shall remain strictly prohibited between Friday 8 pm to Monday 5 am, except for essential and emergency activities.” At a press conference in Friday afternoon, Boralingaiah said the weekend curfew will come into place from 8pm and advised people to stay indoors till Monday morning. Ramesh Patil, who runs a textile shop said due to the weekend curfew many customers had arrived for shopping in the evening. The commissioner’s announcement came as a shocker as many believed that shops can be kept open till 10pm. “At 7:45pm we had no option but to send customers back. The businessmen are upset with the blunder by the state government and police,” he said. After the announcement people were seen piling up at bars to make last hour purchases. Some bars did massive business in one hour before the start of early curfew. A street vendor at Khade Bazar said some constables asked vendors to leave the place saying curfew is in place. “We thought it was fresh rule until we learnt that it was a mistake,” he said. Boralingaiah told TOI, “As the guidelines had mentioned a different time for weekend curfew, we had to implement it. However, later we got to know that it was a typographical error. Later a small clarification was also issued.”Team sent to Sainik SchoolDistrict health officer (DHO) Shashikanth Muniyal has sent a team of health officials to Sainik School in Kittur after some students reportedly complained of fever on Saturday. The students are likely to undergo test to rule out the possibility of Covid-19. A sense of panic has gripped the residential school. A few students of Kittur Rani Chennamma Girl’ Residential School run by a private trust complained that they were feeling feverish following which the health department was informed. A school official said, “Some students have fever, but we are suspecting it to be normal viral fever.” However, sources say the students have been complaining about fever from last four days and officials visited the school only on Saturday. The district health officer told TOI that they will assess the situation. When asked if the suspected students will undergo covid test, he said officials were in the school and they will do whatever is necessary.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/belagavi-police-imposed-curfew-two-hours-sooner/articleshow/88783612.cms||Shreyas HS
---||Hubballi||Karnataka's twin cities shut down for weekend curfew as people stay indoors||DHARWAD/ HUBBALLI/ BELAGAVI: Residents of the twin cities, and across Dharwad district, displayed their sense of civic awareness by respecting the restrictions imposed by the government to curb the spread of Covid-19, spending Saturday, which would otherwise have been marked by weekend gaiety, inside their homes. The weekend curfew came into force in the night on Friday, with law enforcement personnel being deployed on the streets to ensure compliance. The movement of only those engaged in the sale and delivery of essential commodities such as food, medicines, newspapers was allowed, while government employees, and those working in other essential professions were exempted from the curfew. Since it was the second Saturday of the month, many government offices remained closed, further reducing the proportion of people who would be required to venture outside. Furthermore, most residents of Hubballi-Dharwad had stocked up on provisions and vegetables on Friday to avoid the need to step outside throughout the weekend. Barring pharmacies, fuel stations, vegetable and fruit shops, and milk parlours, most other business establishments, including several groceries, shut shop voluntarily in the afternoon on Saturday. Subhash Road and Super Market, commercial hubs of Dharwad, wore a deserted look, which was quite uncharacteristic on a Saturday. Meanwhile, in Hubballi, while compliance to the curfew was near total, people found loitering around Durgad Bail, Janata Bazaar and other neighbouring localities were issued a warning by police, and asked to return home. Both Hubballi-Dharwad Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) and North West Karnataka Road Transport Corporation (NWKRTC) operated only half the number of buses, compared to the regular quota, while autos were plying only between bus terminals and the railway station. Police, meanwhile, ensured that people who left their homes without a valid reason did not linger long on the streets. Youngsters who chose to take a ride on two-wheelers were intercepted by patrolling vehicles, and told to return. Safety norms violated at market in BelagaviResponse to the ‘Weekend Curfew’ in Belagavi city left much to be desired, as could be evidenced at a vegetable market, where scores of shoppers were seen flocking to the stores, with scant regard for safety norms. Many were spotted without wearing masks, while many did not keep at a safe distance from each other. Although there was no congestion on the streets, many thoroughfares did witness steady traffic on Saturday. In addition to the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) buses, many autos and private vehicles were spotted on the city’s roads. But the situation was not the same across the city. Many localities across Belagavi wore a deserted look, with police ensuring utmost compliance to the restrictions. Belagavi city police commissioner MB Boralingaiah said, “We decided to be a bit lenient on Saturday, since it is important to build a good relationship with the public. The restrictions will be more strictly implemented on Sunday.” Boralingaiah said that police had booked 258 people for not wearing masks, while 39 vehicles had been seized for violation of safety norms.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/twin-cities-shut-down-for-weekend-curfew-as-people-stay-indoors/articleshow/88783613.cms||---

Savanur AC Annapurna Mudakammanavar on January 6 ordered cancellation of the earlier mutation of the property — which her sons had allegedly made illegally — and allotted their mother a share in the property under Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act-2007. Premavva Havalannavar, 76-year-old woman from Veerapur village in Hangal taluk of Haveri district, was abaondoned by her sons. After three years of the legal battle at the AC and tahsildar court, she successfully got a share in the the property — 3.32acre land and a house in the village. According to sources, Premavva had appealed to the Savanur AC to cancel the mutation as the property documents do not have her name because of the misdeeds of her sons Dhanik Kumar and Santosh. She claims to have been under the care of Idari Institution here after the death of her husband Srikant as her daughters, sons, and daughters-in-law sent her out of the house. AC Annapurna heard her case and cancelled the mutation done earlier. Hangal tahsildar Yarriswamy ordered addition of Premavva’s name in the land document and the house. “I was harassed by my sons, daughters-in-law and daughters after my husband died. They had even sent me out of the house. Later, I got care at Idari Institution. Now, I got justice from the officials in the revenue department,” Premavva said. Tahsildar Yarriswamy said the woman has a right on her husband’s property. “But in this case, her sons have illegally skipped Premavva’s name in the property documents after their father died. We have ordered in favour of the woman,” he explained. Savanur AC Annapurna Mudakammanavar said, “The Kerala high court has given a verdict in similar cases. It said the act contemplates rights of senior citizens beyond the right of maintenance. In Premavva’s case, Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act-2007 was violated. Now, we have addressed her concerns.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/two-sons-deny-care-woman-gets-property-back/articleshow/88783614.cms||Basavaraj Maralihalli

The latest incident reported on Saturday is an attack on the family of a female police officer attached to Parassala police station at Dhanuvachapuram. The incident occurred just three days after a gang of goons terrorised the families residing near CRPF camp at Mangalapuram after barging into their homes with weapons. According to police, the attack was faced by the family of Sheeja, a civil police officer attached to the Parassala station. The assailants had targeted her brother, Bijumon. CPO Sheeja and Bijumon’s wife, also named Sheeja, were beaten up when they tried to intervene to save him from the attack. Bijumon was beaten up using iron rods and boulders. It was around 10 pm on Friday, a gang of eight men barged into the residence of Bijumon. According to him, the gang was led by his neighbour Shibin. A few days ago, the same gang had committed a similar offence at another house in the locality and they suspected that Bijumon had informed the police about it. This is suspected to be the provocation for the attack. Meanwhile, the police have managed to arrest one of the assailants after he was apprehended and handed over by the local residents. The accused has been identified as Satheesan, 21, of Manchavilakom. He is reportedly a habitual offender involved in similar cases in the past too. Speaking to TOI, rural district police chief SP Divya V Gopinath said that while the incident reported at Mangalapuram was a criminal gang activity, the one at Dhanuvachapuram cannot be considered so. ‘’It is learned that the attack was spurred by personal rivalry between members of two families in the same locality,’’ the SP said. However, the police are not taking these things very seriously. Even though the special drive Operation Trojan, carried out last month to curb criminal activities concluded by December 31, the police have not let their guard down. ‘’We are maintaining the same vigil and action against habitual offenders and criminal activities are still going on,’’ the Superintendent said. Regarding the criminal activity at Mangalapuram, she said that the police have already taken measures to cancel bail of the key accused pertaining to all his previous cases and also initiated steps to invoke KAAPA laws in his name. ‘’He is an accused in a total of 13 previous cases out of which he secured bail in eight. We have filed a report before the court seeking to cancel the bail on account of violating bail bond,’’ the SP said. The unusual number of grave crimes reported in the rural district in the recent past had resulted in the police receiving criticism from all corners, including the state High Court and even cabinet ministers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/no-respite-in-violent-crimes-goons-target-cops-family/articleshow/88781870.cms||---
---||Hubballi||Operations to recommence at Covid Care Centre in Hubballi||Hubballi: The district administration in Dharwad is leaving no stone unturned to deal with the surge in Covid-19 cases. The district has seen a rise in the number of fresh Covid-19 cases over the past six days, with the positivity rate surging past 1% on Saturday. On Friday, as many as 66 people tested positive for the novel coronavirus in Dharwad, pushing the district’s tally of active cases to 204. To prevent a situation wherein the healthcare infrastructure is overwhelmed, the district administration has issued instructions to restart operations at Covid Care Centres (CCCs), which had been closed following the decline in the number of fresh cases. On Saturday, officials visited the Sangolli Rayanna Ngar CCC, which was stocked with beds and other necessary facilities so as to be able to admit patients. Meanwhile, nodal officers have also been appointed to monitor arrangements at private and government hospitals. Assistant commissioner B Gopalkrishna, also one of the nodal officers, said that, the district administration had set up three CCCs in the twin cities. “We had shut them down when the Covid curve flattened. We have reopened the centre in Sangolli Rayanna Nagar, where more than 200 patients can receive treatment. We will reopen the remaining two centres in the event of a surge in cases,” Gopalkrishna told TOI. He added that the district administration would set up a helpline to help people reserve beds. “We have also taken steps to ensure that we do not face the same problems we did last year. Our team of officials will pay regular visits to centres and hospitals, and ensure patients are provided the best care,” Gopalkrishna added. The DC has ordered empanelled private hospitals reserve 50% beds for Covid-19 patients from Monday, Gopalkrishna said. “We have identified 20 hospitals in Hubballi-Dharwad already, and might add more to this list should the need arise. Our officers have been asked to make impromptu visits to these hospitals. Action will be initiated against the management of hospitals that refuse treatment to Covid patients. We have also decided to restart operations in the Covid War Room,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/operations-to-recommence-at-covid-care-centre-in-hubballi/articleshow/88781603.cms||Basavaraj Kattimani
---||Vadodara||Less use of beds, but hospitalization likely to rise rapidly||Vadodara: With Covid-19 spreading much faster in the third wave than in the previous two waves, the administration is looking to increase hospitalisation capacity at a brisk pace. The need of hospital beds eventually may not be as high as was in the case of the previous waves, but the need for these beds will arise very rapidly. Officials conducted an oxygen and ventilator audit at the two biggest Covid-19 treatment facilities — GMERS Gotri Hospital and the SSG Hospital. A similar audit is in progress for private hospitals. The Samras Hostel in M S University campus is also being readied for future needs. In-charge secretary for Vadodara district, Vinod Rao said that the spread of Covid-19 was expected to be exponentially high this time around. “It may not give us cushion to prepare for more beds. We may not need 10,000 beds like the second wave, but the need for beds will be sudden and steep,” said Rao, pointing out that the administration was preparing for the worst case scenario. The officials are also looking at means to ensure that sufficient manpower is available whenever needed, which remains a major challenge. For the Sanjeevani Seva Rath that does door-to-door treatment of Covid patients, applications of doctors have been invited. The list of these doctors will be kept handy and they will be given appointment only when the need arises. Even if hospitalisation remains low, the chances of hospitals being flooded with patients is not ruled out. To tide over this, Rao said, the system of Dhanvantari Rath and Sanjeeani Seva Rath was being strengthened. Also, the number of teams doing door-to-door survey of patients with symptoms had been increased from 74 to 750.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/less-use-of-beds-but-hospitalization-likely-to-rise-rapidly/articleshow/88782137.cms||---

A total of 14 employees who were working in the unit died. While the government has announced Rs 1 lakh interim compensation, the collector assured that the state government would provide Rs 10 lakh compensation and employment to the members of the family.Since the authorities had permitted the cracker unit to function without proper licence, they are liable to pay compensation for the death of the employees. They stated that despite submitting several representations to the authorities, no steps were taken to provide compensation so far.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/rs-3l-each-sanctioned-as-relief-to-kin-of-14-cracker-blast-victims/articleshow/88782337.cms||---

Speaking to the media after his arrival at the airport here on Saturday, the Southwest Nagpur MLA said the issue should be taken seriously. “I am sure that central investigating agencies and Maharashtra police would thoroughly investigate the matter and take care to thwart any subversive attempts by the terror organization,” Fadnavis said. One of the four JeM terrorists arrested in Srinagar admitted to visiting the city last month for doing recce of the saffron organization headquartered in the city. He had also visited other sensitive and religious places for the same purpose. On the death threats to BJP leader Ashish Shelar, the former chief minister said as Shelar was always taking a stand against the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government and exposing their corruption, he was targeted. “The police should take the matter seriously and investigate so that the culprits are brought to book,” Fadnavis said. After receiving the threats, Shelar had rushed a letter to Mumbai police commissioner Hemant Nagarale, complaining that they came from two different phone numbers. Addressing NCP’s comments on his wife Amruta, the MLA said not just political parties but everyone should follow restraint while commenting on women.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/rss-office-recce-by-jaish-terrorists-worrying-fadnavis/articleshow/88782339.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The court had earlier an order directing the authorities to commence the works of reconstruction of 25 houses before December 31, 2021.However, the Madurai district collector had filed an affidavit seeking modification of the earlier order. In the affidavit, the collector said that a beneficiary who once benefited under a particular scheme cannot avail of the same benefit again. Although the petitioners herein have stated that their houses are in a dilapidated condition, there is no scheme or fund allotment available at present to commence reconstruction activities.A division bench of justices Pushpa Sathyanarayana and P Velmurugan said that this court had passed several earlier directions with regard to the reconstruction of houses.

---||---||Uttar Pradesh election: How a saffron surge also pushed victory margins||LUCKNOW: A ‘chemistry’ that is capable of producing a strong polarization either around anti-incumbency or Hindutva, with a dash of caste 'arithmetic’, would be the decisive in UP polls, reveals an analysis of voting pattern in the past few elections in the state. Between 1989-2012, any political party getting about 30-33% of the total votes polled used to sweep elections in the state in a typical four-cornered contest. A shift of 3-5% votes due to various caste-based permutations and combinations as well as anti-incumbency from the ruling party to main challenger used to be enough for big gains in terms of seats required to tilt the balance. In 2007, the BSP won just over 30% of the votes, SP about 26%. Five years later, the SP’s vote share increased by three percentage points, which led to a rise in tally of seats from 97 to 224.The BSP's vote share in 2012 was four-and-a-half percentage points lower than in 2007, but it's seats crashed from 206 to 80. Congress got just 11.65% votes (28 seats) in 2012 and 6.25% votes (7 seats) in 2017. However, the Modi wave in 2014 Lok Sabha polls changed all the poll arithmetic. Since then, three elections – two Lok Sabha and an assembly – witnessed BJP’s vote share catapulting to almost double of main opposition parties. In the upcoming assembly polls, any political party who wishes to upset the ruling BJP will have to dig out at least 10% of the vote base of the saffron outfit. Sample this: BJP won 47 seats in 2012 assembly polls with 15% votes. Five years later, it polled nearly 40% votes to bag a whopping 312 seats. Its allies won 19 seats and acted as a force multiplier. Hence, a loss of 10% votes can bring BJP’s tally below 200 in the coming elections, provided this loss is gain to a party which also manages to chisel out some votes from other opposition parties. In a role reversal, the SP, which had won 2012 assembly elections bagging 226 seats with about 30% vote share, came down to 47 seats with around 22% vote share. However, the party's vote share in the 305 seats it contested was 28.3%, just 1% less than in 2012. It had left about 100 seats for its ally Congress. This means that SP has been able to hold on to its vote base, but BJP’s gains were huge. BJP’s vote percentage went further up to nearly 50% in 2019 Lok Sabha polls SP’s share came down to 18%. However, state elections are different. Besides, issues in state and national elections also differ. That’s why any predictions in UP elections is an exercise fraught with risk. However, a look at the winning margins in the 403 seats over the years gives an idea about the change in dynamics. An assembly seat on an average has about 3-4 lakh voters. A winning margin of 10-20,000 votes (about 3-5%) in a constituency is considered small. The runner-up can hope of catching up or beating the winner in the next election with a slight increase in the vote share. In 2007 assembly polls, the fate of 292 seats was decided with victory margin between upto 20,000 votes and in 2012, the same happened in 362 constituencies. However, in 2017, only 158 seats witnessed winning margins upto 20,000 votes. In contrast, the victory difference in 176 seats was between 20-50,000 votes, which comes to be roughly 7-16% of the total votes in a constituency Hence, a shift of at least 10% votes from the winning side to the challenger party will be required to substantially change the outcome of the elections in comparison to 2017. In the multi-cornered contests, alliances with minor players can act as a force multiplier for parties. This explains why various parties are wooing smaller sub-castes over and above their own caste/community vote base.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/how-a-saffron-surge-also-pushed-victory-margins/articleshow/88788890.cms||Ashish Tripathi

---||Nagpur||Nothing wrong in MLAs meeting Congress high command directly: Nana Patole||NAGPUR: State Congress president Nana Patole said he did not find anything ‘objectionable’ in reports of certain MLAs planning to meet the party high command in Delhi for being ignored by their senior colleagues who got ministerial berths. Patole denied that these MLAs met him and expressed their concern of what’s going on in the state unit. Patole said, “Even if some party members wish to meet Delhi high command, I don’t feel there is anything wrong with that. Everybody has a right to meet party leaders.” The recent debacle of Congress in Nagpur’s MLC polls (local body constituency) has led to an increase in friction between some senior leaders. But the Sakoli MLA played down the issue. “No delegation ever came to me and discussed such things. I don’t think there is any resentment within the party,” said Patole. Reacting to statements of some politicians who claim the security lapse in PM Narendra Modi’s entourage’s travel route in Punjab was actually a ‘conspiracy’, Patole said it has to be looked into its entirety. “The safety of the Prime Minister of India is a major concern for all. We in Congress are well aware of this, having lost two PMs. The travel and route information provided by PM Modi’s security team was changed at the last minute. Also, the scenes of BJP workers holding their party’s flags and coming so close to the PM is a major security concern and everyone is taking it seriously,” said Patole. Regarding the terror threat to RSS headquarters in Nagpur, Patole said the state police were very efficient and will be successful in thwarting any such plans by terrorists. As elections were announced for multiple states, Patole expressed confidence that the Congress will fare well. “Our party is ready and in full preparation. Our leader Priyanka Gandhi has been working on the field there. If you look at the BJP, one thing becomes clear that they change their tone. When out of power, they tell people ‘we will save you’, and now they are saying ‘save us please’,” said Patole.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/nothing-wrong-in-mlas-meeting-cong-high-command-directly-patole/articleshow/88782349.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Goa||Win gives FC Goa much-needed confidence: Pereira||Panaji: So far, this has been a poor season by FC Goa’s standards in the Indian Super League (ISL). They lost three games in a row at the start, saw their coach Juan Ferrando leave the club midway into the season and then remained winless in four matches. Despite the travails, Goa are still in the mix and kept their hopes intact for the second half of the league with a crucial 1-0 win against Chennaiyin FC on Saturday. “This was one of our better displays and this win gives us some much-needed confidence going into the second half of the season,” coach Derrick Pereira said after the match at the GMC Athletic Stadium in Bambolim. Things looked to have improved under Pereira, who had to wait for four games to taste his first victory, after two draws and a defeat since taking charge. Goa are placed eighth with 12 points from 10 games, but only four points separate them from Jamshedpur FC who are occupying the last playoff spot at the moment. Since the former Indian defender took charge, Goa have been much more organised in defence, although there is a lot of work to be done going forward. Goalkeeper Naveen Kumar started ahead of regular Dheeraj Singh and managed to earn the first clean sheet for the Goans. Much credit also goes to debutant Anwar Ali in his Man-of-the-Match performance. “I’m happy to get my first win, but I’m happier with the effort that the guys have put in the game. Everyone knew their role and played their part,” said Pereira. Pereira has not got enough time to prepare as matches come thick and fast. A Covid-19 scare further restricted Goa’s training sessions to just once in five days, before Saturday’s encounter. However, it was Goa’s grit and determination that saw them dominate their opponents. “This was a win that we can be proud of,” said Pereira. Goa will want to show the same desire in the second phase as they take on Khalid Jamil’s NorthEast United FC, winless in three games, on Friday. Pereira and Jamil are the only two Indian head coaches in the league and it will be interesting to see who emerges on top.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/win-gives-fc-goa-much-needed-confidence-pereira/articleshow/88796732.cms||---

Senate on Saturday authorised Panjab University (PU) vice-chancellor Prof. Raj Kumar to constitute various committees under the purview of senate and finalise the dates for the election of the syndicate. While the senate authorised VC to fix the dates for the allotment of Faculties, election of members of syndicate, aided members and deans, it raised several eyebrows. Som Prakash, the Union minister of state for commerce and industry, who is the nominated member of PU, called out the members for not introducing everyone as it was the first meeting of the newly formed senate and opposed the way the how the resolution were being passed without the consent of all the senators. He said, “We should treat the university as university and take all the members along and a chance should be given to everyone for representation.’’ He asked the VC to take everyone along and made it clear that he is not against the resolution, but the way of passing the resolution. He also said we live in a democratic system and a sequence should have been followed. 11 agendas were tabled for the consideration in which PU senate decided to defer one agenda item regarding the amendment in Regulation 3 of the PU Calendar Vol. 1 2007.

The outcome of the mayoral poll is not only a major blow for AAP’s municipal councillors, but for the entire leadership of the AAP party, including AAP’s national convenor and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who made repeated visits to Chandigarh for the election. The experienced Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), with merely 12 elected votes initially, managed to clinch all three seats by adopting every mean, giving biggest jolt to the first timer AAP, which blamed the BJP and officers of the Chandigarh administration behind the victory of the saffron party through wrongful means. This has happened for the first time after the nominated councillors` voting right was ended that a single largest party could not clinch even a singe seat in the mayoral election of the Chandigarh MC. Though BJP had the single vote of the city MP, Congress councillor Harpreet Kaur Babla, who hifted her loyalty to BJP from Congress, played the most crucial role leveling the ground with the AAP. The AAP, which had full faith in winning mayor, senior deputy mayor and deputy mayor posts, did everything possible to ensure win. Even during the polling, both BJP and AAP councillors were seen reading the clauses of the act to ensure things are running in the right way. Now, it will be crucial to see the role and involvement of the AAP municipal councillors in the MC, mainly in the proceedings of the monthly general house meetings. A senior leader of the AAP said, “We will not let the BJP to run the things according to their wishes. All AAP councillors are together and will corner the BJP at every issue, where they will try to show their dominance.” ‘People will not forget this’AAP senior leader Chandermukhi Sharma said, “Besides the officers of the Chandigarh, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar played the role to ensure all three seats mayoral poll to BJP. Since DC is from Haryana, Khattar joined Harpreet Kaur Babla to bring victory to BJP, the connection is clearly visible. The people of the Chandigarh voted for Aam Aadmi Party, but BJP grabbed all these three seats of mayor, senior deputy mayor and deputy mayor through wrong means and people of the city will not forget this.” Protest outside MC officeAAP supporters held a protest outside the MC office after the result of the mayor’s post was out. They raised slogans against BJP. Many supporters even tried to enter the building but were stopped by cops.

But for online classes the entire staff of the school, including teachers, are asked to come to school from Monday to Saturday, much to the consternation of the teachers. According to teachers said when all government offices, except essential services or departments, will work with 50% strength, it is not fair that the entire staff be called in schools. Teachers said, “We have done online teaching from home before, so we can do it now too. Therefore, the education department should call 50% of the staff in rotation, this will keep everyone safe.” According to them, in the circular issued by the DEO on Friday, it was written that all the schools will remain closed till further orders but classes will have to be continued through online teaching. Nowhere in it there was any mention calling teaching and non-teaching staff to schools, they said, adding that on Saturday, in a flash message by the DEO, it was said all the teaching and non-teaching staff will have to come to the school from January 10 between 8.15am and 2.15pm till further orders of the department. Director of school education, Palika Arora confirmed that teachers will have to come to school and take online classes. According to the orders issued by the advisor on January 6, schools, colleges, universities and coaching centres will remain closed till further orders but the academic schedule will have to be maintained through online teaching. Whereas medical and nursing colleges can function in offline mode. Apart from this, all government offices other than essential services or departments will work with 50% staff of actual strength and the rest will work from home. Meanwhile, UT Cadre Educational Employees Union Education Department president Swaran Singh Kamboj has requested the senior officers of the UT that only 50% staff should be called in all government schools in view of the increasing cases. “Teachers will continue to do the work of teaching children online. To call all the teachers together is to invite pandemic,” he added. He further said 264 doctors and nurses of PGI have also tested positive and the pace of infection is increasing rapidly in Chandigarh.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/edu-dept-orders-upsetting-teachers/articleshow/88783624.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Black sheep in AAP proves handy for BJP in Chandigarh||CHANDIGARH: Although AAP tried its best to keep its councillors together, the result of the senior deputy mayor post on Saturday proved the debutant failed. One vote of AAP went in favour of BJP candidate Dalip Sharma, enough to ensure his victory. A total of 28 votes were polled for the seat. BJP got all its 14 votes, including one of the local MP. And, one extra one. AAP managed 13 of its 14 votes for its candidate Prem Lata. The result showed BJP somehow managed to break the unity of AAP, which it was boasting since winning 14 seats in the MC elections. All this happened despite AAP’s national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal during his victory march visit to Chandigarh administering an oath to the 14 elected councillors. In a single page oath, all AAP councillors read, “I swear I will serve the city with my full capacity. The faith Chandigarh people have shown in me will not be broken. I will work with honesty. I will not accept bribes. I will never do wrong work and neither let anybody do wrong work. AAP is like my mother and Chandigarh my family. The faith Chandigarh people have showed by voting for me will not be broken. I will not leave AAP and will not be traitor and if I do so, then never vote me again.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/black-sheep-in-aap-proves-handy-for-bjp/articleshow/88783630.cms||Deepak Yadav

Deputy conservator of forest, Gir east, Anshuman Sharma captured the prized scene in a 40 seconds video when he was out on a tour of the sanctuary early on Friday morning in eastern Gir division.Sharma saw two male lions — one young and another matured — engaged in a matter of ‘controlled’ but heated proprietorial discussion when the older animal of around 12 years of age was clearly marking his territory to let the younger challenger, about 7-years-old, understand who’s the boss in that area. This ‘home boundary’ depends on abundance of prey, pride size, availability of watering holes and suitable habitation spaces for the lions to claim it to be their territory, till almost as long as they live generally. Average lifespan of a lion is around 16 years. However, the ‘monarchy’, interestingly, needs to re-established time and again with elaborate marking rituals mainly through olfactory signals, including rubbing their body against trees to leave their scent on the bark or even spraying urine on tufts of grass or shrubs as a warning message to younger challengers. Sharma observed these lions for at least an hour and recorded some of their movements on his mobile phone which he later shared on Twitter, sending wildlife lovers to a rapturous outburst on social media. Talking to TOI, Sharma said, “The older lion was marking its territory, while the younger one was trying to override his markings with his own scent. That led to some ‘heated exchanges’ while the body languages of both the wild cats showed that they are clearly not from the same pride.” However, despite all the sound and fury, the older cat seemed reticent of starting a duel, but if the younger kept pushing his limits, it may finally end up as another territorial fight for dominance of the winner, Sharma added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/video-of-lions-marking-territorial-rights-in-gir-makes-netizens-go-wild/articleshow/88783639.cms||---

The programme ‘Patotsav’, seen as a show of strength of the Patidar community ahead of the assembly election later this year, has been suspended following rise in Covid-19 cases.The Khodaldham Trust in Kagvad near Rajkot on Saturday announced the suspension of the January 21 programme. It, however, stated that the religious functions on the anniversary day will be held virtually. The trust had targeted a gathering of 21 lakh community members from across the country.Khodaldham is the apex religious body of the Leuva Patel community. Naresh Patel, chairman of the trust had conducted tours in various districts of Gujarat and Maharashtra over the past four years to invite community leaders personally. Patel had also made an appeal to the community members to keep their business for at least one day to take part in ‘Patotsav’. “Chief minister Bhupendra Patel was expected to attend this function, however, considering the new Covid guidelines issued on Friday it was not possible to hold the event,” Naresh Patel told media persons in Rajkot on Saturday.“Considering the new Covid guidelines it is not possible to organise the function now, but community leaders expressed strong desire to continue with this programme. So keeping their sentiments in mind, we are not cancelling the programme, but only postponing it. It will be held at a later date,” Patel said.When asked about his desire to enter mainstream politics, Naresh Patel said, “I will announce about it when the time comes. For any political announcement, Khodldham won’t be the platform.” When asked if the ‘Patotsav’ was a show of strength for the Patidars, Patel said, “ What’s wrong in it? What’s wrong if a community shows its strength before the election? It is a right of every community.”In the past, Patel had hinted at entering politics and had met some of the senior most leaders of BJP and the Congress in Khodaldham.

Due to the loss and financial crisis, the farmers stopped cultivating paddy and started cultivating other crops, including tapioca and sweet potatoes. However, the panchayat is now in the process of reviving paddy farming. As the fields are so close to the Vellayani backwaters, most of the fields were flooded and the crops were destroyed. Sadanandan C was one among the farmers who changed to other crop cultivation after going through financial loss. Now, he has decided to resume paddy cultivation in his 15 cents of land. The paddy cultivation has been re-launched as part of the panchayat’s aim to promote paddy cultivation. The Venganoor panchayat has started creating awareness among the farmers about the importance of paddy cultivation and also the fact that paddy is the only crop which suits the geography of the area. Along with promoting paddy cultivation, the panchayat aspires to achieve self-sufficiency in rice production. Sadanandan C was the first one to come forward for paddy cultivation. The cultivation has been launched in the month of December. They have used the paddy variety named ´Thavalakannan´, which they have sourced from a Thiruvananthapuram-based farmer. “I have been cultivating paddy for so many years and the continuous loss made me think about other crops. But I have understood that no other crops can be cultivated in this area due to the geographic conditions. So, I have decided to cultivate paddy whether it will be a loss or profit. But I am not ready to leave the land unproductive,” said Sadanandhan C.  “We have started convincing all the farmers of the panchayat to re-launch paddy cultivation. Due to the geographic limitations of the area, other crops will not sustain. Therefore if we are able to restore the paddy fields, that will be a great achievement. As Sadanandhan has stepped forward, we believe that other farmers will also start doing paddy cultivation once again,” said R S Sreekumar, Venganoor panchayath president.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/panchayat-on-a-mission-to-revive-paddy-farming/articleshow/88781893.cms||---

Iranian apples flooding the Indian markets are ‘disguised’ and routed via Afghanistan to avail zero duty under the South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) pact. SAFTA is an agreement between eight south Asian countries. Afghanistan and India are members of SAFTA and hence, do not impose duty on certain imports from each other. While Iran is not part of SAFTA, apples from that country reach India via Afghanistan, bypassing import duties.The result is that while a box of Kashmir apples of good quality costs Rs 1,200 in the terminal markets, its Iranian counterpart costs just Rs 700 per box. Kashmiri fruit growers have said in their communication to the Prime Minister: “We would like to bring to your kind notice that several fruit traders import and dump Iranian apples arriving via Afghanistan/Dubai in our country and this situation has put the whole of our fruit industry both in J&K (UT) and Himachal Pradesh in a very precarious situation as it has eaten away our share in the market.“This illegal and unlawful dumping of Iranian apples in our country is not only disastrous for small and marginal growers of J&K (UT)/ Himachal Pradesh but also results in huge losses to the state exchequer. We request your goods elf to impose a ban to restrict the arrival of Iranian apple via Afghanistan/Dubai in our country in order to save the Horticulture Industry of UT of J&K and Himachal Pradesh as well”.Local fruit growers say over 3 crore apple boxes are lying unsold in the Valley, 1.5 crore of these in various cold storage facilities. Since legally the Iranian apples do not qualify for zero duty under SAFTA, Kashmir fruit growers have demanded imposition of 100 per cent import duty on these.Abdul Rashid Lone, an apple orchardist in north Kashmir Kupwara district, says: “The Afghan ‘clothing’ of the Iranian apples is a crime, but more than that, it spells disaster for us. We have to spend a lot of money to afford at least five fungicide/pesticide sprays each year. Add to this the cost of manuring, aerating, watch and ward etc then our cost per box of good quality apple comes to around Rs 200 per box. Then we have to pay for transportation of the produce to the terminal markets. There is no way our quality apples can compete in the market price with the Iranian apples exempted from duty under SAFTA”. Apart from the Valley, apples are also grown in Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland. ians||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/srinagar/iranian-apple-imports-threaten-kashmirs-centuries-old-industry/articleshow/88783649.cms||---

Reacting to the development, Peoples Democratic Party president Mehbooba Mufti said it appears that Covid norms apply only to her party and not to the BJP, which held a protest in Kashmir on Friday.Executive Magistrate of Bijbehara tehsil issued directions to the station house officer of the concerned police station to register an FIR against 10 PDP leaders for violating Covid-appropriate behaviour during a rally at Sayeed's graveyard on Friday, the officials said.These leaders include Sartaj Madni, Sayeed's brother-in-law who is a former deputy speaker of the legislative assembly, and former minister Abdul Rehman Veeri, they said.Hitting out at the administration over the order, Mehbooba tweeted, “Covid 19 restrictions apply only to PDP. Not to BJP's protest in Kashmir yesterday, PMs rally in Punjab or the mass poojas attended by hundreds of people to pray for his safety. Talks volumes about J&K admin's brazen bias against my party.” Mehbooba was also part of Friday's gathering but was not named in the order of the executive magistrate.

Vaccination camps organised in Trichy city at more than 200 locations received a decent response on Saturday. Across the district, a total of 53,000 people received the jabs. In Madurai, around 67,400 people received the Covid-19 vaccine jab during the mega vaccination drive, while the figures were 62,540 on last Sunday. However, it was still less compared to the last December 26 figure of 75,628. Trichy Corporation officials said those who skipped their second dose even after completing the mandatory gap between the first and second doses were called on their registered mobile number and asked to complete the vaccination status. As a result of the follow-up, the vaccination centres recorded a good turnout, officials said. Since schools were closed, a section of children received vaccines at the camps. Separate vaccination points were established for them. Students who belong to different schools in other parts of the state were also vaccinated at the camps. In Tirunelveli, the first dose coverage for Covid-19 vaccination remains among the lowest in the state at around 78%. On Saturday, only 31,419 people took the jab in the district. Vaccination camps were organised at 540 centres across the district and mobile vaccination vans were put to use on Saturday. On the rural people’s hesitancy, Tirunelveli district collector V Vishnu said that there are instances wherein the individuals were in Tirunelveli when they took the first dose and that they have not returned to their places of work in other cities and states. “We have a database of such people and are calling them from the district control room on the need to take the booster dose,” he added. Similarly, in Kanyakumari, 32,209 beneficiaries took the vaccine, including 6,272 first doses and 25,937 second doses.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/decent-turnout-at-vax-camps-in-trichy-marginal-rise-in-madurai/articleshow/88783658.cms||---

The compensation amount would be distributed by the Virudhunagar district collector. Taking cognizance of the submissions, justice C V Karthikeyan directed the Virudhunagar district legal services authority to take steps to ensure that the compensation amount is disbursed to the family members of all the 14 victims. The court passed the order while hearing a batch of petitions filed before the HC Madurai bench by the family members seeking compensation. The petitioners stated that on March 20, 2020, a major fire accident occurred at the Rajammal Fireworks, a fireworks unit situated at Sippiparai near Sattur taluk in the district. A total of 14 employees who were working in the unit died. While the government has announced ₹1 lakh interim compensation, the collector assured that the state government would provide ₹10 lakh compensation and employment to the members of the family. Since the authorities had permitted the cracker unit to function without proper licence, they are liable to pay compensation for the death of the employees. They stated that despite submitting several representations to the authorities, no steps were taken to provide compensation so far.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/3l-each-sanctioned-as-relief-to-kin-of-14-cracker-blast-victims/articleshow/88783660.cms||---

Around 25 children took part in the survey which was aimed at sensitizing children about the struggles of elderly and also play a role in taking care of them.

The court was hearing a public interest litigation by A Alagu, a resident of Kanmaipatti village. The court had earlier an order directing the authorities to commence the works of reconstruction of 25 houses before December 31, 2021. However, the Madurai district collector had filed an affidavit seeking modification of the earlier order. In the affidavit, the collector said that a beneficiary who once benefited under a particular scheme cannot avail of the same benefit again. Although the petitioners herein have stated that their houses are in a dilapidated condition, there is no scheme or fund allotment available at present to commence reconstruction activities. A division bench of justices Pushpa Sathyanarayana and P Velmurugan said that this court had passed several earlier directions with regard to the reconstruction of houses. The judges directed the authorities to file a report on the schemes available for the renovation and reconstruction of houses and adjourned the case.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/hc-unhappy-over-inaction-on-rebuilding-25-houses/articleshow/88783666.cms||---

The district administration is making efforts to ensure that hospitals remain decongested by triaging all Covid-19 patients. As many as 314 cases were reported in Madurai on Saturday, taking the number of active cases in the district to 649. Meanwhile, the district administration has come out with an action plan based on the recommendations of a high-level committee to ensure that infected people get proper care in time. District collector Dr S Aneesh Sekhar said that a system is in place to get RT-PCR test result in 24 hours, followed by a proper triage and treatment based on their condition. “There is definitely an exponential rise in fresh Covid-19 cases. All Covid-19 cases reported so far have been sporadic and there have been no clusters as such. In rural areas, though the spread is comparatively less, there are chances of the spread increasing. A majority of the new cases reported see patients not requiring hospital admission,” said a health official. He said testing has also been increased from around 2,000 samples a day last week to more than 6,000 now. In Madurai city limits, around 3,500 samples are being tested daily. The district’s Covid-19 positivity rate was at 2.5%. According to the action plan putnin place, those who have given samples for the test should be in home under isolation till result arrives. Those testing positive should go to the triage point at The American College and Covid-19 Care Centres (CCC) while those in rural areas should reach out to the medical teams at the nearest PHC or CCC. Based on the oxygen level and co-morbidities a decision will be taken. Those with oxygen saturation below 90% and respiratory rate of more than 30 breaths a minute will be rushed to the tertiary care hospitals. Those with oxygen saturation of 90% to 93%, respiratory rate of 24 to 30 breaths per minute and have taken both doses of the vaccine and pregnant women will be admitted to CCCs or hospitals with oxygenated beds. On the other hand, people with oxygen saturation of 94% and above, respiratory rate of less than 24 breaths per minute and are asymptomatic will be subjected to home quarantine. Specials medical teams have been formed in the city and rural areas to monitor those under home quarantine for at least a week. Arrangements are in place to shift home quarantined to the hospital if they develop symptoms or difficulty in breathing. Hospitalised people will be discharged if they don’t show any signs of the infection for three days. The district administration has also advised those who tested negative in the RT-PCR test but have Covid-19 symptoms to take a CT scan or other tests to assess the impact of the virus and take appropriate treatment.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/action-plan-to-manage-covid-wave-put-in-place-in-madurai/articleshow/88783668.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

Registration of FIR under sections 302 (murder) and 201 (causing disappearance of evidence) against unknown persons followed by over 2.5 years of investigation helped them identify the dead – Rahul Singh, 26, a resident of Sambhal district and the detailed plot. The youth was allegedly killed by the brother-in-law of the woman he had an affair with. SSP, Bareilly, Rohit Singh Sajwan told TOI that the accused, Chandra Pal, was a history-sheeter. He had committed three murders, including those of his father and brother. When Chandra Pal learnt about the affair, he traced the couple, who had eloped, to a place which was 125 kilometres away from Bareilly. In the name of honour, he murdered Rahul and dumped the body along the river. He then forced the woman into living with him. Sajwan said, “We had to restart the investigation and find details of every missing person from nearby districts. It took us years to identify the body and crack the case.

I am sure, people will vote on basic issues this time and will reject the hate politics based on caste, religion,” the Delhi CM said. In a statement, senior AAP leader Manish Sisodia said that in all the five states, not only AAP but also the voters there were eagerly waiting for an opportunity to change the system. “They now have a chance to bring in the politics of work and honesty,” he said, urging residents of the five states to give a chance to Kejriwal. “They are very impressed with Kejriwal’s work and were eagerly waiting for the election dates to be announced. People will vote on issues like electricity, water, school education, health and employment,” Sisodia said in the statement. “Our workers are fully prepared in Punjab, Goa, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh. In political history, February 14 has always been a good day for the Aam Aadmi Party. So, the states that are being talked about here will bring very good results and the government will be formed in these states,” he said. “We are confident that the people of these states will trust Kejriwal’s honest politics by removing the governments which cheated and looted their money,” Sisodia said. Over only virtual rallies allowed till January 15, he said that the decision was necessary for the safety of people in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. “We are preparing for the virtual rallies. We will do door-to-door campaigning and I am sure the Election Commission will review it as soon as Covid subsides.” Sisodia also claimed that it has been proved that voting for the Congress means forming a BJP government. “The people of Punjab themselves saw how voting for the Congress in Chandigarh proved to benefit the BJP. AAP got 14 seats, BJP 12 and Congress 8. The people of Chandigarh defeated the BJP very badly, but made a mistake by voting for the Congress,” the deputy CM said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/aap-fighting-polls-to-fulfil-basic-needs-not-on-caste-or-religion/articleshow/88782740.cms||---

According to sources, the results of 24 positive samples sent to the National Centre for Disease Control from Bihar will arrive on Monday.

Referring to the importance of vaccines, Singh stated that 50% of the Covid-19 patients admitted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna (AIIMS-P) were not vaccinated. “Covid-19 can have serious consequences for those who are not vaccinated. There have been no cases of severe symptoms in vaccinated individuals to date. The hospitalisation rate in the third wave is only 0.9% as a result of the vaccines,” he explained. Singh continued, “Nearly 96% of the residents in the state have received the first dose to date, while 89% have got the second dose. From January 10, the health department is preparing to administer booster doses to healthcare workers, frontline workers, and people over the age of 60.

---||Patna||Bihar: Ordinance for direct election of mayors & deputy mayors soon||PATNA: The state government has decided to issue an ordinance next week, amending relevant sections of the Bihar Municipality Act, 2007 to facilitate direct election of mayor and deputy mayor of municipal corporations as well as heads and their deputies in other urban local bodies (ULBs), sources said. “The state cabinet approved the proposal last Wednesday and the governor has also given his consent. Accordingly, the legal cell has started the process to give shape to the ordinance in the right earnest. In all probability, the ordinance will be issued next week,” a top source in the urban development and housing department said. The ordinance is purported to amend the two Articles of the existing Act – Article 23(1) and Article 25 – and pave way to fill the posts of the heads and deputy heads of ULBs through direct election. It is also in practice in other states like Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, UP and Uttarakhand. The ULB elections will not be held on the party lines. The amendment of the two Articles will do away with the normative unethical practice of using money and other lucrative baits to pool in sufficient number of ward councillors by one or the other prospective, observers feel. Further, in the changed situation, no single ward councillor, or a group of them formed whimsically, will be able to arbitrarily remove the already elected head and deputy head of the ULB concerned. Earlier, the elected councillors of the wards of various ULBs used to select their heads and deputy heads and mayor and deputy mayor in the case of municipal corporation. Under Article 25, a group comprising one-third of the total number of councillors in a ULB used to serve a notice to arbitrarily seek removal of the head of the ULB concerned.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/ordinance-for-direct-election-of-mayors-deputy-mayors-soon/articleshow/88783678.cms||Abhay Singh

The AQI data of recent years revealed that Ludhiana reported the best AQI since September 6 in 2020 when its value was 30. The data suggested that in 2021, the AQI in Ludhiana had fallen below 40 mark twice, once in August and second time in September, but didn’t touch the current value.Air quality has been very poor thrice in 2021 — once in November and twice in December. The AQI report of Saturday suggested that Ludhiana has second low AQI among the cities in Punjab with Ropar having lowest AQI of 31.PPCB officials said improvement in air quality was because of the weather. PPCB member secretary Krunesh Garg said the improvement in air quality is due to blessings of weather gods. Many residents said the change in the air quality is visible. “As it has rained intermittently in city, the change in air quality is visible. On routine days, one could see smog in the sky. The departments concerned and people should work together for better air quality in the city so that people breathe fresh air and live a healthy life,” said Harpreet Singh, a city resident.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/air-quality-turns-best-after-showers/articleshow/88783691.cms||Shariq Majeed

It was noted by the children that 40% of the elderly surveyed feel a vacuum in their lives as they believe that they are not useful any more. More than 50% feel that the environment that they live in and their acquaintances bring hardly any happiness to them. The survey also recorded their physical well-being. The survey exercise was the first activity of the Police Children’s Club Project, developed and launched by city police commissioner Prem Anand Sinha jointly with TVS-Arogya Welfare Trust.Speaking at an event held on Thursday, ACP Suresh Kumar highlighted the responsibility of children towards elders in their neighbourhood and encouraged the club members to extend physical and moral support to help them lead a better life. “The Police Children’s Clubs in Madurai will also conduct screening camps for adolescent girls and boys, organize awareness on prevention of violence against children, mapping of garbage disposal areas in their respective localities and also develop a ‘career dream’ for individual members of the club,” he said. The six-month-old project is aimed to help club members develop a vision for their lives, introspect their talents and skills, develop personality and gain motivation to be involved in social work. On Thursday, the Karimedu Police Children’s Club organized an anaemia screening camp in which around 50 participants took part and also held a campaign on its prevention.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/40-elderly-depressed-finds-survey-by-kids-in-madurai-neighbourhood/articleshow/88782364.cms||---

The district administration is making efforts to ensure that hospitals remain decongested by triaging all Covid-19 patients. As many as 314 cases were reported in Madurai on Saturday, taking the number of active cases in the district to 649.Meanwhile, the district administration has come out with an action plan based on the recommendations of a high-level committee to ensure that infected people get proper care in time. District collector Dr S Aneesh Sekhar said that a system is in place to get RT-PCR test result in 24 hours, followed by a proper triage and treatment based on their condition. “There is definitely an exponential rise in fresh Covid-19 cases. All Covid-19 cases reported so far have been sporadic and there have been no clusters as such. In rural areas, though the spread is comparatively less, there are chances of the spread increasing. A majority of the new cases reported see patients not requiring hospital admission,” said a health official. He said testing has also been increased from around 2,000 samples a day last week to more than 6,000 now. In Madurai city limits, around 3,500 samples are being tested daily. The district’s Covid-19 positivity rate was at 2.5%.According to the action plan putnin place, those who have given samples for the test should be in home under isolation till result arrives. Those testing positive should go to the triage point at The American College and Covid-19 Care Centres (CCC) while those in rural areas should reach out to the medical teams at the nearest PHC or CCC. Based on the oxygen level and co-morbidities a decision will be taken.Those with oxygen saturation below 90% and respiratory rate of more than 30 breaths a minute will be rushed to the tertiary care hospitals. Those with oxygen saturation of 90% to 93%, respiratory rate of 24 to 30 breaths per minute and have taken both doses of the vaccine and pregnant women will be admitted to CCCs or hospitals with oxygenated beds.On the other hand, people with oxygen saturation of 94% and above, respiratory rate of less than 24 breaths per minute and are asymptomatic will be subjected to home quarantine. Specials medical teams have been formed in the city and rural areas to monitor those under home quarantine for at least a week. Arrangements are in place to shift home quarantined to the hospital if they develop symptoms or difficulty in breathing.Hospitalised people will be discharged if they don’t show any signs of the infection for three days. The district administration has also advised those who tested negative in the RT-PCR test but have Covid-19 symptoms to take a CT scan or other tests to assess the impact of the virus and take appropriate treatment.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/action-plan-to-manage-covid-wave-put-in-place-in-madurai/articleshow/88782365.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

The district administration also supported their efforts under the Jalgam Gramya project. Initially, the villagers developed small basins (khanties) and chal-khals (small ponds on hilltops) to conserve water. When their efforts yielded better-than-expected results, they went ahead with developing medium-sized ponds and even a polyhouse to facilitate irrigation. In the last seven years, 11 kutcha ponds, 43 small ponds, 2,540 small basins, 46 roof water harvesting tanks, five mass irrigation tanks, 18 LDPE (Low-Density Polyethylene) tanks, 13 botanical check dams, and 21 dry stone check dams, among others have been developed in the village. On Friday (January 7), their efforts were recognised by the central government and the Dhaspad gram panchayat was given the first prize by the union ministry of jal shakti in the water conservation category at the third National Water Awards 2020. Elated with the award, Dinesh Chandra Pandey, Dhaspad village head, told TOI, "Till 2016, lack of a water source for irrigation was a perennial issue here. However, in the last seven years, through public participation, a seemingly impossible task has been made possible. The situation has changed drastically now and we have started cultivating high-value crops along with the traditional ones." The district authorities have also heaped praises on the villagers. District magistrate Vandana Singh said, "The recognition is a testament to the tireless efforts of the villagers." Echoing a similar sentiment, Dr SK Upadhyay, deputy project director, Jalgam Gramya, said, "The villagers have set an example for other gram panchayats as well. Now, water conservation and augmentation works are being undertaken in other villages as well."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/national-water-awards-efforts-of-villagers-help-gram-panchayat-in-almora-bag-first-prize-for-water-conservation/articleshow/88780566.cms||---
---||Pune||Self-test kits’ sales soar in Maharashtra, health officials concerned over cases going unreported||PUNE: The sale of at-home Covid-19 testing kits has surged by 100% in the new year after a surge in infections, but the health department officials has raised concerns about positive cases going unreported because users do not always report the results. The manufacturers of at-home kits describe it as a highly beneficial tool in the current scenario, though. Hasmukh Rawal, founder and MD, Mylab Discovery Solutions, said, “Self-testing is a highly beneficial tool in the current situation because people can get tested quickly at a low cost and immediately isolate themselves. Our self-test kit, CoviSelf, can detect major variants of coronavirus, including Omicron. We have witnessed a huge jump in sales of our self-test kit in Mumbai and Pune because of the surge in Covid-19 cases. In the last seven days, we saw a jump of 500% and 700% in Pune and Mumbai, respectively.” A source from one of the companies having its at-home Covid test kit approved by ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research) said, “Most people using the kit are reporting the results, but adherence to reporting depends on individual to individual. Users must mandatorily report the results on the test kit app, but some may be faltering on it as there is no monitoring mechanism to make such users comply.” While taking the self-test, one has to download the manufacturing company’s app and take a picture of the result. The report is submitted to the ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research) website directly. But many users do not connect to the app because reading the test result (negative or positive) is very easy. When the ‘T’ (Test) line appears on the card, the suspected patient is considered positive for novel coronavirus. A senior district health department official said, “Many people take the test at home but do not report the results. They may, thus, miss on the standardised Covid treatment available for the infection. They may also be wrongly considered as non-Covid patients because their infection status has not been reported. To seek proper treatment, they will need to show a proof of their infection status, either by reporting their self-test result or taking a retest.” On the increase in demand for Abbott’s PanBio, another ICMR-approved self-test kit, an Abbott spokesperson said, “In Mumbai, and the rest of the country, the use of the company’s rapid antigen test has seen a significant increase in the last month.” Prasad Danve, joint secretary, Maharashtra State Chemist and Druggist Association, told TOI, “The demand for these kits has gone from 0 to 100%. Before going for an RTPCR test, people want to self-test and see if they have Covid-19. I am selling an average of 12 kits per day these days from none in the past.” Anil Belkar, the secretary of the Chemists’ Association of Pune district, said, “Sales of these self-test kits have increased in the last few days because people are avoiding to tests at centres against the backdrop of increasing Covid cases.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/self-test-kits-sales-soar-health-officials-concerned-over-cases-going-unreported/articleshow/88783693.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Pune||Omicron wave peak soon, but it may also quickly ebb: Experts||PUNE: National health experts feel that though Covid-19 cases may peak in India very soon, the current wave driven by the Omicron variant of the virus may ebb equally fast. “Global data and our own experience during the past five weeks reveal that the infection caused by Omicron is mostly either asymptomatic or mild. Few seriously ill hospitalized patients either had other co-morbidities or are over 60 years of age. The overall hospitalization rate for people affected by Omicron is 1-2%, which is much less to the rate of people requiring care in hospital during the Covid wave caused by the Delta,” Dr N K Arora, chairman of the Covid-19 working group of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization, told TOI on Saturday. “Over 80% of people in the country have been naturally infected by the virus. Over 91% adults have received at least one dose of anti-Covid vaccine, while more than 66% people aged above 18 years have received both the doses of the vaccine. Keeping all this in mind, the overall impact of the current surge of Covid cases is likely to be much less. There’s no need to panic. But we should remain vigilant and follow the Covid protocols,” he said. With the country reporting 1.41 lakh new Covid infections in the past 24 hours and the active cases hovering around 4.8 lakh, the expert said the massive surge in the cases was indicative of the third wave. “But just like the increase in cases, a fall can also be expected in the areas reporting cases driven by Omicron,” Dr Arora said. More than 50% of the fresh Omicron cases are being reported from major Indian cities. Data revealed that Maharashtra was leading the daily tally of Covid cases, closely followed by West Bengal, Delhi, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Kerala and Gujarat. Dr Arora said most of the cases were asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, just as it was observed in South Africa. He, however, emphasized that the people yet to be vaccinated should get the anti-Covid doses at the earliest and strictly follow the Covid-appropriate behaviour. Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) additional director general Dr Samiran Panda told TOI that the active Covid curve would begin to flatten within three months in the areas recently registering the surge. “For this, people have to abide by the Covid-appropriate beahviour and protocols, and act appropriately. The projection that we have generated so far through the modelling exercise shows that if Omicron is the dominant variant of the virus in an area, the surge in infections will sharply go upwards and fall in three months,” he said. “The major metropolitan areas in the counry have Omicron as the major variant of Covid. But in areas such as the northeast, it is more of the Delta variant that is causing stress on the health system. The country does not have a homogenous representation of the epidemic and states have to ready specific actions after critically analyzing their respective data,” Dr Panda said. Dr Lalit Kant, another public health expert and infectious disease epidemiologist and senior adviser at Ashoka University, told TOI, “Two things are notable about the Omicron variant. It is more infectious and transmissible than the Delta variant. Prior infection provides poor protection in Omicron cases. The number of severe Omicron cases needing hospitalization is around one-fourth of the Delta variant infections.” He said, “The focus should now be on patient care and stress should be on tele-consultation centres. Experience from other countries shows that it takes around 4-6 weeks for the Omicron cases to reach the peak, and then there is a sharp fall. Accordingly, if we witness a peak of Omicron cases in early February, the surge may be over by the middle of March.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/omicron-wave-peak-soon-but-it-may-also-quickly-ebb-experts/articleshow/88783694.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The Centre has suggested the same vaccine shot for the precaution dose.“The beneficiaries would be able to register themselves online. They can also walk in to the inoculation sites with their vaccination certificate and register themselves.

According to it, around 442 travellers could not be traced in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits, 109 in rural areas and 51 in the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) limits. Of the 7,738 travellers, a total of 7,132 were traced, the report stated. As many as 6,555 of them underwent RT-PCR test. A total of 80 samples tested positive for the contagion. The health department officials from the respective civic bodies stated that wrong address, no response to phone calls and incorrect cellphone numbers, among others, created obstacles in tracing the 602 people. Sanjeev Wavare, assistant health officer, PMC, told TOI, “Considering the huge number of international travellers, many could not be traced. We took help from police and made sure at least some of them were traced.” Wavare said amid the current rise in the Omicron cases across the state and the district, practically it made no sense to trace the travellers now. “We must focus on increasing the precautionary measures and make sure the infection spread could be contained,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/more-than-600-international-travellers-traceless-in-district/articleshow/88783698.cms||---

The second spot in the list is occupied by Thane, which has immunized over 1.43 lakh teenagers. The state has covered nearly 14.83 lakh or 24.48% of its adolescent population with the first dose of Covaxin so far, state health department data showed. Pune’s eligible population in the 15-18 age group is about 5.53 lakh., while Mumbai’s is nearly 6.12 lakh. A state health department official told TOI that Pune city is fast running out of Covaxin stocks and the drive for the 15-18 age group may stall soon till fresh stocks arrive. “The number of centres administering Covaxin to adolescents in Pune have been quite a lot since the drive began for this age group. Hence, they were able to use up a chunk of the doses,” the official said. Pune should not face an issue as four paid vaccination sites are administering Covaxin in PMC limits. Noble hospital is also expected to start vaccination of this age group from Monday, Dr Sidram K Raut, director - Noble Hospitals, Pune, told TOI. State immunisation officer Dr Sachin Desai told TOI, “ Government centres in Maharashtra began with 25 lakh doses to be administered to the 15-18 age group. Other districts still have Covaxin doses and will continue with the drive for adolescents. The doses had been supplied to each district as per their target population.” Dr Desai said since vaccination for this age group started, Maharashtra’s average vaccinations per day have risen to 9-10 lakh jabs per day. Having said that, some districts willingly procured more doses (as per population targets) of the vaccine when the drive for this age group began, and ended up with ample stock. “Districts that have ample stock are now vaccinating good numbers from among 15-18 year olds daily. Limited sessions for 15-18 age group in Mumbai has caused the city to lag in vaccination of adolescents,” a state health dept official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/pune-leads-in-teen-vax-in-state-thane-stands-2nd/articleshow/88783699.cms||Neha Madaan

The email sender demanded extortion of 11.63 crore coins of a cryptocurrency and threatened to delete the data if it wasn’t paid. According to the police, the company officials had received the mail on November 28, 2021, and the firm immediately safeguarded its data. One of the managers of the company (aged 32) approached the Airport police on Friday and lodged a complaint against the unidentified threat email sender. TOI on Saturday evening contacted a senior officer with the company but he said, “I am not authorised to speak with the media.” Senior police inspector Bharat Jadhav of the Airport police said, “The top bosses of the finance company on November 28, 2021, received the email from the same sender. We suspect a hacker could have sent the email.” Jadhav said, “We are probing into how emails of all the senior officials of the company were compromised.” “It is a case of threat and attempt to extortion. The company officials did not transfer any cryptocurrency coins to the suspect,” he said, refusing to divulge details of the email to TOI. “We received the complaint on Friday and we have decided to check from where (the server) the email was sent to the company officials. It is, however, suspected that the email has been sent after routing it from several servers,” a senior police officer said. According to the police, it is one of the rarest cases in which the hacker has demanded extortion in cryptocurrency.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/hacker-sends-threat-mail-demands-cryptocurrency-from-finance-firm/articleshow/88783701.cms||---
---||Pune||Residents rue rudderless work, bumpy rides on roads||Pune: The road-digging for laying water pipelines and the restoration work started before monsoon in 2021 and continued beyond the regular deadline of May 31 last year, drawing flak from civic activists, elected members and public.The civic authorities were criticised the most for the 24x7 water project works along Lakshmi Road, Bajirao Road, Tilak Road, Kumthekar Road, Kelkar Road and Shivaji Road. Ripping them apart, the special project work is progressing at snail’s pace. The same is the pace of vehicles on these stretches.“We always see that the project work is getting delayed unnecessarily. PMC contractors and the road department do not seem to have good coordination. If a road work is supposed to be completed in a month, it normally gets over after two months — almost double the target time,” said Sachin Mhasawade from Kasba Peth.Umesh Deshpande, a resident of Budhwar Peth, said, “Our area has narrow roads and bylanes. Continuous road-digging work is making life difficult for the residents. Taking out our vehicles on road has become a major worry for us. Even finding a place to park a bike is an uphill task now.”Aniket Mundada, residing near Shaniwarwada, said, “The infrastructure works for laying the pipeline are causing more harm than good. The lack of design, water pipeline maps and understanding of the ground situation are causing many issues while digging up roads. The existing water lines get damaged, leaving many households without water for days. The 24x7 water supply project is adding to water supply problems than solving them.”Hemant Rasane, the chairman of the standing committee of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), said the civic body had accelerated the road repairs. “A detailed plan has been made for road repairs. The deadlines set will be met. PMC will complete the works by January 20. Nearly four decades old water supply and sewage supply lines are being replaced through these works.”According to the PMC’s data, the civic body has made provision of Rs925.93 crore for road construction and maintenance in the municipal budget of 2021-2022. The sum includes Rs730.36 crore for capital expenditures and Rs195.57 crore for revenue.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/residents-rue-rudderless-work-bumpy-rides-on-roads/articleshow/88783702.cms||---

The cemetery is adjacent to St Sepulchre Cemetery on Pune-Solapur Road. Due to the corrosion over the years, and the lack of any repair work to counter the damage, the wall had completely crumbled, allowing the flow of dirt and sludge into the neighbouring residential areas.A resident said, “During the monsoon or whenever there was heavy rain, mud and slush would flood our society. Stray dogs were also a menace. We have been reaching out to civic authorities to repair the boundary wall for many months.”Recently, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) along with the local corporators rebuilt the wall and carried out other developmental work in the cemetery located on both sides of Jambhulkar Mala, on the Pune-Solapur Road.Prashant Jagtap, the Nationalist Congress Party’s (NCP) city unit president, said, “The condition of the cemetery had deteriorated rapidly over the last two-three years as no maintenance work was carried out. The premises did not have water supply or toilet facilities. There was no place for relatives to gather during the final rites and there was no shade in the prayer hall. We resolved these issues through the development work in the cemetery.”Local corporator of Wanowrie-Sopanbaug area, Ratnaprabha Jagtap, said, “There was a dire need for internal roads in the cemetery. Due to the pandemic, there was a significant increase in burials, so these issues were highlighted by the community and needed to be addressed. A shed was put on the prayer hall, toilets were built with adequate water supply, street lights were put up and beautification work was done.”Another corporator of prabhag 25, Kalinda Punde, said that it was an ordeal to get manpower to complete the development work and there was much delay. She said, “We had to bring in 20-25 different teams of workers to get the work done over the last few months. There were many challenges, including the difficulty of working with PPE kits. We could not keep the burial ground closed for renovation, so we had to pause the work whenever there was a family performing the burial.”The air pollution system has recently been made functional after being kept idle for many months after installation due to the pandemic, benches have been set up for people to rest when they visit the crematorium or perform last rites and beautification work has also been completed with a schedule for regular maintenance to be carried out. Manish Patil, committee member of the Indian Christian Cemetery, said they appreciated the development work at the cemetery. “The arrangement of machinery for laying internal pathways, provision of JCBs and heavy machinery, and essential facilities such as water supply and toilets on the premises during this difficult period through the Covid-19 pandemic was beneficial to the community.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/pmc-repairs-damaged-wall-adds-facilities-in-wanowrie-cemetery/articleshow/88783703.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

---||Pune||Indian rowing needs major overhaul: Sawarn||Pune: Sawarn Singh is not used to returning without a medal from a rowing championship.But that’s exactly what happened at the National championships here on Saturday.In fact, the 31-year-old didn’t even make the finals despite the fact that he had entered only the sprint competition (500 metres) instead of the longer 2-kilometre championships.“This is the first time I am going back empty-handed. But I am not upset as I could not practice for the tournament this time,” said Sawarn.The 2018 Asian Games gold medallist in quadruple scull is now posted with National Defence Academy since being promoted as Subedar Major.“I do the admin work and teach the cadets. At times when there are no cadets, I practice. But there is big difference between training on your own and training with the team.“The young kids have beaten me, but then they are practising hard.”Besides the gold from Indonesia four years ago, Sawarn also won the single sculls silver in the previous edition of the Asiad in Incheon, South Korea. He also has a gold, a silver and two bronze in his cupboard from the Asian Championships.“I do feel a little bit. This (defeat) will motivate me,” he said.Sawarn, who competed for Punjab this week, said he had only taken a break from rowing, and had not given up the sport.“In 2020, during the pandemic, I had a back issue. I had given in writing (to the Army) that I am taking a break. I thought I will be called back, but it didn’t happen. I have to prove myself,” he said.Looking at the current pool of rowers, Sawarn mentioned Arvind Singh, Sukhmeet Singh, Jakar Khan and Gagandeep among the talents to watch out for.“Arvind won the gold (in Asian Championships), played the Olympics. He is not only winning in lightweight (single scull), but also in open category. That shows he has got the talent,” he said.Having competed at the top level, Sawarn feels Indian rowing needs to make some fundamental changes if it aimed to reach Olympic heights. “We have a lot of good coaches. But we don’t have professional nutritionist, physio-therapists, trainers and other support staff,” he said.“What we are doing now is once a rower reaches a certain level, then we put him in-charge of diet, massage and so on. The rower is asked to do a 10-day course and we feel that is enough. But that is not enough.“We have so many coaches around the country. They talk to each other and keep improving. But that is not the case with others.“We need professional, certified support staff in each discipline. Until we do that, we will not improve.” Sawarn also believes that India should focus on lightweight events to make a mark at the Olympics.“In the open (weight category) events, we are not able to match the other top countries. So, we can look at doing well in lightweight events,” he said.The Punjab sculler also sought to temper the euphoria that at times surrounds India’s continental achievements.“China didn’t compete in Indonesia (in 2018 Asiad). And they are talking about bringing New Zealand and Australia into Asian region. If that happens we won’t win even bronze. Other countries like Indonesia have improved a lot,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/indian-rowing-needs-major-overhaul-sawarn/articleshow/88783707.cms||---

---||Surat||Gujarat: IMFL served with bottle caps in potlis!||SURAT: Region’s ever-ingenious bootleggers come up with ways to smuggle in booze that has to be seen to be believed. Latest in their repertoire is liquor filled transparent polythene pouch with the brand’s bottle cap inside it. While the easy-to-hide pouches make the smuggler’s job a tad easier, the bottle caps help buyers in identifying the brand of the alcohol. The new modus operandi came to light with the arrest of two men from Valsad city. The cops, acting on a tip-off, stopped the two sports bike-borne men opposite Jayraj Park Society. On frisking the cops found nothing and the two were also not carrying any bag or luggage. “But following suspicion the two along with their motorcycle were brought to the police station. During further search, the cops removed the fuel tank of the bike. Below it were hidden five pouches containing Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL). The pouches were hidden inside cavities of the bike,” said an officer posted at Valsad police station. Police recovered five pouches, each containing 750 ml of IMFL. In Gujarat bootleggers till now used to sell only country liquor in pouches. These pouches containing small quantities of country liquor are sold at around Rs 10. But the IMFL pouches that police seized on Saturday can be sold anywhere between Rs 500 to Rs 1,000. When cops examined the pouches, they found floating bottle caps inside the pouches. “The accused told police that bottle caps were placed inside the pouches to assure the buyers of the original product,” said V D Mori, police inspector, Valsad town police station. “Due to strict police vigil the bootleggers have started smuggling in liquor in pouches. But this is the first time that I have seen bottle caps placed inside the pouches to earn the buyers’ trust,” said Mori. Police arrested Mitesh Patel and Hitesh Patel, both residents of Chanvai village, under the Prohibition Act.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/surat/imfl-bottle-caps-come-in-pouches/articleshow/88781916.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore college teachers develop wearable ‘gait monitoring and fall prediction’ device||COIMBATORE: Faculty members of PSG College of Technology have developed a wearable gait monitoring and fall prediction device, which they have named as Gait Watch. Developed by the research team at its Centre for Assistive Technology and Rehabilitation Engineering Solutions (PSG-CARES), the device could be used to screen patients with geriatric, neurological or orthopaedic conditions for their stability problems, which if timely detected could prevent them from an imminent fall. This is designed for elderly and the people suffering from movement related disorders. L S Jayashree, professor, department of computer science and engineering, who was the principal investigator, said, “Falls are a main cause of morbidity and disability in the elderly. More than one-third of the population aged 65 years and above fall down every year and it recurs among half of them.” She said the fall was usually caused by factors like neuromuscular degenerative disorders, weakness due to aging, gait disturbances and cognitive impairments. “Gait Watch is designed to estimate the fall risk score of an individual, considering all the possible factors, including spatio-temporal gait characteristics, over a trial walk session. It then provides a combined fall risk score taking into the qualitative and quantitative fall risk factors using a fall risk assessment model,” Jayashree, who was assisted by S Swathi and P Soundaryan in the project, said. The device, she said, has to be fastened to the patients’ both knees. “Then, they have to walk for about 30 seconds in their usual pace. The details and pre-medical conditions will be captured on the Gait watch mobile app and the report will be generated.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/city-college-teachers-develop-wearable-gait-monitoring-and-fall-prediction-device/articleshow/88783724.cms||---

It is one of the three mural paintings done jointly by the city corporation and Chennai based Catalyst Street Festival with the support of Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ). One of the artists, who didn’t want to be named, said the saris made by the handloom weavers at Negamam were known for their contrasting colours, designs and durability. “The painting will surely evoke interest on the weaving community and their products among the onlookers.” The other paintings were done on a noon-meal centre at Prabhu Nagar and a corporation middle school at Ambedkar Nagar, both situated at Kavundampalayam. The paintings have evoked interest among the local residents. According to K Phanikumar, founder of Catalyst Street Festival, the mural painting on the noon-meal building depicts space, planets and astronomy. “The concept was chosen to inspire the children to aim for bigger things in life. Sky should not be a limit for their aspirations and they should think beyond it.” The painting on the compound walls of the primary school building is themed around sustainable living. “We have highlighted the importance of saving the ecosystem, tree plantation and water conservation. There is also a call to use more electric vehicles and bring down air pollution,” Phanikumar said. He said more mural paintings would come up in the city soon.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/mural-art-turns-south-taluk-office-vibrant/articleshow/88783725.cms||---

The administration, however, allowed regular rituals in the temples, churches and mosques with a limited number of priests and staff adhering to Covid protocols. “In a preventive measure to curb Covid-19 infections in the district due to gatherings in religious places, we have imposed restriction on the visit of devotees from 5 am on Sunday to 5 am on February 1 in all the religious places,” said collector Vijay Amruta Kulange. All the major religious places, including the major Shakti shrines like Maa Tara Tarini, Maa Budhi Thakurani and Sidha Bhairabi will remain closed for devotees, he said. The decision was taken after discussion with the stakeholders and observing the present trend of infections, the collector said. The Tara Tarini temple, located near Purushottampur, was opened to the devotees on December 13 last year after being closed for about nine months.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/ganjam-shuts-all-religious-places-till-feb/articleshow/88783726.cms||---

Petitioners have been asked to send photographs of the activity to the SDM. CrPC Section 151 is slapped on cases of petty fights and disturbance of peace. The accused usually gets bail readily in such cases. Speaking to TOI, the 29-year-old SDM said, "This is not a rider for getting bail but I do ask these petitioners to distribute as many masks as possible because of the rise in Covid cases. I am happy that people follow this advice. I get a lot of pictures to post on my social media account." Singh got Covid during the second wave and says he is "very cautious". He has been using his platform to persuade people to wear masks. "Covid affects one both physically and mentally. Hence, I try my best to prevent its spread. Apart from keeping a stock of masks for public distribution, I try to raise awareness about the effects of the disease during my official tours in the region. Masks are the only way to prevent the spread." One of the beneficiaries of bail who did not wish to be named said, "I distributed 50 masks in my region. It was a noble task and I readily agreed to the SDM's demand. It is for the benefit of all."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/distribute-100-masks-once-you-get-bail-sdm/articleshow/88783727.cms||Sandeep Rai

Currently, the city has 60 active micro-containment zones. The civic body brought a hostel of Xavier Institute of Management, Bhubaneswar (XIMB) under containment after 30 students tested positive for Covid. An apartment at Gadakana was also brought under containment while one apartment each in Patia and Hanspal were also declared as micro-containment zones. In south-west zone, two flats in two apartments at Kalinga Nagar near Ghatikia, Khandagiri, Pokhariput, Jagamara and Surya Nagar have been declared micro-containment zone. Micro-containment has been created as multiple cases were reported from the residential complexes and a hostel. They infected have been asked to stay in isolation. XIMB students, who have come in contact, will undergo Covid test, said BMC deputy commissioner Suvendu Sahu. The number of active cases in the city rose to 2,363 with the addition of 581 cases on Saturday. In a week, the city’s active infections rose by 1,600 taking the cumulative number of infections to 1,26,073.

Even though the Sri Jagannath Temple Administration (SJTA) had announced closure of the temple from Monday till January 31, the temple remains shut on Sundays to carry out sanitisation on its premises, effectively making Saturday the last time devotees could enter the temple this month for a darshan.To make up for that loss, a huge crowd made a beeline for the temple, putting Covid safety norms to test. The queue was over a kilometre long, stretching from Singha Dwar to Marichikote Square on Grand Road. The darshan started at 5.30 in the morning and continued till 8.30pm, before the 9pm night curfew came into effect. Normally, only those devotees who produce their final vaccination certificate or RT-PCR negative reports obtained within 96 hours of the visit, are allowed entry to the temple. But the situation turned so chaotic on Saturday that officials could not even check the vaccination or RT-PCR certificates, raising fear of a surge in cases, defeating the very purpose of keeping the temple doors closed for the public. “Today is the last day of January when we can have a darshan of the deities because the temple will be closed from Sunday. Moreover, the speed at which Covid cases are rising, you never know when the temple will reopen and when the situation will become normal. So, we decided to offer prayers to the deities,” said Satyabhama Das, a devotee, who was standing in the queue to enter the temple.“I feel very lucky that I could catch a glimpse of the deities before I return home. I was not aware of the decision that the temple will be closed from tomorrow. We have come on a trip to Odisha but are wrapping it up due to rising Covid cases,” said Sadhika Nag, a tourist from West Bengal.The district administration decided to close the temple after several servitors, their family members, and temple officials tested positive. Only servitors will be allowed to enter the temple while a token system has been introduced for mahaprasad.“It is a serious concern as cases are rising fast and people are coming in large numbers. To ensure safety of devotees, we decided to close the temple for the public till January 31. The situation is fast evolving and further decisions will be taken accordingly,” said Puri district collector Samarth Verma said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/crowd-surge-at-puri-temple-triggers-covid-spread-fear/articleshow/88783731.cms||Minati Singha
---||Bhubaneswar||Diverse treatment hope in breast cancer relapse: Study||Bhubaneswar: Research by a team at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center which includes a post-doctoral fellow from Odisha has found that when cells from the primary breast cancer sites spread to the brain, they behave differently in different patients and this can be used for diverse treatment strategies instead of the same regimen for all. The findings of the pre-clinical study in the USA have been published in the journal Cell Metabolism recently.Pravat Kumar Parida, a post-doctoral fellow in the department of pathology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, is the first author of the study led by assistant professor Srinivas Malladi. Parida said most cells from the breast cancer sites perish while disseminating to the brain. The surviving few cells may initiate metastasis (secondary cancer) which may be detected along with the primary tumour and is called synchronous metastases. After diagnosis and treatment with current therapy, some cells stay latent for months to years before triggering tumour growth very late and are called metachronous metastases. Currently, the same treatment is offered to all types of breast cancer patients with brain metastases including synchronous, latent or metachronous. The new study suggests curative treatment options for all three metastases. This study says brain metastastatic relapses are common in breast cancer patients because of surviving latent cells that takes months or years to grow. They can be treated before they relapse. The new study has uncovered metabolic dependencies of HER2 cells (proteins that helps breast cancer cells grow quickly) with diverse metastatic potential. Breast cancer cells with higher than normal levels of HER2 are called HER2-positive. Synchronous brain metastases are relatively rare in HER2-positive breast cancer patients, whereas metachronous brain metastases are common post primary diagnosis and treatment. “Current systemic therapies targeted towards HER2+ brain metastatic diseases are not curative and patients with synchronous, latent residual or metachronous brain metastases are treated with the same regimens despite differences in clinical presentation. So, understanding these differences is vital to devise effective strategies that identify and treat patients presented with synchronous or delayed metachronous brain metastases,” said Malladi. In the study done on mice, Malladi lab isolated HER2+ synchronous, latent residual and metachronous brain metastases cells. The study suggests several potential approaches to limit residual disease and outgrowth of brain metastases and may provide new direction to the treatment of brain metastases in breast cancer patients in future.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/diverse-treatment-hope-in-breast-cancer-relapse-study/articleshow/88783732.cms||---

Shopkeepers claimed that they have not yet recovered from the losses suffered during the last two lockdowns, and the fresh curbs seem to be harsher. “The last few weekends witnessed heavy rush and we did very good business. But all of a sudden Covid cases have started rising and the government imposed restrictions allowing only 50% customers of our capacity. The number of people coming to the mall has gone down to around 20-30% of the capacity compared to last week,” said Saroj Parida, manager of a branded garment store at a city mall. “With the end of season sale going on in most of the shops and outlets, the drop in footfall has led to a fall in business. With no festivals round the corner, people at this time come for shopping discounts and most shops do brisk business despite a lean season. But with Covid cases on the rise and the fresh curbs, it will lead to less business and losses. We have just started recovering some losses,” said Amarjit Mohanty, another shop owner in the city. The shop owners said they are following all Covid protocols and asking people to adhere to guidelines like wearing masks and maintaining social distance. “We are happy that the government did not announce the closure of malls at one go as it had done during the first and second waves of the pandemic but it is the shopping malls that close first and are allowed to open last unlike standalone shops. But we have to pay rents and pay the staff even if the shops remain closed and there is no business,” said Rakesh Sahu, a shop owner in a mall at Kalpana Square.

---||Goa||Goa: Two-time Calangute MLA & minster Michael Lobo to quit BJP, join Congress||PANAJI: In a big jolt to BJP, Calangute MLA and science and technology minister Michael Lobo will join Congress on Monday. “I will quit from the primary membership of BJP and also as an MLA on Monday morning and will join Congress in the evening,” Lobo told TOI on Sunday night. Lobo will be the third MLA from the minority community to resign from BJP, reducing its strength to 24 MLAs. Lobo’s move will give Congress a new lease of life in Bardez taluka, as he has influence not only in his constituency but also in the neighbouring constituencies of Saligao, Siolim and Mapusa. He has already started campaigning for wife and Parra sarpanch Delilah in Siolim constituency, while BJP has made it clear that it would be giving the ticket to former minister Dayanand Mandrekar. On Sunday, Lobo launched the campaign of Kedar Naik, Congress’s probable candidate from Saligao, which was once represented by him as a zilla panchayat member. He has also declared support to Congress’s Mapusa candidate Sudhir Kandolkar. Currently, BJP has four MLAs from Bardez taluka, but Lobo has exuded confidence that he will secure six of the seven seats in Bardez. For the past few months, Lobo has been openly criticising the Pramod Sawant-led government. Lobo’s differences with BJP started after the party clipped his wings post-zilla panchayat elections where he managed to get most of his candidates elected. With a belligerent Lobo attacking the government, BJP’s Goa in-charge Devendra Fadnavis had rushed to Lobo’s residence in September to pacify him not to quit the party. Since then, BJP has had several rounds of meeting with Lobo to convince him to stay in the party. Recently, too, Fadnavis and C T Ravi had requested Lobo to work to elect BJP candidates in the constituencies of Mapusa and Saligao. The party had even gone to the extent of organising a meeting of Lobo with Union home Minister Amit Shah in Delhi, where he was assured that he would be given bigger responsibilities in Bardez. With the exit of Lobo from BJP, political equations in Bardez are expected to change and help Congress gain a strong foothold. Bardez—comprising Tivim, Mapusa, Siolim, Calangute, Saligao, Aldona and Porvorim—is the second biggest taluka with seven assembly constituencies after Salcete, which has eight assembly constituencies. In 2012, BJP had swept Bardez winning six of the seven seats, but were able to secure only three in the 2017 elections. BJP recently inducted Rohan Khaunte, who was an independent MLA from Porvorim, and Jayesh Salgaonkar, a Goa Forward Party MLA from Saligao. Both are expected to contest the February 14 election on the BJP ticket. “The entry of Lobo may change the narrative there (in Bardez). It appears Lobo is expected to take care of that area. BJP would be on a backfoot,” political observer Cleofato Coutinho said. Coutinho said when a minister shifts to the opposition camp, it helps in creating a buzz in favour of the opposition. “It will help in boosting the sagging image (of Congress) in the area. Though it will carve out a fiefdom for Lobo and create another satrap, it will boost Congress campaign,” Countinho said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/two-time-calangute-mla-min-lobo-to-quit-bjp-join-cong-today/articleshow/88797220.cms||Murari Shetye

---||Kochi||Rijiju: Reduce gap between common man and justice||Kochi: Courts should take decisions on litigations at a faster pace in a digital age, Union law minister Kiren Rijiju said on Saturday. Addressing the 15th annual convocation of National University of Advanced Legal Studies (NUALS) at Kochi, the minister said access to justice should be made easier and that nobody should be made to struggle to get justice. “The gap between the common man and justice must be reduced,” he said while stressing the need for the government and the judiciary to work together to achieve it. The minister added that lives of judges are not easy and narrated his experience with the Chief Justice of India continuing a meeting at midnight and then sitting up to read the case of the next day. The minister further said he is aware of the challenges of lack of infrastructure in the lower judiciary and pointed out that the last Union cabinet approved Rs 9,000 crore for creating better infrastructure for the subordinate judiciary. Sixty per cent of it will be funded by the central government and 40% by the state governments, he said. Addressing a South India-level conference of central government counsels at the Kerala high court’s auditorium later, the minister said some people in the country are not even aware of the process of reaching out to the courts. “Many people, especially in rural India, have to struggle just to get a bare minimum of their entitlement,” the minister said. He has seen many who had to sell off their properties to pay court fees and to pay the fees of their advocates, the minister added while calling for concerted action to ensure access to justice and avoid delay. Talking about independence of the judiciary, the minister said, “I truly believe in the independence of the judiciary, but that does not stop us (government) from having a very cordial and seamless coordination and relationship.” The minister also said faith of the common man on judiciary must be maintained. “It is not only incumbent upon the judges but all of us to ensure that the faith of the common people upon the judiciary is maintained at any cost,” he said. Further, the minister said he has ensured that appointment of judges is being given priority. “It needs to be given a push and for that, it is not the government alone but the collegium as well as the government must work in tandem. We are doing everything possible,” the minister said. During the speech at NUALS, the minister also called for simplifying the laws so that the common man can understand them and said the government is working to repeal obsolete laws and to simplify them.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/rijiju-reduce-gap-between-common-man-and-justice/articleshow/88781967.cms||---

Across the district, a total of 53,000 people received the jabs. In Madurai, around 67,400 people received the Covid-19 vaccine jab during the mega vaccination drive, while the figures were 62,540 on last Sunday. However, it was still less compared to the last December 26 figure of 75,628.Trichy Corporation officials said those who skipped their second dose even after completing the mandatory gap between the first and second doses were called on their registered mobile number and asked to complete the vaccination status. As a result of the follow-up, the vaccination centres recorded a good turnout, officials said.Since schools were closed, a section of children received vaccines at the camps.

---||Nagpur||JeM’s PoK handlers were planning fidayeen attack on RSS||Nagpur: Rais Ahmad Shaikh, 26, Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) operative who had surveyed RSS Headquarters and Hedgewar Smruti Bhavan at Reshimbagh, was being controlled by the terror outfit’s Pakistan-Occupied-Kashmir (PoK)-based handler Umar during his three-day visit to the city. Based on Shaikh’s inputs, JeM may have planned to send him, or another module, back to Nagpur for a ‘fidayeen’ attack. Nagpur police and intelligence agencies are now tracking yet another sleeper cell in Nagpur, which was supposed to extend logistics support to Shaikh in city but pulled out of the mission at the last moment. Shaikh was supposed to meet the secret operative at Nagpur’s Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar international airport, but he did not turn up at the last moment. Shaikh had to travel around the city using Google maps. It’s learnt Shaikh, an electrician, was roped in by JeM as he had sound skills in handling electrical circuits, which are one of the main components of the IEDs. Umar, operational commander of JeM in PoK, wanted Shaikh to move as close as possible to the RSS premises, and collect images and videos about the entry and exit routes with least resistance and ease of access. He was also insisting that Shaikh, who had arrived in Nagpur on July 13 and left on July 15, get clear images and videos of Hedgewar Bhavan too. Shaikh, who was alone while in city, had checked into a lodge at Sitabuldi and visited a shrine after abandoning the mission mid-way. Shaikh, left unnerved by security deployment at both RSS and Hegdewar Bhavan, is learnt to have aborted the mission mid-way after collecting some grainy footage, which had left Umar angry. It was after Shaikh’s arrest in Kashmir that the JeM terror plot in Nagpur had been exposed. Sources from security intelligence said JeM had started conducting reccees across India for perpetrating a series of ‘fidayeen’ attacks at different vital establishments. Nagpur’s RSS is learnt to be on the hit list of ISI-backed JeM, which is learnt to be receiving support from Taliban, which wrenched power in Afghanistan in a coup. Within 24 hours of Nagpur police revelation about JeM recruit Shaikh’s visit to city, security forces in Kashmir busted yet another module of the same outfit which had recceed NIA headquarters in Delhi and other places. City police chief Amitesh Kumar said security has been overhauled at all vital and sensitive installations. “City police had been working on various terror plots and strategies since earlier this year. After a couple of developments, including busting of a conversion racket, city police had started collecting various inputs and links,” said the CP. He added use of drones in and around RSS and other installations had been prohibited after inputs of their misuse for aerial attacks had come to fore. Kumar, and Joint CP Aswati Dorje, had visited RSS headquarters this week to conduct a security audit and strengthen deployment after the JeM terror plot was exposed in December following the arrest of Shaikh with a grenade in his possession.

The health officials of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) estimate that the per day positive cases will be above 2,600 after a week if the daily growth rate of fresh Covid-19 cases continued to be 20%. The SMC officials are keeping their fingers crossed to contain the growth rate of coronavirus cases as fresh restrictions came into force from Saturday. It is believed that the restrictions may help prevent mass gatherings. “The hospitalization is less, and if this scenario continues, the situation will be normal and people will be safe. But at this rate of infection, hospitalization may increase and the situation may turn around,” cautioned a health official. “Everybody must take responsibility and behave responsibly. Self-quarantine at home is required for a few days even if a person does not have an infection,” said an official. Mansukh Nagar of Varachha zone B was declared cluster zone after eight persons tested positive there. In Rahaat Apartment of Muglisara, six persons from the same family and in Hariom Nagar of Udhna seven from a family tested positive. Both the residential societies have been declared cluster zones. On Saturday, 78 students tested positive of which eight are from Tekrawala School in Rander and six from Swaminarayan Vidhyalay in Adajan. Following a large number of students testing positive in schools and colleges, the classes in which these students were studying have been ordered to remain close for seven days. Total 876 persons who came in contact with these students have also been tested and their reports are awaited.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/surat/covid-hospitalization-low-but-cases-continue-to-surge/articleshow/88781945.cms||---

The findings of the pre-clinical study in the US have been published in the journal Cell Metabolism recently.Pravat Kumar Parida, a post-doctoral fellow in the department of pathology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, is the first author of the study led by assistant professor Srinivas Malladi. Parida said most cells from the breast cancer sites perish while disseminating to the brain. The surviving few may initiate metastases (secondary cancer) which may be detected along with the primary tumour and is called synchronous metastases. After diagnosis and treatment with current therapy, some cells stay latent for months to years before triggering tumour growth very late and are called metachronous metastases. Currently, the same treatment is offered to all types of breast cancer patients with brain metastases including synchronous, latent or metachronous. The new study suggests curative treatment options for all three metastases. This study says brain metastastatic relapses are common in breast cancer patients because of surviving latent cells that takes months or years to grow. They can be treated before they relapse. The new study has uncovered metabolic dependencies of HER2 cells (proteins that helps breast cancer cells grow quickly) with diverse metastatic potential. Breast cancer cells with higher than normal levels of HER2 are called HER2-positive.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/latent-cancer-can-be-treated-study/articleshow/88783741.cms||---

---||Bhubaneswar||Crowd surge at Puri temple triggers virus spread fear||BHUBANESWAR: It was a near stampede in front of Jagannath Temple in Puri on Saturday as thousands of devotees gathered to catch a glimpse of the sibling deities before the temple shuts its doors for the month to stem the Covid surge. Even though the Sri Jagannath Temple Administration (SJTA) had announced closure of the temple from Monday till January 31, the temple remains shut on Sundays to carry out sanitisation on its premises, effectively making Saturday the last time devotees could enter the temple this month for a darshan. To make up for that loss, a huge crowd made a beeline for the temple, putting Covid safety norms to test. The queue was over a kilometre long, stretching from Singha Dwar to Marichikote Square on Grand Road. The darshan started at 5.30 in the morning and continued till 8.30pm, before the 9pm night curfew came into effect. Normally, only those devotees who produce their final vaccination certificate or RT-PCR negative reports obtained within 96 hours of the visit, are allowed entry to the temple. But the situation turned so chaotic on Saturday that officials could not even check the vaccination or RT-PCR certificates, raising fear of a surge in cases, defeating the very purpose of keeping the temple doors closed for the public. “Today is the last day of January when we can have a darshan of the deities because the temple will be closed from Sunday. Moreover, the speed at which Covid cases are rising, you never know when the temple will reopen and when the situation will become normal. So, we decided to offer prayers to the deities,” said Satyabhama Das, a devotee, who was standing in the queue to enter the temple. “I feel very lucky that I could catch a glimpse of the deities before I return home. I was not aware of the decision that the temple will be closed from tomorrow. We have come on a trip to Odisha but are wrapping it up due to rising Covid cases,” said Sadhika Nag, a tourist from West Bengal. The district administration decided to close the temple after several servitors, their family members, and temple officials tested positive. Only servitors will be allowed to enter the temple while a token system has been introduced for mahaprasad. “It is a serious concern as cases are rising fast and people are coming in large numbers. To ensure safety of devotees, we decided to close the temple for the public till January 31. The situation is fast evolving and further decisions will be taken accordingly,” said Puri district collector Samarth Verma said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/crowd-surge-at-puri-temple-triggers-virus-spread-fear/articleshow/88783744.cms||Minati Singha

---||---||Rural Punjab key to SAD fortunes||CHANDIGARH: Out of power in Punjab for 5 years, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) has its task cut out for the state Assembly elections scheduled to be held on February 14. While a multi-cornered contest is in the offing for the first time in the state, SAD's hopes are hinged on reviving its traditional support base in rural Punjab. The party had decided to snap its 24-year-old Nauh Maas Da Rishta (relationship between nail and flesh) with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on September 26, 2020 after facing farmers’ ire on the three contentious central farm laws. Thereafter, SAD - the oldest regional party in the country - on June 12, 2021 announced an alliance with the Mayawati-led Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), hoping to influence the scheduled caste voters, accounting for over 32% of Punjab’s total vote share. The two parties had earlier been in alliance 25 years ago, when they had contested the Lok Sabha elections together in 1996 and had won 11 out of total 13 Lok Sabha seats. The ruling Congress in the state gave SAD-BSP alliance a new challenge by picking up Charanjit Singh Channi as the first scheduled caste chief minister of the state on September 19, 2021. Similarly, the decision of some farm unions under the banner of Sanyukta Samaj Morcha, led-by Balbir Singh Rajewal, to contest Punjab polls is also likely to dent the rural Jat-Sikh vote bank of the SAD at a time when its old alliance partner BJP has already deprived the party of its urban and Hindu vote bank share. Panjab University political science professor Ashutosh Kumar says, “It's SAD’s game plan to get support of SC votes from the BSP. But it is not going to help much since the Congress has already appointed Channi as CM from the community.” SAD had got 34.73% vote share in the 2012 Assembly polls and it reduced to 32.2% in 2017 polls, whereas BSP had fetched 4.30% votes in the 2012 state elections and their vote share decreased to 1.5% in the 2017 polls. SAD was reduced to 15 seats in the 2017 state polls and its then alliance partner BJP could win just three seats. In its seat sharing formula, the SAD-BSP alliance has decided that out of the total 117 constituencies, SAD will be contesting on 97 seats and the BSP on the remaining 20. SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal, who is member of the Lok Sabha from Ferozepur, will be contesting from his traditional Assembly constituency of Jalalabad, whereas BSP's Punjab unit chief Jasvir Singh Garhi has decided to contest from Phagwara reserve seat.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/punjab/news/rural-punjab-key-to-sad-fortunes/articleshow/88786976.cms||Sanjeev Verma

---||Chandigarh||Rift wide open: Congress in Punjab hopes to tide over internal strife||CHANDIGARH: Barely weeks before the assembly elections, Punjab Congress leadership’s claim of ‘all is well’ still doesn’t ring true on certain counts as the party struggles to put up a united face by tackling infighting and lack of clarity on whether it will announce its chief ministerial face. It remains to be seen if chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, PPCC president Navjot Singh Sidhu and senior leader Sunil Jakhar will be able to sink their differences to run a collective campaign. Sidhu’s move to openly support some of the ticket aspirants has resulted in heartburn among a section of the Cabinet ministers and the party rank and file continue to be anxious whether internal turmoil that began with the revolt of around 40 MLAs against former CM Amarinder Singh will finally blow over. The party is also yet to accomplish the tricky task of ticket allotment – something that both its rivals Aam Aadmi Party and Shiromani Akali Dal have almost completed. The party leaders are worried as the selection of candidates has led to widespread dissidence for the party ahead of almost every election in the past. The screening committee for Punjab polls has been able to arrive at a consensus for only 50 of the 117 Assembly constituencies for now. With the newly-forged alliance between former chief minister Amarinder Singh’s party Punjab Lok Congress and the BJP waiting to poach prominent Congress faces, the party leadership faces the challenge to accomplish its initial plan to drop a chunk of its sitting MLAs scoring low on winnability . After the party’s central leadership intervened last year, resulting in Channi replacing Amarinder in September, Congress has tried to turn a new leaf to tide over anti-incumbency as all the problematic issues have been laid at the door of Amarinder’s four-and-a-half years of rule. Channi has been in an rush to announce poll sops and welfare schemes ever since he took over. However, while he tries to showcase his ‘aam aadmi’ image, Sidhu has frequently played spoilsport by criticising his own party’s decisions. Sidhu had questioned the move to offer freebies to voters ahead of polls even as his own party, just like AAP and SAD, was doing exactly that. However, he changed tack suddenly and then announced a slew of sops for women at a rally without involving the party or the government.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/rift-wide-open-cong-hopes-to-tide-over-internal-strife/articleshow/88783748.cms||Vibhor Mohan

---||---||Eyes on BJP’s plan to play big brother with Punjab's ex-CM Amarinder Singh, Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa||CHANDIGARH: This election, BJP has decided to make the contest multi-corned by forging an alliance with former chief minister Amarinder Singh’s Punjab Lok Congress (PLC) and Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa of the Sanyukt Akali Dal. While the party is hopeful of the negative sentiment over the now repealed controversial farm laws subsiding, it will be a race against time for Capt Amarinder to put in place an organisational structure in such a short time. It may eventually prompt him to merge his party with the BJP. Also, the PLC has still not been allotted an election symbol by the Election Commission of India (EC) and the former chief minister continues to be its sole prominent face.

The exact numbers, however, are yet to be worked out by the three parties. While the BJP will bank upon its traditional urban vote, Amarinder will eat into the Congress vote share.

---||Chandigarh||Eyes on BJP’s plan to play big brother with Punjab's ex-CM Amarinder Singh, Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa||CHANDIGARH: This election, BJP has decided to make the contest multi-corned by forging an alliance with former chief minister Amarinder Singh’s Punjab Lok Congress (PLC) and Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa of the Sanyukt Akali Dal. While the party is hopeful of the negative sentiment over the now repealed controversial farm laws subsiding, it will be a race against time for Capt Amarinder to put in place an organisational structure in such a short time. It may eventually prompt him to merge his party with the BJP. Also, the PLC has still not been allotted an election symbol by the Election Commission of India (EC) and the former chief minister continues to be its sole prominent face.

---||Ludhiana||Hot contest: Punjab’s problem of plenty making election outcome uncertain||JALANDHAR: Punjab is facing a unique political scenario as there are not only plenty of players but also plenty of factors that will affect the outcome of the upcoming assembly elections. The state is full of exuberantly confident political outfits — the incumbent Congress, Shiromani Akali Dal alliance with Bahujan Samaj Party, Aam Aadmi Party, Bharatiya Janata Party’s tie-up with Punjab Lok Congress (PLC) and SAD (Sanyukt), and not to forget Sanyukt Samaj Morcha formed by farmer leader Balbir Singh Rajewal with some other farm unions. With no detectable wave in favour of any party, multi-cornered contests are expected in several constituencies. With a multitude of factors at play, there can be 117 battles in Punjab with micro-level factors influencing things in each constituency. Obviously, each three-cornered or multi-cornered contest can throw up surprises. The situation before the 1991 assembly polls is the only near-precedent of fluidity and uncertainty in today’s Punjab. The polls in 1991 were not held as the Election Commission of India countermanded them just a day before the polling, even as polling parties had already been despatched to their stations. The only certainty at that time, before the assembly polls, was that Congress would be out of the picture as it was not contesting the polls. However, no one could have guessed the outcome of that election. In 1991, Shiromani Akali Dal (Amritsar) led by Simranjit Singh Mann appeared as a dominant player, when other Akali factions and one major faction of All-India Sikh Students Federation (AISSF) were also contesting. BJP, Bahujan Samaj Party and communist parties, which then had a reasonable presence at some seats, were also contesting. Subsequently, the assembly election was held in February 1992 and the pattern for February after every five years was set. The Congress was voted to power through an unpopular mandate as the polling percentage according to ECI data was 23.96%, due to boycotts by all Akali factions. Three decades later, the Congress is once again at the centrestage. Punjab, where the party was once very unpopular due to the tumultuous happenings of 1984 and the subsequent years, is extremely crucial for the party for its revival at the national level. That’s the reason for BJP’s bid to block here.  Just a year ago, the Congress appeared relatively in a comfortable position as its opponents — Shiromani Akali Dal and Aam Aadmi Party — were still battling to gain ground and BJP was only a marginal player as was it was restricted in its work by the farmers’ protests and without one of its oldest allies, SAD. However, a lot has changed since April 2021. Discontentment against the then chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh was already brewing within the party as MLAs and ministers were facing heat over the performance of the government, especially on issues of Bargari sacrilege and Behbal Kalan and Kotkapura police firing cases of 2015. The Punjab and Haryana high court order in the second week of April that quashed the probe by a special investigation team in the Kotkapura police firing case accentuated the trouble. It was opposition to Amarinder which united his detractors within the party but once he was shunted out, stability and unity have been eluding the state Congress. It is the instability within Congress that has increased the fluidity in the overall political scene. Its state unit chief Navjot Singh Sidhu and chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi appear to be pulling in different directions. When Sidhu was appointed the Punjab Congress president, for a few days there seemed to be an upward push in perception, but machinations within the party and the new government undid those gains and also the perception about him. Channi’s appointment was a potential game-changer as he became the first scheduled caste Sikh CM. However, the Congress’ failure to act as a cohesive force is leading the party to squander away the gains. Sukhbir Badal-led Shiromani Akali Dal remains the most cohesive party, but is still battling to recover its lost ground in its core constituency – Sikhs. Notwithstanding Sukhbir claims, recent speeches by former CM Parkash Singh Badal and Akal Takht Jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh reflected anything but the confidence of victory. The Akali Dal’s erstwhile junior partner Bharatiya Janata Party is now out to play on its own. The party contested around one-fifth of the assembly seats in alliance with SAD, but now it is claiming it will form the next government in alliance with Amarinder’s PLC and SAD (Sanyukt). However, even Amarinder’s confidantes are preferring to join BJP rather than PLC. From these shifts, PLC appears to be more of a special purpose vehicle for these elections. BJP has also managed to induct a few prominent leaders from the Congress and Akali Dal and more can be expected in the next few days. Polarisation has been helping BJP in other states, but in Punjab it can be counter-productive. Meanwhile, Aam Aadmi Party has got back into the perception battle. Party supremo Arvind Kejriwal’s freebies and other promises, touted as “guarantees”, appear to have struck a chord with a section of voters. More than its emphasis to put itself on a high pedestal of morality (there is little talk around its ‘3C’ formula now), AAP is simply pushing the idea that both the Congress and SAD have already been tested and there is no harm in giving a chance to it. For now, AAP appears to be ahead of its rivals but to gain more on the ground, it opened talks with farm leaders and they were tricked into negotiations. The farm leaders, who are keen on joining politics to maximise gains from the Centre’s repeal of three farm laws, are now facing the heat and hurt of these talks with AAP. However, the farm groups are the biggest element of uncertainty. The farm movement added to the disenchantment with established political parties and thus increased the fluidity at ground level. Punjab remained the epicentre of the farm movement and it also has good scope for an alternative to traditional outfits. Poll data from the past confirms that this space exists and it has pushed the farm groups to jump into the fray themselves. Around 20 groups announced their decision to form Sanyukt Samaj Morcha to contest the assembly elections. Then talking to AAP created more trouble for them and led to more fissures. It was opposition to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s dispensation which united the farm groups, but flirting with AAP has fractured them. In a way what BJP and its entire ecosystem could not achieve in breaking the unity among farmers, talks with AAP did. The farm groups are still unclear about their next course of action. To top it all, how will the third wave of Covid-19 hit the country and the state has added another layer of complexity.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/hot-contest-pbs-problem-of-plenty-making-election-outcome-uncertain/articleshow/88783750.cms||IP Singh

---||---||Punjab: AAP hopes for a second chance after 2017 debacle||CHANDIGARH: After the euphoria over its campaign failed to translate into the expected number of seats during the 2017 Punjab assembly elections, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is looking for a quintessential second chance this time, hoping to expand its footprint beyond its stronghold Malwa region. Party supremo and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has managed to create a buzz by announcing freebies by way of “guarantees to voters,” making both the Congress and SAD take note. The party’s performance in Chandigarh civic polls too has boosted the cadre’s morale. Even though AAP emerged as the largest opposition group – winning 20 seats – the state unit was marred by infighting and discontentment over demand for greater autonomy for the state unit soon after. Resultantly, a chunk of the MLAs switched sides and five of them who won on AAP tickets joined the Congress. But many in the party still wonder if the AAP has learnt lessons from the 2017 debacle to handle things any differently. It continues to rely heavily on Delhi leaders like Raghav Chadha and apart from Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann, other state leaders have not been given state-wide projection. For the party, however, making Kejriwal the face of the campaign worked during the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation elections and it seems to be following a similar model in Punjab. In the run-up to the polls, the ruling Congress has focussed more on targeting AAP, an indication that the party is being taken seriously by its rivals. The party has been in the poll mode for a while, having announced most of its candidates for the 117 assembly constituencies.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/punjab/news/aap-hopes-for-a-second-chance-after-17-debacle/articleshow/88786963.cms||Vibhor Mohan

As per data compiled by the Punjab State Election Commission, of the estimated 9.3 lakh teenagers who are eligible to vote in the state, only 29.98% have registered for voting in the forthcoming state assembly elections. Punjab chief electoral officer Karuna Raju has said they will continue to enroll new voters till one week before the election to improve enrolment. According to data, only 2.8 lakh people in the 18-19 age group, also called “first-time voters”, have been enrolled to exercise their franchise. Voter enrollment is the second-worst in the age group of 20-29 years, at 67.8%. Of the projected population of 58.5 lakh people in the category, only 39.7 lakh are registered to vote. High mobility in the younger age groups and issues related to documentation due to ongoing pandemic are being given as key reasons for poor registration. Professor of population studies at the Centre for Research in Rural and Industrial Development (CRRID) Chandigarh, Aswini Kumar Nanda, stated that the younger age groups – 18-19 and 20-29 – often shift cities for education or work. Prof Nanda called for making the registration process more flexible, as it is cumbersome at present. To improve enrolment, Raju had constituted a three-member committee to identify new voters in the state, especially in the teenaged population.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/punjab/news/teenagers-fail-in-voter-enrolment-score-30/articleshow/88786934.cms||Vinod Kumar

---||Dehradun||HC stays U'khand govt from issuing operations in Nainital village under new mining policy||Nainital: Hearing a petition filed by Nainital-resident Satyendra Kumar Tomar, the Uttarakhand high court has restricted the state government from granting mining lease at Bhaursha village in Nainital to any bidder under the new mining policy that was rolled out on October 28, 2021. The HC order to the effect was released on Friday. It reads, "In the interregnum, it is directed that the respondents shall not grant any mining interests-cum-operations by way of recommendations invoking impugned notification dated 28.10.2021 qua the petitioner." The division bench of Acting Chief Justice Sanjaya Kumar Mishra and Justice Alok Kumar Verma also issued notice to the state government, director-general of mining, district mining officer of Nainital and SDM of Sadar Nainital seeking a counter-affidavit within eight weeks. The case will next be heard on March 10. The petitioner has claimed that he was granted a mining lease in the Bhaursha village under the old mining policy but the contract was retracted after the roll out of the new policy. Tomar adds that under the new "arbitrary" policy, mining lots in the area are being granted through a lottery system. The petition also alleges that the new mining policy was rolled out without taking approval from the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change. It goes on to add that mining leases were given to private individuals in the name of levelling the ground while ignoring the potential damage to the environment. The petitioner has also claimed that the due tender process was not followed while awarding mining leases. Under the new mining policy, launched with an aim to earn more revenue through open bidding, the state government gave the first right of quarrying on up to 5 hectares of land to its owner and no individual was leased out the quarrying right for two areas. The government also gave land, through open bidding, on all those reserved areas where its main three agencies -- Garhwal Mandal Vikas Nigam (GMVN), Kumaon Mandal Vikas Nigam (KMVN) and Uttarakhand Forest Development Corporation (UFDC) -- do not carry any river-bed mining. The new mining policy also banned mining/quarrying on the 15-metre wide area along both sides of rivers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/hc-stays-ukhand-govt-from-issuing-operations-in-nainital-village-under-new-mining-policy/articleshow/88780596.cms||Sonali Mishra

The colleges under Mangalore University have decided to hold online classes on Saturdays, with the introduction of weekend curfew, said P S Yadapadithaya, vice-chancellor, Mangalore University. “A majority of colleges will switch over to online classes on weekends. The complete switch over to online classes from offline will be an easy task if the need arises, due to the surge in Covid numbers, and possible lockdown. The students and lecturers have been mentally and physically prepared to hold online classes again, if the need arises. They have experience both in offline and online classes, due to the past two waves of the pandemic,” said Yadapadithaya. National Institute of Technology Karnataka (NITK) Surathkal, which is now operating in both online and offline modes, is also ready to hold classes in online mode completely, in case the need arises. K Umamaheshwar Rao, director, NITK Surathkal, told TOI that currently first and second year BTech students attend classes online. The third year and students pursuing higher studies, including MTech and postdoctoral students, attend offline classes. “We are keeping our fingers crossed about the Covid situation. All our students, including first-year BTech students, are fully vaccinated,” said Umamaheshwar Rao. Kasturba Medical College, which is holding theory classes in the online mode, ever since the pandemic hit the country, will continue with the arrangement, said college dean B Unnikrishnan. “Only practical classes and hospital visits are offline. To avoid crowding, we have reduced the group size to a maximum of five students,” he added. “We are planning to shift 50% of our campus strength to online mode, and the rest will be done offline. A final decision will be taken on Monday. On Saturdays, all classes will be held online,” said a management head of St Aloysius College, Mangaluru.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/edu-institutions-shift-focus-to-online-mode-of-classes/articleshow/88781300.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

Two rounds were fired on a 33-year-old man in Shiv Krupa Industrial in Udhna, while a 25-year-old man was chased by members of a gang with swords in their hand in Rander. Video of the attack with swords went viral on social media after which police registered an offence. In Udhna, locals nabbed Manoj Dakuva, a history sheeter, for allegedly firing at Rajesh alias Raju Vankode at a tea stall in Shiv Krupa Industrial society in Udhna at around 9pm. Dakuva and his two unidentified associates arrived at the spot and issued threats to Vankode over some dispute. It led to an argument and Vankode tried to catch them when Dakuva opened fire from a pistol he was carrying. The bullets missed the target but thankfully did not hit anyone. Meanwhile, locals came to Vankode’s help and caught the culprit. Udhna police registered an offence of attempt to murder and under Arms Act and arrested Dakuva. In Rander, Asfaq Shaikh, a resident of Rander, was chased by a group of men with swords and other weapons at around 5pm on Friday near Gulzar Apartment close to Cause-Way circle. Police booked eight persons of which four have been identified. Among those booked include Ismail Painter, Mahir Shaikh, Sajid Press and Sahid Kaliya. Shaikh suffered sword injuries all over his body and was rescued by a man on the spot. “Police recovered CCTV footage of the area.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Night curfew on, industries can’t obtain enough material||NEW DELHI: The weekend curfew and restrictions on the weekdays have drastically impacted production in industries and factories. While the units are allowed to operate on non-curfew days, the owners face problems getting the supply of raw material and movement of workers during the night. Vivek Gupta of Jhilmil Entrepreneurs Welfare Group (JEWG) said, “The workforce in second shift (or night shift) is not working on weekdays at non-essential units, while from this weekend we are keeping factories completely closed to avoid any action. We got to know that a unit in the non-essential category was sealed in Mangolpuri after 60 labourers were found working there.” Gupta said that if increased, the curfews will affect production and lead to losses. “What is even more worrying is that the labourers will go back to their home-towns and getting them back will be difficult. We have managed vaccinations for them, but they prefer to go back home if there is no job security,” he said. RK Gupta, general secretary Mayapuri-Rewari line Industrial Welfare Association, said that till now the situation is under control. “Since there were some covid cases reported in our area among workers, closing industries during weekend curfew will help break the Covid chain. But if the curfew will continue for a longer duration or a whole week in coming days, then our customers will eventually go to NCR cities as there is no restriction in Noida, Gurgaon so far,” he said. The Confederation of All India Traders stated that the imposition of various restrictions has directly impacted people in business and industries. “In Delhi, the daily business turnover is around Rs 700 crore and on Sunday, it comes down to Rs 300 crore as the majority of wholesale and retail markets remain close. But the two days of curfew lead to a loss of Rs 1,000 crore and at least Rs 250-300 crore on other days due to restrictions such as night curfew. Reduction in turnover will eventually lead to less demand from industrial units,” a member said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/night-curfew-on-industries-cant-obtain-enough-material/articleshow/88782766.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Delhi||Delhi: Registration begins, vaccine booster shot for elderly from tomorrow||NEW DELHI: The online appointment of those eligible for a booster dose of vaccine against Covid-19 started from Saturday. Delhiites aged 60 years or more, healthcare workers and frontline workers who have taken their second dose of vaccine nine months ago would become eligible for a third or ‘precautionary dose’ from Monday. According to government estimates, around 3 lakh such beneficiaries would become eligible for the booster shot on January 10 as they have received their second dose nine months or 39 weeks ago. Those whose third dose would become due in the coming days would also receive a SMS from the CoWIN system. While the beneficiaries can now book an appointment online, they also have the option of getting registered on site through ‘walk-in’ mode. The beneficiaries, however, wouldn’t have to open a fresh account as their existing CoWIN account would be used for booking appointments, and also for receiving a digital vaccination certificate. The beneficiaries will receive the third dose of the same vaccine that has been administered for the previous two doses. ‘The private hospitals that function as Covid-19 vaccination centres can vaccinate their staff (doctors, paramedics, etc) at their hospital itself. They may choose to bear the cost of the vaccine doses and provide the precaution dose to their staff who are eligible and due, free of cost or they may provide such vaccination and charge for it,” a circular issued by the Delhi government’s directorate of family welfare stated. Teens in the 15-17 years age group started receiving their first dose of vaccine against Covid-19 from the previous Monday, January 3. Till 9.30 pm on Saturday, those in the 15-17 years age group had received 2,42,307 first doses of Covaxin, including 37,410 doses on Saturday. As per Delhi government data, out of the more than 2.4 lakh beneficiaries vaccinated till Saturday in this cohort, the highest numbers were seen at the North East district – 37,532. Second in the tally was the South West district (30,620), which also boasts of the highest number of government vaccination centres – 21. The Central district was the only revenue district that recorded less than 17,000 vaccinations. The district had administered vaccine doses to 16,950 teens till Saturday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/registration-begins-vax-booster-shot-for-elderly-from-tomorrow/articleshow/88782772.cms||Sidharatha Roy

This time, even the BJP, which has broken ties with the SAD and has tied up with splinter groups of Congress and the Akali Dal (Punjab Lok Congress formed by former chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh and SAD (Sanyukt) formed by former Union minister Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa), has not announced any of its candidates. The Akali Dal is contesting on 97 seats and has left 20 seats for its alliance partner, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP). It has announced 93 candidates so far. The AAP is expected to contest all the 117 seats and has so far announced its candidates for 104 seats. Farmers front Sanyukt Samaj Morcha (SSM) too has decided to contest all 117 seats and is yet to announce its candidates. Likewise, Haryana-based farmer leader Gurnam Singh Charuni has formed Sanyukt Sangharsh Party to contest Punjab elections and has not declared its candidates as yet. “It is said that the Congress had to face loss for late announcing the candidates as some of them who fail to get party ticket turn rebels and the party is left with very little time in prevailing upon rebels to retire from fray. This is happening again and the party may have to face all this rebel activity when it will announce the candidates,” said a senior Congress leader, not wanting to be named. He added that this time the situation could be more complex in the distribution of tickets and tackling the rebels, if any as there are more leaders at the helm of affairs like PCC president Navjot Singh Sidhu, CM Charanjit Singh Channi, campaign committee head Sunil Jakhar and things may not be easy for them to act effectively in unison.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/amritsar/cong-bjp-lag-in-race-to-name-nominees/articleshow/88783754.cms||Neel Kamal

---||---||Punjab polls: Turncoats turn on parties for tickets||CHANDIGARH: As party-hopping becomes a norm during the polls, many turncoats in Punjab have benefitted by getting poll tickets from their desired assembly constituencies from their new political outfits. The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) got a big boost after the Taksali leader and former MP Ranjit Singh Brahmpura returned to his parent party on December 23 last year within three years of quitting in 2018. Brahmpura, who was the patron of the Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa-led Shiromani Akali Dal(Sanyukt), has been announced as the SAD candidate from the Khadoor Sahib constituency. Former cabinet minister and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) ex-convenor in Punjab Sucha Singh Chhotepur joined the SAD on December 9 last year and was declared as its candidate from the Batala assembly segment. Prominent Hindu leader and ex-cabinet minister Anil Joshi, who was expelled by the BJP in July last year for anti-party activities, joined the Sukhbir Singh Badal-led party a month later and got the ticket to contest from Amritsar North. Similarly, ex-Congress MP Jagmeet Singh Brar who had joined the SAD in April 2019 ahead of the Lok Sabha polls and is known as an experienced politician, had been fielded by the SAD from Maur assembly seat. Former SAD MLA Jagbir Singh Brar who quit the party to join the People’s Party of Punjab (PPP) and later jumped on the Congress bandwagon, rejoined the SAD on August 16 last year and was fielded by the SAD to contest from Jalandhar Cantt. Two-time cabinet minister and Congress OBC leader Hans Raj Joshan joined the SAD in April last year. The SAD has shown faith in his leadership by fielding him from the Fazilka assembly segment. Also, two-time MLA from Congress and a prominent Hindu leader Mohinder Kumar Rinwa had joined the SAD in May last year and has been given the ticket for the assembly polls from Abohar. Prominent turncoats in BJPThe saffron party got the biggest catch from the ruling Congress in Rana Gurmit Singh Sodhi, who is an ex-cabinet minister and sitting MLA from Guru Har Sahai. Though the BJP-PLC-SAD (Sanyukt) alliance is yet to announce tickets, it is unlikely that he would be denied the candidature. Similarly, the sitting Congress MLA from Qadian Fateh Jung Singh Bajwa joined the BJP last month. Though Sri Hargobindpur Congress MLA Balwinder Singh Laddi had also joined the BJP on December 28 last year along with Bajwa, the Congress later managed to pull him back on January 3 after assuring him the party ticket from his constituency. Former MP of Shiromani Akali Dal (Panthic) from Sangrur Rajdev Singh Khalsa joined the BJP on December 28 along with Gurtej Singh Ghuriana, three-time former MLA of the SAD from Baluana reserve constituency in Fazilka district. Former SAD MLA Sarabjit Singh Makkar, who had been constituency in charge of Jalandhar Cantt, joined the BJP last month. Loyalty changes in AAPFormer basketball player and Arjuna Awardee Sajjan Singh Cheema, who had unsuccessfully contested on the AAP ticket from Sultanpur Lodhi in 2017 assembly polls and had later jumped to SAD in April 2019, returned to AAP in Junelast year. He has now been fielded by AAP from Sultanpur Lodhi. Congress leader Sukhjinder Raj Singh Lalli Majithia, who had unsuccessfully contested against the SAD leader Bikram Singh Majithia thrice, joined the AAP earlier this month and has been announced party’s candidate from Majitha. Similarly, BJP leader Sheetal Angural had joined the AAP last month and has been given a ticket from the Jalandhar West constituency. The AAP had on December 11 announced tickets to six such leaders who had shifted their loyalties to the party.  These included former Congress MP Jagdev Singh Khudian’s son Gurmeet Singh Khudian from Lambi, Congress’s Hindu leader Raman Behl from Gurdaspur and Congress’s former state secretary Kulwant Singh Sidhu from Atam Nagar. The AAP also fielded Lok Insaf Party leader Manwinder Singh Giaspura from Payal. Party hoppers in CongressAAP MLA from Raikot Jagtar Singh Jagga and AAP MLA from Bathinda Rupinder Kaur Ruby had joined the Congress in November last year.

---||Chandigarh||VK Bhawra is new Punjab DGP; 3rd in three months||CHANDIGARH: The Punjab government on Saturday appointed a 1987-batch IPS officer, VK Bhawra, as the new head of the state police force, barely hours before the Election Commission's announcement on assembly polls in the state, replacing Siddharth Chattopadhyaya. Bhawra is the third DGP on the post in just three months of the Congress government led by Charanjit Channi. Chattopadhyaya replaced senior IPS officer Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota merely three weeks back in mid-December.  After taking over the charge of Punjab director general of police, Bhawra said the Punjab Police will ensure smooth conduct of elections and that they are held in an inducement free manner. Apart from ensuring smooth conduct of elections, Bhawra said the focus would be on eradicating drugs and terrorism from the state. He added that people-centric policing and public service delivery are among his top priorities. The DGP said the force would make optimum use of technology for carrying out investigations of the various crimes. The election commission had in October 2016 handpicked Bhawra as nodal officer for the 2017 Punjab assembly elections. During his central deputation earlier, Bhawra served in the intelligence bureau. The Punjab government, which wanted the UPSC to consider officiating state police head and 1986-batch IPS officer Siddharth Chattopadhyaya among the three suitable officers for the post, had to face embarrassment as the UPSC dropped Chattopadhyaya's name since he is superannuating on March 31.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/bhawra-is-new-punjab-dgp-3rd-in-three-months/articleshow/88783756.cms||---

In this case, the couple was living separately for around 18 years and the woman was not ready to settle the dispute amicably. While the husband wanted a divorce and was ready to pay one-time alimony so that he could move ahead in life, the woman was not willing to give divorce. After hearing both the parties, the HC observed that, in the present case, the appellant and the respondent-wife have been living separately since November 2003. The HC thereafter made several attempts to settle the dispute amicably between the parties. The appellant-husband made an offer of Rs7.5 lakhs to his wife if she agreed to divorce through mutual consent. On this, the woman, who works as a permanent lecturer, was given time to think about the man's offer. However, on October 12, 2021, the court was informed that the woman was not ready to give mutual divorce to the appellant-husband. "The wife, who is a permanent lecturer, could use the above money to secure her future. Now, once the respondent-wife who is not staying with the appellant for the last about 18 years and is not ready to give mutual divorce to the appellant-husband. In the present case, firstly efforts were made to resolve the matrimonial dispute through the process of mediation, which is one of the effective modes of alternative mechanism in resolving the personal dispute but the mediation failed between the parties... keeping in view the extraordinary facts and circumstances of the case, the appeal is allowed and judgment dated May 4, 2015, passed by the district judge, Gurugram family court is set aside and the decree of divorce is granted to the parties," the HC ordered while allowing the husband's plea.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/disastrous-not-to-grant-divorce-if-marriage-has-broken-down-hc/articleshow/88783758.cms||Ajay Sura

He also claims that the party is all set to announce its CM face. Election Commission has announced the poll schedule, is AAP ready?We are roaring to go; AAP is absolutely ready to enter the poll fray with the announcement of schedule for the Punjab elections. How do you react to EC’s restrictions on campaigning in view of surge in Covid-19 cases?We understand that while we have to conduct elections for the sake of democracy, we also have to ensure the safety of our fellow citizens. Therefore, we will also focus on virtual campaigning and then take a call on January 15, based on the revised guidelines. We will abide by the directions of the EC. In the previous elections, it had been a mix of mediums. Now, all parties will have to devise new strategies to put across their message to the voters. Does AAP plan to announce a CM face before polling?Of course, we will do it soon. The party leadership has said that so many times that we will announce a CM face. Do you see an impact of the AAP’s performance in the Chandigarh civic body in Punjab? It was a trailer and what it essentially conveys is that the voters’ mode is for change. In Chandigarh Municipal Corporation, BJP was in power for 13 years and the Congress for 112 years. People were fed up with them and voted for change. Similarly, in the Punjab assembly, since 1966, there have been 26 years of the Congress and 24 years of Akalis.

---||Amritsar||Punjab: High over victory, 20-odd farm groups to test political prowess this election||BATHINDA: On a high after forcing the Union government to repeal the three contentious farm laws last year, nearly 20 farmer groups have joined active politics to capitalise on their unprecedented achievement. They have come together to form a political front, Sanyukt Samaj Morcha with senior farmer leader Balbir Singh Rajewal as its chief ministerial candidate. These groups have held a number of meetings and finer details are being worked out to register their political front. However, with polls barely five weeks away, they could even opt to contest independently. A common minimum programme is also being prepared for the elections and the issues concerning farmers and other sections of society are being identified. Senior farmer leader Ruldu Singh Mansa, who is part of SSM, told TOI: “Over 20 farmer groups are together to contest the elections. Apart from farmer organisations, the other social and civil society groups too are coming together. We are collecting details to get the morcha registered with the Election Commission of India as we want that all the contestants get a common symbol. The elections will be contested under the leadership of Rajewal. The electioneering will be started very soon.” The morcha was involved in talks with Aam Aadmi Party convener Arvind Kejriwal for an alliance but no formal announcement has been made till now. Even as AAP has already declared over 100 candidates for the 117-member assembly, it is still not clear whether the farmer morcha will have an alliance with AAP or it will contest all the seats on its own. The morcha had initially claimed on December 25, when the political front was announced, that it would contest all seats on its own. The insiders, however, say that the possibility of any alliance with AAP has diminished. Going by it, the SSM has started widening its ambit by taking along various other groups like writers, singers, intellectuals, academics, and even retired civil servants. Haryana-based farmer leader Gurnam Singh Charuni too has formed his own political outfit, Sanyukt Sangharsh Party, and announced it would contest elections in Punjab. Charuni, however, was clear that he would not contest the polls. “We are ready to contest the elections and soon the first list of candidates will be announced. Our candidates have started the campaigning,” Charuni told TOI. It is not yet clear whether Charuni’s Sanyukt Sangharsh Party will have any tie-up with the Sanyukt Samaj Morcha. Charuni, who faced disciplinary action from SKM for indicating his interest in active politics during the farmers’ agitation, confirmed some talks have been held with Sanyukt Samaj Morcha for some kind of alliance, but not much headway has been till now.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/amritsar/high-over-victory-20-odd-farm-groups-to-test-political-prowess-this-election/articleshow/88783764.cms||Neel Kamal

Charuni, who faced disciplinary action from SKM for indicating his interest in active politics during the farmers’ agitation, confirmed some talks have been held with Sanyukt Samaj Morcha for some kind of alliance, but not much headway has been till now.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/punjab/news/high-over-victory-20-odd-farm-groups-to-test-political-prowess-this-election/articleshow/88786992.cms||Neel Kamal
---||---||Gender matters: AAP, SAD, Congress woo women in Punjab||BATHINDA: In the run-up to assembly elections in Punjab, political parties have so far touched many real issues, but have also reached out to one of the most vital voting constituencies — women, who comprise 47.4% of the state’s 2.12 crore electors. When compared to previous campaigns,the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and Congress have made bigger announcements for women this time around. Every party gas claimed that the money will be generated by eliminating “mafias”mushrooming in Punjab. It started with SAD announcing Rs 2,000 per month to women in its 13-points agenda of assurances. AAP upped this to what it called a “guarantee”, when party supremo Arvind Kejriwal, at a public meeting with women in Moga on November 22, promised to give Rs 1,000 per month to every woman above the age of 18 years in the state. Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu went many steps ahead on January 3, when he made a commitment of making women a partner in economic development at a rally in Sehna village of Barnala. Sidhu announced that every homemaker will be provided Rs 2,000 per month and eight LPG cylinders for free in a year to run the household. He also promised financial benefits to improve girl education. He said to control the school dropout rate among girls, those who pass Class V would be given Rs 5,000, those who passed Class VIII would be provided Rs 10,000, and girls who passed Class X will be given Rs 15,000. He promised Rs 20,000 to all girls who pass Class XII. He added if a girl wanted to continue her studies, she would be provided a tablet for studing and a scooty for travelling. He said the benefit would be available to all girls, and these would not be based on caste or economic condition. Sidhu also announced transfer of property in the name of women without any fee, and opening of 23 skill development centres for women to impart them job-oriented training. He added an interest-free loan of up to Rs 2 lakh will be provided to women to start any business and vocation. However, even Congress minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu’s wife, Mamta Bhushan, and Congress former minister Malti Thapar criticised these announcements, saying these were just attempts to take Punjabi women on a ride.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/punjab/news/gender-matters-aap-sad-cong-woo-women/articleshow/88786988.cms||Neel Kamal

---||Chandigarh||Covid-19: No containment in poll-bound Punjab||CHANDIGARH: Despite a deluge of Covid cases, Punjab appears to be not doing enough to contain the spread of the virus, if the count of areas earmarked as containment zones across the state is an indicator. The state has been noting an exponential growth in cases since January 1. However, during the last seven days, the number of new containment zones identified in affected areas during the period has been way lower than the growth of cases. Identification of containment zones, which intends to break the cycle of transmission, is considered a check measure. Activities in containment zones include house to house search for cases, testing, contact identification, listing, tracing and establishing clear entry and exit points to stop the spread outside the given area. From January 1 to 7, the daily caseload has jumped from 332 to 2,901, a rise of 747%. However, the number of areas demarcated as micro containment zones — having cases between 5 to 14 — went up from 12 to 17, of which 11 are in Ludhiana and 6 in Jalandhar, having a collective population of 2,378, where containment efforts are being carried. As per the information shared by the health department in media bulletin, there are no containment zones — areas having 15 or more cases — in the state, despite several districts becoming epicentre of the spread. The surge has pushed the number of active cases in the seven-day period to 9,425 from 1,041, a massive growth of over 805.% During the second wave, when the state was facing a similar situation with a number of active cases standing at 9,479 on July 17, there were 63 micro containment zones in 15 districts where 12,029 people were under surveillance while there were 14 containment zones in 11 districts with a population of 29,300. Eight districts — Ludhiana (9.79%), Amritsar (8.60%), Jalandhar (8.37%), Ropar (7.29%), Fatehgarh Sahib (6.48%), Hoshiarpur (5.54%) and Sangrur (5.13%) — clocked weekly positivity rate over the 5% recommended limit of World Health Organisation. Out of these districts, containment zones have been earmarked in only two. Besides, Patiala and Pathankot are the two other worst-hit districts where no areas have been demarcated as containment zone. Such laxity at a time when election related activities are at peak can prove detrimental.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/no-containment-in-poll-bound-punjab/articleshow/88783770.cms||Vinod Kumar

---||Guwahati||5 skulls of Capped Langur species found in Assam||GUWAHATI: Five skulls of a sub-species of the Capped Langur, listed as an endangered primate by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), were found in Behali reserve forest of northern Assam, a forest officer said on Saturday. Capped Langur is listed in Schedule 1 of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act 1972. Suspected to be killed in the last 15 days to one month by hunters for their tail and skin, the killings of these primates have astonished forest officials.  Though tribes in adjacent Arunachal Pradesh used to hunt earlier in the reserve forest that once used to be a safe heaven for poaching activities, the forest department is sniffing the role of armed smugglers as intrusion of residents from Arunachal has been kept under strict surveillance by the administration and locals. The incident was first brought to the notice of the forest department on January 4 in a search with NGO members. But despite interrogating some locals, the forest department is yet to make a breakthrough. “Without sophisticated arms, it may not be that easy to catch the primates,” a forest department official said. Though local communities from Assam side seem to be free from the suspicion of the investigating officials, meat-eating tribesmen from bordering Arunachal are under the radar. “Considering the past history of some residents in the bordering zone for whom meat is the primary food, it is suspected that they are behind the killings,” the official added. Forest range officer of Bargang Chakrapani Ray did not rule out the possibility of death of the primates due to poisoning and disease. “Recovery of five skulls in one place can not be taken easily. Without forensic lab analysis, it’s going to be difficult to come to a conclusion. Only the skulls and one bone could be recovered,” he said on Saturday. A case has been registered by the forest department and it has forwarded a preliminary offence report to the Biswanath CJM court. “Investigation will go on and case diaries will be submitted,” he added. Parixit Kafley, an executive member of Nature’s Bonyapran NGO, said, “Encroachment is one of the biggest issues here. Tribals who have their origins in Arunachal were known for killing these langurs. Out of the three subspecies of the Capped Langur, the one to which these five belonged was the most endangered.” Kafley said the tail and skin of these langurs are now used to decorate their traditional scabbard, which they may be trying to commercialize. “The demand for skin in the grey market is yet to be investigated,” he added. Hog deer, wild boar, elephant, leopard cat, jungle cat and fishing cat as well as gaur are found in the Behali reserve forest.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/5-skulls-of-capped-langur-species-found-in-assam/articleshow/88783775.cms||Kangkan Kalita

Mubarak, who was driving the car, sustained bullet injuries in his right shoulder and chest, managed to escape from the spot, they added. Zia-Ul-Haque, a resident of ward No 7, then drove the car up to Mission Veng in ward 2, abandoned the vehicle and fled. Mubarak, who was treated at a health centre in Moreh, was later referred to a hospital in Imphal. The police have launched a search in different areas of Moreh to arrest the accused. They have also registered a case in connection with the incident.An irate mob on Saturday morning vandalised the house of Zia-Ul-Haque, the sources said. Three Moreh-based civil rights groups — Manipuri Muslim Council, Gurkha Samaj Samiti and Hill Tribal Council — have demanded the state government to arrest the culprits at the earliest and grant ex gratia of Rs 10 lakh and provide a government job to the family of the deceased. Besides Zia-Ul-Haque, another unidentified person was involved in the crime, they said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/imphal/youth-shot-dead-another-injured-in-moreh/articleshow/88783776.cms||K Sarojkumar Sharma

The Commission stated that the instructions were issued when it reviewed the poll preparedness in Manipur on Wednesday, which was marked by a common concern raised by all political parties about use of money power, illicit liquor, narcotics drugs and intimidation to influence voters. Except for few patches of fencing, a large tract of the 398-km-long border between Manipur and Myanmar lies porous and offers a free passage to militants, gunrunners and gold and drug smugglers. Besides, all the insurgent outfits of Manipur, about seven, are based in Myanmar, close to the international border. On November 13 last year, insurgents based in Myanmar carried out the deadliest attack in Manipur in six years in which the commanding officer of 46 Assam Rifles, Col Viplav Tripathi, his wife, six-year-old son and four personnel of the accompanying quick reaction team (QRT) were killed in an ambush in Churachandpur district near the India-Myanmar border. While reviewing the law-and-order issues, the Commission directed that deposition of licensed arms in the state should be expedited. It was directed to ensure that distribution of liquor, drugs, freebies and cash is effectively checked and the electoral process is not vitiated with unlawful activities. The Commission stated that political parties requested for strict vigil on election expenses by candidates to ensure free and fair polls. “While expressing concern about pre-poll violence, the political parties demanded deployment of adequate security forces during the poll process and other relevant measures. The political parties also raised concerns about implementation of strict COVID protocols for safety of everybody,” the Commission stated. In response, the Commission “assured the representatives that it has taken cognizance of suggestions, issues and concerns of the political parties and ECI is committed to conduct free, fair, participative, inclusive, inducement free and COVID safe elections in the state.” Chief election commissioner Sushil Chandra has underscored that strict action would be taken against such erring officials.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/imphal/ensure-strict-vigil-on-myanmar-border-ec/articleshow/88783778.cms||Prabin Kalita

In Guwahati, which has been witnessing the highest daily cases in the state, most people are being allowed home quarantine. However, at 6.47%, the positivity rate in Kamrup (Metro) is almost double the state’s latest daily positivity rate of 3.73%. As per Saturday morning report, there were 319 Covid patients admitted in GMCH. In the GMCH emergency ward, 92 patients were admitted, whereas 11 in the ICU unit. In the GMCH Covid paying cabin, there were 39 cases and at Sarusajai CCC, 177 patients were admitted. “In GMCH ICU, out of 11 patients, three cases on oxygen support. As of now, the severity of this wave of Covid-19 appears to be moderate,” GMCH superintendent Dr Abhijit Sarma told TOI. The state on Saturday reported 1,254 cases, which has gone up from 1,167 logged on Friday. The positivity rate too has further inched up from 3.32 to 3.73%, even as the daily test numbers declined to 33,609. Over 35,000 samples were tested in the state on the previous day.

The time-table of the class 10 board exams was announced on Friday. Senior officials in the education department told TOI that the boards cannot take any decision on the postponement or cancellation of exams, unless the government intervenes. State board officials said the Class 12 exams will commence in March and will continue till the first half of April.Experts from the academic circles were taken aback as the Board of Secondary Education (Seba) declared the exam schedule for class 10 state board examination on Friday, the day when chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma announced fresh restrictions amid rising cases of Covid. According to the new curbs, physical presence upto class 8 in Guwahati and upto class 5 elsewhere in the state have been restricted till January 30.“We are preparing the schedule for class 12 state board exam from March. It will be held almost simultaneously with class 10 board exam schedule,” AHSEC secretary Pulak Patgiri told TOI on Saturday. He said it needs comprehensive planning to conduct exams for diverse subjects as the AHSEC has 84 subjects to offer students. Boards officials were hopeful of conducting the exams on time as the state government has planned to fully vaccinate all board examinees before the commencement of the board exams. Practical exams for 16 subjects for class 10 candidates will be held on March 4 and 5. Rest of the main exams will be held from March 15 to 31. Around 4.33 lakh candidates are scheduled to appear in over 900 exam centres in the state this year. “We cannot keep on speculating about the Covid situation ahead. Since there is no such SOP to cancel or postpone the board exams, we are going ahead with our timely plan,” said Seba controller of examinations, NJ Sarmah.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/ahsec-to-announce-class-12-board-exam-schedule-soon/articleshow/88783781.cms||---

Dr Lal Singh who was on emergency duty at district hospital said the victim suffered 96% burn injuries and her condition was critical. She was later referred to Agra after her health worsened. According to her family members, she took the extreme step as the police were not taking action against those who molested her in 2017. They had been, in fact, harassing her to withdraw her complaint. However, police claimed that the woman had come with her husband to give an application regarding a dispute with some people on the issue of flooding of their field, when she tried to kill herself around 12 pm. SSP Gaurav Grover said, "This was a separate dispute from her 2017 FIR. In the earlier case, the accused, Harishchand, was arrested under IPC section 354 (assault on woman, intending to outrage modesty) and a chargesheet was filed against him. On Saturday, the woman along with her husband had come to file a complaint. The matter is being probed in detail now." The SSP added that an FIR will be registered as per the complaint given by the victim’s husband.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/no-action-against-molesters-woman-sets-herself-ablaze-in-front-of-up-thana/articleshow/88781327.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Dehradun||Aggressive testing need of the hour: Health experts||Dehradun: Despite health officials claiming that extensive testing is being done at border points and in the city, experts have called for a more aggressive approach towards tackling the raging pandemic. The average number of samples being tested every day in the state is around 18,000 while in Dehradun, it is around 3,500 despite the capital reporting the maximum number of cases. “The state itself had one month ago set a target of 25,000 tests per day. However, we are nowhere near that goal. Since then, the number of cases has gone up drastically. While we should be increasing the target further, we have not been able to reach the initial goal. This needs to change,” said Anoop Nautiyal, founder, SDC foundation. Experts believe that the city requires targeted testing in hotspots and sensitive areas based on the research of the last two years. “It is impossible that we only have eight Omicron cases. We need to ramp up testing to identify transmission sources. Somebody has to take ownership of public safety,” said Nautiyal. Meanwhile, health officials claim that they are now testing everyone coming into the district across any border point, be it ISBT, railway station or airport. However, a spot visit to Dehradun railway station revealed empty testing booths. A senior health official blamed the inclement weather for the reduced testing in the last two days. Officials continue to maintain that they are working on increasing the testing further. “We have engaged three labs for results. The department is also pushing for random testing within the city at public places like the clock tower or Ballupur chowk where the public could simply get tested without the hassle of going to a hospital. The emergency control room also has details of five physicians who can be reached out to for any Covid-related issue,” said chief medical officer, Dr Manoj Upreti. Officials are also urging the public to take all necessary precautions and follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. On Saturday, 1,560 new cases were reported in the state, bringing the total number of active cases to 3,254 of which 1,157 are from Dehradun alone.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/aggressive-testing-need-of-the-hour-health-experts/articleshow/88780626.cms||Tanmayee Tyagi
---||---||Uttar Pradesh election: Double-engine driven BJP in fray against geared-up opposition||The stage is set for 2022 UP assembly elections. While the BJP believes that its ‘Double Engine’ with support of some smaller parties like Apna Dal will bulldoze the opposition again, SP hopes to withstand the saffron charge by knitting an alliance with local OBC satraps including Rashtriya Lok Dal and SBSP among others. BSP’s attempt is to make the contest three-cornered by experimenting with its Dalit-Brahmin combination again, while Congress is desperately trying to stay afloat by carving a new ‘women vote bank’. Here’s what victory or defeat in the polls would mean for various parties and their leaders.Bharatiya Janata Party To retain power, BJP will have to repeat the dominance with which it devastated the opposition in 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha and 2017 assembly elections. It’s a challenging task in view of the farmers’ movement and spiralling inflation. The party has put its best foot forward by playing the development and nationalism card along with polarisation. A divided opposition will also be an advantage. The victory would make Yogi Adityanath the first chief minister after Sampoornanand to get a consecutive second term and put him on the path of becoming Narendra Modi’s successor in national politics. A defeat in the elections, however, may force the party to rethink its 2024 strategy because the reputation of double engine – Modi and Yogi Ki Sarkar — is at stake.

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh election: Double-engine driven BJP in fray against geared-up opposition||The stage is set for 2022 UP assembly elections. While the BJP believes that its ‘Double Engine’ with support of some smaller parties like Apna Dal will bulldoze the opposition again, SP hopes to withstand the saffron charge by knitting an alliance with local OBC satraps including Rashtriya Lok Dal and SBSP among others. BSP’s attempt is to make the contest three-cornered by experimenting with its Dalit-Brahmin combination again, while Congress is desperately trying to stay afloat by carving a new ‘women vote bank’. Here’s what victory or defeat in the polls would mean for various parties and their leaders.Bharatiya Janata Party To retain power, BJP will have to repeat the dominance with which it devastated the opposition in 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha and 2017 assembly elections. It’s a challenging task in view of the farmers’ movement and spiralling inflation. The party has put its best foot forward by playing the development and nationalism card along with polarisation. A divided opposition will also be an advantage. The victory would make Yogi Adityanath the first chief minister after Sampoornanand to get a consecutive second term and put him on the path of becoming Narendra Modi’s successor in national politics. A defeat in the elections, however, may force the party to rethink its 2024 strategy because the reputation of double engine – Modi and Yogi Ki Sarkar — is at stake.

Addressing the 15th annual convocation of National University of Advanced Legal Studies (NUALS) at Kochi, the minister said access to justice should be made easier and that nobody should be made to struggle to get justice. “The gap between the common man and justice must be reduced,” he said while stressing the need for the government and the judiciary to work together to achieve it. The minister added that lives of judges are not easy and narrated his experience with the Chief Justice of India continuing a meeting at midnight and then sitting up to read the case of the next day. The minister further said he is aware of the challenges of lack of infrastructure in the lower judiciary and pointed out that the last Union cabinet approved Rs 9,000 crore for creating better infrastructure for the subordinate judiciary. Sixty per cent of it will be funded by the central government and 40% by the state governments, he said. Addressing a South India-level conference of central government counsels at the Kerala high court’s auditorium later, the minister said some people in the country are not even aware of the process of reaching out to the courts. “Many people, especially in rural India, have to struggle just to get a bare minimum of their entitlement,” the minister said. He has seen many who had to sell off their properties to pay court fees and to pay the fees of their advocates, the minister added while calling for concerted action to ensure access to justice and avoid delay. Talking about independence of the judiciary, the minister said, “I truly believe in the independence of the judiciary, but that does not stop us (government) from having a very cordial and seamless coordination and relationship.” The minister also said faith of the common man on judiciary must be maintained. “It is not only incumbent upon the judges but all of us to ensure that the faith of the common people upon the judiciary is maintained at any cost,” he said. Further, the minister said he has ensured that appointment of judges is being given priority. “It needs to be given a push and for that, it is not the government alone but the collegium as well as the government must work in tandem. We are doing everything possible,” the minister said. During the speech at NUALS, the minister also called for simplifying the laws so that the common man can understand them and said the government is working to repeal obsolete laws and to simplify them.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/rijiju-reduce-gap-between-common-man-and-justice/articleshow/88783795.cms||---

After the incident, the woman’s father filed a complaint before Idukki SP Karuppasamy R alleging that the CPO was behind his daughter’s suicide. The SP then deputed Lal to probe the incident and the CPO’s suspension was based on the primary inquiry report.“The CPO, who is already married with children, was in a relationship with Swapna while he was posted at Munnar police station. Based on a complaint by the woman’s father, higher officials had then warned him and transferred to Shantanpara. But he continued the relationship and wrongly convinced Swapna that he was divorced, and had given false promises of marriage. But recently, the Swapna realized that he was not divorced. Thus, the girl was in deep mental stress before taking the extreme step,” said Lal. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/cop-suspended-after-school-staff-kills-self/articleshow/88783796.cms||---

Inaugurating the convention of party’s officer bearers from Alappuzha, Thrissur, Kottayam and Ernakulam, Sudhakaran said that the conventions would be organized at Thiruvananthapuram, Kochi, Kozhikode and Kannur or Kasaragod, as a strong reply to the chief minister’s ongoing programme of meeting prominent citizens at major centres across the state to explain K-Rail project. “Around 5,000 people from all political parties will attend each convention, which would turn into a strong protest programme, against the SilverLine project. Party will launch a strong campaign programme through door-to-door visits in the coming days across the state. Party members will identify all the affected ones and visit their families. After the convention we will go for public protests across the state”, said K Sudhakaran.Sudhakaran said that the controversy over K-Rail is a golden opportunity for Congress to bring down Pinarayi from CM’s post and the party should utilize the chance cleverly. “Government can take measures to improve the existing rail system. The government can start flight services between cities in Kerala using airports in all major cities in the state,” he said. Meanwhile, Sudhakaran, in Thrissur on Saturday alleged that the chief minister is keen to implement the K-Rail project because of his craving to wrest commission from various suppliers and contractors.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/cong-to-hold-conventions-to-counter-cms-meetings/articleshow/88783798.cms||---
