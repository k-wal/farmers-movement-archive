It also stated that there could be changes in tax concessions, while production-linked incentive (PLI) schemes may see higher allocation to push investment demand. To avoid bond market volatility, gross borrowing will likely be maintained in the range of Rs 12-13 lakh crore, despite higher repayment obligations. Thus the estimated fiscal deficit is expected to be between 6 per cent and 6.25 per cent in the 2022-23 fiscal, the report said. In line with a 13 per cent increase in nominal gross domestic product, the Centre's net revenue is estimated to rise by 12.2 per cent and spending to increase by 4.5 per cent in the coming fiscal, it said. Assuming that a large part of the divestment target in the current fiscal will be met, the expected disinvestment proceeds in the next financial year will be around Rs 75,000 crore, the report claimed. According to it, the fiscal deficit will be financed by market borrowing next fiscal. The report also mentioned that the gross tax revenue to GDP ratio is expected to remain broadly unchanged. Higher nominal GDP will imply that gross revenue will increase to Rs 26.5 lakh crore in the next fiscal from Rs 22.2 lakh crore as per current fiscal budget estimates. The upcoming budget may focus on increasing the standard deduction limit for the salaried class by Rs 50,000. Overall, there could be a balance between consumption and investment centric policies, the report added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/union-budget-likely-to-aim-at-boosting-growth-achieving-fiscal-consolidation-bob-economic-research/articleshow/89187962.cms||---

In an exclusive interview with ANI, AEPC chairman Narendra Goenka, who believes apparel exports would touch $20 billion in fiscal 2022-23, said the biggest hurdle is high raw material prices and removal of import duty on these could give a major fillip. "We need to stop import duty on raw cotton. It is our major demand because raw material prices in India are very high. Cotton prices have gone up by almost 70-80 per cent in the last one year. A solution could be the removal of 11 per cent import duty on cotton. So that the mills can import cotton at lower prices. Cotton and yarn prices have gone up by 70-80 per cent and that is creating hurdles for garment exports. So, that is our major one-point demand from the budget," said Goenka. Further, he said that the government should also reintroduce the duty-free facility for importing trimmings and embellishments that foreign buyers demand from outside India. He said this should be provided as the imported items are finally exported. "Trimmings and embellishments like tags, labels and buttons that are used for branding and are nominated by the buyers were allowed duty-free till two years back. That has been removed and we are requesting to reinstate that facility because we have to import those trimmings from buyers' nominated sources. We have requested the government in this budget to reinstate that facility for up to 5 per cent of our FOB based on last year's performance," Goenka said. He said that the import duty on raw materials has made Indian apparel expensive and less competitive in the international market. Apart from the removal of import duties, Goenka feels there is an urgent need for building additional production capacity and promoting brand India as there is good demand in the export market. "We need to expand our production capacity. That is our biggest challenge because there is a good demand. And, then create a little more positivity about Indian apparel. We need to create a brand India by some export promotion efforts in the international market where people can see what we have. We have fibre to fashion capability. We have raw material abundance and we also create good fashion. We want to project this. We are sustainable, compliant. We want to create a global image of brand India so that it helps us increase the confidence of our buyers and retailers," he said. Goenka also stressed upon the need to fast track negotiations and sign Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with major buying destinations like the EU, the UK, Australia and others. This will remove the duty disadvantages that Indian apparel faces, he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/apparel-export-promotion-council-urges-government-to-remove-import-duty-on-cotton-to-boost-exports/articleshow/89188115.cms||---
---||Goa||Jamshedpur make it three wins in a row as FC Goa suffer for lack of sharpness upfrontṭ||Jamshedpur FC are grinding out results that is certain to win them a playoff spot for the first time in their history, and maybe make it an even better season. After narrow victories against NorthEast United (3-2) and SC East Bengal (1-0), Jamshedpur registered their third win in a row, this time against FC Goa, who they defeated by a solitary goal at the GMC Athletic Stadium in Bambolim on Friday. After a barren first session, Daniel Chima struck on debut for Jamshedpur in the 49th minute, a goal – scored from a suspiciously offside position – that separated the two sides till the final whistle. The win meant Jamshedpur now have 22 points from 12 matches, just one less than table toppers Hyderabad who have played an additional game. Jamshedpur had won the first leg 3-1 at the same venue. For Goa, this defeat probably looks like their season is over. There are six games still left to be played, 18 points to fight for, but for a team that has scored just four goals in their last five matches and won just once in nine games, there’s very little hope. The 90 minutes against Jamshedpur summed up their season. The former League champions had 63 percent ball possession, 11 shots – three on target – and more than 500 passes. But with Jamshedpur defending in numbers, Goa never made it past TP Rehenesh. The Jamshedpur goalkeeper was named man-of-the-match. His save to deny Edu Bedia with his feet was the highlight of the game. When he couldn’t reach the ball, the crossbar kept the winners going. Goa saw the ball hit the crossbar three times. Ivan Gonzalez’s close-range header, Anwar Ali’s flick from Bedia’s free kick, again from handshaking distance, and Airam Cabrera’s left footer, all seemed destined for goal, only to hit the upright and bounce back into play. Jamshedpur knew what they were doing all along. Owen Coyle’s side was locked indoors, unable to train due to rising Covid-19 cases inside the bio-secure bubble. Australian striker Jordan Murray is still quarantined, prompting the coach to start with Chima, even though he only had a couple of sessions with the team. The plan was simple -- let Goa have as much of the ball as they want, but when they make a mistake, pounce. Jamshedpur pressed high, and when Chima snatched the ball from a mis-pass, the Nigerian striker could only shoot wide. In the second session, Chima had another look at goal when he chased Laldinliana Renthlei’s overhead ball, and once inside the box launched a powerful shot which goalkeeper Naveen Kumar tried to hold, only to let it slip inside. The error was a major let down for Goa who were desperately trying to grab full points and move closer to the playoff spots. Coach Derrick Pereira made five changes, one forced after Jorge Ortiz picked up a thigh strain during training. He reverted to a back-four with Aiban Dohling as the left-back and handed Brandon Fernandes his first start. Brandon was impressive with the ball at his feet, showing Goa what they had missed all season. But even though the winger returned and impressed, the team’s struggles upfront continued.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/jamshedpur-make-it-three-wins-in-a-row-as-fc-goa-suffer-for-lack-of-sharpness-upfront/articleshow/89188120.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

The road transport ministry on Thursday issued a draft notification for setting the emission and other norms for such retrofitment. Officials said the demand was felt for some time as currently only vehicles complying with the BS-VI emission norms are being sold across the country. As of now vehicles which meet the emission norms of up to BS-IV are allowed for CNG retrofitment. “This is a very positive move by the government as CNG as a fuel will bring huge relief to common people from the high expenditure on petrol. Second, this is a green fuel. Since the government has proposed the retrofitment of CNG kits in vehicles of engine capacity up to 1500 CC, it will cover all cars and also some of the SUVs,” said transport expert Anil Chhikara. He added that the change was necessary considering that it’s mandatory for commercial vehicles plying in Delhi and its suburbs must be on CNG. The ministry, in the draft notification, has said this will be allowed for vehicles that have gross vehicle weight (GVW) of up to 3.5 tonnes and the type approvals for vehicles retrofitted with CNG kits will be valid for three years and such approval will be renewed for every three years at a time. Industry sources said the retrofitment of CNG in such vehicles kits could be around Rs 50,000 per vehicle, but the owners will recover the account quickly due to saving from fuel cost.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/bs-vi-petrol-cars-can-be-fitted-with-cng-kits-soon/articleshow/89188122.cms||Dipak K Dash
---||Business||Real estate sector should be accorded top priority status in budget, say developers||KOLKATA: The real estate sector should be accorded top priority status in the upcoming budget to boost employment and growth of the economy, developers said here on Friday. The construction industry has proven itself a "resilient sector against the pandemic", and is now riding on a positive growth trajectory, they claimed. The sector is expected to reach a market size of $1 trillion by 2030, and will contribute around 13 per cent to the GDP by 2025, a builder said. “The real estate, a resilient sector, should be accorded top priority status in the budget to boost employment and growth of the economy,” Credai West Bengal President Sushil Mohta said. Shristi Infrastructure Development Corporation CMO Abhishek Bhardwaj said there is demand in the industry to redefine affordable housing. "We expect that the government will relook at the definition of affordable housing both from the value of houses and size to provide a much-needed boost to the sector,” he said. Credai appealed to the Centre to enhance the cap of Rs 45 lakh to Rs 1 crore for affordable housing in metro cities. "The Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme benefits should be extended to all segments up to middle-income group II level as it has been extremely helpful for people at large as they are feeling the need for buying their own home. Further tax breaks for organisations building affordable housing will be of great support in these difficult times” Eden Realty managing director Arya Sumant told PTI. Siddha Group managing director Sanjay Jain said developers want the government to help them with a single-window clearance system for affordable housing and projects for people belonging to the middle-income bracket, "which are stuck at the advanced stages of development". Ideal Group managing director Nakul Himmatsingka said, “Relaxation in GST on under-construction projects will help reduce the overall cost burden as it doesn't attract input tax credit. This will encourage sales.” Mohta, who is also Merlin Group chairman, said the budget could focus on "amending Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961 to increase the repayment time limit for housing loan principal".||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/real-estate-sector-should-be-accorded-top-priority-status-in-budget-say-developers/articleshow/89188189.cms||---

The company retailed 11,242 units in 2021, a growth of 42.5 per cent over 7,893 units in 2020. "With stable policies and a clear road map for the sector, an accelerated growth can be achieved transitioning the industry swiftly into the emerging e-mobility era, putting the Indian auto industry on the global map," Mercedes-Benz India managing director and CEO Martin Schwenk said in a statement. The Pune-based automaker also sought changes in the existing taxation structure. "A re-look into the existing taxation structure with a clear focus on the direct tax changes to boost consumption, export promotion, direct job creation and promotion of digitisation is highly desired," Schwenk noted. Continued government spending on infrastructure projects will further propel the demand for both passenger and commercial vehicles, he added. Earlier this month, Schwenk had noted that high prices remain an impediment to the growth of the luxury car segment in India.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-should-aim-long-term-holistic-growth-for-auto-industry-mercedes-benz-india/articleshow/89188255.cms||---

The military said in a brief statement that a hunt was launched after the Kech gunfight and three insurgents were rounded up. “The armed forces are determined to eliminate terrorists from our soil, no matter what the cost,” the army said. Separatist group Balochistan Liberation Front responsibility for the attack and said one of its members died in the clash and the military lost 17 soldiers. The attack followed new militant outfit Baloch Nationalist Army’s (BNA) January 20 bombing in Lahore, Pakistan’s second-largest city, killing three people. The restive southwestern Pakistani province of Balochistan, bordering Iran and Afghanistan, has been recording hundreds of casualties in separatist, sectarian and Islamist violence since 2004. In the past, Pakistan had blamed India for supporting Baloch separatists through the Western-backed government in Afghanistan, before the Taliban took over last year. Police said Friday’s landmine explosion happened in the Mat area of Sui, a sub-district that supplies natural gas to most of Pakistan. Balochistan chief minister Mir Abdul Qudoos Bizenjo said the victims were members of “Aman (peace) Force”. Baloch separatists frequently target security forces, but attacks on pro-government people rarely occur in the volatile province. Sarfraz Bhugti, a senator of the pro-government Balochistan Awami Party, said “Baloch Republican Army terrorists” were behind the attack. The Baloch insurgency started from Dera Bhugti when Nawab Akbar Bhugti, chief of the Bhugti tribe and former governor, asked former army chief and then president Gen. Pervez Musharraf to allow Baloch people to have control over resources in their province. Bhugti was killed in a military offensive. Baloch separatists oppose the over $60bn China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) linking the Chinese province of Xingjian in the north with the strategically important coastal town of Gwadar in Balochistan. The CPEC launched in 2015 consists of rail, road, and energy projects and is part of the wider $1 trillion Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) of China. Militants had targeted Chinese engineers and workers. Thousands of Pakistani troops have been deployed in the region to check violence and protect CPEC projects.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/10-pak-soldiers-die-in-baloch-attack-landmine-blast-kills-4/articleshow/89188304.cms||Omer Farooq Khan
---||Business||Budget: 'Economy needs more hand-holding, fiscal correction can wait'||MUMBAI: Warning that any sudden and sharp fiscal consolidation steps can throttle the nascent and uneven recovery of the Indian economy, a Wall Street brokerage has said the budget should instead focus on boosting overall demand, from rural consumption in particular, and invest more in infrastructure. The successive waves of the pandemic has made it more difficult to reduce government debt as a share of GDP in the medium-term, said Goldman Sachs in a pre-Budget note. It thus pencilled in a gradual fiscal consolidation with FY23 falling by 50 basis points to 6.3 per cent from 6.8 per cent in FY22, and set a target of bringing it down to 4.5 per cent by FY26. The brokerage believes that even though allocation for Covid related expenses will come down, the government will have to continue to focus on welfare spending and also expects capex to increase 12 per cent. But the higher spending will most likely be financed by higher tax revenue in FY23 and deferred asset sales from the current year, helping reduce the deficit. It also sees the general government fiscal deficit falling to 9.3 per cent of GDP in FY23 from 10.1 per cent in FY22 on the back of stronger nominal GDP growth. If the budget removes capital gains tax and withholding tax on foreign bond investments in the country, India will likely be included in the global bond index by Q4 of 2022 and this can help the country attract an additional $30 billion inflows in 2023, which again will lead to lower deficit. Gross tax collections in the first eight months of FY22 rose to 70 per cent of budget estimates which is the highest in the last 10 years. Direct taxes have grown 66 per cent on-year, led by income and corporate tax growth while indirect taxes have grown 39 per cent driven by buoyant GST and excise duties on fuel prices. The report expects gross tax revenue to overshoot budget estimates by about 1.1 per cent of GDP in FY22 and non-tax revenue to be higher by 0.1 per cent of GDP driven by increased dividends from the RBI and higher deferred payments from telcos. The report expects the divestment shortfall to be around 0.6 per cent of GDP and taking all this into consideration, total receipts to be higher by only 20 basis points of GDP in FY22 over budget estimate.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-economy-needs-more-hand-holding-fiscal-correction-can-wait/articleshow/89188324.cms||---

Revenues from operations are up 13% to Rs 2,407 crore from Rs 2,122 crore. The company said in India, the unabated inflation across the consumer basket led to moderation in consumption patterns and the share of wallet of staples, while discretionary and out-of-home categories fared better owing to some degree of pent-up demand. As a result, overall FMCG market volumes witnessed a drop in Q3, with rural visibly lagging urban. Volumes remained flat year-on-year on a very strong base of 15%. The company said 94% of the portfolio logged market share gains and 95% of the portfolio gained penetration on a moving annual total basis. EBITDA margin stood at 17.9%. EBITDA was up 4% YoY and PAT was up 1% YoY.

India proposed the same to Pakistan in a note verbale Friday saying that pilgrims be also allowed to travel by air. The government said Friday it had a positive approach to the issue and was willing to engage Islamabad. India believes an early implementation of the proposal will help both Sikhs and Hindus who are keen to visit pilgrimage centres in Pakistan. The foreign ministry also confirmed Friday India will begin supply of wheat to Afghanistan via Pakistan soon. "As you are aware, under the 1974 Protocol between India and Pakistan, visits to religious shrines are being facilitated regularly. There is an interest on both sides to expand the agreed list of shrines and mode of travel. It naturally needs to be discussed under the Protocol," said MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi. "Let me underline that India has a positive approach on this matter and is willing to engage the Pakistani side," he added. The official also said that, as the pandemic situation normalised, India expected this time to be utilised for discussions under the bilateral Protocol. "It is our hope to facilitate early exchange of visits to all shrines of interest to pilgrims," he said. Both countries have been looking to facilitate visits by pilgrims since the Kartarpur Corridor reopened last year. Pakistan had last month issued visas to 112 Indian pilgrims allowing them to visit a Hindu temple in Pakistan Punjab. Religious tourism and humanitarian issues have kept diplomats on both sides occupied even in the absence of any substantive bilateral engagement between the 2 countries. Visits by pilgrims under the 1974 Protocol have continued despite the occasional disruption like in 2018 when India denied visas to Pakistani pilgrims following the strife over the Kulbhushan Jadhav case.

---||India||Let’s open up more shrines to pilgrims, India proposes to Pakistan||NEW DELHI: Even as bilateral ties with Pakistan remain in deep freeze, India is looking to build on the goodwill created by religious tourism by expanding the agreed list of shrines pilgrims from both sides are allowed to visit. India proposed the same to Pakistan in a note verbale Friday saying that pilgrims be also allowed to travel by air. The government said Friday it had a positive approach to the issue and was willing to engage Islamabad. India believes an early implementation of the proposal will help both Sikhs and Hindus who are keen to visit pilgrimage centres in Pakistan. The foreign ministry also confirmed Friday India will begin supply of wheat to Afghanistan via Pakistan soon. "As you are aware, under the 1974 Protocol between India and Pakistan, visits to religious shrines are being facilitated regularly. There is an interest on both sides to expand the agreed list of shrines and mode of travel. It naturally needs to be discussed under the Protocol," said MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi. "Let me underline that India has a positive approach on this matter and is willing to engage the Pakistani side," he added. The official also said that, as the pandemic situation normalised, India expected this time to be utilised for discussions under the bilateral Protocol. "It is our hope to facilitate early exchange of visits to all shrines of interest to pilgrims," he said. Both countries have been looking to facilitate visits by pilgrims since the Kartarpur Corridor reopened last year. Pakistan had last month issued visas to 112 Indian pilgrims allowing them to visit a Hindu temple in Pakistan Punjab. Religious tourism and humanitarian issues have kept diplomats on both sides occupied even in the absence of any substantive bilateral engagement between the 2 countries. Visits by pilgrims under the 1974 Protocol have continued despite the occasional disruption like in 2018 when India denied visas to Pakistani pilgrims following the strife over the Kulbhushan Jadhav case. A mechanism to facilitate religious tourism was among the 5 agreements that PM Narendra Modi had reached in 2015 with his then counterpart Nawaz Sharif in a bilateral meeting in Russia. India is currently also working with Pakistan to supply wheat to Afghanistan through the Attari-Wagah land route.

---||World||White House gets more time to assess billions in frozen Afghan funds||NEW YORK: A United States judge on Friday gave the Biden administration more time to decide what should be done with about $7 billion of frozen Afghan central bank funds, which some victims of the September 11, 2001, attacks want and which the Taliban claims is theirs. Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn in Manhattan gave the Department of Justice until Feb. 11 to recommend what to do with the funds, which are held at the Federal Reserve Bank in New York.  The funds have been frozen since the Taliban's military takeover in Afghanistan last August. A recommendation on what to do had been expected by Friday.  In a Thursday court filing, the Justice Department requested more time to address the "many complex and important issues" including Sept. 11 victims' claims, diplomacy, and the "still-evolving" situation in Afghanistan.  It said the matters are being fully discussed and "receiving urgent attention at the highest levels of government".  Some 9/11 victims and their families are seeking to cover unsatisfied court judgments related to the attacks, which killed nearly 3,000 people.  One group, the Havlish plaintiffs, won court permission in September to serve the New York Fed a so-called writ of execution to seize the $7 billion and cover an October 2012 court judgment of about the same amount.  The White House also faces pressure from the United Nations and humanitarian aid groups not to apply the funds toward court judgments. They would prefer money be used to shore up Afghanistan's central bank, ease the country's liquidity shortfalls, and help address poverty, hunger and other economic distress.

---||Delhi||Restaurants and bars reopen in Delhi; ‘End other restrictions too,’ plead owners||In a meeting held on Thursday, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) decided to allow restaurants and bars in the city to reopen with 50% seating occupancy. After being shut for dining for almost 15 days due to a surge in COVID cases in the city, the reopening comes as a relief for the hospitality industry that has been fearing temporary closures and loss of jobs during the pandemic. On January 25, the National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI) had also written a letter addressed to the Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, requesting him to lift the restrictions imposed on Delhi restaurants. The news of reopening just two days after that offers some reassurance to the hospitality industry, though owners feel that it’s about time other curbs imposed on them, such as 50% occupancy and restricted timings, are lifted too. ‘If flights can operate at full occupancy, why not restaurants?’Restaurateur Zorawar Kalra says, “We are ecstatic about this news and this comes as a huge relief for our industry, which is among the worst hit. The sector has suffered huge losses with 25% permanent restaurant closures after the second lockdown. As an industry, the safety of our patrons and colleagues is the top priority and we shall fully abide by the 50% occupancy rule, however, if cases remain low, we really hope that even these restrictions are reconsidered as this will play a key role in ensuring the industry’s survival. It is our humble submission that if flights are allowed to run at full occupancy then definitely restaurants, which have a far greater distance between tables, should be allowed the same.” Restaurateur and Delhi chapter head of NRAI, Priyank Sukhija, says that the recent shutdown, which was within a few months of reopening, hugely impacted the restaurant and nightlife business in the Capital. “While the reopening of restaurants and bars for dining is a welcome move, there are cities like Mumbai which didn’t shut restaurants even for a single day. I think it’s high time that restaurants be allowed to operate without restrictions like other businesses,” says Priyank. While restaurateurs welcome the move of reopening restaurants in the National Capital, many are still worried about the night curfew‘Longer operating hours will help generate better revenue’On Thursday, it was also decided that although the weekend lockdown will end in Delhi, the night curfew (from 10pm to 5am) will continue, which is another challenge for restaurateurs. “The night curfews are a big hurdle for us as people work during the day and prefer stepping out late for dinner. Longer operating hours can help with better rotation of tables and will generate some revenue,” says restaurateur Dinesh Arora. Restaurateur Akshay Anand adds, “Our dinner clientele starts visiting around 9.30pm-10pm and by that time, we need to shut down. Dinner hours give us 80 per cent of our revenue and I don’t think we can get that revenue even as we reopen. So, we hope we are allowed to open till our licensed timings.” Satyajit Dhingra, chief regional officer – North of a restaurant chain, says, “Constant closures and rules which curtail us from functioning to our full potential won’t help much. We urge the government to help us with sustainable solutions to allow this industry regain its foothold. While 50 per cent capacity is something that we have been working with, we would also urge the government to re-examine the time restrictions. Allowing us to remain open as per license closing timings will actually reduce overcrowding and will allow us to serve our patrons in a systematic manner.” “To recover from the kind of losses that we have suffered in the last two years, we should be allowed to operate without any restrictions,” adds restaurateur Vikrant Batra. ‘We request the government to support the hospitality sector’Many restaurant have had to shut shop permanently, while others are on the verge of closure, resulting in loss of employment for many. Restaurateurs say that the industry needs urgent support from the government to survive. “After two years of severe losses, we humbly request some form of help from the government, starting with restoration of ITC (input tax credit) as it will help us to keep our heads above water and there can be some hope of recovering the losses,” says restaurateur Zorawar Kalra. Restaurateur Amit Bagga adds, “We hope the government starts recognising the food and beverage industry and gives us some relief, like allowing GST input tax, which will help in encouraging fresh investment and in turn create more jobs.” Read AlsoDelhi weekend curfew off, restaurants & cinemas can open at 50% capWith a steady decline in Covid-19 cases and the positivity rate dropping below 10% for the first time since January 5, Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Thursday eased restrictions in the city, allowing restaurants, bars, cinema halls and theatres to open at 50% capacity.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/restaurants-and-bars-reopen-in-delhi-end-other-restrictions-too-plead-owners/articleshow/89182798.cms||Divya Kaushik
---||World||US warns of war if Russia invades Ukraine||WASHINGTON: The United States on Friday virtually threatened to impose war on Russia if it invaded Ukraine, which Washington considers imminent and Kyiv insists is not. In a joint press conference at the Pentagon with US defense secretary Lloyd Austin, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley urged Russia to stand down, warning "the military capability of Nato is very, very significant". He went to the extent of outlining Nato power, saying the alliance has "approximately 130 brigades, not including US... 93 squadrons of fighters... 4 carriers". While maintaining that "war is not inevitable", he put the onus on de-escalation on Moscow, saying the crisis has been "entirely engineered" by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Milley also said Ukraine's combat capabilities have improved since 2014, with the US providing additional support. If Russia chooses to invade Ukraine, it won't be cost-free in terms of casualties or other significant effects, he warned. Milley and Austin also invoked Article 5 of the Nato charter, which enjoins collective defence for the alliance, of which Ukraine is not yet a member. Austin said Moscow has for months been deploying forces along Ukraine’s border at a “consistent and steady pace”, supported by Russian naval activity in the northern Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea. “We don't believe that President Putin has made a final decision to use these forces against Ukraine. He clearly now has that capability," the US defense secretary added, amid reports of differences between the US and Ukraine over the seriousness of the Russian threat. Earlier, major US news outlets, including CNN, withdrew reports of disagreements between Washington and Kyiv aired during a phone call from President Biden to his Ukrainian counterpart, in which he reportedly warned him that Kyiv could be "sacked" and asked him to “prepare for impact". The report was sourced to a Ukrainian official who reportedly told CNN that the call between the two leaders "did not go well". But the White House pushed back saying Biden said no such thing and the two sides are on the same page. "This is not true. President Biden said that there is a distinct possibility that the Russians could invade Ukraine in February. He has previously said this publicly and we have been warning about this for months. Reports of anything more or different than that are completely false," White House NSC spokesperson Emily Horne said. "Also, no one said "sacked". "The only person who should be sacked is the anonymous source who is circulating an inaccurate portrayal of this conversation," Horne told CNN. A White House readout of the call said, "President Biden reaffirmed the readiness of the United States, along with its allies and partners to respond decisively if Russia further invades Ukraine. He also underscored the commitment of the United States to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity." "President Biden noted the United States has provided Ukraine with over half-a-billion dollars in development and humanitarian assistance in the last year, and is exploring additional macroeconomic support to help Ukraine’s economy amidst pressure resulting from Russia’s military build-up," the White House statement added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-warns-of-war-if-russia-invades-ukraine/articleshow/89188564.cms||Chidanand Rajghatta

---||World||Biden visits collapsed bridge, touts infrastructure law||PITTSBURGH: Arriving just hours after a serious bridge collapse, President Joe Biden stared into the cratered muddy earth where the aging span fell early Friday, striking evidence supporting the $1 trillion infrastructure law he already had planned to tout on his trip to Pittsburgh.  Standing before concrete barriers papered with yellow police tape, Biden craned his neck to look out over the expanse left by the crumbled bridge. He spoke with Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey and first responders at the scene, and was joined by Sen. Bob Casey, Rep. Conor Lamb and Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman.  "The idea that we've been so far behind on infrastructure for so many years, it's mind boggling," Biden said.  As for the rest of the nation's aging bridges, he pledged, "We're gonna fix them all."  The bridge collapse, which caused no fatalities but prompted rescuers to form a human chain to retrieve people from a precariously perched bus, offered Biden a striking example of what he has declared is an urgent need for investments in the country's infrastructure.  The steel span was built in 1970, and a 2019 inspection revealed the deck and superstructure to be in poor condition, according to the US department of transportation's National Bridge Inventory.  The infrastructure law signed by Biden has earmarked about $1.6 billion for Pennsylvania bridge maintenance, with tens of billions more for public transit, highway maintenance and broadband internet expansion in the state.  During his visit, Biden was to tour a manufacturing research and development center before delivering remarks promoting economic progress during his first year in office and the investments his administration has helped foster in American manufacturing jobs. He was also expected to call on Congress to pass new legislation aimed at increasing US competitiveness with China and invest billions to support supply chain resilience and semiconductor chip research and manufacturing.  Friday's trip was an opening step in a broader campaign to promote White House achievements in key states before the midterm elections. It brought Biden, a Pennsylvania native, home to one of the top-targeted states this cycle. The Pennsylvania battle to replace Republican Sen. Pat Toomey, who is not seeking reelection, is expected to be one of the most competitive Senate races this year.  But at least one of the three leading Democrats on Pennsylvania's statewide ballot this spring who were invited to appear with Biden were not attending, their campaigns confirmed on the eve of the president's visit.  State Attorney General Josh Shapiro, the likely Democratic nominee in the race for governor, will be absent because of scheduling conflicts, according to his spokesperson. Fetterman, a leading Senate candidate, originally had no plans to attend but appeared with Biden at the site of the bridge collapse.  The high-profile absence comes as Democrats in other states have begun taking modest steps to distance themselves from the first-term president, whose approval ratings have fallen sharply in recent months. And while Fetterman and Shapiro indicated that politics had no bearing on their schedules, their decisions to avoid Biden, particularly in his home state, could fuel further questions among anxious Democratic candidates elsewhere as they decide whether to embrace the struggling president.  Earlier in the month, Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams, a leading candidate for governor in another swing state, skipped a chance to appear with the president in the state, citing an unspecified scheduling conflict. Last week, Texas Democrat Beto O'Rourke said he didn't need the Democratic president's assistance in his campaign for governor.  The White House announced Biden's trip on Monday after the president said last week he would look to get out of Washington more in the second year of his presidency.  Biden, who has seen his poll numbers sink in the midst of an unrelenting pandemic and high inflation, said it was important that he "go out and talk to the public" about what he's accomplished and about why Congress needs to get behind the rest of his domestic agenda.  While in Pittsburgh, Biden will focus on the economy, according to White House press secretary Jen Psaki.  "He'll be talking about how far we've come in getting our economy moving again, making more right here in America, and ensuring all workers benefit," Psaki told reporters at the White House on Thursday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biden-visits-collapsed-bridge-touts-infrastructure-law/articleshow/89188708.cms||---
---||India||Don’t blindly follow West in criminalising marital rape: Govt||NEW DELHI: Opposing the PILs related to “marital rape”, the Centre has told the Delhi high court that, among other things, misuse of Section 498 of the IPC related to dowry harassment and lack of a mechanism to verify when consent stands withdrawn by the wife are concerns because of which India should move cautiously and not follow other countries blindly on the issue. This has been conveyed to the court in a written submission. “Various other countries, mostly Western, have criminalised marital rape but it does not necessarily mean India should also follow them blindly. This country has its own unique problems due to various factors like literacy, lack of financial empowerment of a majority of females, mindset of society, vast diversity, poverty, etc and these should be considered carefully before criminalising marital rape,” the government submitted earlier this month. It has pointed out that marital rape is not defined in any statute or law. While rape is defined under Section 375 of IPC, “defining marital rape would call for a broad-based consensus in society. As to what constitutes marital rape and what would not constitute marital rape needs to be defined precisely before a view on its criminalisation is taken,” it said. On the evidence in such cases, the government has argued that at present the testimony of the prosecutrix is sufficient to convict the accused under Section 376 of IPC. “The medical evidence indicates injuries, marks or coloration etc of the body, in particular on the back or chest or private parts, that can certainly provide ample corroboration. But this corroborative evidence may be rendered useless in case of allegations of marital rape. It will be difficult to determine as to when the consent was withdrawn by the married woman. The cost of the circumstantial and corroborative evidence will become futile in case of marital rape,” the Centre has said. The Centre is yet to argue in the court, which has repeatedly, including on Friday, asked when it can expect to hear its stand. Last week, solicitor general Tushar Mehta had told the HC that the Centre was considering a “constructive approach” to the issue and has sought suggestions from several stakeholders and authorities on comprehensive amendments to the criminal law. He had said criminalisation of marital rape involves “family issues” as well as the dignity of a woman and cannot be looked at from a “microscopic angle” and sought some more time. But the bench made it clear it would continue hearing other stakeholders till the Centre opens its arguments. In its written submission, the government has maintained that marital rape is sufficiently covered under “sexual abuse” under the definition of domestic violence. The offence as well as adequate remedies have been provided for under the Act. Furthermore, any act of unnatural sex between a man and his wife are also covered under Section 377 of IPC, the note highlights. Citing the misuse of Section 498A of IPC, the Centre has said apprehensions “of gross misuse of the offence of marital rape by the wife cannot be ruled out”. It has contended that adequate procedural safeguards will have to be put in place “which can only be done by the legislature in case it seeks to make marital rape an offence”. Elaborating further, it underlined that “deletion of exception 2 of Section 375 would make marital rape a cognisable, non-bailable and non-compoundable offence. This would stop all the chances of a settlement between the husband and wife which is possible under Section 498A of IPC.” The Centre has also contended that a court “cannot usurp the power of the legislature”, adding that removal of exception 2 of Section 375 IPC “would be akin to legislating a separate offence which can be done only by the legislature as per the doctrine of separation of powers prescribed in the Constitution of India.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dont-blindly-follow-west-in-criminalising-marital-rape-govt/articleshow/89188920.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||India||Supreme Court revokes 1-year suspension of 12 Maharashtra BJP MLAs||NEW DELHI: Holding that suspension of a member from any assembly beyond one session is grossly violative of “basic democratic values” and worse than expulsion, the Supreme Court Friday held the July 2021 resolution passed by the Maharashtra assembly to suspend 12 BJP MLAs for allegedly misbehaving with the presiding officer of the House as “unconstitutional, grossly illegal and irrational” as the period of suspension extended beyond the remainder of the session concerned. In a judgment running to 90-pages, a bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and C T Ravikumar said legislatures should use suspension as a measure to discipline unruly members in a graded way: starting with barring the member from participation for remainder of the day and, in case of repeat offence, eviction for the rest of the session. Suspension cannot be used as a punitive measure to keep the member out of the House beyond one session, the bench held in an order which will start a fresh debate on whether conduct of proceedings of legislatures can be subjected to judicial scrutiny. The bench, however, was unambiguous that the suspension of 12 BJP MLAs for a year was undemocratic. "Suspension beyond the remainder period of the ongoing session would not only be grossly irrational measure, but also violative of basic democratic values owing to unessential deprivation of the member concerned and more importantly, the constituency would remain unrepresented in the assembly. It would also impact the democratic set-up as a whole by permitting the thin majority of the government (coalition government) of the day to manipulate the numbers of the opposition party in the House in an undemocratic manner," said Justice Khanwilkar who penned the judgment for the bench. "Suffice it to observe that one-year suspension is worse than ‘expulsion’, ‘disqualification’ or ‘resignation’ insofar as the right of the constituency to be represented before the House/Assembly is concerned. In that, long suspension is bound to affect the rights harsher than expulsion wherein a mid-term election is held within the specified time in terms of Section 151A of the 1951 Act, not later than six months. Thus, the impugned resolution is unreasonable, irrational, and arbitrary and liable to be set aside," said the bench. "Resultantly, we have no hesitation in concluding that the impugned resolution suffers from the vice of being unconstitutional, grossly illegal and irrational to the extent of period of suspension beyond the remainder of the concerned (ongoing) session," it said. The court noted that punitive acts of indefinite suspension of members of the opposition will act as a fetter on their effective participation in the proceedings as they would always be wary of the risk of getting barred for a long period. "There would be no purposeful or meaningful debates but one as per the whims of the majority. That would not be healthy for democracy as a whole," it said. The bench agreed with Senior Advocate Mahesh Jethmalani, the leading counsel on behalf of BJP MLAs, who contended that the resolution dated July 5 was passed in undue haste and was arbitrary. He said it was politically motivated, primarily intended to adversely impact the numbers of the opposition party in the House. The notice was also issued to Maharashtra Assembly but it chose not to appear, and it was the Maharashtra government which unsuccessfully tried to defend the resolution. The order comes in the wake of a controversy over the suspension of a group of opposition members of Rajya Sabha on grounds of indiscipline on Juily 5, 2021. Although the members concerned were suspended only for a session, their punishment kicked in during the session which followed the one in which the misconduct had happened. The court ruled that the suspension of a member must be preferred as a short-term or temporary measure for restoring order in the functioning of the assembly session concerned for completing its scheduled business within time and by way of disciplinary measure against the incorrigible member(s). "Thus, the suspension may be resorted to merely for ensuring orderly conduct of the business of the House during the session concerned. Anything in excess of that would be irrational suspension. This is so because the member represents the constituency from where he has been duly elected and longer suspension would entail in deprivation of the constituency to be represented in the House. It is true that right to vote and be represented is integral to our democratic process and it is not an absolute right. Indeed, the constituency cannot have any right to be represented by a disqualified or expelled member. However, their representative cannot be kept away from the House in the guise of suspension beyond the necessary (rational) period linked to the ongoing assembly session," it said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-revokes-1-year-suspension-of-12-maharashtra-bjp-mlas/articleshow/89188976.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

The deal with Airtel will be funded out of Google’s $10 billion India Digitisation Fund and see the company invest $700 million for a 1.2% share in Airtel at a price of Rs 734 per share (it closed the day at Rs 717 on the Bombay Stock Exchange on Friday). The remaining $300 million will be spent on areas such as development of affordable smartphones, as well as accelerating digital inclusion, including network domain use cases for 5G and growth of cloud. TOI was the first to report on Google’s plans to make financial investments into Airtel in its editions dated August 28 last year. While the investments into Jio Platforms had come at a valuation of $58.1 billion (Rs 4.36 lakh crore) for the Ambani company, the Airtel funding comes at a valuation of $54.7 billion (Rs 4.1 lakh crore). Airtel and Mittal will look to ride the partnership with Google to gain valuable insights around development of affordable smartphones -- something that had helped Jio in the creation of JioPhone Next -- apart from strengthening their foray into 5G. Airtel said Google’s partnership with Jio Platforms, where it also got a board position, is not in conflict with any deal. Sunil Bharti Mittal, chairman of Bharti Airtel, said the companies have a vision to grow India’s digital dividend through innovative products. “With our future-ready network, digital platforms, last-mile distribution and payments ecosystem, we look forward to working closely with Google to increase the depth and breadth of India’s digital ecosystem,” he said. Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet, said the companies have a “shared vision” to expand connectivity and ensuring equitable access to the internet for more Indians. “Our commercial and equity investment in Airtel is a continuation of our Google for India Digitisation Fund’s efforts to increase access to smartphones, enhance connectivity to support new business models and help companies on their digital transformation journey,” Pichai said. Under the larger ‘strategic goals’ of the partnership, both companies will look to co-create India-specific network domain use cases for 5G and other standards with cutting-edge implementations. Airtel already uses Google’s 5G-ready Evolved Packet Core & Software Defined Network platforms and plans to explore scaling up the deployment of Google’s network virtualisation solutions to deliver a superior network experience to its customers. The companies will also focus on shaping and growing the cloud ecosystem in India to accelerate their digital transformation journeys. Airtel serves more than one million small and medium businesses with its enterprise connectivity offering, and this partnership is likely to help accelerate digital adoption. Prashant Singhal, the telecom leader at Ernst & Young India, said apart from playing out in India, the partnership also has the potential to positively impact Airtel’s operations across Africa. “There will be multiplier effects. We feel that Google’s keen focus on India is a great confidence booster for the local industry, and also for Airtel. The partnership will help in getting 5G use cases faster in the market, apart from development of affordable devices and cloud infrastructure.” Asked whether Airtel will continue to offer cloud services of other operators such as AWS and Oracle, Airtel CEO Gopal Vittal said the Google partnership is not exclusive in nature: “We will continue to work with multiple partners. There is no exclusivity for either of the partners.” He said Airtel will continue to make investments into network expansion and other business areas, such as home broadband, data centres and 5G networks. “We are investing about $2.5 billion annually, and these will continue.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/after-jio-deal-google-to-invest-1-billion-in-airtel-now/articleshow/89189150.cms||Pankaj Doval

It is the fanatic who is the root cause of all problems to divide people in the name of religion (sic),” Madras high court said on Friday, refusing to stall the removal of a temple standing on public land. “The petitioner, in the garb of setting up a temple, cannot usurp highway property, which is meant for public use irrespective of creed, caste and religion,” a division bench comprising Justices S Vaidyanathan and D Bharatha Chakravarthy said. “If the petitioner is so particular in facilitating devotees to worship Vinayagar, it is open for him either to allot his unencumbered land or the land, if any, available to the temple, and thereafter shift the idol to that place,” the judges said. The court passed the order on a plea moved by S Periyasamy seeking to quash a notice issued by the state highways department for the removal of a temple in Veppanthattai, in Tamil Nadu’s Perambalur district. The petitioner, a trustee of the temple, said the mandir had existed for more than three decades and was constructed without causing any obstruction to the free flow of the public and transport. Refusing to accept the same, the court said, “Even though the petitioner has stated that the temple was constructed three decades ago and the land belonged to the temple, what prevented him from producing necessary documents to establish his case?” The submission that the temple has not caused any hindrance to the public or free flow of traffic all along and is used purely for the purpose of worship cannot be accepted for the reason that, firstly, the petitioner has failed miserably to produce documents to prove that the land is under the control of the trust, the judges said. This apart, if the submission of the petitioner is accepted, then everyone will encroach upon public land and come with the plea that there is no obstruction to any public and, therefore, they should be permitted to continue their illegal occupation, the court added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/temple-cant-usurp-land-god-is-omnipresent-says-madras-high-court/articleshow/89189192.cms||Suresh Kumar
---||Business||Air India takes off on long haul to revival||NEW DELHI: Air India flights started operating under the Tata banner from Friday after nearly seven decades. Getting the most suitable buyer means the debt-laden airline has avoided a shutdown like Kingfisher or Jet Airways. But what does it mean for passengers? This TOI reporter took a Friday morning Delhi-Mumbai flight to find that out and ended up realising why most great romantic movies usually end with the lovelorn couple tying the knot after much trouble. Because the realities dawn subsequently and success lies in making the tie-up work. In AI’s case too, the euphoria — rather relief — of Tatas taking over the airline gave way to a reality check while preparing to travel on AI 665 late on Thursday night. The ticket purchased via a leading travel portal did not mention the terminal to go to at Delhi Airport. While the AI website mentions that clearly in flight details, Tatas must ensure the same is reflected on tickets purchased from all channels. Read AlsoAir India selloff needed for nation’s good: ScindiaNEW DELHI: After their “ill-fated” merger in 2007, erstwhile Air India and Indian Airlines lost Rs 83,000 crore. In the 14 years since then, successive governments pumped in Rs 55,000 crore as equity and gave guarantee of Rs 50,000 crore. Combined with debt and other liabilities, said aviationOn reaching T3 at 5.45 am for the 8 am flight, there was no sign of the night-before-change-of-ownership till boarding a 12-year-old Airbus A321 (VT-PPX) around 7.20 am. A struggle to survive in the past few years meant AI had no funds for the upkeep of its now-ageing aircraft interiors. Lumbar support for back cushion is poor. Covers on seat tops are meant to hide non-functional back-of-seat inflight entertainment screens. Clearly, hardware in terms of fleet and/or cabin upgrade will take lot of investment and time. The change of ownership started becoming visible in the “software” — the human aspect. Aircraft doors were closed on time. Captain Varun Khandelwal’s pre-departure welcome inflight announcement was about the “aitihasik… flight into the future of AI” (as a Tata Group airline). Soon after an on-time takeoff, polite cabin crew started serving meals to the about 50 passengers onboard as the 182-seater-A321 given low flyer numbers during Omicron. Perhaps AI 665 hadn’t made it to the list of flights that are supposed to get an enhanced meal service on a staggered basis. The serving was the old but generous — bun, muffin, strawberry yogurt, hot idly-upma in sambar and tea/coffee apart from accompanying condiments. The hostess happily gave another bun and butter which was among the more delectable items on the tray. Captain Khandelwal gave a detailed enroute briefing on which city we were passing by (Indore), the cabin temperature (25 degrees Celsius) and speed (0.77 mach). He and First Officer Dipali Pratape emphasised on the flight taking off five minutes before time in Delhi and an earlier than scheduled arrival in Mumbai. Clearly, the $100-billion salt-to-satellite conglomerate Tatas realises the uphill, capital intensive and long drawn task ahead in terms of reviving the airline both financially for itself (daily losses Rs 20 crore) and comfort-wise for passengers. That’s why they have not raised expectations by creating a hype and opting for a trademark low key takeover. Tata Group company Taj Hotels around 1970 took over the dilapidated 1747-era Jag Mahal in Udaipur. It recently celebrated 50 years of running this as the famed Lake Palace. Indian travellers really hope Tata’s Talace can repeat the act with the Maharaja's kingdom by transforming it into a profitable and comfortable entity.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/air-india-takes-off-on-long-haul-to-revival/articleshow/89189265.cms||Saurabh Sinha

After more than a century, there has been no improvement and still the decree holder faces the same problem what was being faced in the past,” a bench of Justices Ajay Rastogi and Abhay S Oka said. The bench passed the observation while adjudicating a corporate battle between two companies for execution of a decree passed by a foreign court in 2006 but whose execution petition is still pending. “A litigant coming to court seeking relief is not interested in receiving a paper decree when he succeeds in establishing his case. What he primarily wants from the court of justice is the relief and if it is a money decree, he wants that money what he is entitled for in terms of the decree, must be satisfied by the judgment debtor at the earliest possible without fail keeping in view the reasonable restrictions/rights which are available to the judgment debtor under the provisions of the statute or the code, as the case may be,” the bench said. The court said the instant case is a live illustration before us where the decree holder was able to get a money decree of a foreign court way back on February 7, 2006 and even though 16 years have rolled by, it is still not clear as to which is the forum where he could approach for execution of a decree. The issue before the bench was whether the High Court of Delhi is a competent court to entertain a petition for executing a money decree, which the court answered in affirmative.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nothing-has-changed-since-1872-decrees-tough-to-execute-says-supreme-court/articleshow/89189293.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary
---||India||Legislators’ House conduct draws Supreme Court’s disapproval||NEW DELHI: With scenes of unruly behaviour in the House by members of legislative bodies, including Parliament, becoming frequent in recent times, the Supreme Court on Friday expressed deep concern over the deterioration as most of the time is spent “in jeering and personal attacks against each other instead of erudite constructive and educative debates consistent with the highest tradition of the august body”. Terming the legislature as the first place where justice is dispensed to the common man by a democratic process, a bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and C T Ravikumar appealed to all stakeholders to take steps to restore the lost glory of the legislative bodies which used to be a forum for intellectual debates of the highest order. It said the legacy should become more prominent than the rumpus caused very often and elected members should display statesmanship and not brinkmanship inside the house. “It is in public domain (through print, electronic and social media) that the members of the Parliament or assembly/council of the state, spend much of the time in a hostile atmosphere. The Parliament/Legislative Assembly (are becoming) more and more intransigent place. The philosophical tenet, one must agree to disagree is becoming a seldom scene or a rarity during the debates. It has become common to hear that the House could not complete its usual scheduled business and most of the time had been spent in jeering and personal attacks against each other instead of erudite constructive and educative debates. It is disheartening for the observers,” it said. “They earnestly feel that it is high time that corrective steps are taken by all concerned and the elected representatives would do enough to restore the glory and the standard of intellectual debates of the highest order,” the bench added. The court expressed the concern while passing order against the Maharashtra assembly resolution suspending 12 BJP MLAs for one year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/legislators-house-conduct-draws-supreme-courts-disapproval/articleshow/89189343.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary
---||India||Can’t extern individual on mere suspicion, says Supreme Court||NEW DELHI: In a major order upholding personal liberties, the Supreme Court on Friday said that police and competent authorities in a state cannot on suspicion or mechanically order externment of a person without sufficient material as it violates the externed person's right to move freely, stay with his family and carry on with his professional work from home-town. Quashing the order of the competent authority in Maharashtra directing one Deepak Dongre to remove himself from Jalna district, allegedly at the behest of his maternal uncle and Badnapur MLA Narayan Kuche, a bench of Justices Ajay Rastogi and Abhay S Oka said, "There cannot be any manner of doubt that an order of externment is an extraordinary measure. The effect of the order of externment is of depriving a citizen of his fundamental right of free movement throughout the territory of India. In practical terms, such an order prevents the person even from staying in his own house along with his family members during the period for which this order is in subsistence. In a given case, such an order may deprive the person of his livelihood." "It thus follows that recourse should be taken to Section 56 of Maharashtra Police Act, 1951, very sparingly keeping in mind that it is an extraordinary measure. For invoking Section 56(a)(1), there must be objective material on record on the basis of which the competent authority must record its subjective satisfaction that the movements or acts of any person are causing or calculated to cause alarm, danger or harm to persons or property," the bench said. Writing the judgment, Justice Oka said whenever the competent authority passes an externment order for the maximum period of two years under the Act, the decision must disclose a complete application of mind and the competent authority must record its subjective satisfaction for resorting to the maximum period provided for externment of a person. Petitioner's counsel sandeep S Deshmukh said that the police, after having failed to keep Dongre under arrest because the magistrate granted bail to him in a freshly foisted case, resorted to seven year-old cases which are pending trial at the behest of MLA Narayan Kuche and passed the externment order. Deshmukh also pointed out that in one of the foisted cases the complainant had told the court how she had complained against Dongre to police at the behest of the MLA. The bench said, "The Judicial Magistrate rejected the proposal to keep the appellant in detention for 15 days. There is nothing placed on record to show that the said order was challenged by the police. After having failed to satisfy the learned Judicial Magistrate about the necessity of detaining the appellant for 15 days, the Sub-Divisional Police Officer initiated action of externment against him by issuing a show-cause notice on July 7, 2020. It is not the case made out in the show cause notice of July 7, 2020 that after release of Dongre on June 2, 2020, he indulged in the commission of any offence or any other objectionable activity." Justices Rastogi and Oka said, "Careful perusal of the December 15, 2020 externment order does not disclose any application of mind (by competent authority). It does not record the subjective satisfaction of the authority on the basis of material on record that the order of externment should be for the maximum period of two years. If the order of externment for the maximum permissible period of two years is passed without recording subjective satisfaction regarding the necessity of extending the order of externment to the maximum permissible period, it will amount to imposing unreasonable restrictions on the fundamental right guaranteed under clause (d) of Article 19(1) of the Constitution of India."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cant-extern-individual-on-mere-suspicion-says-supreme-court/articleshow/89189370.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

It, however, refrained from providing any yardstick to decide inadequate representation and left it for governments to take a call. A bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao, Sanjiv Khanna and B R Gavai held that the entire service or class of services cannot be taken to be a unit and treated as a cadre for the purpose of collection of quantifiable data for providing reservation in promotions. "Before providing for reservation in promotions to a cadre, the state is obligated to collect quantifiable data regarding inadequacy of representation of SCs and STs. Collection of information regarding inadequacy of representation of SCs and STs cannot be with reference to the entire service or ‘class’/‘group’ but it should be relatable to the grade/category of posts to which promotion is sought. Cadre, which should be the unit for the purpose of collection of quantifiable data in relation to the promotional post(s), would be meaningless if data pertaining to representation of SCs and STs is with reference to the entire service," it said. It said that the state should justify reservation in promotions with respect to the cadre to which promotion is made. "Taking into account the data pertaining to a 'group’, which would be an amalgamation of certain cadres in a service, would not give the correct picture of the inadequacy of representation of SCs and STs in the cadre in relation to which reservation in promotions is sought to be made," the bench said. The main stumbling block for the state to grant reservation in promotion is lack of adequate data on representation of SCs/STs in different cadres. As per the Centre, there are over 5000 cadres in central government jobs in 90 ministries/departments in which 30 lakh employees are working. Referring to information received from 44 ministries/departments out of the 90, the Centre has stated that there are around 3800 cadres and submitted before the court that it had data on representation of SCs/STs in different classes of jobs--Class I, II, II and IV and it was difficult to collect data cadre-wise. It had submitted that adequacy of representation differs in different classes of employment with a higher percentage in Class III and Class IV, but very low in Class I.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cadre-wise-data-must-for-sc-st-promotion-quotas-says-supreme-court/articleshow/89189403.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

Several measures have been taken to strengthen the National Cadet Corps in India, which includes 90 universities having started NCC as an “elective subject” under the new National Education Policy, the PM said. While one lakh new cadets have been enrolled in the border areas in the last two years, a panel for a comprehensive review of the NCC has also been set up to make it more relevant for the changing times. Addressing the Republic Day NCC camp, Modi said, “The training that I got in NCC has given me immense strength in discharging my responsibilities.” Modi wore a Sikh NCC cadet’s turban for the rally, two days after he donned a Brahmakamal cap from Uttarkhand and a stole from Manipur — also poll-bound states — during the parade. He dwelt upon the steps being taken to open the doors of the armed forces for women. “Country needs your contribution...,” he told the girl cadets. The “daughters of the country” are taking admission in Sainik Schools and are getting major responsibilities in the Army, while they are also flying fighter jets. “...it should be our endeavour that more daughters should be included in NCC,” the PM added. He underlined the major role that the youth can play in the ‘vocal for local’ campaign. “If today’s youth resolves to use only those goods that have been created with the labour and sweat of an Indian, India’s destiny can be transformed,” he said. NCC cadets should also run an awareness campaign about the “dangers of misinformation” in this digital age, he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/spirit-of-nation-first-modis-mantra-for-youth-at-ncc-rally/articleshow/89189449.cms||---

This was decided at a virtual meeting of the Congress’ parliamentary strategy group on Friday which was chaired by Congress president Sonia Gandhi, where she laid emphasis on the need for close coordination and cooperation with opposition parties in Parliament. During the winter session, while parties like the TRS had joined forces with the Congress over select issues, TMC had distanced itself from several joint discussions on opposition strategy. This time, it is expected that elections to five states assemblies, including the crucial states of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, aside from Punjab, Goa and Manipur, will keep parties and their leaders preoccupied. At Friday’s meeting, Congress leaders from both Houses unanimously backed key issues presented in the meeting by leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge. These included rising inflation and the privatisation of India’s national carrier, Air India.

This day too shall be registered in the history of Samajwadi struggle. We are on the flight to a historic win.” Sources at the Delhi airport said there was no “mischief”. An officer said, “Akhilesh was supposed to go to Muzaffarnagar for a rally...Republic Day flight restrictions are on. Due to this, once air traffic resumed on Friday, priority was given to scheduled commercial flights. The chopper in question was in queue to take off. During the wait, it ran low on fuel and had to return for refueling. Due to these factors, it took off at 3 pm instead of 2 pm. There was no foul play.” After he arrived in Muzaffarnagar, Akhilesh said, “The time has come for BJP’s exodus (from UP).” Chaudhary by his side, Akhilesh brushed aside overtures made by Amit Shah in Delhi, where the home minister met Jat leaders from western UP, to Chaudhary when he said the latter was ‘most welcome to join even after polls”, Akhilesh said, “Who is accepting their invitation? See their condition now. They are compelled to extend such invitations. Jayantji has closed the doors on them. BJP is certainly headed for a political exodus.” To Shah’s message to RLD, Chaudhary had earlier said he was “not a coin” to flip sides so easily. Asked why no Muslim candidate was given a ticket by the SP-RLD alliance in Muzaffarnagar, where the community has a substantial presence, Akhilesh said, “It’s not important who gets the ticket.

---||India||Chopper delayed in Delhi, Akhilesh Yadav sniffs conspiracy||MUZAFFARNAGAR/MEERUT: Alleging “foul play and conspiracy” after it took three hours for SP chief Akhilesh Yadav to take off in his chopper from Delhi en route to Muzaffarnagar where he was scheduled to address a meeting with ally Jayant Chaudhary of RLD, the ex-UP CM tweeted: “Abuse of power is a sign of the defeated. This day too shall be registered in the history of Samajwadi struggle. We are on the flight to a historic win.” Sources at the Delhi airport said there was no “mischief”. An officer said, “Akhilesh was supposed to go to Muzaffarnagar for a rally...Republic Day flight restrictions are on. Due to this, once air traffic resumed on Friday, priority was given to scheduled commercial flights. The chopper in question was in queue to take off. During the wait, it ran low on fuel and had to return for refueling. Due to these factors, it took off at 3 pm instead of 2 pm. There was no foul play.” After he arrived in Muzaffarnagar, Akhilesh said, “The time has come for BJP’s exodus (from UP).” Chaudhary by his side, Akhilesh brushed aside overtures made by Amit Shah in Delhi, where the home minister met Jat leaders from western UP, to Chaudhary when he said the latter was ‘most welcome to join even after polls”, Akhilesh said, “Who is accepting their invitation? See their condition now. They are compelled to extend such invitations. Jayantji has closed the doors on them. BJP is certainly headed for a political exodus.” To Shah’s message to RLD, Chaudhary had earlier said he was “not a coin” to flip sides so easily. Asked why no Muslim candidate was given a ticket by the SP-RLD alliance in Muzaffarnagar, where the community has a substantial presence, Akhilesh said, “It’s not important who gets the ticket. Our focus is to work for the benefit of society and farmers.” On the recent tussle for tickets and seats between the SP and RLD, Akhilesh said, “It is true there are so many aspirants for tickets and when someone does not get it there is protest.

Unvaccinated should get vaccinated, rather than shifting focus on booster shots. It can be reserved for a future emergency,” said Dr Mulayil. He said a third dose for all would not help in preventing the spread of the Omicron. “One is not sure about the future variants and if these boosters will be helpful for all of them,”he said. NTAGI for Covid-19 and the WHO had a high-level meet on Tuesday, where the issue of boosters was discussed in detail. “Boosters have not helped the cases in any country that has administered the third dose. Besides, we shall not blindly follow what other countries have done. We have to look at our local epidemiology and science, and our decisions have to be based on that assessment,” a senior health official had told TOI. However, “precaution doses” would continue to be administered to healthcare workers and those above 60 years with comorbidities under the government’s national immunisation programme as per the existing policy, the official said.  Well-known epidemiologist Dr Chandrakant Lahariya told TOI that currently the country did not need to be in a hurry for booster doses for the entire adult population. “With rising infection of the Omicron variant, a large section of the population has got the infection. It has resulted in additional protection definitely and so, there is no hurry to administer the third dose at all,” he said. Dr Lahariya said there was not enough data to understand if the third dose of vaccines being used in India had additional benefit in the current scenario. “Those affected by Omicron can very well wait for their shot,” he said. Leading virologist and NTAGI member Dr Gagandeep Kang told TOI that older individuals and those with comorbidities who had not been infected would need boosters.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/covid-19-boosters-will-be-untimely-now-says-expert/articleshow/89189671.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Appearing for SFIO, solicitor general Tushar Mehta requested Chief Justice N V Ramana that even though the SC in a recent order had said that the SFIO investigation was a continuous one and would spill beyond the three month stipulation under the Companies Act for completion of the probe, the HC had erroneously relied on the same Act to stall the probe into the nine Sahara entities going on since November 2018 and with a deadline for completion by March 31 this year. The CJI said he would look into the papers and assign a date for hearing. In its special leave petition against the HC’s interim order of December 13, the SFIO said the Registrar of Companies had received a large number of complaints from investors about non-payment of their investment proceeds even after maturity. RoC, Mumbai, inquired into the complaints and in a report of August 14, 2018 had recommended to the Union government to initiate investigations into affairs of Sahara Q Shop Unique Products Range Ltd, Sahara Q Gold Mart Ltd and Sahara Housing Investment Corporation. On October 31, 2018, the ministry of corporate affairs had assigned the probe to SFIO, which during the investigations found that Sahara India Commercial Corporation Ltd, Sahara India Financial Corporation Ltd and Sahara India Real Estate Corporation Ltd had collected Rs 14,100 crore, Rs 17,500 crore, and Rs 19,400 crore from public under the guise of different schemes promising higher returns to investors. “But, investors were not paid the maturity amount and were forced to convert their deposits into then prevailing schemes of other group entities/companies,” it said and alleged that apart from these six, three other group companies — Aamby Valley Ltd, Qing Aamby City Developers Corporation Ltd and Sahara Prime City Ltd — were also involved in the fraud. SFIO said all the nine companies were intertwined and the investigations revealed huge inter-company investments/advances. On October 27, 2020, the six other companies found involved in the alleged fraud were also placed under SFIO probe by the ministry of corporate affairs. SFIO said, “There are huge funds movement to and from these nine companies from and to the promoters/directors and to other entities of Sahara group, which is suspected to be siphoning off/diversion of public money.” It said the HC erroneously stayed the operation of the two orders — October 31, 2018 and October 27, 2020 — for SFIO probe against the nine Sahara group companies on the erroneous application of Section 212(3) of the Companies Act which mandated completion of the probe within three months. SFIO cited the Supreme Court’s 2019 judgment in the Rahul Modi case to counter the HC’s interim restraint order and said that the ministry has extended the timeline for completion of the probe till March 31, 2022.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sahara-companies-raised-rs-50000-crore-did-not-pay-back-investors-sfio/articleshow/89189432.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Botlab Dynamics, led by IIT alumni, was given an initial seed fund of Rs 1 crore for R&D and, subsequently, Rs 2.5 crore for scale-up and commercialisation by the science & technology ministry’s technology development board for the first-of-its-kind technological project in the country. Union S&T minister Jitendra Singh, who met the engineers and team members of Botlab at his residence on Friday, said India would become the fourth country after China, Russia and the UK to carry out such a large-scale show. Singh said he was proud that the technology was developed within the country and all necessary components, both hardware and software such as flight controller, precision GPS, motor controller and ground control station algorithms, were indigenous. The minister said Botlab, in association with the defence ministry, had conceptualised the novel show to commemorate the 75th year of Independence. The 10-minute show, he said, will showcase government achievements through creative formations in the sky. He reiterated the government’s commitment to support more such innovative and sustainable startups to fulfil PM Modi’s vision of making India a global hub of the startup ecosystem. Subir Kumar Saha, a professor in the mechanical engineering department of IIT Delhi and project director of its Technology Innovation Hub, told TOI, “Till last year, the team members could manage to hold a demo with just 50-100 drones. When the defence ministry came up with the proposal to perform a demo with 1,000 drones for Beating Retreat, the team took up the challenge and is now ready to perform.” Dr Sarita Ahlawat, co-founder and MD of Botlab, said the project, “Design and Development of a Reconfigurable Swarming System Consisting of 500-1,000 Drones for 3D Choreographed Drone Light Shows”, could become successful only due to the full financial support of the department as the private sector was reluctant to hand-hold the startup. She also thanked project engineers for letting go lucrative MNC offers and owning up the idea. In 2016, Botlab Dynamics was incorporated at IIT’s technology business incubator unit. Till now, it has provided eight drones to Delhi Police, sold a heavy-lift system to Indian Agriculture Research Institute, and held drone demos for the Indian Army. In 2018, the startup got selected by Army Design Bureau (ADB) for a demo of the heavy-lift drone at Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh and in 2019, Botlab demonstrated a swarm of 10 drones with obstacle avoidance capability for the Indian Army at NorTech in J&K’s Udhampur.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/beating-retreat-iit-alumni-startup-behind-1000-drone-show-developed-tech-in-just-6-months/articleshow/89189778.cms||---

Separately, the drug regulator also gave permission to the pharmaceutical company to conduct Phase-3 clinical trial to compare the immunogenicity and safety of the intranasal vaccine candidate with Covaxin, which has also been developed and manufactured by Bharat Biotech.  This trial would be conducted in nine sites, including AIIMS Delhi and Patna. The development assumes significance because once the nasal vaccine gets final approval for use, it has the potential to massively ramp up vaccination against Covid as it is likely to be far more affordable, easy to administer and not require clinical setting or healthcare workers for administration of doses.  At present, over 23 crore doses of Covaxin have been administered, accounting for 14% of the total nearly 165 crore doses given across the country. The Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) gave a ‘No Objection Certificate’ to the Hyderabad-based vaccine maker on Thursday allowing it to conduct randomised Phase 3 multi-centric clinical trials with the intranasal vaccine candidate as a third shot to those who have received two doses of Covid vaccines.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bharat-biotech-gets-regulator-nod-for-phase-3-trial-of-nasal-vaccine/articleshow/89189798.cms||Sushmi Dey
---||India||Claims made at event Ansari addressed preposterous: Govt||NEW DELHI: The government on Friday slammed the event organised by Indian American Muslim Council (IAMC), where former vice president Hamid Ansari and four US lawmakers had expressed concerns about the human rights situation in India, saying the claims made were preposterous and that India didn’t need a “certification” from others. The MEA said India was a vibrant democracy and that the track record of the event’s organisers was as well known as the biases and political interests of the participants. “We have seen reports on this event. India is a robust and vibrant democracy. It does not require certification from others.” The claim that others need to protect our Constitution is “presumptuous and preposterous”, said spokesperson Arindam Bagchi. During the event, Ansari had said, “emergence of trends and practices that dispute the well-established principle of civic nationalism and interpose a new and imaginary practice of cultural nationalism”. BJP and Union ministers attacked the former Vice-President, also a former diplomat, for his remarks. Democratic Senator Ed Markey, who has a history of taking anti-India stands, had said, “As the Indian government continues to target the practices of minority faiths, it creates an atmosphere where discrimination and violence can take root. In recent years, we have seen an uptick in online hate speeches and acts of hate, including vandalised mosques, torched churches, and communal violence.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/claims-made-at-event-ansari-addressed-preposterous-govt/articleshow/89189842.cms||---
---||World||Omicron drives US deaths higher than Delta wave||Omicron, the highly contagious coronavirus variant sweeping across the country, is driving the daily American death toll higher than during last fall's Delta wave, with deaths likely to keep rising for days or even weeks.  The seven-day rolling average for daily new Covid-19 deaths in the U.S. has been climbing since mid-November, reaching 2,267 on Thursday and surpassing a September peak of 2,100 when Delta was the dominant variant.  Now Omicron is estimated to account for nearly all the virus circulating in the nation. And even though it causes less severe disease for most people, the fact that it is more transmissible means more people are falling ill and dying.  "Omicron will push us over a million deaths," said Andrew Noymer, a public health professor at the University of California, Irvine. "That will cause a lot of soul searching. There will be a lot of discussion about what we could have done differently, how many of the deaths were preventable."  Omicron symptoms are often milder, and some infected people show no symptoms, researchers agree. But like the flu, it can be deadly, especially for people who are older, have other health problems or who are unvaccinated.  "Importantly, 'milder' does not mean 'mild'," Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said this week during a White House briefing.  Until recently, Chuck Culotta was a healthy middle-aged man who ran a power-washing business in Milford, Delaware. As the Omicron wave was ravaging the Northeast, he felt the first symptoms before Christmas and tested positive on Christmas Day. He died less than a week later, on Dec. 31, nine days short of his 51st birthday.  He was unvaccinated, said his brother, Todd, because he had questions about the long-term effects of the vaccine.  "He just wasn't sure it was the right thing to do - yet," said Todd who got his shots during the summer.  At one urban hospital in Kansas, 50 COVID-19 patients have died this month and more than 200 are being treated. University of Kansas Hospital in Kansas City, Kansas, posted a video from its morgue showing bagged bodies in a refrigeration unit and a worker marking one white body bag with the word "COVID."  "This is real," said Ciara Wright, the hospital's decedent affairs coordinator. "Our concerns are, 'Are the funeral homes going to come fast enough?' We do have access to a refrigerated truck. We don't want to use it if we don't have to."  Dr. Katie Dennis, a pathologist who does autopsies for the health system, said the morgue has been at or above capacity almost every day in January, "which is definitely unusual".  With more than 878,000 deaths, the United States has the largest Covid-19 toll of any nation.  During the coming week, almost every U.S. state will see a faster increase in deaths, although fatalities have peaked in a few states, including New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Iowa, Maryland, Alaska and Georgia, according to the COVID-19 Forecast Hub.  New hospital admissions have started to fall for all age groups, according to CDC data, and a drop in deaths is expected to follow.  "In a pre-pandemic world, during some flu seasons, we see 10,000 or 15,000 deaths. We see that in the course of a week sometimes with COVID," said Nicholas Reich, who aggregates coronavirus projections for the hub in collaboration with the CDC.  "The toll and the sadness and suffering is staggering and very humbling," said Reich, a professor of biostatistics at University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Meanwhile, the White House said Friday that about 60 million households ordered 240 million home-test kits under a new government program to expand testing opportunities. The government also said it has shipped tens of millions of masks to convenient locations around the country, including deliveries Friday to community centers in Delaware, Maryland and Virginia. The national drugstore chain Walgreens, which is among the pharmacies receiving the government-provided masks, has started offering N95 masks for free at several stores, as long as supplies last. The company's website lists locations in the Midwest for the initial wave of stores offering masks, but Walgreens said more stores will offer them soon. The leading organization for state and local public health officials has also called on governments to stop conducting widespread contact tracing, saying it's no longer necessary. The Association of State and Territorial Health Officials urged governments to focus contact tracing efforts on high-risk, vulnerable populations such as people in homeless shelters and nursing homes.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/omicron-drives-us-deaths-higher-than-delta-wave/articleshow/89189855.cms||---

Speaking at a ‘Jan samvad’ event, Yogi said, “When I am in Meerut, how can I forget farmers? And when I talk about farmers, how can I forget the messiah of farmers, Chaudhary Charan Singh ji. His dreams have been turned into reality by PM Modi. The previous SP government, however, had no vision for development and only incited riots in Muzaffarnagar.” “They (SP) have done nothing for the development of villagers or even pilgrims.

We developed pilgrimage sites,” Yogi added. He alleged that “now, money is used to develop temples whereas earlier, it was used to build boundary walls of graveyards.” Earlier in the day, the CM held an extensive election campaign in Meerut.

The list of 91 candidates has maximum Brahmins — 21 — as per the caste balance of the eastern region which votes in the fourth and fifth phases. Besides, 20 candidates from the OBCs have made it to the list, emphasising the backward outreach of the party. BJP won 76 of these 91 seats in 2017. Two of them have defected while one succumbed to Covid last year. The party has also replaced two MLAs with their kin. Out of 71 sitting MLAs, it has retained 53, or nearly 77%, and changed the seat of one minister. The list also has nine women candidates. While most of the 13 ministers have been fielded again, the party has replaced cooperative minister Mukut Bihari Verma with his son Gaurav in Kaiserganj. Another senior minister, Shriram Chauhan, has been shifted from his Dhanghata seat to Khajni. In Dhanghata, he has been replaced by Ganesh Chauhan.

The Election Commission of India has put a ban on physical rallies and road shows till January 31 due to surging cases of Covid-19. The PM may address similar virtual rallies further if ECI extends the ban on physical rallies and road shows, sources in the BJP said. Sources told TOI that the rally on January 31 would be planned in such a way that it would cover at least four to five districts of the west UP region in one go. As per the initial plan, this rally would cover districts like Saharanpur, Baghpat, Shamli, Muzaffarnagar and Gautam Buddh Nagar. The party plans to target around 21 assembly constituencies through this rally. Though the draft proposal to hold it is being readied, sources said that each BJP mandal would have one LED screen on display for the PM’s virtual rally in these districts. The target is to bring around 500 people – the maximum number permitted by the EC for a meeting – to one LED screen. This way through LED screens, the party plans to reach out to around 50,000 people in one virtual rally, sources said. Besides LED screens, PM Modi’s virtual address would be streamed live on all platforms of social media, sources said and added that the BJP think tank wants to utilize the PM’s popularity among the masses and mobilize the people in support of the BJP through these virtual rallies. Such virtual rallies may be organized further as well, but that will depend on the EC’s decision on the ban on physical rallies, the sources said. Until now, BJP leaders, including Union home minister Amit Shah, BJP national chief JP Nadda, chief minister Yogi Adityanath, deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya, UP BJP chief Swatantra Deo Singh and others have been holding door-to-door campaigns in the west UP region. Union home minister Amit Shah would be in Muzaffarangar and Saharanpur district on Saturday to hold a door-to-door contact programme. He would be holding a door-to-door programme in Deoband, where the Yogi government has recently announced to set up a unit of Anti-Terror Squad (ATS).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/pm-modi-to-address-his-1st-up-virtual-rally-on-january-31/articleshow/89189960.cms||Rajiv Srivastava

---||---||CM face in Punjab polls: Party pressure, AAP forced Rahul hand||NEW DELHI: Congress MP Rahul Gandhi’s surprise announcement that the party will declare its chief ministerial candidate for Punjab flows from unceasing pressure from party workers that they need to have clarity on the leadership issue to seek votes when its key rival AAP has gone ahead with projecting its future leader. Although Congress has an old policy of not projecting a CM, the party has made exceptions in the past with Rahul announcing Amarinder Singh as the future CM in 2012 Punjab polls, which the party ended up losing. At the heart of Congress’ decision to come out with a CM candidate is the uncertainty triggered by the presence of a sitting chief minister in Charanjit Channi and an ambitious and unrelenting PCC chief in Navjot Sidhu. It is a fact that the sitting CM is normally the de facto face in Congress book, but constant claims to the top post from Sidhu have undercut any automatic projection for Channi. Channi is a Dalit that the party has made a big noise about to woo the key social demography in Punjab, and it’s felt that Congress can’t go back on his candidature. Earlier, the decision to go into polls with collective leadership was rooted in the concern that any upfront projection of Channi could result in a possible dissent from Sidhu. That the party had to come around and bite the bullet shows the pressure both from the workers and from AAP. The other rival Akali Dal has the settled leadership in Sukhbir Badal, though senior Badal is also in the fray. Given that Congress will now come out with a CM candidate, the party steps into the sticky territory of possible sullenness from the left out candidate that it can ill afford in a very tight poll. Party members claim ground work has been done on the issue and consent has been secured from leaders that they would abide by party decision. A possible window for announcement could be the release of the party manifesto, though the date of announcement is not known yet.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/punjab/news/cm-face-in-punjab-polls-party-pressure-aap-forced-rahul-hand/articleshow/89190005.cms||---

In the last two days, a team from Civil Hospital has arrested three quacks, including the latest. The accused was carrying out abortion illegally with pregnancy abortion kit, which he was selling for Rs 500. Deputy surgeon, Dr Pradeep Kumar, had received information about the quack practising as doctor and getting engaged in illegal abortion through medical termination of pregnancy (MTP) kits. After receiving the tip-off, a team of surgeons arranged a decoy who posed as a pregnant lady and caught hold of the quack. “Our team raided and nabbed a quack practicing as doctor and performing illegal termination of pregnancy,” Kumar said. The arrested man has been identified as Ram Prakash Goel, who was practicing as a doctor at City Medicos in Gagandeep Complex of the Civil Lines area. He allegedly used to provide MTP kits to pregnant women during the night to avoid any suspicion. According to the police, Goel had completed a Pharma course and was practicing as a doctor for the past few months. A case has been registered under relevant sections of the IPC, the MTP Act, IMA Act and Drugs and Cosmetic Act. A day before, police had arrested two such quacks who were carrying illegal abortion and providing abortion kits.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/third-quack-arrested-in-city-in-2-days/articleshow/89190006.cms||---

The two were arrested along with a BSF deputy commandant, who had allegedly orchestrated the fraud during his deputation on the NSG campus in Manesar till May last year.Mamata Yadav, the wife of BSF deputy commandant Praveen Yadav, and his sister Rituraj had appealed for the bail on the ground that they had infants to look after. While Rituraj is mother to a two-month-old, Mamta has a 10-month-old child.The court, however, rejected their application, saying that being a mother to an infant could not be a reason strong enough to be granted bail in a serious crime. The court observed that since the investigation into the case was on, it would not be appropriate to grant them bail. The judge directed the jail authorities to give the two mothers nutritious food as they needed to feed their babies. Apart from Mamta, Rituraj and Praveen, police had arrested a property dealer, Dinesh, in connection with the fraud. Till now, five different cases have been registered against them.The five accused, the police said, had floated a company to transfer the money collected from the fraud into its accounts. Praveen had allegedly collected Rs 125 crore from several estate companies by “awarding contracts” for projects on the NSG campus that never existed. Rituraj, who worked with a private bank that has a branch on the NSG campus, had helped Praveen open an account in the name of “NSG” to park the money from the fraud.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/nsg-contract-fraud-2-women-denied-bail/articleshow/89190007.cms||---

The decision came with a view to encourage people to conduct more tests.Meanwhile, the cost of RT(PCR) still remains at Rs 299 while the private labs can charge Rs 499 in cases of home collection of samples. An order by Rajeev Arora, ACS (health), stated “After due consideration on the matter and advice of experts, taking into account the cost of kits and consumables and consent of leading private laboratories, the state government, in exercise of the powers bestowed under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897; directs that no private laboratory should charge any amount more than Rs 50 for antigen for COVID-19 testing, inclusive of GST/taxes, if any, cost involved in pick-up, PPE, packing, transportation of samples, documentation and reporting, in Haryana.”The order also directed that all the laboratories conducting Covid testing must adhere to the guidelines and SOPs and shall follow all the testing protocols laid down by ICMR and MoHFW. “Non-adherence to these orders may invoke penalty under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code,” the order further stated.Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said, “We have informed all private labs and hospitals in the districts to charge Rs 50 for antigen tests.” As for Gurgaon, the city has been carrying out 1,000 antigen tests and more than 8,000 RT(PCR) tests daily to trace the Covid cases at the earliest and start the treatment.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/haryana-slashes-antigen-test-rate-from-250-to-50/articleshow/89190009.cms||---

---||Gurgaon||Gurugram: 600 families living in Raheja Atharva society in dark for 5 hours over non-payment of electricity bills||GURUGRAM: More than 600 families living in Sector 109’s Raheja Atharva society were left with no power supply for over five hours on Thursday as the discom disconnected their electricity connection owing to non-payment of bills amounting to Rs 1.1 crore. The residents, however, claim that the matter is sub-judice in the district court, which has granted them an interim relief and issued a stay order over the disconnection of temporary electricity. According to residents, a temporary electricity connection was allowed by the Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (DHBVN), the discom, for the purpose of construction of the society earlier. However, even after the possession of flats, which started in July 2014, the developer has till date not converted it into a domestic connection. In April last year, the DHBVN issued a notification stating that it would charge a rate that is double of the total consumption of units plus the fixed charges, from those who have taken a temporary connection for a period of more than two years. Fearing disconnection, the RWA of the society in November filed a petition in the district court against the developer and DHBVN seeking relief from any action from the authorities, the residents said. “As per the provision of the occupancy certificate (OC), the domestic electricity connection was required to be provided by developer within 15 days of issue of OCs, but it has not been done till date. On November 18, the court granted us interim relief and a stay over the disconnection of electricity and subsequently on December 21, the court directed the developer to pay the difference of amount between domestic and non-domestic rates,” said Prem Singh, RWA president of Raheja Atharva. “While we have tried to deposit our part of the bill at the domestic rate, the discom has refused to accept the bill payment in parts,” he added. A DHBVN official said, “Their electricity bill has been due for two months. Even the court has directed both the RWA and the developers to deposit the amount jointly. We cannot receive the payment in parts. It is the responsibility of the developer to build the electricity infrastructure and take permanent connection.” Meanwhile, a Raheja Developers Limited official said, “We have already held several meetings with the RWA members and are committed to provide the permanent connection. We will soon start the process to build electricity infrastructure.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/over-1cr-due-600-families-in-dark-for-5-hours/articleshow/89190012.cms||Akanksha Gupta

Backed by members of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), the protesters accused the government of not meeting their demands despite repeated promises. The villagers said that in 2015, they had reached a 10-point agreement with the Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (HSIIDC) after giving up their land years earlier.“The government had agreed to undertake a slew of development work while acquiring our land. They had promised to provide water supply, electricity, jobs, a school, a nursing college, crematoriums, etc. It has been seven years since these promises were made. But none have been fulfilled so far,” said one of the protesters, Abrar Khan. The farmers threatened to intensify the agitation if their demands were not met soon.Sub-divisional magistrate Saloni Sharma visited the site to pacify the villagers. A team of 13 farmers then met the DC, Shakti Singh, at the district collectorate. “We have temporarily suspended our protest. But if the demands are delayed again, we will launch a massive agitation here,” said Ravi Azad, a BKU youth leader.In 2009-10, 1,600 acres had been acquired by HSIIDC for developing an industrial model township. After the initial transfer of compensation by the administration, the farmers from nine villages in the vicinity had protested against the low rate being offered to them.“They think we are ignorant. Had the land been acquired in Gurgaon, all demands would have been met. But since this is Nuh, they think they can scuttle our voices,” said Khan.“We are looking into their demands and have assured them all help. We are also looking to provide jobs to local youths,” Singh said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/demands-not-met-for-7-years-farmers-protest/articleshow/89190013.cms||Sagrika Kissu

But while the minimum temperature rose marginally from Thursday’s 5.5 degrees Celsius to 5.8 degrees Celsius, it was still two notches below the season’s normal. The daytime temperature increased to 19.2 degrees Celsius, from 18.1 degrees Celsius a day before, still three notches below the normal mark.According to the IMD, the skies are likely to remain clear over the next five days with a gradual increase in minimum temperature, while the daytime temperature is expected to hover around 17-19 degrees Celsius. Manmohan Singh, director, IMD Chandigarh, said, “There is a rise in the maximum temperature but it remains below the season’s normal due to the prevailing strong surface winds with a speed of 10-20 kmph blowing in the city. A feeble western disturbance is expected to impact the region on Saturday leading to gradual increase in night time temperature in the coming days. Another active western disturbance and its induced cyclonic circulation will have an effect around February 2 and may lead to rain at isolated places, according to the IMD. The minimum and maximum temperatures are expected to be around 6 and 17 degrees Celsius, respectively, on Saturday. Meanwhile, strong surface winds helped clear pollutants as the city’s air quality improved to moderate category after witnessing three poor air days. The overall AQI reading was at 164, better from 228 on the previous day. Three of the four monitoring stations including Gwalpahari, Sector 51 and Teri Gram recorded the AQI in moderate level with a reading of 114, 199 and 128, respectively.

---||Gurgaon||Nod not taken? Bandhwari waste tenders put on hold||Gurgaon: The urban local bodies (ULB) department of the Haryana government has directed MCG to put on hold all the tendering process for bio-remediation and bio-mining of legacy waste at the Bandhwari landfill site with immediate effect. The reason stated behind the step is that the civic body did not take any administrative approval before floating these tenders. However, the MCG officials claim that approvals were taken and the process has been done in accordance with the action plan submitted to the NGT.MCG had last year given the contract of clearing and processing 2 lakh tonnes of waste at Bandhwari to a private firm. On similar lines, MCG also recently floated two tenders of Rs 16 crore each to give contracts to private firms to clear and process the waste dumped at the landfill site, for which the ULB has raised an objection. The tenders were floated on the risk and cost of MCG’s waste management concessionaire, Ecogreen.MCG also wrote to the ULB department on January 26 stating that the civic body had taken an administrative approval to spend Rs 256 crore on the project. “We had taken administrative approval, as well as rate approval, and now have sent our comments to the director of urban local bodies. The tenders were floated in accordance with the action plan submitted to the NGT,” said Vaishali Sharma, additional commissioner, MCG.The MCG further said that they have been given a deadline to clear the waste, failing which they will be penalised by the NGT. “We have been given a deadline to clear 35 lakh tonne of legacy waste from Bandhwari landfill site by July this year, failing which a heavy penalty can be imposed by the NGT. We have so far cleared around 8 lakh tonnes and the tenders had been floated to expedite the work of clearing and processing legacy waste,” said Anil Mehta, consultant-engineer and Swachh Bharat Mission, MCG.According to directions sent by the ULB department to MCG, Ecogreen, on January 13 submitted a complaint challenging the civic body’s decision to float fresh tenders for the waste processing at Bandhwari landfill site on the risk and cost of Ecogreen, which implies that the concessionaire will have to bear the cost of these tenders or projects.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/nod-not-taken-bandhwari-waste-tenders-put-on-hold/articleshow/89190016.cms||Vishakha Chaman
---||Gurgaon||Charging station for 100 vehicles, largest so far, opens doors in Gurugram||GURUGRAM: A charging station for electric cars that can accommodate 100 vehicles at the same time, making it the largest such facility in the country, was launched in the city on Friday. The station, built by a private company but part of a government initiative to strengthen the support infrastructure for EVs as India gears up to usher in the electric era, will act as a prototype for the larger rollout of a charging network on the Delhi-Jaipur highway, officials said. The charging station at Sector 52 was unveiled by National Highways for EV (NHeV), an entity to promote electric mobility on highways. Built by Alektrify Pvt Ltd, it is equipped with 72 AC slow chargers and 24 DC fast chargers. Abhijeet Sinha, project director of NHeV said the privately owned charging hub will serve as a prototype for around 10 charging stations proposed on the Delhi-Jaipur highway that will be jointly owned by the Centre under the public-private-partnership (PPP) model. “This ultra-modern station is now open to meet all regulatory standards set by the government. It will also set the standard as a prototype station for all upcoming EV charging stations of the NHeV pilot project to build India’s first 500 km e-highway between Jaipur, Delhi and Agra,” said Sinha. Sudhendu J Sinha, adviser (infrastructure connectivity – transport and electric mobility) at Niti Aayog, who was present for the unveiling, emphasised the need to boost charging infrastructure. “We have noticed that range anxiety associated with EVs continues to be a challenge and that necessitates the need for robust charging infrastructure, especially on highways. This prototype will help us in setting up such charging stations every 50km, whereby the time a car owner stops for a tea beak, the car’s battery gets charged,” he said. “Alektrify is an official commissioning and installation partner company of NHeV pilot for setting up charging stations on the Jaipur-Delhi-Agra highway,” said Praveen Kumar, the MD of Alektrify. In the first phase of the Delhi-Jaipur e-highway project, around 10 such charging stations – four on each side of the highway and one each in Gurgaon and Jaipur – will be built, according to NHeV. EV charging hubs on the highways will be developed as wayside amenities with food courts and marts, besides screens for advertising revenue. “One of the major hindrances in setting up EV charging infrastructure is the ambiguity around design, compliances with safety norms and standards, and scepticism towards the profitability. This prototype aims to address all that,” said Abhijeet Sinha.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/charging-station-for-100-vehicles-largest-so-far-opens-doors-in-city/articleshow/89190017.cms||---

Expressing concern over the growing problem of call drops or non-receipt of calls in the city, the deputy commissioner reviewed the pending applications for the new towers proposed by the telecom companies to accommodate the increased demand. He directed all the department officials to clear all the roadblocks and facilitate the expansion of telecom infrastructure. “The time limit for the disposal of an application for a new telecom tower has been fixed at 45 days under the Right to Service Act,” said deputy commissioner Yash Garg. “Under the act, it becomes the responsibility of the departmental officer to dispose of the pending applications within the stipulated time period. If the application formalities are lacking, explain the reasons, but don't keep them pending for too long,” he told the officials. The DC further directed MCG commissioner Darshan Yadav to prepare a list of the pending applications by forming a team and ensure their disposal at the earliest. Earlier this month, TOI had reported that the telecom companies were witnessing over 50% increase in data usage in select areas because of work-from-home and online education due to the Omicron-led third wave. “There aren’t any issues in the services as such. It is just that there’s a sudden spike, over 50%, in data usage in certain residential pockets,” said an industry insider. “Due to the third wave, offices and schools are shut and traffic has now spiked in certain pockets. There are no issues where we have sufficient towers. However, certain areas where we have been struggling to erect more towers are facing network issues.” The representatives of the telecom operators told TOI that they had apprised the district administration of the challenges they were facing in scaling up their infrastructure to accommodate the increased demand. “Besides the clearance delay from multiple government departments, RWAs act as pressure bodies and roadblock our attempts to increase the number of towers. There’s a misconception that radiation from these towers have an adverse impact on health,” said a representative of a telecom giant. In today’s meeting, the administration acknowledged the problem and asked the officials to dispel the misinformation that obstructs the delivery of better telecom services.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/call-drop-clear-decks-for-more-towers-says-dc/articleshow/89190018.cms||Siddharth Tiwari

Ghaziabad also vaccinated more than 20,000 people on Friday. Over 32,000 people have received their booster doses. The number of patients has remained stable for the past week in the two districts. But 19 deaths have been reported from the districts this month. “The overall mortality rate this wave compared to the last two has been, fortunately, very low. Most of the deaths in the third wave have been due to poor heart function or comorbidity of the patient. People are recovering well, this time. In cases of fatalities, patients did not die because of Covid but due to their comorbid complications,” said Dr Arjun Khanna, a senior pulmonologist at Yashoda hospital.The doctors also said that recovered patients are facing lesser complications this time. Some people are still experiencing body aches and weakness after recovering, but their symptoms are not as severe or long-lasting as in the patients who had turned positive during the second wave, the doctors added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/gb-nagar-records-two-more-covid-deaths-376-cases/articleshow/89190019.cms||---

---||Noida||One more halt for fast trains on Aqua Line||Noida: One more station — Sector 148 — has been added to the number of halts for fast trains on Aqua Line from February 1, officials have said. Of the 21 stations on the line, only four stations remain now where the fast trains will not stop due to low footfall. These are sectors 144, 145, 146 and 147 stations.Noida Metro Rail Corporation (NMRC) introduced fast trains on Aqua Line in February last year to reduce the travel time of commuters. Initially, of the 21 stations, the fast trains were to skip 10 during peak hours. In May, the metro line was shut due to the Covid-induced lockdown for nearly 40 days. When services resumed on June 9, 2021, the fast trains continued to skip the 10 stations.However, with the subsequent fall in the number of Covid cases and due to public demand, the Noida Metro allowed the fast trains to halt at the Sector 81 station from August 2. And from August 31, four more stations were added to the list — sectors 50, 101, 83 and 143.On January 28, the Noida Metro again reviewed the footfall at stations and decided to allow a halt at Sector 148 from February 1. “Keeping in view the popular public demand and increased development near the Sector-148 station, the fast trains will now stop at the station from February 1,” said Ritu Maheshwari, the managing director of NMRC.“With this, now only four stations remain which the fast trains will continue to skip,” said a spokesperson for NMRC.Fast trains on NMRC’s Aqua Line run during peak hours — from 8am to 11am and from 5pm to 8pm — on weekdays. They do not run on weekends and on gazetted holidays. While the fast train frequency is 10 minutes during peak hours from Mondays to Fridays, it’s increased to 15 minutes during non-peak hours.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/one-more-halt-for-fast-trains-on-aqua-line/articleshow/89190022.cms||Meenakshi Sinha

---||Noida||Repair work on Noida e-way may not be over before April||Noida: Commuters looking forward to a seamless ride on the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway will have to wait for three more months. This is because the deadline for the completion of the resurfacing work on the high-speed corridor has been extended yet again. The expressway is not going to be ready before the end of April, officials said.The work on the stretch commenced in December 2020 with a deadline of six to seven months. The 24-km-long corridor, out of which a 20-km stretch falls in Noida and the remaining in Greater Noida, was to be resurfaced through ‘hot-in-place recycling technology” at a cost of Rs 61 crore. In July 2021, the deadline was extended to December 31 at the request of the contractor.“We have now issued an ultimatum to the contractor to finish the work by April 30. Post that, we will impose a hefty penalty on the contractor,” said Noida CEO Ritu Maheshwari.Officials said the Authority could impose a penalty of Rs 1 crore on the contractor if it fails to meet the April 30 deadline. Earlier a penalty of Rs 52 lakh was imposed on the contractor for missing the deadlines.In its representation before the Authority, the contractor cited a ban on construction work due to the graded response action plan (curbs put in place to check pollution levels in NCR) and intermittent showers as the reasons for its failure to adhere to the project’s deadlines.Meanwhile, in another development that will benefit the population staying in the 7X sectors and the ones staying in Kakrala and Sorkha, four community centres will come up in sectors 73, 112, 116 and 117. Authority officials said that work has started at the four locations and the centres would be ready within four months. A budget of close to Rs 12 crore has been set aside for setting up the community centres.A lot of families opt to book community centres for weddings and other social events as the private banquet halls remain out of their budget. Atul Yadav, a resident of Sector 71, said, “People staying in urban villages are unable to afford the private banquet halls, and community centres are feasible options for them.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/repair-work-on-noida-e-way-may-not-be-over-before-april/articleshow/89190029.cms||---

Based on preliminary investigations and a statement from her husband Dr Neeraj, 29, police described it as a death by suicide. While the reason for the extreme step is yet to be fully established, police said postpartum depression is the likely reason and added they did not recover any death note from her. Police sources said there was a cut on her neck. Doctors declared Soundarya dead at the private hospital. Her body was subsequently shifted to Bowring Hospital for autopsySoundarya was daughter of Padmavati, elder daughter of Yediyurappa. She married Dr S Neeraj, a radiologist with MS Ramaiah Hospital, in 2018. Soundarya had completed post-graduation in general surgery from MS Ramaiah Hospital. The doctor-couple was living on the first floor of an apartment complex on Cunningham Road for two years along with their nine-month-old son. Police said Dr Neeraj left for hospital around 8.30am and their maid and nanny were at the flat on their morning errands. The baby was fast asleep in one room, and the second room was closed long enough to stoke suspicion. Observing this, the maid and the nanny alerted the apartment's security personnel, who went to the balcony of an adjacent bedroom and peeped through the window to find her hanging. The nanny informed Dr Neeraj. By the time he reached the flat, security guards and others had broken open the door and were preparing to shift Soundarya to a hospital. By then, Soundarya's mother Padmavati and other family members had rushed to the flat. At the private hospital, doctors declared Soundarya dead. The body was shifted to Bowring Hospital for autopsy. Around 3.30pm, the body was taken to Dr Neeraj's farmhouse ‘Kalpavruskha' in Abbigere, near Soladevanahalli in the northern part of city, where last rites were performed late evening. A family source said Soundarya, after delivery, was living with her mother in Sanjaynagar for some time. Saying she could manage on her own, Soundarya returned to the flat on Thursday morning along with the nanny. Soundarya's father Virupaksahappa was in Hubballi when the incident took place. He arrived at the farmhouse for last rites. Khwaja Hussain, manager of the apartment, said the couple shifted to the flat two years ago. "They were amiable and would warmly greet us whenever we met. The couple would order many products online and request us to collect them when the parcels arrived at the building in their absence. We had seen them always happy," he said.

A single bench of Justice Vibha Kankanwadi made the observation earlier this month while hearing a bail application filed by the godman Shankeshwar Dhakne and his disciple Sopan Dhanke, arrested for allegedly raping the minor girl. The two accused lived in a temple at Badnapur in Jalna district along with the girl and her father. The girl on August 2021 filed FIR against the duo for allegedly raping her, following which they were arrested. Justice Kankanwadi in her order took note of the prosecution’s case that in 2018, a document styled as “danpatra” on a stamp paper of Rs 100 was executed between the girl’s father and Dhakne. “It is stated that the father of the girl has given his daughter on donation (daan) to the baba and it is stated that the said ‘kanyadan’ has been made in the presence of god. When the girl as per her own statement is minor, then why the father, who is in all respect guardian, to the girl, give the girl as Daan?” the court said in its order.  “A girl is not a property, which can be given in donation,” Justice Kankanwadi said, adding that this was a disturbing fact. The court granted bail to the duo.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/hc-raps-father-for-donating-girl-says-she-isnt-a-property/articleshow/89190048.cms||---

Inquiries have revealed that the accused, identified as Raju Salve, had been convicted of the murder of his wife and had currently been out on parole. He has been booked on molestation charges and was subsequently granted bail by a railway court. The couple were travelling in the general compartment of a Borivli-bound local from Churchgate. Around 10.30pm, they stood in the passage of the compartment, waiting for their turn to get off. According to the police, Salve came up and stood right behind the woman, who is in her mid-twenties. “As the train was entering Dadar station’s platform 3, Salve touched the woman inappropriately from behind. The woman did not raise an alarm at that moment. But seconds later, as the couple was getting off on the platform, Salve groped the woman again. This time, she complained to the husband who yelled at Salve and caught hold of him with the help of co-passengers,” said an officer from Mumbai Central Government Railway Police. Police personnel patrolling the platform were summoned and Salve was handed over to them. “Salve claimed that he hadn’t done anything wrong.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Private medical colleges' fees rise 2%-10%; parents seek check on deposits||MUMBAI: Fees at several private medical colleges have gone up by 2% to 10%. Most colleges had sought higher fee hikes this year, citing deficit in hospital revenue in the pandemic. Not all proposals, though, were approved by the Fee Regulating Authority (FRA). From the pre-Covid year of 2019, the fees have gone up by up to 20%. Meanwhile, parents want fees charged under other heads such as caution money to be monitored too. Fees at Vedantaa Institute of Medical Sciences, Palghar, the college registered under the Companies Act, dropped marginally from Rs 16.6 lakh to Rs 16.3 lakh this year, but increased by 12.4% since 2019-20. Vedantaa charges the highest fees among all private colleges in the state. There is no fee hike at Kashibai Navale Medical College, Pune. Fees at Amravati’s PDMC, Ahmednagar’s Vikhe Patil College and Nashik’s SMBT College went up by 10% compared with the previous year. A few colleges opted for no upward revision from their last year’s fee. An FRA official said several colleges had submitted proposals for a higher fee hike, citing a deficit in hospital revenues. The patient count had increased at these hospitals during the pandemic, but since they were in remote or tribal areas, they were unable to charge a lot for treatment, they said. One of the colleges even showed a deficit of up to Rs 50 crore. “We have ensured that the fee hike is not drastic and at the same time is also rationalised. In some cases, it has reduced too,” said the official. The approval of fees was delayed this year on account of the pandemic. Students have already started filling their choices for the counselling round. Most students went by the interim fees put up by the colleges on their website. Sudha Shenoy, a parent representative, said the FRA should also check colleges’ portals as many are seeking caution money to the extent of Rs 1 lakh.  “For one of the colleges, the fee approved is Rs 11.6 lakh, but the total amount goes up to Rs 14.6 lakh, including all one-time, refundable deposits. This deposit money is returned to students after course completion. Colleges earn interest on this sum. These should be monitored too,” she said. Another college charges up to 40% more than the approved fees, under the pretext of refundable deposits. She further said there was no need for a fee hike as the expenditure on students reduced to a great extent in the past two years due to online classes. The FRA also fixed fees for post-graduate courses. “At some places, the fees have been reduced for merit seats as they were cross-subsidised with the fees charged for NRI seats,” said an official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/pvt-med-edu-fees-rise-2-10-parents-seek-check-on-deposits/articleshow/89190056.cms||Yogita Rao
---||Mumbai||What of 12 MLC names pending with governor: Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut||MUMBAI: Responding to the SC verdict setting aside suspension of 12 BJP MLAs, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut asked why no sympathy was extended to the MVA government’s nomination for appointment of 12 legislators under the governor’s quota. The nominations have been pending with governor B S Koshyari for over a year. “12 who created a ruckus in the Speaker’s chamber were subjected to disciplinary action. The SC has shown sympathy to these people, then why don’t our 12 legislators have the right to sympathy? I am surprised SC is not ready to intervene in the case of MLCs to be nominated by the governor,” Raut said. He said suspension of 12 BJP MLAs was the right of the assembly. “SC has encroached on the right of the assembly. In fact, SC has not ruled on suspension of some of our MPs in RS. The nomination of our 12 MLCs is stuck for two years,” said Raut. Legislative affairs minister Anil Parab said the MVA government would study the SC’s order. “We had also consulted legal experts. So far, courts had not intervened in matters pertaining to working of legislature. We will study the order,” he said. The NCP said the decision to suspend the 12 MLAs was taken by the Speaker’s office after following due procedure, and not by the MVA government. “The proposal was put forward by the person in the Speaker’s chair and passed by the majority in the assembly,” pointed out minority affairs minister Nawab Malik. “Are the rights of state assemblies and the Parliament final or are they subject to court rulings? The assembly secretariat will study this and the Speaker will take a final decision,” said Malik.  Sena leader Bhaskar Jadhav, who was presiding officer when BJP MLAs were suspended, said, “The arms of government cannot interfere with each other. According to rules, the decision taken by assembly can only be reversed within the assembly. I have my doubts about whether SC can take such a decision. I feel this conflict will deepen.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/what-of-12-mlc-names-pending-with-guv-raut/articleshow/89190057.cms||---

The panel will prepare an interim report and meet on February 4 to finalise it. The next Supreme Court hearing is on February 8.In the last SC hearing, the state government had requested that it be allowed to conduct the remaining elections with the 27% OBC quota on the basis of OBC data already available with it. The court said the state should present the data to the MSBCC, which should examine its correctness and make a recommendation to the state. The state government had then handed over the data to the panel, which included NSSO material, data on OBC representation in polls available with district collectors, data from education and social justice departments, and admissions data, sources said. However, what will be key is data on the political representation of OBCs, not their socio-economic status or their numbers.In the past, the MSBCC had rejected the data provided by the Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics since it had reflected the socio-economic status of the communities. —Priyanka Kakodkar||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/commission-meets-to-review-state-data-on-obcs/articleshow/89190058.cms||---

The power distribution losses of MSEDCL, with a consumer base of 2.8 crore, is the highest in the state at over 10%.The smart meters can also prevent power theft. For example, if there is any tampering of the meter by a third party, there is an inbuilt alert which goes off. An alert message will be sent to the server of MSEDCL and the customer is also informed of any kind of meter rigging.Experts said these meters will immensely benefit power utility firms to reduce the peak power consumption and control average cost of supply. “It will help us in load planning and load forecasting at any given time of the day or night as we can check the patterns of consumption across various pockets/power distribution areas remotely,” Singhal said.MSEDCL can switch off the smart meter remotely, and can also take meter readings without actually going to the site. This will be of great advantage during a lockdown.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/msedcl-to-install-10-lakh-smart-meters-across-state/articleshow/89190060.cms||Somit Sen

He was held days after the arrest of Aryan Khan, son of actor Shah Rukh Khan, at the terminal with no possession of any drugs. Khan was released on bail on orders of the Bombay high court after more than a month in custody. The NCB, also in an affidavit filed on Friday, sought dismissal of an application made by Sonu Mhaske, an independent witness who sought to resile from his statement and alleged he was forced to sign on a blank paper by the officers.The NCB reply by its intelligence officer, submitted in court by its special public prosecutor, said Mhaske’s application and affidavit dated November 24, 2021, was “misconceived and ill-conceived’’ and also “false, mischievous, misleading with a malicious attempt to malign and tarnish the image of the independent agency”. Mhaske is one of the independent witnesses in the case (pancha) and his voluntary statement has to be recorded, said the NCB, adding, “Not attending NCB office is only a ploy to not cooperate and cause hurdles in ongoing investigation”.On Shaikh, Sethna argued for hours at a hearing. The NCB, in its affidavit, also said it had found 2.5 gram of ecstasy and 54 gram commercial quantity in his conscious possession and hence bail must not be given. The probe shows he is a “supplier”, said the NCB, while Shaikh’s plea is that the NCB flouted rules and illegally detained him.Shaikh’s lawyer Kushal Mor said a pancha in his case was used by the NCB in 17 cases in a year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/ncb-opposes-bail-plea-of-supplier-in-cruise-raid-case/articleshow/89190061.cms||Swati Deshpande

Taking a dig at cabinet minister Aaditya Thackeray, BJP said while he inaugurated the revamped Worli ground, its official name was nowhere mentioned. “The BMC is tolerating Tipu Sultan’s nameboard on a Malad ground, but the official name of the Worli ground, named after Gandhi, is being done away with,” said BJP group leader Prabhakar Shinde, adding that the Shiv Sena-led panel asked the administration to submit its reply by next week. Shinde said if BMC does not reply, they would hold a Gandhi-style protest at the ground.G-South ward officials said locals call the Worli ground Jambori Maidan as a Scouting Jamboree was held there in 1920. “The official name is Mahatma Gandhi ground.

Special Judge R N Rokade then ‘issued process’ against all accused, requiring them to be represented through their legal representatives on the next date set for hearing and in a separate order issued notice on a fresh bail application filed by the Nationalist Congress Party leader. The bail hearing is now posted on February 4 for the special public prosecutor for ED to oppose and make his submissions. The ED filed its case after the CBI registered a case under prevention of corruption Act against him on April 21 last year for allegedly asking former police officer Sachin Waze to collect money from bars and restaurants. Deshmukh filed for his bail on grounds of merit of no evidence against him and that the trial is unlikely to start soon and that the ED has “played truant with process of courts and there is a grave overreach.’’ Filed through his lawyer, Aniket Nikam, his bail plea said he had “voluntarily arrived” at the ED office on November 1, 2021 on summons issued to him, as permitted by the Bombay High Court, where he was constantly questioned and finally arrested late night. The former minister alleged gross persecution. He said the ED has displayed a “dichotomy’’ in its stand on the material it has had with it in different courts to now say the material is enough for his arrest, when, in fact, he was summoned to be confronted with documents and questions changing his status overnight “from not an accused to an accused.’’ The ED has to first and essentially show there is adequate reasons and material with it to infer his guilt prima facie in money laundering before arresting him under PMLA, but he said his arrest “did not meet the compelling standards and parameters envisaged under section 19 of PMLA’’ and “proceeds of the crime’’ being generated is not established. His application said he “has been a member of the 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th and 14th Legislative Assembly, representing the Katol Vidhan Sabha constituency’’.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/pmla-court-issues-notice-on-bail-plea-of-anil-deshmukh/articleshow/89190071.cms||Swati Deshpande

The HC bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and M S Karnik sought suggestions by Wednesday from the petitioners Sneha Marjadi and others on steps to be taken by authorities and posted a batch of PIL to February 4. Marjadi had filed a PIL last year over the management of the Covid outbreak. Marjadi’s advocate Atharva Dandekar said Omicron is still a concern. The HC said the BMC senior counsel Anil Sakhare had earlier this week made a statement that the situation is better and steps and measures are being taken to contain the spread. The court asked why should the PIL flog a dead horse now. Government pleader Purnima Kantharia said the state too has filed a note on the steps taken and Mumbai was in a better position compared to earlier. Sakhare said, the “Covid trend is going down’’ and steps are being taken to reopen Mumbai. Sakhare submitted the BMC’s third note which stated that as on January 25, out of 21,142 active cases, only 16% were admitted in hospital, 7% on oxygen beds, 4% in ICU and 3%on ventilators. The state said, “The government is geared to meet any eventuality arising out of further spread of Omicron variant.”  The HC also referred to experts’ opinions and said that while Omicron was “less lethal” than other variants, “it spreads fast” and needs to be stopped by the authorities. The bench said it would take stock of the situation in the next hearing.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/efforts-are-on-to-reopen-mumbai-bmc-to-high-court/articleshow/89190074.cms||Swati Deshpande

Maharashtra has administered a total of 7.27 lakh precautionary doses since January 10. According to the state data, 3.37 lakh (46%) precautionary doses have been administered to people above 60 years. In comparison, a little over 2.08 lakh (28.7%) doses have been received by healthcare workers and 1.81 lakh (25%) by frontline workers. As expected, cities are leading the charts when it comes to administering the precautionary doses to seniors. Mumbai has given booster shots to 89,593 people above 60 years, Pune to 68,571 and Thane to 40,748. In some of the less developed districts, Gadchiroli and Hingoli for instance, less than 1,000 senior citizens have taken the third dose. Dr Sachin Desai, state’s immunization officer, said there is better awareness and demand for boosters among the bigger centres. Also, there is the question of eligibility as only those who have completed nine months since their second shot can take the precautionary dose. Intensivist Dr Rakesh Bhadade insisted that essential workers should take the booster shot without any second thoughts. “There is little doubt that the vaccination cover helped blunt the impact of the third wave to a great extent,” he added. State officials said that many essential workers who have got infected in the third wave won’t be able to take the precautionary shot immediately. The Centre has issued a guideline stating that people who have got infected recently can take the vaccine shot after 90 days.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/46-of-7l-booster-jabs-in-state-given-to-sr-citizens/articleshow/89190076.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Covid-19: Mumbai may see double-digit deaths for 2 more weeks, says government expert||MUMBAI: Even as Maharashtra recorded 103 deaths on Friday, officials said the state seems to be witnessing a peak of sorts in Covid mortality. The death toll has surged almost 10-15 days since the peak in cases during the third wave. At the state level, Pune circle added 40 deaths, the highest, and Mumbai reported 30. Cases were below 1,500 in the metropolis for the second consecutive day, with 1,312 cases registered on Friday against 1,384 on Thursday. It is the lowest since December 27 when 788 cases were recorded. However, a BMC official pointed out that the number of tests in Mumbai too had dropped drastically from 40,000 to 27,720 even though daily test positivity rate continued to stay below 5%. In Mumbai, the toll has continued to be in two digits since January 16 after staying in single digit for five months since August 2021. “The deaths in Mumbai are likely to remain in two digits for another two weeks or so,” said Dr Avinash Supe, a member of the state task force monitoring Covid deaths. He said the number of critical patients including ICU admissions is over 500 in Mumbai at the moment. “These are critical patients and, as per Covid trends seen during the last two waves, daily mortality could be between 10% and 20% in ICUs,” said Dr Supe. Regarding the drop in the state’s daily caseload for the second consecutive day, Dr Awate said it is now apparent that the Omicron-Covid wave has declined. “This declining trend could take up to another two to three weeks,” he added. Experts have maintained that the Omicron wave would have different peaks in different geographic locations within the same state. For instance, in the Pune belt, where the tally had climbed to 19,000-plus last week, cases dropped to 8,372 on Friday. Officials said with the declining trend in the state, it is likely that relaxations may be announced the next week. The state had imposed restrictions this month amid the fast spread of Omicron cases. “Just like reopening of schools and colleges, the state government will also consider giving relaxation to restaurants and other businesses,” said an official. Health minister Rajesh Tope said cases in Mumbai, Thane and Palghar are dropping and the state government has also asked the state and central task force to review Covid-related curbs.“The issue was discussed in the state cabinet on Thursday. CM Uddhav Thackeray was of the view that a discussion on how to live with Covid should be held afresh considering the drop in cases and many European countries are easing restrictions,” said Tope.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/city-may-see-double-digit-deaths-for-2-more-weeks-govt-expert/articleshow/89190077.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra covers 50% teen population with Covid vaccine, Mumbai lags||MUMBAI: The state has covered half its estimated adolescent population with a single dose of the Covid-19 vaccine in the past 25 days. Since the drive targeting the population between 15-17 years started on January 3, a total of 30.9lakh doses has been administered to this group. The state’s coverage is below the national average of 59% though. Maharashtra has an estimated 60.63 lakh people in this group. Officials said 51% have already taken the shot. "Our target is to cover everyone from this group by February," said Dr Sachin Desai, state immunisation officer. He said with colleges and schools resuming, the drive is expected to pick up pace. Lately, average daily vaccination numbers for this group has dropped to 45,000-50,000 from nearly a lakh in the initial days. Among districts, Pune (2,85,767) and Thane (2,53,977) have administered the highest doses followed by Mumbai (2,41,392), which has only managed 39% coverage till now. In comparison, districts like Bhandara and Kolhapur have covered 76% and 68% of teens already. Suresh Kakani, BMC additional municipal commissioner, said Mumbai's numbers will improve as camps have been planned in schools and colleges. "Our target is to cross 75% in the next ten days," he said. Of the estimated 6.12lakh in 15-17 age group, 2.41 lakh have taken the shot. Kakani said mandals are also being roped in to draw the younger population out. Mumbai, unlike other districts, had a slow start. Districts like Thane began camps within campuses right from the first day. Dr Desai said few cases of adverse effect are seen in the adolescent group. "We have more than 15lakh doses and can easily accelerate the drive," he said. The state, however, hasn’t received fresh Covaxin stocks in the past ten days. Desai said they are hoping that supplies will arrive before they are close to exhausting stocks.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/state-covers-50-teen-popln-with-vax-mumbai-lags/articleshow/89190078.cms||---

No cases were last reported from Dharavi on December 20, 2021. Currently, active Covid cases in the area stand at 43, of whom 11 have been hospitalised and 32 are either in home or institutional quarantine.

Civic officials said for Dharavi, the third wave began around December 27 and 1,381 cases have been reported till January 28. A maximum of 150 cases were recorded on a single day on January 7. This was much higher in comparison to the second wave, when the maximum cases on a single day were 99. In the first wave, it was 94. Dharavi had emerged as a barometer of Covid’s severity during the first wave, with BMC officials fearing the infection would spread too fast in the dense pocket for the healthcare system to cope.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/after-39-days-dharavi-records-zero-covid-cases/articleshow/89190079.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Mumbai||Vaxxed parents 72% less likely to pass on virus to kids: Study||Mumbai: Children who are unvaccinated against Covid-19 could get some protection from their vaccinated parents, according to an Israeli study. “Parental vaccination confers substantial protection for unvaccinated children in the same household,” said the research paper published in ‘Science’ journal. Vaccine expert, paediatrician Dr Nitin Shah from Hinduja Hospital, Mahim, said, “If parents are vaccinated, there is a lesser chance of them getting infected and passing it on to their child,’’ he said. The Israeli study, which looked at the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine, found that infectiousness to children from an infected parent vaccinated with two doses is “reduced by 72.1% compared to an unvaccinated parent.”In India, there was hesitancy in starting paediatric vaccination and mass immunisation for the 15-17 age group started less than a month back. “School-going children who need to give competitive exams are rightly being given priority in our country,’’ said Dr Shah. Younger children whose movements are restricted due to lockdowns, could mainly get infected at home. “Hence, vaccinated parents and elders would help keep children free of Covid,’’ said a doctor from Sion Hospital.On Friday, WHO’s chief scientist Dr Soumya Swaminathan tweeted about the Israeli study: “Parents being vaccinated protects their children from SARS-CoV-2 infection. If all adults can be vaccinated around the world, our children can enjoy their right to education, nutrition, play and friendships, which many millions are unfortunately missing today.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/vaxxed-parents-72-less-likely-to-pass-on-virus-to-kids-study/articleshow/89190080.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Easy money approach has served us well: RBI||MUMBAI: The RBI has said that India is on course to rank among the world’s fastest growing economies, but there is some distance to go. According to deputy governor Michael Patra, the RBI has taken a contrarian stance by maintaining an accommodative stance to support growth even as other central banks are tightening, and the approach has served the country well. “India held its ground and is among a few countries that have retained accommodative monetary policy, despite some views that we have fallen behind the curve. Only time will tell whether India has got it right but so far, this approach has served us well and helped chart a course into the future which is different from the world,” said Patra. He was delivering keynote address over video at the C D Deshmukh Memorial Lecture organised online by the Council for Social Development, Hyderabad. Patra said that RBI governor Shaktikanta Das had made 13 pandemic statements and the pandemic response was fashioned around a central anchor, “a leitmotif, if you will, that bound everything into a coherent whole”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/easy-money-approach-has-served-us-well-rbi/articleshow/89190081.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Bad bank takes off, to get₹50,000cr of NPAs in FY22||Mumbai: SBI chairman Dinesh Khara on Friday said that the National Asset Reconstruction Company (NARCL) — the bad bank proposed to take over non-performing loans (NPLs) — has received all approvals to commence operations. He added that 15 loans worth Rs 50,000 crore from banks would be transferred to the NARCL by end of March 2022. These would be out of the NPLs worth Rs 82,425 crore that banks have agreed on.The announcement comes days before the Union Budget and nearly a year after the bad bank was announced by the finance minister in the Budget speech last year. Khara said that the India Debt Resolution Company (IDRCL), the entity that will seek to recover funds from these non-performing assets (NPAs), has also received all the requisite regulatory approvals. “There were certain concerns that were being raised in the media, but I am happy that both the entities have received approval,” said Khara.Introducing the management of the two firms, Khara said that NARCL will be managed by Padma Kumar Nair, while IDRCL will be headed by Manish Makharia. Nair was earlier chief general manager at SBI, while Makharia headed SBI Mutual Fund’s alternate investment funds vertical. SBI’s deputy MD Subroto Biswas will be the chairman of NARCL. Bankers said that earlier Pradip Shah, founder of IndAsia Fund Advisor, was selected for the chairman position at NARCL. Another private sector executive was also shortlisted for the CEO. Khara said while NARCL would be in the public sector, IDRCL will be majorly owned by private sector banks. There are several asset reconstruction companies, but the advantage NARCL would hold is that it would issue security receipts that are guaranteed up to 85% by the government as currency to acquire the bad loans. Khara said that most of the identified bad loans are provided for by banks. This means that they would not need to make additional provisions when they are sold to NARCL at fair value. Also, the security receipts will be considered zero-risk to the extent of the government guarantee and not attract capital requirements.Once the assets are transferred to NARCL, an asset-level trust will be formed for each loan account and the resolution of the account would be handled by IDRCL, which would only be a service company and not hold any assets on its books. In September last year, the government had announced guarantees worth Rs 30,600 crore to security receipts issued by NARCL.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/bad-bank-takes-off-to-get50000cr-of-npas-in-fy22/articleshow/89190082.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Conventional, new eco engines are firing pvt sector, says Birla||MUMBAI: The coming decade will see an upsurge in capital expenditure across many sectors, Aditya Birla Group chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla said in a post on his reflections of the last two years. Birla said the twin-balance sheet problem of stressed loans and over-leveraged corporates is behind us and “we have upon us a forthcoming decade of ‘Capex Mahotsav’ in India”. Birla said a generation of entrepreneurs in India are now taking advantage of the 1991 economic reforms. The private sector, he added, is also firing on two-engines — the conventional and the new-economy. “I call it the ‘Double-engine growth’. Investors are excited about growth prospects in core sectors as well as sunrise sectors. In my view though, the word sunrise sector applies to the entire landscape in India, which includes both conventional sectors like cement, steel, power & auto and emerging areas like digital & renewables. Both hold the promise of high and sustained growth,” said Birla. Birla said there has perhaps rarely been a better time to be an entrepreneur, as everyone from angel investors to the public markets line up to back ideas. “The competition for investment opportunities and the ‘fear of missing out’ (FOMO) have driven up valuations of many fledgling companies to stratospheric levels,” said Birla.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/conventional-new-eco-engines-are-firing-pvt-sector-says-birla/articleshow/89190083.cms||---

---||Mumbai||We’ll conduct Ranji Trophy in two phases: BCCI secy||Mumbai: Almost two years — March 13, 2020 to be precise —after Saurashtra beat Bengal by 44 runs in a thrilling final to clinch the Ranji Trophy at Rajkot, the traditional domestic cricket tournament is set to be back.In a massive relief for hundreds of domestic cricket, umpires, scorers and groundstaff around the country, BCCI secretary Jay Shah announced on Friday stated that the Board will hold the 2021-22 edition of the Ranji Trophy in two phases — the league phase before the IPL, and the knockouts post the glitzy T20 league. “The Board has decided to conduct the Ranji Trophy this season in two phases. In the first phase, we plan to complete all matches of the league stage while the knockouts will be held in June,” Shah said.“My team is working closely to mitigate any kind of health risk caused by the pandemic, while at the same time ensuring a highly competitive red-ball cricket contest. The Ranji Trophy is our most prestigious domestic competition, which has been providing Indian cricket with an enviable talent pool every year. It is absolutely important that we take all necessary steps to safeguard the interest of this premier event,” he said in the statement.On Friday, former India head coach Ravi Shastri had said on social media that the Ranji Trophy is the backbone of Indian cricket and the premier domestic red-ball tournament should not be ignored. “The Ranji Trophy is the backbone of Indian cricket. The moment you start ignoring it, our cricket will be SPINELESS,” tweeted Shastri.TOI had reported on January 23 that the Board was mulling options to hold the league phase of the Ranji Trophy before the IPL, and play the knockouts later.In an email (TOI has a copy) to all the affiliated associations of the BCCI on Friday, Shah wrote: “Dear members, I hope you are doing well. I write to you to apprise you that all the decks have been cleared and we’re set to conduct the Ranji Trophy 2020-21 season shortly. Earlier this month, the Board was forced to postpone India’s premier domestic tournament in the wake of rising Covid-19 cases in the country.“Ever since the decision on the postponement was made, the Board was working on several models to ensure that the tournament takes place as soon as the environment is safe and conducive. As stated in my earlier communication, the hard decision of postponement was done keeping in mind the safety and wellbeing of everyone concerned.”With the daily number of cases having declined, the BCCI was in a better position to conduct the Ranji Trophy, Shah wrote. “The recovery rate has been encouraging across India, we’re now in a much better position to conduct the tournament than earlier. We’ll continue to have bio-secure bubbles to mitigate any potential risk. The Board is committed to providing a healthy and safe environment and seeks your support in ensuring a safe tournament for all our key stakeholders.“My team at the BCCI has worked on a structure where we’ll conduct the Ranji Trophy this season in two phases. The first phase will begin soon and will comprise the league matches, while the knockout leg will be held in the month of June. We’ll shortly convey the details of venues, grouping, and the structure of the two-phased tournament. I thank you all for your understanding and co-operation on the matter. Good luck everyone, let the preparations begin!”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/well-conduct-ranji-trophy-in-two-phases-bcci-secy/articleshow/89190087.cms||---

---||Navi-mumbai||Navi Mumbai: 8 disabled destitute men get leg-up with Jaipur foot||NAVI MUMBAI: When a homeless person, Shivaji Kale (35), was rescued from Panvel three years ago, his right leg was in a pathetic shape with maggots crawling out of his skin. So was the case of Kanak Raj and Gopal Sahu, currently living at SEAL Ashram, New Panvel. Eight such rescued men whose legs had to be earlier amputated have reason to smile as they have been gifted with made-to-order artificial legs (Jaipur foot) so that they can walk again. Senior Navi Mumbai police officials, including zone-2 deputy commissioner Shivraj Patil and ACP Bhagwat Sonawane gave away the new limbs to the inmates at the shelter on Republic Day. Founder of Social and Evangelical Association for Love (SEAL), Pastor K M Philip, told TOI: “We are very pleased that eight of our rescued homeless persons, whose legs had to be amputated after admission to SEAL Ashram, have now been gifted with a Jaipur Foot each. They too are very happy. Due various factors, these men were found in different circumstances in a dazed condition on streets. That is how maggots had infested their leg wounds and blisters.” Philip added: “Amputation can severely affect one’s emotional well-being. Hence, we had worked in the last few weeks to get tailor-made artificial legs for them.” Ashram inmate Kale said with a smile: “I am currently walking with metal support; but soon I will be able to walk like before. I thank our father [pastor] Philip.” “Our SEAL shelter has completed over 22 years in New Panvel, and our primary aim is to find out the home addresses and family details of the rescued homeless people. We have reunited many such people,” said social activist Pastor Biju Mathew. Pastor Philip added: “The state and Union governments must seriously think of a solution or a plan to ensure that mentally imbalanced people are not left to their fate on the streets. These desperately poor people often die as anonymous victims if they are not rescued. Hence, government support is very much required to do this God’s work.” At present, the eight disabled inmates -- Samar Pujara, Kanak Raj, Shivaji Kale, Yogesh Philip, Sanjay Afroz Shaikh, Ankush Philip, Joe Kardai and Gopal Sahu --have no memory of their past. However, efforts are on through psychological counselling to help them reunite with their families.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/navi-mumbai/8-disabled-destitute-men-get-leg-up-with-jaipur-foot/articleshow/89190090.cms||Vijay Singh
---||Navi-mumbai||2.5L got e-challans for violations on Mumbai-Pune e-way last year||Navi Mumbai: As many as 2.55 lakh motorists have been sent e-challans by the Raigad Highway Safety Patrol for traffic violations on the Mumbai-Pune expressway from January till December last year. The maximum traffic violations are of overspeeding beyond the permissible limit of 100kmph on the e-way for which a total of 1.72 lakh motorists have been penalised. The remaining 83,315 traffic violations are of lane cutting, not wearing seatbelt and talking on mobile while driving, among others.Subhash Pujari, assistant police inspector of HSP Palaspe unit, said, “The offenders served e-challans have paid penalty either online or by cash at traffic posts. The total penalty collected from 2.25 lakh offenders is Rs 21.02 crore. From December 2021, the penalty for overspeeding was increased from Rs 2,000 to Rs 4,000 for first-time offenders.” Comparatively, the e-challans served from January to December 2020 were only 74,683, and total penalty recovered was Rs 1.37 crore. Of these, 7,423 violations were of overspeeding and the remaining 67,260 violations were of lane cutting, not wearing seatbelt and talking on mobile while driving, said Pujari.He added, “The decline in cases in 2020 is being attributed to Covid lockdown restrictions, when vehicular movement was comparatively less. However, in 2020, there were 37 fatal accidents between January till December, compared to 34 fatal for the same period in 2021.”API Pujari added, “As per the notification of union ministry of road transport and highways, the maximum speed for 4 lane and above divided carriageway (roads with median strips/dividers) is 100 kmph. Hence, Mumbai-Pune expressway falls under this category. But, as per the notification, no cognizance is taken for speed limit violation under section 183 of the Motor vehicles Act,1988, if the vehicle speed detected is within 5 percent of the maximum speed. Hence, on expressway, the vehicles are allowed to ply till a maximum of 105 kmph and penalty is not imposed on such vehicles. But, beyond that speed limit, the vehicle interceptor detects overspeeding and the vehicle details are captured for sending e-challan to the registered mobile number of the offender motorist.”Also, two CCTV cameras have been installed at two specific undisclosed locations on the expressway between Kalamboli and Khalapur. The cameras capture overspeeding vehicles and their e-challan is generated at the ADGP traffic office at Marine Drive, he said.Bhushan Kumar Upadhyay, ADGP (traffic) said, “We conduct drive against traffic violation not with the intention of generating revenue by imposing penalty on offender motorists, but to ensure that the penal action acts as a deterrent for motorists.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/navi-mumbai/2-5l-got-e-challans-for-violations-on-mumbai-pune-e-way-last-year/articleshow/89190092.cms||---

Experts believe the third wave will be short-lived. The number of daily cases in the NMMC area had reached 2,624 cases, highest ever since the pandemic struck. However, the volume of cases has dipped to under 600 now. The number of cases reported on Thursday and Friday were 546 and 528, respectively. As many as 2,500 people recovered in these two days while four deaths were reported during the period. Moreover, the recoveries are more than the fresh cases recorded in the last few days, bringing some solace to authorities.The number of active cases, too, has gone down to 5,747 from the high of 17,600 recorded a fortnight ago. This is attributed to faster recoveries. It has led to zero occupancy in most of the covid care centres. Around 4,000 patients are home quarantined, as they have mild symptoms while some are asymptomatic. The total death toll has reached 2,007 with three casualties on Friday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/navi-mumbai/528-fresh-cases-nos-continue-to-nosedive/articleshow/89190093.cms||---

Upon reaching the vaccination centre, the senior citizens are inoculated with a booster jab inside the NMMT bus itself and then dropped back home.Dr Kalpesh Sonar, who works at the NMMC’s Nerul urban health centre, said, “Since the Covid vaccine booster dose drive was started by NMMC from January 10, an average of 30-35 senior citizens above 60 years, including those with comorbidity, have been given booster jabs daily at Nerul UHP alone. In 15 days, around 450 senior citizens have been inoculated with booster doses. Senior citizens, who are fully vaccinated and have completed nine months after being inoculated with the second dose, are being contacted. Accordingly, senior citizens who have difficulty in walking and do not have their own vehicle to travel are shortlisted and provided the transport facility by NMMT’s special bus service to reach vaccination centres in their area.”Dr Pankaj Tidar, in-charge of NMMC’s vaccination centre at Nerul UHP, said, “Bringing a group of senior citizens by NMMT bus till vaccination centre makes it easier even for the civic medical team to give jabs to multiple elderly persons at one go. Also, they do not have to alight from the bus. After inoculation, all of them are monitored by the doctor for 30 minutes before they are dropped back to their respective residences.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/navi-mumbai/spl-buses-for-elderly-offer-pick-up-jab-drop-services/articleshow/89190095.cms||---

---||Navi-mumbai||Navi Mumbai to see more native, fruit-bearing trees||Navi Mumbai: Nature lovers have recommended the civic body to take a relook at its tree policy and promote native, fruit-bearing species for wider benefit. NMMC commissioner Abhijit Bangar has taken cognizance of the suggestions and directed his subordinates to take it forward. NMMC will now plant more native trees than ornamental ones across the city, with an exception to road dividers. NMMC chief Bangar said he is in favour of native plants which can attract more birds and the city will see more such plants in the coming days.Speaking to TOI, Bangar said “I am in favour of native plants which can attract more birds. The fruit-bearing trees will cater to the needs of birds’ nutrition. Besides, they are sustainable even in worst climatic conditions and have longer life which benefits the environment. We will have more such plants in the city in the coming days with the ongoing campaign of creating a social urban forest.”Most of the buildings and societies have been opting for either decorative or fast-growing trees which do not stand even a mild wind blow, said activist B N Kumar. While issuing occupancy certificates, NMMC insists on tree plantation in the new building premises, but not much attention is paid on the types or species to be planted nor is there any follow-up on implementation of that provision, complained environmentalists.  A nature lover, Sudhakar Kamble said, “NMMC should plant a variety of native fruit bearing trees that attract birds and support biodiversity, depending on the soil and water, and not mere decorative plants such as Gulmohur.”Kumar called for getting soil tests done through an institution such as the Konkan Krushi Vidyapeeth, and developing NMMC nursery to supply saplings at a nominal cost to housing societies and developers. “Occupation certificates issued by NMMC need to have a provision to review if the planted saplings are properly maintained,” said a resident Ravi Kiran.Initially, Cidco had planned various roads with names of different trees -- Palm Beach, Jambul and Neem — and the policy could be reviewed to check what it has achieved. Residents are of the view that the elected representatives should be made accountable for the environment, citing the Indore example of corporators taking responsibility for cleanliness and Swachh Bharat drive in their respective wards.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/navi-mumbai/navi-mumbai-to-see-more-native-fruit-bearing-trees/articleshow/89190098.cms||---

Despite the financial crisis arising out of floods and health emergencies due to Covid, the CM said his government has been compassionate and responsive by extending a helping hand to all sections of society, including farmers and students. “We spent a whopping Rs 24,000 crore on development in Covid times. We almost doubled compensation for crop loss, benefiting over 14 lakh farmers. We have also increased monthly pension of elderly persons, widows and the differently abled by Rs 200 per month, which has helped 58 lakh people. Over 4.5 lakh children of farmers have benefited by Raith Vidya Nidhi programme. Every single decision this government has taken in the last six months is aimed at the welfare of people, and there has not been an iota of self-interest. I am proud about it,” Bommai said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/govt-seeks-isec-assistance-to-assess-impact-of-policies/articleshow/89190128.cms||---

Managing director Varun Berry said the rural markets across FMCG witnessed significant slowdown. But Britannia, he said, was able to maintain a significant competitive advantage through its focus on enhancing the rural footprint. "On the cost front, we continued to witness increase in commodity prices with an inflation of about 4% sequentially and about 20% over last year. As market leaders, we actioned price increases ahead of competition. However, the upward trajectory in prices of commodities and fuel impacted profitability, which led us to action further price increases and accelerate cost efficiency programmes," he said.

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Stop delay of trains, open MV terminal, say passengers||BENGALURU: Passengers travelling to and from Bengaluru have been complaining about frequent train delays. For instance, the 22680 Hassan-Yeshwantpur train, which was scheduled to reach Yeshwantpur at 10.10am on Thursday, was delayed by 51 minutes and arrived only at 11:01am. On Friday, the train was late by 32 minutes. While South Western Railway (SWR) officials said some trains are getting delayed because of congestion and non-availability of platforms at KSR Bengaluru City and Yeshwantpur stations, passengers cite the yet-to-be inaugurated Sir M Visvesvaraya (Sir MV) terminal at Byappanahalli as the solution. On the delay of 22680 Hassan-Yeshwantpur intercity superfast express, a railway official said trains are getting delayed between Chikkabanavara and Yeshwantpur. Shashank, a passenger, said: “SWR should maintain the punctuality of Hassan-Yeshwantpur train for the benefit of Hassan passengers. Many have stopped relying on it because of frequent delays.” Another passenger said: “Mysuru-Kochuveli Express takes 1 hour and 35 mins to cover 12km from Kengeri to KSR Bengaluru City. One can cover the same distance on foot in less than 1.5 hours!” Bengaluru divisional railway manager Shyam Singh was unavailable for comments. KN Krishna Prasad, founder-member of Karnataka Railway Vedike, said: “Opening Sir MV terminal will help decongest Yeshwantpur, but it is not being inaugurated even though it has been ready since March 2021. Several east-bound trains (Howrah) could shift to the new terminal.” He said many trains are delayed at Yeshwantpur because of the crisscrossing of goods trains. Track availability Kiran, another passenger, said: “The main problem is congestion and non-availability of tracks at Yeshwantpur station. Sir MV railway terminal would have taken some load off Yeshwantpur and reduced congestion. But railways doesn’t seem to be interested in opening it soon.” Many passengers said trains like 17211 Kondaveedu Express (Machilipatnam-Yeshwantpur), Yeshwantpur-Hazrat Nizamuddin (Karnataka Sampark Kranti Express), Golgumbaz Express (16535 Mysuru-Solapur Junction), 06292 Kuppam-KSR Bengaluru, 16596 Karwar-KSR Bengaluru City, 17236 Nagercoil-KSR Bengaluru, 16217 Mysuru-Sainagar Shirdi, 11311 Solapur-Hassan Express, and 07316 Salem- Yeshwantpur are often delayed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/passengers-stop-delay-of-trains-open-mv-terminal/articleshow/89190141.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Iconic image from World War II being replicated in Padmanabhanagar park||BENGALURU: One of World War II’s most iconic images — Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima — is being replicated in Bengaluru. The Pulitzer Prize-winning photograph by Joe Rosenthal is one of the most recognised visuals exemplifying US victory in the war. Now, a new park coming up at Deve Gowda Petrol Bunk Junction (officially Kittur Rani Chennamma Circle) in Padmanabhanagar, has a larger-than-life replica depicting four soldiers hoisting a flag — on the lines of United States Marine Corps War Memorial at Arlington, Virginia. Only the finishing touches and painting works are pending at the city park. While the original image is of six American soldiers hoisting the star-spangled US flag atop Mount Suribachi, the Bengaluru version will showcase the Indian tricolour. Even the soldiers are suitably modified to look more Indian. The idea for a park, which is to be named after the late Chief of Defence Staff Bipin Rawat, came from revenue minister R Ashoka, who happens to be the local MLA. It is being constructed on 1 acre and 5 guntas of land recovered from illegal encroachment. Mahantesh Buranpur, BBMP executive engineer (projects-south), said the project was approved four months ago and will be completed in the next 10 days. “This park is the brainchild of minister Ashoka. He helped us retrieve and take possession of the encroached land and decided to get a park built there,” he said. The park has a walking area of 300m, 30 granite benches, a gazebo, and a dedicated area for senior citizens with gym equipment. The total cost is Rs 2 crore, with Rs 15 lakh being spent by the horticulture department. A park at this place wasn’t the only proposal. BBMP officials said senior JD(S) leaders mooted construction of an old-age home on the recovered land, but the government turned down the idea. The BBMP executive engineer, however, said the decision to build a park was a unanimous one. “On retrieving the land, we had a public consultation, wherein everybody proposed a park. It was only after the sad demise of General Bipin Rawat that the name of the park was decided,” said Buranpur. On who suggested the idea of replicating the famous US war image, Buranpur said it was a private contractor and a close aide of Ashoka; sculptor Manju Mahesh was roped in to design it. The 1945 photograph was replicated as a sculpture at the United States Marine Corps War Memorial in 1954, dedicated to all US soldiers who fought for America since the 18th century. Mahesh and his team took two months to complete the concrete sculpture. “We are a team of eight who worked relentlessly for eight hours over two months to finish this setup. The armature work took most of our time, followed by drying of concrete,” he said. Though the move to reclaim the encroached land and convert it into a park has been largely appreciated, one question being raised is: “Why are we doing a replica of a US war memorial with an Indian flag, instead of coming up with something original?”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/iconic-image-from-world-war-ii-being-replicated-in-padmanabhanagar-park/articleshow/89190146.cms||Nithya Mandyam
---||Bengaluru||Preschools demand clarity on NEP norms||Bengaluru: Even as they wait for the National Education Policy (NEP) framework for primary education, independent preschools in the city face a new dilemma over their expansion plans. Preschool owners say they are unable to take decisions because of uncertainty over the new rules.NEP-2020 recommends a 5+3+3+4 structure to schooling, with children spending five years in the foundational stage starting from 3-8 years. “With this, we don’t know whether preschools that run till upper kindergarten can start classes 1-2 as well. If so, will it result in a change of licence for us? Will we be able to run these classes in the space that we currently have? Will there be a change in educational qualifications for our teachers? All these will depend on the rules the state will lay out. Until we know them, we cannot open a new branch,” said Pruthvi Banawasi, chairperson of Karnataka State Council of Preschools. According to owners, there is uncertainty with admissions when it comes to the age of a child. “I am taking consent letters from parents that my preschool will not be responsible for the class children have joined in case there are changes to rules. Until the rules are out, we are not sure of the minimum age for a child to join class 1,” said Renu Deshpande, founder of Zool Kids, which runs three preschools and a daycare centre in south Bengaluru. “While NEP speaks of ECCE (early childhood care and education) from the age of three, we usually start inducting children from the age of 2.5. There is no clarity on what happens to that group of children,” said Sandhya Prithvi, founder, Rainbow Creations. “Even during Covid lockdowns, neither the education department nor the women and child welfare department issued guidelines for us. We need some clarity on NEP soon so that we can start planning the way forward. I have stalled my plan to open another branch until then,” she added. The NEP dilemma has come as a double whammy for preschools as they have been incurring huge losses due to lockdowns since 2020. Many gave up their rented space, shifted infrastructure to godowns, and were slowly building back their schools when they were asked to close again in January. At present, 26 position papers are being prepared by various committees on different aspects of NEP. Sources in the group said these questions will be addressed in the position papers. Preschools asked the government to provide them in public domain as soon as possible to understand the framework.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/preschools-demand-clarity-on-nep-norms/articleshow/89190148.cms||---

As the first step, 30 lecturers attended a workshop with IIM-A faculty where the premier institution tried to find out the problems faced by them at the grassroots level. The workshop was conducted on January 25 and 26 virtually. Based on suggestions of the lecturers, IIM-A will submit a report on the interventions needed. “The workshop was called ‘Reforming school systems’. The selected lecturers and principals discussed multiple issues and how to tackle them. In future, we will have some workshops and certificate programmes designed to address these issues,” said Snehal R, director, DPUE. “Most of the decisions that have been made are from the top of the hierarchy. They have not impacted the quality of education to the level we wanted. That is when we decided to conduct a workshop with lecturers on what the issues are.” The lecturers’ suggestions included refresher courses, in-service training for principals, multi-level monitoring system as in the department of public instruction, and motivational sessions. The lecturers pointed out that they are overburdened with many tasks apart from academic work. They suggested regular assessment of students, reduction of classroom: teacher ratio to give better attention to students, and use of technology in teaching. “These interventions are likely to work as they’ve come from the lecturers themselves. It is a bottom-up approach. IIM will help us implement them across the state,” Snehal said. “This is the first step in a long-term association with IIM-A. We can also look at signing an MoU with government permission to conduct multiple programmes, including certification programmes for lecturers.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/pu-dept-seeks-iim-a-help-to-improve-quality-of-education/articleshow/89190152.cms||---

Some members of the gang posed as income tax officials and took away Rs 3.5 lakh cash and two air pistols. The accused are Manjunath, a sub-editor with Kannada tabloid Aarakshaka Suddi and a resident of Sanjayanagar, and his associates Mohammed Syed Rabbani, Kumar, Dharmesh alias Rudresh,\ and Prashanth alias Jayanth, all real estate brokers.

---||Bengaluru||Person with false caste certificate can’t be prosecuted, says Karnataka HC||BENGALURU: If a false caste certificate is obtained by persons not belonging to scheduled caste/scheduled tribe by giving wrong information, they cannot be prosecuted under provisions of Section 3(1)(ix) of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, the high court said in a recent judgment. “If a false caste certificate is obtained by persons not belonging to SC/ST by giving wrong information, it does not mean that a public servant is induced to take action against them. The said provision cannot be invoked in the chargesheet even if it is assumed for argument sake that certificates are obtained by giving false information. In this view, filing of chargesheet against the petitioners was unwarranted,” justice Sreenivas Harish Kumar observed in his order. He allowed the petitions filed by two women and also discharged them of the offence under Section 3(1)(ix) of the Act. The judge noted that the Atrocities Act came into force only from January 30,1990 and added that Article 20(1) of the Constitution clearly states that no person should be convicted of any offence except for violation of law in force at the time of commission of the act charged as an offence, nor be subjected to a penalty greater than that which might have been inflicted under the law in force at the time of commission of the offence. Petitioners Yamuna and Vijaya, both from Mangaluru, had challenged the proceedings initiated against them before a special court in Dakshina Kannada district for the offence under Section 3(1)(ix) of the Act. They were sought to be prosecuted for the said offence on the allegation that they produced false caste certificates to show that they belonged to Marathi caste, which comes under Scheduled Tribe category, so as to secure a job in New Mangalore Port Trust. On August 22, 2012, the trial court dismissed their applications seeking discharge from the case. The petitioners claimed the caste certificates were issued in 1977 and 1983, respectively and added that when those certificates were issued, the Act wasn’t in existence. It was enacted in 1989 and hence it wasn’t an offence at the relevant time. They further contended that the wrongdoing alleged against them doesn’t come within the purview of Section 3(1)(ix).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/person-with-false-caste-cert-cant-be-prosecuted-says-hc/articleshow/89190158.cms||Vasantha Kumar

Saying they have set up 136 EV charging stations — 106 AC and 30 DC chargers — in Bengaluru, in line with EV and energy storage policy, officials said the plan is to expand the current network. “A total of 63 stations will be set up in eight Bescom districts on premises owned by the utility,” an official said. Karnataka has 2.7 crore vehicles, including 81,193 electric ones. Records show the number of EVs in the state increasing over the years, from 6,454 (in 2019) to 9,731 (in 2020) to 33,302 (in 2021). A total of 3,544 EVs have been registered in the state this year so far. The charging stations will come up in Bengaluru Urban (10 locations), Bengaluru Rural (21), Ramanagara (7), Tumakuru (6), Kolar (7), Chikkaballapur (6), Davanagere (2) and Chitradurga (4). In Bengaluru Urban, places such as Banashankari 2nd Stage, Uttarahalli hobli, Bannerghatta Road, Rajarajeshwari Nagar, Bheemajyothi Layout near West of Chord Road, Kaggalipura and Kengeri hobli will get these charging stations. In the 2021-22 state budget, Bescom had proposed to set up more than 1,000 EV charging stations across Karnataka under PPP model. “The selected firms will establish, operate and maintain them for 126 months at these locations,” another official said. “The firms can install more units based on space availability and demand. Further, a maximum of one battery-swapping facility/kiosk can be installed based on demand/requirement.” Bescom officials said the Karnataka EV policy envisages making Bengaluru the EV capital of India, besides attracting investments to the tune of Rs 31,000 crore and creating 55,000 new jobs by 2022. Many EV owners have welcomed the move. “More stations will encourage more motorists to shift to environment-friendly, battery-run vehicles. Steps should be taken to set up charging infrastructure on highways. Bescom should install more signboards on roadsides about charging units so that motorists are able to use them,” said Abhishek S, an EV owner from Koramangala. Bescom’s plan is to have a charging station every 5km in the city. EV users can download ‘Electree Fi’ app to locate the nearest facility, reserve a slot, and pay for charging session through cashless mode.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/bescom-to-set-up-63-more-ev-charging-stations/articleshow/89190163.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

---||Bengaluru||India seek consistency||Bengaluru: In the world of sports where bio-bubbles, constant Covid-19 testing and tournament behind closed doors have become the norm, the functioning of teams, focus and planning have seen a lateral shift. In the two years of the pandemic, one of the key learnings has been coping and tackling the issues that come with the virus. Indian men’s hockey team’s chief coach Graham Reid believes the team has grasped the coping mechanism. wellThe national team will put this mechanism to the test during the busy season. Starting with the FIH Pro League contest in South Africa next week, the Manpreet Singh-led team will criss-cross the world with major competitions like the Commonwealth Games, Asian Games and the Asia Cup in the pipeline. “I've been going through more plans Bs & Cs than ever before. But over time we have learnt to get used to it (bio-bubble and Covid-19 cases). We can't change what happens, but you can change how you react to it. We have learnt to accept and move on. Our selections have been tweaked and we try to make it flexible with backups for each position. Also, we have been doing things like we don't room goalkeepers together. The players also have developed their own strategies of keeping themselves occupied and refreshed in isolation during camps and travel,” said the Australian during a virtual presser on Friday.After the high of the bronze medal at the Tokyo Olympics, India failed to defend the Asian Champions Trophy title, losing in the semifinals last month. Dwelling on the 3-5 loss to Japan, Reid pointed out, “All of us hated that semifinal loss to Japan. No one likes to experience something like that. But you have to experience that to learn from it. My message to the team after the tournament was: ‘This is what happens if we don't treat every game with the utmost importance.’ Following a clutch of retirements including that of dragflick ace Rupinder Pal Singh after the Olympics, India will test new faces like Jugraj Singh and Abhishek in South Africa where they play back-to-back Pro League legs against the hosts and France. Speaking about the debutants, Reid said, “Jugraj is a versatile player who can play in both midfield and defence. His drag-flicks are quick. Abhishek is a strong youngster and a prolific scorer.”Skipper Manpreet, stressed on the need to perform consistently, given the hectic season ahead. “This is an important year and the Pro League is a good opportunity to test ourselves especially with two youngsters coming into the side. We want to start on a winning note and make good progress through the year,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/india-seek-consistency/articleshow/89190167.cms||Manuja Veerappa

Parks, however, saw higher footfall towards the evening. There are almost half-a-dozen major temples in the city which come under the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments department. Number of devotees who visited the temples was less on the first day of reopening, compared to a normal Friday. These temples are mostly visited by tourists. Generally, temples remain crowded on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, said an official. As the announcement of reopening temples and parks came only on Thursday night, many devotees would have already made plan for the next day, said an official. Only those who saw the announcement came to visit the temples during the day. Temples are opened at 6am and are closed by noon during the first half. Again, they remain open from 4pm-9pm, said an official. The Children's Park and the Snake Park in Guindy saw an increase in visitors during the second half of the day. Chennai wildlife warden E Prasant said till 1pm not many visitors came to the Children's Park. Only after 2pm, the crowd started swelling.

After a requisition was placed by the Greater Chennai Traffic police for installing the lights on the flyover citing safety issues, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) sanctioned 20 lights to be installed. The flyover did not have any light since its inauguration. The stretch remained dark at night, only being illuminated by the high-beam car lights. Chennai Airport Flyover is a 1.6-km-long three-laned flyover for one-way traffic from Pallavaram to Alandur. It was built by the NHAI at a cost of ₹98 crore and inaugurated in 2008. It was built to ease congestion on Grand Southern Trunk Road. Police sources said that installation of lights was a long-term demand from motorists, who found it difficult to cross the stretch during late night. Officials said that lights could not be installed so far as high-mast lights would hinder flight movement, as it was very close to the airport. "We have planned to install dim lights at minimal height, so that they don’t affect aircraft operations at the airport," said a highway official. "This has been done after consultation with the police and airport officials. Though not many accidents have taken place on the flyover, these lights will prevent accidents from happening," said a senior traffic official from St Thomas Mount traffic wing. "This is a welcoming move. Though the well-lit airport is close-by, senior citizens find it difficult to drive in the dark," said Padmanaban, a resident of Nanganallur.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/airport-flyover-to-be-illuminated-for-1st-time/articleshow/89190173.cms||---

Justice N Anand Venkatesh rejected the plea in view of an archaic arbitration clause added in agreements between the government and private contractors that arbitration will be resorted to only if the value of the dispute was less than ₹50,000. “If the arbitration clause had not restricted the value of the claims, without any hesitation, this court would have allowed this application and referred the parties for arbitration,” the judge said. However, the arbitration clause itself stipulates that for claims above ₹50,000 it is only the jurisdictional civil court at Chennai, which will have the jurisdiction to decide the dispute, the court pointed out. While dealing with this issue, it was held by the Supreme Court that the existence of an arbitration agreement must be decided on the basis of the terms of the agreement and on a plain reading of the clause, the court said. The judge added that if the arbitration clause restricts the value of the claim which can be referred to the arbitrator, only those claims which fall within the value can be referred for adjudication by the arbitrator, the judge added. “Before drawing the curtains, this court wants to impress upon the authorities to revamp the entire arbitration clause. Obviously, there is a total non-application of mind on the part of the authorities…” the court said. If the authorities had applied their mind and had not acted in a mechanical fashion, they would not have fixed the value as ridiculous as ₹50,000 and this dispute would not have landed in this court, the court said while marking a copy of the order to the chief secretary for necessary action.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/cant-refer-govt-dispute-with-builder-to-arbitration-hc/articleshow/89190177.cms||---

Though the actor paid the entry tax, he had moved the court challenging the 400% penalty imposed for delayed payment of the tax. Justice C Saravanan passed the oral instruction while tagging the plea to a batch of similar matters. The court then adjourned the hearing to February 1. According to the petitioner, he imported the car from the US in 2005 for his personal use as at that point of time there were no direct dealerships of the brand in the country. As the registering authorities refused registration without payment of entry tax, the actor moved the court and obtained an order in his favour. The issue regarding the power of a state to impose entry tax was pending consideration before the court at that point of time. Subsequently, the petitioner sold the car to a third party in 2009. However, the authorities passed an order calling upon the actor to pay Rs 7.98 lakh as entry tax and Rs 30.23 lakhs as penalty for the delay in remitting the tax. Aggrieved, the petitioner has moved the present plea.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/hc-curbs-on-sales-tax-action-against-vijay/articleshow/89190180.cms||---

The panel, which was constituted by the NGT to study illegal sand mining near Napier Bridge, said that only maintenance work was taken up by the PWD to prevent flooding and it did not cause any ecological damage. The committee, which had representatives from the Union environment ministry, TN Coastal Zone Management Authority, PWD, the city police and the collector, had inspected the estuary in October 2021 and January. During their site visit, the committee members noticed that vehicles such as JCB excavators were deployed for removing accumulated sand bars — a common occurrence during every monsoon season —to regularise tidal flow conditions. Even though the committee observed that no clearance for dredging had been taken from the authorities concerned, it did not suggest any action against this. However, it has recommended action against vehicles, which are parked unnecessarily in this area, and directed police to maintain the record of all vehicles entering the eco-sensitive zone (Coastal Regulatory Zone-IA) through Anna Square bus stand. Police on its behalf told the tribunal that they already have installed CCTV surveillance cameras and sought more support from the collector regarding this. An eight-member police team has been posted at the spot to keep a vigil round the clock to prevent illegal activities, said the joint commissioner of GCP (East Zone). The tribunal posted the next hearing of the case on January 31.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/ngt-panels-report-no-sand-mining-at-cooum-river-mouth/articleshow/89190182.cms||---

School-going children who are now attending classes through online mode will be deprived of their regular classes by disconnection of electricity.”Moreover, it would dampen the morale of the children, he added. “Since the current academic years ends in April, we request the court to permit us to complete the eviction process by April 30,” Ravindran said.Pointing out that the authorities have already disconnected electricity connections to 192 commercial buildings and seven compound walls erected around empty lands have been demolished and land retrieved, AAG Ravindran wanted the court to extend the time for evicting residential buildings alone.“In the first phase, 100 families who have given undertaking to evict will be provided alternative accommodation in the tenements built by the Tamil Nadu Urban Habitat Development Board before March 31,” he said.In the second phase, 1,348 families of encroacher will be provided alternative accommodation before April 30.

The corporation, however, did not lodge any police complaint, though an inquiry had been conducted in the matter and a report submitted to Commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi. Instead, they have sent the engineer on leave and he is in his home town now. It was at 1.30am on Wednesday that Tiruvottriyur MLA and four of his associates landed at Natarajan Garden First Street and beat up the assistant engineer overseeing a road laying work. TOI reported the incident on Friday. Within hours, DMK general secretary Durai Murugan initiated disciplinary action against Shankar and removed him from Tiruvottriyur (west) zonal secretary post saying the MLA had been violating the party discipline. On their part, the Chennai Corporation Contractors Association has also sent a representation to the corporation commissioner seeking action against the MLA. The regional deputy commissioner, north, M Sivaguru Prabhakaran told TOI that they had collected the statements from officials and sent it to the corporation commissioner for further action.

After years of delay, the PWD and revenue department demolished 14 of the 403 houses constructed illegally on the Chitlalapakkam lake. On the other hand, five people were arrested for selling government land in Injambakkam. Based on the complaint of Sholinganallur tahsildar Manisekar, the Neelankarai police registered a fresh case and arrested the five. An investigation officer said, “We are searching for a few more people involved in the racket. Many people had paid them money and illegally registered plots in their names.” Following a high court order on January 24, the revenue officials have begun retrieving 164 acres of wetland in Injambakkam where more than 5,000 people were staying. In Chitlapakkam, the PWD officials faced stiff resistance from the encroachers. “Despite resistance but we are committed to finishing the drive in the next 25 days,” said PWD assistant engineer Prabhu, in charge of the drive. The PWD is set to reclaim about 20 acres of lake land. Both shanties and big apartments were demolished during the drive. It is unlikely that the evicted residents would be given alternate housing as some of them are affluent while others are tenants. “All the housing board quarters nearby are full. We have to check the availability,” Prabhu said. Both the drives come after a strong message from the high court to save the water bodies in the state. Activists welcomed the drives. “The Chitlapakkam lake restoration will now be a model for other lakes. However, there are very marginalised people living here. Their livelihood is dependent on the locality and the government can give them alternative accommodation in the vicinity,” said Sunil Jayaraman of Chitlapakkam Rising NGO.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/nudged-by-hc-govt-cracks-down-on-encroachments/articleshow/89190186.cms||---

Carrying the bloodstained hammer, the woman surrendered before the Otteri police station in the wee hours of Friday. The Otteri police registered a case under Section 302 (murder) of IPC and detained the woman for questioning. Police let her off after further investigation. “The investigation officers preferred not to arrest the woman as she killed her husband to rescue her daughter,” said Pulianthope deputy commissioner of police I Eswaran. Police said the woman, a native of Kerala, had been living with her husband and her in-laws as a joint family for the past two decades. Her father-in-law, a tailor, had settled in the city at least five decades ago and owned a few houses in Otteri. Neither the woman nor her husband was employed and their daughter, studying in a college in the city, and son, studying in Class VI are being raised by the man's parents. While the girl often stayed with her grandparents, on Thursday night she slept with her parents as her grandparents were away at a relative’s house. While the woman, her husband and son were sleeping on the cot, their daughter slept on the floor. In the wee hours, the woman woke up on hearing the cries of her daughter and saw her husband trying to force himself on their daughter. The woman and her young son tried to drag the man away from his daughter, but he pushed them away. The woman then grabbed a hammer lying nearby and hit her husband repeatedly on the head, killing him. Following this, she surrendered before the police station and informed them that she had murdered her husband. Otteri inspector of police Johnny Chellappa formally booked her on murder charges but then set her free as she had acted in self-defence. The investigation officers said they would gather all the substantial evidence and witnesses to prove that the woman killed her husband in self defence. “We will submit a detailed final report before the court after collecting the evidence and witness statements,” said DCP Eswaran.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/woman-kills-hubby-to-save-daughter/articleshow/89190188.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Registration rush in Telangana as hiked fees set to kick in on February 1||HYDERABAD: The government's plan to enhance market value of properties from February 1 has resulted in a heavy rush for registrations at all sub-registrar and tahsildar offices in the state in the past few days. Though some realtors and developers have urged the state government to postpone the revision as it would adversely impact them, the government is unlikely to accept the demand. The proposal for enhanced rates has already been readied by the registration department as per the state government's order last week and data is being uploaded on Dharani portal. The government may shut the Dharani portal on January 31, a day before the new rates come into effect. The rush to avoid paying hiked rates, however, has led to jamming of Dharani portal which has been witnessing technical glitches for the past five days. "I have been trying to register my agriculture land at Kondapaka mandal in Siddipet for the past few days and a slot was also booked on January 21. But the property is not getting registered due to technical glitches," said Vamshidhar from Dilsukhnagar. Official sources too said there was a significant jump in registration in the past two days. "During normal days, registrations hover around 4,000 to 5,000 a day and revenue collection at Rs 40 to Rs 45 crore. But for the past couple of days, the number of registrations jumped to 11,000 and revenue increased to about Rs 100-110 crore a day," registrations and stamps department commissioner V Sheshadri told TOI. According to sources, people have been queuing up in surrounding districts such as Medchal-Ranga Reddy, Sangareddy, Siddipet and Yadadri as the government is proposing more hike in these areas. There are also allegations against staff at the sub-registrar and mandal offices for creating problems in registrations and making money using this opportunity. "How many days will the state government claim there are glitches in Dharani portal," a property owner asked. The registration and stamps department officials, however, said the portal faced glitches only on Thursday and there was no problem on Friday. "The portal may be witnessing problems due to load on server as many people are trying at the same time to book slots," a district registrar said. While agriculture land is registered at tahsildar offices, non-agriculture property transactions are recorded at 141 sub-registrar offices.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/registration-rush-in-t-as-hiked-fees-set-to-kick-in-on-feb-1/articleshow/89190196.cms||Koride Mahesh

---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Alliance with BJP remains “as of now”, says AIADMK||CHENNAI: Even as filing of nominations begins in Tamil Nadu for urban local bodies, the AIADMK-BJP alliance remains a talking point. The AIADMK on Friday maintained that the alliance with the BJP continues “as of now,” while the state unit of the BJP said that its core committee had delegated the authority to decide on alliances to its president K Annamalai. Annamalai is likely to make an announcement on continuing the alliance on Saturday morning, upon receiving a word from the party’s national leadership. The BJP functionaries at the party meeting on Friday were divided over continuing alliance with the AIADMK.  AIADMK coordinator O Panneerselvam and joint coordinator Edappadi K Palaniswami held a meeting with the senior leaders and functionaries at the party headquarters on the alliance and preparedness. “Our alliance with the BJP continues as of now. They (BJP) have to approach our party high command regarding seats. An appropriate decision will be taken by our leaders when they approach,” AIADMK steering committee member and former minister C Ve Shanmugam said. The AIADMK high command has also given instructions to its district functionaries to make local adjustments with allies when they approach for seats. Allies, P Sivagami of Samuga Samathuva Padai and M Jagan Moorthy of Puratchi Bharatham dropped in AIADMK headquarters to extend support. G K Vasan’s TMC, another ally, has been engaged in talks at the district-level.  The AIADMK’s ‘wait and watch’ also comes against the backdrop of the acerbic remarks made by BJP floor leader and former AIADMK minister, Nainar Nagendran against the AIADMK during the recent protest. Nagendran said the AIADMK “lacked spine and manliness” in the assembly. A section in the AIADMK is against continuing the alliance with the BJP, citing hostility of minorities.  Emerging from a meeting at their party headquarters, BJP senior leader and former Union minister Pon Radhakrishnan told reporters that the party was prepared for anything. “Annamalai has been authorized to decide on alliances,” Radhakrishnan said. BJP TN co-incharge P Sudhakar Reddy told TOI that AIADMK was part of the NDA and the BJP shared a cordial relationship with NDA allies.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/alliance-with-bjp-remains-as-of-now-says-aiadmk/articleshow/89190200.cms||Julie Mariappan

---||Chennai||Steel price hikes pinch margins of tractor cos: Crisil||Chennai: The tractor market's dream run may hit a roadblock due to a sharp increase in raw material prices, primarily steel. According to a latest report by Crisil Ratings, operating profitability of tractor makers is set to shrink by 300-400 basis points (bps) this fiscal due to this. Flat sales will not help matters much either. The good news is the credit profiles of tractor makers will remain stable, supported by almost debt-free balance sheets and good liquidity, said the analysis. Tractor companies had seen operating margins expand by 400-450 bps to 18%-19% in fiscal 2021 because of a better product mix, a shift towards higher horsepower (HP) tractors, lower raw material cost (especially in the first half) and curtailment of discretionary expenses such as advertising, discounts and administrative costs. This fiscal, prices of key raw materials such as steel and pig iron (75%-80% of total cost) have risen 35%-40% year-on-year in the first nine months and discretionary costs are back to normal,”said the report. Despite the decline, operating margin will still remain healthy at 15%-16% ‘in line with the pre pandemic levels’. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/steel-price-hikes-pinch-margins-of-tractor-cos-crisil/articleshow/89190202.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: 77% Covid cases in cities but over 40% deaths in villages||AHMEDABAD: From January 1 to 28, Gujarat recorded three lakh Covid cases at a daily average of 10,752. Eight major cities accounted for 2.26 lakh or 77% of the cases. The cities included Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara, Rajkot, Bhavnagar, Jamnagar, Junagadh and Gandhinagar. Ironically, villages accounted for 42% of the deaths while 149 of the 257 deaths or 58% were recorded from these cities. Thus, while the eight cities' mortality rate was 0.07% or one death per 700 cases, the rest of Gujarat recorded a mortality rate of 0.15% or one death per 150 cases, or about four times higher. "Majority of the deaths outside eight municipal corporations have been recorded in Rajkot, Valsad, Jamnagar and Navsari districts, among others. Vaccination has emerged as a major factor as over 40% of the persons who have succumbed to the Covid infection had not taken either one or both doses," said a senior state health department official. "Another factor is comorbidities and age-related complications – about 70% are above 60 years of age and out of total, over 60% had comorbidities. Mortality below 40 years is very less." Meanwhile, Gujarat on Friday recorded deaths of 30 active patients – the highest in the past eight months. On May 27 last year, Gujarat had recorded 33 deaths. Out of 30 deaths, 60% were recorded in eight major cities – 7 from Ahmedabad, 4 from Rajkot, 3 from Vadodara, 2 from Bhavnagar, and 1 each from Surat and Jamnagar cities. The rest were from other areas of the state. City-based experts said that it would take some time to understand the genetic make-up of the prevalent virus – while the Omicron variant is dominant in the population, Delta is still present albeit in minority, they said. P4, 6 & 12They added that for the past few days, with the overall rise in numbers, the number of patients on ventilators and in ICU are also rising in proportion. On Friday, 297 active patients were on ventilators, or about 0.3% of 1.07 lakh active patients. Gujarat in 24 hours recorded 12,131 new cases, the third consecutive day of drop in daily cases.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/77-covid-cases-in-cities-but-over-40-deaths-in-villages/articleshow/89190222.cms||Parth Shastri

When they ask for money, they should disclose how much has already been released,” he said.Prabhakar said the TRS was making baseless charges against the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre despite the fact that Congress-led UPA government had never released funds when the state was united.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/release-whitepaper-oncentral-fundsto-t-says-bjp/articleshow/89190225.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Separate homefor child bridessoon: T to HC||Hyderabad: The state government is planning to set up an exclusive home for victims of child marriages and extend various types of services to them in a comprehensive manner.The state women and child welfare department informed this to the Telangana high court on Friday. Department’s director Viziendira Boyi filed an affidavit before the court to this effect. She filed the affidavit in response to a direction given by the high court which sought the government’s response to a letter written by B Mahalatha and 10 others who brought to the notice of the court the miserable conditions of girls locked in such marriages.Though the high court had earlier directed the state to consider providing 5% reservation to such girls in educational institutions, the director of child welfare, in her affidavit, said a policy decision will be taken by the state.“As far as we are concerned, we can get them admitted to state-run residential schools and Durga Bai Deshmukh Polytechnic College in Hyderabad,” she said. “Except for providing the reservations, we have taken several steps in tune with HC directions to help the girls cope with the crisis,” state’s special counsel A Sanjeev Kumar said. The suggestion to provide 3% reservation in jobs cannot be given as that would amount to incentivising child marriages, the director said in her affidavit. The letter by Mahalatha and others narrated the woes of the child brides who were forced into marriages and were dying during pregnancies and deliveries. Even if they survive, they suffer from several health complications and give birth to children afflicted with various ailments. As there were no protection homes run by the state to take care of such girls, they are forced to stay put with their families and facing abuse and ill-treatment. The Supreme Court had also directed the states and the high courts to accord priority to welfare of such victims. The bench asked the state government to consider providing some quantum of reservations for such girls and closed the PIL.Hyderabad: The state government is planning to set up an exclusive home for victims of child marriages and extend various types of services to them in a comprehensive manner.The state women and child welfare department informed this to the Telangana high court on Friday.

She filed the affidavit in response to a direction given by the high court which sought the government’s response to a letter written by B Mahalatha and 10 others who brought to the notice of the court the miserable conditions of girls locked in such marriages.Though the high court had earlier directed the state to consider providing 5% reservation to such girls in educational institutions, the director of child welfare, in her affidavit, said a policy decision will be taken by the state.“As far as we are concerned, we can get them admitted to state-run residential schools and Durga Bai Deshmukh Polytechnic College in Hyderabad,” she said. “Except for providing the reservations, we have taken several steps in tune with HC directions to help the girls cope with the crisis,” state’s special counsel A Sanjeev Kumar said. The suggestion to provide 3% reservation in jobs cannot be given as that would amount to incentivising child marriages, the director said in her affidavit. The letter by Mahalatha and others narrated the woes of the child brides who were forced into marriages and were dying during pregnancies and deliveries. Even if they survive, they suffer from several health complications and give birth to children afflicted with various ailments. As there were no protection homes run by the state to take care of such girls, they are forced to stay put with their families and facing abuse and ill-treatment. The Supreme Court had also directed the states and the high courts to accord priority to welfare of such victims. The bench asked the state government to consider providing some quantum of reservations for such girls and closed the PIL.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/separate-homefor-child-bridessoon-t-to-hc/articleshow/89190227.cms||---

During the first wave of the pandemic, the LMA shut the main entrance which leads to Faizain High School at Pension Lane, in new Bowenpally, army residential quarters and a 240-year-old place of worship, where nearly 150 Muslims used to attend daily prayers, citing sharpe surge in Covid cases. Residents of Bowenpally are upset as local military authorities (LMA) turned a blind eye on its promise to facelift a passage for hundreds of school-going children and locals in Bowenpally. It had allowed a passage adjacent to the main entrance. At that time, the LMA had a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with representatives of the Muslim Board. According to the MoU, LMA must build a proper road for free ingress and egress to the place of worship starting from ZPP Girls High School and ending at the entrance of Faizain High School.“Earlier, children used to reach their school in no time. But now tit takes them more than 10 to 15 minutes via the road which LMA opened as an alternate route. This road lies in poor condition,” Syed Siraj, a resident of Pension Lane told TOI. Fed up with LMA’s inordinate delay, they approached Malkajgiri Lok Sabha member, A Revanth Reddy. The MP assured to allot funds from MPLADS to build the road.  Muslim Board also urged union tourism minister, G Kishan Reddy to direct LMA to take up the formation of road. A series of inspections were undertaken by the president of cantonment board, Brigadier Abhjit Chandra, SCB chief executive officer, B Ajith Reddy and the SCB engineering wing. “Because of LMA’s decision, the school strength dipped. It has now dropped over 50 per cent,” Siraj said. Former SCB vice president, J Pratap urged the LMA to resolve the issue for the benefit of nearly 500 locals.  TOI contacted defence PRO wing on LMA’s stand on this issue, but in vain. Even the SCB officials refused to comment on the issue.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/lma-fails-to-reopen-road-inbowenpally-residents-irked/articleshow/89190230.cms||Sunil Mungara

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Property registration market values to go up by 15 to 60% from February 1||HYDERABAD: In just six months, the government has increased market values for registration of all types of properties in the state. With the government giving the go-ahead, the registration and stamps (R&S) department enhanced the market values between 15% and 60% on all types of properties such as agriculture, non-agriculture and commercial. The new rates will come into effect from February 1. The R&S department is expected to get Rs 12,000 crore revenue in the current financial year 2021-2022 and another Rs 3,000 crore to Rs 4,000 crore after the enhancement of market values. Official sources said the land values for registration will be enhanced to 50% for agriculture properties and to 60% on the existing rates in some villages. The R&S department collects both 7.5% stamp duty and registration charges based on the minimum land rates fixed by the government. In August last year, the government had enhanced the property values. “The maximum jump we have proposed on agriculture land is in areas where present market rates are 15 times more than the government rates. While it will be 50% in about 10,000 villages and gram panchayats, in about 400 to 500 villages, the hike will be 60% on the present rates,” a senior official of the R&S department told TOI. This means the present minimum rate for agriculture properties (Rs 75,000 per acre) for registrations would be increased to Rs 1.50 lakh per acre. Based on these values, the R&S department collects 7.5% for registering a property. When it comes to open plots, the proposal is to hike the rates by 35% on the existing values and 15% to 25% on flats. A senior official of CMO said even if the values were increased it will be less than the prevailing market rates. Buyers will also benefit as they get home loans on the government rates, officials said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/property-registration-mkt-values-to-go-up-by-15-to-60-from-feb-1/articleshow/89190235.cms||Koride Mahesh

Students rue that they are unable to spare any time for their studies which may affect their chances at the national exam.

I am working 24x7, even on holidays, for Covid vaccination, fever surveys (which is going only in Telangana). I have administered almost 1 lakh Covid vaccination doses under my supervision. My life is at stake if I don’t clear NEET PG this time,” tweeted Inzamam Ali, an aspirant urging the union health ministry to postpone the exam. Many others are worried that they’d not be able to complete their one year of internship on time, making them ineligible for the exam. Sizeable number of students also want the exam to be postponed as it clashes with the counselling for PG admissions for 2021-22. “The NEET-PG 2022 has been announced even before the counselling of NEET-PG 2021 concludes. The first round results aren’t out yet and there are lot of candidates who are just hopeful to get their dream branches and would want to wait. Holding the exam on the result day is so insensible,” said a NEET aspirant from Osmania Medical College.

Several of them said they do not want their academic careers rocked by the war-like situation as they get ready for their next semester. Sohail Mohammed from Motinagar, who is in his third year of study in Ukraine, said: “We do not know what is in store but we do not want our studies to be disturbed. We have been intimated that our next semester will start on February 1,” Sohail told TOI. There are nearly 200 students from Telangana and AP pursuing their studies in Ukraine. The students have registered themselves with Indian embassy in Kyiv. Dheeraj from Rajendranagar, who is pursuing his medicine in Ukraine, said if the situation gets worse, they would be flown out of the country by the embassy. Embassy officials had asked the students to provide details like name, age, gender, passport number, location in Ukraine and the state they hail from in India. Their contact numbers in Ukraine and in India have been taken. Students were asked to mention the university they are studying in. According to the embassy website, there are approximately 18,000 Indian students studying medicine and engineering in various Ukrainian universities. “When I called up my brother, he told me that the atmosphere is peaceful in Dnipro city where he resides and studies. But since I have been watching the news and following the developments in the last fortnight, I explained to him what was going on and that he should be alert. He has registered himself with the Indian embassy,” Haseeb Mohammed, brother of Sohail, said. Jyoti, who resides in Iviv region, said the situation is normal but they have been asked to fill up the forms. “There are several students from India in Ukraine and if there is an emergency situation for evacuation, we are not sure how it will unfold for us,” Jyoti said. “I am disheartened. I do not want to go back. I want to stay here and study in the university,” Jyoti said, hinting that several of them want to pursue their academic careers having spent huge amounts to travel down to Ukraine.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/students-from-t-andhra-caught-in-crossfire-of-ukraine-russia-conflict/articleshow/89190264.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

Rachakonda police said that auto drivers Katravath Raju, K Santosh, D Srinivasulu; the five students, E Ganesh, M Venkatesh, K Harilal, K Ganesh, M Ganesh; and farmer K Raju were arrested from Dhanbad. Police said that Katravath began recruiting people from Telangana for the racket after coming in touch with Vikram Thakur of Jharkhand. The two had become friends as Thakur always used Katravath to travel whenever he came to Hyderabad. “Vikram told Katravath that he and his associates in Jharkhand were finding it difficult to execute cyber frauds in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh due to language barrier. To overcome this drawback, Vikram used Katravath to get Telugu speakers to work in his call centres from Jharkhand,” a Rachakonda police officer said. Vikram offered 30 per cent commission to Katravath for helping him recruit Telugu-speaking persons who could call up people in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh as part of his online fraud of offering loans and other banking services. Police said that Katravath in turn contacted his brother-in-law Santosh to arrange people from their native place Peddamandad in Wanaparthy district. In January 2021, the now arrested accused went to Dhanbad where Vikram arranged accommodation, police said. These nine accused were given training on how to execute online frauds such as phishing. Police said that Vikram Thakur procured different SIM cards and also had bank accounts on fictitious names.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/cyber-crooks-take-telugus-to-jkhand-to-run-t-ap-con/articleshow/89190265.cms||---

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: ‘Ill’ Trinamool Congress' Anubrata Mandal skips CBI call in BJP worker murder case||KOLKATA: Trinamool Congress Birbhum district president Anubrata Mandal was on Friday summoned by the CBI in connection with the alleged murder of Gaurav Sarkar, a BJP supporter, at Gopalnagar village in Birbhum. Sources close to Mandal indicated he has cited illness as the reason for not appearing before the central investigating agency. Mandal was asked to appear before the agency’s unit office at Ilambazar. Mandal reportedly said that he was unwell. He had earlier skipped CBI summons in the illegal coal mining case, citing illness. Sarkar was allegedly attacked by a group of Trinamool Congress workers on May 2, the day the election results were announced. It was alleged that some people present in a victory rally on that day suddenly attacked him. He was beaten up severely and collapsed there. Later, Sarkar succumbed to his injuries. On September 13 last year, the CBI arrested an FIR-named person, Dilip Midya from Hooghly, in connection to the incident after conducting several searches in the area. The next day, the agency reached the Ilambazar office of Trinamool Congress to question some party workers. They also questioned Ram Murmu, former president of Ilambazar panchayat samiti, at CBI’s Durgapur camp office. Two more accused persons, Rabi Baske and Lagai Hansda, were arrested by the agency later. “The CBI is following the list provided to them from the BJP headquarters. This is yet another example of how they are trying to silence opposing voices by using central investigating agencies. Moreover, how can they classify violence as pre-poll and post-poll? Won’t they investigate the violence before the polls?” said TMC MP Sukhendu Sekhar Roy.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/ill-anubrata-skips-cbi-call-in-bjp-worker-murder-case/articleshow/89190267.cms||Rohit Khanna

According to the complaint by his mother, “seven-eight persons, including three-four women” reached their house on May 2 . “I lodged another complaint with Narkeldanga PS with specific names of the accused.

---||Kolkata||Now, TMC mulls resolution against guv in state assembly||Kolkata: Trinamool Congress on Friday indicated it was exploring moving a resolution in the Bengal assembly condemning the role of governor Jagdeep Dhankhar. This coincided with Dhankhar issuing a two-page statement criticising speaker Biman Banerjee.TMC is also likely to move a motion in the Rajya Sabha against Dhankhar in the budget session.Chief whip in the Bengal assembly Tapas Ray said, “Never since Independence, Bengal has seen a governor working like a party leader. From the day he stepped into Bengal, he has been singularly targeting CM Mamata Banerjee and the Trinamool Congress government. Is this his constitutional role? Is this what Raj Bhavan is for? We will do whatever needs to be done.” Ray, however, said that the mode of protest in the assembly will be decided by the party.Leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari immediately dubbed such resolutions illegal. “If they resort to such illegal act, BJP legislators will oppose it firmly,” he said.Speaker Banerjee said: “When the Bengal assembly budget session starts, you can see the proceedings for yourself. I cannot say what may or may not happen in anticipation.”Banerjee’s statements came after Dhankhar issued a strongly-worded statement against the speaker. The immediate trigger appeared to be Banerjee’s statement that Dhankhar would have to henceforth show reason if he wanted to visit the assembly voluntarily.In an official release, the Raj Bhavan said that the governor “has expressed concern regarding the widely reported unfortunate and unconstitutional stance of Hon’ble Speaker West Bengal Assembly”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/now-tmc-mulls-resolution-against-guv-in-state-assembly/articleshow/89190269.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Covid-19: 'West Bengal govt wants 85% vaccination cover for teens before school reopening decision’||KOLKATA: Calcutta High Court directed the state government to clarify its stand on reopening of schools to the court by the next hearing on February 14. But advocate general S N Mookherjee contended the state wanted to vaccinate at least 85% school students below 18 years before taking a decision. When the division bench of Justice Prakash Shrivastava and Justice Rajarshi Bharadwaj sought the state’s opinion as it took up the four petitions on reopening of schools on Friday, Mookherjee said the state would submit its position after consultation with the West Bengal Disaster Management Authority and health, education and home departments in a week. Mookherjee submitted a school vaccination status report, which showed 74.8% inoculation coverage by the state school education department till January 25. Vaccination in most south Bengal districts, including Kolkata and Howrah, were below the 85% target, while that for Darjeeling, Kalimpong, Cooch Behar, Alipurduar, Murshidabad and Purulia is above 85%. The senior state counsel said the government was monitoring the situation daily. “Students below 18 years couldn’t take the vaccine till January 3. There are 45 lakh students in the 15-18 year age group who need vaccination. Of them 33 lakh have been given the first dose. There has to be a gap of two to three weeks between the first and the second doses. We want to cover at least 85% students,” Mookherjee said. Senior counsel for petitioners Bikash Bhattacharya pointed out schools in many other states had resumed on-campus classes. He said that the prolonged shutdown of schools was taking a psychological effect on school students and also leading to a spike in dropout rates. “Let schools reopen with proper distancing norms. Why are schools being kept closed when all other activities are on with Covid restrictions?” he said. The advocate general conceded there was a “hell and heaven difference” between online teaching and holding in-person classes, particularly when there were connectivity problems in rural areas. “We are all eager to open schools. We have initiated open-air classes in neighbourhoods (paara shikshayatan). But we have to tread with caution. The responsibility of reopening schools lies with the state government. We had reopened schools ahead of the Pujas but were forced to go in for a shutdown,” said Mookherjee, pointing to the alert from the Institute of Child Health about Omicron and Delta variants affecting child health. The advocate general also expressed concern over Omicron spreading fast. “We have to take a policy decision. We invite proposals from stakeholders. The state is in a dialogue with all concerned. We invite suggestions from all concerned on how to go about it,” he said. Contesting petitioners’ argument that classes had resumed in Europe, Mookherjee said, “We also have statistics from several schools in Europe that didn’t start classes despite having an improved health infrastructure.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/govt-wants-85-vax-cover-for-teens-before-school-reopening-decision/articleshow/89190270.cms||Subrata Chattoraj
---||Kolkata||Covid-19: Cases on the ground confirm Delta fears in West Bengal||KOLKATA: Despite a sharp drop in positive cases and in the positivity rate, Covid death count has refused to drop in Bengal, staying above 30 a day for about two weeks now. Doctors believe that a significant percentage of these severe cases could have been triggered by the Delta variant. Even as genome sequencing data has shown that 80% of current cases in Bengal are Omicron, Delta continues to be a concern. The Union health ministry has said that Delta is still a concern in few states including Bengal, Maharashtra and Odisha. Ministry officials said since Delta remains in circulation, a section of patients especially those with comorbidities have the risk of getting severe disease. “The number of Covid cases has dropped sharply but we continue to get very sick positive patients in our ICU. From the severity and features of the disease, it appears that many of them might have been caused by Delta,” said director of pulmonology wing at CMRI Raja Dhar. TIMES VIEWThis is yet another sign of the virus’s unpredictable behaviour. It also underscores the fact that our struggle is not yet over. Getting the vaccine and responsible, Covid-safe behaviour remain our best shots against the disease.Some hospitals are now sending a few select swab samples of critical patients for genome sequencing to detect the variant. CMRI so far has got the result of five such samples — three were detected with Delta while two samples was Omicron. “Second wave came riding on Delta and it displaced other variants completely. Now even as Omicron is the dominant variant it has not taken over Delta completely. Patients with drop in oxygen saturation and symptoms like anosmia (loss of smell) continue to get hospitalised. These cases are probable infection by Delta,” said Peerless Hospital microbiologist Bhaskar Narayan Chaudhuri. The hospital too has sent 10 samples from admitted patients with severe diseases for genome sequencing. The results, however, are awaited. Take the example of a senior paediatrician who had tested positive two weeks ago. Even as he was at home isolation for a few days he developed respiratory distress for which he had to be admitted to Apollo Multispecialty Hospital Kolkata. “This doctor particularly thought the infection was mild due to Omicron. But he developed lung issues later on and he has all classical, clinical and radiological features of the infection caused by Delta that we saw during the second wave. In fact we have about three-four patients on mechanical ventilation with similar infection features which are likely to be caused by Delta or could be late manifestation of Omicron,” said Debraj Jash, consultant pulmonologist at Apollo Kolkata had seen about four deaths on a daily average till first week of January. Subsequently, the average daily death has remained eight. “The fact that a section of people continues to get severe disease leading to death is a concern. In all probability, these could be due to Delta which is still much in circulation,” said Medica Hospital microbiologist Soumen Saha.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/cases-on-the-ground-confirm-delta-fears/articleshow/89190271.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kolkata||Bengal touches 12-crore vaccination mark in a year, last 1 crore inoculated in 16 days||KOLKATA: Bengal, which has the third highest population eligible for inoculation after UP and Maharashtra, crossed the 12 crore vaccination-mark on Friday. After launching its vaccination drive on January 16, 2021, Bengal took 105 days or three and a half months to reach the first 1-crore mark. The state had to wait till April 30, 2021 to vaccinate the first one crore people, but took only 12 days to move from 7 crore to 8 crore on November 3, 2021 and 16 days from 11 crore to 12 crore on January 27, 2022. According to the Cowin data, reaching the first 1-crore mark for double vaccination, the drive for which started on February 13, 2021, was a big hurdle. It took 192 days to reach the first 1-crore mark, the state took merely 27 days for its journey from four crore to five crore. “The initial difficulty was the non-availability of vaccines. But the moment vaccine production and its distribution improved, we went on an overdrive to inoculate as many people as possible ahead of the third wave,” said a senior health department officer. On Friday, nearly 6,000 camps were held and more than 7 lakh people were inoculated. Till Friday evening, Bengal clocked 12,07,71,117 jabs, with the first dose alone set to cross 7-crore mark and second dose, 5 crore. Eight lakh people have also been administered their precautionary doses. Kolkata has completed 92 lakh jabs so far with KMC running a large number of vaccination sites and government-run hospitals and health centres holding drives. Among the districts, North 24 Parganas is leading the drive, with its figures crossing 1-crore mark. Across the district, 6 lakh to 7 lakh doses were administered daily on almost all days of the week for the past few weeks. Health officials said the door-to-door campaign also pushed the drive ahead. The initiative not only helped trace those who had missed the second dose, it also covered many who were yet to take their first doses. The drive also gained momentum owing to sustained campaigning that could allay some vaccine hesitancy.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/bengal-touches-12-crore-vaccination-mark-in-a-year-last-1-crore-inoculated-in-16-days/articleshow/89190272.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

Police, who suspect Rohit Halder had died by suicide, have sent his body for post-mortem. Residents of the area claimed Halder was forced to end his life after he was accused of theft by the authorities after one of the officials lost Rs 5,000 on January 23. Cops even found a suicide note from the room. Police had a tough time managing the irate crowd as they confronted hostel officials and tried to drag some of them out of the premises. The hostel — Ramakrishna Seva Mission — that housed around two dozen students was not related to Ramakrishna Math and Mission, police clarified.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/hostel-officials-attacked-after-cook-found-dead/articleshow/89190274.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Wedding season push to footfall revival at parlours||KOLKATA: The wedding season has given a lease of life to the city’s beauty parlours that have been witness to a steady increase in footfall since they reopened on January 8. While wedding dates are keeping parlours busy, what has also increased the footfall is the rush for pre-wedding treatments. Hair cuts have gone up. Many, who didn’t visit parlours in months, are now willing to take a chance. A wedding in the family is a good enough reason for them to go scissor-happy. Since re-opening on January 8, hair stylist Jolly Chanda has had at least 30 women at the two branches of her Satin Rose Salon and Spa for haircuts because of wedding invitations. “We have had a 20% increase in the number of footfalls for weddings. Many who have cancelled their weddings due to Covid are now organizing small-ring ceremonies. The marriage registry is done at such events which are attended by immediate family members and friends only. Brides are flocking to the parlours to get groomed for such ceremonies now,” she said. A Covid survivor, who was suffering from a tremendous hair fall, rushed to her parlour recently to get a haircut for a family wedding. It was the first time this new mother had gone out of her house, leaving behind her infant at home. “First they go for haircuts and also come for styling on the day of the event,” she added. Some are taking bookings well in advance to get smoothening, touch-ups and fresh highlights done. After Sharmila Singh Flora opened her parlour on January 10, she has seen a regular surge of clients keen on doing keratin treatment for frizzy hair, body polishing and facials. “Many have a wedding in the family and those with dry, dull and frizzy hair during these months of no parlour visits are approaching us for keratin treatment that will at least ensure smooth, frizz-free and manageable hair for six months,” she said. Since reopening, she had three bridal bookings each for the two wedding dates. “In the pre-pandemic days, we would get at least six to seven bridal bookings on wedding dates. Things hit rock bottom in between. On January 18 and 24, we got three bookings each. Whoever comes with a bride also gets the hair and makeup done. On January 29, we again have three bookings,” she said. Abhirup Nandy, founder and creative director of Fuse Salon, has seen a surge in body polishing requests for grooms. “Apart from hair styling, there are a number of appointments for beard trimming of grooms. Majority of clients who earlier asked for other services now are primarily focusing on hair colour keeping the wedding season in mind. In the digital age of Instagram and Facebook, the sudden change in hair colour will register when they get photographed at events.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/wedding-season-push-to-footfall-revival-at-parlours/articleshow/89190275.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Kolkata||Rly stns address key green issues||Kolkata: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) bench of Justice B Amit Sthalekar (judicial member) and Saibal Gupta (expert member) on Friday disposed of the long-drawn cases of environmental degradation by Howrah and Sealdah railway station complexes. Both these station complexes have already addressed the issues of environmental degradations by installing a number of effluent treatment plants (ETP), rooftop solar photovoltaic cells for generating green and clean energy and installing rain-water harvesting system. “I am personally very happy at the outcome of the series of orders passed by the NGT. Eastern Railway also responded to those orders in a proactive manner and brought in some qualitative changes,” said green crusader Subhas Datta, who had filed the case in 2017.The NGT bench directed the West Bengal Pollution Control Board to ensure time-to-time inspection of the ETP and to collect water samples for testing and also ensure maintenance of the standard norms. The NGT directed the station complexes to utilise rain water that they would harvest to use exclusively for recharging the ground water. Earlier, experts expressed concern that indiscriminate withdrawal of ground water may cause large scale subsidence.The court also directed railway authorities to install more such rain water harvesting facilities on both premises. It directed both the stations to produce manure from the huge amount of food wastes generated at eateries inside the complexes from the compost plant.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/rly-stns-address-key-green-issues/articleshow/89190276.cms||---

The government has already approached markets, retailers, stock brokers and other institutions with safety guidelines for cyber security in the wake of rising cases where fraudsters are coming up with newer methods to dupe people of their money. Colleges and universities store data of thousands of students and their own staff members — some of which is sensitive information and can be used for online frauds. Two weeks ago, several professors of an educational institution on College Street made a complaint that they had been duped by suspicious callers. “Every college or university has data of several thousand people, including bank account details, Aadhaar numbers and other sensitive information. It is important that everybody working here should be aware of the cyber safety guidelines,” said an official of the education department. On Friday, all officials of educational institutes, including teachers, administrative staff and others, were provided with a link where they were required to log in with their details and take a short course. “The guidelines included dos and don’ts as far as sharing sensitive information is concerned. A small slip up can lead to harm,” said a professor of a north Kolkata college who took the pledge.According to the guidelines, nobody should share important information on social media platforms, nor share one-time passwords with anybody. They should also avoid filling up survey forms on suspicious sites and protect netbanking PINs. Two weeks ago, cops held a meeting with market committees and asked them to be cautious with transactions in the digital mode. The education department is planning to conduct a workshop for students once offline classes resume.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/state-organises-cyber-security-workshop-for-college-univ-staff/articleshow/89190277.cms||Zeeshan Javed

KMDA has been working on plans to develop the 192-acre Rabindra Sarobar as an eco-tourism destination. Apart from new green zones with different species of plants, there are plans to have medicinal garden, a nature observatory zone, a fungus garden and other such areas. At present, there are around 7,000 trees of 70-75 species at Rabindra Sarobar.“The MoU will be signed for better management, supervision and nurturing of plants and trees at both the sarobars,” said a KMDA official. “Till now, gardeners planted saplings at any space available. The MoU will ensure that saplings and trees are planted in a systematic way, and their scientific names will be put up to attract the youth, students and nature lovers,” said a KMDA official.  The authorities, with help from an agency, will survey the Rabindra Sarobar water body to assess the condition of the waterbed. A workshop with stakeholders has been planned in the first week of March to discuss ways to improve the water body’s quality and maintain the dissolved oxygen level.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/kmda-push-to-turn-city-lakes-greener/articleshow/89190278.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Mercury touches 13.7°C||Kolkata: The city remained chilly on Friday with the minimum temperature plunging to 13.7°C — from Thursday’s 17.6°C — even as a cool breeze enhanced the chill factor. The mercury may drop further to 12°C on Saturday, said the Met office. This, however, could be the final chilly spell this winter even as a western disturbance is set to pull the temperature up by the middle of next week. “It will remain cool and breezy till Monday. The mercury will start climbing on Tuesday. It could touch 15°C-16°C subsequently,” said RMC director GK Das. A western disturbance is set to strike next week, leading to rain in Kolkata and south Bengal on February 4. “It will again pull the temperature up, though the rain could be light. Once the western disturbance recedes, the mercury may not fall since we are approaching the end of winter,” said Das.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/mercury-touches-13-7c/articleshow/89190279.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Blame game after suicide bid in Salt Lake guest house||KOLKATA: Mushrooming of guest houses in the neighbourhood has been keeping Salt Lake residents worried in the wake of multiple instances of crime and accidents. On Thursday, a BA Block neighbourhood was rocked by the sound of a blast as they traced it from a guest house in a residential building. It turned out a 26-year-old woman who had checked in on Thursday had attempted suicide by setting herself on fire inside the guest house. Cops and locals had to break open the door to rescue her. She is admitted at NRS Hospital with 35% burn injuries. “We were lucky the fire was put out early on Thursday. Or else our home could also have caught fire because of no fault of ours,” said Raju Giri, who lived on the floor below the room at the guest house where the woman had attempted suicide. Other residents claimed living near a guest house at times become a menace as outsiders often play loud music and throw empty liquor bottles from the windows on to their compounds. “Many guest houses have come up in the township and it is to be seen whether they at all have permission to operate. We are planning to place a memorandum to the civic authorities on this guest house issue once the polls are over,” said Bidhannagar welfare association secretary Sarat Mullick. Officials of Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC) admitted many guest houses have come up without informing the civic authorities and that there was no figure available as to how many of them were operating illegally. “As per rule, the urban development department allots permission for guest houses following conversion of the lease deed for using a plot or a building for commercial purpose. Once they give permission, those who would be running the guest houses register with the civic body and deposit the fees. We can only check for anomalies only when there is any complaint,” said a civic official. An officer of Bidhannagar City Police said they maintained a record of guest houses operating under a particular police station jurisdiction and also held timely meetings with the operators. “Before operating a guest house, an owner has to submit all relevant documents and also keep a data base of the guests and secure the premises with CCTVs and share the data with us,” he said. Multiple guest house owners claimed they follow all guidelines. “We update the IDs of guests in a website maintained by the cops. We also try to profile our guests before allotting a room but what has happened in Salt Lake with the woman is a one-off case,” said Satrajit Roy, who runs a guest house at BD Block.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Errant motorists cough up hefty traffic fines||KOLKATA: Police have started slapping enhanced fines on all traffic offences from Friday. Conservative estimates show the city police will be collecting Rs 14.6 lakh on a single day through fines if the current rate of prosecutions continue. Provided there are compounding cases (where the offender has/had previous cases against him for such offences), the fines collected per day is set to go even higher. A look at Thursday figures is an indicator. Under section 122 of MV Act (illegal stops and parking), where there were 1,335 prosecutions, the fines ranged between Rs 500-Rs 1,500. Under sections 128 (triple riding) and 129 (no helmets) where minimum fine is Rs 1,000, there were 95 and 163 prosecutions, respectively. Under MV Act 183 (overspeeding), where enhanced fines range between Rs 1,000 and Rs 2,000, another 91 prosecutions took place. Under MV 184 (dangerous driving), where the fines are steepest ranging between Rs 5,000 and Rs 10,000, 60 cases were slapped. With Lalbazar asking all sergeants to concentrate more on offences that lead to accidents — like drink-driving, not wearing helmets, signal violations and talking over phone — cops said the daily fine collection could go even higher. “On an average day, Kolkata records over 3,000 violations,” said a sergeant. Lalbazar reiterated that it was not trying to jack up traffic violation numbers. “We are trying to ensure that these prosecutions get reflected on the road. Otherwise, there is no point in collecting fines,” said a senior cop. Sources said a sharp eye will be kept to ensure that no cop prosecutes “without proper documentary evidence” . Cops are also worried that commercial vehicles might not be paying up fines. “We are in talks with the transport department in this regard,” said an officer. This became all the more true after several motorists on the road were found trying to convince sergeants not to prosecute them. “I was on the Dhalai bridge and riding at 64km/hr, a speed that the sergeant says amounts to overspeeding since the maximum speed allowed here for two-wheelers is 60km/hr. Is it fair for cops to prosecute me for Rs 1,000 for this marginal error?” Mainak Bose, a resident of Kamalgazi kept asking. Bus owners said multiple buses on different routes have already been fined over Rs 3000 in a single trip.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/errant-motorists-cough-up-hefty-traffic-fines/articleshow/89190281.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Today, Air India officially becomes a part of the Tata Group again, after seven decades.That was the message that welcomed Somdutta Lahiri, Koustav Sengupta, Jatin Tehri and hundreds of others who boarded Air India flights into or out of Kolkata on Friday.Nothing much had changed overnight when the airline's ownership changed hands, moving back into the Tata group fold after it was nationalised nearly 70 years ago. The aircraft were same as were the employees. Yet, the very fact that the Tatas, who had originally nurtured Air India into a world-class carrier, was again in charge and offered passengers a 'feel good' factor. Some even noticed a subtle change in the attitude of cabin crew as they were treated as guests and not mere passengers. Passengers who boarded or alighted from Air India flights admitted they felt excited being a part of history and hoped the change of ownership would also translate into a change in travel experience and ultimately reflect in the airline's fortunes. “My past past experience of flying with AI, especially during my journeys abroad, hasn't been pleasant. Their food was good but staff behaviour and cleanliness during long journeys left a lot to be desired. I had started avoiding Air India. On Friday though, it was a very good experience. The entire journey was seamless. The food was good, the hospitality of the cabin crew was top-notch. I am looking forward to more journeys with the revamped airline,” said Lahiri, a frequent flyer who reached Kolkata from Delhi on Friday.Sengupta, who lives in Salt Lake and returned from the US earlier this month, was taking his first domestic flight after spending mandatory days in quarantine. He, too, was pleasantly surprised by the AI experience. “Originally, a different aircraft was to operate on the route. When the aircraft changed, so did seat allotment. Going by my previous experience of Air India, I was wary of problems on board. But I was surprised that the cabin crew and ground staff handled it very professionally and then came the announcement informing us that the Tata group had officially taken over the airline. I believe that led to the change in attitude,” said Sengupta.Tehri, a CA with a private firm in Delhi, said the journey was perfect and very unlike AI. "I believe the attitude of cabin crew and ground staff has changed for the better. I have been a frequent flyer between Delhi and Kolkata. But I had stopped taking AI for various reasons. On Friday, I flew AI and am glad I did. Henceforth, this will be my choice of airline,” he said.Twitter was also abuzz with passenger reactions. One flyer, Rohit, wrote: “Guests replacing passengers speaks volumes of Tata’s values and commitment. Not saying tataaaa to Tata.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/on-board-services-of-tatas-air-india-get-a-thumbs-up/articleshow/89190283.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

Mayor Firhad Hakim, replying to a query from Ellora Saha, a councillor representing Burrabazar, on acquisition of extremely vulnerable buildings on Friday, said efforts were on to save the lives of residents of the city’s rickety buildings by vacating them and demolishing the dangerous portions.Hakim said when the state gives its nod for an amendment, the KMC would be in a position to pave the way for reconstruction of the unsafe buildings keeping the interests of the tenants intact. “We need stricter rules. We won’t harm the interests of the tenants as they will be given space when a condemned building is demolished for reconstruction,” Hakim said.“Lucrative businesses are being run in the residential units which are not structurally sound. They don’t bother to take trade licences from the KMC for running businesses and the electrical wires hang dangerously. They may cause a major fire incident,” Saha said. The mayor conceded it was a problem and he will look into it.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/kmc-seeks-stricter-rules-for-unsafe-bldgs/articleshow/89190284.cms||Saikat Ray

Replying to queries from a section of the media, Hakim said they were never in favour of suspension of pension despite a funds crunch. “Yes, we are going through a financial crisis. We need Rs 1,000 crore to repay our debt. But that does not mean we will suspend the pension of our employees. We don’t have any plans to either suspend pension or delay salary disbursement,” said Hakim. However, Hakim made it clear the civic body would drastically cut down on unnecessary expenditure and take steps to augment revenue to cope with the financial loss. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/civic-body-will-not-suspend-pension-hakim/articleshow/89190285.cms||---

The finance department has realised that several bank accounts enrolled for direct benefit transfer under Lakshmir Bhandar are, in fact, jointly held.According to All India Bank Officers’ Confederation’s state general secretary Sanjoy Das, around 40% beneficiaries of the scheme get their monthly incentive in joint accounts. He indicated that many were reluctant to open single accounts. “Also, there was no categorical bar on enrolling joint accounts. We did not want to harass anybody,” Das added.Amitava Makhal, a retired bank official, said he had insisted that beneficiaries open single savings accounts at his branch to ensure greater economic independence. An official of a nationalised bank in Diamond Harbour said women associated with self-help groups had single accounts, but most others had preferred to use existing joint accounts with their respective spouse.Sociologist Ruby Sain pointed out that if the money was being sent to a joint account, the wife was by default dependent on her husband to withdraw it and that sort of defeated the purpose of the Lakshmir Bhandar scheme.Psychologist Amit Chakraborty said it was difficult to change the mindset overnight in a patriarchal society. “Even teachers of government colleges often prefer their husbands to withdraw cash from their joint accounts. It is given that the husband has or should have more control.”Lakshmir Bhandar, which offers Rs 500 a month to general category beneficiaries and Rs 1,000 to women from SC/ST communities, was launched after Trinamool Congress formed the government in Bengal for the third consecutive time. “The scheme was launched keeping in mind the state’s monthly average consumption expenditure of a household, which is Rs 5,249. Under the scheme, 10-20% of the monthly expenditure of a beneficiary can be covered,” an official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/40-of-lakshmir-bhandar-beneficiaries-have-joint-a/cs/articleshow/89190291.cms||---

Cops from Lake police station started the rescue operation while firefighters joined them later. The blaze was finally brought under control around 3.45am with a single fire tender,” said an officer. The deceased, a divorcee, who did not have any significant job, lived in the house along with his mother. They let out a portion of the house for income. Apart from being an alcoholic, he used to smoke a lot. “A short circuit might have triggered the fire.

---||Kolkata||Birla Tyres to demerge its passenger car radial biz||Kolkata: Manjushree Khaitan-led BK Birla group firm Birla Tyres (BTL) will demerge its passenger car radial business into a separate company — Birla Tyre Radials. Birla Tyres was demerged from group flagship Kesoram Industries in 2018 as part of debt restructuring process. Kesoram CEO and director P Radhakrishnan told TOI that this is also aimed at debt restructuring and giving optimum solutions to creditors. The radial firm would inherit a major portion of the debt of BTL. As per the scheme, the radial outfit would be a wholly owned subsidiary of BTL, where promoters have 50.9% stake. Radhakrishnan said that both secured and unsecured creditors will be offered equity shares of the resultant company in the second step. It is also learnt that post restructuring, the promoters’ group will be left with minority shareholding with creditors having majority. “There is a possibility of a financial investor coming in with some stake,” added a source. However, the Kesoram CEO did not offer a comment on this. BTL now has two segments: tyres for the commercial vehicles and passenger car radial business, which is not operational yet. The firm has informed stock exchanges that BTL has been engaged in the manufacturing of tyres at its facility in Balasore, Odisha, catering to commercial vehicles under the brand name of Birla Tyres.BTL has also been in the process for setting up a new plant for passenger car radial (PCR) tyres adjacent to its existing facility in Balasore. The accumulated losses of BTL as on March 31, 2021 was Rs 709.4 crore and Rs 847.7 crore as on November 30, 2021 and the share capital of BTL stands fully eroded. The outstanding fund-based debt of BTL as on November 2021 is Rs 1,057.8 crore.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/birla-tyres-to-demerge-its-passenger-car-radial-biz/articleshow/89190293.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Two fraudsters from Jamtara arrested for duping Rabindra Bharati University professors||KOLKATA: The bank fraud section of the detective department nabbed two members of a Jamtara gang in Jharkhand two weeks after a couple of Rabindra Bharati University professors had been duped of Rs 8.5 lakh. Cops have recovered Rs 2.4 lakh so far and returned to one of the professors who had lost around Rs 3.5 lakh to the fraud. The accused, Pradip Bauri (47) and Milan Dan (23), are being brought to Kolkata on transit remand from Jharkhand. “During investigation, it was revealed that the money had been transferred from a professor’s account with the help of a specific payment gateway. Subsequently, the money was transferred to different bank accounts via another specific payment app (that facilitates small merchants to accept payments via UPI for free),” said an officer. “Raids were conducted at Jamtara and its adjacent areas where the accused were arrested. Investigation revealed that a high amount of the defrauded money was transferred to the public sector bank account of Bauri who withdrew it and handed it over to Dan. It was Dan who had procured the bank details from the complainant over phone and transferred the money. Both the accused will be produced in a local court with a prayer for police custody,” said DC (cyber) Bidisha Kalita. The case was earlier recorded at the Shakespeare Sarani police station on January 13 by Paula Sengupta, a professor of Rabindra Bharati University. The Behala division cyber cell has also helped two other victims — one a private school teacher and the other a medical representative — get back the money, which had been siphoned through fraudulent transactions. The teacher, Anirban Ganguly, had lost Rs 94,210. “The victim had paid his credit card bill through CRED but the payment was unsuccessful. He lost the money when he tried to contact with the customer care. We recovered the full amount,” said DC (Behala) Swati Bhangalia. In another case, the medical representative, Sudip Halder of Haridevpur, had lost Rs 56,000 when he was asked to share OTPs with the caller for waiving yearly charges on credit card. “Behala police recovered the money,” said Bhangalia.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/two-fraudsters-from-jamtara-arrested-for-duping-rbu-profs/articleshow/89190294.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Among the injured were two civic volunteers, Amit Sardar (33) and Arsadul Sk (36) who went out in the car with three others, Sirajul Sardar (40), Saidul Sk (38) and Bhaskar Purkait (36), for revelry on Thursday night. Amit, who works as a driver of Mograhat police station, was behind the wheels of the car that was badly damaged under the impact of the accident. The five were rushed to Baghajatin State General Hospital where Sirajul was declared dead. Three others were shifted to Chittaranjan Hospital while the other was released after treatment. “All of them were drunk,” said Awadhesh Pathak, DC (Jadavpur). This was the third fatal accident due to drink-driving in the city in a span of 10 days. Cops said those travelling in the car had stayed the night in north Kolkata and visited a couple of sex workers. Since all of them were heavily drunk, they set out for home around 6am to evade the naka checks that are wrapped up by 5am. TIMES VIEWThere needs to be a crackdown on this menace. Back-to-back incidents should be a cause of concern for cops as well as law-abiding motorists and pedestrians.“The bus was parked illegally on the road as the driver had gone to have some tea in the morning. The car hit it from behind,” said an officer of Garia guard. He added, “We found Sirajul unconscious on the rear seat. He had no external major injury. He was sitting beside the driver and he succumbed to internal injuries.” Abhijit Manna, a pedestrian, who helped cops rescue the victims from the mangled remains of the car, said, “All of them were reeking of alcohol. They had sustained multiple injuries.” According to the police, Amit confessed to having dozed off while driving the car. He was driving the car at a high speed as the road was empty in the morning. “The case is being probed by the cops of Patuli police station. The CCTV footage is being checked with regard to the investigation. We will also slap the bus driver with charges for parking his vehicle illegally,” said an officer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/drink-drive-claims-one-leaves-4-injured-near-patuli-on-bypass/articleshow/89190295.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||Bengal cancer hub starts OPD, surgeries ahead of schedule||KOLKATA: The Cancer Care Hub (CCH), a collaborative project by the Bengal government and the Tata Memorial Centre (TMC) Mumbai, has opened its doors at the Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education and Research (IPGMER) within seven months after the project was announced by chief minister Mamata Banerjee. The hub opened the outpatient department (OPD) for onco-surgery last Tuesday from its temporary location at the IPGMER. Two surgeries on cancer patients have already been conducted. The services will be expanded by next week when honorary consultants in different cancer disciplines start joining the hospital. The project has taken off even before the construction of the building for the facility is yet to start. In June last year, the CM had announced this joint venture with TMC for two such hubs — one at IPGMER and another at the North Bengal Medical College in Siliguri. For the Kolkata project, the land at 1, Harish Mukherjee Road opposite the SSKM Hospital campus was identified. “Construction the new G + 10 building will take at least two years. Therefore, the high power committee for the CCH felt that instead of waiting for the building to be ready, we should start the project from the existing hospital facility,” said Manimoy Banerjee director IPGMER. The onco-surgery OPD services took off last Tuesday from a designated space on the ground floor of SSKM’s new OPD building. Two young women, including the one, who had undergone treatment for ovarian cancer at two different hospitals, were operated upon. Both are recuperating well after the surgery. “Along with the OPD space, we have also started six beds for indoor admission in the chest and cancer blocks. The beds will be ramped up and services will be scaled up further,” said professor Jayesh Kumar Jha, surgical oncology head at IPGMER. Jha was roped in recently from another government hospital for the CCH. The committee decided to launch the services on a small scale at a meeting held in December . Currently, the OPD services are available twice a week. “We will slowly expand the services. From February 1, we are expecting a team of honorary consultants from different disciplines to come in. We are also aiming to start a leukaemia treatment facility from February 4,” said radiation oncology head Aloke Ghosh Dastidar, chairman of the committee. The honorary consultant panel will have on its board the alumni of Tata Memorial Hospital (TMH) who are now based in Kolkata, including Sourav Datta, Abhay Kumar, Kaushik Nandy, Sudip Das and Arindam Mondal.

There are some gaps as to where the incident took place, but it seems she was raped in the moving car. She was also told to hand over money to the accused.

A tiger was found dead in Dhamokhar buffer zone of Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve on Friday even as a leopard was found dead near Panpath core zone. This is the fourth tiger death in the state this month, and second in Bandhavgarh in nine days. What’s worse, forest officers fear the leopard may have fallen victim to poachers. Forest officers are using sniffer dogs and a forensics team to investigate the leopard death. The park management conducted raids in the vicinity and seized tools used in leopard poaching. Some suspects have been rounded up. Officers feel the spotted cat was caught in a snare laid by poachers for boar. The cause of the tiger’s death is yet to be ascertained, said officials. Two of the four tiger deaths this year have happened in Bandhavgarh. On January 7, a tiger cub was found killed and partially eaten in Bandhavgarh. The carcass was almost severed in two. On January 15, the famous ‘Collarwali’ tigress of Pench died of old age. It had brought up 29 cubs. And on January 19, an adult tigress was found dead in a well in Shahdol district. The carcass was found in Amjhor range at Kauwa Sarai village, said officials, adding that all its organs were found to be intact. Officers say it probably fell prey to an electrical wire trap. “Villagers must have tried to hide the carcass, fearing action. Some suspects have been rounded up and they are being interrogated,” said an officer. MP has lost around 51 tigers in the last 14 months.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/tiger-leopard-found-dead-in-bandhavgarh/articleshow/89190325.cms||---

---||Bhopal||Cong targets minister for calling Gandhi ‘fake’||Bhopal: The Madhya Pradesh Congress is demanding the resignation of higher education minister Mohan Yadav over a Facebook post where he purportedly calls Mahatma Gandhi a ‘fake father’ and Jawaharlal Nehru ‘fake chacha’ without naming them.On Thursday, Yadav’s FB message on the Republic Day Parade said: “Subhas Chandra Bose and Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel were seen in the Republic Day parade. Neither was the country’s fake father there, nor the fake ‘chacha’…. Neither was the iron lady there nor the inventor of the computer. The parade had a tableau of Kashi Vishwanath, another of Vaishno Devi. It was a scene of Sanatan culture. My country is truly changing, my country is coming out of the jaws of the servants of the British, my country is truly becoming independent. #Jai_Hind.”Congress protested, calling it “Godse mentality”. Congress media vice-president Bhupendra Gupta said, “Mohan Yadav does not know that Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, who BJP is now trying to claim as its own, was the first to call Mahatma Gandhi the Father of the Nation. Bose had said that without Gandhi, India’s struggle for Independence could not succeed.”Attacking BJP-RSS, Gupta said that those who “apologized to the British and took a pension of Rs 60 per month cannot understand the struggle of Gandhi or the sacrifice of Jawaharlal Nehru”. “Those who did not spend 50 paise on the country may not know what it means to give Rs 300 crore of property for the nation. The Mahatma Gandhi whose fee was 150 pounds per sitting as a lawyer left everything and came to the fight for freedom, wearing a ‘chaddar’,” Gupta said.“People of India should realise that these persons who criticize Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru do so for selfish reasons, only to make one organization happy,” he added.State Congress spokesman Narendra Saluja said, “The thinking of BJP is like Godse and it gets revealed every now and then.” He pointed out that being the higher education minister, it is Mohan Yadav’s responsibility to carry forward Gandhi’s views. “Instead, he is shamelessly calling the Father of the Nation a ‘fake father’ and insulting great leaders,” Saluja tweeted.“BJP should specify if it considers Mahatma to be the Father of the Nation or ‘fake father’. Is this the view of BJP about Nehruji, Indiraji and Rajivji?” Saluja asked on Twitter, adding: “Congress demands that BJP immediately remove Mohan Yadav as minister and apologise to the people of this country.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/cong-targets-minister-for-calling-gandhi-fake/articleshow/89190328.cms||Suchandana Gupta

Police resorted to lathi-charge to break up the fight.The skirmish was over the alleged demolition and ransacking of a selfie point built by Khurai municipal corporation. Congress claimed that the selfie-point was destroyed by unknown miscreants earlier this week. But BJP blamed local Congress leaders and registered an FIR.

He said, “A selfie-point constructed by the municipal corporation was totally destroyed and civic body complained to police. The accused were named but police didn’t arrest anyone. BJP workers were going to the SDM office on Thursday to submit a memorandum seeking arrest of the culprits when a large crowd of anti-socials attacked BJP workers and injured 100 of them. I was in Sagar and rushed to Khurai on getting information of the incident. We have informed CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan and he has promised an inquiry.”PCC chief Kamal Nath said Congress workers were falsely implicated. “BJP should not misuse power because time changes everything. Congress workers in that area are not alone, the entire party stands with them. We will protest this tactics of oppression. We demand an impartial inquiry in the incident. The culprits must be punished, if any innocent person is falsely implicated, we will not be quiet,” Nath said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/selfie-point-skirmish-in-khurai-sparks-a-political-tussle-in-mp/articleshow/89190332.cms||---

The move if approved by regulator could lead to a tariff hike of around 11%. Discoms have filed a true-up petition before MPERC. This hike, if approved, will be above the routine hike sought for the financial year 2022-23 earlier by the discoms. The tariff for financial year is decided before the start of the financial year by regulator based on estimated income and expenditures for the said financial year, through the annual revenue requirement submitted by discoms before the regulator. However, after the completion of the financial year, the audited details of discoms regarding actual income and expenditures is received, and based on this actual income and expenditure, discoms again file true-up petitions before regulator to allow them to adjust the actual losses or surpluses in the tariff for the next financial year. After filing the ARR for 2022-23 last month wherein discoms sought an overall hike of 8.7% against the estimated revenue gap— difference between income and expenditure— of Rs 3,915 crores. Now they have filed true-up petition for the actual revenue gap of Rs 4981 crores incurred in the year 2020-21. And of these Rs 4,981 crore, around Rs 973 crore is loss incurred due to depreciation as claimed by discoms. And around Rs 239 crore are bad debts, as per the petition filed by discoms. This means that in year 2020-21, discom assets depreciated by around Rs 2.66 crore daily. Accepting the petition, MPERC has sought suggestions, objections of the stakeholders over the issue till February 8, 2022. It is after considering all the facts, that MPERC will decide over the true-up petition, said sources.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/discoms-seek-hike-in-true-up-plea-power-to-cost-11-more-if-approved/articleshow/89190338.cms||---

---||Bhopal||Bhopal: Treatment sanction delay keeps gas-hit patients on tenterhooks||BHOPAL: Cancer patients among Bhopal gas victims are again facing problems to get sanction of the directorate of gas relief to continue their free treatment. This is happening ever since the gas relief department stopped clearing estimates of patients received from recognised hospitals like the Jawaharlal Nehru Cancer Hospital (JNCH) for treatment under a plan to get all the gas victims treated under Ayushman Yojana. The State cabinet has already approved a proposal for treatment of all the gas victims under Ayushman Yojana. A blood cancer patient, Arvind Chaudhary, while talking to TOI said that he needs blood transfusion every week and if it doesn't happen, the blood level in his body goes down and he starts having problems even in walking. He had submitted an estimate (which is given by hospitals from time to time) to the office of CMHO, gas relief, on January 18 and he was asked to come on January 21 to get the sanction letter but when he sent someone to get the sanction letter on January 25, the sanction letter was not ready. "We have a group on WhatsApp. Activist groups associated with gas victims are also there in the group. I wrote my problem in the group. Only after the matter was taken up with the authorities by the activist groups that blood transfusion could take place on Friday. Why should there be uncertainty like this? My condition deteriorated on Thursday as I was thinking all day whether blood transfusion would be possible tomorrow or not. We are half dead already. Why should we be put in a situation where our treatment gets discontinued, even if temporarily. If they are changing the system, let them change the system and then stop the old system of estimates and sanctions," he said. Mohd. Israr's father, Mune Miyan, who has throat cancer, has been recommended an MRI by the JNCH. Israr was asked by the staff of CMHO, gas relief, to get an estimate for MRI from Chirayu hospital. He had submitted the estimate on January 20 and was told then that sanction would come in a day or two but it has not happened till now while the condition of his father is deteriorating and the hospital (JNCH) also refuses to admit and treat him unless the MRI report is submitted. Director, gas relief, Basant Kurre, however, denied that cancer patients among gas victims are facing any problems in continuation of their treatment. When referred to Arvind Chaudhary's case, he said, "He was given blood on Friday".

While 83,365 tests were done on first day of the week, i.e. January 23 and 11,253 cases were reported. The tests reduced by nearly 14% on January 28 when only 71,313 tests were done in state. In the same period new cases reported in state also reduced by 31% to 7,763 new cases reported on January 28. Sources said that effectively owing to the reduction in number of tests by nearly 14%, the overall reduction in the new cases reported on January 28 compared to the first day of this week, is only around 16-17% (31%- 14%). The silver lining being, that despite reduction in number of tests done per day, there has been significant reduction in positivity rate in this week. Positivity rate is number of people found positive out of every 100 samples tested. It is inversely proportional to number of tests done, if more tests are done it is bound to reduce and if less tests are done it is likely to increase, but contrary to this, positivity rate has reduced despite reduction in tests, which shows are positive sign, added sources. On first day of this week, January 23, overall 13.4% positivity rate was reported, which means that out of every 100 samples tested on January 23, 13.4 people were found positive. This reduced to 10.8% on January 28.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/cases-drop-but-so-does-testing-positivity-dips-too/articleshow/89190355.cms||Amarjeet Singh
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: ‘LDF trying to wriggle out of 2 cases Lok Ayukta is set to hear’||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The state government is hurrying up with amendments to the Lok Ayukta Act through an ordinance only because the cases against the chief minister and the higher education minister are coming before the court, opposition leader V D Satheesan said here on Friday. “On February 1 and 4, the cases against the chief minister and the higher education minister will be taken up by the Lok Ayukta. The government is trying to make the amendments to the 22-year old Act only to escape from these two cases,” he said. Satheesan said that the LDF that did not utter a word against the Act for the past 22 years, is now citing the unconstitutionality of the Act when a case against the chief minister came before the Lok Ayukta. With regards to the arguments by CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan regarding the unconstitutionality in the Lok Ayukta Act, the opposition leader said that deciding the constitutionality of an Act is the job of the courts. “Supreme Court has made it very clear that only courts are empowered to declare that an Act is unconstitutional. A minister, a government or party leaders cannot rule whether an Act is unconstitutional or not,” he said. Satheesan added that the Supreme Court and the high court had considered Section 14 of the Act and did not find it unconstitutional. Regarding the need for seeking the President’s assent for the amendment, the opposition leader said that when the Act was passed in 1999, it had received the President’s assent. “When any major amendment that would change the very nature of the Act, it should be done only with the President’s assent. In 2013, the Centre had passed the Lokpal Act, and the LokAyukta Act is in tune with that Central act. So examining if there is any provision in Lok Ayukta Act that is against the provisions of the Central act can be done only through a Presidential scrutiny,” he said. Also, this matter falls in the concurrent list, which also makes it fit for presidential scrutiny, he added. He said that CPI state secretary Kanam Rajendran has stated that the ordinance was mysterious and Balakrishnan should explain the matter to Rajendran before educating others. “How can the executive function as an appellate authority on a judgment that was passed by jurists who were judges of the Supreme Court or the high court? All the defences being raised by the law minister are baseless,” Satheesan said. Recalling the article praising the Lok Ayukta two years ago, the opposition leader said that the chief minister, in his article in Chintha weekly, had found the Lok Ayukta Act as commendable and a powerful tool against corruption, but when a case against him came to the Lok Ayukta, he has decided to make it toothless.  “This amendment is nothing but the government’s attitude that it can do anything as it got re-elected,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/ldf-trying-to-wriggle-out-of-2-cases-lok-ayukta-is-set-to-hear/articleshow/89190356.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: Existential threat to govt won’t justify amendment, says CPI||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The CPI has further distanced from the CPM on the move to amend the Lok Ayukta Act. Party state secretary Kanam Rajendran on Friday said the move could not be justified just because it posed an existential threat to the government. If at all such a situation emerged, it should be fought by fielding people against it, he said. Rajendran was responding to CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan's arguments in an article published in the party mouthpiece on Friday. Balakrishnan had termed the amendment as a proactive step to foil the possible intervention by the central government to unsettle the state government by using the provisions in the act and the governor. "I'm yet to receive a reply to my question, what urgency forced the government to take an ordinance route to amend the act. Instances of removing the state government using governor is not something non-existent in the Indian context. It can happen in Kerala also," Rajendran said.  CPI state assistant secretary Prakash Babu also came out against Kodiyeri's arguments, saying they were not logical.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/existential-threat-to-govt-wont-justify-amendment-cpi/articleshow/89190357.cms||---

Already discussions with the leading agencies pertaining to digital transactions were held and working on the execution of the QR based cash transactions in all the HDBRTS bus stops. After the pandemic hit the nation, commuters have been demanding for cashless and digital transactions. As a result, the authorities are now working on the implementation of a digital payment system. Ganesh Rathod, deputy general manager, HDBRTS, said that earlier we thought of promoting cashless, contact less transactions to which people are now very used to, now we are planning to bring QR code based transactions in addition to the current system of contact less transactions. "In a couple of weeks the QR code based cash transaction system will be introduced in all the bus stops of HDBRTS to minimise cash-based transactions and encourage people to pay through e-wallets, like Google Pay or PhonePe. QR codes will be put up inside the bus through which people can pay.", he added. Ashwini, a bank employee of Keshwapur said, we claim that the HDBRTS has advanced features and service, but it's unfortunate that at the ticket counters there is still no digital payment system. "Recently I faced difficulty getting a ticket for Dharwad from Hubballi railway station, due to lack of adequate change to buy a ticket. Later I asked for the digital system, the staff sitting at the counter said that they don't have a digital payment system", he added. A staff at the ticket counter of HDBRTS, said most of the commuters come for a ticket with Rs 500, 200, but due to lack of change we are unable to give tickets sometimes. If the QR based cash transactions implemented at the bus stops, it would be easier for the public to get ticket, he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/bus-rapid-transit-system-to-start-qr-code-based-ticketing/articleshow/89187942.cms||J Abbas Mulla

He said that taluk level KDP meetings will be held from February. “People should not get an opportunity to blame officials with regard to government work.

---||Hubballi||Double blow for hospitality sector as Covid, polls in North India keep labourers away||Hubballi: Adding to the many problems that an already beleaguered hospitality sector in Hubballi-Dharwad is grappling with is the shortage in manpower that many establishments are facing. Migrant labourers from North Indian states constitute the bulk of the labour force in most of the eateries and hotels, and with elections scheduled in many of these states over the next two months, many employees have returned home to cast their vote. Unfortunately, this has only added to their woes since many employees who had gone home for Dasara and Deepavali have not returned to the twin cities, citing the spike in Covid-19 cases. Ramanand Sooda, officebearer of the Hubballi Hotel Association, said that there were around 15 people from Uttar Pradesh in his employ. “But none of them has returned to work after leaving for a festival. With the government curtailing our operations, we are also reluctant to ask them to return, and they are also disinclined to return. The state government has mandated that all employees in the hospitality industry be fully vaccinated, whereas many of our North Indian employees are yet to receive the second dose. The assembly elections in their home states has given them another reason to stay back. Most labourers from Uttar Pradesh arrive in groups, but most hotels are in no position to hire employees in large numbers. But we do hope that our employees return once the elections are over. Labourers from Uttar Pradesh and other North Indian states are very skilled in preparing Chinese food, in addition to delicacies of their home states,” Sooda said. Echoing Sooda’s observations, chief executive officer of The Hans Hotel Ajay Handa said, “Lucknow and Gorakhpur cities are hubs for chefs. Although election is one reason for their staying back, the predominant reason is the fear of Covid, now that the third wave is here. It has also been difficult for us to retain employees in the face of restrictions, while families are asking the labourers not to leave home.” Amarjeet, a chef at a star hotel on Gokul Road in Hubballi, is among those who has decided to stay back in his home in North India. Amarjeet said that he, along with many of his friends, had planned on returning to Karnataka in December. “But with the government imposing curbs on New Year celebrations, we decided to wait till Sankranthi, when the election calendar was announced. Many of us have secured part-time employment, and if the Election Commission lifts curbs by January 30, we may start earning well,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/double-blow-for-hospitality-sector-as-covid-polls-in-north-india-keep-labourers-away/articleshow/89187769.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

Birla said the twin-balance sheet problem of stressed loans and over-leveraged corporates is behind us and “we have upon us a forthcoming decade of ‘Capex Mahotsav’ in India”. Birla said a generation of entrepreneurs in India are now taking advantage of the 1991 economic reforms. The private sector, he added, is also firing on two-engines — the conventional and the new-economy. “I call it the ‘Double-engine growth’. Investors are excited about growth prospects in core sectors as well as sunrise sectors. In my view though, the word sunrise sector applies to the entire landscape in India, which includes both conventional sectors like cement, steel, power & auto and emerging areas like digital & renewables. Both hold the promise of high and sustained growth,” said Birla. With a work “awash in capital”, Birla said there has perhaps rarely been a better time to be an entrepreneur, as everyone from angel investors to the public markets line up to back ideas. “The competition for investment opportunities and the ‘fear of missing out’ (FOMO) have driven up valuations of many fledgling companies to stratospheric levels. Historically, the key question for any new business was whether it fulfilled an unmet consumer need. A hallmark of some new businesses today is that they seek to use the brute force of capital, combined with smart technology and operations, to create new needs that you did not even know existed! For example, is receiving groceries at your doorstep in less than 10 minutes a service that you cannot live without? Clearly many consumers think so,” said Birla. However, he added, “Ultimately, my own view is that at some stage unit economics will have to matter. And trusty old concepts like cash flows and gross margins will guide behaviour and actions. The only sustainable moat is the one based on intellect. Large waves of cheap capital will eventually erode all other entry barriers. From Aditya Birla Group’s experience in multiple businesses, across multiple geographies, I can say that in the long run sustainable and successful businesses are those that generate tangible profits, prosperity, livelihoods quarter after quarter. Valuation and business longevity will automatically follow.” In the note, which had a Zen-like tone to it, Birla said, “I often get asked how to deal with the highs and lows of life, and I think the biggest factor is equanimity. It is an acceptance that both adversity and windfall gains are impermanent. And that real success lies in the quiet acceptance of both. Equanimity helps one make sense of the vagaries of the world with the ability to dispassionately learn from the past and plan for the future. The deepest chasms are often a precursor to an impending improvement.” Birla said the exigencies of the pandemic have pushed the boundaries of innovation. While recognising the collective human endeavour that has generated astonishing outcomes that were achieved with 10 billion doses of the vaccine having been administered globally, he noted that it took several decades to develop and inoculate every child on the planet with the polio vaccine. “A world where traditional rules didn’t apply, freed thinking from its conventional shackles. And we are staring at an extraordinary decade,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/conventional-new-eco-engines-are-firing-pvt-sector-says-birla/articleshow/89188182.cms||---

According to deputy governor Michael Patra, the RBI has taken a contrarian stance by maintaining an accommodative stance to support growth even as other central banks are tightening, and the approach has served the country well. “India held its ground and is among a few countries that have retained an accommodative monetary policy, despite some views that we have fallen behind the curve. Only time will tell whether or not India has got it right but so far, this approach has served us well and helped in charting a course into the future which is different from the world,” said Patra. He was delivering the keynote address over video at the C D Deshmukh Memorial Lecture organised online by the Council for Social Development, Hyderabad. Patra said that RBI governor Shaktikanta Das had made 13 pandemic statements and the pandemic response was fashioned around a central anchor, “a leitmotif, if you will, that bound everything into a coherent whole”. “A recurring theme in several statements has been that the RBI’s policy measures ensured the lowest borrowing costs in nearly two decades and the highest maturity of the stock of public debt while ensuring the smooth passage of the borrowing programme.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/easy-money-approach-has-served-us-well-rbi/articleshow/89188379.cms||---

The fresh warning comes in the wake of unscrupulous elements innovating their modus operandi for frauds, including social media techniques. “Any phone call/email threatening the blocking of your account on the pretext of non-updation of KYC and suggestion to click a link for updating the same is a common modus operandi of fraudsters,” the RBI said in its note on safe digital banking practices. “Always access the official website of your bank/ NBFC/ e-wallet provider or contact the branch,” the note added. Reiterating the warning against sharing one-time passwords (OTPs) or card details, the central bank highlighted vishing, phishing and remote access as some of the common measures used by fraudsters. Vishing refers to phone calls from fraudsters aimed at luring customers into sharing their confidential details for either KYC, account activation, unblocking SIM cards or crediting money to customer accounts. Phishing frauds involve spoofed emails or SMS aimed at duping customers into believing that it has originated from their bank or e-wallet provider to extract confidential details. The other standard method is getting the customer to download an application for remote access on their mobile phones or computers to grant the fraudsters access. There have also been cases of the collect request feature of UPI being misused by sending fake collect requests and passing them off as payment messages.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbi-warns-public-on-kyc-frauds/articleshow/89188407.cms||---
---||Business||Bad bank takes off, to get Rs 50,000 crore of NPAs in FY22||MUMBAI: State Bank of India chairman Dinesh Khara on Friday said that the National Asset Reconstruction Company (NARCL) — the bad bank proposed to take over non-performing loans (NPLs) — has received all approvals to commence operations. He added that 15 loans worth Rs 50,000 crore from banks would be transferred to the NARCL by end of March 2022. These would be out of the NPLs worth Rs 82,425 crore that banks have agreed on. The announcement comes days before the Union Budget and nearly a year after the bad bank was announced by the finance minister in the Budget speech last year. Khara said that the India Debt Resolution Company (IDRCL), the entity that will seek to recover funds from these non-performing assets (NPAs), has also received all the requisite regulatory approvals. “There were certain concerns that were being raised in the media, but I am happy that both the entities have received approval,” said Khara. Introducing the management of the two firms, Khara said that NARCL will be managed by Padma Kumar Nair, while IDRCL will be headed by Manish Makharia. Nair was earlier chief general manager at SBI, while Makharia headed SBI Mutual Fund’s alternate investment funds vertical. SBI’s deputy MD Subroto Biswas will be the chairman of NARCL. Bankers said that earlier Pradip Shah, founder of IndAsia Fund Advisor, was selected for the chairman position at NARCL. Another private sector executive was also shortlisted for the CEO. Khara said while NARCL would be in the public sector, IDRCL will be majorly owned by private sector banks. There are several asset reconstruction companies, but the advantage NARCL would hold is that it would issue security receipts that are guaranteed up to 85% by the government as currency to acquire the bad loans. Khara said that most of the identified bad loans are provided for by banks. This means that they would not need to make additional provisions when they are sold to NARCL at fair value. Also, the security receipts will be considered zero-risk to the extent of the government guarantee and not attract capital requirements. Once the assets are transferred to NARCL, an asset-level trust will be formed for each loan account and the resolution of the account would be handled by IDRCL, which would only be a service company and not hold any assets on its books. In September last year, the government had announced guarantees worth Rs 30,600 crore to security receipts issued by NARCL. The guarantee is valid for five years, by which time the loans are expected to be resolved. IDRCL is expected to bring in expertise in resolution techniques and attract domestic as well as foreign investors.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/bad-bank-takes-off-to-get-rs-50000cr-of-npas-in-fy22/articleshow/89188385.cms||---

The latest obstacle before them is the third wave of Covid pandemic, which has affected their workforce as well as availability of raw materials.According to senior officials of NHAI in the district, the two projects – works of elevated highway at Kazhakootam and the Mukkola – Karode NH Bypass have been hit by the latest spike in the Covid cases. Many of their labourers too have tested positive for the Coronavirus.“The damage caused this time is not yet as severe as the one we faced during the second wave. However, it has still affected the pace of both the projects,’’ a senior official of NHAI said. Since, almost the entire workforce comprises guest labourers from other states, the contractors of both the projects have initiated steps to bring in replacements for those affected and are under quarantine. But, not many guest labourers are very keen on accepting the work here as the news regarding the third wave have made them reluctant. A similar situation was faced during the second wave too when more than half of the workforce were affected by the Covid.Another major obstacle before them is the non-availability of quarry materials, which are mostly imported from the neighbouring Tamil Nadu. Already, they were facing tussles in getting quarry materials from Tamil Nadu owing to the objections raised by various politicians there. Now, with the Covid situation turning severe, the tightened restrictions at the state border and the reluctance of those who own inter-state carriages transporting quarry materials have turned the situation worse.‘’We are hoping that the situation gets sorted out before it gets worse anymore. It is during the months between January and March normally most of the works are completed owing to favourable weather conditions. We are all the more upset because the third wave has struck during this exact window of period,’’ the officer said.Both the projects have been through a series of impediments ever since the pandemic era began. Soon after they resumed work following the first lockdown, the second wave hit. This was followed by the adverse weather conditions, involving heavy rains that affected the works for the major portion of the second half of 2021.The Mukkola – Karode project was hit again with the delay in securing a permit from the mining and geology department for mining of ordinary earth from Parasuvakkal village in Neyyattinkara taluk. Soon after they received the permit, they were dragged into court litigation after a private party raised an objection against the mining. Though the NHAI managed to secure a favourable interim order from the high court, the issue is yet to be sorted out.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/major-nhai-works-hit-by-covid-third-wave/articleshow/89190360.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: ‘No quarantine for those who come in contact with patient’||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Health minister Veena George has said there was no need for people who come into contact with Covid patients to undergo quarantine. Only caregivers of positive patients will have to go into quarantine, she said. The minister said the people in the state have been vaccinated, and the severity of the disease in the Omicron variant is very low. Hence there is no need for all people coming into contact to go into quarantine. For each wave of the pandemic, different strategies and precautions are being implemented depending upon the severity. The present phase of Omicron spread is less severe even though it spreads fast. “When compared to that of the previous weeks, the Omicron spread has started to come down. In the first week of January, the state witnessed a 45% increase in new cases. In the second week, it was 148%. When it came to the third week, it had increased to 215%. However, in the last week, it had come to 71%,” the minister said. However, she said that even though it is a relief, the next three weeks will be crucial. There are chances to peak in the coming weeks. The minister has sought voluntary service of retired doctors and other medical professionals to help the healthcare system of the state. Doctors who are willing to provide voluntary service should have a registered license from the medical council. Those who have temporary registration can also apply for this service. Their service will be required for two months, and the government will be giving a certificate for their voluntary service during the pandemic period. It has been decided to create a pool of such doctors willing to provide voluntary service, she added. All field staff working with the healthcare centres should be in constant touch with the Covid positive people. Details of these patients should be updated on a daily basis to the district control room, she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/no-quarantine-for-those-who-come-in-contact-with-patient/articleshow/89190362.cms||---

During the financial year 2020-21, about one lakh sq.ft of office space was allotted to 41 companies by Technopark. Besides, it is all set to allot 1,10,000 sq.ft space to another 30 companies soon. This move is expected to generate another 1,600 new jobs. Technopark is now home to 63,700 IT professionals in 465 companies with a total IT built up space of 10.6 million sq.ft as on date. During the pandemic, on the export revenue, Technopark has reasons to cheer as it clocked a Rs 611-crore jump in earnings in 2020-21 compared to the previous fiscal. Year 2020-21 saw exports bring Rs 8,501 crore from 460 companies as against Rs 7,890 crore from 450 companies the year before. In the last 20 months, the IT centre further strengthened its workforce by creating 1,700 more employment opportunities. “Global behemoths in the IT and related sectors have marked their presence in Technopark and helped in the overall development of Kerala and added to skill strengths. Committed to ensuring more job opportunities to the youth in Kerala, Technopark has succeeded in clocking a remarkable growth rate on all fronts,” said John M Thomas, CEO Kerala State IT Parks. The upcoming TCS Aerospace Hub in Technocity is envisaged as a development centre in space technologies, manufacturing and defence. The ‘live-work-play’ concept of development happening through Embassy-Taurus 'DownTown Trivandrum’ project in Technopark Phase III campus will see 57 lakhs sq.ft of built up space. The World Trade Centre, Thiruvananthapuram, by Brigade Enterprises at Technocity is another flagship project that will generate innumerable job opportunities in the sector. “The development outlook initiated right from the founding days has helped Technopark stand in good stead through these trying times of global pandemic. It is no small achievement that the progress continues even in this difficult period, creating more job opportunities and attracting more investments and new companies. All this has been the result of the timely guidance and support by the government and the concerted effort put in towards proper planning and implementation of projects by the stakeholders. Technopark and Kerala IT will pursue this and go further,” John M Thomas added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/technopark-created-over-1-5k-jobs-in-2021/articleshow/89190363.cms||---

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Four men held with ‘whale vomit’||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Palode forest range officials here on Thursday arrested four men who were in possession of ambergris, commonly known as ‘whale vomit’. According to the forest officials involved in the arrest, it is for the first time ambergris is being seized in the state capital. The contraband was seized from the residence of Shaji, 58, of Vellalloor near Kilimanoor. His associates, Sajeevan, 46, of Vellalloor, Baiju, 41, of Pazhaya Kunnummel and Radhakrishnan, 48, of Ulliyeri in Kozhikode, who were present in the house at the time of the raid, were also arrested along with him. The substance seized from them weighed five kilograms. Palode deputy forest officer Shiju S V Nair, who led the operation, said the gang had been in possession of ambergris for the past six months. Another person, who is yet to be identified, had handed over the substance to Shaji and gang on condition that they would receive a handsome amount as commission if they could find a good buyer. Officials conducted the raid after receiving a tip off in this regard. ‘’Shortly after they received the substance, another gang was held with ambergris in Thrissur. So the gang decided to lay low for some time,” Shiju S V Nair said. The officer added that the gang had since then approached a few potential buyers. They were hoping to get Rs 5-20 crore. Shaji worked in the construction sector and used to travel extensively. Hence he developed a lot of contacts all over the country. It is through one of those contacts he came in possession of ambergris. A probe is on to find the source of the ambergris. Ambergris is a waxy substance produced in the bile duct of sperm whales. Once the whale dies, the substance is expelled out of the body. It is used in the production of luxury perfumes and hence has high demand. But it is a punishable crime in the country to possess or sell ambergris.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/four-men-held-with-whale-vomit/articleshow/89190366.cms||---

The local bodies in the district have also been asked to set up help desks, control rooms and identify places for setting up the Covid first line and second line treatment centres.The decision was taken at a high-level meeting convened by ministers V Sivankutty, Antony Raju and G R Anil. In the meeting it was decided that all the local bodies should collect the exact number of patients in each ward and monitor from the help desks set up in the respective local bodies.In all wards a rapid response team will be set up who will be monitoring these patients. The local bodies were given instruction to start community kitchens in the places it was required. The Covid patients monitoring mechanism will be fully entrusted with the local bodies. The rapid response team should also ensure that all the children between the age group of 15 and 17 are vaccinated by collecting their details. The rapid response team also should ensure that medicines are adequately stocked in the health care centres of their region.The local bodies also should release sufficient funds to purchase the drugs and other essential commodities for the health care centres of their region. Steps have been taken to ensure that all those who have applied for the Covid compensation are receiving it. The meeting observed that those who have not applied for the compensation yet should apply at the earliest. For this all the village offices in the district will be working this Sunday.There is no BPL or APL divide in applying for getting this compensation and everyone is eligible for it.

Sources close to the development said under the initiative, the governments want to prevent ‘misadventures’ and fleecing of money by agents preying those with an ‘American Dream’. A member of the Gujarati community in Canada said that as part of the initiative, they will create awareness in the local community to not support such endeavours and also reach out to Gujarat, giving them a true and fair view of opportunities available in the Canada and the US. Meanwhile, the investigation has tried to piece together events that led to the tragedy. Canadian authorities said that the family arrived in Canada at Toronto on January 12 and made their way to Emerson, Manitoba, on January 18, a day before their deaths. The earlier theory that they may have walked for hours may also not hold true as officials found evidence of a vehicle dropping the group near the Canada-US border. Officials are treating the case as one of human smuggling. Investigating officers said that locals – employees at hotels, gas stations or restaurants – had interacted with the Patel family. The officials asked that anyone who had an interaction come forward with information.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/community-to-spread-awareness/articleshow/89190374.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Properties with over Rs 1 lakh pending tax to be sealed||AHMEDABAD: If your property tax exceeds Rs 1 lakh, it is time to pay up. The AMC’s revenue committee has decided to take punitive action including sealing the premises if the owners do not pay the pending dues. On the other hand, those who pay their taxes early will be rewarded with increased tax interest rebate. “We will be issuing notices to property owners whose pending tax exceeds Rs 1 lakh. If the amount is still not paid, we will seal their premises. On the other hand, we have decided to reward taxpayers who pay up in time,” said Jainik Vakil, chairman of AMC’s revenue committee. The committee has launched new scheme under which taxpayers will get more rebate if they pay their taxes early. Those who pay their property tax by the end of January will get 80% tax interest rebate for residential properties and 60% rebate for non-residential properties. Those who pay their tax in February will get 75% tax interest rebate for residential properties and 55% for non-residential. Those who pay their taxes in March will get 70% interest rebate for residential and 50% for non-residential properties. “Tax payers whose properties are located in chawls and slums will continue getting 100% tax interest rebate if they pay their taxes in January-March period,” Vakil said. He added that between January 1 and 27, 65,767 citizens have paid their taxes and benefited from the tax rebate scheme. During April 1 to January 27 period this financial year, the civic body’s total tax revenue collection stood at Rs 1,076 crore, of which Rs 814 crore has been collected in property tax, Rs 158 crore in professional tax while Rs 104 crore has been collected in vehicle tax. Vakil said that the department has also approached the state finance ministry and requested it to grant it powers to make decisions related to professional tax. “Any local self-government institutions carry out only tax collection, they don’t have powers to make administrative decisions like waiving off interest. These powers lie with the state commercial department. We have approached the state finance ministry and requested it to grant decision making powers to civic bodies,” Vakil said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/properties-with-over-1l-pending-tax-to-be-sealed/articleshow/89190377.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||High court mulls treated effluents’ course||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Friday said that it will take a decision on whether industrial units can be permitted to discharge their effluents into sewage lines after treating them at their effluent treatment plants (ETPs). The court will also decide whether the units can release, as a matter of right, their treated trade effluents into the civic body’s sewerage network. The issue arose after the high court ordered severing of illegal drainage connections of industrial units which discharge effluents into sewage lines. As many as 393 such illegal connections have been severed. More than a dozen industrial units, mostly textile units such as Arvind Ltd, Ashima Ltd and others, moved court against the disconnections. They want permission to discharge their effluents from their ETPs into the AMC’s sewage lines. On Friday, the HC-appointed Joint Task Force (JTF) submitted a report on the inspection of eight ETPs of textile units. Amicus curiae Hemang Shah said that all the ETPs inspected were found to be in a very bad shape. The characterization was fiercely resisted by the industries. But this revelation led the bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice V D Nanavati to question the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB). “Why did you not bring this (condition of ETPs) to the notice of the high court?” the court said. “The GPCB owes an answer to us.” The high court also said that the industrial units were making tall claims that their ETPs were functioning properly. The HC questioned the GPCB’s inspections. “The obligation upon you (GPCB) is very heavy. It is really very unfortunate that the condition of these ETPs has come on record after Joint Task Force’s visit,” the court said. “You (GPCB) are also a part of the JTF, but why was the Board silent on this till now?” The court further pulled up the GPCB saying that the discharge of improperly treated effluents from industrial units led to the corrosion of the AMC’s sewage treatment plants. “Now the AMC has to spend more than Rs 500 crore to repair STPs,” the court said. “It has to seek funds from the World Bank because of lack of funds with it.” The HC reserved its order on the industrial units’ applications for allowing the release of treated effluents into the AMC’s sewerage network. Meanwhile, a pharmaceutical unit from Khokhra, Shree Krishna Keshav Laboratories Ltd, filed an application after the AMC severed its drainage connection on January 7. The GPCB informed the court that it has issued the closure order for this unit. The court has posted a hearing on this application on February 4.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/high-court-mulls-treated-effluents-course/articleshow/89190379.cms||---

The terminal will serve as a dedicated point of transit for passengers taking chartered flights, VIP movements, and other non-scheduled operations. Being the hub of business and finance, Ahmedabad is a key destination for non-scheduled operations and private flights. At least seven chartered flight movements take place at the SVPI airport in Ahmedabad daily. The same has reduced to about five over the past few days in the wake of declined movement due to the surge in Covid-19 cases. With the setting up of the new terminal, passengers travelling via scheduled flights would not be bothered at time of VIP movements and flight schedules will remain unhampered, confirmed sources. The new facility will enable faster turnaround time for business jets and chartered aircraft, saving passengers the trouble of competing for taxing slots with commercial flights in general passenger terminals. The new terminal has passenger lounges, a duty-free store, F&B section, 24x7 personal concierge services, common processing area with customs and immigration as well as immediate access to private jet aircraft stands from the terminal. The facilities also include an access control system, Wi-Fi enabled services, IT system integrated with overall Ahmedabad airport's platform, and perimeter security control system to provide a rich and personalized experience to the passengers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/dedicated-general-aviation-terminal-inaugurated-at-airport/articleshow/89190380.cms||---

His nephew’s wife, Fizu Patel, had accused them of domestic violence, kidnapping, illegal confinement and criminal conspiracy. Sources said that Fizu has given her consent to Dashrath’s request to the court regarding this matter. He has sought discharge in Section 307 of IPC, citing that there is no evidence against him in this regard. A court in Mirzapur is hearing Dashrath’s discharge application. Apart from Dashrath, Fizu’s husband Maunang Patel, his mother, and one more accused in this case, Virendra Patel, have also filed discharge applications in this case. These pleas are awaiting consideration. The attempted murder charge was slapped against Dashrath, his elder brother Raman Patel and Virendra at a later stage when there was a meeting for compromise between Fizu and the accused persons. On August 16, 2020, Fizu filed a complaint against her husband and in-laws accusing them of assault, attempt to murder, torture and dowry harassment. She told with Vastrapur police that she had been assaulted by her husband on August 1, on the day of her daughter’s birthday. She also alleged that her father-in-law, Raman, had inappropriately touched her in the past and her mother-in-law had tortured her for dowry. After Fizu’s complaint, Raman Patel faced half-a-dozen land grabbing cases. He has been granted bail in four cases, but the Gujarat high court on Thursday said that it was not inclined to grant him bail in connection with two such cases.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/murder-bid-dashrath-seeks-discharge/articleshow/89190381.cms||---

The slide occurred when five labourers were digging for a basement at the redevelopment site of Janak Apartments. The mudslide happened suddenly and a heap of earth from the retaining wall caved in, trapping them underneath, said an officer of Ahmedabad fire and emergency services (AFES). Three workers succeeded in escaping while two were trapped. An AFES team was called for a rescue operation and four vehicles of the fire brigade with 40 personnel rushed to the spot and began rescue work. AFES personnel extricated two labourers — Javsingh Damor, 45, a native of Jhalod in Dahod district and Patu Kayami, 25, from Garbada — who were unconscious. They were rushed to Sola Civil Hospital but died during treatment. Damor and Kayami had been in the city for one-and-a-half month for work. “On Friday morning, we were waiting at the kadia naka (labour market) in Naranpura. We were approached by a contractor for digging work at the old Janak Apartments site. We were promised Rs 400 a day for the work,” said Dinesh Damor, who worked with the deceased. He said that the two could escape the mudslide and were trapped. The families of the deceased labourers reached Sola Civil Hospital and their bodies will be taken back to their native places for their last rites.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/two-labourers-killed-in-mudslide-at-naranpura-site/articleshow/89190383.cms||---

In her FIR with Chandkheda police on Friday, the woman said that she got married to a man from Kota in Rajasthan on February 25, 2020. At that time, she had told her husband and in-laws that she would like to pursue studies after marriage and they agreed to it. However, after she moved to her in-laws’ place in Kota, they would not let her study, citing various reasons, she alleged. When she was about to appear for the exam in August 2020, after it was postponed due to the pandemic and the subsequent lockdown, her husband asked her to take the online exam instead of appearing for the test in person. Meanwhile, the woman conceived and asked her husband to drop her off at her parents’ place so that she could study and appear for the BCom exam. Her exam was scheduled for October 26, 2020 but that day her mother-in-law and sister-in-law reached her parents’ house in Chandkheda to take her back to Kota. When she insisted that she would go with them after taking the exam, the women allegedly thrashed her. She said that that they asked her parents to give them Rs 8 lakh-10 lakh as dowry if they wanted her to live with her husband. The complainant alleged that she suffered a miscarriage due to the thrashing and was admitted to a hospital in Chandkheda. However, neither her husband nor the in-laws came to meet her. She then filed a complaint of domestic violence against them.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/my-husband-in-laws-did-not-let-me-take-bcom-exam/articleshow/89190390.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Three arrested for Dhandhuka murder||AHMEDABAD: Ahmedabad rural police on Friday announced that they have arrested the two alleged shooters and a cleric, who was allegedly involved in the conspiracy, for the killing of a 27-year-old man in Dhandhuka on Tuesday. According to police officers, the shooters were identified as Sabbir Chopda, 25, and Imtiyaz Pathan, 27, both residents of Dhandhuka. Police officers said the cleric, Maulana Mohammed Ayyub Javrawala, 51, a resident of Jamalpur in Ahmedabad, allegedly conspired in the murder and gave a revolver to the shooters, with which Chopda shot Kishan Bharwad. “On January 25, at around 5pm, Chopda and Pathan followed Bharwad on their motorcycle and fired two rounds at him. One bullet hit Bharwad and he died on the spot,” said a police officer. After the murder, the Ahmedabad rural SP formed teams of the local crime branch, special operations group and local police to nab the shooters. Police gathered CCTV footage of the crime scene and identified the accused, who were seen riding their motorcycle parallel to Bharwad and shooting him. Cops nabbed the two on Thursday. They revealed that the killing was an act of revenge as Bharwad had made objectionable posts on social media about Islam. On January 9, an FIR was filed against Bharwad for allegedly criticizing people of a certain religion and sharing videos and photos of decapitation. Bharwad made objectionable remarks about certain religious figures and said in his social media post that people are not allowed to make comments about a certain religion. Bharwad was arrested in the case and was later released. The accused then allegedly decided to kill Bharwad for his objectionable comments against Islam. In the second week of January, Chopda and Pathan met Javrawala and plotted to kill Bharwad, said a police officer. “Javrawala gave the two a pistol and five cartridges during their meeting at Jamalpur and sent them back to Dhandhuka to kill Bharwad. Chopda and Pathan returned to Dhandhuka, and staked out Bharwad for four days before carrying out the killing,” said the officer. Police officers said Chopda had a year ago contacted a cleric in Delhi through Instagram and met him in Mumbai nine months ago. That cleric introduced Chopda to Javrawala and told Chopda what action could be taken against persons who make objectionable comments against Islam. In October, the cleric from Delhi came to the Shah-e-Alam area of the city, where Chopda and Javrawala met him, police officers said. The two alleged shooters were booked for murder and criminal conspiracy along charges under the Arms Act. They were produced before a court and sent to police custody for nine days. Javrawala was arrested on Friday evening.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/three-arrested-for-dhandhuka-murder/articleshow/89190400.cms||---

On December 22, AMC issued eviction notices to 270 units located between Limda Chowk and Macchi Bazaar in Rakhial, for road widening work stipulated in the town planning scheme.  Against this eviction bid, the city president of AIMIM, Shamshad Pathan, filed a PIL seeking protection against eviction of these poor citizens without rehabilitation. His advocate, S H Iyer, claimed that people have been residing living in the area for more than 30 years and are entitled to benefit under the rehabilitation scheme. The bench of Chief Justice Aravind Kumar and Justice Ashutosh Shastri said the court will protect the interests of inhabitants of 125 residential units and asked the AMC for a rehabilitation plan. The civic body said it would consider giving alternative accommodation on seeing their eligibility. The court ordered the AMC not to begin an eviction drive at present and asked the residents to file an affidavit by February 2 in court that they will give up possession of their houses once the AMC gives them alternative accommodation and shifts them to the new place. The court made it clear that the residents will make a representation to the AMC for alternative arrangement in 10 days and in the next three weeks, the corporation should take a decision on granting alternative accommodation after scrutinizing their documents to see if they are entitled to benefits of the rehabilitation scheme.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/hc-comes-to-rescue-of-slum-dwellers-tells-amc-to-provide-shelter/articleshow/89190401.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat HC issues contempt notice to judge||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court has given the contempt of court notice to a judicial officer for issuing an arrest warrant despite the high court’s stay order on criminal proceedings. The alleged contemnor in this case is a judicial magistrate first class posted in Vaso court in Kheda district, R K Trivedi. The petitioner is Jayantibhai Chauhan, who along with his two brothers is an accused in a case of abetment to suicide and domestic violence. The FIR in the case was registered with Vaso police in 2015. After Chauhan was arrested and released on bail, he approached the high court for quashing of the FIR lodged against him and his family members. On August 24, 2015, the high court ordered the lower court to stay the criminal proceedings. Because of the stay order, the case was not committed to the sessions court for trial. However, on July 6, 2019, JMFC Trivedi issued a non-bailable warrant against Chauhan and his brothers. Chauhan and one of his brothers, Laljibhai, were arrested and produced before the court on July 16, 2019. Chauhan informed the court that the HC had already stayed the case. The judicial officer granted them bail on the same day, but since Laljibhai could not arrange the surety, he was sent to jail and had to remain in jail for a day until he could present the surety. Disturbed with the arrest despite the HC’s stay order, Chauhan approached the high court through advocate Darshit Bhrambhatt, who submitted that the high court’s stay order was duly communicated to the lower court in December 2015. The advocate said there is a procedure in law to secure the presence of an accused and the issuance of the non-bailable warrant is the last stage after the court issues notice, summons, and a bailable warrant. The advocate said that in this case, the judicial officer wilfully disobeyed the HC’s direction and issued the arrest warrant and committed contempt of court. The bench of Chief Justice Aravind Kumar and Justice Ashutosh Shastri issued the notice to the judge on Thursday and posted further hearing on March 4.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/hc-issues-contempt-notice-to-judge/articleshow/89190407.cms||---

The MoU got a nod of the cabinet on January 19 paving the way for targeted initiatives and hand holding of major stakeholders in the state by experts of just transition.Director, India Just Transition Centre (IJTC) at iForest, Srestha Banerjee, said iForest has been working in Jharkhand over the past few years. “Working for District Mineral Foundation (DMF), we developed indicative models for five districts — Dhanbad, Bokaro, Ramgarh, Chatra and West Singhbhum — to help the districts make best use of available funds in improving the life of mines-affected people. Later in 2020, we also stated working in the field of clean energy transition,” she said, adding that under the present MoU, funds available under DMF would be utilised in ensuring seamless transition from traditional energy sources to cleaner and renewables.According to a study conducted by climate activist and scholar University of British Columbia, Sandeep Pai, the local district governments in Jharkhand collected nearly Rs 800 crore under the District Mineral Foundation (DMF) in 2020. “The DMF is a levy on coal production collected directly by district governments and is meant to be used for local projects to enhance health, education, and rural development. According to DMF rules, district governments should collect a DMF of 30% of the royalty paid to the state government for coal mines operational before January 2015 and 10% for those operational after. The royalty itself is calculated based on the price of coal, with higher-quality coal resulting in a higher price. These differences result in different districts collecting different amounts of funds under the DMF,” he said.Agreeing that huge funds available under DMF often remain underutilised, Banerjee said the potential of DMF fund is huge. “We have been working in various districts of Jharkhand on DMF and we look forward to continuing the work. More than Rs 7,600 crore have accrued in the DMFs in the state in the past years. We are also working on just transition in the state,” she said.iForest CEO Chandra Bhushan expressed happiness over signing of the MoU. “We are very happy that the government of Jharkhand is keen on improving the implementation of DMF to benefit the mining-affected communities and improve the social economic and environmental conditions of the mining districts. The government has shown interest in supporting a just energy transition for which we are ready to provide best possible support,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/pact-to-ease-transition-from-traditional-to-clean-energy/articleshow/89190430.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

Demanding re-opening of schools since long, Dreze now feels that the education gap must be filled by adopting some extraordinary ways, otherwise the poor and rural children would be the worst sufferers.“The worst aspect of the crisis we are facing today is not the economic crisis or even the health crisis, it is the schooling crisis. When the pandemic subsides, the economy is likely to pick up and adults will return relatively soon to their normal lives. But children may pay the price for their entire life. A small minority of privileged children have been able to continue studying online during this period, but online education does not work for poor children. Most of them have been virtually abandoned by the schooling system for two years,” he has pointed in the letter.Proposing the Tamil Nadu model in which the state government has launched a scheme titled Illam Thedi Kalvi (ITK) to rope in over one lakh volunteers and engage them in bridging the educational gap by volunteering to spend a few hours everyday with the students of class 1 to VIII. “Primary schools in Jharkhand have remained closed for more than two years, longest period anywhere in the world and when the children return to schools, many among them would have lost the ability to even read or write simple sentences,” Dreze said, quoting the findings of Emergency Report On School Education released in September last year.Though there was no official response to the letter from CMO, sources in the school education and literacy department said that the departmental minister Jagarnath Mahto has summoned the secretary, school education and literacy, for a meeting on Saturday. Mahato is likely to discuss the modalities of reopening schools, a proposal regarding which will be tabled before the state disaster management authority, which is scheduled to meet on Monday. Mahato has hinted that he is personally of the view that schools should be re-opened with due diligence so as to not put the children at risk.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/try-tn-model-to-fill-up-kids-study-gap-dreze-to-govt/articleshow/89190431.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

Moreover, to ensure the timely lifting and distribution of kerosene oil by the wholesalers and the PDS shops, the process of online kerosene allocation system will be launched in the state on February 1.The app, indigenously developed by the department, will capture latitude and longitude of the foodgrain distribution as well as the photograph of the beneficiaries. The data will be available on the departmental portal on realtime basis which can be verified in case of any complaint.With a total of 24,408 PDS shops functioning in the state, 856 of them are working in the offline mode due to poor network connectivity in some of the remote areas of the state. However, the state government is also running particularly vulnerable tribal groups (PVTG), Daakia scheme, in which foodgrains are delivered to the doorstep of the beneficiaries. However, due to the non-availability of network at their dwellings, the items are physically distributed.The offline mode has its set of challenges. The department is unable to get any realtime data. Further, the complaints regarding the non-distribution of foodgrains to the beneficiaries at the designated place has always been a matter of concern for the department following which it has come up with the realtime monitoring app.Further, the kerosene allocation systemwas a pilot programme in Ramgarh district which was started in April last year. The department has decided to expand the programme to the different districts of the state. The allocation system will ensure realtime monitoring of kerosene allotment and ferrying from the state depots to the PDS shops. The online report of all the activities of all the stakeholders can also be monitored.After kerosene is lifted by the wholesaler from the oil depot, the PDS shops concerned will immediately get the designated place, date and time to lift the kerosene through SMS, which will ultimately save time and labour.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/aahar-suvidha-app-to-ensure-pds-clarity-online-kerosene-from-feb-1/articleshow/89190433.cms||---

Das, in a press conference at the Ranchi Press Club, said: “All the illegal mining activities across Jharkhand are being carried under the watch of the family which is in power in the state in a well organised manner.” Das claimed that the incumbent Hemant Soren government did not auction off the sand ghats of the state for two years so that illegal sand mining can be carried out unabated. “Our government had sought expressions of interest from companies to ensure organised sand mining and successful companies had been shortlisted as well. But the government changed and the allotment of ghats were suspended indefinitely,” Das alleged. Das claimed that one Grand Mining Company, of which Basant is an owner, shipped out 5 lakh tonne stone chips through railway freight train through the Pinar Ghatiya siding October last year. “Crores of state revenue were lost as the consignment was sent without a valid mining challan. Nothing can be shipped out from the railway sidings in Dumka without the consent of the local MLA’s aides. They have floated two mining companies and all the indents have to be in their names,” Das alleged. Das, who is also the BJP’s national vice president, claimed that illegal passing zones have been set up in the area to ship out illegally mined stone and sand through Sahebganj, where Hemant’s MLA representative (Pankaj Mishra) calls the shots. He even alleged that coal mafias are not allowing PSU coal companies to transport the coal from their mines and livestock were being smuggled to Bangladesh from Santhal Pargana unabated. Das, who has been recently criticising Hemant as ‘Babua’ and his government as ‘Abua Sarkar’, also alleged that the incumbent government misled the court’s orders in the Shah Brothers case by concealing the actual status of the penalty the company owed to the government.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/das-govt-patronising-illegal-mining-in-santhal-pargana/articleshow/89190436.cms||---

It’s then possible that Indore won’t participate for the sixth time and will be kept out of the contest by giving ‘Iconic City’ title”, Sharma had mentioned.While talking to TOI, the divisional commissioner had said that Bhopal-based senior officials had recently informed him about chances of Indore being kept out from Swachh Survekshan 2022 by providing the title of ‘Iconic City’ to guide other cities in the field of sanitation. “It’s however a process and not the decision, possibility of which seems very less as IMC has received a toolkit to compete in the nationwide contest” he said. As part of Swachh Survekshan 2022, IMC has already started working on improving the air quality of Indore and has even fulfilled some of the parameters of the toolkit TNN||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/indore/no-proposal-to-keep-indore-out-of-swachh-race/articleshow/89190445.cms||---

The minister started his temple run by visiting Kadri Sri Manjunatha Temple, followed by offering prayers at Sri Mangaladevi Temple and Kudroli Sri Gokarnanatha Temple. He later visited the Dakshina Kannada BJP office. Speaking after being felicitated by party workers at the district BJP office, he called upon the BJP workers to work towards the victory of the BJP candidates, in all the eight assembly constituencies in Dakshina Kannada, in the next assembly election. “We need to get ready for the elections to be held for zilla panchayat and taluk panchayat elections. There is a need to strengthen the party at the grassroots level in the district. The party workers should create awareness on the welfare schemes of the government, among the people. An action plan for permanent development works in Dakshina Kannada will be chalked out after consulting the MLAs in the district,” he said. He added, “Ours is a pro-Hindu and pro-Hindutva government. The government has already passed the Prevention of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Act, and also announced its decision on providing autonomy to temples. Congress leaders are in an illusion, and there is a feeling of insecurity among them. They are trying to politicise the issue of the Sri Narayana Guru tableau and Mekedatu project. Karnataka will be able to present the Sri Narayana Guru tableau in next year’s Republic Day celebrations, if the central government announces a spiritual theme.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/strengthen-bjp-at-grassroots-level-sunil-kumar/articleshow/89187226.cms||---

The latest obstacle before them is the third wave of Covid pandemic, which has affected their workforce as well as availability of raw materials. According to senior officials of NHAI in the district, the two projects – works of elevated highway at Kazhakootam and the Mukkola – Karode NH Bypass have been hit by the latest spike in the Covid cases. Many of their labourers too have tested positive for the Coronavirus. “The damage caused this time is not yet as severe as the one we faced during the second wave. However, it has still affected the pace of both the projects,’’ a senior official of NHAI said. Since, almost the entire workforce comprises guest labourers from other states, the contractors of both the projects have initiated steps to bring in replacements for those affected and are under quarantine. But, not many guest labourers are very keen on accepting the work here as the news regarding the third wave have made them reluctant. A similar situation was faced during the second wave too when more than half of the workforce were affected by the Covid. Another major obstacle before them is the non-availability of quarry materials, which are mostly imported from the neighbouring Tamil Nadu. Already, they were facing tussles in getting quarry materials from Tamil Nadu owing to the objections raised by various politicians there. Now, with the Covid situation turning severe, the tightened restrictions at the state border and the reluctance of those who own inter-state carriages transporting quarry materials have turned the situation worse. ‘’We are hoping that the situation gets sorted out before it gets worse anymore. It is during the months between January and March normally most of the works are completed owing to favourable weather conditions. We are all the more upset because the third wave has struck during this exact window of period,’’ the officer said. Both the projects have been through a series of impediments ever since the pandemic era began. Soon after they resumed work following the first lockdown, the second wave hit. This was followed by the adverse weather conditions, involving heavy rains that affected the works for the major portion of the second half of 2021. The Mukkola – Karode project was hit again with the delay in securing a permit from the mining and geology department for mining of ordinary earth from Parasuvakkal village in Neyyattinkara taluk. Soon after they received the permit, they were dragged into court litigation after a private party raised an objection against the mining. Though the NHAI managed to secure a favourable interim order from the high court, the issue is yet to be sorted out.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/major-nhai-works-hit-by-covid-third-wave/articleshow/89188092.cms||---

The court granted permission on the basis of the report submitted by the medical board constituted at AIIMS. The board reported that a woman has 27-week pregnancy and was suffering from anencephaly, open neural tube defect and kyphoscoliosis in the foetus, which is incompatible with life. Justice V. Kameswar Rao, in the recent order, said, “'I am of the considered view that in the light of the opinion given by the Medical Board, continuing the pregnancy shall be a great hardship to the petitioner and upon that her extreme amount of mental, emotional and even financial distress.” He said, “No doubt, there are certain risks to the petitioner, considering and noting the medical opinion given by the board, the compelling reasons for petitioner to seek permission to end her pregnancy can be understood.” ANI||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/hc-allows-termination-of-27-week-pregnancy/articleshow/89188709.cms||---

According to officials, though the number of calls has also reduced to almost half in the past few days, around 1,000 people call the number every day for information about vaccination and hospital beds, and to consult doctors to discuss their symptoms and take advice on medicines. The data compiled by the health department of the Delhi government suggests that the helpline gets maximum calls for teleconsultation with doctors, followed by those for information on precautionary doses and vaccines for children. From just two calls on January 1, the number went up to 2,041 by January 12, when the positivity rate crossed 25%. The numbers have been steadily coming down since then, and on January 25, 983 calls were received. “Since the symptoms of Omicron, the new Covid strain found in almost 80% of the patients now, are similar to those of seasonal cold and flu, most people seek information regarding that through teleconsultation. The callers also ask if any medicine is available to cure Covid or if the vaccination can treat the infection completely,” said an official. Managed by the call centre of a firm engaged by the government’s administrative reforms department, the 24x7 helpline is based out of Noida. “It is currently managed by 25 operators with 150 phone lines. The call centre is conducting training for 15 more executives who can be deployed in case there is a surge in the number of calls,” said an official associated with 1031. While the operators are trained to answer frequently asked questions (FAQs) on Covid-19, the consultation calls are transferred to doctors. “The FAQs on various aspects of people’s concern are prepared and regularly updated in consultation with the departmental heads concerned,” he said. As per the government data, 66 doctors attend to the teleconsultancy calls in four different shifts. Currently, most doctors — 23 — are available in the afternoon shift (noon to 6pm), followed by 20 in the morning shift (6am to noon), and 19 in the evening between 6pm and midnight. Four doctors are there for the night shift.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/cases-down-but-covid-helpline-still-getting-1000-calls-a-day/articleshow/89188723.cms||Atul Mathur

The district has been witnessing this stagnation for the last two weeks. The week-to-week analysis of Covid-19 infections in the district for the last one month showed that the district touched the highest 16,907 infections in the January 15-21 week with a maximum 21.09% positivity rate. In the current week January 22-28, the infection dipped slightly to 15,673 with a positivity rate of 20.17% that is on a lower side than earlier week. Community medicine HoD MGMMC Dr Salil Sakalle told TOI, “Covid-19 has witnessed a stagnation in infections with the curve tilting slightly downwards implying the district being in peak phase in the last two weeks.” “The downward trends further showed that pandemic virus infection is heading towards plateau from peak”, Dr Sakalle said. “The trends of metropolitan cities like Delhi, Mumbai showed that the district would also witness sharp decline as it spiked during the third wave. The chances of plateauing of peak/ ending of the third wave in next seven to 10 days are high”, Dr Sakalle added. On the question of less daily infections than expected Dr Sakalle said, “There are many people who don’t undergo testing despite having symptoms because of symptoms like cold and cough. The positives from self-testing kits are also not known in the third wave.” The district in the third wave so far reported a maximum of 3372 on January 22 in the third wave that began to spike from mid-December last year with substantial increase being recorded from last week. TOI on January 12 reported that the projections showed that Covid-19 infection may peak between January last week to February mid in Madhya Pradesh.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/indore/high-chances-that-third-wave-may-end-in-7-10-days/articleshow/89190449.cms||Antriksh Singh

The driver was removed from the job on health authorities’ directions. The woman identified as Kusubai, resident of village chotipol, went to a tubectomy camp in Bhabra on Thursday. She along with other women of the area were sent to their house on a private ambulance from the camp. The driver had however allegedly demanded Rs 300 from her. When she refused, the driver dropped her two and a half kilometres before her house in the village. CMHO Alirajpur Dr Prakash Dhoke told TOI, “The matter came to light on Thursday night through social media. The aggrieved family members however don’t file any complaint with us.” “The driver was removed from operating the ambulance after the controversy over directions. There is no provision for transporting people for tubectomy”, said Dr Dhoke. “On Thursday evening, there were a couple of females for tubectomy in the camp and the weather was very cold, so the BMO asked the private ambulance to drop them at their house”, said Dr Dhoke. The driver dropped him two and a half kilometres before her house because the road wasn’t proper for movement of the ambulance. He then dropped them with another four-wheeler to their house, added Dr Dhoke. “The ambulance service is run by an NGO that doesn’t charge anything from the patients”, added Dr Dhoke.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/indore/ambulance-driver-demands-300-extra-leaves-woman-patient-midway/articleshow/89190452.cms||---

Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) is planning to revise its penalising policy, wherein instead of compounding the interest on the dues each month, the civic agency has proposed to charge a monthly interest of just 1% on unpaid dues. MCC has submitted the proposal to the government, and is awaiting its nod.MCC is currently grappling with an acute shortage of funds, funds it desperately needs to complete various development projects. Since collection of unpaid dues will help fill its coffers, the civic agency has adopted a multi-pronged strategy to persuade residents to settle outstanding bills. The new proposal by the MCC comes close on the heels of the state government rejecting its earlier plan to charge no interest on dues.“Our idea is to help residents who owe the MCC a hefty amount in unpaid dues. We will take a decision on this issue at the meeting of the MCC Council. The Mysuru MP and district in-charge minister have both suggested that we change the existing system. But for any change in policy to be implemented, the government must first give its nod,” said Mysuru mayor Sunanda Palanethra.MCC authorities said that outstanding payment on water bills totalled up to Rs 146 crore, which had accumulated an interest of Rs 73 crore. While 270 million litres of water is supplied to the residents of Mysuru city daily, only 160 million litres are accounted for, while the remaining water is being used through illegal connection. A recent survey by the officials of Vani Vilas Water Works pegged the number of houses being supplied water without a meter at 49,950.MCC authorities said that, should the state government give its nod for the new policy, it would come into effect from the 2022-23 fiscal year.Mysuru MP Pratap Simha is among those who is in favour of waiving interest on unpaid dues. However, the state government appears to be at variance with the MP on the issue.On the other hand, residents want the MCC to streamline tax collection, which they believe will help the civic agency achieve its revenue targets. “Unpaid dues, whether it is property tax, electricity bill, et al, pose a huge challenge to the MCC. Given that only one section of the people in Mysuru are paying their bills regularly, the MCC must ensure that every household falls in line,” said Prashanth Nagar resident Sundar Raj.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/mcc-moots-new-plan-to-collect-water-bill-dues/articleshow/89190456.cms||---

---||Mysuru||Protest over delay in road repair||Mysuru: The Mysuru City Corporation is facing criticism for its failure to repair damaged roads in the city despite several protests various organisations and residents about the pothole-ridden roads. The city roads were badly damaged due to incessant rains which lashed in October last year. Mysuru Pragnavantha Vedike activists recently protested against the civic body for failing to repair the damaged roads. The protesters alleged that the death of a motorbike rider near Rama Mandira on Kantharaja Urs Road was due to the huge craters on the road. After the problem was discussed several times in MCC council meetings, mayor Sunanda Palanetra had appealed to the state government for a grant of Rs 50 crore. Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai too had agreed to release Rs 25 crore in the first phase and asked to prepare an action plan. Sunanda told TOI that some corporators had urged the deputy commissioner to stop the action plan to repair roads under the grants released by the government alleging disparity in the distribution of funds for wards after a senior politician intervened. “People, especially senior citizens suffer the most due to bad roads. Now, there is unnecessary opposition for the good work which I had planned for the city. I have again requested the CM to grant the funds to take up road repairs in all wards,” she said. Almost all the roads in the city have been damaged badly and have become a nightmare for commuters. MCC commissioner G Lakshmikanth Reddy told TOI that the work shall be taken up in all the 65 wards. “Tenders have been called for all 65 wards and tenders have been approved in 58 wards. Work to begin shortly. Each ward will get Rs 10 lakhs for road repair,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/protest-over-delay-in-road-repair/articleshow/89190458.cms||---

Nagendra sought to know who would bear the cost of repairing roads that would be dug up for laying pipes for the project.Defending Ramadas’s concerns about the extent of damage that digging up roads for the gas pipelines would cause, Nagendra said, “A sum of Rs 99 crore has been set aside for repair of roads dug up for the project, but fixing the damaged roads will cost at least Rs 300 crore. We cannot allow the roads to be dug up for laying pipelines to supply natural gas. Will the MP fill up the potholes, and repair the roads that will be dug up once the project is completed? Corporators have also expressed concerns over gridlock that may result once work on the project gets under way. On the whole, roads extending up to 500km will have to be dug up for the project.”Nagendra attributed Simha’s margin of victory in the Lok Sabha polls to the absence of a JD(S) candidate in the fray. “BJP corporators and MLAs campaigned tirelessly for the party, which helped Simha win the election. Why has the MP failed in getting the Centre to include Mysuru in the ‘Smart Cities’ project, although the city fulfils all criteria? It is not enough to quote Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He should speak about initiatives he has undertaken to improve the standard of living of the people of Mysuru,” said Nagendra.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/will-mp-simha-fix-roads-dug-for-piped-gas-project-asks-nagendra/articleshow/89190459.cms||---

The high Court clubbed together about 230-odd petitions, filed by women self-help groups challenging the government decision to centralize the distribution of ready to eat food and heard the case. The HC granted an interim stay on the government decision and fixed the next date of hearing from March three—enabling the WSHGs to continue their work for the time being. Through their petitions, women self-help groups had submitted in the court that the state government decision would render nearly 20,000 women jobless in the state. They contended that women self-help groups were engaged in the successful distribution of ready to eat food to anganwadis and pregnant women, without any complaints. The state cabinet, at its meeting in November last year, had decided to centralize the distribution of ready to eat food through the state seed and agriculture development corporation. Stung by criticism, state women and child development department maintained that a centralized system would help proper monitoring to maintain quality of ready to eat food. Welcoming the High Court interim stay, BJP vice-president and former chief minister Raman Singh said “It’s a blow to the insensitive state government, which was trying to snatch away jobs of more than 20,000 women”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/hc-stays-govt-order-to-centralise-ready-to-eat-food-distribution/articleshow/89190475.cms||---

The chief minister said Amul has been paying decent price to dairy farmers with no scope for cheating, adulteration and middlemen and added that they have been giving profits as bonus for every six months. He said some vested interests have destroyed cooperative dairies. He said he had witnessed the problems of dairy farmers during padayatra where they compared their milk rates to that of mineral water, saying while the price of one-litre mineral water was 23, they don’t even get that for a litre of milk and added that the state government has been taking measures to overcome such scenario. The chief minister said other dairies have been paying 5 to 20 per litre more than the existing price as that Amul has been paying remunerative price in the market. He said the government has been setting up BMCs and AMCs at locations where milk is being procured and added that they will be set up in every village with expansion of Amul project. He said receipt will be given to dairy farmers with details of price and quantity immediately after milk is purchased and added that quality can be tested directly.

---||Vijayawada||Farmers’ counsels urge HC to continue hearing capital pleas||Vijayawada: The counsels for capital region farmers on Friday urged the high court to continue its hearing on the petitions as the state government has said it will reintroduce the bills for trifurcation of the capital. The intent of the government is to evade court hearing as it has declared that it will bring the same laws again, which is nothing but playing hide and seek with the judiciary, argued the counsels for the petitioners. The high court bench headed by Chief Justice Prashant Kumar Mishra, Justice M Satynarayana Murthy and Justice D V S S Somayajulu, which heard the batch of petitions filed challenging the twin legislations intended for trifurcation of the capital, had earlier asked the petitioners to submit written arguments as to how the petitions still sustain after the twin legislations have been repealed.Senior counsel Unnam Muralidhar Rao said the government, in the statement of objects and reasons given while repealing the twin legislations had said it has not followed due procedure while enacting laws for trifurcation of the capital. At the same time, it also stated that the bills would be reintroduced. As the petitions challenge the legislative competence of the state government to make such laws, they still survive before the courts, he said.Senior counsel Jandhyala Ravi Shankar argued that the government violated constitutional and human rights of farmers by making the twin legislations for trifurcation. The farmers incurred huge losses with their property values degraded because of the government’s actions, and it should not be allowed to do the same injustice again, he said.Advocates P A K Kishore and K S Murthy argued that the government has the power to change the boundaries of districts only, but it cannot alter the capital. As Amaravati was decided as capital as a consequence of the Reorganisation Act, the government has no power to change the capital, they said. Ambati Sudhakar Rao said as the trifurcation legislations have been repealed, the government should implement the original master plan and complete all pending works.The bench, while observing that courts cannot prevent the legislature from making laws, said courts can only interfere when a law is made in violation of the Constitution before posting the matter to February 2.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/farmers-counsels-urge-hc-to-continue-hearing-capital-pleas/articleshow/89190480.cms||---

---||Jaipur||CM Ashok Gehlot seeks suggestions from 70 industry bodies for Rajasthan budget||JAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot along with ministers and senior officials of most government departments sought suggestions and recommendations from representatives of close to 70 industry bodies for the upcoming 2022-23 state budget to be presented in February for which the date is yet to be decided. In the tax advisory committee meeting, which was held virtually, industry representatives highlighted the systemic issues, high taxes and costly power among others. CII-Rajasthan in its representation said that as per MSME Act 2006, large scale units, public sector undertakings and government departments need to pay to MSMEs within 45 days of purchasing. Chairman of the industry body chairman Sanjay Saboo said, “Payments are piling up and industry needs this support at this critical time and all government and large scale units should strictly follow the MSME Act for payment within 45 days.” He said there was a notification issued by finance department in June, 2020 giving directions to government departments to pay the pending payments in next 15 days and to report to FD by 6 July. “Still most of the payments are stuck with PWD, JVVNL, AVVNL, JdVVNL, RSRDC, RSWC, Rajasthan Medical Corp Ltd, and medical department, etc,” Saboo added. FICCI in its recommendations said that high cross subsidy surcharge of Rs 1.94 a unit prevents industries to avail open access increasing their cost of operation. “Despite clear rationalisation in tariffs of HT consumers, as done by the RERC, the benefit doesn’t reflect in the value of CSS which is consistently increasing,” N K Jain of FICCI-Rajasthan, and Employers Association of Rajasthan, said. Jain said high additional surcharge of Rs 0.97 and its continued applicability despite open access being almost negligible in the state merits considering critical parameters while computing ASC such as fixed or demand charges paid by the consume. Similarly, Suresh Agarwal of Federation of Rajasthan Trade and Industry, said that the pre-proposed traders welfare board should be formed, in which maximum number of traders should be made members. The position of board chairmanship should also be handed over to a businessman. Besides, Agarwal said warehouses should be given the status of industries. “The provision of collection of urban development tax by the Municipal Corporation in RIICO industrial areas should be abolished permanently while the NOC for fire should be practical and easy, added Agarwal. Federation of Rajasthan Exporters (FORE) president Rajiv Arora said the government needs to form the export promotion council early and provide subsidies to smaller industrial units for participating fairs and exhibition like UP and Haryana. He said other state governments are giving incentives to exporters for freight charges and a similar relief mechanism can be made in the state. Assocham chairman of Rajasthan Ajay Data said startups should get Rs 1,000 crore fund and urged the government to declare Rajasthan as mustard state and remove stock limit on its seed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/gehlot-seeks-suggestions-from-70-industry-bodies-for-state-budget/articleshow/89190502.cms||---

He said effective monitoring should be ensured from police stations to outpost levels in the districts and pro-active policing should make the state a leader in crime control. Gehlot was addressing the meeting of IGs and SPs through video conference from the chief minister's residence for the second day on Friday. He said it was a matter of satisfaction that due to various innovations, there has been a significant reduction in the average time taken in disposal of cases of POCSO Act, women atrocities and SC-ST harassments. Police should ensure effective action in such cases in future too. Chief minister directed that SPs should adopt innovations for effective prevention of cyber and economic crimes. The crime branch should make quality supervision of crimes and in serious crimes, higher officials themselves should ensure proper investigation by visiting the spot. He told senior police officers to take priority and seriousness of incidents of death in police custody, rape, crime against children, atrocities on women etc. In such cases, immediately inform the media about the actual situation, so that the law and order situation is not disturbed. There should be effective coordination between police headquarters and the social media teams of districts. Gehlot said that even today, incidents like untouchability and removal of grooms from the mare during a baraat are a blot on humanity. Police should make special efforts to prevent these incidents. In serious incidents, provide immediate assistance to the victim in compensation scheme as per the rules, he said. The chief minister, appreciated the arrest of the gang through pro-active policing in Pratapgarh district, while taking further action on the basis of the video of rape found in the mobile of the accused involved in the incidents of vehicle theft and said that such efforts should be made in all the districts. The chief minister said police personnel carry out their duties in difficult and challenging circumstances. In such a situation, their morale increases by getting promotion and other service benefits on time. The SPs should ensure that promotion of police personnel is done on time. Also, take disciplinary action against negligent and corrupt employees, he said. Minister of state for home Rajendra Singh Yadav said an effective plan should be prepared at the police headquarters level to check criminals by identifying the areas where incidents of dacoity and robbery are more. He said the best practices should be adopted by studying the techniques and innovations being used for the prevention of cyber and other crimes in different countries.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/sps-have-key-role-in-strengthening-law-and-order-at-grassroots-level/articleshow/89190506.cms||---

---||Surat||Former Himachal Pradesh woman cricketer held for fraud in Surat||SURAT: The lure of getting to play in the Ranji Trophy, country’s premium longer format league, proved costly for a city-based cricketer who was duped of Rs 27 lakh by a multi-state gang. At the centre of the racket is former woman cricketer from Himachal Pradesh, Sapna Kumari Randhawa (32). She was arrested on Wednesday by the economic offence cell of city police following a complaint filed by 29-year-old Bhavik Patel, a resident of Navsari. Apart from a former cricketer, the complaint also mentions the name of an official of a state association making the racket murkier. Patel’s complaint states that Randhawa extracted Rs 14.50 lakh from him while her aid Vishal pocketed Rs 12.50 lakh. Though Patel never played in Ranji Trophy, Vishal managed to get him in Nagaland’s T20 team. Patel played his only match against Jharkhand in the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy in February 2019. Patel who hails from Navsari, shifted his base to Surat in 2017, and started coaching at the Lalbhai Cricket Academy. In 2018 he was a part of a Surat team that participated in a tournament organized at Hathras in Uttar Pradesh. Ram Chauhan, one of the organizers of the event, told Patel that if he is ready to spend money he can play in the Ranji Trophy. After Patel showed interest, Chauhan arranged a meeting with Randhawa in Jalandhar in 2018. Randhawa told Patel that to play Ranji matches he will have to make fake documents of different state associations. The deal was struck. Patel was offered six matches in a year across all the three formats in return of Rs 22 lakh. Randhawa demanded Rs 5 lakh within a week and Patel paid Rs 10,000 as advance. A few days later, Patel along with Chauhan went to Kangra in Himachal Pradesh where they met Randhawa and her brother Ravindra Singh. He paid cash Rs 3 lakh to start the procedure to make fake documents. After returning to Surat, he deposited Rs one lakh each in a bank account of one Sushilaben and Jinu Tanwar. After a few days Randhawa asked for Rs 2 lakh for her brother-in-law’s treatment which Patel deposited in her bank account. After paying a total of Rs 12.50 lakh Patel did not get a chance to play a single match. Later, Randhawa ensured him a place in the Assam team. As instructed, Patel went to Guwahati and met one Dhanwant Tiwari who gave him some fake documents and also asked him to fill up a BCCI form. But he never received a call up from the selectors. In February 2019 Randhawa asked Patel to go to Nagaland and meet one Vishal. Patel went to the office of Nagaland State Cricket Association. After giving the reference of Vishal, joint secretary of the association, Ahidur Rahman, filled up his form and allowed him to join the state team camp, the complaint states. Vishal took Rs 12.50 lakhs from Patel for this favour and later he made his T20 debut against Jharkhand. Patel also played in the Nagaland Premier League. But the Ranji Trophy promise never materialized. After several failed attempts to get his money back, Patel filed a complaint with Surat police on January 20, 2022. Police registered an offence under IPC section 420 (cheating and dishonestly) and arrested Randhawa.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/surat/former-hp-woman-cricketer-held-for-fraud/articleshow/89190514.cms||---

It has demanded permission for the sale of rough diamonds in Special Notified Zone (SNZ) in Mumbai besides allowing exporters to import 10% of the total CPD’s exported at nil duty. “India is the 5th largest exporter of gems and jewellery, contributing 5.8% of the global exports of US$ 629.06 billion. India is emerging as a potential global leader in jewellery exports due to the sheer talent pool and expertise the country has developed over decades of hard work,” said GJEPC chairman Colin Shah.“Post pandemic, it has been a new beginning for the industry and we will achieve the target of US$ 41 billion as set for this sector by Prime Minister as part of the overall target of merchandise exports of US$ 400 billion. We now target to achieve US$ 100 billion exports when India will observe the centenary of its independence,” Shah added. “To achieve this goal we have made several suggestions to the union government. This will not only help the Indian diamond industry to remain as the largest diamond producer of diamonds in the world but would also help us to become the largest diamond trading hub,” he said. According to GJEPC, if the sale is permitted from SNZ, at least 20% of the rough diamond trading will be shifted there and the government will be able to collect an additional tax of US$ 3.48 million. Currently, only viewing of rough diamonds is permitted in SNZ and no sale is allowed. GJEPC has also demanded the reduction in import duty on precious metals like gold, silver, platinum from 7.5% to 4%.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/surat/slash-duty-on-gold-cut-polished-diamonds/articleshow/89190518.cms||---

He insisted that all government schemes should be taken to the doorsteps of people.“In the next 18 months, people’s representatives and officials need to work in coordination, to effectively implement government schemes aimed at the welfare of people. All government work should be completed within the prescribed time-frame. The government will not tolerate it if files are found piling up in offices without clearances.

He later visited the Dakshina Kannada BJP office. Speaking after being felicitated by party workers at the district BJP office, he called upon the BJP workers to work towards the victory of the BJP candidates, in all the eight assembly constituencies in Dakshina Kannada, in the next assembly election. “We need to get ready for the elections to be held for zilla panchayat and taluk panchayat elections. There is a need to strengthen the party at the grassroots level in the district. The party workers should create awareness on the welfare schemes of the government, among the people. An action plan for permanent development works in Dakshina Kannada will be chalked out after consulting the MLAs in the district,” he said. He added, “Ours is a pro-Hindu and pro-Hindutva government. The government has already passed the Prevention of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Act, and also announced its decision on providing autonomy to temples. Congress leaders are in an illusion, and there is a feeling of insecurity among them. They are trying to politicise the issue of the Sri Narayana Guru tableau and Mekedatu project. Karnataka will be able to present the Sri Narayana Guru tableau in next year’s Republic Day celebrations, if the central government announces a spiritual theme.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/strengthen-bjp-at-grassroots-level-min-tells-party-workers/articleshow/89190524.cms||---
---||Delhi||Centre: LG appointed SPP in national interest||New Delhi: The Centre has told Delhi High Court that the lieutenant governor appointed special public prosecutors (SPP) for last year’s Republic Day violence and 2020 riots cases in the interest of efficient, fair and just trial as the two sets of cases are of “grave national concern”. In a response to the petition by the Delhi government, challenging the appointment of Delhi Police’s chosen lawyers as SPPs by the LG, the Centre said since both the cases arose directly from laws of the Parliament i.e. the citizenship amendment and farm laws, the LG, being a delegate of the President, had the “responsibility to have a more active role in those matters.” Both the cases are of “highly sensitive nature” and relate to “public order”, which is excluded from the purview of the Delhi government, it added. “The unfortunate incidents of violence did lead to disturbance of public order and a loss of life and property (in northeast Delhi riots case) and the then continuing farmers’ agitation and unfortunate incident of violence have prompted a need for efficient, fair and just prosecution (of cases) to retain the faith in the country’s law and order machinery,” said the affidavit filed by the special secretary to LG. “The ‘public order’ expressly involves cognizance of offences, search, seizure and arrest, followed by registration of FIRs, investigation, prosecution and trial. The wide amplitude provided to the meaning of this term includes the appointment of special prosecutors for an efficient and just prosecution of the cases so registered,” it added. In its petition, Delhi government said that the LG order appointing Delhi Police’s chosen lawyers as SPPs, results in a serious conflict of interest.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/centre-lg-appointed-spp-in-national-interest/articleshow/89188740.cms||TNN

Naik has urged parents to ensure that their children, who have completed the mandatory gap of four weeks, take the second dose. She said they have not received a good response for vaccinations in the children’s category, and that parents should see that their eligible children are inoculated at the earliest. She also appealed to people who have not taken their first dose to get vaccinated. Many people who have lost their lives due to Covid were not vaccinated. “Vaccination will save lives,” she said. People should not fall prey to fake messages being circulated on social media, she added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/second-vaccine-dose-for-15-18-age-group-from-tomorrow/articleshow/89210664.cms||---

Officials said Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) had lifted restrictions from various activities in its Thursday order and also increased the staff strength at government offices. “In view of the above, the suspension of activities related to driving licence skill tests and learning licence test are, hereby, withdrawn with immediate effect. All zonal authorities shall take necessary steps and actions to resume the activities,” the order stated. Officials said zonal deputy commissioners and transport officers had been directed to ensure that all Covid-19 protocol and appropriate behaviour such as sanitisation of hands, social distancing and wearing of masks as per the DDMA guidelines were followed while conducting the tests. The department had suspended all fresh online appointments and tests on January 5 when the Covid-19 cases started showing an upward trend. Officials said the appointments that were cancelled would now be rescheduled and SMSs would be sent to the applicants. All faceless services during this period continued at all zonal offices. However, during the past three weeks, the transport department continued with fitness tests for commercial vehicles. “Fitness is important for plying of goods vehicles and public transport to provide essential services.

---||Goa||Goa election 2022: In Mayem, Pravin Zantye has a point to prove as BJP aims four-in-a-row||BJP has won the Mayem assembly seat for the last three terms and in an attempt to retain the bastion, dropped its sitting MLA Pravin Zantye. BJP won both zilla parishad seats of Mayem and Karapur-Sarvan last year, but the party did not appear to have much confidence in Zantye. Instead, they put their faith in Premendra Shet, who had lost the Mayem ZP election by 126 votes. In fact, Shet first joined MGP, but with BJP keen to have him on their side, switched allegiance. Shet is the brother of former Mayem MLA and speaker Anant. Besides Zantye (now MGP) and Shet, the Mayem battlefield will witness a five-cornered fight with Rajesh Kalangutkar (AAP), Santosh Kumar Sawant (Goa Forward) and Shrikrishna Parab of Revolutionary Goans Party in the fray. The contesting candidates have their own strengths, and weakness. While Zantye is the former MLA and has a big point to prove, Shet and Kalangutkar contested the zilla parishad elections, without success. Shet finished second behind BJP’s Shankar Chodankar in the zilla polls, while Kalangutkar was third, eventually settling for an AAP ticket and kickstarting his campaign ahead of the rest. Kalangutkar’s close aides, though, are learned to be unhappy with his decision to contest on AAP banner. GFP’s Sawant contested the last assembly election on Congress ticket and finished second behind Zantye. The unrest within the Congress Mayem block doesn’t help his cause. Zantye, the former MLA, has been active in Mayem politics for over a decade. After being denied a ticket, he quit BJP and joined MGP which has considerable influence in the constituency. Zantye has his own vote bank, due to his long career in politics and family history with father Harish being a three-time MLA, cabinet minister and North Goa member of parliament. “BJP had no choice but drop Zantye because there was strong anti-incumbency against him,” said one party source. “The Mayem mandal also complained that he is not accessible to the public.” Parab, debuting with Revolutionary Goans, has been able to attract youth in the constituency as it promises to bring a change in Goan politics. Political observers say since there are too many candidates in Mayem, BJP may enjoy a slight edge with its strong organisation in the constituency. Development has been in short supply in Mayem, which has not had any representation in the cabinet since 2002, despite the presence of MLAs from the ruling party. Mayem is one of the constituencies in the mining belt, and closure of the activity is now a talking point. The evacuee property, lack of tourism infrastructure, public transport and market complex are some of the other issues here. It will be interesting to see how those who were dependent on mining vote in Mayem as the activity has come to a halt since March, 2018. BJP has gambled in Mayem, dropping its MLA. Having won it three times in a row, they should know what they are doing. But with new kids on the block, this should be an interesting battle to watch.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/in-mayem-zantye-has-a-point-toprove-as-bjp-aims-four-in-a-row/articleshow/89210579.cms||Murari Shetye

The followers of Sri Narayana Guru are not just in Karnataka or Kerala, but across the globe. They were pained by the insult to the visionary guru. B Janardhana Poojari led the main procession, as he has followed Sri Narayan Guru’s values and teaching in his political career.

The issue holds significance as environmentalists are up in arms with the civic body against the chopping of a 200-year-old banyan tree along with 400 other trees for the project.State urban development minister Eknath Shinde and NMC commissioner Kailas Jadhav also accompanied the environment minister. “It has to be examined whether there is a need for a flyover. If there is a need then also the Banyan tree should not be cut. The NMC will also have to see to it that there is minimum impact on other trees due to the flyover project,” Thackeray said.He also asked the people to come forward to tackle the issue of pollution in Godavari river and its tributaries. “Just like people want the Banyan and other trees to be saved, they must also be proactive in making the river free of pollution,” he said, adding that Nandini river will be cleaned with people’s participation.Earlier in the day, Thackeray had travelled to Trimbakeshwar taluka and inspected the iron bridge connecting Savarpada and Sendripada. He had taken note of the problem faced by tribals in crossing a makeshift structure made of bamboo to bring water and ordered the construction of the iron bridge.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/environment-and-development-should-go-hand-in-hand-aaditya/articleshow/89190527.cms||---

With the new flyover, motorists are now more than happy to drive past the major crssings in barely a couple of minutes.While the elevated corridor on the Mumbai Agra highway from Indiranagar to Dwarka to Meenatai Thackeray Stadium was complete in 2013 and thrown open to vehicular traffic, the chaotic traffic on the highway stretch for over 2km after the flyover descended near Meenatai Thackeray stadium had been a concern. Apart from the traffic snarls at Amrutdham Chowk, Rasbihari Junction, Bidi Kamgar Junction and Jatra hotel junction, a large number of people had died in road accidents along the stretch. To tide over the crises, construction of the flyover from opposite K K Wagh College to Jatra Hotel started in 2018. The new flyover was completed in August 2021 and connected to the Dwarka flyover. A senior National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) official said, “The string of elevated corridors, underpasses along on the Mumbai Agra highway passing through the city from Garware Point and now the new flyover connecting the Dwarka flyover, the overall length of elevated corridors in the city is approximately 17km. The time taken to cross this entire length is only 12 minutes.”Road users say this is not only helping people travelling on the highway from Mumbai to Malegaon, Dhule or Indore, but also those coming from the opposite direction. Srikant Patil, a professor by profession, said, “Travelling from Nashik to Malegaon, a distance of about 100km, would take about 2.15 hours earlier. With the new flyover becoming operational, the travel time has been cut by at least 45 minutes. Also because of the FasTag system, the waiting time at the toll plazas, which used to be roughly 15-20 minutes, is now negligible.” Nashikites eligible for a discount in the toll fees at the Pimpalgaon plaza said they had to register their names and vehicles at the facility to be eligible for the concession and renew it on a yearly basis. “With a little change in the software at the end of the toll plaza, vehicles with the registration number starting with MH-15 can be allowed to pass through the toll plaza with the discount,” a resident said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/flyover-connecting-dwarka-a-boon-for-nashik-motorists/articleshow/89190534.cms||---

Dr Kailas Bhoye, vaccination coordinating officer for the district, said that each of the vaccination vans was given a target of giving 200 doses for which, a medical officer and vaccines were provided, while the NGOs provided their vehicle, driver, vaccinator and even data entry operator.“Of the 200 target, on an average, 185 doses were administered per day, which is remarkable,” said Dr Bhoye.The Swades Foundation had already given six vehicles that were carrying out vaccination in four talukas and from February 1, it will add five more vehicles in five non-tribal blocks.Apart from this, there is Jeevika Foundation that is also aiding the vaccination programme through six vehicles in six talukas (blocks), the officer said. Henceforth, there will be 17 vaccine vans for inoculating beneficiaries.The Swades Foundation vans will now enable the vaccination in Malegaon, Balgan, Yeola, Nandgaon, Niphad, besides Trimbakeshwar, Igatpuri, Peth and Surgana talukas.Jeevika has provided vans for vaccination in Nashik city, Niphad, Sinnar, Yeola, Malegaon and Baglan talukas.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/over-20000-vaccinated-through-mobile-vans/articleshow/89190540.cms||---
---||Hubballi||Positivity rate in Dharwad soars, but safety norms get short shrift||Hubballi: The Covid-positive rate in Dharwad has crossed 23 per cent but authorities have failed to enforce safety norms such as mask wearing in public places, including government offices, strictly. In most government offices housed in the smaller Vidhana Soudha and the Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation (HDMC), staff are not adhering to Covid guidelines. Taking advantage of this, people are also violating the Covid guidelines fearlessly, some residents feel. Satish Kumar, a visitor to the smaller Vidhana Soudha, said: “I am surprised to see that the government officials and staff are not even bothered to follow Covid guidelines and wear masks. At the nearby sub-registrar's office, the crowd is large but no distancing norms or mask wearing is followed.” With the intention of creating awareness among people about Covid guidelines, the authorities have slapped fines on the public in market places, on major roads and other places. But some residents have pointed out the one-sided action by the authorities. Dr M C Sindhur, a doctor and social activist, said that the rules seemed to have been framed only for the public, “not for them (officials)”. “For negligence, both have to pay more fines in the near future if the situation turns for the worse,” he said. Nitesh Patil, the deputy commissioner of Dharwad, said the rules are the same for everyone and applicable to all equally. “There is no discrimination between public and government officials. There are many examples of slapping fines at government offices during the first wave, but due to lack of fear, people are reluctant to wear masks and follow Covid rules. Instructions have been issued to all offices to follow Covid guidelines. They have to adhere to it,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/positivity-rate-in-dharwad-soars-but-safety-norms-get-short-shrift/articleshow/89190541.cms||J Abbas Mulla
---||Hubballi||Double blow for hospitality sector as Covid, polls in North India keep labourers away||Hubballi: Adding to the many problems that an already beleaguered hospitality sector in Hubballi-Dharwad is grappling with is the shortage in manpower that many establishments are facing. Migrant labourers from North Indian states constitute the bulk of the labour force in most of the eateries and hotels, and with elections scheduled in many of these states over the next two months, many employees have returned home to cast their vote. Unfortunately, this has only added to their woes since many employees who had gone home for Dasara and Deepavali have not returned to the twin cities, citing the spike in Covid-19 cases.Ramanand Sooda, officebearer of the Hubballi Hotel Association, said that there were around 15 people from Uttar Pradesh in his employ. “But none of them has returned to work after leaving for a festival. With the government curtailing our operations, we are also reluctant to ask them to return, and they are also disinclined to return. The state government has mandated that all employees in the hospitality industry be fully vaccinated, whereas many of our North Indian employees are yet to receive the second dose. The assembly elections in their home states has given them another reason to stay back. Most labourers from Uttar Pradesh arrive in groups, but most hotels are in no position to hire employees in large numbers. But we do hope that our employees return once the elections are over. Labourers from Uttar Pradesh and other North Indian states are very skilled in preparing Chinese food, in addition to delicacies of their home states,” Sooda said.Echoing Sooda’s observations, chief executive officer of The Hans Hotel Ajay Handa said, “Lucknow and Gorakhpur cities are hubs for chefs. Although election is one reason for their staying back, the predominant reason is the fear of Covid, now that the third wave is here. It has also been difficult for us to retain employees in the face of restrictions, while families are asking the labourers not to leave home.”Amarjeet, a chef at a star hotel on Gokul Road in Hubballi, is among those who has decided to stay back in his home in North India. Amarjeet said that he, along with many of his friends, had planned on returning to Karnataka in December. “But with the government imposing curbs on New Year celebrations, we decided to wait till Sankranthi, when the election calendar was announced. Many of us have secured part-time employment, and if the Election Commission lifts curbs by January 30, we may start earning well,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/double-blow-for-hospitality-sector-as-covid-polls-in-north-india-keep-labourers-away/articleshow/89190542.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

There are several instances wherein Chetti has wilfully refused to protect and follow the university acts/ statutes and UGC KCSR rules.” ATW believes Chetti's continuation as the VC is highly detrimental to not only the staff, but also to the UAS’ future, he said, and sought the government to ask Chetti to step down or go on leave for the remaining period. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/uas-vc-not-attending-to-issues-affecting-teachers/articleshow/89190543.cms||---

The post of mayor is reserved for a Scheduled Caste, and deputy mayor’s post is reserved for the general category. Chairmen for various standing committees will be appointed on the same day. Right now, there are 27 Congress corporators, 24 BJP corporators and 4 JD(S) corporators, of a total 55 wards. Including two MPs, three MLAs and three MLCs, the total number of members in the corporation is 63, and a simple majority of 32 votes is needed to win the election. The BJP has now included 5 more MLCs in the Kalaburagi City Corporation voters list, due to which the total number will increase to 68, and a simple majority of 35 votes is required to get a simple majority, and the BJP has this number. Including an MP, 2 MLAs, 3 MLCs and 24 corporators, the BJP had 30 votes. However, after including five more names like Laxman Savadi, Tulasi Gowda, Lehar Singh, Bharathi Shetty and Raghunathrao Malkapure, five new names have been included, due to which the BJP has increased its strength to 35. Congress members have opposed this, and have submitted a complaint letter to the regional commissioner. Meanwhile, resentment has been growing in Hubballi-Dharwad, where the corporators elected in September are yet to be officially sworn in, and the mayoral elections yet to be held. The Congress has been asking the state government to expedite the process.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/kburagi-mayoral-polls-will-be-held-on-feb-5/articleshow/89190545.cms||---

He started screening his film in schools and colleges from October 2 last year and his initiative will continue till August 15. Aralikatti told TOI that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had appealed youngsters in his ‘Mann ki baath’, on March 28, 2021, to introduce freedom fighters of their area to mark Azadi Ka Amrut Mahotsav. “Modi’s appeal motivated me to think about freedom fighters of our district. I started to study about freedom fighters of Haveri district and got to know that they were in contact with national leaders like Gandhi, Subhash Chandra Bose and others,” he said. “Mailara Mahadeva was the only one from Karnataka among 75 freedom fighters chosen by Gandhi to take part in the Dandi March in 1930. When Bose attracted youngsters for his Forward Block party, Hosamani Siddappa of Haveri was the first president and KF Patil from Ranebennur was the first secretary for its Karnataka unit. Because of their efforts, Bose visited Byadagi on July 13, 1939,” he said. “Haveri has contributed over 500 freedom fighters. Sangur Kariyappa was the leader for Hirekerur, Mailara Mahadeva was for Hosaritti, Gudleppa Hallikeri and Hosamani Siddappa were from Haveri. Many of them were rich and sacrificed their prosperity for the freedom struggle. Revanappa Mannangi, who was renamed as Ramanand by Gandhi at Vardha Ashram in Maharashtra was married to Veeramma, a Dalit girl, as suggested by Gandhi himself.” he added. Aralikatti said he approached the district administration and some organisations for funds for the documentary but did not get due to technical reasons. “I spent Rs 2.5 lakh for the-30-minute documentary which has details of about freedom 300 fighters. We could get video bytes of freedom fighter Nagesh Kulkarni, who passed away recently, and from Mallappa Koppad, who is still active in Hire Anaji village. The district administration has permitted me to screen the documentary and we have already screened it at 35 schools and colleges. We are also getting invitations from mutts-temples, banks and other organisations,” he said. Mallappa Koppad said, “I am happy that our next generation is showing respect to us. It’s a need in today’s era.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/documentary-showcases-heroic-freedom-fighters-of-haveri/articleshow/89190547.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

Belagavi South and North MLAs, Abhay Patil and Anil Benake, Nippani MLA Shashikala Jolle and her spouse, Chikkodi MP Annasaheb Jolle, Kittur MLA Doddagoudar Mahantesh Basavantaray, MLC Laxman Savadi, Ramadurga MLA Shivalingappa Yadawad and others met chief minister Basavaraj Bommai, said sources. MLA Patil said the purpose of the visit was to wish the chief mnister on his birthday and there was no political angle to the development. It all began with party’ humiliating debacle in the MLC poll in Belagavi-Chikkodi. The youngest among the brothers, Lakhan Jarkiholi’s independent contest came as a huge blow to the BJP candidate Mahantesh Kavatagimath. Gokak MLA Ramesh and Arabhavi MLA Balchandra projected Lakhan’s candidature as a tool to defeat the Congress with. But this failed to translate on the ground.After the results, defeated candidate Kavatagimath informally registered his complaint against the brother with the top brass in the party, while other MLA silently expressed their reservations. However, on Saturday, January 22 the dissent came to the fore with leaders openly sidelining the brothers. For a meeting Kavatagimath called at the residence of Umesh Katti, the brothers were uninvited. Moreover, the sources say that they even discussed how Lakhan’s candidature led to the party’s defeat.Katti, talking to ToI about the meeting, acknowledged about deliberations on the loss without naming anyone. “I do not want to name anyone. But about 10 MLAs discussed the reasons for the debacle. We have also asked Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai to take stringent action against those responsible for the defeat,” he said. On asking why they were not invited, he said “in an informal talk among MLAs we decided to sit together one day and no one was formally invited.”Ramesh, responding to the developments, said: “Umesh Katti, who was inactive for a long time, has suddenly become active and he has no issues. Let him do what he wants to do.” Sources in the party said that Ramesh has started to lobby for a cabinet berth using his brother Lakhan as a trump-card. In the council, the BJP is short of majority and is in need for support from outside. Since the party wants to pass a crucial anti-conversion bill, having majority is important. Using this, Ramesh is said to be bargaining for the position and hence his opponents in the district are cornering him to send out a strong message to the top rung in the party. Lakhan said the BJP has to take him back to the cabinet as he would help the party win next assembly elections.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/jarkiholi-brothers-uninvited-to-bjp-huddle-buzz-on-sidelining-grows/articleshow/89190550.cms||Shreyas HS

AAP has also said that RTI documents reveal that there has been a five-fold increase in water bills. AAP has produced multiple water bills showing how errors in unit readings and other billing errors have seen bills inflated. Even those who did not consume any water were issued bills. AAP’s chief ministerial candidate Amit Palekar said that the government is earning Rs 4 crore per month, which translates to Rs 48 crore per year due to the erroneous bills. “The amount is not small; this is a multi-crore scam. This indicates a systematic scam is being perpetrated by the chief minister and his ministers,” said Palekar. He said that the fiasco around the free water scheme also proves chief minister Pramod Sawant’s incompetence. Valmiki Naik, AAP’s Panaji candidate, said that the party filed multiple RTI requests on the inflated water bills and the response revealed that many people in the state are receiving a five-fold increase in charges. “The consumers who should have received no bills had to pay Rs 200 , and those who should have received Rs 200 bills were given Rs 1,000 bills,” said Naik. While addressing the media, Palekar said, “In our possession are the water bills of Kalapur and St Inez residents and the RTI response has revealed how incompetent the chief minister and his PWD department are. There are errors in the units’ readings and the people have been receiving inflated water bills.” Palekar had challenged Sawant to a debate on inflated water bills but the chief minister never responded.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/goa/news/bjps-free-water-scheme-is-a-multi-crore-scam-consumers-given-inflated-bills-aap/articleshow/89215947.cms||---

Already discussions with the leading agencies pertaining to digital transactions were held and working on the execution of the QR based cash transactions in all the HDBRTS bus stops. After the pandemic hit the nation, commuters have been demanding for cashless and digital transactions. As a result, the authorities are now working on the implementation of a digital payment system. Ganesh Rathod, deputy general manager, HDBRTS, said that earlier we thought of promoting cashless, contact less transactions to which people are now very used to, now we are planning to bring QR code based transactions in addition to the current system of contact less transactions. "In a couple of weeks the QR code based cash transaction system will be introduced in all the bus stops of HDBRTS to minimise cash-based transactions and encourage people to pay through e-wallets, like Google Pay or PhonePe. QR codes will be put up inside the bus through which people can pay.", he added.Ashwini, a bank employee of Keshwapur said, we claim that the HDBRTS has advanced features and service, but it's unfortunate that at the ticket counters there is still no digital payment system. "Recently I faced difficulty getting a ticket for Dharwad from Hubballi railway station, due to lack of adequate change to buy a ticket. Later I asked for the digital system, the staff sitting at the counter said that they don't have a digital payment system", he added. A staff at the ticket counter of HDBRTS, said that they often struggled to change large notes. If the QR based cash transactions implemented at the bus stops, it would be easier for the public to get ticket, he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/hdbrts-to-soon-start-qr-based-ticketing-system/articleshow/89190551.cms||---

Since the majority of these nine committees have a say on the financial matters too, these play a vital role in the decision making.Usually, the mayor recommends the names of the members of the committees to the governor Punjab and administrator Chandigarh and the recommended names get the nod. In the past, the members were constituted from ruling and opposition political parties.“Since many sub-committees of the municipal corporation (MC) have a say on the financial aspects, on top of passing the agenda items, they play a vital role to initiate developmental works. Works that are comparatively small are being passed by these committees and subsequently monitored by them too. It reduces the work pressure on the general house — the biggest decision making platform — and also on the F&CC,” said sources.The fire committee, art and culture committee, village and slum development committee, city beautification committee and ani mandi committee are some of the key sub-committees. These committees have also the power to call special invitees for advice. The members of these committees are expected to meet once a month compulsorily to discuss the agendas.It has also been seen in the past that some time MC gets the nod for the committees late, but sources revealed that this time it is expected that the committees may be approved soon — by February or March.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/mc-forms-fcc-3-sub-panels-9-to-be-sent-to-guv-for-approval/articleshow/89190572.cms||---

---||Rajkot||Gujarat: Three cochlear transplants performed at GG Hospital||RAJKOT: Jamnagar’s state-run GG Hospital became the first from Saurashtra region to carry out the cochlear implant surgery. Children whose hearing is impaired by birth need the cochlear implant. The hospital has also started the post-implant speech therapy for the three children who underwent cochlear transplant operation on Monday. The cochlear transplant costs around Rs 8-10 lakh making it too costly for underprivileged families. With the state-run GG Hospital implanting the artificial organ for free, all such families no longer have to bother about the expensive treatment. On Monday, a team of experts from Gandhinagar were roped in to perform the implant operations on three children — Jinal Andani, Ved Rabadiya and Dhruval Bavarva. GG Hospital’s ENT department head Dr Niral Modi got the training for the surgery from Dr Niraj Suri, nodal state officer of cochlear implant. Dr B R Vyas, professor of paediatric department of MP Shah Medical College, Jamnagar, said: “On an average 0.7% children face hearing deficiency. In this surgery the ENT specialist removes the defective cochlear and implants a new one which delivers sound signals to the hearing nerves.” The children who have hearing deficiency also don’t learn to speak. So, the implant is followed by speech therapy for 12 to 18 months. Earlier, patients had to travel to Ahmedabad as no state-run hospitals in Saurashtra region were equipped to carry out the transplant. Doctors informed that some children are born with hearing impairment while some lose hearing capacity due to severe illness like jaundice, epilepsy or damage to the brain. The cochlear implant gives a new lease of life to these children.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/three-cochlear-transplants-performed-at-gg-hospital/articleshow/89190576.cms||---

The party also dared BJP to back up the allegations made in 2012, accusing Congress of facilitating a Rs 35,000 crore loss to the state exchequer through illegal mining. If BJP cannot make the PAC report public, then chief minister Pramod Sawant and the BJP president should apologise to the state and Congress for spreading lies, said state Congress president Girish Chodankar. The PAC report was used by former chief minister Manohar Parrikar to accuse Congress of corruption and formed a key part of the BJP campaign to defeat Congress in 2012. “After making allegations against Congress, BJP defeated Congress and has been in the government for 10 years. It is their responsibility to investigate the allegations made by them and recover the money,” Chodankar said. He said that after Congress forms the government, every single allegation made against BJP will be investigated and action will be taken. “When I make allegations it becomes my responsibility to investigate it when my party forms the government. Otherwise, it will be proved that I was making allegations to derive political gains,”he said. He also dared BJP, AAP and TMC to make their stand on the three linear projects and coal transportation clear. “People of Goa are not demanding freebies, but they want a guarantee whether Goa will be made coal-free and the three linear projects will be rejected. These parties are not speaking on these issues,” Chodankar said.

Railways had completed the survey work on the 76okm route from Varanasi to Howrah in October last year.National High Speed Rail Corporation Ltd (NHSRCL) had carried out another survey for running a high-speed train on Pt Deen Dayal Upadhyaya-Gaya-Dhanbad-Howah grand chord (GC) route, sources said.Though railways intends to run bullet trains at the maximum speed 350km per hour on Ahmedabad-Mumbai route soon, it needs to do groundwork in Bihar and to run at least semi high-speed trains on Pt Deen Dayal Upadhaya Junction-Howrah mainline and GC routes, sources said . Former chief engineer and technical expert of railways, G N Sahay, said the Union Budget should allocate funds for setting up a separate terminal for MEMU trains on the Hardinge Park land.Railways had proposed to build multi-purpose utility platforms for MEMU and local commuter trains on the Hardinge Park land on the pattern of Mumbai double discharge (DD) platforms. “However, the railways is yet to get possession of the land, he said, adding the proposed Hardinge Park terminal would reduce traffic load on Patna Junction and link the state capital with the north Bihar region.Bihar Daily Passengers’ Association has many expectations from the Union Budget. The demand for a third line between Mokama and Buxar has been pending for long with the Railway Board. Besides, the association expects a semi high-speed train like Duronto or Rajdhani between Patna and New Delhi.According to sources, the Jhajha-Mokama-Patna-Ara-Buxar route has reached more than 160% saturation point. There is an immediate need for a third line on this route to ease traffic movement.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/railways-pins-hopes-on-budget-tocarry-out-various-projects-in-state/articleshow/89190615.cms||---

No Bihar cabinet minister has been included in the list. Those among the party campaigners include its national president Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan, its parliamentary board chairperson Upendra Kushwaha, national secretary general-cum-spokesperson KC Tyagi, national general secretary and Rajya Sabha member Ramnath Thakur, national general secretary and MLC Maulana Ghulam Rasool Baliyawi, national general secretary Harshvardhan Singh, national secretary Ravindra Prasad Singh, Bihar party president Umesh Singh Kushwaha, UP state president Anoop Singh Patel and party’s UP-based leaders like RP Chaudhary, Surendra Tyagi, Sanjay Kumar, Bharat Patel, Sanjay Dhangar and Dr KK Tirpathi. On being asked about the reasons behind the exclusion of top party leaders from the star campaigners’ list, Tyagi told TOI that CM Nitish’s health was not so good that he could go to Uttar Pradesh for campaigning. When asked about RCP, Tyagi said, “No minister either from the Union government or the Bihar government has been included in the list of star campaigners.” JD(U) is an ally of the BJP in Bihar and also at the Centre. In UP, it is contesting the assembly polls on its own as RCP, who was authorized to hold seat-sharing talks with BJP, failed to stitch any alliance with the saffron party. JD(U) has released its first list of 26 assembly constituencies from where the party has decided to field its candidates.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/nitish-and-rcp-not-to-campaign-in-up-polls/articleshow/89190616.cms||Madan Kumar
