---||India||Third wave has likely peaked in 4 of the 8 biggest cities||The third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic appears to have peaked in the four largest cities of the country, with the seven-day average of cases showing a clear decline in Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata and Chennai. However, the seven-day average, calculated till Friday, was still rising in the next four biggest cities of Bengaluru, Pune, Ahmedabad and Hyderabad. But here, too, Bengaluru and Ahmedabad had started showing signs of a slowdown, with daily cases dipping in the past two days, including Saturday, although the trend would have to sustain in the next few days for the seven-day average to start dropping. The larger picture emerging from the Covid data of these eight cities is that the biggest urban centres were now contributing less and less to the country's daily infections. With the seven-day average of national cases still rising, the pandemic now appears to be spreading in the smaller cities and the countryside. Going by the official figures, Bengaluru seems to have been the worst hit city during the current wave. It has recorded the highest peak and may probably end up logging the highest number of cumulative cases. The city has reported 3 lakh cases since December 16, only behind Delhi's total of nearly 3.4 lakh, with the gap narrowing with each day. Mumbai was the first city where the pandemic peaked, with the seven-day average rising to 17,465 on January 12 before beginning to fall. Kolkata was next, reporting the lowest peak among the four largest metros of 7,069 on January 13. Delhi followed two days later with a high of 23,529 on January 15. Chennai posted a peak of 8,578 on January 19. By contrast, Bengaluru's seven-day average stood at 24,091 on January 19 and was still rising, although the city reported a sharp dip on Saturday, with numbers falling to 17,266 from 29,000-odd on the day before. In Mumbai and Delhi, the third-wave surge lasted around four weeks — from the time the seven-day average began to rise consistently till the peak. Kolkata saw the shortest surge of just 20 days while Chennai reported the longest one lasting 32 days. Since the current wave is characterised by a vast number of unreported cases of asymptomatic patients and those with very mild symptoms, the official counts remain merely indicative of trends and are likely to be nowhere close to the actual numbers. Also, some cities could be testing more aggressively than others, leading to higher numbers there. For the record, Hyderabad has the lowest official count of cases among the big eight in the third wave, having reported a little more than 25,000 cases so far since December 16. The city also saw its seven-day average of daily cases rise, then dip slightly before rising again.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/third-wave-has-likely-peaked-in-4-of-the-8-biggest-cities/articleshow/89065427.cms||Amit Bhattacharya

The gigantic exercise involving thousands of trucks is expected to roll out early February. India and Pakistan had been engaged in finalising the modalities for transporting wheat to drought-stricken Afghanistan for almost 2 months. The government is learnt to have conveyed to Pakistan that it will be ready to despatch the first consignment by the second week of next month. India recently sent its third batch of assistance to Kabul, mostly life-saving medicines, by air. Its offer of delivering wheat to Afghanistan through the border with Pakistan though, despite unceasing hostility in ties with Islamabad, is still the most significant initiative in its outreach to the Taliban who returned in August last year to take control of the strategically important country. Pakistan has rarely, if ever, allowed transit facilities for Indian aid to Afghanistan in the past several decades and in 2002 had rejected the same proposal by India when Afghanistan was faced with a similar humanitarian crisis. The Taliban have not just welcomed India's proposal to ship wheat to Afghanistan via Pakistan at this "critical time" but had also sought an early approval from Pakistan PM Imran Khan. ToI had first reported on October 19 that India had contacted Pakistan for transporting 50,000 MT of wheat to Afghanistan. As per the understanding the 2 sides have reached, Afghan trucks operating under UN's World Food Programme (WFP) will ferry Indian wheat from the India-Pakisan border to Afghanistan via Pakistan's Torkham border crossing with Afghanistan. Pakistan had announced earlier this week that it had put all arrangements in place and was awaiting final confirmation from India for the despatch of the first consignment. Official sources denied that there had been any delay by India while recalling that Pakistan had taken well over a month to approve the Indian government's proposal last year. India is still working to resolve logistical issues involved in transporting 50,000 MT of wheat to the border. The exercise has been further complicated by the upcoming elections in Punjab. India also wanted UN to supervise distribution of wheat and other aid to Afghanistan. The security conference on Afghanistan hosted by NSA Ajit Doval in November had called for humanitarian assistance to be provided in an unimpeded, direct and assured manner to Afghanistan and also that the assistance was distributed within the country in a non-discriminatory manner across all sections of the Afghan society.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/india-ready-to-ship-wheat-to-afghanistan-via-pakistan-early-feb/articleshow/89065504.cms||Sachin Parashar

A Jaish-e-Mohammad affiliate was arrested with a grenade in Awantipora, also in south Kashmir, confirmed police later in the day. A senior police officer said the identities of the slain terrorists will be revealed later, adding a joint team of the Army’s 34RR, CRPF and J&K Police launched the cordon-and-search operation based on intelligence inputs about the presence of terrorists in the area when holed-up terrorists opened fire at the search party, triggering an encounter. Meanwhile, J&K Police on Saturday claimed to have arrested a Jaish affiliate with a hand grenade in south Kashmir’s Awantipora. The suspect, identified as Umer Farooq Bhat from Awantipora, was involved in providing shelter, support, logistics and assisting terrorists to travel from one place to another besides aiding in transporting arms and ammunition, as well as sharing sensitive information regarding the movement of police and security forces with Jaish. He was caught by a joint team of Army’s 55RR, CRPF’s 185 Bn and Awantipora Police, confirmed police in a statement. A hand grenade along with other incriminating material was found on him. A case has been registered under relevant sections of the law in this regard and further probe is underway, said the statement.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/trf-duo-killed-in-shopian-encounter-jaish-affiliate-caught-with-grenade-in-awantipora/articleshow/89065536.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||India||Centre will restore J&K's statehood when it returns to normal: Amit Shah||JAMMU: J&K will get back its statehood "once the situation there becomes normal", Union home minister Amit Shah iterated on Saturday, seeking to silence "some people who want to create confusion in the minds of the people of the Valley". Speaking at the virtual launch of the Good Governance Index, Shah said the delimitation of constituencies was underway and elections would be declared on completion of the process. He said J&K was "a priority" for PM Narendra Modi and no effort was being spared to put it on the path to development. "People have said many things, but I want to tell you that I had given an assurance in Parliament that the statehood of Jammu and Kashmir will be restored," Shah said. "I request everyone not to fall into their trap." The home minister said democracy had already percolated down to the grassroots in J&K, "which is why some people are worried". He was alluding to the panchayat polls and the first ever district development council (DDC) elections in December 2020, just over a year after the nullification of Article 370 took away J&K's special status. "Major changes began in 2019 under the leadership of Shri Modi in J&K. Earlier, only 87 MLAs, six MPs and three families used to share power; today more than 30,000 people’s representatives from the village-level upwards are serving the people," Shah said. "Those who were saying that violence will increase, they should be asked whether it has gone up or declined. If we undertake a comparative study of the period from April 2017 to 2019 and 2019 to 2021, then there has been a 40 per cent decline in terrorist-related incidents and a 57 per cent drop in casualties since Article 370 was abrogated." He also challenged those who said investment wouldn't come to J&K. "The fact is that already Rs 12,000 crore in investment has come. Tourist arrivals have also gone up." Shah asked the youth of the Valley to take note of the changes that had taken place at the initiative of the local administration and PM Modi's guidance. "I want to tell everyone, especially youths of the Valley, to focus on development and be a part of the process." The home minister said everyone knew that tourism in J&K was directly linked to employment, but those with vested interest had hatched a conspiracy to portray the Valley as being still unsafe for visitors. "I want to tell those people who had to go to Pakistan or other foreign countries to study medicine that since Independence till 2014, J&K had just four medical colleges with 500 seats. Now, nine medical colleges have been built alongside 15 nursing colleges. They together offer 1,100 MBBS seats and 600 paramedical seats," he said. Union minister Dr Jitendra Singh and J&K lt governor Manoj Sinha were part of the virtual event.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-will-restore-jks-statehood-when-it-returns-to-normal-amit-shah/articleshow/89065548.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

It has fined Kolkata Airport Rs 20 lakh — the steepest penalty imposed to date by the regulator — for lapses like improper maintenance of runway. And Bengaluru-based Star Air has been fined Rs 5 lakh for violating safety norms like an aircraft panel not being closed properly before departure and then falling off during landing. “An audit was done of NSCBIA some months back. Non-violation of norms were observed in some areas, mainly improper maintenance of runway, electrical lighting, foreign object debris programme. After the lapses were found, a showcase notice was issued to the airport operator as action can be taken only after seeking comments from the agency concerned,” said people in the know. After examining comments from Kolkata Airport operator, the DGCA decide to levy a fine of Rs 20 lakh. Similarly, DGCA had audited Star Air last November that revealed some non-compliances. These included deficiencies in flight operations quality assurance (FOQA) monitoring and airline utilising trainers and examiners of a foreign approved training organisation beyond the period of approval given by DGCA. “Star Air doesn’t have a documented procedure in respect of system to handle passenger carrying dangerous goods that are not permitted to be carried on-board aircraft. An aircraft panel was not closed properly before departure and fell off at the time of landing. However, it was projected as rivet failure,” the audit findings of Star Air say. Following this, DGCA imposed a penalty of Rs five lakh on the airline under Rule 162 of the Aircraft Rules, 1937. Comments were sought from Airports Authority of India, which operates Kolkata’s Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose International Airport (NSCBIA), and awaited till the time of going to press. A Star Air spokesperson said: “All the non compliances are minor. On a grade of severity level from 1 to 10, DGCA has judged them as Level 3. Further, Star Air does not agree with the issued non compliances and will be exercising our right to appeal against the same.” The provisions of levying fines were added by a special section introduced in the Aircraft Act in September 2020. Subsequently, last May an enabling provision was introduced to provide for levying financial penalty against service providers for violation of regulations/requirement. The fine imposed on NSCBIA is the highest so far. This is the second string of action by DGCA under its new powers to impose fines. Last October two flying training organisations (FTO), including government-run Indira Gandhi Rashtriya Uran Akademi, were penalised Rs 75,000 each for norm violations. So till now an airline, airport operator and two FTOs have been fined.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/dgca-cracks-whip-kolkata-airport-penalised-rs-20-lakh-for-lapses-in-runway-maintenance-star-air-fined-rs-5-lakh/articleshow/89065582.cms||Saurabh Sinha
---||India||Election Commission extends ban on election rallies, roadshows till January 31||NEW DELHI: The Election Commission on Saturday extended the ban on physical rallies and roadshows in poll-bound states until January 31 but allowed public meetings by parties and candidates in open spaces, subject to a cap of 500 people, for the campaign of first phase starting January 28 and second phase beginning February 1. So while physical rallies, padayatras, roadshows and car or bike rallies will not be allowed in constituencies going to polls between Phase 3 to Phase 7, in-person public meetings with maximum 500 persons or up to 50% of the ground capacity or existing SDMA limit, whichever is less, may be conducted between January 28 and February 8 in 58 assembly constituencies of UP going to polls in the first phase and between February 1 and 12 for 55 assembly seats in UP for second phase and the whole of Goa and Uttarakhand. Roadshows and padyatras will remain barred till January 31 even in constituencies going to polls in the first two phases. Roadshows, padyatras and bike and car rallies, however, remain banned till January 31 across all constituencies irrespective of phases. Election Commission sources said the Covid situation is expected to turn around and vaccination coverage likely to reach satisfactory levels by January 31, when the panel will review campaign restrictions next. If the Covid situation eases, physical meetings with a similar cap may eventually be allowed across all phases. The panel, which took stock of the Covid situation in the five poll-bound states in virtual meetings with the Union health secretary and the respective state chief secretaries and chief electoral officers, also allowed video vans for publicity in open spaces. Justifying the relaxation for physical rallies, a senior official said that since candidates would be finalised by January 27, the last date for withdrawal of nominations, it was felt that they should be given a fair opportunity to directly reach out to voters. While allowing physical meetings, the EC went by two factors — vaccination coverage in poll-bound states, which has lately shown marked improvement, as well as hospitalisation rates, which remain in check. As per data placed before the EC, first dose vaccination coverage now stands at 100% in Goa, 99% in Uttarakhand, 97% in UP, 81% in Punjab and 58% in Manipur; while the second dose coverage is at 98% in Goa, 85% in Uttarakhand, 64% in UP, 52% in Punjab and 44% in Manipur. Hospitalisation rate is 1.4% in UP, 1.7% in Uttarakhand, 1.7% in Punjab, 3.4% in Goa and 8.8% in Manipur. “This shows that most people are recovering without much pressure on medical facilities,” said an EC official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/election-commission-extends-ban-on-election-rallies-roadshows-till-january-31/articleshow/89065677.cms||Bharti Jain

One of them, Lokesh Khatik, 53, who has been running a small tea stall at Khurgan road for the past three decades, told TOI that he had indeed left Kairana after his son started consuming drugs and racked up large bills running into lakhs. He said that he feared for his son's life and therefore moved to Panipat in 2013. He added that he returned in 2018. "But I feel anguished when I see the people who forced my son to consume drugs roam freely. Nothing has happened to them,” he said. Varun Singhal's family was also one of the few who the home minister met. Varun's elder brother Vinod Singhal was allegedly shot dead by extortionists in August 2014 while the latter was sitting outside a grocery store. Varun said he migrated from the city soon after his brother’s alleged murder but "came back in 2015", two years before the Yogi-led BJP state government took charge. “Almost all top politicians visited our home after my brother's murder. Everyone told me that my sister-in-law, who is a single parent to three children, will get financial help. Even Yogi ji came to my house during his visit to Kairana and assured us of financial help. However, nothing has happened so far,” Varun claimed. Shah then met the family of Rajkumar Singhal, who owns an electrical shop in Kairana. Rajkumar told TOI that he never migrated but was "only planning" to do so.

One of the families whose picture with Shah is making rounds on social media is that of Rakesh Garg, the owner of the 'Sadu Sweets' shop. Garg migrated from Kairana after someone tried to extort Rs 20 lakh from him in 2014. He said he returned after 2017 "once the situation changed." In June 2016, BJP MP from Kairana Hukum Singh alleged that around 250 Hindu families had migrated from the town, leaving behind their properties, out of the "fear of criminals who enjoyed political patronage." The issue became a major controversy after BJP accused the ruling Samajwadi Party of pursuing "minority appeasement" policies.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/going-door-to-door-in-kairana-amit-shah-meets-families-that-had-left/articleshow/89065744.cms||Ishita Mishra

---||India||PM Modi tells DMs to focus on time-bound delivery of govt programmes to felicitate ease of living||NEW DELHI: Citing success stories from “aspirational” districts, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday urged district magistrates to identify 10 tasks to be completed in the next three months to improve ease of living of the common people. The PM stressed time-bound targets for taking roads to all the villages of the districts, ayushman cards, bank account to every person, Ujjwala gas connection, insurance pension and housing for everyone. “Aspirational districts are now eliminating the barriers to the progress of the country. They have become accelerators for growth instead of impediments,” he said while interacting with DMs across the country as he detailed success stories in aspirational districts. He referred to the sharp increase in enrollment of pregnant women in government-run health programmes from 37% to 97% in Chattarpur district in Madhya Pradesh, the increase in institutional delivery in Arunachal’s Namsai district, Mewat in Haryana and Dhalai in Tripura among others. The PM said several ministries and departments of the government have prepared a list of 142 districts which are weak on one or two parameters and emphasised the need to work with the same collective approach as is being done in the aspirational districts. “This is a new challenge for all the governments — the Government of India, the state governments, the district administrations, and the government machinery. Now we have to complete this challenge together,” said Modi. The Centre and states will work together to uplift these identified districts to address the pockets of under-development and 15 sectors linked to 15 ministries and departments were identified. The PM said the country is witnessing a silent revolution in the form of Digital India and no district should be left behind in this. He stressed the importance for digital infrastructure reaching every village and becoming a means of door-step delivery of services and facilities. He asked Niti Aayog to devise a mode of regular interaction between the DMs and central ministries were asked to document the challenges of these districts.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-tells-dms-to-focus-on-time-bound-delivery-of-govt-programmes-to-felicitate-ease-of-living/articleshow/89065810.cms||---

The fire started around 6.45am at the 20-storeyed Sachinam Heights, situated opposite Bhatia Hospital in Tardeo, fire brigade officials said. Many of the building’s residents were still asleep when the blaze began. They said when they realized what was happening, the lights had gone out and there was thick black smoke all along the building’s corridors as they rushed to escape from the staircase. A short circuit was the likely cause of the fire. Officials said three persons died of burns and three others died due to suffocation as they inhaled smoke. While five of the six victims were identified, the body of a man at Nair hospital was yet to be identified till late Saturday. Police said the body was charred beyond recognition and they would have to do DNA tests of family members to identify the man. The five other dead were identified as Hitesh Subodh Mistry, 40, Mausmi Subodh Mistry, 45, and Meena Subodh Mistry, 65, who stayed in Flat No. 1904, Purshottam Chopdekar, 42, who stayed on the 16th floor, and Manjuben Kantharia, another 19th floor resident. Of the 24 injured, 17 people were still admitted in hospitals at the time of going to press. The fire is suspected to have spread through the electrical duct right through the length of the building, resulting in thick smoke all over. Flat No 1904, where the fire burst out, was gutted, along with parts of corridors. While the building, which is the rehabilitation component of a redevelopment project being carried out by Kamala Group, received an Occupation Certificate in 2015, fire brigade officials said its firefighting equipment was not functional, nor had the building submitted the mandatory bi-annual fire audit report. PM Modi expressed grief over the incident and announced on Twitter that ex-gratia of 2 lakh would be provided to family members of each of the deceased from the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund. He added that the injured would be given 50,000 each. State tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray, who visited the site, said the government will provide compensation of 5 lakh to family members of each of the deceased.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/six-die-in-mumbai-highrise-fire-grandkids-carry-86-year-old-out/articleshow/89065859.cms||---

It was retained in 2020 and 2021 at the last moment after a major outcry over the government’s move to discard it from the musical spectacle, which is performed by massed military bands at Vijay Chowk on the majestic Rajpath to signal the end of the Republic Day celebrations every year. “The beautiful ‘Abide with Me’ was part of the sombre ceremony without any religious connotations for decades. Its poignancy, even as the sun set behind Raisina Hill with Rashtrapati Bhavan, Parliament, North and South Blocks being lit up, reminded us of our fallen comrades. Sad to see it be discarded this year,” said a senior officer. On being contacted by TOI, a defence ministry official said, “’Abide with Me’ has been replaced with the popular ‘Ae Mere Watan ke Logon’ during the ongoing ‘Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav’ to commemorate 75 years of Independence.” Written by Kavi Pradeep and composed by C Ramchandra, ‘Ae Mere Watan ke Logon’ was hauntingly sung by Lata Mangeshkar for the first time during the Republic Day celebrations in 1963 to honour the 3,250 soldiers who made the ultimate sacrifice during the 1962 war with China. Officials say western tunes are being replaced by ‘swadeshi’ tunes composed by Indian composers over the past few years, with the patriotic ‘Sare Jahan se Acha’ also replacing the older tradition of playing ‘Abide with Me’ at the end of ceremony. In earlier years, apart from Indian tunes, the military bands played western tunes like the evergreen ‘Colonel Bogey’, written in 1914, and ‘Sons of the Brave’, composed in 1898, which were borrowed from the British. They have all been gradually discarded. ‘Drummers Call’, in fact, will be the only western tune in the ceremony this year, which will also see a drone and laser show. The 24 Indian tunes include ‘Kadam Kadam Badhaye Ja’, ‘Veer Sainik’, ‘Hey Kanchha’, ‘Swarn Jayanti’ and ‘Golden Arrows’, among others.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mahatmas-fav-hymn-abide-with-me-dropped-from-beating-retreat/articleshow/89065997.cms||Rajat Pandit

Since several states have substantial unspent balances lying with them, funds against allocations couldn’t be disbursed to them. As per information shared by the home ministry with Kerala-based RTI activist K Govindan Nampoothiry in a reply dated January 12, 2022 to his RTI query, the largest chunk of police modernisation funds released in 2021-22 went to Karnataka (Rs 31 crore), which also happened to be the only state to have utilised the funds released until December 31, 2021. While the funds released in 2021-22 also went to UP (Rs 32 crore), Rajasthan (Rs 14 crore), Tripura (Rs 6.8 crore) and Chhattisgarh (Rs 5.4 crore), they reported zero utilisation — as reflected in utilisation certificates required to be furnished by the states — until December 31, 2021. The situation was not too different in 2021-22. Of the Rs 103 crore funds released, which was far lower than the Rs 759 crore disbursed under the police modernisation scheme in 2018-19 and Rs 781 crore in 2019-20, barely Rs 9 crore was utilised by states. Karnataka was the only state to have utilised the police modernisation funds released in 2020-21. Sources said the finance ministry has since the last couple of years made norms for release of funds to the states under central schemes tougher, requiring utilisation certificates to be submitted by the state before a fresh release can be made. Where on account of non-receipt of utilisation certificates from some states, for which it was not possible to release funds to those states, such unreleased amounts are pooled and released to the states with no pending or overdue utilisation certificates as ‘better performance incentives’, in proportion of the inter-state distribution ratio. Nampoothiry told TOI that data shared by MHA reflected the lackadaisical approach of many states in utilisation the funds allotted for modernising their police force, even when threats to internal security were increasing. “Timely audit of the progress of police force modernisation, from procurement of modern weapons to services rendered, is the need of the hour as the challenges to internal security as well as border regions rise. The home ministry should ensure that the funds are utilised effectively and aligned with the vision of upgrading the police force to the next level. States like Punjab, Gujarat and Haryana and the UT of Kashmir should be more vigilant,” he said. The funding ratio as per the central scheme for assistance to states for police modernisation is 60:40 between the Centre and states for all states except the eight northeastern states and the two Himalayan states of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, for which the funding pattern is 90:10.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sharp-fall-in-cop-revamp-funds-as-states-fail-to-utilise-them/articleshow/89066170.cms||Bharti Jain

India’s first woman to scale Mt Everest in 1984 wasn’t joking, but then the plan went cold as everyone hunkered down for the pandemic to pass. Pal, 67, didn’t give up and now 10 women are getting ready for an adventure of a lifetime this March. Pal, a Padma Bhushan awardee, and her friends met in Maharashtra’s Wardha recently for an event and decided to get on with the expedition. “There’s a lot happening with the ‘Fit India’ campaign. We want to show that those above the age of 50 can be physically fit too,” Pal said. Her friends are accomplished mountaineers—some have scaled Mt Everest and some were part of her pre-Everest treks. The plan was exciting, but their age made them think twice. “It will take almost five months to complete this expedition,” said Chetna Sahoo, 54, of Kolkata who climbed Mt Everest with her (now late) husband Pradeep in 2016. “I mapped the route. Any trans-Himalayan expedition requires crossing a number of passes. If all goes to plan, we will start from Arunachal Pradesh in March and end at Tiger Hill (of Kargil War fame) around five months later,” she said. Bimla Negi-Deoskar and husband Avinash have trained tribal youth from Chandrapur, Maharashtra, to scale Mt Everest. She is part of the expedition, which she said is about breaking stereotypes. “Usually when you enter the late-50s zone, the focus is on relaxing and settling into a retired life. But retirement can be a new beginning, with new avenues to explore,” said the 54-year-old from Nagpur.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ten-women-aged-50-67-plan-an-expedition-of-himalayan-proportions/articleshow/89066252.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Business||‘Blursday’ to ‘extrepreneur’: Gen Z terms meet corp talk||Arpit Agarwal neither circles back nor reverts. He responds or gets back to people. He also does not ping or say ‘Cheers’. He schedules calls and says, ‘Have a nice day’. And despite being the director of an engineering and management college that promotes research-oriented education, the 44-year-old won’t be caught encouraging ‘deep dives’ so much as “in-depth or analytical studies”. No wonder in September this year, when his institute reopened to 50 per cent capacity post lockdown, Agarwal was stumped when the word ‘netlag’ floated into his ears for the first time. A young professor had used the term to describe the feeling of not knowing how to react to the real world after being online for a long time. Netlag, then, could both signify and explain the recent disruption in official exchanges. Even as employees return to hybrid workspaces, their constant toggling between online and offline meetings appears to be loosening and stiffening the tie of management-jargon. If Gen Z colloquialisms ranging from 'Blursday' to 'extrepreneur' and virtual-conferencing hangovers spanning 'cheers' to 'Zoombie' are softening the built-in scowls of management argot, imported management buzzwords are adding to its trite redundancies. People who were known as business tycoons, for instance, are now 'extrepreneurs' (extreme serial entrepreneurs) and rather than looking into an issue later, the management types are “putting a pin in it”. Given the sheer number of times pins are being put in things or the proverbial “needle” is being “moved”, global business-speak, it seems, is crying for its own anti-jab movement. “The pandemic altered the cultural fabric and wiring of organizations around the world,” explains Saurabh Singh, senior knowledge advisor at Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) India, citing the explosion of phrases such as ‘polywork’ (having multiple jobs at once) and ‘moonlighting’ (working two jobs at the same time) in India as verbal after-effects of that churn. “As adaptability and productivity of employees went up, the freedom of operating from the confines of our rooms, brought in a sense of openness and casualness not just in our attire but also our behaviour,” says Singh. Besides the air-fillers spawned by caffeinated online meetings in the last two years, “working with people from different time zones further led to the rise of different phrases,” says Sonya Hooja, COO and co-founder of a professional education firm who stumbled upon ‘Miss Rona’, the new code for the coronavirus in much the same way that she learnt that ‘Blursday’ was the shorthand for indistinguishable days of the week during the pandemic: during a group conversation with Gen Z colleagues. Though she suspects that a lot of pandemic terms that have bled into our everyday vocabulary might outlive the virus, Hooja thinks that “overused” terms such as “360 reviews”, “low-hanging fruit”, “Zoom fatigue” and “quaranteams” are fading out of corporate lexicon. With organizations eager to embrace inclusivity, mental health issues and social-minded Gen Zers, the language of therapy is colouring HR interactions. “ Human and employee experience has become as important and viable a theme as flexi and hybrid working,” says Singh, who has heard several Indian offices speak of video apps democratizing corporate hierarchies by “bringing everyone together on the same plane” (as in screen) and “providing everyone with the same square foot of visibility” (as in box or the circle where our faces appear). Besides, “allyship” — the role of a person who advocates for inclusion of a “marginalized or politicized group” in solidarity but not as a member — emerged as Dictionary.com’s word of the year in 2021. Genuine or not, just as tenth graders must now relearn the analog art of longhand before the board exams, it might serve the suits well to share a beverage instead of chasing ‘leverage’. “It’s all about co-existing, learning and adapting in this multi-generational world,” says Singh, whose embrace of the acronyms of millennials and the slangs of younger digital natives such as ‘Wack’ and ‘Yikes’ reflects in the smileys punctuating his mails. “The roads have speech-breakers either way,” adds Singh, who recalls a colleague recently asking him “When are you logging off?” when she meant “When are you going home?” Hashtag Netlag.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/blursday-to-extrepreneur-gen-z-terms-meet-corp-talk/articleshow/89066278.cms||शर्मिला गणेशन

---||---||PariWar in Uttar Pradesh: Politics challenges kinship||LUCKNOW: Is political water really thicker than blood? The UP assembly elections have thrown up cases where differences in leanings within influential political families have come out widely in the open. So, while defection of SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav’s younger daughter-in-law Aparna Yadav, his relatives – Hari Om Yadav and Pramod Gupta – to BJP hogged all the limelight, cases of brewing schism within other political families are also conspicuous in the current poll season. The latest being the influential Shakya family in Auraiya. Here, Riya Shakya — daughter of rebel BJP MLA from Bidhuna Vinay Shakya, who switched over to SP — will contest as a BJP candidate from her father’s constituency. Riya’s inclination towards BJP had become apparent on January 11 when she released a video to show her “staunch support” to the party while claiming that her uncle Devesh Shakya forcibly took her ailing father to get him join SP.  Assembly elections 2022: Complete coverage Poll schedule Detailed coverage UP elections Punjab elections Uttarakhand elections Goa elections Manipur elections This was the day when UP minister and BJP leader Swami Prasad Maurya revolted against the saffron outfit. Riya’s claim was, however, refuted by Vinay, who, along with Maurya, eventually joined SP on January 14. Riya’s rivals in the poll battle are likely to be either her father or uncle. SP is yet to announce its candidate from Bidhuna. The political rift also hit the family of former Congress leader Imran Masood. While Imran moved to SP, terming it as the only political party which could challenge the might of BJP, his twin brother Noman Masood has crossed over to Maywati’s BSP and has even got a ticket to contest from Gangoh. Noman had earlier joined RLD at the peak of farmers’ stir against the new farm laws. Both Imran and Noman had contested from Nakur and Gangoh assembly seats as Congress candidates in 2017 assembly elections. Imran lost to BJP’s Dharam Singh Saini, who has now defected to SP and has even got a ticket to contest from Nakur in the upcoming polls. Noman was defeated by BJP’s Pradeep Chaudhary. So is the case with the family of Swami Prasad Maurya, whose daughter Sanghmitra Maurya dug in her heels and reposed faith in BJP and PM Modi. Sanghmitra, who is a BJP MP from Budaun, has been consistently taking to social media to laud the BJP and hashtagging “aayegi to BJP hi” (BJP will come back to power). The differences of opinion also hit the family of BSP MP from Ambedkarnagar, Ritesh Pandey, earlier this month when his father and former BSP MP Rakesh Pandey defected to SP. Considered to have a hold on upper castes in Ambedkarnagar, Rakesh’s defection was seen as a significant blow to Mayawati who has gone back to her tried and tested social engineering formula of Dalit, Brahmin unity that propelled her to power with absolute majority for the first time in 2007. Political experts consider this as a sign of “maturity of democracy”. “It is a good sign to see people giving priority to their political leanings and acting accordingly,” said Prof Ramesh Dixit, retired head of the political science department in Lucknow University.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/pariwar-in-uttar-pradesh-politics-challenges-kinship/articleshow/89066433.cms||Pankaj Shah

On the ground, this has “unnerved” local minority leaders and may hurt the alliance candidates’ prospects in some seats, say analysts. The pattern rivals that of BJP, which has also fielded only Hindu candidates in the region. Congress, on the other hand, has fielded two Muslims and BSP three. Leaders of the SP-RLD combine fear that fielding candidates from the minority community could lead to a division of votes, directly benefiting BJP. But, it could also be counterproductive and lead to a drift of Muslim voters. As per official estimates, Muzaffarnagar has a population of about 25 lakh, roughly 42% of them Muslims. BJP emerged victorious in all seats back in 2017 after fielding only Hindu candidates. BSP had fielded three Muslims then and SP one. In this election, both Congress and BSP have fielded Muslim candidates from Charthawal and Meerapur seats. Mursaleen Rana, ex-BSP MLA, who had joined RLD recently and wanted to contest from Charthawal, said, "The RLD wanted to give tickets to Muslims in Muzaffarnagar, but SP was not keen.

A division bench of justices Ravi Shekhar Jha and Arun Palli on Thursday disposed of the petition with the direction that if further information about the condition of any government schools is passed on to the government by the IPA, the state education department should take appropriate action on the same. “We welcome the decision of the court. Moreover, it has made it clear that in the future if we bring such facts and findings, then the government should take action on the same. We will be compiling all the documents and sending it to the government,” said AIPA national president Ashok Aggarwal. In their petition, the association alleged that the 55 government schools across 10 districts of the state are in a shambles, with several buildings posing grave risks to the teachers and the students. It also asked the court to form panels, headed by respective deputy commissioners, to conduct an audit of all state schools. To back their claims, the parents’ body, in collaboration with an NGO Social Jurist, claimed to have conducted an independent preliminary audit of several schools in Haryana. “In the new petition, we demanded that the department expedite the work on these 55 schools. Three of these schools are from Gurgaon,” said AIPA national secretary Kailash Sharma. In October 2019, the association filed its first petition in the court regarding the dilapidated buildings of about eight schools in Faridabad and Palwal, prompting the government to release funds for repair work. “We will now look into the claims of the AIPA and take steps based on the findings of our investigation,” said a senior education department official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/parents-move-hc-for-audit-of-55-govt-schools/articleshow/89066489.cms||Siddharth Tiwari
---||Gurgaon||Gurugram: Schools launch drive, demand reopening||GURUGRAM: A section of private schools and their welfare bodies have decided to launch a statewide campaign, 'Siksha Bachao, School Kholo', from Monday, demanding the immediate reopening of schools for classes 1 to 12. While some schools are holding discussions with the education department to hasten the reopening, others are seeking to drum up enough support to force the government not to extend school closure beyond January 26. Under the Private Schools Welfare Association (PSWA) banner, these schools have decided to meet the deputy commissioners in their districts and hand over a memorandum addressed to the chief minister. On Tuesday, the representatives of these schools will meet the BJP and JJP MLAs. “We have decided to launch a statewide campaign against the irrational ban on schools, which have been closed for the longest time in the name of Covid. However, all other activities are going on,” said PSWA president Ram Avtar Sharma. The closure, schools contested, has adversely impacted school-parent relations and learning levels among students. Educationists argued that barring a few leading private schools, most suffered to manage the transition to online education. The situation has been worse in the rural districts where students have remained out of schools for nearly two years. “The reports from World Bank and former RBI chief Raghuram Rajan have stated that prolonged closure of schools has led to learning gaps among students. No study supports school closure as a Covid mitigation strategy but the government has mindlessly closed schools without assessing the impact. Students have lost interest in studies, schools have been finding it difficult to impart online education, parents are unwilling to pay for virtual classes,” said Kulbhushan Sharma, president, National Independent Schools Alliance, an association of budget private schools.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/schools-launch-drive-demand-reopening/articleshow/89066490.cms||Siddharth Tiwari
---||Gurgaon||Gurugram: Sushant Lok residents hit the streets to save a park||GURUGRAM: Braving the cold weather conditions, residents of Sushant Lok-1 took to the streets on Saturday morning to save a park of the colony from destruction. They urged the district administration to stop alleged attempts by the developer to turn the green lung into a healthcare facility. The residents claimed that the park — spread across 1.2 acres of land in Block C of the colony — was earlier well maintained by the original developer, but it put up a signboard in 2004 saying the site had been earmarked for a dispensary. Some residents approached the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in 2019, which stepped in to stop the alleged attempt to destroy the park and imposed a fine on the developer. The Supreme Court subsequently granted an interim relief to the developer on the penalty part but asked the Ansals to maintain status quo on the possession of all properties in the colony, the residents said. Despite the the Supreme Court’s order, the residents alleged that the developer sold the land on which the park was developed to a private builder, Trueworth Developers Pvt Ltd, whose officials came with bouncers and started barricading the park on Friday amid a heavy police presence. Arun Kakar, a resident of the colony, said, There is a serious contempt of the SC order and the district administration should intervene.” According to the residents, the elderly and the children of the colony frequent the park. “There are 100 trees in the park and some are 20 years old, which is the green lung of the area, and now they want to build a hospital,” said JC Kalra, one of the petitioners in the case. However, Trueworth Developers refuted the claims and said that the land has been earmarked as a dispensary since the date of inception of Sushant Lok -1 by the DTCP. “Some local residents, with vested interests, dragged the matter to court stating it as a park. The lower court and the sessions court have dismissed their petitions with detailed orders,” said Arun Kumar Arora, its director. “There is no stay by any court on this dispensary site. Some people are misguiding the residents by showing a top court order, which is not at all related to this site,” he added. Deputy commissioner Yash Garg said, “I have asked the DTCP to examine the matter, and appropriate action will be taken as per rules.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/sushant-lok-residents-hit-the-streets-to-save-a-park/articleshow/89066491.cms||Akanksha Gupta

Meanwhile, a total of 7,786 patients recovered on Saturday, with the city recording the highest number of recoveries in a day. This brought down the number of active cases to 20,113 on Saturday from 25,306 on Friday. The positivity rate also dropped to 30.9% on Saturday from 33.7% on Friday. Of the active patients, 177 are in hospitals and 19,936 in home isolation. “We have reached a plateau; the number of cases will likely go down in the coming days. We are already witnessing less number of people coming for Covid tests. The recovery of over 7,000 patients is the highest in a single day since the beginning of the pandemic. So, it is also a good indicator,” said Virender Yadav, the chief medical officer. However, the city reported two more Covid deaths, including a 70-year-old man and a 72-year-old woman, taking the number of deaths since the pandemic began to 944. The woman was fully vaccinated, health officials said. However, she had diabetes, hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis, hypothyroidism, post-colostomy and other comorbidities. The 70-year-old man was unvaccinated and got admitted to the hospital after a stroke, said the health officials. The city added 17 deaths in January, of which 12 deaths got reported in the last one week from January 16 to January 22. The first death got reported on January 10. Health officials said they have been emphasising vaccination and booster doses. “We will hold camps at five religious places on Sundays, giving second and booster doses and also covering children aged 15-17 years,” said Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer. The sites include the New Colony Gurdwara; Badi Church, Sheetla Colony; Hanuman Temple, Ashok Vihar; Anjuman, Jama Masjid, Sector 57; and Jain Mandir, Sadar Bazar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/city-sees-2-more-covid-deaths-new-cases-come-down-by-1000/articleshow/89066492.cms||Vishakha Chaman

But no one has come forward to claim or adopt these babies, who are at a child care centre in the city. The police have so far arrested 14 members of the gang, which was active across Delhi-NCR for the past eight years. Of the five infants that the cops have rescued, four are girls. The gang, the police said, would buy babies from poor couples who could not afford to raise them. The price of the infant depended on the skin colour and facial features — a fair baby, for instance, would cost more than one with a dark complexion. Once the babies were identified, their pictures would be circulated among gang members in various states. These gang members would, in turn, get in touch with childless couples or communities that raise children for street performances. Most of these babies would be sold to such communities in Rajasthan, the police said. The gang trafficked more baby girls than boys because of its connection to sex trade rackets, according to the police. The cops said they were trying to trace the biological parents of the infants. “We have rescued the babies, but no one has come forward to claim them. They are at a child care centre now,” said Manoj Kumar, the station house officer of DLF Phase 3 police station. Covers were lifted off the trafficking gang on January 8, when an alert cab driver from the city had driven straight to the DLF 3 police station and got three of the members arrested. The cabbie had suspected something amiss after overhearing a telephonic conversation between one of the woman members and a possible couple who wanted to buy an infant. The deal, though, fell through. That day, the three persons had stopped Umesh Lohia’s cab near Dhaula Kuan in Delhi and asked him for a lift to IFFCO Chowk. Lohia, who was anyway returning home to Nathupur in the city, agreed as the two women had a newborn each in their arms and it was drizzling. Just a few minutes into the ride, the two women — who were seated in the back — asked Lohia if he could drop them to Alwar in Rajasthan. The cabbie agreed, saying it could cost them Rs 3,000. A little later, one of the women asked him to drop them back to Delhi from Alwar and take Rs 4,000 for the round trip. Kumar said the three who were nabbed on the first day were identified as Neha, Surender Kaur and Harjinder. Two more women were arrested the next day. So far, 14 gang members have been arrested. “There are more gang members who are still on the run. We are trying to trace them,” the SHO said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/5-infants-rescued-from-gang-police-struggle-to-trace-kin/articleshow/89066493.cms||Bagish Jha
---||Gurgaon||Gurugram: Youth uploads fight video on Insta, thrashed with sticks and iron rods||GURUGRAM: An 18-year-old youth from Sakatpur village was allegedly attacked with iron rods and sticks on Friday after a dispute over an Instagram post. The youth, Mohit, had allegedly posted a video showing a fight between two boys in his village. One of these youths had allegedly asked Mohit to delete the post, which led to an argument. On Friday morning, Mohit and his friends Gulfam and Tanwar were headed towards a hill for a walk. Mohit received a call from Sitesh, who had asked him to delete the post. After a few minutes, Sitesh, Nikhil and 10-15 other youths reached near the hill on bikes and allegedly attacked Mohit with sticks and rods. His friends were overpowered. Sitesh, police said, hit Mohit’s head with an iron rod while Nikhil attacked him with a sharp object in the hand. They fled the spot, but threatened to kill Mohit the next time. “Nikhil put a pistol on my head and threatened to kill me the next time,” Mohit said from his hospital bed. Mohit was initially taken to the Civil Hospital, but his family shifted him to a private facility later. After the police were informed, a case was registered under sections 148 (rioting), 149 (rioting with weapon), 323 (causing hurt), 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC and relevant provisions of the Arms Act. Mohit’s father Mustafa, who runs a fabrication shop in Badshapur, said his son had received a WhatsApp video showing Sitesh and Nikhil fighting with each other. Mohit uploaded the video on Instagram. “But he also removed the post when some of his friends raised objections. Despite that, he was attacked by a few youths from the village,” he added. Police spokesperson Subhash Boken said they were conducting searches to arrest the accused. “Police are trying to identify and track the accused,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/youth-uploads-fight-video-on-insta-thrashed-with-sticks-and-iron-rods/articleshow/89066494.cms||---

But it wasn’t alone. Along with it was a few stray dogs who, too, were being taken to a shelter home.The monkey, which residents said had been trained to perform tricks and street acts, was found loitering on the roads of Sector 15A on Friday. As it shook hands and danced to Hindi tunes, a few passersby obliged with food. After local resident Arti Chopra alerted the RWA, an animal ambulance was called to take the monkey to a shelter home in Sector 94. When the ambulance picked up the monkey, there were already a few stray dogs in it. On the way, the monkey managed to push the door open and walk out along with the other animals. Having done that, it quietly returned to the area from where it had been picked up. “We have no idea where the monkey came from. But one thing is absolutely sure. It is a trained Rhesus monkey. It had obviously been living with street performers since it was moving around, shaking hands and entertaining people,” said Mandeep Singh Vinaik, an RWA member of Sector 15A. Vinaik said that since the monkey had become used to staying in a human habitat, it should not be let out in the wild. “It won’t survive in the wild as the monkeys there will kill him. So, we had arranged for a shelter home for the animal,” he said.Back again in the area on Saturday, it walked up to residents and performed some acts. “On Saturday morning, the monkey was spotted again near the sports and cultural club. It started doing the usual acts it had been taught, jumping up and down all the while. But unfortunately, some people got scared and started running away. One of them hit the monkey, which may have fractured its hand,” said Vinaik. Vinaik’s daughter Ragini spotted the tired and injured monkey, which even slept on her lap. “We contacted animal behaviouralist Vineet Arora, who managed to take the monkey away. The hapless animal is now in the shelter home and is being treated there,” she said. Anuradha Dogra of the animal shelter in Sector 94 said, “The monkey has a swelling in the left arm. We suspect a fracture only.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/monkey-unbolts-ambulance-door-walks-out-with-strays/articleshow/89066496.cms||---

The accused were arrested following a shootout in Sector 62. “We had received a complaint on Friday evening where the complainant said that he was waiting near Sector 62 roundabout to head towards Anand Vihar Bus stand. Four men in a car approached him and offered to drop him to the location,” said Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police, Noida. He added that the victim agreed and boarded the car.  “Within a few minutes the accused took out their pistols and stole his belongs, including money. The four men thrashed him and threw him out of the car near National Institute of Biologicals in Sector 62,” Singh said. Following the complaint, police teams were formed and inputs about the gangs were developed. “CCTV footages of the area were scanned to identify the car used in the crime. We found that the accused were traveling in a Maruti Suzuki SX4 car. On Saturday afternoon, we managed to zero down on them near Jaipuria roundabout in Sector 62,” the officer added. Police have recovered all the stolen goods and cash of the man they had looted on Friday evening.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/lift-loot-gang-busted-4-held-after-shootout/articleshow/89066498.cms||---

But since we got to know that he tested positive for Covid-19, we have all been praying for his speedy recovery. “Siddarth is currently under isolation and we get to speak to him daily. He is strong, but as parents, we tend to get worried. He seems to be recovering quickly and is waiting to get back to the field and fight for a position in the playing 11,” said Shravan Yadav, Siddarth’s father, who runs a general store in NCR’s Kotgaon area.Wicketkeeper-batsman Aaradhya’s father, Ajai Yadav, who works with the Delhi Police, also feels that Covid-19 has spoilt a great opportunity for his son to shine.“In the warm-up games before the U-19 World Cup and also during the recently concluded Asia Cup, Aaradhya was keeping wickets for the team. I was so happy to see his efforts and hard work pay off for him, but this Covid-19 has spoiled everything. We want to see him play for India soon,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ghaziabad/prayers-for-boys-to-defeat-covid-then-win-the-u-19-wc/articleshow/89066499.cms||---
---||Noida||Noida: Rs 5,000 reward for those taking accident victims to hospital||NOIDA: Good Samaritans who rescue victims of road accidents and take them to a hospital within the ‘golden hour’ will now be rewarded with Rs 5,000. The scheme, DCP (traffic) Ganesh Prasad Saha said, has been rolled out with an aim to restrict the number of fatalities in road crashes and improve road safety in the district which reported over 2,000 fatalities in nearly 4,600 such accidents over the last five years. “Despite efforts, the first responders or people who are the first to spot an accident are still hesitant to help victims fearing police probe,” Saha said. The DCP added that many lives could be saved if a victim can get medical assistance within the ‘golden hour’ — the time period lasting one hour following a traumatic injury during which there is the highest likelihood of preventing death by providing prompt medical care. “People need not worry about the police and instead need to understand that a Good Samaritan will not be liable for any civil or criminal obligation and allowed to leave the hospital immediately,” Saha said. Earlier, the Central government awarded Rs 2,000 to people for helping road accident victims during the ‘golden hour’. The amount, which was revised to Rs 5,000 by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways in October last year, will remain in effect from till March 31, 2026. Saha, meanwhile, said passersby or victims can also inform DIAL 112 — a helpline number of seeking police assistance or fire and ambulance services. “When informed, the traffic department and police teams reach the accident spot and take photographs and videos, which help ascertain the cause of accidents. The traffic police also feed the data on the Integrated Road Accident Database (iRAD) for analysis,” Saha said. Recently, the district police rolled out a drive to paste reflective tapes on vehicles, barricades and pillars to curb accidents during inclement weather conditions. Dense fog conditions, police said, during winter lead to a reduction in visibility and make city roads prone to accidents.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/5k-reward-for-those-taking-accident-victims-to-hospital/articleshow/89066501.cms||---

This is the fourth Covid-related death in the district over the past three days. In this current wave, five patients have died in total in Ghaziabad. Officials said the woman was admitted to LLRM Medical College in Meerut a week ago with complaints of breathlessness. Since she had a severe infection of Hepatitis B, she developed septicaemia too, they said. Her death has been added to Ghaziabad’s tally, which stands at 466 now. During treatment, it was found that the woman had not only developed septicemia, but several of her organs had been affected because of Hepatitis B. She also tested positive for Covid at the hospital. Officials said all her primary and secondary contacts had been tested. Daily cases, meanwhile, dropped below 1,000 again in both Noida and Ghaziabad. While Ghaziabad reported 906 new cases, Noida saw 987 infections. The positivity rate in Ghaziabad hovered around 11.6%. There are 5,794 active cases in the district, but only 68 patients are admitted to hospitals. Most of the people who are in hospitals are aged over 60, while 10% of the patients are children. In Noida, new cases dropped from 1,487 to 987 in 24 hours. The last time cases were below the 1,000-mark in Noida was on January 12, when the city recorded 719 cases.

---||Noida||For doctors testing positive, it’s not mild Covid||NOIDA: Symptoms have been predominantly mild in the current wave of the pandemic but that’s now not how the infection has manifested in several doctors who have tested positive over the past few weeks.  Some of the doctors TOI spoke to said they had been experiencing moderate to severe symptoms of Covid, probably due to the heavy virus load in the environment they operate in, and were taking longer to recover. Dr Arjun Khanna, a senior pulmonologist and critical care specialist at the Yashoda Hospital, got infected the second time during the current surge of the pandemic. He got the infection in 2020, during the first wave. He recalled dealing with the debilitating after-effects of Covid the first time around. “Then, I was serving people getting infected. Since I was a frontline worker, I, too, was infected, and my symptoms were so severe that I had to get admitted for nearly 10 days. However, I continued to give consultations due to the high load of patients. More than the physical ailment, the mental suffering was a major hindrance. I suffered from temporary memory loss, prolonged body ache and irritability during the first wave.” Talking about the latest infection, he added, “This time, it was tough to cope with the disease as the symptoms of the health care workers are much more severe and prolonged.” Dr Ankit Kumar Sinha, a critical care specialist, has also got Covid twice now and had to be hospitalised in the current wave. “During the first wave, I was infected with the virus. But I managed to escape the second wave. I am now showing the same symptoms such as fever, cough and body ache. In case of doctors, due to the high virus load, symptoms have been severe. My recovery this time took 14 days and coping with the post-Covid effects has been a tiring journey,” he said. Other doctors who have got infected twice now shared similar experiences. Dr AP Singh, a senior physician at a Ghaziabad hospital, was infected by the virus twice during the first wave. “During that time, I had a very tight schedule treating 70 patients at a time while we were still figuring out more about the virus. Given my condition, I remained in the ICU for a long time, fighting the virus. “Even after recovering, the after-effects of Covid affected both my physical and mental well-being. I used to undergo Covid tests every 15 days to make sure I am not re-infected and to keep my family and other colleagues safe.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/for-doctors-testing-ve-its-not-mild-covid/articleshow/89066504.cms||Abhijeet Singh

Three persons, two of them minors, have been arrested, and a police team is headed for UP to nab the fourth suspect. Police said the four spotted the girl near the old BEST depot and one of the men, who knew her, questioned her about returning home at that hour and said he wanted to talk to her. As the girl went along, he took her to an empty house's mezzanine floor. His friends followed them and they took turns to rape her before fleeing. According to a police officer, when the girl tried to shout out for help, the men gagged her. Once the men fled the place, the traumatised girl called police over the phone and lodged a complaint. A team of women officers recorded her FIR and identified the four accused, who were from the same vicinity.

---||Mumbai||Truck driver died working, pay kin: Bombay HC to employer||MUMBAI: The Bombay HC has directed an employer and an insurance firm to pay Rs 3 lakh with interest as compensation to the kin of a 54-year -old truck driver who died of a coronary condition in 2003, saying the death was “accelerated due to stress and strain associated with long-distance driving for almost 18 days in trying circumstances’’.  “Any other view of the matter would defeat the beneficial object of the provisions contained in Section 3 of the Employees Compensation Act,1923,” the HC bench held on January 17. 3 lakh payout for trucker who died after driving non-stop for 18 daysNearly two decades after a 54-year-old truck driver died on the job due to heart disease, his family was granted relief with the Bombay high court directing the employer and insurance firm to pay Rs 3 lakh, along with interest. The court made note of the “stress and strain associated with long distance driving for almost 18 days”. While the employer said the death was not due to work pressure, the court observed that the truck had left Mumbai for Ranchi 17-18 days prior to the death. The driver was headed back to Mumbai when the incident occurred. “The distance covered was around 1,800km. There was no second or spare driver. These circumstances deserve adequate consideration,’’ said the HC, noting the “enormity of the situation which a driver faces on account of long and arduous journey for almost 18 days, uninterrupted.’’ The post mortem report had termed it as a natural death due to coronary artery heart disease. The high court judgment said, “The long distance driving for about 3,600km can be expected to generate stress and strain, even subconsciously.’’ The HC allowed an appeal filed by the driver’s widow Harvinder Kaur and other family members. The court directed the employer and insurer, New Indian Assurance Company Ltd to jointly and severally pay out a compensation of almost Rs 3 lakh with 12 per cent interest per annum since December 2003. The HC also directed the employer to pay Rs 25,000 as a penalty. The appeal was against a April 2007 judgment passed by the commissioner for workmen’s compensation and judge, 8th labour court at Mumbai, dismissing an application for compensation for a 2003 death of a person arising from his employment, while driving a truck owned by the employer and insured by the insurance company. The HC judgment said that the commissioner misdirected herself in taking a hyper-technical view of the matter and lost sight of the beneficial object of the Employees’ Compensation Act. The application had said the driver died due to “stress and strain of employment’’ as he had been driving the truck continuously for almost 18 days. Thus, the application claimed compensation of Rs 4 lakh with interest and penalty. The owner admitted he was paying Rs 4,000 as monthly wages and a claim form was submitted to the insurer. The insurer opposed the claim, saying the death was “natural’’ and not due to the use of the vehicle nor an accident out of employment, hence the contingencies in their insurance contract and section 147 of the Motor Vehicles Act, which speaks of third party, was not made out.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/truck-driver-died-working-pay-kin-hc-to-employer/articleshow/89066519.cms||Swati Deshpande

The final call hasn’t been taken yet, but the UAE and Sri Lanka can be safely ruled out.BCCI officials, the chairman of the IPL Governing Council and the interim CEO of the board, who also heads all IPL affairs, met the 10 IPL franchise owners on Saturday. On the issue of the destination, while BCCI wants the IPL in India, all franchise owners agreed that it should be held at a place where it will remain incident-free. If it has to be moved overseas, a majority favoured South Africa.One of the suggestions was that if the event is held in India, it can be held in Mumbai and Navi Mumbai, where three stadiums are available along with as many practice grounds. While four franchises suggested it should either be played in India or be moved to South Africa, one maintained that it should move to the UAE if it can’t be held in India. One franchise believes the UAE should be the only destination.

The fire started around 6.45am at the 20-storeyed Sachinam Heights, situated opposite Bhatia Hospital, fire brigade officials said. Many of the building’s residents were still asleep when the blaze began. They said when they realized what was happening, the lights had gone out and there was thick black smoke all along the building’s corridors as they rushed to escape from the staircase. A short circuit was the likely cause of the fire. Officials said three persons died of burns and three others died due to suffocation as they inhaled smoke. While five of the six victims were identified, the body of a man at Nair hospital was yet to be identified till late Saturday. Police said the body was charred beyond recognition and they would have to do DNA tests of family members to identify the man and hand over the body to his kin. Building’s firefighting system didn’t work, audit report wasn’t submittedWhile one of the victims of the Tardeo tower fire had not been identified, the five other dead were identified as Hitesh Subodh Mistry (40), Mausmi Subodh Mistry (45) and Meena Subodh Mistry (65), who stayed in Flat No. 1904, Purshottam Chopdekar (42), who stayed on the 16th floor, and Manjuben Kantharia, another 19th floor resident. Of the 24 injured, 17 people were still admitted in hospitals at the time of going to press and 7 had been discharged. The fire is suspected to have spread through the electrical duct right through the length of the building, resulting in thick smoke all over. Flat No 1904, where the fire burst out, was gutted, along with parts of corridors on the 19th floor. While the building, which is the rehabilitation component of a redevelopment project being carried out by Kamala Group, received an Occupation Certificate in 2015, fire brigade officials said its firefighting equipment was not functional, nor had the building submitted the mandatory bi-annual fire audit report. The sale component is still under construction. “Fire gutted flat 1904 completely and damaged the common passageway. The firefighting system was not working. The building had not submitted reports of its bi-annual fire safety audit to the fire brigade. The fire brigade is investigating. The last fire mock drill was conducted four years ago. Firemen approached the floor using the staircase and first rescued 28-29 people. None of the people were found in refuge areas. But the entire building was smoke-logged due to a common duct with electric cables running along the length of the building,” said chief fire officer Hemant Parab. An official said, “13 fire engines and 7 water jetties were rushed to douse the fire... The blaze was extinguished by 12.20 pm. There are eight flats on each floor of the building. The blaze engulfed the 19th floor and some occupants got trapped. Most residents ran down using the staircase.” The BMC has ordered a probe. “A committee headed by deputy municipal commissioner Harshad Kale will conduct the inquiry and submit the report within 15 days... The committee will examine the cause of fire in consultation with the CFO, the reasons for the spread of fire... and any illegal addition/alteration... beyond approved plans,” the BMC said. Gamdevi police registered an accidental death report and said they were awaiting the fire brigade’s findings. “If we come across evidence of negligence, we will book those responsible,” said an officer. PM Modi said ex-gratia of Rs 2 lakh would be provided to family of each of the deceased from the PM’s National Relief Fund. The injured would be given Rs 50,000 each. State tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray said the government will provide compensation of Rs 5 lakh to family of each of the deceased. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi urged party workers to help those affected.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/6-die-in-early-morning-blaze-at-tardeo-tower-fire-system-failed/articleshow/89066509.cms||Ahmed Ali

---||Mumbai||SC gives interim relief to bldr held in extortion case||Mumbai: The Supreme Court has given interim relief to a builder whom the crime branch wants to re-arrest in a case of extortion for allegedly using the services of fugitive gangster Vijay Shetty to threaten a builder over their financial dispute.The Supreme Court was hearing a special leave petition filed by Hemant Banker (71), a Worli resident, who was arrested along with one Anand Shetty by the Anti Extortion cell last August. Banker was subsequently released on bail. The police later invoked the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organized Crime Act (MCOCA) because of the involvement of Shetty and sought his custodial interrogation.Shetty is a former member of Chhota Rajan gang who along with deported gangster Santosh Shetty had helped Rajan escape from the Bangkok hospital after he was shot at by the Dawood gang in 2000. Senior Advocates Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Mukul Rohatgi appeared on behalf of Banker and argued that the case does not attract the stringent provisions of MCOCA.Banker had earlier moved a quashing petition in the Bombay High Court stating that the FIR against him was wrongly registered and that he had been framed in the case by Agarwal. The Bombay High Court rejected the petition after which Banker filed a special leave petition in the Supreme Court. The SC posted the matter for hearing on February 2 but directed the State to give an undertaking that the proceedings before the MCOCA Court will be deferred until the next date after the Supreme Court hearing.The case pertains to a complaint lodged by builder Kailash Agarwal who alleged that he was receiving threats from fugitive gangster Vijay Shetty. Agarwal and Bankar who were partners had some financial dispute in Dubai and Banker was to pay a huge amount to Agarwal. Agarwal was demanding his money and Banker were allegedly avoiding him.The police case is that in a bid to delay the payments Banker had taken help from Anand Shetty. Anand Shetty in turn approached gangster Vijay Shetty and sought his help. Vijay Shetty then called up Agarwal and threatened him not to harass Banker and the payments would be delayed. Shetty also said that he would take the responsibility of Banker’s payment.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/sc-gives-interim-relief-to-bldr-held-in-extortion-case/articleshow/89066551.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Mumbai||State cites central report to show SC it has data on OBCs||Mumbai: The state government, which has been permitted by the Supreme Court to produce before a commission data which it says is relevant to ensure OBC reservations for the local body elections, had before the SC cited NSS data from a September 2021 report of the Central Ministry of Statistics and Programme implementation which said the state has 40% OBC among rural households between July 2018 and June 2019. It also cited a 2017 Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics report which said 48% people belong to the OBC community and thus as an intermediate measure an ordinance had prescribed 27% OBC seats.The state had approached the SC to recall its December 15 order to re-notify the 27% OBC quota for the local body polls and conduct polls for corresponding number of seats as open category instead of OBC.The state submitted that elections to 34 zilla parishads out of 37 and 313 panchayat samities out of 351 as well as 9,000 village panchayats are due by March 2022 and if the quota is not permitted it would mean for next five years the constitutional mandate for proportionate representation would not be implemented.The Maharashtra application said: “As per Census 2011 the raw data is available with the central government but the Centre is withholding the data.” It said that there are more than 342 castes under OBC and the list is different at the central and state level.  The SC had last year stayed the election to OBC quota as it said its earlier orders required a mandatory “triple test” to determine backwardness.The state petition through advocates Rahul Chitnis and Sachin Patil said its quota is “pursuant to Mandal Commission Report”. It said it has complied with two of three tests laid down by the SC in its 2010 judgment in Dr K Krishna Murthy v Union of India for OBC quota and only the compiling of empirical data of such population in local bodies — the third test — remains, for which it has data. The SC bench headed by Justice A M Khanwilkar in its order said: “Instead of examining the correctness of the data furnished by the State, the appropriate course for the State is to produce this data and further information as may be available before the State appointed dedicated Commission, who, in turn, can examine the correctness thereof and if deem it appropriate, to make recommendation to the State on the basis of which further steps can be taken ... .”The SC directed that the backward class commission headed by retired Justice A V Nirgude may submit interim report in two weeks after state sends the data.The state is relying on ‘Saral portal’ and figures of students not registered on the portal, which shows 17% are students of OBC, 11% are from VJNT, 1% from SBC and under 1% from Social and Educationally Backward Class. There are thus over 30% students from reserved category.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/state-cites-central-report-to-show-sc-it-has-data-on-obcs/articleshow/89066552.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Mumbai||Green activist detained by Mumbai cops for objecting to felling of 60-year-old tree||MUMBAI: Activist Abhay Bavishi of the Save Aarey citizens’ group was forcibly detained by the authorities for raising questions when a huge peepal tree was hacked in the gaothan area of Vile Parle (east) on Saturday. The heritage tree, which is said to be at least 60 years old, was fully chopped by the K-East ward officials of BMC, although the tree-cutting order is reportedly dated from the year 2018. Speaking to TOI after being released from detention, Bavishi said: “I had gone to the site today after hearing that the big peepal tree was about to be fully cut by the K-East ward officials. The municipal gardens official, Pradeep Jadhav, had showed me the tree cutting order which was dated from 2018. I tried to reason with the civic officials that I had been writing to the BMC since 2017-18 to not cut this particular tree. Green activists have also filed RTI applications to find out why a heritage tree in the gaothan area in Vile Parle (east) had to be destroyed.” Bavishi further added: “Police told me to go to the ward office to complain. However, I reasoned that by the time I could do this, this grand old tree would have been hacked to death. That is when the cops forcibly pushed me inside their vehicle, while this tree was cut.” Activists have now written to the BMC, as well as state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray about the allegedly illegal tree cutting. “This looks like an illegal tree cutting because the order to cut it is dated 2018. What was the need to hack it now, after nearly four years, when the tree was not coming in the way of anything? It looks like some builder lobby wanted to get rid of this heritage tree in order to develop the gaothan area. It is tragic that this big peepal tree could not be saved,” said activist Zoru Bathena. While the assistant commissioner of K-East ward, Prashant Sapkale, was unavailable for comment, the civic garden official, Pradeep Jadhav, said: “I cannot comment on this subject to the media. You can contact the ward office in this regard.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/green-activist-detained-by-cops-for-objecting-to-felling-of-60-yr-old-tree/articleshow/89066553.cms||---

The officers initiated coordinated action at different locations in Thane, Bhiwandi, Raigad and Mumbai. The officials carried out searches at Bhiwandi based business premises of Adarsh Scrap Traders along with other 24 fake entities. The initial investigation showed that the firm had fraudulently claimed and passed on Input Tax Credit (ITC) of Rs 11.4 crore without actual supply or receipt of goods. The proprietor of the firm, confessed to the bogus billing and was arrested on Friday and has been remanded to 14 days judicial custody. The roots of this network are spread across Nagpur, Pune, Delhi and Nasik, said commissioner of GST Sumit Kumar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/one-arrested-in-fake-tax-racket-with-bogus-billing-of-63cr/articleshow/89066554.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Rs 3 lakh payout for trucker who died after driving non-stop for 18 days||MUMBAI: Nearly two decades after a 54-year-old truck driver died on the job due to heart disease, his family was granted relief with the Bombay high court directing the employer and insurance firm to pay Rs 3 lakh, along with interest. The court made note of the “stress and strain associated with long distance driving for almost 18 days”.  While the employer said the death was not due to work pressure, the court observed that the truck had left Mumbai for Ranchi 17-18 days prior to the death. The driver was headed back to Mumbai when the incident occurred. “The distance covered was around 1,800km. There was no second or spare driver. These circumstances deserve adequate consideration,’’ said the HC, noting the “enormity of the situation which a driver faces on account of long and arduous journey for almost 18 days, uninterrupted.’’ The post mortem report had termed it as a natural death due to coronary artery heart disease. The high court judgment said, “The long distance driving for about 3,600km can be expected to generate stress and strain, even subconsciously.’’ The HC allowed an appeal filed by the driver’s widow Harvinder Kaur and other family members. The court directed the employer and insurer, New Indian Assurance Company Ltd to jointly and severally pay out a compensation of almost Rs 3 lakh with 12 per cent interest per annum since December 2003. The HC also directed the employer to pay Rs 25,000 as a penalty. The appeal was against a April 2007 judgment passed by the commissioner for workmen’s compensation and judge, 8th labour court at Mumbai, dismissing an application for compensation for a 2003 death of a person arising from his employment, while driving a truck owned by the employer and insured by the insurance company. The HC judgment said that the commissioner misdirected herself in taking a hyper-technical view of the matter and lost sight of the beneficial object of the Employees’ Compensation Act. The application had said the driver died due to “stress and strain of employment’’ as he had been driving the truck continuously for almost 18 days. Thus, the application claimed compensation of Rs 4 lakh with interest and penalty. The owner admitted he was paying Rs 4,000 as monthly wages and a claim form was submitted to the insurer. The insurer opposed the claim, saying the death was “natural’’ and not due to the use of the vehicle nor an accident out of employment, hence the contingencies in their insurance contract and section 147 of the Motor Vehicles Act, which speaks of third party, was not made out.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/3-lakh-payout-for-trucker-who-died-after-driving-non-stop-for-18-days/articleshow/89066555.cms||Swati Deshpande

---||Mumbai||Short circuit is cause of most fires in Mumbai, shows data||MUMBAI: Fire brigade officials said Saturday’s fire at Tardeo’s Sachinam Heights was most likely caused by a short circuit in the electrical duct, and it spread since the firefighting equipment was not functional. Short circuits and non-functional firefighting systems have become a deadly combination for fires in the city, especially in high-rises in the recent past.  A majority of fires breaking out in Mumbai have been due to short circuits and casualties have been high as firefighting systems remain non-functional. According to data received by activist Shakeel Ahmed Shaikh under the RTI Act, 57,540 fires have broken out in Mumbai between 2008 and 2020. In 2020, a total of 3,841 fire accidents killed 33 people and injured 99. 1,568 fires have been reported in high-rises between 2008 and 2018. Data also shows the cause of most fires is short circuits, followed by gas cylinder leaks or blasts; also, more fires have broken out in residential buildings than commercial buildings (8,737 as against 3,833 in commercial buildings). A total of 680 people have died in the fires, 247 of them men, 248 women and 29 children. Property worth over Rs 90 crore was damaged in the fires in 12 years. There were reports of 3,151 fires in slums. The cause of 32,516 fires was short circuits. And 1,116 fires broke out due to gas cylinder leakage and 11,889 due to other reasons. In November last year, the fire at Currey Road’s One Avighna Park was caused by a short circuit in the electronic video door bell of the apartment and spread rapidly into the flat due to the wooden empanelment on the walls, the fire brigade’s preliminary investigation had revealed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/short-circuit-is-cause-of-most-fires-shows-data/articleshow/89066561.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

I opened the door and there was a lot of smoke. We decided to close the door and wait inside the house. We stood on the side, near the wall and prayed for safety,” said Gunaji, who was home with three other relatives. When the smoke subsided, they climbed down the staircase on the instructions of the fire-brigade. “My nephew Swapnil felt short of breath because of the smoke and had to be hospitalized,” he said. Friends of the Kantharia family had also gathered outside Nair Hospital, where Manjuben Kantharia who was in her 70’s was declared dead. Her son Kirit Kantharia has not been traced and one body at Nair Hospital is still unidentified. The family is frantically searching for him but the police strongly suspect the unidentified body is that of Kirit.“I lost my grandmother and my uncle is missing. My family members are totally blank. We don’t know what is happening,” said Manjuben’s grandson. Manjuben and Kirit Kantharia lived on the 19th floor and had moved there just a few years ago. “We had grown up around them. Manjuben was like a mother to me. We used to eat at each other’s homes. She was very kind and loving,” said Sanjay More, a childhood friend of Kirit Kantharia.Rajesh Balla mourned his friend Hitesh Mistry (40) who died in the blaze along with his mother Meena Mistry (65) and sister Mausmi Mistry (45). They lived in flat 1904 “We had grown up playing cricket together. He was a lot of fun and had many friends. We met for dinner just a few nights ago. I can’t believe he is no more,” said Balla.

If it is true then, BMC & State administration should fix the responsibility for these deaths and take action against those responsible,” he tweeted. A resident of Sachinam Heights said initially, a hospital nearby had refused to admit a patient but later began taking in patients. 29 victims were rushed to Kasturba, Bhatia, Nair, Wockhardt, Masina and HN Reliance Hospitals. Mayor Kishori Pednekar, who visited the site, said the BMC would take action if any hospital had refused admission. BMC officials said their health department had coordinated with all local hospitals and ensured all patients were not just admitted but received timely treatment. - TNN||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/fadnavis-says-some-private-hosps-refused-to-admit-victims/articleshow/89066563.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai highrise fire: Building’s firefighting system didn’t work, audit report wasn’t submitted||Mumbai: While one of the victims of the Tardeo tower fire had not been identified, the five other dead were identified as Hitesh Subodh Mistry (40), Mausmi Subodh Mistry (45) and Meena Subodh Mistry (65), who stayed in Flat No. 1904, Purshottam Chopdekar (42), who stayed on the 16th floor, and Manjuben Kantharia, another 19th floor resident. Of the 24 injured, 17 people were still admitted in hospitals at the time of going to press and 7 had been discharged. The fire is suspected to have spread through the electrical duct right through the length of the building, resulting in thick smoke all over. Flat No 1904, where the fire burst out, was gutted, along with parts of corridors on the 19th floor. While the building, which is the rehabilitation component of a redevelopment project being carried out by Kamala Group, received an Occupation Certificate in 2015, fire brigade officials said its firefighting equipment was not functional, nor had the building submitted the mandatory bi-annual fire audit report. The sale component is still under construction. “Fire gutted flat 1904 completely and damaged the common passageway. The firefighting system was not working. The building had not submitted reports of its bi-annual fire safety audit to the fire brigade. The fire brigade is investigating. The last fire mock drill was conducted four years ago. Firemen approached the floor using the staircase and first rescued 28-29 people. None of the people were found in refuge areas. But the entire building was smoke-logged due to a common duct with electric cables running along the length of the building,” said chief fire officer Hemant Parab. An official said, “13 fire engines and 7 water jetties were rushed to douse the fire... The blaze was extinguished by 12.20 pm. There are eight flats on each floor of the building. The blaze engulfed the 19th floor and some occupants got trapped. Most residents ran down using the staircase.” The BMC has ordered a probe. “A committee headed by deputy municipal commissioner Harshad Kale will conduct the inquiry and submit the report within 15 days... The committee will examine the cause of fire in consultation with the CFO, the reasons for the spread of fire... and any illegal addition/alteration... beyond approved plans,” the BMC said. Gamdevi police registered an accidental death report and said they were awaiting the fire brigade’s findings. “If we come across evidence of negligence, we will book those responsible,” said an officer. PM Modi said ex-gratia of Rs 2 lakh would be provided to family of each of the deceased from the PM’s National Relief Fund. The injured would be given Rs 50,000 each. State tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray said the government will provide compensation of Rs 5 lakh to family of each of the deceased. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi urged party workers to help those affected.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/buildings-firefighting-system-didnt-work-audit-report-wasnt-submitted/articleshow/89066565.cms||Ahmed Ali

---||Thane||Covid-19: 10 Maharashtra districts top state's average in weekly positivity rate||MUMBAI: There are 10 districts in the state that have a weekly positivity rate (WPR) higher than the state average of 24%. These districts are those where Covid-19 cases are surging and the list does not include Mumbai. Topping the charts is Nashik district, which reported a WPR of nearly 39% for the week that ended on January 19. Pune followed with a WPR of 38.5% and Raigad reported a WPR of 31%. In contrast, Mumbai, where the third wave is ebbing, had a WPR of 18.5%, lower than Dhule and Nandurbar. The WPR takes into account the total number of tests carried out in a week and the positive cases detected in those. State surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate said the Omicron-Covid wave in Mumbai and the neighbouring districts, such as Thane and Palghar, is already declining, but other districts are showing a rise. The daily caseload in seven days has galloped to over 18,000 in Pune and over 6,000 in Nagpur. “If the wave in these districts is similar to the Mumbai wave, which rose and plateaued quickly, then we should see a decline in most districts of Maharashtra within the next week or two,” said Dr Awate. Health minister Rajesh Tope said the districts which have a higher positivity rate than the state average have been asked to ramp up testing and ensure that people getting treated in home quarantine are monitored regularly. A doctor said that almost 33% of the state population is already infected with the virus and another 33% is exposed. “In the rest of the month, the remaining 33% will also get exposed to Omicron. The Omicron wave should be over by February-end in Maharashtra,” he said. The state health department’s experts believe that the Omicron-Covid wave has not only been mild, but has not needed any specific treatment or oxygen support for people. “This wave has been so mild that if there was no surveillance due to the pandemic, we would not have noticed it at all. Over 80% of the patients are asymptomatic or suffer from cold-like symptoms,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thane/10-dists-top-state-average-in-weekly-positivity-rate/articleshow/89067943.cms||---

The Maharashtra Coaching Class Owners Association (MCOA) has written to the chief minister regarding restarting offline classes. “The fresh circular on reopening educational institutions issued by the state on Thursday is silent about coaching classes,” said MCOA president Santosh Vaskar.Vaskar said that since the Covid-19 outbreak in March 2020, over 20% of the 98,000 big and small coaching classes in the state have shut down. He said that an equal number are on the verge of closing down. In Mumbai there are around 36,000 coaching classes, all of which have seen a drop in enrolment. “Enrolment further reduced this year, as many thought it will be an exam-free year again,” said Vaskar.With class 10 and 12 board exams beginning in March-April, coaching classes want to conduct practice tests offline tests for students.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/tuition-centres-await-states-nod-to-resume-offline-classes/articleshow/89066569.cms||Sandhya Nair

The hosts, who need to improve their finishing skills, must now beat Chinese Taipei to boost their chances of making the quarterfinals of the tournament from Group A. Similarly, Chinese Taipei, who succumbed to a 4-0 defeat against China in their first game, too will be eyeing their first win of the competition.India head coach Thomas Dennerby, who was “disappointed” not to have taken full points against Iran, believes that his team would hit top gear in offense with “a few tweaks.’ “I think we have a solid defence. We defended well (against Iran) whenever they tried to counter-attack. A few tweaks to our attack, and we will be ready for our next opponents,” said the 62-year-old Swede. “My philosophy is to learn the lesson and look ahead. It’s always good to come up with points in your first game, you stand a better chance of moving to the next round. We need to follow our plan against Chinese Taipei.“That game (Iran) is over. The result is what it is. We can never look back. Now we have to work on our finishing and go at it again in the second match and get the three points. The only thing we can do is focus on our opponents and not the table. Chinese Taipei lost to China PR but they are a good team and we must play well against them,” said Dennerby.Presently, eight-time champions China are topping group A, while India are placed at the second spot.Chinese Taipei head coach Kazuo Echigo believes that his players will be fired up as they have a score to settle against India on Sunday. Chinese Taipei lost 1-0 to India last October. “This is a very tough competition. Everybody gave their best efforts throughout the game (against China PR),” said Echigo.“The players need to recover after the tough game against China but they will be motivated for the India tie. We lost to them in October and the team wants to avenge that defeat,” Echigo said.With the top two teams supposed to advance automatically to the quarterfinals, neither side can afford to drop points — setting up the stage for a spicy battle.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/indian-women-eye-first-win-take-on-taipei-in-2nd-game/articleshow/89066571.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Covid technical advisory committee bats for home isolation of positive international passengers||BENGALURU: The state Covid technical advisory committee recommended that the government allow home isolation of international travellers who turn Covid-positive on arrival, if they are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. Currently, Covid-positive international travellers are to be in institutional isolation at hotels, monitored by private hospitals or government-run Covid care centres if they have mild or no symptoms. After Omicron concerns, from December 2021 onwards, Karnataka had mandated admission to designated hospitals if flyers from high-risk countries tested positive on arrival. They were discharged only after testing negative in two consecutive RTPCR tests done 24 hours apart. But from January 6, the government allowed institutional isolation at hotels monitored by hospitals or at CCCs. The stay was reduced from 10 to 7 days. TAC sources said for the last one month, they noticed most passengers testing positive were either having mild or no symptoms and did not need hospitalisation. “It is recommended these passengers – based on assessment at the designated clinical facility — may be retained at the facility/hospital for management or transferred to institutional or home isolation after reporting to the district surveillance officer,” the TAC report said. Covishield booster dose for those jabbed abroadSenior citizens who got first and second doses abroad and are currently in Karnataka can take Covishield as their precautionary booster dose, TAC said. “Those who took two doses of Moderna or Pfizer or one dose of J&J vaccine abroad, can take Covishield as their booster dose, provided their primary vaccine is unavailable here,” said TAC members. 42k cases reportedThe state reported 42,470 Covid cases on Saturday. While Bengaluru recorded a dip and logged 17,266, rest of Karnataka saw a spike, with Mysuru adding 4,601, Tumakuru 3,417 and Hassan 2,679. The state’s daily positivity rate was 19.3% and Bengaluru’s 15.4%. A total of 26 deaths were reported. Nearly 2.2 lakh tests were conducted in Karnataka and 1.1 lakh in Bengaluru in 24 hours.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/committee-bats-for-home-isolation-of-ve-intl-passengers/articleshow/89066572.cms||Sunitha Rao R

In the third wave, 5% of the infected persons have required admission so far, shows an analysis by the health and family welfare department. The highest number of active cases during the second wave was recorded on May 15, 2021 (over 6 lakh) and during the first wave on October 10, 2020 (1.2 lakh). In the third wave, the state has seen 2.9 lakh active cases as on January 21. A total of 25,992 Covid patients died during the second wave; the first claimed 12,331 lives. In the third, 204 fatalities have been recorded till now, as per data released by the government on Saturday. While the highest single-day case count in the first wave was 9,047 (reported on October 7, 2020), it jumped to 50,112 on May 5, 2021 during the second wave. In the third wave, the maximum daily cases (47,754) were seen on January 20.

According to Dr MK Sudarshan, chairperson, Covid technical advisory committee, the third wave is driven by the Omicron strain, based on clinico-epidemiological evidence. “Based on the doubling rate, symptoms seen and most cases being asymptomatic, it’s evident that Omicron is driving the third wave, which distinguishes it from the second,” he said. He added the current clinical scenario suggests the viral infection involves upper respiratory system, nose and throat. In the third wave, there is very little involvement of lungs, as a result of which there is minimal hospitalisation, but crowding in OPDs. There is not much demand for oxygen and antiviral drug remdesivir, and a few deaths, he added. Read AlsoIs the pandemic ending?

While in the first, curbs like lockdown were required as the disease was new and had created apprehensions globally, in the second wave, there was gradual rise in hospitalisation, oxygen requirement and deaths. The third wave has not been lethal like the Delta-driven second wave. “Weekly test positivity rate alone is a wrong indicator in the Omicron wave to impose curbs. A weekly TPR of 10% and above along with 40% hospitalisation should be considered to bring in any curbs,” said Dr Sudarshan.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/ktaka-saw-21-hospitalisation-during-second-wave-5-in-third/articleshow/89066573.cms||Sunitha Rao R
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru to get 1,500 electric buses under central scheme||BENGALURU: If all goes to plan, Bengaluru will get 1,500 electric buses under the Centre’s ‘Grand Challenge’ plan. Convergence Energy Services Ltd (CESL), a PSU under the Union ministry of power, recently unveiled a tender worth Rs 5,500 crore to induct 5,580 e-buses (5,450 single-decker and 130 double-decker ones) across the country. Bengaluru is expected to get 1,500 e-buses under the scheme. While Kolkata will get the maximum number of e-buses (2,000), Delhi will also get 1,500, while Hyderabad and Surat will get 300 and Surat 150, respectively. The grand challenge was open to nine cities (with a population of more than 4 million) but only these five got into the final list. CESL officials said the cities will have to induct e-buses between July 2022 and March 2024. “This will help reduce the operating costs for cities and remove bottlenecks in procuring e-buses by state transport undertakings,” said a CESL official. However, BMTC officials are more keen on purchasing e-buses. BMTC managing director V Anbu Kumar told TOI: “We are planning to induct 1,500 12m non-AC low-floor buses in the next three years. We want to purchase these buses instead of having a lease model. We have better, experienced drivers and staff than private firms. We are in discussions with CESL on this.” He added that there is no demand for AC buses after Covid-19. The Centre’s subsidy component is around Rs 55 lakh per bus, but the state government has not committed on the subsidy part so far. With 1,500 e-buses, BMTC will have a total of 1,890 battery-run buses. The remaining 390 e-buses are 90 mini-electric buses (9m long) and 300 electric buses (12m long). Of the 90 mini-electric buses being inducted from NTPC-JBM under the Bengaluru Smart City funds, 60 have already reached the city. “The remaining 30 will arrive from JBM Auto’s plant from Kosi Kalan, near Mathura in Uttar Pradesh, by the end of this month,” a senior BMTC official said. NTPC-JBM will operate these buses for 10 years on a gross cost contract (GCC) model at a rate of Rs 51.67 per km with electricity assured for 180km daily. However, all 90 e-buses will be operational only by the end of February. “We had plans to set up charging infrastructure at three depots: Kengeri, Yeshwantpur, and KR Puram. The charging station at Kengeri is ready and installation is progressing at Yeshwantpur. All 90 e-buses will be deployed on Metro feeder routes once all charging stations are ready,” an official said. Separately, BMTC recently issued a work order to Ashok Leyland to provide 300 e-buses under the Centre’s Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles (FAME) in India II scheme. These buses will also arrive in Bengaluru in the next six months. The first prototype of the bus will come by March. Switch Mobility, the electric vehicle arm of Ashok Leyland, will run these buses at Rs 48.95pkm for 12 years. The 12m e-buses inducted under FAME II will have a seating capacity of 41. Greener, cheaper optionExperts say induction of e-buses is likely to reduce environmental pollution and operational costs given the soaring diesel prices. Under the GCC or lease model, BMTC will pay private firms on a per-km basis. The firms will deploy a driver and take care of the fleet’s operations and maintenance. However, BMTC will deploy the conductor and the fare will be the same as that aboard diesel non-AC buses. BMTC has decided to replace its scrapped buses with e-buses. “We are scrapping an average of 400 buses a year. We are planning to induct 600 e-buses a year and 30-40% passengers will use them,” an official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/city-to-get-1500-electric-buses-under-central-scheme/articleshow/89066574.cms||Christin Mathew Philip
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Some panels draw up plans as deadline to spend Rs 60 lakh nears||BENGALURU: With the March deadline for utilisation of Rs 60 lakh allocated for each of the 198 ward development committees nearing, citizen-led groups are rushing to submit development proposals aimed at giving a facelift to their respective wards. The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) had in August last year set a precedent by setting aside Rs 120 crore for ward committees after over 9,000 citizens submitted inputs for the #MyCityMyBudget campaign on how ward budgets needed to be spent. “After we received citizen budget inputs, we wanted to incentivise residents to participate in their ward affairs by giving them a chance to decide,” said BBMP special commissioner (finance) Thulasi Maddineni, while participating in a webinar titled MyCityMyBudget Phase – 2 organised by Janaagraha on Saturday. She said: “Allotting Rs 60 lakh to each of the ward committees was an act of faith in our citizens.” The amount is split into Rs 20 lakh each under three categories — footpaths, potholes and borewells. “Citizens can submit their inputs at the ward committees, which will help us decide where work needs to be taken up and where to use the funds,” she added. The money is supposed to be utilised by the end of March. While a majority of the wards are yet to see the committees swing into action, there are some that have drawn up development plans.  Sharing their views, Amith Nigli and Christopher Cruz from Banaswadi (ward 17) explained how they formulated plans to identify vulnerable roads. Swarupa Kakumanu and Poongothai from Gottigere (ward 194) said they made use of the walkability index prepared by Janaagraha to identify footpaths and roads that needed most attention. Jagadish Reddy, a member of Varthur ward committee said: “We are still planning with the committee on how to utilise these funds rightly. During the walkability index process, the survey revealed there is not a single footpath in and around Varthur which is usable and thus we decided to work on it.” Joining him, Lalitha Mohan of Radhakrishna Temple (ward 18) said: “We zeroed in on two factors with regard to footpaths — proximity to neighbourhood schools and the connecting roads.” Srinivas Alavilli, head, civic participation, Janaagraha, said it is very important to use this opportunity and prove what citizen groups can do. “We are educating people and communities about the need for ward committees. We urge more citizens to get involved locally and taste the power of community engagement and ownership,” Alavilli said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/some-panels-draw-up-plans-as-deadline-to-spend-60l-nears/articleshow/89066575.cms||---

The accused is of Devinagar in Pradeep V of Vidyaranyapura. He works as a boarding executive with an online company. The victim filed a police complaint on December 21 last year saying the accused had taken a loan of Rs 40,000 by using his documents and mobile phone. Later, Rs 9,000 was transferred from his account to another unknown one. “In October, the man approached me saying he worked for an online company and needed a place to store goods and materials. A shop next to my office was vacant and I agreed to rent it out to him. After initial talks, he asked for my documents, including registration certificate, Aadhaar and PAN cards. After taking them, he asked for my mobile phone, saying he would install an app where the rent could be deposited directly every month. As I watched, he entered the details of my documents. Following this, he left saying he would come with the goods another day,” the businessman told police. However, in December, he was shocked to receive notices from a private financial institution saying he had not paid monthly instalment on a loan. “I realised the man had conned me.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/youth-dupes-bizman-using-app-arrested/articleshow/89066576.cms||---

This is to ensure that passengers, who get off before the final destination, take only their luggage and not that of others. There have been increasing complaints of passengers losing valuables from buses, especially at night. “There have been some theft cases, especially on the Bengaluru-Chennai route, in the past few years. Some unreserved passengers get into the bus with laptop bags containing newspapers and buy a ticket from the conductor. They sit near passengers working on their laptop during the journey. At night, the thieves steal the laptops when the passengers are sleeping and place their laptop bags with newspapers there. They deboard when the bus stops midway,” said a KSRTC official. “We’ve asked conductors to alert passengers carrying laptops so that they are careful and take precautions. We’ve also told conductors to keep an eye on unreserved passengers entering buses with laptop bags,” he said. KSRTC recently instructed its crew on long-distance buses to take care of passengers’ luggage. However, some conductors said they are already overburdened with work and cannot be held responsible for missing/stolen luggage.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/ksrtc-conductors-told-to-keep-eye-on-luggage/articleshow/89066577.cms||---

We’ll also seek their suggestions. In matters of the state interest, all parties have shown unity and cooperation with the government,” Bommai said. He said another meeting with senior counsels representing the state in the water disputes will be convened. 'Will oppose TN’s Hogenakkal project'To a query, the CM said the state will oppose the Hogenakkal-2 project proposed by the Tamil Nadu government. “We’ve already registered our protest against the TN’s river-linking project in Cauvery basin and we’ll also oppose the Hogenakkal project both politically and legally,” he said. Water resources minister Govind Karjol said the legal team will move an application before the Supreme Court registrar on Monday for reconstitution of the bench hearing Karnataka's petition seeking gazette notification of the award of the Krishna Water Dispute Tribunal. On January 10, justices DY Chandrachud and AS Bopanna recused themselves from the hearing to avoid a conflict of interest as they are from Maharashtra and Karnataka, the parties in the case. Karjol said the hearing on the Mahadayi dispute in the Supreme Court is in its final stages and the state legal team will try to get the verdict at the earliest. The case pertaining to Mekedatu drinking water project is also coming up for hearing on February 16. Before that, the CM will hold another meeting with the legal team, he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/all-party-meet-in-feb-to-discuss-inter-state-water-disputes-cm/articleshow/89066578.cms||Vasantha Kumar

Setting aside the August 10, 2021, order passed by 5th additional district and sessions judge, Dakshina Kannada, justice HP Sandesh also ordered police to take the lecturer back into custody. The girl’s mother had challenged the bail order. In his defence, the lecturer contended that the alleged offence had taken place in 2018 and it was disclosed after two and a half years with no explanation given for the delay.He also claimed the girl herself had explained her family situation and written to him about it, and those documents were placed before and considered by the trial court. He said the trial court had observed that the complainant, investigating officer and even the special public prosecutor had ample opportunity to seek cancellation of bail in the event of collection of incriminating material or violation of bail conditions. However, allowing the petition filed by the girl’s mother, Justice Sandesh said the trial court had hurriedly passed the bail order by unnecessarily looking into the evidence available on record. The judge pointed out that the lecturer had allegedly called the girl, aged a little over 14, and subjected her to a sexual act in October 2018 with the help of his wife. He had also allegedly taken photos, blackmailed the girl and collected Rs 10,000. Justice Sandesh said as per law, before granting bai,l the trial court should’ve heard the complainant/informant/victim in such a case.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/hc-finds-fault-with-court-approach-cancels-bail/articleshow/89066579.cms||Vasantha Kumar

However, Byadarahallli police cracked the case in less than 24 hours, rescuing the victim from Andhra Pradesh and arresting six abductors. The victim, M Venkatesh, is a private bus driver and lives with his family in Andrahalli. His sister Navya (name changed) had distanced herself from her live-in partner Srinivas alias Bottu Seena, 40, of Rajagopalnagar, an auto driver. Srinivas was upset over this. On Thursday night, Venkatesh was walking home when the six men bundled him into a Maruti Swift and drove to Palamaner in Andhra Pradesh, around 140km from the city. Subjecting Venkatesh to physical torture, the miscreants made him call Navya. Venkatesh pleaded with Navya to call Srinivas immediately and tell him she would return to him. In mid-2021, Navya, a mother of two minors, left her husband’s house and started living with Srinivas. However, their relationship ended by November and Navya went on to live with her parents in Andrahalli. But Srinivas wanted Navya to get back to him and started calling her regularly. Navya refused and blocked his number. Srinivas made attempts to meet her by visiting her parents’ house, but was shown the door. Angered, he decided to kidnap Venkatesh so Navya would return to him. He managed to execute the plan the help of five of his friends. While Srinivas and two of his associates held Venkatesh in the car, the other three abductors followed on two motorbikes. Following Venkatesh’s call, Navya filed a police complaint. A special team led by deputy commissioner of police (west) Sanjeev M Patil and assistant commissioner of police (Vijayanagar) K Nanjunde Gowda traced the miscreants and the victim to Palamaner. “Dressed as locals, we reached Palamaner in private cars and identified the abductors’ vehicle that was parked at a desolate place. A team of 12 cops rescued the victim,” a police officer said. The arrested accomplices are Pratap, Akash, Huchhe Gowda, Shiva, and Gangadar, who all drive cabs and autos.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/jilted-lover-kidnaps-womans-brother/articleshow/89066581.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Debt-ridden engineer robs bank, lands in police net||BENGALURU: Having lost around Rs 35 lakh by trading on online platforms and falling into a debt trap, a 28-year-old mechanical engineer decided to rob a bank to make a quick buck. He succeeded in his mission on January 14 when he walked away with 1.8kg of gold and Rs 3.7 lakh cash from a bank in Madiwala after threatening the staff with a knife. But he ran out of luck as cops tracked him down and arrested him along with the stolen booty. The accused is Dheeraj S, a resident of Kamakshipalya and employee of a private company. Police said he used to earn Rs 30,000 a month and stayed with his brother and father. He started investing his savings in an app-based trading platform in November 2020 and soon was borrowing from several people, including his family members, to pump in more money. But the investments fell flat and he pushed himself into a debt trap. That is when he came up with the idea of robbing a bank, police said. He started searching on the internet how to execute bank robberies. But he only came across robberies done by gangs and how some of them were busted. “He thought committing robbery without an accomplice would help him avoid the police dragnet,” an officer said. Dheeraj decided to rob a bank that was a fair distance away from his residence. In December last year, he roamed all over south Bengaluru, including Jayanagar, JP Nagar and surrounding areas, before zeroing in on a bank located on Hosur Main Road in Madiwala. The bank was close to the main road and had no security guard. Dheeraj visited the bank at least four times in the first and second weeks of January and made mental notes of the manager’s chamber, strongroom and more. 20-minute robbery On January 14, he arrived near the bank by 4pm and went upstairs, where there are a few shops. He came down around 5.30pm when bank manager N Harish, 38, and the cashier were locking up the main door. Dheeraj pulled out a knife and threatened the manager and the woman with dire consequences if they did not open the door. Frightened, the manager let him in. Knowing where the strongroom was, Dheeraj directed them towards it and told them to open the safe. As the two watched helplessly, he collected cash and gold from the safe. He then hurriedly left the bank and boarded an autorickshaw. The entire robbery took place in a span of about 20 minutes, between 5.40pm and 6pm. “CCTV footage helped us track Dheeraj. From the bank, he travelled to Banashankari bus terminal and from there to the KSRTC terminal at Majestic. There, he boarded a bus headed towards Chikkamagaluru. In Chikkamagaluru, he disposed of a small portion of the gold. He boarded a bus to Tarikere and travelled to Shivamogga. After disposing of another portion of the gold, he returned to Bengaluru and boarded a bus to Anantapur in Andhra Pradesh. He sold a portion of the gold there before returning to the city,” an investigating officer said. “He repaid loans taken from six friends and was trying to sell gold to repay the seventh when we caught him.” Watch Watch how this debt-ridden 28-year-old mechanical engineer robs bank in Bengaluru||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/debt-ridden-engineer-robs-bank-lands-in-police-net/articleshow/89066583.cms||---

The Blues, who resumed training a few days back after nearly 10 days in isolation following a number of positive Covid cases, may not be in the best shape to take on Goa but coach Pezzaiuoli is confident of a fighting show.“We returned to training two days ago and it has been good because the boys were eager to go out and be able to kick a ball. Our boys have been going through a lot, injuries, personal problems and the like, but we are enjoying our football, which is important. Our team changes because of the quarantine, which is also not ideal but we are doing our best and the club has been very professional in the way it has gone about putting the health of boys ahead of everything else,” Pezzaiuoli said on the eve of the match, while also adding that one of his players tested positive on Friday. BFC are on a five-game unbeaten streak. Their last defeat came against Goa while their most recent fixture against ATK Mohun Bagan was postponed, owing to Covid-19 outbreak in the camp. The Gaurs, who have played a match more,will look to bounce back from a narrow defeat against SC East Bengal. A win will be crucial for the play-off ambitions of both teams and the BFC coach rated his opponents highly. “I believe FC Goa are the best team when it comes to possession of the ball. They try to play offensive football, and have a good mix of foreign and Indian players. We will be up for the challenge.” Result: Chennaiyin FC 2 (Borysiuk 52, Koman 58) bt NorthEast United FC 1 (Danmawia 35). Today's matches: Bengaluru FC vs FC Goa (7.30 pm); ATK Mohun Bagan vs Odisha FC (9.30 pm Live on Star Sports).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/bluru-face-goa-after-12-day-break/articleshow/89066584.cms||---

It shall be done to assess quantum of minerals mined by licenced miners to determine the royalty payable to the state. Justice S M Subramaniam passed the order while rejecting a batch of pleas moved by Coimbatore-based Associated Cement Companies Limited (ACC) challenging notices issued by the state demanding payment of royalty for minerals . The company challenged the decision of the government to calculate the royalty on the consumption factor without surveying the actual mining fields. Pointing out that the company was evading the notices for 19 years by obtaining an interim order, the judge said, “Illegalities under the cover of legality is the modern invention of few super brains .” No doubt that industrial development must be protected, at the same time the nation’s wealth and public interest must also be protected, the judge added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/adopt-drone-survey-of-mining-sites-state-told/articleshow/89066586.cms||---

Disability certificates are mandatory to get compensation from the motor vehicle accidents claims tribunal. The courts award compensation to victims only based on the percentage of disability. So far, the victims were compelled to sleep on the floors of the casuality ward in RGGGH due to lack of space. The hospital has created a separate ward in compliance of an order passed by the Madras high court. Justice Krishnan Ramasamy directed the hospital to create the ward on a plea by C Jagadeesan, a road accident survivor. Recording the sufferings underwent by the petitioner to get the certificate, the court said: “Though the prayer sought for by the petitioner in a slighter way, appears to be a pro bono publico, considering the good intention of the petitioner that the sufferings faced by him should not be continued for other persons this court is inclined to entertain this plea.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/get-disability-cert-via-exclusive-ward/articleshow/89066588.cms||---

The government order issued in this regard does not bar re-donation of cows or any cattle donated to temples, the first bench of acting Chief Justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari and Justice P D Audikesavalu said. The issue pertains to a plea moved by Rangarajan Narasimhan of Trichy. According to him, the department had issued a GO dated September 6, 2013 for regulating the donated cows given to organisations so as to avoid slaughter of cows. As per the GO, the donated cows can be re-donated only when they are milking cows and not otherwise. However, the department is now permitting re-donation of the non-milking cows also, the petitioner said. Refusing to concur, the court said, “The GO does not make a reference as to donation or re-donation of the milking cows only. Rather, it is silent on the issue as to whether it is a milking cow or non- milking cow.” As to the contention of the petitioner that a provision of the GO permits use of milk from the donated for the temple and therefore, it permits donation of milking cows only, the court said, “Merely making a reference about use of milk by the temple does not mean that the GO was only for donation or re-donation of milking cows.” Therefore, the prayer made by the petitioner cannot be accepted. The action of the authorities is in accordance with the GO, the court added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/hc-cant-stop-hrce-from-giving-away-donated-cows/articleshow/89066589.cms||---

The judicial sword has to definitely cut through the web so that water, which is the source of livelihood of the living beings, is passed on generation after generation,” Justice M Dhandapani said. With equal force, the officials, who had refrained from taking any action on such encroachment should also be dealt with in accordance with law, he added. The hight court passed the order while dismissing a plea moved by Annamalai, a resident of Tiruvallur challenging disconnection of electricity supply to his property on the ground that it was an encroachment on a water body. Appalled over the manner in which such encroachments are made, and legal colour is given to the same with the collusion of revenue officials, the court suo motu impleaded the commissioner of revenue administration and passed the order. Justice Dhandapani directed the commissioner to find out the officer who aided the encroachment and take immediate action against them. “The revenue and electricity department officials, throwing caution and vigilance to the winds, unmindful of the environmental impact created by the act of encroachment on water bodies, provide the persons, like the petitioner and his vendor with electricity connection and what not,” Justice Dhandapani said. Thereby, the future generations are deprived of storage space for water, even at times of incessant rains, but face acute water shortage during peak summer, which destabilises the life and livelihood of the persons living in the locality, Justice Dhandapani added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/hc-cracks-whip-on-squatters-tainted-babus/articleshow/89066593.cms||Suresh Kumar

The lab was reviewed by health minister Ma Subramanian and senior public health officials on Saturday, after inaugurating a mass vaccination camp on the campus. The mobile lab Parakh, built by Defence Food Research Laboratory (DFRL), Mysore, can travel to remote areas where testing facilities might not be available. This van can travel to those regions, perform sample collection, processing, and analysis in real-time, an IIT-M release said. The IIT-M biotechnology department head Guhan Jayaraman said the facility can be deployed for surveillance of any infectious diseases such as dengue, Tuberculosis (TB) and other kinds of viral outbreaks. “It is a BSL-2 lab equipped with an RT-PCR, centrifuge, refrigeration units, biosafety cabinet and other facilities. It can be further equipped with other portable devices and used for detection of other diseases and medical conditions,” he said. The long-term objective is to deploy low-cost portable diagnostic devices.

---||Chennai||Chennai: Work to begin to reduce noise during metro train travel||CHENNAI: Many commuters may have heard a screeching noise while travelling in metro trains, which is mainly caused by the train-track friction, usually on sharp curves. Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL) will soon begin maintenance of tracks where a rail grinding machine will be operated to smoothen the rails that have suffered wear and tear due to train operations and reduce noise besides extending the life of the rails. A metro rail official said the plan is to conduct maintenance across the 54km stretch from Wimco Nagar to Airport and from Central Metro to St Thomas Mount within 90 days. “We are likely to begin work in February. The work will be done after operation hours between midnight and 4.30am,” the official said. “Besides reducing noise, the grinding will improve rail-wheel contact,” the official said. Officials said the rail grinding machine, which looks similar to a diesel locomotive, is likely to be borrowed on rent from the Bangaluru metro and will be operated by a foreign expert. Recently, CMRL floated a tender to transport, load and unload the machine. The ballastless tracks suffer corrugation and at times even corrosion due to friction caused during train operations and exposure to elements. This often leads to rail squeals, a screeching noise when trains manoeuver sharp curves or on straight stretches, shakes and vibrations. Hence, the rails require periodic grinding. The first rail grinding was conducted soon after launch in 2015, later in 2019 and in 2021. “The main issue that arises from not conducting a grinding exercise is the damage the rails may cause on the train wheels due to the undulation and pit marks. The rails are hard and the train wheels are made of soft steel, which are imported from Europe and are expensive to replace if they are damaged,” an official said. With the 118.9km phase-2 taking shape, CMRL officials said the process is also underway to procure a rail grinding machine, which may cost nearly Rs50 crore and could take nearly 2.5 years for delivery.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/work-to-begin-to-reduce-noise-during-metro-train-travel/articleshow/89066600.cms||---

Greater Chennai Corporation commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi said the civic body had up to ₹45 crore allocated for the scheme and will put the money into use. The Namakku Naame scheme is carried out on a partnership basis with members of the common public or residential welfare associations (RWAs) where interested parties must at least contribute 30% of the project cost.

Apart from this, 10 projects on city beautification, nine projects on improving pavements, two on water body restoration and 13 on public toilets improvisation will also be carried out. People can come forward to take up work such as lake de-silting, setting up furniture for schools, cleaning up public tanks and contributing for hospital development,” the commissioner said. If the interested people come up with a proposal of one-third of funding, the civic body would release the remaining of the funds from its side and go for work orders. “In case somebody wants to provide 50% of the funding to carry out a project, we instantly give them work orders and the respective individuals can carry out the work,” the commissioner said.  In addition to this, the corporation is setting up 28 new parks under Singara Chennai 2.0, at an estimated cost of ₹24.43 crore, the commissioner added.

---||Chennai||Back to unsupervised online tests for university students in Tamil Nadu||CHENNAI: Universities in Tamil Nadu will return to unsupervised online exams from February 1, the higher education department decided on on Friday. This also shows that state universities are yet to come out with credible online tests despite the pandemic being on for nearly two years. The online exams can only be called written assignments as there is no monitoring or supervision, say academicians. They want proctored online exams where each student would receive a different set of questions to prevent malpractices such as mass copying. Professors want the government to come out with a mechanism for monitoring exams through apps such as Google Meet or MS Teams. They also want centralised evaluation to make it neutral. Some suggest conducting viva along with theory exams to help distinguish hard working students from others. “Downloading question papers and writing answers in pen and paper mode at home and sending photos or posting answer sheets is not an online exam. Online exams should be conducted without pen and paper,” said E Balagurusamy, former vice-chancellor of Anna University. Only Anna University conducted a proctored online exam last year. Citing withholding of results for a large number of students, the state government ordered a re-exam for engineering students. “The engineering colleges which had less than 10% pass percentage also have 95% pass in unsupervised online exam. The overall pass percentage is 98%. The universities should conduct proctored tests,” he said. In Madras University, more than 99% of students cleared exams in the previous semester, against 70% during the offline mode. Autonomous colleges like Loyola are monitoring exams through apps such as Google Meet with three layers of supervision. Universities say proctored online tests are not possible due to poor internet connectivity. Madras University vice-chancellor S Gowri said students from rural areas may not be able to attend proctored online tests due to poor network connectivity. “The proctored objective exam could have been modified with a descriptive type exam. However, we have to follow the government's decision,” Anna University vice-chancellor R Velraj said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/back-to-unsupervised-online-tests-for-university-students/articleshow/89066606.cms||A Ragu Raman

Due to the prolonged stagnation, sewage is now entering into houses and buildings adjoining the drains. Bala Ruban, a resident of Kannigapuram, had sent a written complaint to the chief minister’s cell on December 24 but no action has been taken yet. He had also written to the Avadi corporation commissioner on December 27, again which elicited no response. In his complaint, he had highlighted the plight of residents who are suffering due to sewage entering into their homes. Many are being affected by vector-borne illnesses.  “This has been the case during every rain season. The Avadi corporation has not yet cleared the SWD and it remains clogged for two months now,” he Bala Ruban. The drains are clogged with all types of non-biodegradable waste such as plastic bottles, covers, shoes, wrappers, among other items. The waste mixed with stagnated sewage has accumulated and overflowing into the open land, on which no can walk.. T Marimuthu, a resident of Kannigapuram, said his children were suffering due to the unhygenic conditions and and the mosquito problem had grown manifold due to the waste. “The mosquito menace is unbearable,” he said. Even though a former DMK councillor in the Kannigapuram locality (ward 25), Selvaraj, had taken up this issue with the officials in the past, a solution could not be found. Though Avadi is now a corporation, residents rued that it was only on paper and the corporation status does not reflect any work on the ground. TOI attempted to contact corporation commissioner R Saraswathi, who did not respond to messages. When called the Avadi corporation’s official number for comments, a staff member from the control room said the call could not be connected to the commissioner and hung up.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/avadi-storm-water-drains-turn-into-sewage-canals/articleshow/89066608.cms||Omjasvin M D

We warn the contemnors to be careful in future and to implement directions given by a court of law promptly,” said a division bench of Justice L Nageswara Rao and Justice B R Gavai. The apex court chose to close the proceedings instead of punishing the officers – M Vijayakumar (IAS), S Thinakaran, S Swarna (IAS), K Ramamoorthy, K Nanthakumar (IAS), K Shanmugam, K Manivasan (IAS), S K Prabhakar, and S Bakthavathchalam – but not without a stern warning. “We warn the contemnors to be careful in future and to implement directions given by a court of law promptly,” the court said. The issue pertains to an order passed by the Supreme Court on January 22, 2016, directing the officers to revise and publish the seniority list of the public works department. Since the order was not implemented, original petitioners moved the contempt plea. On October 1, 2021, the court found all nine officers guilty of the contempt. The court passed further directions to implement the 2016 order in its letter and spirit. When the plea came up for hearing on Wednesday, the government filed affidavits reporting compliance.

P Muthu Williams of Kodungaiyur moved the court after police refused to file an FIR on the allegations of the petitioner citing it to be civil in nature. The magistrate, after perusing the documents held that criminal complaints cannot be rejected only on grounds that allegations appear to be civil in nature and noted that the allegations leveled in the complaint show that police investigation is a must. The petitioner alleged misappropriation by senior office bearers in connection with a deal with a developer to construct guest rooms and commercial center in the 19.5 acres of plot owned by YMCA in Kottivakkam.

From balancing priorities to mind mapping to identifying key constraints to making first impressions, they got a glimpse on how to think, identify and solve a problem as a team and making a presentation with the solutions. While making a presentation on design thinking to the students, Arun Jain, chairman and managing director, Intellect Design Arena, said, “Around 50% of engineering students are not getting jobs as they are not employable. Engineering is still being taught in an old-fashioned way, which needs to be changed. Design thinking should be part of the engineering curriculum from the first year.” Studying to just score without being imaginative is an issue. Imagination would help students to grasp engineering principles better and they will learn engineering effectively, he said. It is a three stage workshop, said Anbu Rathinavel, head, School of Design Thinking. “First they will learn the design thinking concept, then, they will practise whatever they learn in the design thinking lab and after solving the problem, they will learn how to present a solution to a stakeholder or investor in the third stage.” This initiative has already been introduced in autonomous colleges as an optional course. In the next stage, students from different colleges would be put in groups of eight to twelve and they will work in a design thinking lab. Up to 100 students would work under a design thinking catalyst on a problem. “We are trying to take it to students where their thinking process has to be shifted. They will start seeing things differently,” Rathinavel said. Besides Tamil Nadu, engineering students from 27 states participated in the workshop and students from Singapore and Nepal also participated. In the next phase, the design thinking workshop will be held for first year and second year engineering students in the next few months.  Industry experts from Intellect Design Arena, School of Design Thinking, TIE, Confederation of Indian Industry and academic experts from institutes like IIM Ahmedabad, IIT-Delhi, and from other social sectors will guide the young minds on using design thinking on February 5.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/students-get-a-glimpse-of-design-thinking/articleshow/89066617.cms||---

Access to social pensions by the elderly, widows and the disabled, in particular, was weak due to cumbersome application processes and lack of automated systems for application and eligibility verification. "Over the next four years, the operation will help strengthen the state's capability to expand coverage and access to social assistance and to deliver cash transfers for the poor and vulnerable through a consolidated social registry," the World Bank said in a release posted on its website.The Bengal government in a statement said the foresight of CM Mamata Banerjee and her efforts to identify the problems of the weaker sections and redress these had paid huge dividends. The "Duare Sarkar" programme has been able to ensure improved and faster identification of beneficiaries, the statement said, and added that service delivery at doorsteps and monitoring of benefit delivery will get impetus under the World Bank-assisted scheme. The World Bank aid will also help digitize the state's unified delivery system, the Jai Bangla platform, to help consolidate disparate social assistance programmes and speed up delivery of social pensions. It will support the creation of a tele-consultation network for social services, complemented by a cadre of workers who can guide households. It will also address the issue of low participation of women in the state's labour force."Lack of coordination among departments leads to duplication of efforts in service delivery. The project will assist in overall system improvements, helping to significantly improve the capacity of the state government to identify beneficiaries faster, track expenditures, and plan and monitor benefit delivery for the vulnerable," said Shrayana Bhattacharya, Qaiser M Khan and Ambrish Shahi, World Bank's task team leaders for the project."With its fast-growing urban population and pockets of urban poor, West Bengal has recognized the need to move from a fragmented, scheme-based social protection system to providing an integrated basket of social protection benefits and services to its most vulnerable citizens," said Junaid Ahmad, the World Bank's Country Director in India. "The project will support and strengthen the state's capability in this area to ensure that it can deliver social protection services — both cash and in-kind — to all its vulnerable citizens."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/1000cr-world-bank-loan-to-expand-states-social-schemes/articleshow/89066622.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

---||Hyderabad||As Covid cases rise, elective surgeries put on hold in Hyderabad||HYDERABAD: The rise in Covid-19 cases across the city has hit elective surgeries across various government and private hospitals with many postponing their plans. Elective surgeries are scheduled procedures and not an emergency. During the second wave too, a similar situation was reported with multiple elective surgeries either called-off or postponed, amid the raging pandemic. Now, with the number of cases soaring, many patients scheduled to undergo a knee replacement surgery, bariatric surgery, gall bladder stone removal among others have been forced to put their plans on hold. “Over the past few days, we have observed that people who had to undergo surgeries for cataract, hernia among others are postponing their plans. In most cases, these are people who have comorbidities and do not want to take a chance. Even we are not recommending people to go ahead if there is a possibility to wait for some time,” said Dr Bharathkanth Reddy, chief operating officer of KIMS Hospitals, Secunderabad. Doctors said that some patients are also testing positive for Covid-19, just before their scheduled surgeries. “Before going in for a surgery, patients have to undergo an RT-PCR test. In some cases, they are turning out to be positive due to which we have to postpone the surgeries and quarantine them,” said Dr B Nagendar, superintendent at Osmania General Hospital. Priority is being given to life-saving surgeries. “In such cases, even if the patients are positive, we are going ahead with surgeries as they are inevitable,” said Dr M Manisegaran, senior general and surgical gastroenterologist, Yashoda Hospitals, Malakpet. Besides, several medical and nursing staff have also contracted the virus, thereby affecting surgeries, said doctors. Several hospitals have also restricted OPDs to contain the spread of Covid-19.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/as-cases-rise-elective-surgeries-put-on-hold/articleshow/89066627.cms||Preeti Biswas

The passengers have written to Etihad authorities to shift them to separate hotel rooms for isolation, instead of the six-people-in-a-room facility. They were also ready to pay for better facilities. One of the passengers, Ujwal Gollapudi, an operations manager for Amazon, has also complained that there was no proper internet facility at the place. He said while he wanted to resume work, but was unable to do it due to internet connectivity issues. “How long can we continue in such a difficult situation?” asked Ujwal. On Saturday, he was informed that they would have to be in Abu Dhabi until January 28. “The authorities said they would then leave me at the airport. But there is no information on providing private quarantine facility,” he said. While TOI reached out to the airline representatives to know on how the airline was addressing the various issues brought up by the stranded passengers, they failed to respond to a mail or calls. The passengers said being in a room with people having tested positive for Covid with symptoms would pose a hazard as they had no symptoms of Covid. “I’ll share your feedback of the quarantine facility for review,” was the response the passenger got on Etihad Help. The passengers have also appealed to union external affairs minister S Jaishankar and minister of state for external affairs Meenakshi Lekhi for help. “We tried contacting the embassy many times. We are getting looped between departments,” Ujwal said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/covid-hit-flyers-stranded-in-uae-face-double-whammy/articleshow/89066630.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

---||Hyderabad||Telangana HC nixes pleas against ethephon use on fruits||HYDERABAD: Brushing aside the objections over the directions issued by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) that permitted the use of ethephon for artificially ripening fruits, the Telangana high court has upheld the usage of this gaseous substance and dismissed three petitions that questioned the decision of the FSSAI. A bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Abhinand Kumar Shavili in its judgment also upheld the guidelines issued by Telangana and said that ethylene gas coming out of ethephon was far safer than the dangerous carbide gas that was being used till now to ripen the fruits. As the state was found promoting one such ethylene product called ‘Enripe’ sachets, the bench said there was nothing wrong with it. The bench in its order said: “Ethephon in small pouches are kept to generate ethylene gas and there is no conflict of statutory provisions as contained in insecticides rules or the Food Safety and Standards Act. Similarly, regulated use of ethephon only for the purpose of generating ethylene gas also does not fall under section 21(2) of the Food Safety and Standards Act, which prohibits the use of any insecticide on any article of food.” But, the bench made it clear that the state had still not discouraged the use of other ethylene products or sachets.Earlier carbide gas was used for the purpose of ripening fruits. The FSSAI, after a scientific study on the subject, had banned the use of carbide gas and acetylene gas due to their potential health hazards. The FSSAI, in its August 16, 2018 notification, said that ethephon in powder form may also be used as a source of ethylene gas provided that it was packed in sachets and these sachets containing ethephon in powder form not come in direct contact with fruits, the bench said, dismissing the apprehensions that ethephon would be thrown on food like mangoes to get them ripened.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/hc-nixes-pleas-against-ethephon-use-on-fruits/articleshow/89066632.cms||---

However, Ahmedabad police left their Telangana counterparts disappointed by declaring Umesh’s arrest in one of the cases pending against him in Gujarat after allegedly taking alerts from Telangana police. A team of Telangana police -- both Hyderabad and Cyberabad cops — which went to Ahmedabad to nab Umesh are likely to come back without the offender. Umesh was involved in chain snatching offences in Ahmedabad, Bengaluru and Mumbai. “Based on preliminary information which we got from Ahmedabad police, Umesh recently escaped from police custody while he was being shifted to judicial remand. Later, he came to Hyderabad and committed chain snatchings,” sources in Hyderabad police said. After the serial snatchings which took place on Wednesday, based on the CCTV recordings’ trail, the accused was traced to a hotel in Nampally where he checked in on January 18 by disclosing his actual name and submitted his Aadhaar and other ID proofs. He checked out of the hotel on January 19. While being on lookout to steal a bike, Umesh took a walk for five hours before he stole a two-wheeler in Asif Nagar. The accused’s image was caught in multiple CCTVs at the hotel. Using this vehicle, he committed chain snatching offences in Marredpally, Tukaramgate, Petbasheerabad and Medipally. Later, he abandoned the bike at Medipally. “There is no clarity as to how he reached Ahmedabad. He should be questioned to know these details,” an official in Cyberabad police said. Based on the details the accused declared while taking a hotel room in Nampally, a police team from Hyderabad and Cyberabad went to Ahmedabad and shared the information with a superintendent of police rank officer about the wanted accused. The state police will approach the court concerned in Gujarat before taking him into custody. This is expected to take several days.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/chain-snatcher-held-in-guj-t-cops-inputs-prove-crucial/articleshow/89066639.cms||---

This happened when the e-commerce company reported short supply to the Hyderabad-based supplier. During an internal probe, the business establishment found that between September and December, some persons in the logistics chain stole 1.35 crore worth gadgets. In December, the gadget supplier from CTC had lodged a complaint with Hyderabad Central Crime Station (CCS), which is still probing to identify the gadget thief in the supply chain. Anandit Infotech India Private Limited (AIIPL) has been selling SSD RAM, mother board, key board, graphic cards on a popular e-commerce platform for the past three years. At the behest of the online platform, a third party agent would come and pick up products from the supplier before it is transported to the e-commerce warehouse. When the products were picked up, as per the e-commerce company’s laid down shipment procedure, it was done through the company’s website. The delivery challans, pasting stickers and others were generated from the website. “However, in September, we first got a communication from the e-commerce platform that there was short supply. In October, we got another communication that once again there was short supply and this time the missing quantity was higher. In November, it increased further. Meanwhile, a few of our stolen gadgets were brought to CTC for re-sale by a person,” AIIPL accountant Parag Sheth said. They lost 4,262 boxes valued at 1.35 crore. When AIIPL representatives probed the person, who was in possession of the missing gadgets, they found that several people, in the logistics chain, were allegedly involved in the racket. Later, they approached CCS officials, who were still collecting documents from the companies involved in the logistics. Still, police were yet to identify who and how the gadgets were stolen.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/ctc-shocker-1-35-crore-gadgets-stolen-in-3-mths/articleshow/89066640.cms||---

After creating FDs, he allegedly gave forged receipts to TSWC. Recently, TSWC officials went to the bank after the one-year tenure of FDs was over. The bank officials, during verification, found that the receipts were fake. However, the bank officials found that the deposited amounts were intact.

---||Hyderabad||Indian vultures on death row, huge dip in numbers||HYDERABAD: While the proposed sanctuary for conservation of vultures in Adilabad’s Bejjur has failed to take off, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has classified Indian vulture as critically endangered even as its population is decreasing. IUCN’s latest red list of 2021 put the population of vultures on the decline. Palarapugutta cliff habitat in Penchikalpet forest range of Bejjur is one of the major breeding sites for the long-billed vulture. The forest department has proposed to establish the area as Jatayu wildlife sanctuary. However, the proposal has been kept in cold storage for the last few years. The extent of the proposed sanctuary is 325 square kilometres which falls in Bejjur, Penchikalpet, Koutala and Chintalamanepalli mandals. The area has Pranathia river and Peddavagu. Palarapugutta cliff is 200 metre high and has been identified as an ideal nesting location for vultures. IUCN said: “The species is placed in the range of 5,000-15,000 mature individuals. Survey results indicate that the decline throughout the Indian sub-continent probably began in the 1990s and was extremely rapid.” The vulture nests almost exclusively in colonies on cliffs and ruins. Although in one area where cliffs are absent, it has been reported nesting in trees. The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac, used to treat domestic livestock, has been identified as the cause of mortality with renal failure resulting in visceral gout found in a vast majority of vultures. “The recent ban on diclofenac in the region has, however, not eradicated its use in veterinary treatments, as it is still found in the carcasses of livestock and vultures. A second veterinary drug in use in India, ketoprofen, has also been identified to be lethal for the species. Measurements of residue levels in ungulate carcasses in India indicate that they are present in sufficient concentration to cause vulture mortalities,” said the IUCN. The IUCN has recommended full support for the ban on the veterinary use of diclofenac and encourage attempts to implement a ban on other vulture-toxic drugs.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/indian-vultures-on-death-row-huge-dip-in-numbers/articleshow/89066644.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

The district collectors have to shortlist the beneficiaries in consultation with local MLA. Every beneficiary will get 10 lakh without bank linkage and units will be sanctioned based on beneficiaries’ choice,” Somesh Kumar said. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has already launched Dalit Bandhu in Huzurabad and Vasalamarri village in Yadadri-Bhongiri district in August, 2021. Four mandals each in four SC-reserved assembly constituencies were also included in the scheme. Under the scheme, 10 lakh would be given to each beneficiary to utilize the amount for identified programmes. Though the decision to implement the scheme in all the constituencies was taken earlier, the government could not implement it due to the model code and Rythu Bandhu scheme payments. The state government has already released 1,191 crore to the district collectors and the remaining amount would be released before the end of the financial year. As of now, 18,000 beneficiaries have been identified in Huzurabad constituency and Vasalamarri village. However, 947 beneficiaries in Huzurabad and 57 in Vasalamarri have availed the scheme (grounded) after completing all the procedures.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/dalit-bandhu-to-be-rolled-out-across-state-by-march/articleshow/89066646.cms||Koride Mahesh

With this status, many financial institutions could fund the project if the state government wants to avail loans. The corporation had taken about 60,000 crore from various banks and financial institutions till now. Though the corporation, headed by special chief secretary of irrigation Rajat Kumar, was floated in 2015, the state government has included Palamuru-Rangareddy lift irrigation scheme (PRLIS) as an additional mandate. “The corporation has been involved in developing, engineering, financing and executing the project to irrigate 37 lakh acres in the state and provide 10 thousand million cubic( tmc) feet (ft) drinking water to en route villages and 30 tmc ft for Hyderabad. Apart from this, it would provide 16 tmc ft for industrial usage,” engineer-in-chief B Hari Ram told TOI.He said with the financial support of banks, financial institutions and the state government’s equity, the main trunk of the project from Medigadda barrage to Kondapochamma Sagar has been completed in a record time. The corporation has been making payments, both interest and principal demands, to the banks promptly, the engineer-in-chief said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/kaleshwaram-irrigation-firm-gets-rating-boost/articleshow/89066647.cms||---

---||India||Why pick seat based on caste: Yogi to Akhilesh||Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath launched a counter-attack on SP chief Akhilesh Yadav for questioning the former’s candidature from a “safe” seat, saying that the Gorakhpur constituency, which BJP has chosen for him to make his debut in the assembly polls, was not one which reflected the “dynastic and caste-based principles”. Akhilesh had wondered why Yogi had ‘returned’ to Gorakhpur, which he represented in the Lok Sabha for over two decades, when there was talk of him contesting from Ayodhya or Mathura. In an interview to Times Now Navbharat, Yogi slammed Akhilesh for choosing for himself the Yadav-dominated Karhal constituency in Mainpuri, a bastion of the SP’s first family, saying: “Akhilesh has been the CM of the state. Of the 403 seats, why does he go to a constituency which is dominated by a particular caste?” Without taking Akhilesh’s name, chief minister Yogi said such people aimed to come to power only to serve the interests of their dynasty. “What do you expect from someone who wakes up on-ly at 12 noon and then takes two hours to get ready, and then it is time for such kids to go cycling. A state is not run like this. To run a state like UP, you require a strong commitment,” he said. On the exit of the three OBC ministers in his government — Swami Prasad Maurya, Dara Singh Chauhan and Dharam Singh Saini — who have crossed over to the SP, Yogi said such people are “dissatisfied souls and they will go on wandering”. “They will be in Congress, in BJP, sometimes in SP and BSP. Their souls will never be satisfied,” he said. The CM said BJP had neither weaned away any leader from the opposition parties nor had it stopped anyone from leaving the saffron ranks. On SP patriarch Mulayam Singh’s daughter-in-law Aparna Yadav joining BJP, Yogi said she was not encouraged in her former party because she had a vision. “They were perturbed by her social activity, because she worked for the welfare of cows, the disabled.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-pick-seat-based-on-caste-yogi-to-akhilesh/articleshow/89066547.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Rs 1,000 crore World Bank loan to expand West Bengal’s social schemes||KOLKATA: The World Bank has approved a $125-million loan (around Rs 1,000 crore) to Bengal to expand coverage of around 400 state-run social schemes, especially direct cash transfers targeted at the vulnerable sections, over the next four years. The Bank said a recent survey had found that while food and in-kind transfers reached most poor and vulnerable households in Bengal, the coverage of cash transfers was weak. Access to social pensions by the elderly, widows and the disabled, in particular, was weak due to cumbersome application processes and lack of automated systems for application and eligibility verification. “Over the next four years, the operation will help strengthen the state’s capability to expand coverage and access to social assistance and to deliver cash transfers for the poor and vulnerable through a consolidated social registry,” the World Bank said in a release posted on its website. The Bengal government in a statement said the foresight of CM Mamata Banerjee and her efforts to identify the problems of the weaker sections and redress these had paid huge dividends. The “Duare Sarkar” programme has been able to ensure improved and faster identification of beneficiaries, the statement said, and added that service delivery at doorsteps and monitoring of benefit delivery will get impetus under the World Bank-assisted scheme. The World Bank aid will also help digitize the state’s unified delivery system, the Jai Bangla platform, to help consolidate disparate social assistance programmes and speed up delivery of social pensions.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/1000cr-world-bank-loan-to-expand-states-social-schemes/articleshow/89066655.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

Cops said that the condition of the woman, Ananya Biswas (45), is serious and she is admitted at SSKM Hospital. Her son, Suryangshu Narayan Biswas (18), was admitted at Baghajatin Hospital and is stable. Bansdroni police and fire department have confirmed that injuries were caused by a lightning strike. “The entire house was in a disarray. The lightning had travelled downward and windows were damaged even on the first floor. Inside the room, curtains and few clothes were reduced to shreds. Household articles too had caught fire,” said an investigating officer.According to Suryangshu, he was sleeping and his grandfather was in another room. His mother, was having tea close to his bed at around 7.15am when the incident took place. “Suddenly, there was a deafening sound. It sounded like a transformer blast. The next moment, a fireball seemed to be ripping through our home even as the curtains caught fire. My grandfather’s bed broke into two and he was thrown onto the floor. I was still under my quilt and saw the fireball sail over me. My grandfather and I received minor scratches. My mother was hurt on her face, neck and hands,” he said. Suryangshu’s father, a hotelier, is travelling on work. “Basically, modern homes are full of things that can conduct electricity and lightning can “jump” short distances through the air from one conductive surface to another,” said a forensic expert.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/freak-lightning-incident-injures-mom-son-at-home/articleshow/89066659.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||Signs of business revival at malls in Kolkata||KOLKATA: Mall operators in Kolkata have spotted green shoots of recovery from the third wave that saw footfall crash by 80%-85% from the festive high in December-end. At Acropolis, footfall that had slumped after restrictions were announced in January-beginning saw recovery by almost 50% this week. The promotional sales on Republic Day, end-of-season sale and Saraswati Puja and Valentine's Day lined up, mall general manager K Vijayan expects footfall to recover to the pre-restriction level by mid-February. "The footfall slump was owing to the initial fear of a repeat of the second wave. Once it was clear that the third wave was nowhere close to being as bad as the second wave, customers felt confident enough to walk back. From just essential sales, we are beginning to see activity in food and beverage and other non-essential category sales, said mall general manager K Vijayan. Though the recovery at luxury mall Quest has been a lot slower at 20%, mall vice-president Sanjeev Mehra believes people are just waiting for the government to send out the right signals before the situation turns around dramatically. "I think we are nearing the end of the pandemic. That is the signal that the West is sending out. Once that signal goes out here, and I think that should happen before April, the year 2022-23 will turn out to be a record one with people stepping out to spend," he remarked. The latter half of 2021 saw the pent-up demand drive sales to beyond pre-pandemic level despite food and beverage contributing 70% of pre-Covid revenue and cinema only 30% of what it grossed in 2019. At South City, it is still way short of what it was three weeks ago. But the mall operator says there has been a visible recovery in the past week with indications that sales will pick up in the next couple of weeks. “People are back in the food court though restaurants are still struggling due to the 10pm deadline. If the night restriction timing is pushed back to 11pm, dinner will be back on the table,” said a mall representative. The other malls — City Centre 1 at Salt Lake, City Centre 2 at New Town, Mani Square of EM Bypass, Forum and Forum Courtyard on Elgin Road and Diamond City Mall — also saw visitors stream back and bring cheer to retailers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/signs-of-business-revival-at-malls/articleshow/89066660.cms||Subhro Niyogi

Students are being asked to focus on their health rather than worry about missing tests and online classes. Schools like Don Bosco Liluah, Lakshmipat Singhania Academy and DPS Newtown have reached out to students with sympathetic messages. St Augustine’s Day School, Shyamnagar, has organized virtual sessions for medical support and is planning to send teachers to students’ houses to help them with studies. Julien Day School, Ganganagar, sent a healing message to students, assuring them of help and asking them not to get worried about missing online classes.Don Bosco, Liluah, principal Monoj Josh wrote in his message: “Many of you are unwell and some of our school staff are unwell too…so we need to co-operate with one another in this time of need.” The school authority has asked them to take rest and ‘regain your health’. ‘Do not worry about classes and the unit tests’, it said.Julien Day School, Ganganagar, principal Bobby Baxter wrote in his message, “…if you have missed any exams due to ill health, please inform the school and we will find an alternative solution. Any students requiring remedial classes before the final exams, please come forward for help.” St Augustine’s Day School, Shyamnagar, principal Fr Rodney Borneo said: “We want to resume the initiative ‘Project Boost’ like before to bridge online and offline classes where teachers visit students’ houses and teach a few students of the same class who live in the area.”Some other schools have circulated an advisory to students after considering the present situation. South Point School and The Heritage School have already sensitized students. An advisory had been sent by South Point principal where the students were asked to behave responsibly. “To avoid getting yourselves and your loved ones infected in the expected upsurge of Covid infections, please wear proper masks and maintain hand sanitization. As adults and responsible South Pointers, spread the message and sensitize those you know.”“We have found that among the 10-15 students who have not been turning up for vaccination are Covid positive or their family members may be infected,” said South Point trustee Krishna Damani. Lakshmipat Singhania Academy has sanitized students by giving basic instructions like asking them to stay indoors, avoid gatherings, use good quality masks and get vaccinated.DPS Newtown has started their vaccination camp on the school premises from Friday. The school has mentioned in the notice: “Get yourself tested in case you have any symptoms so that medication can start. Have proper diet and maintain hygiene.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/schools-counsel-students-send-healing-messages-to-tide-over-the-covid-crisis/articleshow/89066661.cms||---
---||Kolkata||IPGMER gets state sanction for infectious diseases unit||KOLKATA: The Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education and Research (IPGMER) has received the administrative sanction from the state for its infectious diseases (ID) department. This will pave the way for the institute to start a superspeciality course on ID. If all goes well, the state-run institute will be the second in Bengal to run this course after STM. In the latest order from the health department, the state has approved the creation of 50 new posts in different categories for the ID department at IPGMER & SSKM Hospital. TOI on November 24 had reported the hospital creating an ID ward at Sambhunath Pandit Hospital (SNPH), its satellite unit. Outdoor services had also been initiated. Currently two faculty members — Yogiraj Ray and Ayan Basu — have been posted in the department. The order from the health department has allowed the creation of four more posts for faculty members along with nursing staff, medical technologists and junior doctors. “A 60-bed ward has already been created. Along with the creation of posts, we will also require to gradually upgrade facilities, including the laboratory,” said IPGMER director Manimoy Banerjee. In December, National Medical Council gave its approval to School of Tropical Medicine, Kolkata, to start the three seats of DM in ID. IPGMER is expected to apply for four seats once it gets ready with all required infrastructure, including manpower. Being a multispeciality hospital where transplant surgeries are conducted regularly, IPGMER has an advantage. “Transplant infections are part of the curriculum to study infectious diseases. So that is an added advantage at IPGMER,” said ID associate professor Yogiraj Ray. With only a handful of ID specialists in the country, the dearth was felt in the pandemic. While only a couple of institutes teaches ID, a few medical colleges in other states are also trying to set up such departments.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/ipgmer-gets-state-sanction-for-infectious-diseases-unit/articleshow/89066662.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kolkata||West Bengal health department may scale down tele-medicine wing||KOLKATA: The number of calls to the state health department’s helpline numbers for Covid-19 has dropped sharply. Even as the third-wave surge has seen a higher number of people being infected than in the second wave, calls for tele-medicine and tele-counselling have gone down significantly. The state health department might now tweak the size of the team for these tele-calling services if the number of calls keeps dipping. The government had launched the services for tele-medicine consultation, psychological counselling and queries related to Covid-19, including help with hospital admission, around August in 2020 during the first wave of the pandemic. A large number of doctors and counsellors had been deployed for these 24x7 services. “The three services would receive 9,000 calls per day on an average during the first two waves of the pandemic, the number being higher during the second wave. But now the call count has dropped down to 50% despite the third wave being a bigger surge. That is the reason why we might scale down the manpower and engage them in other services,” said a senior health official. The telemedicine services were launched from Swasthya Bhavan and SSKM Hospital (IPGMER). At IPGMER, about 30 doctors, including medical officers and specialists pooled in from different medical colleges, are attending to the calls in shifts at present. “No doubt the number of calls has dropped sharply, but the services will continue as long as we get a directive from Swasthya Bhawan officials to discontinue them,” said an official at IPGMER. Due to the reduced calls, the health department has also started tracking people in home isolation by contacting them though the call centres from the first week of January. “For now, the services will continue because there are still people calling up the helpline.

With the number of affected slowly climbing down, the Hotel and Restaurants’ Association of Eastern India (HRAEI) believes this weekend could see a turnaround but attendance will remain relatively low till the shutdown time is extended from the present 10pm. “We saw attendance drop below 10% in the second week of January. But with Covid numbers now coming down, footfalls are rising and we expect it to remain stagnant for some weeks now. On an average, Kolkata restaurants now have a 50% attendance with a cap of 50% on seating capacity,” said HRAEI president Sudesh Poddar, who owns Songhai, Manthan and MS Bar on central Kolkata. Footfall has gone up to 50%-60% of the reduced capacity at Oudh 1590 and Chapter 2. “Since the peak of the third wave seems to be over, people have now started venturing out and that has been reflected in the attendance at our outlets since last Monday. This weekend should see a further increase in footfall,” said Shiladitya Chaudhury, co-founder of Oudh 1590 and Chapter 2. He added that most of his outlets had a capacity crowd for lunch on Saturday. Restaurateurs, however, are keeping their fingers crossed for this weekend. “The transmission rate has come down over the last one week and the fear has started receding. At the same time, many are yet to recover from the after-affects of Covid and have cough and cold. Some have family members in isolation. So the crowd wont’ swell overnight. But it is inching towards normalcy, so the footfall should get better this weekend and the next,” said Pratap Daryanani, owner of Oasis on Park Street. Patrons have started trickling back at Mocambo and Peter Cat, which have remained fully occupied for lunch and dinner this week. “The fear seems to have gone and people are ready to come out for meals. Even though the previous two weeks had been bad, this week has been better. Though many more got infected this time, the illness was mild and recovery quick. Once the 50% restriction is lifted, the attendance will swell further,” said Mocambo and Peter Cat owner Nitin Kothari. Others like What’s Up! Café on Southern Avenue are yet to get over the lean period. “Since we must shut down by 10pm, guests are forced to wind up by 8.30pm and have been skipping dinner. Till the closing time is deferred to 11pm, the evening crowd won’t swell. But we have still had a rise in footfall this week,” said What’s Up! Café owner Anirban Sengupta.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/footfall-crawls-up-at-restos-after-a-brief-lean-period/articleshow/89066664.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

Cops said that the condition of the woman, Ananya Biswas (45), is serious and she is admitted at SSKM Hospital. Her son, Suryangshu Narayan Biswas (18), was admitted at Baghajatin Hospital and is stable. Bansdroni police and fire department have confirmed that injuries were caused by a lightning strike. “The entire house was in a disarray. The lightning had travelled downward and windows were damaged even on the first floor. Inside the room, curtains and few clothes were reduced to shreds. Household articles too had caught fire,” said an investigating officer. According to Suryangshu, he was sleeping and his grandfather was in another room. His mother, was having tea close to his bed at around 7.15am when the incident took place. “Suddenly, there was a deafening sound. It sounded like a transformer blast. The next moment, a fireball seemed to be ripping through our home even as the curtains caught fire. My grandfather’s bed broke into two and he was thrown onto the floor. I was still under my quilt and saw the fireball sail over me. My grandfather and I received minor scratches. My mother was hurt on her face, neck and hands,” he said. Suryangshu’s father, a hotelier, is travelling on work. “Basically, modern homes are full of things that can conduct electricity and lightning can “jump” short distances through the air from one conductive surface to another,” said a forensic expert.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/freak-lightning-strikes-mom-son-at-s-kol-home/articleshow/89066665.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||App helps cops book 6,000 in two days for road rule violations||KOLKATA: Police have started prosecuting all traffic offences, barring drink driving, on the spot using an integrated Citation App. Sergeants and constables started using it from last week. The impact has been immediate. From around 2,700-2,800 prosecutions per day (a combination of citation and spot fines), in the past two days, cops have prosecuted more than 6,000 motorists and two-wheeler riders — 3,352 on Thursday and 3,359 on Friday. “Earlier, the Citation App was meant to serve a limited purpose. Only constables and junior officers could use it and prosecute only under Motor Vehicle Act, where the fine would be Rs 100. Several important prosecutions like one-way violations were not covered by this app. But the recent Covid experience where 56 sergeants contracted the disease this month at the same time made us realize we need to use technology to reduce the cop-motorist interface yet carry on with the prosecutions as well. We have reintroduced spot fines and now allowed sergeants to use this app. The app was upgraded and new MV Act and their related prosecutions were added. Even the upper limit of fines have been increased from Rs 100 up to Rs 2,000,” said a senior officer. “To make the app more user-friendly, we also merged the modified challan app with the Kolkata traffic police Challan Generation app. This app will be available only for traffic officers. This is why, once we have the photo evidence from our traffic cameras or temporary cameras placed at strategic locations, we are able to stop the offender at a suitable spot and then proceed with the citation case. We are offering the motorist the option to challenge the evidence as we are sending the SMS generated quickly to the end user,” said DC (Traffic) Arijit Sinha.  “While spot fines are important, citation cases are really helpful when there are several constraints in carrying out the spot fines. Since the system was already operational, we did not face any technical issue,” said a Jadavpur Traffic Guard sergeant.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/app-helps-cops-book-6k-in-two-days-for-road-rule-violations/articleshow/89066666.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Locked in room, woman dies as fire breaks out||KOLKATA: Bakul Adhikary , a 72-year-old woman, reportedly mentally challenged and locked inside a room alone, died a violent and lonely death after receiving severe burn injuries inside her one-room godown residence at Vidyasagar Colony close to Netaji Nagar. The fire was reported around 12.30pm on Saturday and two fire tenders from Patuli doused the flames in the next 20 minutes. The local councillor and her supporters joined residents in the rescue operation. By the time the woman could be rescued, she was found unconscious. She was later declared brought dead at the hospital. Police said they were still not certain why the woman was locked inside the room by her son, who had left for work earlier in the day. Netaji Nagar police are ascertaining how the fire started in the afternoon and the reason behind it. “It could be due to a short circuit or she might have caught fire while cooking. Being mentally challenged, she may have failed to raise an alarm on time. It’s also possible she did try to get out but found the door locked from outside. It was only when the flames were visible from outside did locals reacted,” said an officer, adding a forensic team will probe the cause of fire.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/locked-in-room-woman-dies-as-fire-breaks-out/articleshow/89066667.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The woman, who started Facebook live on her smartphone during the incident, lodged a complaint with Dum Dum GRP on Saturday with the footage of the video she had recorded. Police are looking for the accused. But no one has been arrested in this connection yet. According to the complaint, the woman, a resident of New Alipore and a tattoo artist, had boarded the Sealdah-bound Down Shantipur Local from Fulia around 6.35pm. “When the train left Dum Dum station the ladies’ compartment was empty and I was alone. A youth got into the running train and tried to touch me. I pushed him away, but he persisted. I took out my cell phone and started Facebook live. He got off while the train was entering Sealdah station,” she said. A case has been registered under IPC section 354.

---||Kolkata||West Bengal Covid positivity rate dips over 9 days to third wave’s lowest||KOLKATA: The Covid positivity rate in Bengal has been on the decline for the nine consecutive days and it dipped to 11.1% on Saturday, the lowest during the third wave. On Saturday, the number of tests conducted in the last 24 hours — 82,564 — has been the highest during the entire pandemic. Despite that, only 9,191 fresh cases were reported. Only 37 up from that of Friday, which had about 10,000 fewer tests conducted. Health experts are confident of the infection rate getting slow in the state, but said we need to see how things go in the districts over the next seven days. “If districts also see a steep decline over the next seven days, it would be the beginning of the end of this wave,” said IPGMER professor of surgery Diptendra Sarkar. The state’s cumulative positivity had shot up to as high as 37% on January 10, during which Kolkata had reported close to 70% positivity. Now, even as the weekly positivity for the city between January 14 and 20, according to the health and family welfare data, is 39.4%, laboratories across Kolkata are reporting positivity between 25% and 30%. Between January 7 and 16, Kolkata’s weekly positivity was 59%. “Positivity indicates the severity of transmission. This is a good sign, indicating transmission rate is coming down. At the same time, we need to reduce mortality and probe whether it is a comorbidity of Covid while increasing tests. If we can bring down the death rate, we will see brighter things in another two to three weeks,” said senior physician Sukumar Mukherjee, member Bengal’s Global Advisory Board for Covid-19. While laboratories attached with hospitals still have a positivity rate hovering around 30% to 35%, the stand-alone laboratories are reporting a much lower rate. “The positivity rate has now gone down to about 25% in our laboratories across the city. It is quite natural for hospital-attached labs to have a relatively higher positivity as we tend to get a larger number of samples from asymptomatic patients for several purposes, including travel,” said Somnath Chatterjee, MD Suraksha Diagnostics. The constant climb down in the positivity rate began from January 14. On Saturday, Kolkata recorded 1,489 fresh cases — only 114 up from Friday. Experts said the increase is insignificant compared to the increased number of tests. “Decrease in rate of infection is satisfying for public health physicians, but there are a few worrisome points. Cases, as well as deaths, are now coming from rural parts and this should be a point of concern. People with mild symptoms are not going for tests either. So the real picture of Covid infection may not be reflected in total. We need to be vigilant and should observe for two more weeks,” said public health specialist Anirban Dalui. In fact, weekly positivity-wise, Malda has taken over Kolkata by a slight margin this week. Districts, like Birbhum, Darjeeling and Kalimpong, also continue to have positivity above 30%. With seven days having passed since the congregation at Gangasagar Mela, health experts feel the chances of a flaring up of numbers from the gathering is now low. “This is thanks to the focussed intervention and screening done by the state administration before allowing pilgrims to proceed. Those extra, careful measures have probably given us a positive result,” Sarkar said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/bengal-vity-rate-dips-over-9-days-to-3rd-waves-lowest/articleshow/89066671.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kolkata||West Bengal responds to citizens’ plea, to reopen parks from tomorrow||KOLKATA: Rabindra Sarobar, Subhas Sarobar and all major parks in Kolkata are set to reopen from Monday. Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA) and Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) authorities recognised demands from a section of senior citizens and morning walkers and decided to reopen lakes and parks under their jurisdiction from Monday. Officials of KMDA, the custodian of both Rabindra and Subhas Sarobar, said that the lakes will reopen for three hours daily — from 6am to 9am — for 18+ age group vaccinated citizens. A KMC parks department official on Saturday said the parks will be reopened for morning walkers for three hours in the morning— 6 am to 9am. Again, the parks will open for three hours from 3pm. The decision to reopen parks was taken after the civic brass started receiving appeals from citizens across Kolkata. A large section of morning walkers of Rabindra Sarobar were repeatedly requesting the government authorities to allow the lake to reopen for a few hours in the morning. A section of them even wrote to the state chief secretary and KMDA. KMDA had forwarded a proposal to the urban development department last week. “We thank the urban development department and KMDA for allowing morning walkers to enter the lake for their morning walks, which will help them to boost their immunity and physical fitness. Morning walkers are requested to maintain safe distance and wear masks,” said environmentalist Somendra Mohan Ghosh. Ghosh added that the authorities should also consider reopening the lakes from 4pm to 6pm soon for those who prefer their daily strolls in the evening. The reopening of parks will take place in phases. In the first phase, all major parks have been reopened. In the next phase, the neighbourhood small and medium parks will be unlocked for the citizens. “We received several requests from citizens, especially from morning walkers, to reopen parks. Then we took up the matter with the civic brass, who readily agreed and gave a nod,” said a KMC official. However, reopening small parks in the neighbourhood where Covid cases are still on the rise will be kept out of bounds for the residents. “We can’t take the risk of reopening parks where several Covid cases are still active. And those who will be allowed to enter large parks will need to follow Covid protocols,” said a civic official. Swati Ghosh, a resident of Lake View Road and a senior citizen, welcomed the decision. “It is the need of the hour. As a morning walker, I was feeling totally confined,” said Ghosh. In New Town, there are a few parks maintained by NKDA and a section of residents there also want the parks to be reopened for them. NKDA officials said Eco Park Ring Road was open for morning walkers where people were having their daily stroll. “As for the parks in New Town, there is not much demand for its reopening as of now but will reopen them if there are demands,” said an official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/state-responds-to-citizens-plea-to-reopen-parks-from-tomorrow/articleshow/89066672.cms||Suman Chakraborti
---||Kolkata||Met spies rain in Kolkata, districts today and tomorrow||KOLKATA: The city and its neighbouring districts may receive spells of light to moderate rain on Sunday and Monday under the impact of a western disturbance (WD). Some areas in and around the city are set to receive thunderstorms as well, said the Met office. It has also predicted that the temperature will remain unchanged till January 26. Kolkata recorded a minimum temperature of 17.4 degree Celsius on Saturday. “We expect the weather conditions to remain overcast accompanied with spells of drizzle on Sunday and Monday. Along with Kolkata, Howrah, North and South 24 Parganas, East and West Midnapore, Nadia, Murshidabad and West Burdwan, too, may receive drizzles,” said a Met official. A north-south low-pressure trough between Bihar and Chhattisgarh and another one which is stretching between Rajasthan and Bengal are set to form over the next 24 hours as the western disturbance approaches. These will generate clouds and lead to light drizzles in the city. “But the rain will be restricted to 20 mm-30 mm in Kolkata and may occur on Sunday and Monday,” said Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) director GK Das. “It will remain cloudy and the intermittent rain will continue on Monday. We expect that the weather will improve from the second half of Monday. But sporadic drizzles may still occur,” said Das. “We expect the temperature to fall after January 26 when the effects of the western disturbance start waning. But since we are approaching the end of winter, the fall in temperature may not be a very significant one,” he added. Till then, the difference between the maximum and the minimum temperature will narrow down to two-three degrees. Western disturbances are common in winter and they lead to rain and a temperature rise, said Das. This is the third occasion this winter when a WD has led to rain and a temperature rise in Kolkata and south Bengal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/met-spies-rain-in-kolkata-dists-today-and-tomorrow/articleshow/89066673.cms||---

A team from Nagpada PS came to Kolkata and sought help from New Market police to arrest Syed Yousuf Jamal (46) and his wife Naaz Sayed (44). “The victim met the accused at a party. The accused told the woman that he wanted to introduce her to his wife. When the woman arrived at the couple’s then residence at Baba Saheb Ambedkar Road, the duo allegedly spiked her drinks and food with drugs and filmed her in an obscene manner. They then used these photographs to extort about Rs 1.5 crore from her. The accused also allegedly practised black magic on her. The woman approached Mumbai Police last March,” said an officer. “The team led by Nagpada assistant inspector Dhanraj Prabhale arrived on Friday morning. A joint raid took place at a hotel near New Market at night. We arrested Syed during the raid. Naaz was arrested on Saturday morning. They were produced in a local court that granted Mumbai police four days of transitional remand,” said an officer. “Syed is facing charges of rape, unnatural sex, extortion, poisoning, cheating, criminal breach of trust, criminal intimidation along with relevant sections of IT Act and the specific Maharashtra Prevention and Eradication of Human Sacrifice and other Evil and Aghori Practices and Black Magic Act,” said a Lalbazar officer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/mum-rape-accused-nabbed-in-new-mkt/articleshow/89066674.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Clear backlog of birth and death certificates fast, says Mayor Firhad Hakim||KOLKATA: Mayor Firhad Hakim has asked the Kolkata Municipal Corporation health department officials to expedite the process of issuance of birth and death certificates from the civic headquarters. After attending the interactive session with the citizens — Talk to Mayor — Hakim on Saturday said that the officials in the birth and death certificate were asked to attend to more applicants as applications were pending in large numbers. The number of applications shot up after the majority of the employees working in the civic body’s birth and death certificate wing fell ill after a surge in Covid numbers. The situation worsened to such an extent that the wing had to be shut down for a week. “As the situation has improved now, we have reopened our birth and death certificate wing. But our officials are struggling to clear pending cases. We may need to rope in employees from some other wings from the health department to cope with the pressure,” said a KMC health department senior official. Under the prevalent system, an applicant needs to apply for a birth or death certificate using the a Chatbot service (8335999111). The KMC officials at the headquarters will respond and give a date for verification of documents. If the documents are valid, the birth or death certificate may be issued on the given day of appointment. “Given the pendency, we are unable to verify a large number of applications and thus some of the applicants are getting impatient,” said a civic worker. But, the civic brass is against reverting to old drop-box system due to Covid. “We can’t tell applicants to use the drop box as that will make the queue longer on a given day,” said a KMC health official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/clear-backlog-of-birth-and-death-certs-fast-mayor/articleshow/89066675.cms||Saikat Ray

The workshop was held at Satyanarayan AC market, which was once gutted 15 years ago. The exercise was attended by representatives of several markets, including Rajakatra, Nandaram and Kajaria. “Markets are gradually reopening and rush is also increasing. We have decided to carry out checks in Burrabazar markets and also share measures to help traders safeguard their lives and livelihoods,” said a senior fire department officer. The fire team demonstrated how to tackle different kinds of fire. “We shared the information with traders and checked their resources,” said the officer. “Some small steps, like keeping the wiring in good shape and not allowing cooking and smoking inside the markets, can prevent fire incidents by half,” said a cop. Market committees said they had either complied with fire safety guidelines or were in the process. “Most markets here are over 100 years old. We don’t have space for big water reservoirs. We will consult the fire department to find a way out,” said the secretary of a market in Burrabazar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/fire-safety-drill-for-burrabazar-markets/articleshow/89066676.cms||Zeeshan Javed

While Mehta described the incident as “sad and regressive”, Pattanaik tweeted saying: “Gay Indian soldiers are not allowed to love. Kshatriyas are supposed to be brave, not puritanical”. Sachin Ujjwal, the ADG strategic communication of IHQ of MoD (Army), wrote an email to the director on Wednesday stating that the “content of the script received via email dated 16 December 2021 has been analyzed in detail. It is regretted to inform that the script has not been cleared by IHQ of MoD (Army). Wishing you best of luck in all the future endeavours”. Calls to Ujjwal from TOI on this went unanswered till the time of going to the press. Riddhi Sen, who won the National Award in 2017 for playing a transwoman in Kaushik Ganguly’s ‘Nagarkirtan’, described it as an extremely ‘unfortunate but not a surprising incident’. “The Central Board of Film Certification had got us to delete two beautiful same-sex love-making scenes from ‘Nagarkirtan’,” he said. “Films these days about the army portray soldiers as superheroes. That image needs to be broken,” added Riddhi, who has acted in a film produced by Onir. Documentary director Debalina, who made ‘Gay India Matrimony’ with Films Division in 2019, said that film-makers are being cornered from all sides now. “Every passing day the noose is just tightening around our neck. The rejection of Onir’s film is a sign of the times we live in. After my own documentary received critical acclaim, it was certified adult by CBFC. Once that happened, Films Division stopped sending it to any festival. We are hitting an all-time low now,” she said. According to queer feminist activist Malobika, co-founder of queer feminist organization Sappho For Equality, “The Supreme Court in 2018 has partially read down IPC 377. Therefore, consensual sex between same-sex individuals is no longer crime. How does anyone's profession really matter? I have not read Onir’s script but from what I hear about the incident, I can say that rejecting it only exposes the hypocrisy of the system.” Onir is “overwhelmed” by the support from LGBTQIA community. “There is outrage and hurt for something so unfair. I am touched by the support from within the industry too. Nimisha Sajayan of ‘The Great Indian Kitchen’ messaged saying ‘let’s fight this together’. But, at the same time, I am disappointed by the silence of the MoD,” said Onir.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/support-pours-in-for-filmmaker-on-social-media-after-script-rejection/articleshow/89066677.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: After quitting WA group, BJP’s rebel Bankura MLA fries ‘chops’||KOLKATA: It happens only in Bengal when a savoury or snack becomes a symbol of political rebellion. After quitting BJP’s WA groups, BJP MLA Niladri Sekhar Dana has posted pictures of himself frying chops — the Bengali savoury — in Bankura. As if to dispel doubts about the political nature of the statement, he said that his act followed Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee extolling the virtues of local home grown industry. Dana, a veteran in the BJP, stirred controversy over his act on Saturday morning when he started frying chops at a roadside shop near his residence in the Kankata area. Locals were taken by surprise to find the lawmaker frying chops — often a focal point of political debates in Bengal. He was even seen selling the savoury to those who wanted to have a spicy morning breakfast. Hours later, Dana said he was inspired by CM Banerjee’s urge to promote small and micro entrepreneurship. “The chief minister has time and again promoted small entrepreneurs and chop is one of the savouries that’s popular across Bengal. I tried to promote these micro entrepreneurs who earn a decent living by frying chops. This is not the first time I have tried my hands at frying chops. People in Bankura are fond of chop and muri (puffed rice),” he said. Dana, who rose up the ranks in BJP from being an ordinary worker and a councillor, is among the first batch of dissidents who voiced disagreement with the recent organisational shuffle. Four BJP MLAs, including Dana, pulled out of BJP’s WhatsApp group in protest against the newly appointed party presidents for Bankura and Bishnupur organisational districts. Dana even wrote to BJP national president J P Nadda requesting him to reconsider the shuffle. Local BJP leaders, however, pointed out that Dana was seen running a sewing machine himself and preparing masks at home during the pandemic. “There is no infighting in BJP. However, I will ask him the reasons,” said Sunil Rudra Mandal, BJP’s district president for Bankura. BJP national vice president Dilip Ghosh said if there was any disagreement, it could only be solved through discussions inside the party. “Such things should come to an end and the solution is in discussion with the aggrieved person. Some of our leaders were unwell and could not meet party workers during the pandemic,” he said. The BJP MLA’s act, however, did not go unnoticed by the Trinamool Congress. TMC’s Taldangra MLA Arup Chakraborty said Dana had finally realised the demand for chop in this state. “He might be from a different party, but he has learnt from what the chief minister wanted to convey,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/after-quitting-wa-group-bjps-rebel-bankura-mla-fries-chops/articleshow/89066678.cms||Falguni Banerjee
---||Kolkata||DMs from Bengal skip virtual meet with PM Narendra Modi||KOLKATA: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday virtually interacted with DMs of various districts, but Bengal DMs skipped the meeting. Several of the state’s DMs told TOI they had no information about the meeting. Earlier, in May 2021, the PM had an interaction with DMs but then, too, officers from Bengal had skipped the meet. Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee last week twice flagged her grievances against the proposed change of norms of services of IAS officers for which she wrote twice to the PM. On Saturday, Modi held discussions with the DMs on the implementation of key government schemes. He tweeted: “One of the key factors behind the success of the aspirational districts programme is convergence. When the aspirations of others become your aspirations and when fulfilling the dreams of others becomes the measure of your success, then that path of duty creates history. Today, aspirational districts are eliminating the barriers of progress in the country. They are becoming an accelerator instead of an obstacle.” Modi urged the DMs to set 10 goals that could be achieved within the next three months. However, Trinamool Congress MP Saugata Roy described the move to connect with the DMs as one that “will weaken the federal structure of the country”. He criticised the attempt of speaking to the DMs in the name of accelerating projects without the CM or the chief secretary as an autocratic move. “Because the DMs work under the state government and are under the direct control of the CM and the CS, any attempt of grabbing power is unwanted. For this reason, Bengal DMs did not attend the meeting,” Roy said. PCC chief Adhir Ranjan Choudhury said: “BJP is trying to weaken the federal structure of India by all means and now the PM wants to bypass the CM and connect with the DMs, though the DMs work under the state government. Again, in the name of change of service rules of all-India service officers, the Centre is trying to centralise all powers in their hands, which is unjustified. The BJP is trying to ensure one nation one administration, breaking the federal set-up.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/dms-from-bengal-skip-virtual-meet-with-pm/articleshow/89066679.cms||Debashis Konar

The solo ride by Sadanand Amarapur, assistant director in the RDPR department, had twin themes: celebrate the 75th year of India’s Independence, and spread a message against addiction. All through the ride, Sadanand propagated his department’s flagship project Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA).

---||Hubballi||Covid patients isolated at home to have medicines delivered at their doorstep||Hubballi: The steep spike in the number of Covid-19 cases in Dharwad district notwithstanding, majority of those infected are either displaying no symptoms, or exhibiting very mild ones. Consequently, most Covid patients in the district are quarantined at home. Although this has reduced the load on all designated Covid hospitals in the district, the health department is grappling with the logistical problem of ensuring adequate medical care for those quarantined at home. Now, the district administration has launched, in collaboration with local bodies including the Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation (HDMC), a round-the-clock service wherein medicines will be supplied to Covid patients at their doorstep. Dharwad deputy commissioner Nitesh Patil pointed out that, though the number of cases being reported daily had jumped to three digits, the percentage of those being hospitalised was less. “Nearly 95% of those infected with Covid are quarantined at homes. There is the chance that patients quarantined at home cannot step out to purchase medicines. To ensure they have all they need at home, we have decided to deliver medicines to their homes across the district,” Patil told TOI. He added that HDMC, in addition to setting up a helpline that patients can call seeking help, had deployed staff to deliver medicines to patients’ homes. Patil said, “The helpline is to ensure that there is no delay in delivering the medicines. HDMC zonal officers will arrange for delivery of medicines in wards under their jurisdiction, while in the rural areas, medicines will be available at primary health centres and taluk health centres.” Affirming that all PHCs and taluk hospitals had been supplied with sufficient medicines, the DC said that they had hired 30 vehicles for delivering medicines to homes. HDMC commissioner Gopal Krishna said that people could call the following numbers for medicines, enquire about beds, et al: 0836-2213803; 0836-2213806; 91410151611. Nitesh Patil said that 20 medical students from SDM Medical College, and 25 at the Karnataka Institute of Medical Sciences would be enlisted to help the district administration monitor those quarantined at home, starting Monday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/covid-patients-isolated-at-home-to-have-medicines-delivered-at-their-doorstep/articleshow/89065299.cms||Basavaraj Kattimani

The flagship theatre competition which is very popular among amateur theatre artistes was cancelled just three days before its scheduled start on January 15 at 20 centres across the state. Artistes across the state had condemned this decision as they had agreed to perform in theatres without audience too. Still, the competition was cancelled. On January 20, the artistes had a video conference with the director of cultural affairs Bibhishan Chawre, assistant director Shriram Pande, superintendent of theatre section Milind Birje, and others. The authorities agreed to consider the demand of the artistes. “We will review the Covid conditions by January 31 and positively announce the new schedule,” said Chawre. Theatre artistes in Nagpur, Nanded and many other centres had sent e-mails to the directorate of cultural affairs after the event was cancelled. One of the coordinators of the competition, Dinesh Kawde had arranged a virtual meeting of theatre artistes with the officials of the directorate of cultural affairs to sort out the matter. In Nagpur, 23 plays were selected for the competition and the schedule was also declared.

It has floated an expression of interest (EOI) inviting plans from interested bidders who will be coming up with their concepts for developing the area. “The lake is spread over 75 acres near Sector No. 20 in Mihan. We plan to make the spot a world-class tourist destination on par with the best ones in India. There would be hotels, club houses, restaurants, games, amusement park and other things for families. There would be walkways on the lake side where families can spend time in the evening,” MADC managing director Deepak Kapoor told TOI. According to him, the beautification of Dahegaon lake and its surroundings would be done on the public private partnership (PPP) basis. “Not only citizens will get a new tourist place to visit, the tourism will also bring long-term revenue to MADC. Moreover, many employment opportunities will be created for local youths. We are expediting the project so that the people coming to Mihan will have a place to relax with their families,” he said. Kapoor, who is also the MADC vice-chairman, had recently reviewed the project. “We have received an excellent response from the prospective bidders. We are inviting them for further briefing shortly,” he said. Officials from MADC added that the bidders were told to come up with a presentation of their plans to develop the entire area around the lake bank. “After their presentation, we will invite tenders and allot them. Since the area comes under Zudpi jungle, even adventure activities could be provided for tourists. Our aim is to provide a destination which tourists from across the globe can visit. There will also be top class resorts. We have extended the time for EOI as we are still receiving queries from interested bidders,” they said.

Bhopal based senior psychiatrist Dr Satyakant Trivedi said that parents should keep their children in different learning skills as the schools are closed. It has been almost 2 years that schools have been running mostly through online classes only. Dr Trivedi said that online classes are limited to academics only. “Schools are not meant for academics only. They teach competition also. Students learn decision making and several other skills which are missing in online classes,” said Dr Trivedi. He added, “However, keeping the schools closed is indeed a need as the Covid is rising exponentially. Instead of blaming the situation, I think it would be better for the parents to involve their children in other learning skills which could be possible at home also.” He suggested that interaction with the kid is one of the ways to know what a child is missing in his life. “Parents should keep interacting with their children. They should do those activities which they want to do at home. Online classes can’t do all this,” said Dr Trivedi. After the recent rise in Covid cases, schools have been declared shut till January 31. Three guidelines have been issued in the past one month by the home department. In the last guideline, it was decided to allow schools to run at 50% strength. Even the pre-board exams which began from January 20 are being organised on ‘take home’ concept. Under this concept, students collect the question paper answer-sheets from schools and they will have to submit after writing the answers in the stipulated time.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/closed-campuses-to-have-long-term-impact-on-kids/articleshow/89066711.cms||Ramendra Singh

The hospitalisation on normal beds has also increased from 465 to 508 in the same period.

---||Bhopal||Scindia followers humiliating ‘original’ BJP workers: KP Yadav||Bhopal: A letter written to BJP national president J P Nadda by party MP from Guna Krishnapal Singh Yadav has triggered ripples in the saffron camp.Yadav has alleged that ‘original workers’ of BJP are being neglected and humiliated by Union minister Jyotiraditya Scindia’s supporters in the Gwalior-Chambal region. The letter is dated December 8, 2021, but has surfaced now. The BJP leadership is tightlipped about it.Yadav was a close aide of Scindia before joining BJP ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, and defeated Scindia in Guna. Yadav has alleged that Scindia’s supporters, including ministers in the Shivraj Singh Chouhan cabinet, are “flouting protocol, and neglecting original BJP workers of Gwalior-Chambal while displaying their dedication to an individual and not the party”. By ministers, he means the MLAs who left Congress in March 2020,followed Scindia into the saffron camp and are now members of the Shivraj cabinet. The MP says office-bearers of the Scindia faction ‘boycott’ meetings he organises. “When Scindia supporter ministers and leaders organize party and government functions, they do not invite me or any other dedicated party workers. Party workers are constantly being neglected,” Yadav wrote to Nadda. Scindia’s followers do not even give space to senior BJP workers on posters and banners, he has alleged.Yadav says he is not given his place defined by protocol although many of the projects have been approved under central schemes after his efforts. “Administrative officers and government employees are also under some misconception and neglecting BJP party workers,” he writes.“Original BJP workers are dejected and demoralized as police and administration disregard and torment them,” Yadav’s letter accuses. “This is a serious matter. The message being sent thus to Guna, Ashokenagar and Shivpuri districts and Gwalior-Chambal region is not right,” he writes.It has given rise to faction politics, which is helping other parties flourish, he says. “Former CM Digvijaya Singh keeps a close watch on this constituency and he is getting active. Party unity should be displayed at all functions and events,” the letter says “If this dispute isn’t resolved quickly, then dedication towards the party will end, while devotion toward an individual will grow and it will take decades to correct this,” he warns.The state BJP refused to comment but Congress seized the opportunity to attack the ruling party. PCC spokesman Narendra Saluja said, “Lust for power has made BJP bury its principles and policies. This is why its leaders and workers are being insulted every day. Just to form a government, BJP brought over those people, who never believed in the party’s ideology, organization or way of functioning. CM Chouhan and V D Sharma should clarify who they stand with now — KP Singh Yadav or Jyotiraditya Scindia.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/scindia-followers-humiliating-original-bjp-workers-kp-yadav/articleshow/89066729.cms||---

---||Bhopal||Vehicle thefts on rise, 72 vulnerable spots in Bhopal||BHOPAL: Vehicle theft cases continue to rise since the start of the first month this year and it seems that even the newly- implemented police Commissionerate system has made no difference. As many as 94 vehicle theft cases have been reported this month till January 21. It means more than four vehicles were stolen from the city every day on average. Last year, more than 1300 vehicle theft cases were reported at various police stations in the city. City police and crime branch have nabbed many vehicle lifters in the recent past, but still, vehicle theft cases are being reported on a daily basis. Police have identified 72 spots across the city that can be termed as vehicle lifting hotspots or vehicle theft prone areas from. Police have started verification of vehicles parked at various parking lots in the city because, in many cases, cops found that vehicle lifters park the stolen vehicles in such spots for a few days or months and then dispose them of. Senior cops are hopeful that the new ‘Face Forensic App’ and other measures will help in controlling these cases effectively. Shubham Singh, a 21-year-old engineering student, who hails from Jalaun district in Uttar Pradesh and resides here on rent at Karamveer Nagar in Piplani, had the shock of his life on January 21 after his bike was stolen from outside his rented room. He told police that he brought his tiffin around 1.30pm and parking the bike outside his room. Around 15-20 minutes later, he was shocked to find his bike missing from the spot. This is just one instance. Piplani has many vehicle theft hotspots in Ratnagiri and Indrapuri areas. Apart from BHEL area in Piplani, Govindpura and Awadhpuri too have many such vehicle theft hotspots. AIIMS hospital in Bagsewania, Sultania hospital parking in Talaiya, Private hospital parking slots in front of Taj-ul-Masajid in Shahjehanabad and Hamidia hospital parking slot in Koh-e-Fiza have been identified as vehicle theft hotspots as well. Vindhyachal Bhawan parking in the highly secured VIP Zone near Mantralaya has emerged as a vehicle lifting hotspot along with the city’s commercial hub MP Nagar Zone-1 and Zone-2 and the district court parking. DCP crime branch Amit Kumar said that police have already identified vehicle theft hotspots and were working on a strategy to bring down the cases. Special checkpoints are being set up on the city outskirts on roads entering the city, where the cops verify the suspects with the help of ‘Face Forensic App’ on their smartphones so as to keep a tab on the entry of vehicle lifters in the city. The traffic cops and city cops deployed on checkpoints check vehicles with VDP Portals to verify if they are stolen. Beat patrolling is being strengthened especially in the areas which are prone to vehicle theft cases. CCTV cameras are being installed at strategic locations.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/vehicle-thefts-on-rise-72-vulnerable-spots-in-bhopal/articleshow/89066737.cms||Sudeept Mishra

In its latest meeting, KCZMA considered the agenda on a joint inspection report on CRZ violations in Akkulam backwaters and surroundings. While the joint site inspection was conducted in September 2020, KCZMA received the inspection report via mail from the district collector nearly a year later, in December 2021. Records show that the inspection report was filed by September 30, 2020.The joint committee comprised officers from tourism planning, revenue, survey and hand records inland navigation and KCZMA. It was constituted for conducting site inspection for further scrutiny of the complaints received before the coastal district committee constituted as per the direction of the Supreme Court regarding the CRZ violations near the Akkulam lake and nearby places.In order to determine the HTL (high tide line) accurately, KCZMA was requested to depute an officer with technical knowledge and an officer was deputed accordingly and subsequently the joint inspection was conducted in 2020. As per the inspection report, 10 violations were reported by the KCZMA member, which include constructions by both government departments and private parties.While the report mentions that it was the collector who had directed to complete the site inspection without any delay after the matter came up in the district committee meeting, the reason why the report took so long to be sent to KCZMA is unknown. Sanjeev S J, president, Environmental Protection and Research Council who had raised the issue of CRZ violations around Akkulam lake said that the district administration had always turned a blind eye towards the violations. “Despite flagging instances of blatant violations, the district administration seldom acted. Even this report which was filed on an emergency basis took two years to be brought to the public domain. It is this delay which often leads to violations being regularised,” said Sanjeev S J.The coastal district committee constituted to identify CRZ (coastal regulation zone) violations in the district following the Supreme Court order had identified a total of 3,535 constructions built in violation of norms. Amongst urban local bodies, the highest number of violations was reported from Varkala – 233, while Karumkulam gram panchayat recorded the highest number of violations in the district amongst 26 local bodies where CRZ norms are applicable – 1,964. The list was compiled based on three interim reports. A total of 573 violations were reported in the first interim report submitted to the Chief Secretary on October 31, 2019. The second interim report was submitted in November and it included 3,228 violations.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/crz-violations-kczma-to-wait-for-apex-court-order/articleshow/89066738.cms||Aswin J Kumar

Pradeep Burman, 32, hailing from Bihar, is the deceased. His decapitated body was found on the railway track around 10.45 pm on Friday.

The body was found by his brother and other house inmates, who went in search of him after Burman failed to return home on time. The police also said that it could either be a case of accidental death or suicide. Guest labourers residing near railway tracks often go out and sit on the railway track and talk to their families over phone. Another guest labourer, James Oran, 39, hailing from West Bengal, had died in September last year at Stationkadavu under Thumba police station limits, in a similar fashion.“However, we also suspect that it could be a case of suicide. His brother has told us that he was visibly upset for the past two weeks after sustaining an injury on his arm following an accident, rendering him temporarily unable to go for work,’’ said Thumba station house officer inspector R Sivakumar. The Covid screening test and post mortem examination will be conducted on Sunday following which the body will be handed over to the family.

Police have identified the accused as Sanith M S of Madavoorpara near Pallichal.The police said that Sanith was arrested based on a complaint filed by a woman who alleged that she lost gold ornaments weighing around 18 sovereigns after falling victim to his trap. According to her complaint, she contacted the accused after coming across an advertisement offering jobs, which he had placed on OLX. Though he offered her a job, he asked her to wait as his office was undergoing renovation works. Gradually, he developed a relationship with the women and asked her help to carry out automation works in the office. She agreed to give her ornaments as she did not have money. He told her that his agent would meet her to collect the ornaments.''The complainant had never met the accused in person. He was using someone else's photograph as a display picture on his Whatsapp. He himself turned up before her pretending as the agent and received the ornaments. She realised this fraud much later,” said city cyber station DSP T Syamlal.He is also alleged to have trapped many others using the same modus operandi. Police said the accused was a habitual offender who was declared wanted by Nedumangad magistrate court after he escaped from police custody from the court premises in 2017.

The seventh-semester engineering exam in colleges affiliated to the university is set to begin next week. Covid-infected students can take exams of various programmes if the viral infection has not taken a serious toll on their health and if they are willing to write the exam. Respective colleges have been instructed to make special arrangements for the infected students to appear for the exam. The university has instructed both the colleges and individual students to strictly follow Covid protocol. Students who turn Covid-positive are expected to inform their exam centres and their intention to appear for the exam on the campus. Colleges have been asked to prepare separate exam halls for Covid-positive students. To manage the conduct of exams amidst the Covid surge across the state, university authorities instructed a mechanism as per which candidates can choose an exam centre of their choice, preferably near their homes. Amidst the call for indefinite postponement and cancellation of offline exams during the pandemic, the university last year set up a similar mechanism for Covid-positive students. “Though there was a hue and cry about the university conducting exams for Covid-positive students, a large number of infected students took the examination last year. Those who are very sick and down with the viral infection can appear for the supplementary exam that will follow in a gap of a few months. Their appearance in supplementary exams would be considered as the first appearance by the university,” said S Ayoob, pro-vice-chancellor, KTU. According to university authorities, a majority of students who turn Covid-positive remain asymptomatic with comparatively lesser health problems.  “A majority of them are fit to appear for the exams,” said the principal of a government college. However, the college union elections held in engineering colleges early this month led to the formation of Covid clusters in several engineering colleges, especially in the government and aided sector, causing worry for college authorities and students.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/covid-ve-students-can-appear-for-engg-exam/articleshow/89066749.cms||B S Anilkumar

This is the fourth consecutive time that he is becoming the state president of the Congress trade union.It was in 2007 that Chandrasekharan came at the helm of the trade union and he became the president for the first time through nomination.In the elections held to the post in 2012 and 2016, he was re-elected as the president of INTUC.According to returning officer V R Jaganath, all the 14 district committees had submitted the nominations of Chandrasekharan for the president’s post. However, another set of nomination of K K Dharmarajan was also submitted for the post. On scrutiny, Dharmarajan’s nomination was rejected and this led to the election of Chandrasekharan as unopposed.This election was scheduled in March 2020 and the election process could not be completed due to the pandemic situation in the state. However, there were criticism against the conduct of the election at a time when the state is witnessing surge in Covid-19 cases.“The election to the state committee of INTUC has been conducted in such a way that any organizations, including KPCC, can emulate such election process,’’ said Chandrasekharan after the election. He said his top priority would be to go strong against the anti-labour policies and the move to disinvest the public sector undertakings by the Centre.INTUC will be a force in the state which will flay and protest against any anti-labour policies promoted by any government.

As many as 18,78,884 lakh devotees used the virtual queue facility this season, that includes 16,73,836 lakh who booked it from various outstation centres while 2,05,048 lakh used spot booking facilities that were opened in various major spots en route to Sabarimala. The number is the all-time highest in any season ever since the virtual queue booking system was launched for Sabarimala darshan. The police had opened as many as 15 spot booking counters that include five at Nilackal and one each in Kottarakkara (Kollam rural), Sreekandeswaram (Thiruvananthapuram), Pandalam (Pathanamthitta), Kumali (Idukki), Erumeli (Kottayam), Ettumannoor (Kottayam), Vaikom (Kottayam), Perumbavoor (Ernakulam rural), Keezhillam (Ernakulam rural) and Moozhikkal (Idukki). Those who had come without virtual queue booking ticket had used these spot booking facilities, Nilackal being the mostly used spot booking counter from where as many as 1,18,334 devotees obtained the spot tickets for darshan, followed by Erumeli (35,728) and Kottarakkara (20,880). Police had opened 35,000 darshan slots from November 16, the day when the temple opened to the devotees for darshan, till November 30. From December 1, the slots were increased to 45,000 till December 20, after which it was increased to 50,000 till the end of the pilgrimage season. As per the figures, on an average, 78.17% who booked through the virtual queue (including the spot booking) visited the temple. “The biggest advantage was that the slots were even for all the days, and for the same reason, the management of pilgrims was smooth. In earlier seasons, on a peak day, the number of devotees used to touch 1,20,000 per day, while one lean days, it used to drop below 30,000. This uneven pattern was causing difficulties on peak days. With the government deciding to allow darshan only through virtual queue this year owing to Covid-19, the management was smooth and all those who visited were ensured good darshan,” a top police officer said. The Sabarimala Pilgrim Management System (SPMS) was made functional during the 2019-20 festival season. The SPMS had three stakeholders – the state police maintaining the virtual queue, Travancore devaswom to take care of devaswom-related matters, including taking online bookings of appam and aravana, vibhoothi booking, online accommodation, pooja, e- kanikka services, etc. and the KSRTC offering online booking of long-distance and Nilakkal-Pamba shuttle service tickets.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/sabarimala-virtual-queue-turns-out-to-be-big-success/articleshow/89066752.cms||KP Saikiran

Patel had enquired about the solar power project from one Prashant Survay in March 2016. On Survay’s insistence, Patel had come to Survay’s office in Navrangpura after which Patel was introduced to another accused named Parag Shukla. Shukla told Patel that there was a firm named Raise Power Private Limited in Barmer, Rajasthan, which was about to sign a deal to sell electricity to the government of Rajasthan. Shukla told Patel that the project cost was of around Rs 8 crore and if he pays Rs 1 crore initially, he would help him bag the project. Patel paid around Rs 1 crore to Shukla and Survey between August 2016 and January 2017.

---||Nagpur||Greens hope for Nashik-like step from Aaditya to save Ajni trees||Nagpur: Enthused by state environment minister Aadtiya Thackeray’s tweet on redesigning a flyover to save one heritage tree and 450 others in Nashik, greens say why can’t the same be done to several infrastructural projects in Nagpur, specifically at Ajni Vann where a large number of heritage trees, some more than 100-year-old are proposed to be felled. On Saturday, Thackeray, through his Twitter account, announced that he has asked the Nashik Municipal Corporation to re-work the design of a proposed flyover to save a 200-year-old banyan tree and more than 450 others. Lauding the “sustainable approach”, city environmentalists who have been fighting a nearly two-year-long battle to save trees at Ajni, have urged the policy-makers to adopt similar outlook here. As reported by TOI, thousands of trees are facing axe for the proposed inter-modal station (IMS). Stressing that alternatives are a must, architectural conservationist Sandip Pathe said that the government needs to re-think and shift the proposed IMS which is to come up at Ajni. “Khapri could be one of such alternative locations, which is appropriate for the building typology of IMS. Finding such alternatives is not just sustainable but also sensible when we are talking about hundreds of acre of land to be used for public projects, which are funded by taxpayers. Shifting such projects is a win-win situation for citizens and planners — on one hand we save thousands of trees and on the other hand we achieve new developments too,” said Pathe. Like the 200-year-old tree in Nashik, there are various heritage trees in the urban forest of Ajni Vann that need to be conserved. Environmentalist and tree expert Prachi Mahurkar said, “The environment minister’s initiative shows that modifications are possible in developmental projects to protect the green cover. There are various age-old trees at Ajni, some being more than 100-year-old. It will be an irreplaceable loss if they are chopped down.” Citing the recently amended Maharashtra (Urban Areas) Protection and Preservation of Trees Act, 1975, activists have appealed to Thackeray to intervene in the matter on an urgent basis. “The heritage neem, peepal and various other trees are home to a thriving biodiversity as well as have immense potential in tackling the increasing climate change crisis. The state should bring a halt to the IMS and ensure that it is shifted to some other site,” they said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/greens-hope-for-nashik-like-step-from-aaditya-to-save-ajni-trees/articleshow/89065708.cms||Manka Behl
---||Delhi||Delhi: Woman found dead, husband under lens||NEW DELHI: A 52-year-old woman was allegedly killed by her husband in south Delhi's Saket on Friday evening. Police said the couple often argued over the house, which the husband wanted to sell over his wife’s protests. It is likely that one such argument led to the killing, police officers said.  Police got a call from Kapil Pandey, 42, nephew of the accused, Chander Mohan Pandey, 57, who reported that his uncle had killed his wife, Shashi Lata Pandey. The police team found the woman lying on the bedroom floor on the first storey of the house. She had no visible injury marks on her body.  Kapil, who lives on the ground floor of the same building with his family, told the cops that his aunt called from Indirapuram, Ghaziabad, around 6pm on Friday saying she learnt that Chander Mohan and Shashi were having a heated argument. “She asked Kapil to go and check,” saida police officer.  The officer said that when Kapil knocked on the door, his uncle opened it. "Kapil told us his clothes had blood stains. He also had a cut on the left side of his neck. He then asked his nephew to call the cops and inform them about the death," the officer said. Benita Mary Jaiker, DCP (South), said, “Kapil Pandey called an ambulance. While the woman was declared dead, Chander Mohan was shifted to Max Hospital and is under treatment. His statement hasn’t been recorded as he is not medically fit.”  A case has been registered under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code for murder and investigation is under way. Jaiker said a crime and forensics team inspected the spot and found a blood-stained kitchen knife in the drawing room. Police, however, are yet to establish the sequence of incidents.  "Since the woman had no injury on her body, it is probable that she was strangled by her husband. The man might have injured himself while trying to attack her or might have got injured during a scuffle,” said an officer.  During the probe, police learnt of the problem related to the house. “While the man wanted to sell it, his wife wanted to stay on," the officer revealed. Chander Mohan was a front office executive at a hotel in Connaught Place but was unemployed for the past two years, police said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/woman-found-dead-husband-under-lens/articleshow/89065798.cms||---

The couple involved in this divorce proceedings married on December 8, 2020. They separated on December 20, 2020. They pressed for criminal charges against each other as well. On October 18, 2021, they prepared an MoU for mutual divorce and decided to withdraw the criminal allegations. With the MoU, the couple approached the family court for a divorce decree and requested the court to suspend the mandatory cooling-off period of six months. The courts normally use that period to explore opportunities for reconciliation between couples. Looking at the short marriage span and the separation period of less than a year, the family court sent their case for mediation for reconciliation. However, on December 31, 2021, a report was submitted stating that the mediation effort had failed. The family court on January 4 rejected the application to waive the cooling-off period. In rejecting the request, the family court cited a Supreme Court order. The apex court had waived such a cooling-off period by using its powers under Article 142 of the Constitution in Section 13B(2) of the Hindu Marriage Act. The family court said that it does not have this power. The family court said the Supreme Court has observed that for waiving the cooling-off period, the court has to look into such factors as the length of time of the marriage and a couple’s stay together. The Supreme Court also wanted the consideration of the duration of separation and the possibility of reconciliation. The couple approached the high court citing its powers under Article 227 of the Constitution and submitted that the family court had erred in not appreciating that the provisions of Section 13B(2) are discretionary and not mandatory. Justice A C Joshi heard the case on January 19 and upheld the lower court’s decision of not waiving the cooling-off period. The HC said that its powers under Article 227 can be used only sparingly. It said: “An improper and a frequent exercise of this power would be counterproductive and will divest this extraordinary power of its strength and vitality.” The court added: “The power is discretionary and has to be exercised very sparingly on equitable principle.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/12-day-marriage-cooling-off-time-upheld/articleshow/89066768.cms||---

The victims are a couple, a 12-year-old girl, and a 3-year-old boy. The deaths came to light when a larger group — believed to be consisting of Gujaratis — was apprehended by a border patrol on the American side. After the news broke on international wires late on Friday, Gujarat authorities started searching for the family’s roots in the state. While no official word was out till Saturday evening, sources aware of developments said the family is thought to be from a village near Kalol in Gandhinagar.Sources said that the deceased man’s parents still live in the village. The person was earlier in a private job and later took to the readymade garment business. However, none of the details could be confirmed through local officials. The people of the village in question said that a team of police had paid a visit. But, the people said, they are yet to know the details of the investigation. “We are keeping updated through news outlets in the US and Canada,” said a local resident. “Those who have been apprehended may be able to give some details.” The resident added that over the past few years, there has been a steady stream of villagers aspiring to settle in the US and surviving with the help of the larger community on the foreign shores. Meanwhile, the Gujarati community in Canada was in shock. Community leaders said that due to stringent local laws, the identities of the deceased are not known yet, but they are believed to be Patels from north Gujarat. “It is possible that the group came to Canada on visitors’ visas and might have planned illegal entry into the US,” said a community member. “The details emerging at the moment indicate that there were more families and 2-3 students in the larger group that had started off from Canada.” The member added: “We have offered our services to the consulate to perform the last rites and to send the mortal remains to their native place.” The extreme weather is unforgiving even for the locals who seldom venture out in these conditions. “But those managing the crossing might have thought it the perfect time for the passage to the US,” said another member of the Gujarati Canadian community. “Illegal crossings are common in summer, but this was suicidal. If the details are true, apart from the four deaths, a few members who have been caught needed amputation due to severe frost bite.” The horror tales emerged from the investigation of the border forces who learnt that the larger group was walking for about 11 hours in -35°C. A storm set the four apart from the rest of the group. They were expected to be picked up near the border. The bodies were found just metres from the US border.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/4-die-on-canada-us-border-shivers-in-guj/articleshow/89066770.cms||---

The decision allowing 24-hour delivery is well-received by most restaurateurs as students, IT professionals, and resident doctors among others, tend to order in food. However, implementation poses a problem. Dilip Thakkar, an Ahmedabad-based restaurateur said, “We will not start round the clock delivery just yet. Even though the state government has made this announcement, there is no clarity on part of the police department on how restaurant staff will be allowed to move during curfew hours. Once the guidelines come in, we will consider what can be done.” Estimates by restaurateurs suggest that 85% of their revenues come from dine-ins especially during evening hours. However, most restaurants are currently dependent on delivery due to the night curfew. With curfew coming into force at 10pm, they are compelled to shut shop by 9.30pm. Rushad Jinwala, another Ahmedabad-based restaurateur said, “With curfew in place, it makes no sense to carry out deliveries round the clock. Once the police department issues guidelines, we may continue delivery up to 11pm. Many a time, even delivery personnel are not available. They tend to panic and not pick up orders. That not just adds to our food wastage but also to the cost of operations that restaurants incur.” Hotels and Restaurants’ Association (HRA) –Gujarat is set to make a representation before the state police department regarding the guidelines, said Narendra Somani, president of the association.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/clarify-curfew-rules-for-food-delivery/articleshow/89066771.cms||---

On February 8, it will select an operator to manage its water supply operations and provide cyberattack cover to its water supply network. The AMC will spend a little over Rs 7 crore for the project. The AMC’s supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) for regulating water supply is still in the nascent stage. “We fear cyberattacks on crucial operations of water supply management. Attempts to raise levels of cleaning agent or chlorine gas to a dangerous degree or altering the pH values of water supply can have grave consequences,” says a senior AMC official. Among the major operations that is being outsourced are repair and maintenance of level transmitters, water flow transmitters, water pressure transmitters, analyzers, energy meters, and maintenance of SCADA operations for water supply, including that of three water distribution systems, treatment plants and four French wells. Among the critical operations that will be handled include chlorine-pH, turbidity analyzers and alert any multifunction of any flow meter with valves. “SCADA systems have been attacked in the past and one has to draw a clear distinction between IT and operation technology (OT) in this vulnerability. We have to ensure that we don’t use the same routers and communication network for IT applications,” says a senior AMC official. He added that with more centralization of water resources, the state government is also planning on a central command and control system for equitable water supply across major nagarpalikas and municipal corporations.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/amc-seeks-cybersecurity-for-water-supply-network/articleshow/89066775.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Complaint against 3 for Rs 27.9 lakh bogus insurance claims||AHMEDABAD: A senior manager of a medical insurance company has filed a complaint with Navrangpura police stating that three people had produced forged bills to make three different claims amounting to Rs 27.9 lakh. He said all the bills were from a Bapunagar hospital. The complainant is Santosh Gange of the medical insurance company based in Mumbai. He filed the complaint on Friday. He said that his company has a branch on CG Road. Gange stated that in 2021 Nirajkumar Patel, a resident of Surendranagar, had taken a policy from his company. Gange said in the FIR that Patel was admitted to Apollo Prime Multispecialty Hospital in Bapunagar for Covid-19 treatment between May 3 and May 8 last year. That year, according to Patel’s claims, he was again admitted to the same hospital between May 18 and May 19. Later, a claim was submitted with hospital documents. In the first claim, the amount was Rs 6.53 lakh while in the other, it was Rs 2.97 lakh. Gange said that the bills were sent for investigation and when his company’s officials went to the pharmacy of the hospital for verification they were denied the bills. He said a lab called White Cross also refused to share the relevant reports for verification. The claim was rejected and nothing was paid to Patel. Meanwhile the company found that Pranay Bhatt, a resident of Nikol, had also taken treatment for a lung infection at the same hospital. Bhatt had forwarded a claim of Rs 5.07 lakh for himself and Rs 13.33 lakh for his wife Anita for Covid treatment. Gange said that Bhatt made online payments for himself and his wife. Gange said that the pharmacy and the laboratory once again refused to cooperate in the verification process. The insurance company has issued a show-cause notice to Bhatt. However, the company made the payment to the Bhatts before the verification protocols were complete. Because of the lapse, the company has incurred a loss of Rs 18.33 lakh. Navrangpura police have registered a case against the Bhatts and Patel. Police have invoked the Indian Penal Code’s sections 465 (forgery), 467 (forgery of valuable security), 468 (forgery for the purpose of cheating), and 471 (using a forged document as genuine).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/plaint-against-3-for-27-9l-bogus-insurance-claims/articleshow/89066779.cms||---

Addressing a briefing, Congress spokesperson Manish Doshi said that against a requirement of 1,392 super specialist doctors in government hospitals, there is a deficit of 1,379 doctors. “The Congress has repeatedly made the demand to fill up vacant posts of doctors and other medical personnel in hospitals, but the government has failed to do so,” Doshi said. He added that the government has been outsourcing most jobs in the health department, benefiting agencies close to BJP leaders. “The health department is turning out to be an epicentre of corruption because of this practice,” Doshi said. He added that not just super specialists, there have been huge vacancies of medical personnel in civil hospitals, district hospitals, CHCs and PHCs.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/govt-lethargy-led-to-deficit-of-docs-cong/articleshow/89066781.cms||---

On November 14 last year, Deshmukh was assaulted with an iron rod by one Kunal Sapre after a road rage incident, injuring him seriously. The lawyer was soon rushed to a nearby hospital. Later, he lodged a complaint in the Awadhootwadi police station. The police booked Sapre under Sections 307, 341, 294 and 506 of the Indian Penal Code. The accused moved an application before the district and sessions court and upon hearing, the court denied bail to Sapre. He then approached the high court (HC), which rejected the application on December 1. The HC rejected the interim anticipatory bail plea on December 14. The court has finally ordered the police to recover the weapons used for the assault on January 14. However, the police failed to nab the accused.

But Andhra University could not offer these manuscripts to researchers due to their fragile nature. However, this would soon become a thing of the past as the university has started digitising the nearly 2,100 palm-leaf manuscripts and 560 paper manuscripts available at its Dr VS Krishna Library. From Vedas, philosophy, literature and theology to codes of law and history, medicine, culture and religious texts, these manuscripts offer an important link to ancient knowledge and wisdom. Library to complete digitisation in a year, make them accessible to publicF or instance, the Sumati Satakam written by Baddena Bhupaludu from the 13th century touches upon the value system and right conduct. The ‘Andhra Maha Bhagavatam’ engraved on palm leaves, which is considered the jewel of Telugu literature and dates back to the 15th century, is also available at this library. A few chapters of Andhra Mahabharatam written by Tikkana Somayaji from the 13th century is one of the prized possessions of this library in the form of palm-leaf manuscript, which is said to be one of the oldest media of writing. From ‘Tiruppavai Vyakarnam’ and ‘Parashar Smriti’ to ‘Dinakara Tarangini’ and Chanakya's Arthashastra, these manuscripts at this library were written in various languages such as Sanskrit, Telugu, Tamil, Pali, Prakrit, etc. The 93-year-old Dr VS Krishna Library has entrusted this digitisation responsibility to a Bangalore-based publishing house. When ToI visited the Library on Friday, the digitisation team was seen diligently cleaning and scanning the palm-leaf manuscripts to convert them into digital format. Speaking to ToI, Andhra University vice-chancellor Prof PVGD Prasad Reddy said that the digitisation process will not only help preserve these priceless, rare manuscripts, but it would also help transfer the rich corpus of knowledge, science and literature to the future generations. Honorary librarian, Dr VS Krishna Library, Prof P Venkateswarlu, explained how they have conserved the palm-leaf manuscripts through various indigenous methods over the years before the initiation of the project. “Wrapping, storing them in specially designed boxes, and applying extracts of natural products extended the life of these manuscripts. Earlier, we conducted a workshop by an expert team on conservation of these manuscripts,” said Prof P Venkateswarlu. “We will complete the digitisation process in a year. We are planning to make them accessible to even the general public,” said Prof Venkateswarlu.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/andhra-university-embarks-on-digitising-rare-ancient-manuscripts/articleshow/89066786.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

In the initial weeks of the first wave in 2020, the door-to-door survey mechanism was leveraged to identify foreign returnees and people having a travel history to other states. This was done as the initial Covid-19 cases were identified among the foreign returnees before community transmission started in Andhra Pradesh.  Later, the door-to-door survey was repurposed to identify suspected cases as this would help in timely testing, detection, and prevent further transmission. The comprehensive door-to-door surveys in the first wave identified nearly 32,700 suspected cases and the state subjected all of them to Covid-19 testing. The surveys conducted in the second wave recognised about 1.6 lakh suspected cases.  According to the officials, all the symptomatic patients are given home isolation kits. Moreover, Covid-19 samples will be collected from these persons for testing.  Andhra Pradesh is probably the first state in the country to conduct these many rounds of fever surveys for Covid-19 pandemic. The huge ward/village volunteer network, ANMs and Asha workers are the biggest advantage for the state to conduct any household survey. State Covid-19 nodal officer and director, Visakha Institute of Medical Sciences, Dr K Rambabu, said the fever surveys are essential to single out the suspected cases. “It will help in early identification and testing of suspected Covid-19 cases and timely treatment. Continuous and effective surveillance activities are crucial to mitigate the impact of the pandemic,” said Dr Rambabu.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/aps-35th-fever-survey-pinpoints-nearly-13k-suspected-cases-till-date/articleshow/89066789.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

---||Amaravati||Andhra Pradesh: Omicron makes up close to 90% of sequenced samples||VISAKHAPATNAM: The new Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant of the novel coronavirus seems to be dominating the ongoing third wave of Covid-19 in Andhra Pradesh. About 85 to 90% of the total samples sequenced in the recent weeks belong to this lineage, which is said to be more transmissible than the earlier forms of the virus.  Officials attribute the high transmissibility and the immune evading behaviour of this variant to the sudden surge in the cases. Within three weeks into the third wave, the daily case positivity rate crossed the peak of the second wave.  Before Omicron, it was virulent Delta (B.1.617.2) that dominated the second wave. As per the available statistics, the change in the landscape of variants of concern might have begun as early as in April 2021. The Delta variant was found in only 2% of the total sequenced samples in March 2021 in Andhra Pradesh. But the share of Delta cases found in the samples sequenced in April increased to 40% and consequently to 91% in May. Even though the first case of Delta variant was reported back in October 2020 in India, it was detected only in March 2021 in Andhra Pradesh in genome sequencing. State Covid-19 nodal officer Dr K Rambabu said that whenever a new variant is found, it ideally goes through four stages – VBM (variant being monitored), VOI (variant of interest), VOC (variant of concern), and VOHC (variant of high consequence). “But the B1.1.529 (Omicron) simply jumped the ladder for the World Health Organisation to label it as a VOC,” said Dr Rambabu. The Union ministry of health and family welfare established the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Consortium on Genomics (INSACOG), a grouping of 10 national laboratories, in December 2020. INSACOG has since been carrying out genomic sequencing and analysis of circulating Covid-19 viruses, and correlating epidemiological trends with genomic variants. As per the updated guidelines of the INSACOG on genomic surveillance for SARS-CoV-2, each state is to designate a nodal officer, who will be the focal point for coordination of whole genome sequencing.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/amaravati/omicron-makes-up-close-to-90-of-sequenced-samples/articleshow/89069704.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Due to heavy rains in winter and unfavourable climatic conditions in parts of the state, the flowering has been delayed by over one month, and this has impacted the fruit bearing to some extent. Krishna and Vizianagaram are home to some of the best mango varieties (Banginapalli, Chinna Rasalu and Suvarnarekha ) in the country. Assistant director, horticulture, Nuziveedu, Krishna district, J Jyothi, said the delay in the flowering of mango trees may lead to maturity of the fruits at a time so that mango growers may not get the best price. “The prolonged rainy season and the extended winter has impacted the flowering. We are hoping for normal yield of mangoes in the coming season. If the spread of the virus decreases by April, mango farmers will get some good returns,” she said. Due to low night temperatures and unfavourable climatic conditions, flowering has been delayed in Vizianagaram district. But farmers need not worry as the flowering may be completed within two weeks. The yield may come down by around 10 per cent due to the delay in flowering, said deputy director, horticulture, Vizianagaram, R Srinivasa Rao. “The yield will be good if there are no rains and gales during the next couple of months. Strong winds and rain may affect the flowers and result in lesser yield,” Rao added. Weather and soil not perfect for Alphonso mangoes Banginapalli is the king of mangoes in south India whereas Alphonso mangoes are considered to be among the most superior varieties of the fruit in terms of sweetness, richness and flavour in north India. Though the horticulture department has planted Alphonso variety in parts of the state for experiment, they concluded that AP’s weather and soil conditions are not perfect for Alphonso mangoes production in the region. Deputy director, Horticulture, Vizianagaram, R Srinivasa Rao, said that diseases such as spongy tissue and blossom blight are being seen in Alphonso variety in the region. “We observed that humid weather in our region is not fit for the Alphonso variety. When compared to Alphonso, our Banginapalli is the best fruit,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/winter-rain-cold-weather-may-hit-mango-yield/articleshow/89066793.cms||Nalla.Babu

In a letter to BJP's national president JP Nadda, He alleged that there was a huge anti-incumbency against three party legislators including Kunwar Pranav Singh Champion but all three were entertained with the party's ticket. "Party, however, did not give the ticket to Champion but in his place, it is his wife to whom the party has given the ticket from same Khanpur constituency of Champion. The profile of Champion's wife is inferior to my wife's. Profile of Champion's wife is of the politics of Zila Panchayat, she is very newcomer in this fold whereas my wife has been doing a successful politics of Zila panchayat since 1995," underscored Karanwal in his letter, which is well preserved with TOI. Karanwal, a BJP legislator from Jhabreda-SC constituency, also stated that rumours were high in party circles that the party has now been considering allocating the party ticket to one of three whose names are emerging after him but none of them would succeed. "If the party can replace Champion with his wife then why does it not replace Karanwal with his wife whereas Karanwal has done remarkable development works more to other legislators in his constituency," said Satish Sharma, one of his supporters.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/after-being-rejected-bjp-legislator-demands-party-ticket-for-wife/articleshow/89064790.cms||Tapan Susheel

Even as their protest under the banner of Dhwaja Pahar Bachao Samiti entered the 66th day on Saturday, the state government and the local district administration have ignored their demands, the protesters said.According to the protesters, the mountain has come under immense stress because of illegal stone quarrying by the local mafia and despite numerous pleas before different authorities, no action has been taken up.A month later after they began their strike, several groups have extended support and since December 18, about 20 villagers on a rotational basis are taking up fast from dawn-to-dusk while others provided support by singing bhajans and kirtans to pursue their demand.Sanjay Paswan, the president of the protest group, accused the government of failing to safeguard the jal, jungle and jameen (water, forest and land), one of the major poll planks of the JMM-Congress-RJD mahagathbandhan for the 2019 assembly polls. Paswan said, “Dhwaja Pahar has been the source of water to a local river here and provided food to hundreds of cattle owners and is ecologically important for the environment. Many villagers also worship the trees and the mountains here as part of their nature worship tradition. However, rampant stone quarrying in the last couple of years is now threatening to convert this mountain into a molehill. How will we survive?”Jugal Pal, a supporter of the protest, said such rampant and illegal activities led to the demolition of 50 mountains in the Chatterpur block. “We won’t allow that to happen here,” he said, adding that the protesters are holding peaceful agitation by blocking the approach roads the mountains to stop the movement of trucks or tractors carrying stone chips. “Today is the 66th day of our protest and our fight will continue till our demands are met,” he said.According to Pal, a construction company and their contractors have got the lease for quarrying on a different plot but kept quarrying from the mountain in a clandestine manner. “During our recent scrutiny, it was found that the company had got the lease for plot number 1,046. This mountain is located on plot number 1,048. We want punitive action against the erring contractors, cancellation of their lease and strict measures to save the mountain,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/villagers-stir-to-save-palamu-mountain-enters-66th-day/articleshow/89066806.cms||ASRP Mukesh

The thieves, probably numbering two to four, taking advantage of the night, stole two tyres from a truck trailer parked on the premises, he said. “The trailer was parked at the police station after it met with an accident on Jan 14 night and was damaged,” Pawar said. “The CCTVs were working and we have footage. But, because of fog, it is not very clear. We are taking help of experts and other CCTVs in the area,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/indore/thieves-steal-tyres-from-police-station/articleshow/89066809.cms||Antriksh Singh

---||Indore||At over 20,000, active Covid cases in Indore are all-time high||Indore: Active cases on Friday night rose to over 20000, highest in the district since outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic on March 23 in 2020, shows record. The active cases tally rose to 20340 on Friday with detection of 3169 fresh infections. With this, the number crossed the 18067 active cases figures- highest recorded on May 12 during the second wave of pandemic, showed the bulletin record. The district however has a silver lining in this third wave surge is the very low rate of hospitalisation and fatalities because of lesser severity caused by Omicron variant causing surge in third wave. The hospitalisation figures stand at 193 only on Saturday. Interestingly this time around 99% Covid-19 infected ones are under home isolation. This type of surge was never witnessed before the third wave in pandemic MGMMC Dean Dr Sanjay Dixit termed it as the start of an endemic phase of disease. Dr Dixit told TOI, “The Covid-19 surge is reported because of a new variant of the virus. Because the new variant is spreading very fast it has lost its capability to cause severity.” “Epidemiologically, it is known as the start of an endemic phase of a disease. The disease has begun to become endemic that it will remain as any other disease”, said Dr Dixit. Last year, the second wave was such that the district authorities stopped home isolation because of severity and other things. Prior to that, for almost one year, around two-third of the Covid-19 infected ones in the district were treated under home isolation. Respiratory medicine HoD Dr Salil Bhargava told TOI, “It is a very good sign that hospitalisation rate is very low in this wave. Because of it, the beds reserved for pandemic infected patients are vacant.” “This helped in stopping the rush from resourceful persons infected with Covid-19 to occupy beds in hospitals this time. This phenomenon had further burdened the health infrastructure during the first and second wave that was reeling under pressure of a very high number of infections”, said Dr Bhargava. “This is all happening because of changes in behaviour of viruses, vaccination programmes, and the preparedness of the government. It also signifies that the disease might have begun to move into endemicity like any other virus like swine flu”, added Dr Bhargava.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/indore/at-over-20k-active-cases-in-indore-are-all-time-high/articleshow/89066811.cms||Antriksh Singh

Restoration of Rajwada palace is undertaken by Indore Smart City Development Limited, which was started around four years ago. Its deadline, which was earlier set to January 2021 and then was extended for next two months, has now been increased till June 2022.According to the experts, Rajwada palace was constructed during the reign of Malhar Rao Holkar between 1747 and 1766. The lower three floors of the seven-storied monument are made of stone and the upper floors made of wood. The walls made of brick and lime and the wooden brackets had undergone a lot of decay over the years. The structure suffered massive deterioration after fires broke out in 1801, 1837 and 1984. Waterlogging at Rajwada place’s roof for years further weakened the structure. The officials concerned are citing time taking in carving woods, replacing it with the rotten pillars, distributing burden of roofs on it while considering other technicalities of the project as per the original design as the reasons behind extending its deadline.According to the smart city CEO Rishabh Gupta, the cost of the project has not increased despite extending the project’s deadline. Restoration of Rajawada palace is very technical work that will give enough strength to the historical building to withstand for next 100 years. The project is likely to be completed by June this year. TNN||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/indore/rajwada-restoration-to-take-5-more-months/articleshow/89066813.cms||---

The shops were illegally constructed and thus, the shopkeepers were issued notice to vacate the spot but to no avail.During Monday morning’s drive, the IMC removal gang faced resentment from the shopkeepers as they alleged that the action was politically motivated and was being carried out on behest of some influential people to cause them financial damage.Cops present on the spot however managed to persuade the shopkeepers and controlled the situation from escalating further.With the help of three earthmovers, IMC removed all the shops that were allegedly placed illegally. The drive paved way for widening of the left turn while a place of worship, situated behind the illegal shops, now also got its entries cleared for the devotees.According to the senior IMC officials, the left turn will be constructed on the available space in days to come that will help in easing frequent traffic jams and will facilitate the commuters traveling on this busy road.

The district, which was registering single digit cases till the first week of January, is recording a sudden spike in cases.As of Friday, the district has 1,593 active cases with 1,313 patients placed under home isolation. Rural areas are registering more cases when compared to urban areas, according to officials.The district administration has issued an order to convert the archery school into a 60-bed CCC to provide treatment to patients from adjoining villages of Santhemarahalli.As many as 40 tribal students from Soliga, Betta Kuruba, Jenu Kuruba, Beda and other communities selected from Bidar, Hubballi- Dharwad, Chikkamagalur, Ballari, Mysuru, Shivamogga are undergoing training at the institution. The trainees attend schools and colleges during the day. Of them, 11 are studying in high school, 16 are in PU and 13 are pursuing different courses at Kuderu Government First Grade College. The school, established in 2016 on five-acre land by the department of youth empowerment and sports (DYES), is a first-of-its-kind facility in the state that identifies and grooms tribal students across the state.The order issued by district administration has affected the training and, the students have started to vacate the residential school. Last year too, the district administration had converted the school into a CCC from April to September. As all the schools were shut down due to Covid last year, it did not particularly impact the studies and training at the institution, but now, with the district administration new order to convert the residential school into CCC, the students are worried about the learning gap getting worse. Speaking to TOI, assistant director of youth empowerment and sports affairs Anitha said that district administration has permitted the students to continue their education at school and colleges in their hometown. “Apart from this, students can also undergo archery and fencing sports training in other institutions of the state for the time being.

---||Nagpur||‘Startup culture booming in city, but needs investor base’||Stories of startups getting billion-dollar valuation have fuelled dreams of scores of entrepreneurs to pitch the ‘next big idea’. While in India the startup hub is mostly centred in metros like Bengaluru, Mumbai etc., tier-2 cities are slowly emerging as incubation centres for some unique business ideas. In an interview to TOI, Deepak Menaria, founder of Lemon School of Entrepreneurship, says startups are growing in Nagpur at a rapid pace but the base of investors to support the initial funding needs to expand. Excerpts... Q. How fast is the startup culture growing in Nagpur? A. About seven or eight years ago, there were probably 40-odd startups in Nagpur region or let’s say Vidarbha. Now we have around 450-500. So, the startup story is growing at a rapid pace in our Nagpur region. I have seen this journey very closely in the last eight years wherein more of the innovations are coming from smaller towns. They are doing good because they have undergone those problems and are best for finding solutions related to it. In 2013, we had our first startup contest and only six entries came from Vidarbha, while now almost 70 entries come from here. This growth of 10 times tells us that we are living in some very exciting times. Q. Are these ideas coming mostly from youths? A. While there’s no age group for entrepreneurship, people as young as 17 to those in their sixties are coming up with ideas. That’s probably the best thing about entrepreneurship because it has no age barrier, no academic barrier. But to answer your question, yes, we are seeing that majority of the people coming to us with ideas are in the 22-28 age group. Q. What is the biggest challenge for people with bright ideas, pitching it properly to investors or getting the actual funds? A. There is a lot of media hype about unicorn (a startup which reached a billion-dollar valuation) stories and it’s good too. But the problem it creates is that every youth now wants a million dollars in funding. I tell everyone that getting funding is just one of the milestones, but not the only one for you. The main goal for you should be to have a plan for becoming sustainable, profitable and making an impact on the world. There are lot of things that need to happen between getting an idea and seeking funds from investors. You need to test the idea, spend time in solving the problem and validate the idea. The approach to validation is very important because it involves spending time with potential customers who will agree that yes, we need a solution to a particular problem. If you are able to do this, then getting funding won’t be a problem. Q. It seems that getting funding is not the problem. A. Absolutely. There are enough investors in the world who are looking to put their money into the right kind of business. The problem is more of finding good ideas to put their money in. Q. Are business ideas now focused only on technology products/services? A. Most of them yes, but we do get a lot of people who want to expand and innovate with traditional businesses too. I always tell people that they should always leave one seat on the board for Mr. Technology. It will help you scale up and make a wider impact. Q. While the startup culture is growing in Nagpur, what’s the investor scenario like? A. This is one area where we can improve more. What we need is a local base of investors who have the vision and risk appetite for early rounds of funding. The risk is inversely proportionate to the stage of business. In the early phase, investment in business is very risky but potential returns are very high. And if you invest at a later stage then the risk is low, but so would be the returns. I believe that having a group of angel investors from the local community is crucial because it creates the right kind of an ecosystem in which startups can flourish. Q. What advice would you give to those looking to pitch their ideas? A. The most important one is not to rush into it. There is an appropriate time for pitching and that happens after you have done a lot of research, both on the ground and off it. Investors are looking not just for an idea, but a proper plan on how that idea will be turned into a successful business. Entrepreneurs must remember that if someone is investing money, s/he is not doing it for charity but for returns. So the investor is thinking in terms of an exit strategy and returns. All these things need to be clearly identified by those pitching ideas.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/startup-culture-booming-in-city-but-needs-investor-base/articleshow/89065729.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

On the ground, this has "unnerved" local minority leaders considerably and may hurt the alliance candidates' prospects in some seats, say analysts. The pattern rivals that of the BJP, which has also fielded only Hindu candidates in the region. Congress, on the other hand, has fielded two Muslims and BSP three. Leaders of the SP-RLD combine fear that fielding candidates from the minority community could lead to a division of votes, directly benefiting BJP. But, it could also be counterproductive and lead to a drift of Muslim voters. As per official estimates, Muzaffarnagar has a population of about 25 lakh with roughly 42% Muslims. BJP emerged victorious in all seats back in 2017 after fielding only Hindu candidates. BSP had fielded three Muslims then and SP one. In this election, both Congress and BSP have fielded Muslim candidates from Charthawal and Meerapur seats. In Budhana, too, BSP has given a ticket to a minority candidate. Other parties like Chandrashekhar's Azad Samaj Party and Hyderabad-based AIMIM have fielded Muslim candidates as well. Mursaleen Rana, ex-BSP MLA, who had joined RLD recently and wanted to contest from Charthawal, said, "The RLD wanted to give tickets to Muslims in Muzaffarnagar, but SP was not keen. The alliance by not giving ticket to any Muslim candidate may suffer defeat in at least three segments in Muzaffarnagar. BSP candidates may get more Muslim votes." SP member Haji Liyakat, who had fought the 2017 polls from Meerapur and lost by only 193 votes, said, "There is some heartburn here. Muslims should have been given tickets. But, at the end of the day, we accept the party high command's decision." Local politician and former councillor Faisal Saifi said, "The decision not to give a ticket to any Muslim has forced the community to think hard about their own Muslim leadership. Minority candidates fielded by BSP, Congress and AIMIM will be the first choice. This may make things easier for the BJP." Echoing similar sentiments, Naushad Ahmed, a local shopkeeper, said, "In 2017, SP had given one and RLD two tickets to Muslim candidates, but this time both Akhilesh Yadav and Jayant Chaudhary were probably a bit Muslim-shy and preferred other options."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/muslim-shy-sp-rld-unnerves-community-in-muzaffarnagar/articleshow/89064821.cms||Mohd Dilshad

Kota Srinivasa Poojary, the minister of the social welfare department and backward classes welfare, has said that all district administrations are advised to open such care centres in residential schools only as the last option. “We have advised the district administrations to explore all other options before closing the residential schools to open CCCs. If there are no alternatives, our schools will be used because Covid-19 is a big crisis and at present the state is witnessing a huge number of cases,” he said. However, in the taluks, residential schools run by the government agencies such as the Ekalavya Schools, Kittur Rani Chennamma Schools, Morarji Desai Residential School are now being converted into Covid care centres. This decision has not found acceptance among parents who want the district administrations to find alternatives. Many of the government-run residential schools have children from the disadvantaged sections of society who cannot afford online learning. This is another reason why the parents are concerned. Last week, the parents of students the Morarji Desai Residential School from Nanjangud protested the school’s conversion into a Covid centre. The parents said that the SSLC and II PUC examinations are round the corner and in such a scenario if the residential schools are used as CCCs, it will create a problem for their children. Similar protests are now reported from Madikeri and other parts of the state too. “In all the taluks, the residential schools of backward classes, SC, ST students are being converted as CCCs. It is causing a problem for the kids. Rural students are not familiar with online classes. The government should not convert any residential schools into CCCs,” said activist KS Shivaramu.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/parents-protest-as-residential-schools-turn-covid-care-centres/articleshow/89066822.cms||---

The health department had issued an advisory against such over-the-counter sales. It was aimed at ensuring that all fever-related cases are reported to the medical practitioners. However, the over-the-counter sale problem has surfaced again in the district. The fever medicines are now available without prescription easily. Officials from the state health department have informed that they will look into the issue. According to the healthcare professionals, fever cases are on a rise in the city for the last few days, but a majority are turning to pharmacies seeking medicines instead of consulting doctors or undergoing RT-PCR tests. As a result, many Covid cases go unnoticed. According to the several pharmacy executives, people visit the shop seeking tables like paracetamol and dolo 650 among others without any prescription. “They seek these tablets like any chocolate. Many seek paediatric fever medicine also without any prescription which is a real cause of concern,” they explained. Mysuru Pharma Forum president Sudheendra A urged the people to consult doctors before taking any medicine. “Many come with old prescriptions seeking tablets. It is better to opt for RT-PCR test before taking any medicines. If the results come positive, there is a government notified treatment protocol. If the test result is negative, doctors prescribe required medicines. We appeal to public is please consult doctors instead of taking any medicines directly,” he said. State health commissioner Randeep D informed that the department will take action to curb the practice.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/unmonitored-otc-drug-sales-for-fever-a-cause-for-concern/articleshow/89066824.cms||Shrinivasa M

Sushma Suresh, a resident of VC Hosur in Chamarajanagar, and Shreyas Mahadevappanavaru, a resident of Channappanapura in Chamarajanagar, are getting married on Sunday. “Their marriage was fixed four months ago,” said Suresh, the father of the bride Sushma. At that time, there were no signs of a third wave. Initially, both the families had decided to hold the wedding in Chamarajanagar city, in the presence of hundreds of guests, including relatives. Invitations were printed and distributed. However, now the families printed another invitation, seeking the blessings of their relatives and friends, but requesting them not to attend the wedding physically. As per the revised guidelines, even though there is permission to invite guests for weddings in limited numbers, both the families decided to hold it in a simple way, without inviting guests.

Although no help was forthcoming from the authorities, Ishaq decided to build a temporary structure to keep his library going, to continue his mission to cultivate among the citizens of Mysuru the habit of reading.‘Public Library’, as Ishaq calls it, is in Rajivnagar, and the elderly man has decided to have schoolchildren inaugurate the new avatar of his library on January 26. “So far, there have been no signs of the library being rebuilt, and I have given up hope. So, using funds that many members of the public so generously donated, I have built a structure with metal sheets at the same place where the original building stood. I have fenced the area with whatever resources I could get my hands on,” Ishaq said.The plot, CA site, in question was entrusted to Ishaq by the Mysore Urban Development Authority. He has utilised 5,000sqft of the plot for the library. In April 2021, a devastating fire destroyed the library, consuming hundreds of books, most of which were in Kannada. “The authorities promised to rebuild the structure, but no steps have been taken, and I decided I could wait no longer,” Ishaq added.Citizens have donated nearly a thousand books, mostly Kannada titles, for Ishaq’s new library. He added that a dozen Kannada and English newspapers would also be available at his library. “Nearly 170 readers are turning up at my library regularly and borrowing books,” a proud Ishaq said.Ishaq believes that a library is the spiritual equivalent of a 100 places of worship, and added that he had plans to build another structure adjacent to the existing one. “The new block will be exclusively for women,” said Ishaq, who is being assisted by his son Aftab, an autodriver, in his endeavour.Former gram panchayat member for M Shettihalli Mahalingappa is among Ishaq’s regular customers. He has been visiting the library for eight years. “Inspired by him, I tried to start a library in my village, but to no avail. I will make sure I visit Ishaq’s library each time I am in Mysuru city,” Mahalingappa said.Deputy director of public libraries, Mysuru B Manjunatha said, “Following the fire that destroyed the library, it was decided that a permanent structure would be built on the same site. In the meantime, Ishaq has constructed a temporary structure. We have informed him that the temporary structure will be removed once the government sanctions funds for a new building, and the books donated by citizens will be kept in the library.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/syed-ishaq-builds-a-temporary-structure-for-his-library/articleshow/89066829.cms||Lawrence Milton

The census in the other tiger reserves — Nagarahole, Bhadra, BRT and Kali— will begin on Sunday. Census in Malemahadeshwara Hills Wildlife sanctuary is set to begin from February. The state has five tiger reserves and 23 wildlife sanctuaries. The census assumes significance for Karnataka as it is looking to regain the No.1 spot among the tiger states in the country. In the 2018 census, Madhya Pradesh won the coveted ‘tiger state’ tag with 526 tigers while Karnataka recorded two less, 524. Unlike the previous census which began simultaneously in all reserves and wildlife sanctuaries, this time, it has been divided and left to each division to decide their date of commencement. The census is expected to be completed by February 8. Apart from tigers, data on other animals like elephants, Indian gaurs, deer will also be collected and compiled. Amid the absence of volunteers, forest department officials are taking up this exercise in two phases.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/ktaka-keeps-fingers-crossed-as-tiger-census-begins/articleshow/89066830.cms||---

The farmers have a seven-point charter of demands. New Capital Project-affected Farmers’ Welfare Committee president Roopan Chandrakar told TOI that the farmers are peeved at the manner in which urban administration minister Dr Shiv Deharia, the local legislator, treated the local Sarpanchs, who were invited for talks with him, by asking them about their purpose of visit. “Now, we have come to a point that no delegation would go for any meeting with ministers or officials without a written communication”. Though the minister later sent a written invitation, the farmers did not show up as it was sent just five minutes before the scheduled meeting. The farmers' demands include implementation of provision for free allotment of land under Naya Raipur rehabilitation package, payment of compensation four times more than the market rate to all those who have not received compensation under the provisions of land acquisition act, grant of patta for rural settlements in Naya Raipur area, fulfilling the promise of allotting 75 %of shops, commercial blocks and small stalls to project-affected people at actual cost and lifting the ban on purchase and sale of property in the capital project area.

The accused fled as soon as her parents filed a complaint, but he was tracked down and arrested on Friday.The grandfather was visiting relatives in a village around a half-hour’s drive from Baloda Bazar town in June last year when he saw his nephew’s teenage daughter and began following her around the house, says her complaint.One day, on finding her alone at home, he forced himself on her.

---||Raipur||Take liberal approach to reimbursement of medical treatment: HC||Raipur: The Chhattisgarh high court has held that the provisions related to reimbursement of medical treatment have to be construed liberally as the right to health is a fundamental right and self-preservation of life is included in the right to life. The bench of justice Sanjay K Agrawal passed this order while hearing a petition filed by Dr Ambedkar hospital’s retired staff nurse Khuku Biswas, She took an exception to a decision taken by the hospital superintendent to return her medical bills on the ground that post-facto sanction has not been granted by the competent authority. The petitioner, while in service as a staff nurse underwent surgery of her spinal cord at a private hospital in Raipur in the last week of June and she was discharged in July 2019. Thereafter, she claimed reimbursement of medical bill amounting to Rs 99743, but the authorities returned the bill on the ground that she has not intimated the fact of surgery in accordance with the Chhattisgarh civil services (medical attendance) rules. Praying for reimbursement of bills, petitioner’s counsel Akash Kumar Kundu submitted that it was an urgent surgery. The patient had remained in hospital for seven days and thereafter she submitted the bill. He contended that the return of medical bills is totally arbitrary as self-preservation of one’s life is the necessary concomitant of the right to life enshrined in Article 21 of the Constitution of India. He also prayed for setting aside the order by which the medical bills were returned. However, deputy advocate Jitendra Pali, appearing for the state, argued that the petitioner or her family members must have approcahed the director, medical education / director, AYUSH and to the Head of the Department within the time limit of 48 hours from the commencement of treatment, which has not been done and therefore the rules cannot be invoked. Quoting principles laid down by the Supreme court, Justice Sanjay K Agrawal said in his order that the provisions relating to reimbursement of medical treatment have to be construed liberally. The petitioner had the right to take steps in self-preservation of her own life, which is a facet of the right to health and thus, she immediately got herself admitted to the hospital for medical treatment (canal stenosis), but on account of urgent medical need, she or her family members could not intimate as envisaged in the rules. The high court directed the competent authority to consider the case of the petitioner for grant of post-facto sanction under Chhattisgarh civil services (Medical attendance) Rules-2013 within 45 days days from the date of receipt of a copy of this order on its own merit, in accordance with the law.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/take-liberal-approach-to-reimbursement-of-medical-treatment-hc/articleshow/89066841.cms||---

Some patients who recently followed such unverified treatments ended up with severe health complications and had to rush to a hospital. Health wing officials are at this time providing free phone consultation with doctors through the 104 helpline while the sub-collector’s office is continuously tracking the health status of patients. However, many are turning to medical prescriptions circulated on messaging platforms. “We are noticing fewer complications in the third wave. Majority of patients are recovering with multivitamin tablets and paracetamol. But patients are taking high doses of antibiotics and tablets such Ivermectin following old prescriptions sent via messaging apps. This is worsening their health and causing weakness and body pains,” said city-based physician Dr V Bhagyaraju. Dr Bhagyaraju said health wing and drug control officials should stop selling high doses of antibiotics over the counter without a prescription. Meanwhile, doctors and the health wing expressed concern over unscientific medical practices for Covid-19 treatment. In one such instance, several people who followed a social media post, inhaled black pepper powder into their noses and had to visit a hospital for treatment. “There are some treatments in alternative medicine for fever and other Covid-19 symptoms. But these should be used under the supervision of doctors. Home remedies can sometimes become dangerous. Many patients suffered burns after carrying out vapour therapy for a long time during the second wave. Now, patients are smelling pungent substances and coming to hospitals. We request people not to trust such treatments and get phone consultations with qualified doctors,” said Dr K Bhargav, a pulmonologist in the city.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/covid-cures-floating-on-social-media-send-patients-to-hospital/articleshow/89066848.cms||Venu Lanka

An official of the rank of joint collector, along with district health and medical officers, is continuously monitoring the rates for Covid-19 treatment at corporate hospitals and nursing homes. While hospitalisation rates may be low than the second wave, some hospitals in Vijayawada, Guntur, Rajahmundry, Eluru and Visakhapatnam are charging high fees and bed charges for Covid-19 treatment. Joint collector (welfare) L Siva Shankar has directed the health wing to conduct a row of inspections in corporate hospitals in Vijayawada after he received complaints on the fee structure. District medical and health officer (DM&HO) Dr Suhasini and deputy DM&HOs have begun inspections at hospitals to ensure display boards of rates fixed by the government for various services are in place. The health wing is also focusing on allocation of beds to patients with YSR Aarogyasri cards. A special 24x7 cell has been arranged to receive complaints from patients. Meanwhile, drug authorities are monitoring the supply of Remdesivir injections and their black marketing. “Remdesivir vials are being directly supplied to hospitals and there is no shortage. Patients can complain to us if any hospital demands fees higher than the prescribed rates,” said Siva Shankar. Meanwhile, serpentine queues could be seen outside private Covid-19 testing laboratories at Tikkle Road, Nakkala Road and Suryaraopet.

It is an insult to martyrdom to put out the Amar Jawan Jyoti, which has been paying homage to the martyrs for 50 years.” He added that “Doing such misdeeds is an attempt to change history, but the Modi government should understand that such efforts do not change history, but a golden history has to be made by doing great deeds.” “Amar Jawan Jyoti was the memory of the soldiers who broke Pakistan in two. Closing it and giving it the name of ‘merger’ is an attempt to dilute the purity of that light. It is highly condemnable to do such an act on completion of 50 years of Bangladesh war victory,” he added. The PM had announced that a grand statue of freedom fighter Subash Chndra Bose will be installed at India Gate as a symbol of India’s ‘indebtedness’ to him, soon after Opposition parties criticised the government for the decision to put out the flame at Amar Jawan Jyoti and merge it with the immortal flame at the National War Memorial the other day.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/shifting-of-amar-jawan-jyoti-an-insult/articleshow/89066861.cms||---

He said the proposed change was going to affect the spirit of cooperative federalism. This will violate the constitutional jurisdiction prescribed for the central and state governments and reduce the spirit of working fearlessly and faithfully, he said. Quoting India's first home minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Gehlot said, “If you want an efficient all-India service, I advise you that you give the services an opportunity to express themselves freely.

After Govind Guru Tribal University, Banswara, MLS University in Udaipur has slapped 18% GST on its affiliated colleges.

The situation has reached a level where university authorities and the colleges had a heated argument in a meeting on January 17. The police had to be called to disperse the college owners. The colleges contended that due to pandemic they have suffered heavy losses as several students have sought fee waiver due to the loss of livelihood of their parents. “We have accommodated several students without fees in the past two years.

December 2021 export was $3,040.92 million (Rs 22,914.63 crore) against $2,348.44 million (Rs 16,712.46) achieved two years ago. The export of gold jewellery has recorded a minor, but noteworthy growth — in a sector that was not recovering for long since the first wave of Covid-induced pandemic began. Against $775.36 million in 2019, exports in December 2021 touched $778.04 million, which had earlier dropped to $502.59 million.

The growth is 25.41% less in comparison to 2019. “India’s performance in the crucial Christmas quarter capped a spectacular year for the gem and jewellery industry. The holiday bounce has managed to offset part of the post-Diwali export slump when factories normally take a short break,” said Colin Shah, chairman, GJEPC. “Holiday and festive demand were robust in important trading centres including the US, Hong Kong, Thailand, and Israel. And we have every reason to believe that this momentum will carry through the end of FY 2022, bringing us closer to the set target of $41.67 billion in exports,” Shah added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gems-jewellery-exports-top-pre-covid-levels/articleshow/89066882.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

Further, they should arrange vaccination for those who have not received the doses,” the DC directed BLOs and other officials at a virtual meeting on Friday. He directed 1,861 BLOs and 186 supervisors in Dakshina Kannada to visit the houses in their respective areas. “Officials should carry out the electoral roll verification and the identification of vaccination status of eligible beneficiaries simultaneously. They should find citizens above 18, who are not enrolled in the voters list, and take initiatives to provide them the voting rights by obtaining a Form 6. In the meantime, officials should collect information regarding all eligible beneficiaries who are above 15 in each house, for the vaccination drive. Inform the nearest health centre or gram panchayat and make arrangements to administer vaccines to them, if they have not taken it yet. Collect information on bed-ridden patients in houses, and make arrangements to administer vaccines to them,” the DC said. The district will hold vaccine melas on Tuesdays and Fridays, through taluk level officials. In addition, micro plans will have to be prepared to reach all eligible beneficiaries in villages, the DC said. He warned disciplinary action against medical officers, who fail to achieve targets at the PHC and sub-centre levels. Teachers to get precautionary dose of vaccineHe directed the rural development and panchayat raj and revenue departments to verify the vaccine certificates of all the officials and staff in the district. The district will also provide precautionary doses of the vaccine to teachers, along with other beneficiaries, who have completed nine months after receiving the second dose, he added.

This is probably the first-of-its-kind initiative introduced by the department, where these electric vehicles will be provided to the vendors, said minister for fisheries, ports and inland water transport S Angara.He told STOI that under the ‘Fresh fish to home’ programme of the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana, electric vehicles will be distributed to the beneficiaries in the next 15 days. The department has reserved Rs 4 crore for the project. The cost of each vehicle is about Rs 8 lakh, and is fitted with solar panels and cold storage facility. This is an attempt to generate self-employment, and provide the consumer quality fish. In the first phase, plans are to distribute these unique e-vehicles in all the taluks of Dakshina Kannada district. “We plan to procure more vehicles in the next financial year. The formal launch will be announced after consulting chief minister Basavaraj Bommai,” Angara said.The vehicles will be fitted with a solar panel, freezer, swappable lithium batteries, speaker and GPRS, and is connected to an fisheries department app to take orders. Beneficiaries for the purchase of the vehicle will be selected by the fisheries department, and priority will be given to women. Currently, there are several programmes launched for the fishing community, including Matsya Ashraya Yojane, Matsya Mahila Swalambana Yojane, and Matsya Vahini Scheme, among others. If we include the ‘Fresh Fish to Home’ concept for the fishermen who sell fish on the streets in the coastal areas, they can earn more profits. The sales volume will increase at least 10 times. Generally, women selling fish are found only in coastal areas. If we promote and encourage more beneficiaries, and strengthen the transportation system, so that fresh fish reaches the destination quickly, then the number of entrepreneurs selling fish can increase by 40% in the state,” said an official working closely on the project. Team officials including Ramacharya, director, fisheries, Mallikharjun, special officer on duty for the fisheries minister and Arun Dhanapal are closely working on the project.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/fish-vendors-will-soon-get-solar-powered-e-vehicles/articleshow/89066887.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

The patient was diagnosed with jaw opening dystonia, where he was facing difficulty in closing the jaw, speaking, and chewing food. Initially, medication was given to improve the dystonia. Later, a CT-guided botox injection was administered by Dr Keerthiraj, interventional neuroradiologist and Dr Rohit Pai, neurologist.Dr Rohit Pai said, “The patient was initially given medicines to improve the dystonia. That resulted in minimal improvement. Hence, he was then given a botox injection. Generally, botox can be given into the lateral pterygoid muscles by extraoral (from outside the mouth) or intraoral approach (inside the mouth). The most commonly used approach is extraoral.”Dr Rohit Pai added, “CT-guided injection box technique was used, where the muscle was identified by CT.

To reach out to those beneficiaries, who have been showing hesitancy, the MCC has planned a mega vaccination drive. In addition to the mega drive, the MCC also has kept mobile vaccine vans ready, so that people can get doses at their doorstep, by just calling the city corporation.DHO Dr M Kishore Kumar told TOI that as per the data available with the health department, a majority of those who are not covered under the vaccination drive are in the urban areas of Mangaluru. “The district has already achieved 96.5% of the target in the first dose of vaccination for the eligible population who are above 18. Meanwhile, 81.5% of them have received the second too. Only 3.5% of the eligible population in the category are yet to be covered in the entire district. In the 15-18 years category, the district has achieved 108% of the target, by administering the first dose to 1.1 lakh beneficiaries in the district,” Dr Kumar said.The district has planned mega drives, especially in the Mangaluru city limits, to vaccinate all the target beneficiaries, he added.MCC commissioner Akshy Sridhar said the government has taken serious cognizance of the unvaccinated population in the MCC limits. “It has been noted that 50% of the unvaccinated population in the district reside in the MCC limits. To weaken the impact of the third wave and protect our elderly, medical staff and Covid warriors, they must be vaccinated. It has also been mandated that all Covid warriors must receive the booster dose. We conducted a mega vaccination drive on Saturday. Vaccines and booster doses can be availed across 39 vaccination centres, including 10 urban PHCs, malls, public spaces, and markets. Those who want mobile vaccination facilities, may contact their respective ward’s Covid nodal officers, UPHC nodal officers, medical officers or the city corporation’s nodal officer,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/50-of-unvaccinated-are-in-city-limits/articleshow/89066889.cms||Vinobha K T

He called upon people to empower themselves through education. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also visited Shivagiri Mutt in Kerala, and sought the blessings of Sri Narayana Guru in 2015. People from various sections of society, from the Prime Minister of India to an ordinary layman, respects Sri Narayana Guru,” the minister told the media after offering prayers at the temple, and added that he will also meet the Kudroli temple’s chief patron B Janardhana Poojari. The minister blamed the Communist government in Kerala for levelling allegations against the central government and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in connection with rejecting the tableau. “Since the central government has not given proper information to Kerala, they proposed a float on Sri Narayana Guru. Neither the Prime Minister nor the central government and BJP are linked to the rejection of the tableau. It is common that some floats are rejected, and a few are selected every year. Unfortunately, the Kerala government has politicised the issue and started blaming the Prime Minister. Meanwhile, the Congress too has taken up the issue to blame the BJP and the Prime Minister,” Poojari said. BJP state president Nalin Kumar Kateel, energy minister V Sunil Kumar and I have already clarified that the state government, central government and the BJP have utmost respect for Sri Narayana Guru. We have requested all political leaders not to continue the blame game for political mileage. The central government, state government and the BJP will be part of all programmes dedicated to Sri Narayana Guru, he said. The minister said that the then chief minister Siddaramaiah had refused to visit the Kudroli Temple in 2016, where the Shivaling was consecrated by Sri Narayana Guru in 1912. Former Union minister B Janardhana Poojari had called upon people to offer special prayers and hold rallies to mark their protest against the tableau rejection issue on January 26.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/min-kota-offers-prayers-to-sri-narayana-guru/articleshow/89066891.cms||---

Following this, one such facility has come up in Lasalgaon.This comes after cases started rising significantly and people started resisting institutional quarantine facilities. Dr Sujit Koshire, the taluka health officer of Niphad said there was an urgent need to ensure people were quarantined so the infection did not spread to their family members or even the neighbours. “During the peak of the second wave when the active cases were on the rise, the gram panchayats had opened up quarantine facilities under the watchful eyes of the health authorities,” said Dr Koshire. Patients, especially those who were asymptomatic did not want to go to Covid care centres that were away from their villages. With centres coming up near the village, the GPs has to arrange for the infrastructure and security as the food was being provided by the family members and the health was taken care of by the health department.

During the meeting, Pawar thanked Vaishnaw for starting of the Mainline Multiple Electrical Unit (Memu) instead of regular rake for ‘passenger train service’ to various destinations in north Maharashtra as it is elegant, comfortable and faster than the earlier rakes of the train.Pawar, meanwhile, raised two issues with the railway minister — increasing the number of parcel vans and reinstating of halts at various railway stations that were discontinued since restarting of trains that were closed during the national lockdown.The Kisan Rail project has been a boon for the farmers who can ship their consignments from various stations to the destinations on regular basis with 50% discount and timely delivery of goods. “Lasalgaon is a renowned market committee in Asia for sale and purchase of onion, husk, oilseeds, pomegranate, vegetables, among others. Therefore, more parcel vans should be allowed in the rake,” Pawar said. Until recently two parcel vans were allotted for the Lasalgaon station and that has now been curtailed to one. The grape season has begun, and the single van is insufficient even to accommodate the current bookings of onion, pomegranate and vegetables that farmers grow here.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/bharati-pawar-for-more-parcel-vans-from-lasalgaon-station/articleshow/89066900.cms||---

It becomes easier for schools to coordinate with the health department in the process.“With reopening of schools, we look forward to faster vaccination drive as on-site sessions can be done in the schools,” said Dr Ajeeta Salunke, in-charge of vaccination for Nashik Municipal Corporation and the reproductive and child health officer of the corporation.The children from standard 8 to 12, who have completed 15 years of age are eligible for vaccination drive that started on January 4. “We had started coordinating with the schools for on-site vaccination sessions. We had around 12 to 15 schools carrying out vaccination on daily basis. But when the schools were closed again, the number of sessions dropped to about five,” said Dr Salunke. The Nashik Municipal Corporation has organised vaccination sessions for children at six different locations apart from those at schools. Similar is the case in Nashik rural areas where the vaccination sessions are being conducted at respective primary health centres as well as the schools who offer their premises for the sessions. “In rural areas, the schools have been linked to the primary health centre in whose jurisdiction they fall. Besides, the sessions are also conducted in the schools,” senior officer in the rural health department said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/health-dept-to-speed-up-childrens-vax-in-schools/articleshow/89066901.cms||---

---||Allahabad||Prayagraj: Kalpwasis, campers breathe easy as water level of Ganga stabilises||PRAYAGRAJ: After witnessing a rising trend for the past three days, the water level of river Ganga stabilised on Saturday, providing relief to a sizable number of seers, kalpwasis and devotees camping in the Magh Mela. The rise in the water level has caused bank erosion, with the water entering the camps of Sectors 2 and 3. While people were shifted to safer places, authorities have put up sand bags to check further erosion of the banks by the strong currents of Ganga. The volume of water, which in previous years was quite shallow and infact the Allahabad High Court had to intervene, asking the authorities to release extra water in Ganga, is flowing 107cm more than last year (as on Friday), due to which the water has entered a large area of its bank. Although the level of water has came down a bit, it could again set the alarm bells ringing, following the release of water from Ganga barrage in Kanpur. The mela administration is constantly monitoring the situation and providing all help to the affected devotees. Divisional commissioner Sanjay Goyal, along with officiating mela adhikari Arvind Kumar Chouhan and other officials, took stock of the situation and instructed the authorities to provide a solution to the problems arising out of the rise in the water level of river Ganga. The irrigation department has been told to check the water entering the mela area at Gangdweep, Sector 3, Sector 2 and other affected places. The divisional commissioner has also asked to increase the number of manpower, tractors and pumps to remove the water from the mela area. During the inspection, Goyal also expressed his displeasure over the slow action being taken by the officials of the Jal Nigam. The divisional commissioner has directed all the officers concerned to pour more sand in the affected areas and to drain out the water continuously by installing more pumps. “Due to the rise in water level, the process of shifting all the affected 44 institutions and Prayagwals of Gangadweep to Sector 5 and to provide all the basic facilities has already started. But as many devotees do not want to shift to Sector 5, we are taking a written consent from those who do not want to move even after providing all the basic facilities,” said the Mela adhikari. Commenting on the water level in the river, head of the department of Geography, Prof AR Siddiqui said, “It is because of the heavy rainfall in the Himalayan region and since farmer do not use much water in their fields owning to rains and low usage of water for irrigation during Rabi crop, the volume of water in Ganga is fairly more.” Likewise, executive engineer at flood control department, Brijesh Kumar Verma said, “We are keeping a constant watch on the level of water in both the rivers and fortunately, the water level is stable”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/kalpwasis-campers-breathe-easy-as-water-level-of-ganga-stabilises/articleshow/89066904.cms||Rajeev Mani

(What is there in UP?” in response to BJP MP Ravi Kishan’s number “UP Mein Sab Ba” (UP has everything). In an apparent attack, Maurya — BJP candidate from the Sirathu assembly seat in Kaushambi — tweeted: “UP mein ie baa…Kisan ko cheh hajar ba, rashan do-do bar ba, mahilaon ko adhikaar ba, sab gundan ko bukhar ba, dangai ki sampatti per bulldozer se prahar ba.” Though his tweet, the deputy CM listed out the welfare measures of the government, saying farmers in UP get an income support of Rs 6,000 per annum under the PM Kisan Yojana, double ration is distributed to Antyodaya cardholders and eligible families, rights of women are protected, criminals are on backfoot and rioters are being taken to task by razing their assets. Few days back, Rathore had uploaded a song stating the poor state of affairs in the state on different issues. She had named her song as ‘UP Mein Ka Ba’ after Ravi Kishan’s song was launched by chief minister Yogi Adityanath in Gorakhpur on January 15. Rathore, who also brought out campaign songs during the Bihar assembly elections, appeared to question Yogi for his achievements, handling of the Hathras incident and Covid-19. The song also raised the issue of mowing down of farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri on October 3, 2021.

For example, earlier, BJP had 1,252 booth committees in the Sangam City area, whose numbers have now been increased to 1,293 by the party, informed BJP city unit president Ganesh Kesarwani. With this, a committee of 21 people has also been constituted at each booth to motivate BJP voters to cast their votes and also ensure that they face no problems in exercising their right to franchise, he added.Apart from the president, general secretary, other office bearers of all party frontal organizations have been included in these committees. Women have also been given proper representation so that door-to-door campaigning can reach even the women of every household. In this, workers of every caste and class have been given representation, Kesarwani added.BJP leader and former convener of BJP legal cell of Kashi Kshetra that covers 16 districts including Allahabad’s city, trans-Ganga and trans-Yamuna areas Devendra Nath Mishra said that BJP keeps on changing the structure of its organization from time to time as per need. “Just before the 2017 assembly elections, the number of presidents in the district was increased from two to three. Earlier there were city unit president and district president. In 2017, the system of city unit, trans-Ganga and trans-Yamuna district presidents was implemented. Not only this, earlier there were 10 “mandals” in the city itself but whose numbers were then increased to 15 two years ago,” he said.Mishra said that this time every “Panna Pramukh” has been entrusted task to focus their attentions on 60 voters each taking in to account that a voter list’s page has 30 names on one side and another 30 on its reverse side.“The booth level committee members including the Panna Pramukhs have already started visiting the homes of voters concerned apprising them of the party’s achievements and motivating them to come out and vote on the polling day,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/bjp-enhances-number-of-booth-committees/articleshow/89066907.cms||---

Consequently, most Covid patients in the district are quarantined at home. Although this has reduced the load on all designated Covid hospitals in the district, the health department is grappling with the logistical problem of ensuring adequate medical care for those quarantined at home.Now, the district administration has launched, in collaboration with local bodies including the Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation (HDMC), a round-the-clock service wherein medicines will be supplied to Covid patients at their doorstep.Dharwad deputy commissioner Nitesh Patil pointed out that, though the number of cases being reported daily had jumped to three digits, the percentage of those being hospitalised was less. “Nearly 95% of those infected with Covid are quarantined at homes. There is the chance that patients quarantined at home cannot step out to purchase medicines. To ensure they have all they need at home, we have decided to deliver medicines to their homes across the district,” Patil told TOI.He added that HDMC, in addition to setting up a helpline that patients can call seeking help, had deployed staff to deliver medicines to patients’ homes. Patil said, “The helpline is to ensure that there is no delay in delivering the medicines. HDMC zonal officers will arrange for delivery of medicines in wards under their jurisdiction, while in the rural areas, medicines will be available at primary health centres and taluk health centres.”Affirming that all PHCs and taluk hospitals had been supplied with sufficient medicines, the DC said that they had hired 30 vehicles for delivering medicines to homes.HDMC commissioner Gopal Krishna said that people could call the following numbers for medicines, enquire about beds, et al: 0836-2213803; 0836-2213806; 91410151611.Nitesh Patil said that 20 medical students from SDM Medical College, and 25 at the Karnataka Institute of Medical Sciences would be enlisted to help the district administration monitor those quarantined at home, starting Monday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/covid-19-patients-to-get-medicines-delivered-at-home/articleshow/89066912.cms||---

The solo ride by Sadanand Amarapur, assistant director in the RDPR department, had twin themes: celebrate the 75th year of India’s Independence, and spread a message against addiction. All through the ride, Sadanand propagated his department’s flagship project Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA). Sadanand started off at Katra pon December 1 and rode through Panjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu before concluding the expedition at Kanyakumari. Over the 14-day, 14-hour ride through eight states, Sadanand created awareness on Azadi Ki Amrit Mahotsav, programmes/ schemes of RDPR department, and addictions. Sadanand had earned the ‘Ironman’ title by completing Herculean Triathlon (3.8km swimming, 180km cycling, and 42km running) in 15.45 hours organised by the Indian Triathlon Federation last year. Speaking on his ride, the hardcore triathlete said: “Work at our department is tight, but that did not stop me from hitting the Kashmir-Kanyakumari trail. I created awareness against addictions like drinking and smoking. I got a warm welcome everywhere.” Cherishing his journey filled with the vibrant culture of India, Sadanand said poeple should play more in playgrounds, without playing digital games on gadgets. “This will help one stay fit physically and mentally,” he added. Mohammad Roshan, CEO of Haveri Zilla Panchayat, hailed Sadanand as an active officer. “Our department is proud of his achievement. Not just in sports, he is committed to his duty too. He has set an example of leading an active life,” the CEO added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/official-cycles-3800km-spreads-message-on-government-schemes/articleshow/89066914.cms||Basavaraj Maralihalli

The state government’s decision to impose night curfew from 10pm to 5am deterred tipplers from visiting bars and restaurants because they would not be able to sit back and unwind leisurely. The fear of getting caught and fined by police for drunken driving was another reason that made tipplers stay away from bars and restaurants. Many preferred to celebrate the arrival of the New Year on December 31 at home and carried liquor by parcel. A similar situation had prevailed in December 2020 and the sale of liquor had been hit. However, when compared to the quantum of liquor sold in December 2020, there was a marginal decline in sale of hard liquor in December 2021. According to excise department officials 1,50,755 boxes of liquor of various brands were sold in December 2020 in the district while in December 2021 the quantum of liquor sold was 1,50,003 boxes. Each box contains 8.64 litres of liquor. On December 31, 2021, 6,162 boxes of Indian Made Liquor (IML) and 3,860 boxes of beer worth Rs 369.44 lakh was sold in Dharwad district while on the same date the previous year, 7,222 boxes of IML and 4,538 boxes of beer worth Rs 7738.24 lakh was sold. Excise officials and liquor sellers attribute the dip in sale of liquor for fear of catching cold and Covid. Night curfew has only added to their woes. “When the government announced total lockdown for 45 days in 2020, liquor sellers who had stock of about 300 to 400 boxes had to suffer loss to the extent of lakhs. Beer can be used for six months from the date of brewing and after that it becomes unfit for consumption. Many liquor sellers had to throw away the beer. To enable shops and clubs to exhaust the stock before the expiry date, the government had allowed the sale of beer at maximum retail price (MRP) but still there were no takers as people feared catching cold and Covid,” said Jeevan Shetty, a leading liquor trader.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/sale-of-beer-dips-in-dharwad-district/articleshow/89066915.cms||---

The rising Covid curve had prompted the state government to impose curbs on movement of people and other activities during the weekend, leaving the teetering business community further despaired. However, in the wake of several elected representatives calling on the Basavaraj Bommai-led government to lift the curbs, it was business as usual in Hubballi-Dharwad on Saturday.Although the government had exempted those engaged in the trade of essential commodities such as vegetables, milk, meat, et al, from the ambit of the curfew, many vegetable and fruit merchants said that they had sustained losses the past two weekends, owing to restrictions on movement of people from the villages to the cities. Consequently, this disrupted the supply chain, leaving the traders without fresh stock of vegetables and fruits. With the restrictions lifted, many commercial hubs in the twin cities returned to life, with customers getting busy with weekend shopping.Among others, Union minister and Dharwad MP Pralhad Joshi, Mysuru MP Pratap Simha, and other BJP leaders, had criticised the state government for imposing weekend curfew, and had urged the dispensation to reconsider its decision. Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation (HDMC) visited many shops on Saturday to ensure adhere to Covid safety norms.Anjaneya Pujar, a wholesale vegetable trader, said, “Sale of fruit and vegetables was allowed during the curfew, but villagers did not make the journey to the city owing to lack of transport facilities. Most people remained at home as well, which only hurt our business more. With the government lifting curbs, economic activities can gain momentum again.”Hotelier Santosh Shetty said that they would adhere strictly to Covid protocol, and urged the government to help them continue with their businesses. Jeevan Shetty, also involved in the hospitality sector, called on the government to impose night curfew from 11pm instead of 10pm.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/business-community-in-twin-cities-welcomes-lifting-of-weekend-curfew/articleshow/89066917.cms||---

The department of public instruction has been directed to close schools where either students or staff test positive for the novel coronavirus.Although in its order issued on January 11, the government had asked the education department to take into account the Covid situation vis-à-vis the taluk, which was to be considered a single unit to decide on continuing with on-campus classes, in the order released on Friday, the officials were asked to consider each school as a separate unit.Dharwad deputy commissioner Nitesh Patil issued an order asking all schools to resume on-campus classes from Monday. The order stated that should three to five Covid cases be reported at a school within a span of three days, the school should be closed for three days. The government’s decision to resume on-campus classes, however, has not been accepted without anxiety by parents. “On Friday, we heard that 98 children and 17 teachers had tested positive in Dharwad, and the government allows resumption of on-campus classes. The district administration is following diktats from Bengaluru.

A team of 35 volunteers, uniting under the banner of ‘Operation Madad (help)’ has been going around Belagavi distributing blankets to the homeless to help protect against the nippy air during what has been a particularly chilly winter in the border district.In the past few weeks, these volunteers visited the outskirts of Belagavi city, where many people dwell in makeshift homes, which offer little protection against the cold, and to whom blankets are, well and truly, a blessing. This team of volunteers has been reaching out to people from the vulnerable sections of society to help them combat the hardships of the Covid-induced crisis. Led by Padmaprasad Hooli, this team has been engaging with a wide variety of social issues, and trying to ease the suffering of the poor and downtrodden.Belagavi recorded the lowest temperature in Karnataka this winter, with mercury plummeting to eight degrees Celsius. It was the steep drop in temperature that inspired the team to take up the initiative of distributing blankets to the homeless.Rahul Patil, the volunteer who reportedly came up with the idea, said that they approached a few non-government organisations to seek assistance to purchase rugs for the homeless. One good deed led to another when the team decided to purchase locally made rugs, woven by members of the Kuruba community in the district.The team purchased 150 rugs from the Kuruba weavers, of which 70 were distributed to the destitute in just three days. Padmaprasad Hooli told TOI, “We are not a registered foundation but just a group of like-minded people, committed to helping people. There are lawyers, doctors, businessmen in this group. We reach out to people in times of natural calamities such as flood, and crises such as the one triggered by the pandemic. Our objective is to help vulnerable people.”Belagavi-based lecturer Vidyashree Halakerimath lauded the efforts of the team of volunteers, whom she called ‘inspiring’. “This team will keep the spirit of humanity alive. Each time I have heard about this team, I have been inspired,” she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/team-distributes-blankets-to-homeless-in-belagavi/articleshow/89066920.cms||---

However, many a good Samaritan is stepping forward to help those less fortunate combat the cold weather. One such individual is Dr Baburajendra B Naik, a diabetologist in Vijayapura, who has been going around the city distributing Solapur blankets to the homeless.Dr Naik has thus far distributed blankets to around 80 people, and has decided to continue with this mission till the weather improves in the region. “Cold wave can cause various diseases including gangrene, while it could also lead cold stroke. We found that people were sleeping on the streets, which is when we decided to start distributing blankets to the poor. We decided to order blankets from Solapur, which can be used in all seasons. Along with a few friends, we distributed blankets to 25 people. I have been carrying eight to ten blankets in my car, and distributing them to the needy, while returning home from the night. If we find people sleeping, we just place a blanket beside them and move ahead,” Dr Naik told TOI.He said a group of women returning from a pilgrimage centre, who missed their, were found sleeping near Gol Gumbaz. “When we offered them blankets, they gave us the prasadam they had received from the temple,” Dr Naik added.Recounting the tale of a beggar who was severely injured in his leg, Dr Naik said, “I suggested that he visit the Sri Tulasi Girish Diabetes Hospital, but he refused. When, accompanied by my staff, went to meet him the next day, he was not there.”The fact that Dr Naik comes from humble origins explains his ability to empathise with those who want for basic needs. Growing up poor in Gani Tanda in Basavana Bagewadi, the hardships he endured then instilled in him a longing to help those I in need. Dr Naik has also been offering his services at a CCC for free. Dr Naik runs diabetic hospitals in Vijayapura, Bagalkot and Goa.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/doctor-helps-poor-beat-winter-chill/articleshow/89066922.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

A senior UT official said a meeting with a NGT panel is scheduled in the coming days and the UT is in process to prepare compliance report. The NGT keeps an eye on issues like solid waste management, bio-medical and e-waste management, polythene ban and air pollution. The NGT had directed the administration and the MC to complete the upgradation of all sewage treatment plants (STPs) in the city. In another matter, the NGT had even passed an order asking MCs to pay fines up to Rs 10 lakh if they fail to implement waste segregation at source. The NGT had also asked the administration to ensure its directions on plastic, bio-medical, construction and demolition waste are complied with. Besides, the NGT had also directed the administration to expedite work on the source appointment study which will help it prepare data to quantify the proportion of various elements to the overall level of air pollution. The NGT, in its previous order, had said, “Adverse entries must be made in the ACRs of the CEO of the local bodies and other senior functionaries in the department of urban development who are responsible for compliance of the order of this tribunal.” The NGT had earlier expressed concern over the implementation of the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, saying the issue of solid and liquid waste needed to be taken seriously and accountability fixed and “consequences for failure clearly provided and enforced”. It was also observed that most statutory timelines have expired and directions of the Supreme Court and the tribunal to comply with Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, remain unexecuted. The court had reiterated its direction on 100% treatment of sewage entering rivers across the country; commencement of setting up of sewage treatment plants and the work of connecting all the drains and other sources of generation of sewage to the STPs must be ensured, failing which departments will have to pay a fine of Rs 5 lakh a month per drain.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/share-steps-taken-on-ngt-directives-ut-depts-told/articleshow/89066926.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

The site is one of the 15 to resettle registered street vendors by shifting them from their existing sites to commercially viable locations. The engineering department and vending cell of the civic body are in the process to finalise the modalities. Both the departments have collaborated on this new site in a manner that it can be given additional facilities like sheds or canopy to cover the areas along with better amenities like parking, toilets, proper lighting and iron railing to facilitate both vendors and customers. The move to provide a shed or canopy is being considered for the first time. But the plan will be sent to the urban planning department of the UT administration for approval. “The plan is at an initial stage. Discussions have begun to develop it as a unique and different kind of a vending zone, which can be further replicated at other sites too. It is for the first time that area of Mauli Jagran is being considered in the resettlement of the existing vendors. A decision on the remaining sites will be taken in the coming days. Things could not move ahead due to the MC elections, but the work will now gain pace,” sources in the MC said. The MC had recently prepared a layout plan of 15 zones to resettle 1,100 registered vendors by shifting them. The new vending zones had been identified in sectors 19, 20, 24, 41, 45 and 52 and Ram Darbar, Manimajra and Mauli Jagran. Out of these areas, maximum vendors would be resettled in Ram Darbar, Manimajra and Mauli Jagran.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/next-vending-zone-eyes-few-firsts/articleshow/89066927.cms||Deepak Yadav

---||Chandigarh||Flaws mar UT teachers’ master cadre seniority list||Poviet KaurChandigarh: The list of possible master cadre seniority of teachers released by the UT education department also names retired employees. The date of joining and department of a large number of teachers is also incorrect. The department has sought objections from teachers in this regard in 15 days. The UT had abolished two seniority lists on the orders of Punjab and Haryana High Court and issued a single seniority list.The list released by the UT shows that most of the teachers' schools have been relocated. Many teachers have objected to inaccuracies in their educational records. They also complained of repeated inaccuracies in the seniority list and demanded its revision.Punjab and Haryana High Court ordersAccording to the records of the Secretariat, it has also come to light that language teachers Neelam Rani and Sweety Badwal had filed a petition in the Punjab and Haryana High Court in 2014 seeking C&V and master cadre. Two seniority lists were drawn up despite them having the same educational qualifications, after which the court issued an order on December 16, 2016 saying that two seniority lists could not be drawn. The court asked Punjab government to issue a joint list by September 2017. Thereafter, Punjab compiled the list in December 2017 and sent a copy to the Chandigarh DPI for a joint seniority list.Glaring anomaliesSerial number 238 in the master cadre seniority list shows Hindi teacher Mandeep Singh, who has been absconding for the last one and a half years after being accused of killing his wife. Teachers said it was gross negligence on the part of the department to retain a teacher who has been missing for one and a half years in the seniority list.Serial number 21 in the seniority list shows Manmohan Singh in Government Model High School, Sector 37, who was transferred to Government Model School, Sector 23 six years ago. These days, he is the head of Government High School, Malwa. Serial No 7 in the seniority list is Harmanit Kaur who was shown in Government High School, Sector 24 even as she is currently school principal of Government Model High School, Sector 43.Talking to TOI, Palika Arora, director, higher education said, “ A few mistakes have come to our notice and we have asked teachers to notify these. In 15 days, we will recheck and release the updated list.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/flaws-mar-ut-teachers-master-cadre-seniority-list/articleshow/89066931.cms||---

The instructions were issued after the recent review meeting, in which progress of solar plants installation in Chandigarh was reviewed. UT is planning to install solar plants on spaces available with the departments. The ministry of new and renewable energy had enhanced the city’s solar power generation target from 50 megawatt (MW) to 69MW, to be achieved by 2022. Till date UT has achieved generation of 46MW. Recently, the Joint Electricity Regulatory Commission (JERC) had also turned down UT administration’s plea of implementing Resco (Renewable Energy Service Company) model for solar plants installation in city. The Chandigarh Renewable Energy and Science and Technology Promotion Society (Crest), had moved JERC for implementing Resco model in city. Crest, project's nodal agency, had proposed this model after the approval of the former UT administrator V P Singh Badnore as residents were wary of the initial capital investment. Under the Resco model, the UT had planned that private companies will install solar-energy plants on private property, and in return, charge thebuilding owner a much lower tariff (Rs 3.44 per unit) than the normal electricity rate (Rs 2.75 to Rs 5.20) for about 15 years (or whatever period is agreed in the tender). Thereafter, the house owner will get the plant. The building owner and the private company will sign a deal. The plant will be installed under the net metering mode, whereby a solar-energy unit is connected to the building's electricity system and the solar energy exported to the grid is adjusted in terms of units imported from the electricity department during a billing cycle.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/give-details-of-space-to-install-solar-plants-admn-tells-depts/articleshow/89066938.cms||---

Justice Chandra Dhari Singh recently allowed the petition filed by the Delhi government seeking direction to UIDAI to disclose information on the Aadhaar card holders sought by an investigation agency for probe of a case. The case was lodged by the anti-corruption branch for the alleged offences of criminal conspiracy under the Indian Penal Code and the Prevention of Corruption Act. “This court is inclined to allow the instant petition. The respondent (UIDAI) is hereby directed to provide all relevant information, qua the persons named in annexure… of the petition, as required for the purposes of investigation as per the provisions of the Aadhaar Act. The investigation agency is also directed to investigate the matter, upon receiving the requested information, with due regard to the provisions of the statute,” the court noted in its order. The ACB said it received a complaint from Vijender Gupta stating that the manner of recruitment of marshals for DTC buses was illegal. It was further alleged that the recruitment process was manipulated and the district magistrate had issued fake certificates, certifying as Delhi residents for making Aadhaar cards, to over 400 people from his home state Rajasthan and had compelled them to pay Rs 2 lakh per head. On the basis of the complaint, an FIR was lodged in January 2020. The prosecutor submitted before the court that the then district magistrate had committed criminal misconduct by abusing official position as public servant with an ulterior motive to give benefit to ineligible people, and in total, around 450 candidates with fake Aadhaar cards had enrolled for training in Civil Defence. The counsel for UIDAI submitted that the authority has no objection in sharing the information being sought, to the extent and in a manner as permissible under the provisions of the Aadhaar Act, on being directed by this court.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/hc-seeks-aadhaar-info-in-selection-case/articleshow/89066101.cms||TNN

The complainant, scientist Joe D’Souza, has now approached the National Green Tribunal (NGT) challenging GCZMA’s order. The tribunal has issued notices in the matter to the state government, directing it to submit its reply affidavit within six weeks. NGT will now hear the matter on March 21. In his application, D’Souza said the construction of the terminal building is in violation of CRZ regulations as it is on riverine land on the banks of the Mandovi. He has sought that the permissions granted for the construction be revoked. He has also asked the Tribunal to direct state authorities to restore the riverine land and the reclaimed portion of the river back to its original position. Goa officials should also be refrained from carrying out any further construction activity in the area, the applicant has told the tribunal. Earlier, D’Souza had approached the high court in the matter, following which GCZMA was asked by the court to examine the plaint. While hearing the matter, GCZMA also carried out an inspection of the construction of the terminal building in May 2021. In its hearing on June 10, GCZMA said that the construction was in no way affecting the flow of the Mandovi and therefore, there was no need to stop the work. “Since the terminal building would be on an elevated platform, the possibility of obstruction to the flow of water currents is ruled out,” GCZMA had said. It said that the terminal building would act as a foreshore facility which is permissible activity as per CRZ notification 2011, as the area where the building was coming up was a notified port. “The CRZ notification speaks about environment impact assessment studies to be done with built up area of any structure beyond 20,000 sqm. ln this case, the terminal building has a lesser area,” GCZMA had said. The complainant said the construction of the terminal building is in violation of CRZ regulations. The tribunal has issued notices in the matter to the state government, directing it to submit its reply affidavit within six weeks. NGT will now hear the matter on March 21||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/green-tribunal-seeks-govts-say-over-terminal-building-on-mandovis-bank/articleshow/89066025.cms||---

He also accused Solanki of transferring the money received from the firms to his own bank account using Makwana’s mobile payment application. Accused Solanki is yet to be arrested, said the police.According to case details, Solanki had approached Makwana in September last year and helped him open his mobile payments account. Later, Solanki contacted Makwana after a couple of weeks and told him about a personal loan offer. Makwana wanted to avail Rs 50,000 loan, but Solanki said that the offer was for Rs 1.2 lakh. They mutually agreed that Makwana will keep the Rs 50,000 while the remaining Rs 70,000 will remain with Solanki. But when the finance firm started calling for payment of EMIs, Makwana contacted Solanki and demanded the money back. After delaying for a couple of months, Solanki met Makwana in December at his shop and asked him to give his mobile phone to transfer the money to his account.But instead of transferring the money, Solanki used Makwana’s bank details to avail instant online personal loans from four different firms. Once the money got credited into Makwana’s account, Solanki transferred the money to his own bank account. Solanki did this when Makwana had left his mobile phone with him for about an hour.A few days later Makwana started receiving loan repayment messages , but Solanki, meanwhile, went underground and could not be reached. Makwana, therefore, filed a cheating FIR.Investigation revealed that Solanki had used a similar method to cheat a trader in Rajkot too, said police.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/agent-avails-personal-loan-on-app-in-traders-name/articleshow/89066944.cms||---

Taking a jibe at the opposition parties, Yogi said, “We have told them that now, even Kashmir is becoming a heaven in India and west UP is developing like never before. An ATS commando training centre is also coming up in Deoband.” Attacking Samajwadi Party (SP) candidates at the event, Yogi said, "Those fielded by SP are goons. Criminals have been shown the doors of jail since BJP came to power in the state. Now, they are either in jail or have left the state." He also took potshots at the opposition for announcing freebies to lure voters. “When there is no electricity, what bill are they going to waive off and from where they will give you free units? Everyone knows the condition of electricity supply in the state before 2017,” Yogi added. The CM said that when the BJP government came to power, "we first decided to stop slaughterhouses, effectively implement an anti-Romeo squad for the safety of sisters and daughters and waive off Rs 36,000 crore loans of the farmers". The CM also went on a door-to-door campaign in the town. He distributed leaflets to voters and urged them to come out and vote on February 10, the day of the first phase of the state polls.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/yogi-rakes-up-exodus-says-they-wanted-to-create-kashmir-in-kairana/articleshow/89065417.cms||---

Justice G R Swaminathan sought a response from the police, while hearing the petition filed by K Selvakumar, 72. According to the prosecution, three students were killed and four students sustained injuries after the toilet wall collapsed on December 17. Based on a complaint by the revenue inspector Maridurai, the Tirunelveli junction police registered a case under Section 304 (II) ( culpable homicide not amounting to murder) of IPC. The petitioner was arrayed as the first accused. The headmistress and contractor were arrayed as second and third accused respectively. The petitioner stated that he was appointed as the correspondent only three months prior to the incident. The compound wall was constructed in 2007 and collapsed after 14 years. He stated that several parts of the state including Tirunelveli witnessed heavy rainfall and the wall might have collapsed as a result of it. He stated that regular inspections were conducted periodically as per the regulations and the school was having a valid stability certificate. That apart, the school also had the no objection certificate issued by the fire and rescue services department. As a correspondent, he acted as an intermediary between the students and the management and was in no way responsible for the incident. Hence, he moved the HC.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/wall-collapse-school-correspondent-moves-hc-to-quash-fir/articleshow/89066960.cms||---

The matter is related to Halkori Sah High School, a co-ed government school in Manjhi block of the district. The irregularities in funds utilisation were detected by the new headmaster, Rais-ul-Ehrar Khan, who informed the district magistrate about the discrepancies in the last three financial statement records of the school. Saran district education officer (DEO) Ajay Kumar Singh told this newspaper on Saturday that the principal wrote a letter to the DM stating that several boys of the school were allotted funds for the sanitary napkin and dress scheme before 2019. “A two-member committee comprising district programme officer Rajan Kumar Giri and DPO (establishment) Sunil Kumar Gupta has been formed to investigate the matter and submit the findings within a week,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/sanitary-napkins-for-boys-put-saran-govt-school-under-lens/articleshow/89066961.cms||---
---||Madurai||Focus on suicide, not person who took video: Madras HC to cops||MADURAI: Restraining the police from harassing the person who had taken the video of the 17-year-old Class XII girl from Thanjavur in which she alleged that she was called upon to convert to Christianity, Madras high court on Saturday observed that the focus of the police should be on the circumstances that led to her suicide and not the person who had taken the video. Justice G R Swaminathan passed the interim order at a special sitting on Saturday after petitioner S Muruganantham’s (girl’s father) counsel stated that police were trying to take action against the person who took the video for revealing the identity of the minor girl. Muruganantham has sought CB-CID probe in the case. When the case was taken up on Friday evening, it had ordered forensic autopsy and to videograph the procedure. The court also asked the police to conduct themselves appropriately in view of the petitioner’s submission that police were pressuring the parents of the deceased and the person who took the video. Subsequently, the additional public prosecutor informed the court registry that postmortem had already been performed. The police wanted to know if the court had ordered a second postmortem. At the special sitting on Saturday, Justice Swaminathan took note of the fact that the postmortem was conducted by two forensic doctors of Thanjavur medical college hospital. Since nothing has been brought out to doubt its credibility, the judge requested the petitioner to receive the body and perform the final rites, which the petitioner also agreed to do. The judge directed the Thanjavur district collector to make appropriate arrangements to take the girl’s body to the petitioner’s native village and that final rites be performed without police interference. The judge directed Thanjavur principal district judge to nominate a judicial magistrate for recording the petitioner and his wife’s statement under Section 164 of Cr P C on Sunday. A copy of it shall be made available in a sealed cover to the court by Monday. Muruganantham said in his petition that hostel warden Sagayamary harassed his daughter by giving punishment work such as to clean cooking utensils, toilets, the school campus and to cook food in the hostel without being allowed to go home even during holidays. He said his daughter died by suicide only because of this torture meted out by the school management following her refusal for religious conversion. Thanjavur district superintendent of police had stated that there was no complaint of forcible religious conversion. He said the SP’s statement and the compulsion by the police created strong suspicion that the police were trying to protect those responsible for his daughter’s death. The case was adjourned to January 24 for further hearing.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/focus-on-suicide-not-person-who-took-video-hc-to-cops/articleshow/89066962.cms||Kaushik Kannan
---||Patna||Council polls: Tussle in NDA continues||Patna: An intense tussle continues among the NDA allies in Bihar over the seat-sharing issue for the 24 legislative council seats from the local authorities’ constituencies. The council election is likely to be held in February-March. While the big brother BJP has announced to contest its 13 sitting seats, JD(U) wants 12 seats on the basis of the previous 50:50 formula of seat-sharing with the saffron party. As Union minister Pashupati Kumar Paras-led Rashtriya Lok Janshakti Party (RLJP) has staked its claim on at least two seats, including Vaishali, former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi-led HAM(S) also wants to contest from Gaya and Sitamarhi constituencies.In the last elections for 24 council seats held in July 2015, the BJP had won 11 seats, JD(U) five, RJD four, LJP one, Congress one and Independent two seats. But later, one of the independents, Ashok Kumar Agarwal (Katihar), and LJP’s lone MLC Nutan Singh joined the BJP, taking its total number to 13. Similarly, RJD’s three MLCs — Radha Charan Sah (Bhojpur-Buxar)), Dilip Rai (Sitamarhi-Sheohar) and Sanjay Prasad (Muger) joined JD(U), taking its number to eight. Congress MLC Rajesh Ram (West Champaran) also joined JD(U). “In the last Lok Sabha and Bihar assembly polls, the BJP and JD(U) shared seats on 50:50 formula. We want that formula to continue. JD(U) should be allowed to contest at least 12 seats,” a senior JD(U) leader told TOI, adding the final decision on seat-sharing would be taken by CM Nitish Kumar and the party chief Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan.“The erstwhile LJP had contested four seats of Vaishali, Saharsa-Madhepura-Supaul, Nalanda and Bhojpur-Buxar in 2015. LJP’s Nutan Singh had won the Saharsa-Madhepura-Supaul seat. Though we had contested four seats, this time we are demanding just two. Vaishali is a traditional seat of LJP. We want one more seat for our senior leader Surajbhan Singh,” RLJP national spokesperson Sharvan Kumar Agrawal told TOI on Saturday. Agarwal said RLJP national president Pashupati Kumar Paras recently met senior BJP leader and Union minister Bhupender Yadav and conveyed his party’s desire to contest at least two council seats.“Manjhi has demanded two seats -- Gaya and Sitamarhi-Sheohar – to contest,” HAM(S) spokesperson Danish Rizwan told TOI over phone.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/council-polls-tussle-in-nda-continues/articleshow/89066964.cms||Madan Kumar
---||Bareilly||Seeking justice for their brothers’ ‘murder’, two take poll plunge in Lakhimpur Kheri||Bareilly: Rajeev Gupta, 47, and Pawan Kashyap, 26, say they're on a quest to "avenge" their brothers' deaths by making a debut in battleground Nighasan in the upcoming assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh. Their siblings were allegedly murdered in the year 2000 and 2021 respectively in Lakhimpur Kheri. The common link between the two incidents: allegations against Union minister Ajay Mishra Teni. Rajeev's brother Prabhat Gupta was allegedly killed due to an old business rivalry and the Union minister was accused of the crime. Meanwhile, Pawan accused Teni's son Ashish of murdering his brother, journalist Raman Kashyap, by running over him with his convoy in Tikunia during the farmers' protest in Lakhimpur Kheri last year. Pawan, an OBC, was recently offered a Congress ticket from the constituency while Rajeev, who is considered close to Shivpal Yadav, is in talks with the Samajwadi Party (SP).Rajeev's brother Prabhat, a local entrepreneur, was killed in a busy marketplace in July 2000. In 2004, a sessions court in Kheri acquitted Teni and the victim’s kin approached the high court (HC) challenging the verdict. In 2018, the Allahabad HC reserved its judgment in the case but it is yet to be delivered. If fielded by SP, Rajeev is expected to make the contest tougher for BJP's sitting MLA Shashank Verma in Nighasan, an OBC-dominated constituency. Rajeev told TOI, “I have been fighting for justice for 22 years. My brother was murdered in broad daylight and there were 15 witnesses who initially recorded their statements against Teni but he was never arrested. A few witnesses turned hostile during the trial. My case has been pending in the HC since 2004 and it is not even getting listed for hearing. This has forced me to approach the apex court.” He added, "I am seeking a ticket from SP from Nighasan because I want to rid the area of goons. It is one of the most backward areas of the state and is deprived of basic facilities. I want to ensure that people stop living in fear and get basic amenities."Meanwhile, Pawan said, “My life has changed since the death of my brother during the farmers' protest. I am a common man, a farmer, who wanted to live a peaceful life but now I want to contest elections and eradicate hooliganism from the area.” Nighasan constituency has nearly 3.8 lakh voters. Of the total, OBCs constitute about 30% and play a significant role. There are 22% Dalit voters and 15% Muslim voters. Incidentally, only one upper-caste politician has managed to secure the Nighasan seat in the past 25 years. This was Ajay Mishra Teni, who was elected from the constituency in 2012. In 2017, BJP's Ramkumar Verma won the polls.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/seeking-justice-for-their-brothers-murder-two-take-poll-plunge-in-lakhimpur-kheri/articleshow/89066965.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

It is affecting our own image and also of the party,” Singh said, adding it was the message and feeling of the legislature group that he wanted to give to Sahani. He said the VIP legislature party is not on the verge of split.While the BJP had given 11 seats to the VIP to contest during the 2020 assembly elections, its four candidates won – late Musafir Paswan (Bochaha), Raju Kumar Singh (Sahebganj), Mishri Lal Yadav (Alinagar) and Swarna Singh (Gaura Bauram). Paswan died recently, and, therefore, the byelection to the Bochaha seat is awaited.“We are a product of the anti-Lalu and anti-RJD line that emerged in the state in the 1990s, when people of the state started opposing the jungle raj that marked their rule,” he said.Singh added he has sought an appointment with Sahani for discussions on this and other aspects, including the party’s decision to contest the assembly elections in UP.

According to health experts, drop in temperature brings fever and viral infections, putting the immune system at work. Hence, one’s immunity needs to be stronger for protection against any infection.Even though many people store all types of medicines, including vitamins and minerals, to be used in case of getting infected, it is always better to boost the immunity through a balanced diet. Proper diet and nutrition are one of the things that can help gain good immunity, they say.Dr Satish Kumar of Nalanda Medical College and Hospital’s medicine department said people should take sufficient amounts of seasonal fruits and vegetables to boost their immunity.“Fruits like orange, lemon, guava and kiwi, which are good sources of vitamin C, help in the development of white blood cells which helps the body fight infections during winters,” he said, adding that seasonal fruits and vegetables which contain vitamins E, A and C should be taken regularly.According to paediatrician Dr Arun Shah, one need not unnecessarily consume pills of vitamins and minerals to boost immunity. He stressed on maintaining a routined life and having a balanced diet to strengthen the immune system. Dr Shah regretted that according to a national health survey, 40% of our children below 5 years are malnourished as they do not get a balanced diet owing to poverty and ignorance. “The current pandemic has further deteriorated the economic condition of a vast section of the population. Hence, children should be given what is locally available, affordable and accessible for boosting their immunity,” he added.Dr Gangadhar Singh of Government Ayurvedic College Hospital-Patna said besides consuming citrus fruits people must also include garlic, ginger, spinach and honey in their daily diet to boost immunity. “Garlic prevents cognitive damage, strengthens immunity and also helps fight various types of cancers,” he said.Dr Singh further pointed out that ginger has oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties which help cure the sore throat in winters. The anti-microbial property of ginger helps the body fight against germs, viruses and bacterias which are the main causes of sickness during winter.“Easily available in winter, spinach is rich in beta-carotene, antioxidants and vitamin C. It is also rich in vitamin A and vitamin E which helps fight infections and replenish the white blood cells. Furthermore, raw honey has anti-inflammatory, anticancer and anti-microbial properties. It helps keep throat infections and bronchial asthma at bay during winters,” he added.Government Ayurvedic College Hospital-Darbhanga principal Dr Dineshwar Prasad recommended consumption of whole grains like wheat, brown rice and oats and locally available pulses.“Consumption of seasonal fruits and vegetables besides almonds and fish may also strengthen one’s immune system,” Prasad said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/consume-seasonal-veggies-fruits-to-boost-immunity/articleshow/89066984.cms||---

---||Patna||Amid Covid curbs, Patna schools ready to hold exams online||PATNA: With the state government extending Covid restrictions and uncertainties prevailing over reopening of educational institutions even in February, several schools in the city have started making preparations to hold online annual examinations. School authorities said they would switch to online exams if the restrictions are further expanded in view of Covid pandemic. Most schools in the city conduct final exams in February and start the new academic session in April. Fr Christu Savarirajan SJ, principal of St Xavier’s High School, said the school administration has made all necessary arrangements to hold online examinations. “We are still hoping that the schools will reopen before the commencement of final examinations. However, if the need arises, we are ready to hold examinations online,” he added. Principal of St Karen’s High School, Seema Singh, said the school would conduct examinations in virtual mode for classes up to IX and XI with the help of its own software. “Teachers will upload the question paper to the software and the link will be sent to the students at a particular time. The students will have to answer both objective and subjective questions within a limited time. For subjective, they will have to answer in their copies and upload the image to the link,” she said. Singh added monitoring of students in online exams was quite difficult even if the cameras are on as there is always a blind spot that cannot be monitored. “There are limitations of online exams, but something is better than nothing,” she said. Ashfaque Iqbal, vice-principal of Bishop Scott Boy’s School, said the school was ready for both online and offline annual exams. “Teachers have completed the syllabi and started taking revision classes. We are awaiting further guidelines from the government before taking a call on final exams. Offline mode is always a better option. However, we are ready to hold online exams too,” he said. Mary Alphonsa, principal of Don Bosco Academy, said, “There is still time for the annual exams and we are waiting for the government’s decision. If the Covid restrictions are further extended, we will have no choice but to hold online exams.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/amid-covid-curbscity-schools-ready-tohold-exams-online/articleshow/89066987.cms||---
---||Delhi||No time to ready new Delhi University structure: Teachers||NEW DELHI: Teachers have expressed several concerns with the draft curriculum framework for undergraduate courses under the National Education Policy that Delhi University uploaded for suggestions on Friday.  For many of them, it is unrealistic to think of preparing a new structure and new syllabus in the few months left for the start of the 2022 academic session when the university plans to implement the four- year undergraduate programme. Pankaj Garg, mathematics teacher at Rajdhani College, said, “The new framework proposes an increase in the number of core papers from the existing 14 to 20 and has reduced the credit of each paper to four from the existing six. These imply a major revamp of the courses. Such revamps entail processes that require numerous meetings. Where is the need to implement these things in a hurry? Till today, the framework hasn’t even been finalised, when will the syllabus be made?” Garg feels the process of framing the syllabus is going to take more than a year. The last Academic Council meeting passed a framework with 14 core papers. Not only the core papers, but the credits for generic elective courses (GEC) too have been reduced as have the ability enhancement courses (AEC). “For AEC, the credits have been reduced to two from four. That is certainly going to affect the workload with substantive reduction,” said political science teacher Rajesh Jha. “In this framework, the discipline specific elective and GEC are also optional. Talking about workload, even for the three-year programme the overall credits has come down to 132 from 148.” Debraj Mookerjee, head of English department at Ramjas College, said the options of courses being provided for students actually dilute education. “Children have just cleared Class XII and are at an age when they are confused about a course to pursue, engineering or liberal arts or commerce. Here you are giving them so many additional options. In theory it sounds great, but what is the real value offered by these choices? Is it enhancement of knowledge or, in effect, a dilution? I would say it is dilution. Choices must be meaningful. In this case, they aren’t,” said Mookerjee. He also questioned the multiple entry/exit system and said it appeared to be a way of saying that those students who couldn’t afford to study for four years, perhaps due to financial constraint, would only get a lower degree. “Above all,” added Mookerjee, “do we have the infrastructure to manage all this? Who will be responsible for the academic administration of the system? Do departments in DU and the colleges have secretariats because when you have a complex system you need secretariats to manage things.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/no-time-to-ready-new-du-structure-teachers/articleshow/89066118.cms||Shradha Chettri

The seat once happened to be the seat of her father Vinay Shakya. Vinay Shakya, who with the OBC leader Swami Prasad Maurya had deserted the BJP, is preparing to contest the election from this seat on SP ticket.Vinay’s daughter Riya has been levelling allegations that her father is suffering from paralysis, and that her uncle Devesh Shakya and grandmother Draupadi have forcibly made her father join the Samajwadi Party. BJP has almost played a gamble of ensuring defeat of Vinay Shakya in his own stronghold by giving ticket to his rebel daughter Riya, who is an amateur in politics and is contesting election for the first time.Among the candidates announced so far, Riya Shakya, 25, is the youngest candidate. She received her education in a boarding school in Dehradun. Apart from this, she has studied Bachelor and Design from Symbiosis University, Pune. She hogged the limelight after a video of her went viral wherein she alleged that her uncle Devesh Shakya had forcibly made her father Vinay Shakya join the SP. She had said that her family is and will remain in the BJP.She also said that her father is paralyzed and her uncle and grandmother have taken him to Lucknow. The police however had termed the allegations baseless and said Vinay Shakya is at his ancestral residence in Etawah, and all the allegations are wrong.Her father’s wish was that she should enter politics, Riya said. “He suffered a brain stroke in 2018 and since then he has been ailing from various complications. Had he been able to think properly, he would not have left BJP,” she further said.If SP gives ticket to Vinay Shakya, then an interesting contest is expected between father and daughter. At the same time, if her uncle Devesh Shakya gets the ticket, then this match will be of uncle vs niece. The Bidhuna assembly seat in Auraiya comes under the Kannauj parliamentary seat. At one time Vinay Shakya was considered very special and trustworthy of BSP supremo Mayawati. Vinay Shakya first came into the limelight when he defeated former assembly speaker Dhaniram Verma from Bidhuna in 2002, but when Vinay lost the assembly elections in 2007, Mayawati then made him an MLC. In 2009, BSP had fielded Vinay from Mainpuri Lok Sabha seat against the then SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav but he suffered a defeat.The SP captured the Bidhuna seat in 2007 and 2012 assembly elections. However, in the Modi wave of 2017, Vinay Shakya won this seat by defeating Dinesh Kumar Verma of SP.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kanpur/father-preparing-to-contest-against-daughter-from-bidhuna-in-auraiya/articleshow/89066994.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

Importantly, the incident occurred near the Municipal Corporation Zone-D office during night curfew hours.Division number 5 police have lodged an FIR against three accused who are yet to be identified. The incident occurred when Naman Garg, 20, of Bharat Nagar chowk, along with his friend Kush Verma, 20, of Cemetery road, was waiting for a food parcel in his Swift Dzire (PB10GL8492).Sub-inspector Neeraj Chaudhary, SHO, Division number 5 police station, said, “Naman along with his friend had gone out for dinner. After finding the restaurants closed, they ordered food from an online food delivery service. Since Naman had updated his live location near MC Zone-D office, they were asked to stay at their location to receive the food parcel.”“The duo was sitting in the car when three motorcycle-borne men stopped near them. Carrying sharp-edged weapons, the trio threatened them to hand over the car keys and get out of the car. Out of fear, the youngsters did not put up resistance. The duo contacted their family members and called up cops,” the SHO added. The miscreants also took away Rs 4,000 and Naman’s mobile phone. Asked about if victims would be taken to task for violating orders regarding the night curfew, the SI said, “Actually, there was some confusion over the timing of restaurants in the city on Friday. Some orders were mistakenly issued that the restaurants may open till 11.30pm which also got circulated and also found mention in a section of media. So the victims were in the impression that the restaurants would be open. However, when they found restaurants in Sarabha Nagar closed, they ordered food online.”On the suspicion of the involvement of the food delivery boy, the official said nothing of that sort has been found in the initial probe.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/duo-loses-car-cash-as-thieves-strike-during-night-curfew/articleshow/89066998.cms||---

While the normal rainfall is 28.3mm, the district had recorded 83.6mm rainfall in 1992, according to the data of department of climate change and agricultural meteorology of Punjab Agricultural University (PAU). Punjab Agricultural University observatory was set up in 1970 and the meteorological data has been recorded since then.On Saturday, the district was reeling under a cold spell on account of 5mm rainfall. The maximum temperature stayed at 14.4°C and minimum was 9.6°C. K K Gill, principal agrometeorologist from the department of climate change and agricultural meteorology, PAU, said, “The rain spell has extended in the fourth week of January which has never happened in past 50 years. The spell has occurred due to western disturbances. The long cold spell witnessed zero sunshine days for 12 consecutive days and the temperature dipped to as low as 11.5 degrees which is 8 degrees below normal.”She said, “The continuous cold spell and no sunshine days have affected crops majorly. The crop has started yellowing due to the absence of sunlight. As photosynthesis did not take place, crops are not growing properly. Even food crops, fruits and vegetables have also been affected with stagnant growth.”Prabhjot Kaur Sidhu, professor and head of department of climate change and agricultural meteorology of PAU, said, “An active western disturbance has arrived, assisted by induced cyclonic circulation. It has spread and intensified, galloping across the north region. This is due to low pressure activity which moves from Pakistan, Afghanistan area and it influences the whole of north India. Peak activity of rainfall is expected on Sunday (January 23) and would start diminishing thereafter.

---||Ludhiana||‘Toughest-to-please’ seat has voted twice for Cong||Ludhiana: Their constituency has the highest population density in the district, so the voters of Ludhiana Central are toughest to please. The performances of the elected representatives come under intense public scrutiny in this assembly seat. This constituency was part of Ludhiana East segment when the first election for it was held in 2012. The seat is represented by Surinder Kumar Dawar of the Congress, who has won it on both occasions there was an election for it. However, Dawar has been legislator three times, twice from Ludhiana Central and once from Ludhiana East, that’s when Ludhiana Central was part of that constituency. In 2017, Dawar again won the seat for the Congress by defeating the Bharatiya Janata Party candidate Gurdev Sharma Debi by more than 20,000 votes. Dawar polled 47,871 votes, while Debi received 27,391. Vipan Sood Kaka of the-then alliance between the Lok Insaf Party (LIP) and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) finished third with 25,001 votes. With another election due next month, many voters have raised demand for better roads and education. The data from the 2017 elections suggests that of the 1,47,646 electors in this assembly segment, 1,03,012 had turned out to vote, which makes a voting percentage of 69.77. Voter Shiv of Iqbal Ganj Chowk area said: "I am satisfied with the state of roads in the constituency and see no problem area." Voter Gurpreet Singh of Field Ganj said: "The roads can be better, and even the traffic management and parking systems have a scope of improvement. The healthcare system should be improved as well, while the constituents of Ludhiana Central also need parks in the area for recreation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/toughest-to-please-seat-has-voted-thrice-for-cong/articleshow/89067006.cms||Shariq Majeed

In his police complaint, the girl’s father had mentioned that one day prior to the complaint, his son had informed him that he was having pain in his private part. Later, he disclosed how the man, who used to work as a watchman in the school, followed him to the bathroom and committed the crime. Following a complaint to the police, the watchman was arrested. Later, police filed a chargesheet against him in the court.The court said, “Solitary testimony of the victim is sufficient to establish the allegations without any corroboration.

---||Ludhiana||Amarinder’s men likely to be fielded from BJP||Ludhiana: Ever since the Bharatiya Janata Party declared its candidates for five of the 14 assembly seats in this district, the remaining hopefuls are on the edge. Sources say that at least three of PLC’s men are likely to be fielded from the BJP.The party insiders claim that picking the candidates took a while because a seat-sharing formula was being worked out with allies Punjab Lok Congress of Captain Amarinder Singh and Shiromani Akali Dal (Sanyukt) of Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa. The sources also claimed that the BJP was keen to spare three seats for the PLC if its candidates agreed to contest under the BJP’s flag.The names of those constituencies are yet to be announced but, at the moment, East and North are from where the PLC is keen to contest. For the Ludhiana North seat, the BJP has contenders such as Jeevan Gupta, Anil Sarin, and Mahesh Datt Sharma. Its state party vice-president, Parveen Bansal, who earlier sought ticket from Ludhiana Central, wants another ticket from North, from where he contested twice—in 2012 and 2017—and lost. Asked about it, Bansal said: "The decision to field anyone or not rests with the BJP leadership, but if the party gives me a chance, I am ready to deliver good results this time."However, another ticket aspirant for North, Anil Sarin, said: "I wait for the second list to be able to begin with my election campaign, since our rivals have a head start over us. We have to support the party, whoever the candidate from any seat." BJP district president Pushpinder Singhal said: "The second list is expected anytime, as regular meetings are on in Delhi and there will be more clarity within a couple of days."Keemti Rawal, whom the Punjab Lok Congress has given charge of the North constituency, said: "The alliance is working to give winnable fresh faces to the voters. The picture will become clear shortly." Beating the speculation of a pre-poll alliance with the Lok Insaaf Party of MLA Simarjit Singh Bains, the BJP on Friday fielded a candidate for Gill, a seat that the LIP had wanted.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/amarinders-men-likely-to-be-fielded-from-bjp/articleshow/89067010.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: From war of words to fisticuffs, all because of the humble mask||PUNE: It is not unusual to see people breaking into an argument or getting into fisticuffs over wearing of face masks, which essentially prevent the spread of coronavirus. At the RTO office, a war of words broke out recently when an elderly man told a strapping youth ahead of him in the queue to mask up. The youngster said he had been wearing the face covering for nearly an hour and pulled it down to get some fresh air. When the elderly man tried to tell him that he should wear mask for his own safety, the youngster turned around and abused him roundly. When a couple of others tried to calm him down, he announced that he would not wear mask at all. Since the pandemic started, and the government authorities started mandating face covering, masks have become the new flashpoint, triggering arguments and confrontations that have sometimes resulted in police complaints, and even breakups. At a few housing societies, wearing of face masks has raised a storm in a teacup at the annual general body meetings, with some members objecting to security guards ticking them off for not wearing face covering. Kamakshi Agarwal, a resident of Lulla Nagar, said that she broke up with her close friend for over 15 years over the issue of wearing masks. “On our school friends’ group on social media, there was a discussion on the importance of wearing masks in the wake of rising cases and I had said that precaution was better than cure. But my friend argued that wearing of masks was not a solution since many people were getting infected anyway. The argument continued for a while following which she told me bluntly that she was not interested in speaking to me. She then blocked my phone number.” At restaurants, too, the issue of not wearing masks has often led to quarrels. Prabhakar Reddy, a staff member at a popular restaurant on F C Road, said, "Patrons often take umbrage if they are told to wear the mask properly. A patron told one of our staff members that had no right to tell him to mask up since he was more educated than him." A conductor at a PMPML bus on the Hadapsar route recently had an argument with a youngster who refused to wear mask because he was sitting alone on a two-seater. "I told the youngster that he was coughing and there were many passengers on the bus. Initially, he ignored my request. When I told him the second time, he refused to cover his face. I then asked him to get down from the bus for not following the rules," the conductor said. The issue of wearing masks has even ruined relationships. Shweta Sinha, a teacher at a CBSE school in Aundh, recalled two brothers residing in her building coming to blows over wearing of face masks. "Both of them threatened to report to the police against each other. While they were coming down the staircase, they even exchanged a couple of blows. Since then the brothers have not met each other for over a year now."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/from-war-of-words-to-fisticuffs-all-because-of-the-humble-mask/articleshow/89067011.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

Grewal alleged that the SHOs of the Punjab Agricultural University, Sarabha Nagar, Haibowal, Division Number 8, and Division Number 5 police stations had been working in Ludhiana West even before a model code of conduct for the assembly elections had come into force and now they had been reshuffled within the same constituency.The SAD-BSP candidate alleged that: "All of these SHOs are under the influence of Congress candidate Bharat Bhushan Ashu, who is also a cabinet minister of Punjab, and his wife, Mamta Ashu, a councillor from Ludhiana West. There are numerous instances where these SHO went out of the way to help Punjab’s ruling party, the Congress, so free and fair elections under their watch are not possible, if they continue on their postings." He requested the CEO to post new SHOs in the constituency and ensure that they had not served in Ludhiana West for the last three years." Asked about his allegations, Grewal told TOI that: "I do not want to target anyone. All I want is free and fair elections, without the influence of anyone. These SHOs are biased towards Bharat Bhushan Ashu, so I was forced to point this out to the CEO and seek that all of them be transferred." SAD-BSP candidate Maheshinder Singh Grewal has gone to the election commission against the appointed heads of Ludhiana’s Improvement Trust and municipal corporation. He has accused Improvement Trust chairman Raman Subaramaniam of being a political appointee who only draws his pay from the public exchequer. Grewal said: "In spite of holding an official position, the LIT chief canvasses for Congress candidates openly. A few days ago, he accompanied Ashu and his wife to the Laxami Ladies Club. He is using his office for the political benefit of the Congress candidate." Grewal claimed that municipal commissioner Pardeep Sabarwal worked at the behest of Ashu and mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu, for whom he had passed cheques under public schemes to the Congress councillors after the code of conduct for the Punjab assembly elections had come into force . He wants Subaramaniam to be restrained from taking part in active campaigning and MC commissioner Pardeep Sabarwal transferred from Ludhiana. Ashu couldn't be contacted despite repeated attempts.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/grewal-asks-ceo-to-shift-5-shos-claims-they-work-for-ashu-wife/articleshow/89067012.cms||---

So testing strategies have also changed. There’s no point in just increasing testing or sequencing when strategic testing and sequencing should be the way ahead,” he said.State health minister Rajesh Tope too has said that only select samples from hospital settings should be sent for sequencing.State task force member Dr Shashank Josh said strategic testing and sequencing should be followed with more samples coming in from hospitals than the community. Monitoring of hospital samples will help determine if Omicron is sending people into specialised care. Dr Joshi said, “Our strategy is two-fold: symptom-based and syndromic. We have to test anyone with flu-like symptoms and flag the group likely to deteriorate, basically the ones with poor immunity or those with serious chronic issues,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/dont-flood-labs-with-samples-focus-on-strategic-sequencing-epidemiologist/articleshow/89067013.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The accused made his profile on the site and started targeting working women on false promise of marriage. Investigators claimed that during video calls, he took their nude pics and started blackmailing them to extort money. In a complaint, a 32-year-old woman told police that she met a person named Sahil Sachdeva, a native of Uttar Pradesh, through a matrimonial site (BetterHalf.com) in October last year. "He made false promises to marry her. On his assurance, they started building their relationship. Sachdeva took her nude pics during video calls and started blackmailing her," a police officer said. Sachdeva threatened the complainant, saying he would upload all her pics on social media platforms if she didn’t send him money. Within two months, he extorted Rs two lakh from her. During the probe, police found that the accused used to change his hideouts. "Later, he was arrested from Neb Sarai area," the officer said. “We are probing whether three more women were extorted by him," the officer said. The mobile phone having nude pics and videos of more than four girls has been recovered from his possession. Sachdeva finished his early education at a school in Saharanpur (UP). "After that, he completed his B.tech Saharanpur and MBA degree from a university in Jalandhar. He is unmarried and unemployed," the officer said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/man-dupes-women-on-marriage-site-held/articleshow/89065778.cms||---

The analysis, experts said, proves that the state has a considerably lower Covid-19 burden than others. Maharashtra’s active Covid cases per million number stands at 2,087: Karnataka has 4,381; Tamil Nadu 2,365; Kerala 5,062; Delhi 4,484; and Haryana has 2,342. Experts said calculating the number of cases per million population is the scientific way to compare statewise burden of any disease — because different states have different population sizes. “Maharashtra is the second-most populous after Uttar Pradesh. The absolute number of cases cannot convey the real picture of the disease burden. That’s why we use the per million population method. Since Maharashtra’s population is nearly 13 crore and when Covid cases are calculated per million population, the state's actual disease burden is much lower,” a state health official said. Recently, Lav Agarwal, joint secretary, Union health ministry, had said that 19 states had over 10,000 active cases. He said Maharashtra, West Bengal, Delhi, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Kerala and Gujarat were emerging as states of concern due to the rise in cases. But the state's additional chief secretary (health) Dr Pradeep Vyas said, “Maharashtra’s actual disease burden is much lower, if the number of cases are calculated per million population.” Dr Vineeta Bal, immunologist and faculty at IISER, Pune, said assessing Covid cases per million population for districts too (and not just states) can help policymakers make vital decisions. She said, “It’s not that absolute numbers aren't important; they help gauge scale of infections nationwide. But the per million population figures are more helpful at the state- and district-level because they give the real picture as against absolute numbers, which could at times create panic just by their magnitude.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/mahas-actual-covid-burden-lower-than-some-key-states/articleshow/89072445.cms||Neha Madaan

---||---||Goa polls 2022: BJP says candidates ‘best represent people’s aspirations’||PANAJI: Despite having serious criminal offences right from rape to offence against property and corruption, BJP in Goa has chosen seven of its candidates as it “firmly believes that they can best represent the aspirations of the people and share a good rapport with the people of the constituency”. The seven include Rohan Khaunte for Porvorim, Atanasio ‘Babush’ Monserrate for Panaji, revenue minister Jennifer Monserrate for Taleigao, transport minister Mauvin Godinho for Dabolim, deputy chief minister Chandrakant ‘Babu’ Kavlekar for Quepem, Govind Gaude for Priol and Krishna Salkar for Vasco. Interestingly, they have made it to BJP’s first list of 34 candidates ahead of others without criminal cases against them. The party has justified its decision by saying that they have been involved in social work and that there was no other person who could better represent the voice of the people of the area. The party’s justification about the criminal antecedents of the seven candidates has been given in a public notice as per the requirement of the Election Commission of India. The criminal cases range from offences against property, rape, damage to public property, agitation and corruption, among others. As per the party, Khaunte has been chosen as he has a two-term experience as MLA and has been minister for revenue, IT, labour and employment, and planning and statistics. Additionally, he has been awarded the ‘Adarsh Yuva Vidhayak Puraskar’. BJP has also stated that Khaunte has worked tirelessly for the underprivileged, women empowerment, students and has carried out social activities. “The chargesheet does not indicate any direct involvement of the candidate (Khaunte) for the offence charged. Documents show that he was a non-executive director who was not involved in the day-to-day affairs of the company and was not incharge and was not responsible for the conduct of the business of the company in 2009-2010. Therefore, offence against the candidate is not serious and the candidate is best available,” BJP general secretary stated in a public notice. On the party’s decision to choose the Monserrate couple, it was stated that they are very senior politicians who have been actively engaged in social service in their respective constituencies for the past many years and have been found to have a good understanding of the ground situation and share a good voter rapport. Gaude, who embraced BJP recently, was also chosen for his engagement in social service and as he is an active voice representing the interest of the ST communities in the state for the past many years. Godinho, too, made it to BJP’s first list as he was found to have a good understanding of the ground situation and shared a good rapport with his voters. Kavlekar, BJP stated it chose as he is an active social worker espousing the cause of farmers, forest dwellers and the marginalised sections of the society. He was chosen over other candidates without criminal antecedents as he has been representing the people of Quepem in the zilla panchayat as well as in the House on consecutive occasions and has been vocal for the rightful claims of the people without any gender, cast or religious bias. A new face for BJP in Vasco, Salkar’s selection was attributed to his activeness in the social and political sphere and because he has been an active voice in raising issues of political importance. “The case at hand is a politically motivated case where the accused along with the local public gheraoed the complainant. False case has been registered against the accused,” the BJP general secretary stated.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/goa/news/criminal-cases-bjp-says-candidates-best-represent-peoples-aspirations/articleshow/89083703.cms||Murari Shetye

Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director, health services, Pune region, told TOI, “During April 7-13 last year, Pune witnessed the highest cases during the second wave. Pune’s maximum requirement of oxygen then was 341 metric tonnes (MT) per day. Now, we are prepared to meet an oxygen requirement of 1,000 MT per day. At present, however, the district’s ocygen requirement is just 80-90 MT per day. Similar is the case with ICU and oxygen beds as well as ventilators, whose availability has gone up significantly since the second wave period, but requirement currently is just 3-4 % of total availability.” Dr Deshmukh said not only has the infrastructure been scaled up, but the ongoing wave being somewhat milder than the previous surge is also a reason why critical resources are more available now. Dr Dhananjay Kelkar, medical director of Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital, told TOI, “There are 22 patients in the hospital ICU but only two-three are there because of Covid. The rest have landed up in the ICU due to other illnesses “with Covid” and not because of it. The main reason behind this trend is that the variant that has triggered the current surge is relatively milder, attaching to the bronchi and not to the lung alveoli.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/pune-far-better-placed-now-than-in-2nd-wave-analysis/articleshow/89067015.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Pune||Weekly positivity rate may rise, low hospitalisation rate a relief: Maharashtra deputy CM Ajit Pawar||PUNE: Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Saturday said the district’s weekly positivity rate was on the higher side and could go up further in the next week but the low hospitalisation rate and large numbers of vacant beds in the health hubs were the reassuring factors. The state’s average weekly positivity rate (WPR) was 23% for the seven-day period ending on January 19. It was 27% in the Pune district. Ajit Pawar, citing the experts’ view, said the Covid cases were expected to increase in the Pune district in the coming week because it was yet to reach the peak. On a reassuring note, he said only 3.12% of the active Covid patients were admitted to hospitals in the district during the January 13-19 period. According to the district health department’s data, only 2,330 of the total 71,497 active Covid patients were in hospitals in the district in the week ending on January 19. After the district’s weekly Covid review meeting, Ajit Pawar said most patients were recovering in home isolation and had mild symptoms. Still, he said, he had directed the hospitals to keep all the infrastructure ready. He said the private hospitals had been told to dedicate at least one of their branches for Covid care. The deputy chief minister said the administration would continue to urge people to take both their vaccine doses because most of the establishments could function only with fully vaccinated people. He said though the government had not made it mandatory for citizens to take Covid-19 vaccine, it was trying its best to ensure that everyone took it. He directed the local authorities to ensure that precaution dose was administered to those above 60 years on weekends to avoid rush and scale up the vaccination of beneficiaries in the 15-17 years category. He also told the divisional commissioner to expand the Pune Zilla Parishad’s Covid-free village competition to other districts in the Pune division. Pune mayor Muralidhar Mohol tweeted on Saturday that gardens would remain open in the morning. The issue was discussed in the review meeting, he wrote.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/dy-cm-wpr-may-rise-low-hospitalisation-rate-a-relief/articleshow/89067016.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Pune||Pune schools not to reopen on Monday||PUNE: Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Saturday said a decision on reopening of schools in the district would be taken after monitoring the increase in Covid-19 infection rate in the next seven days. “I was of the opinion that the schools should reopen. But the health experts said the Covid-19 cases would increase in the coming days and that the detections are yet to peak. Keeping this in mind, we want to adopt a cautious approach. We will monitor the caseload in the coming week. We will take a decision on reopening of schools in Pune at the next Covid review meeting after seven days,” Pawar, who is also the guardian minister of Pune, said after the review meeting with district administration officials.  Education minister Varsha Gaikwad had announced that all schools in the district could reopen from January 24. But the final decision was supposed to be taken by the district officials, based on the local conditions. Parents, teachers and education activists are divided over the issue of school reopening at this moment. Some have been of the view that it is important to keep the schools closed till the Covid-19 cases reduce, while another section said it should be left to the parents to decide if they wanted to send their wards to school. Vasant Kalpande, an academician and former director of education, said the schools must have reopened "as the learning losses faced by students, especially those belonging to the economically and socially disadvantaged groups, is almost insurmountable". He said, "Students are now dependent on tuition classes. But how many can afford them? Urban poor students and those from lower-middle-class families are suffering. Instead of taking multiple decisions, the government should have stuck to the statewide decision of reopening schools." Aditya Vyas, an activist at Kagad Kach Patra Kashtakari Panchayat, a trade union of waste pickers and allied activities, said about 80% of the children of waste pickers either had no access or had extremely limited access to online education. "Many children from this category do not have smartphones. Even in families with a smartphone, the bread earner for the family carries the gadget while going out for work. Then there are multiple children in the same household, which means only one gets to attend his or her lessons," said Vyas. "Besides, many teachers send study material to the students in PDF files, a format that many parents or their wards from this category can understand. The closure of the schools has hampered the education of children from poor families," he said. Jyoti Bodhe, principal of New English School, Ramanbaug, said, "The schools are closed for over 1.5 years, but the academic loss is that of almost three years. Younger students are the worst affected. Besides being affected in terms of academics, we can also see changes in their behaviour, Many children have become reluctant to talk to or mingle with each other."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/pune-schools-not-to-reopen-tomorrow/articleshow/89067017.cms||Ardhra Nair

Even the local corporators had raised the issue with the civic authorities, demanding urgent repairs.The officials from the administration said that the tendering process for appointing agencies to take up the work has been initiated. The actual work is expected to begin in the next one month. The work has been proposed from Rajas society chowk to Shatrunjay Mandir chowk till Khadi Machine chowk.The PMC has been working on widening of Katraj-Kondhwa road for the last four years. The project has been on slow track because of non-availability of land. Not even 50% work has been completed so far. The work is underway in patches where the land acquisition has been completed.Yogesh Sanakar, a regular traveller said, “We were expecting a four-lane road by 2022. However, the work is still pending on a lot of stretches. The administration should now at least complete the repair of the existing road to reduce daily hardships.”Vishal Raje, a local shopowner, said, “There is a chaos all over the entire stretch. All the chowks and crossings on the stretch starting from Katraj to Khadi machine chowk witness long queues of vehicles. The widening work should have happened two years back.The Katraj-Kondhwa is a crucial road link that connects Satara road to Saswad road. The traffic on the road has gone up many fold because of spike in residential projects on both sides of the stretch. The existing road is proving insufficient.Authorities from the civic administration said that they were in talks with the landowners to complete the acquisition at the earliest. “We are negotiating with the landowners. Some have responded positively,” an official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/katraj-kondhwa-road-to-undergo-repairs-tarring-strengthening/articleshow/89067019.cms||---

Ravindra Sinha of Citizens for Area Sabha said groups of residents had approached the government soon after the standings for cleanliness were announced, questioning its methodology. “How the rankings were decided when we can see garbage dumped in our areas. Its method seems to be flawed because the real picture does not reflect in it. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has to be more prompt in dealing with garbage,” Sinha said. Vivek Velankar of Sajag Nagrik Manch said, “The rankings should reflect at the ground-level. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has still not been able to handle the daily garbage generated in the city. There is a challenge to treat garbage from the 23 newly merged villages. The processing units are not working at full capacity. PMC should conduct a detailed audit of every unit.”Ajit Deshmukh, the head of the PMC’s solid waste management department, said, “The processing of waste has gone up. There will be improvement in the days to come. The segregation has also improved. The bigger societies have been told to treat the trash within their premises.” He said there was a plan to introduce suction machines. “One machine would be deployed in each of the five civic zones. They will lift garbage from roadsides, street corners and chowks. We are also planning to set up a toll-free number so that citizens can contact our representatives for sending the suction machines to remove the unattended garbage,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/civic-activists-claim-survey-methodology-flawed/articleshow/89067020.cms||Sarang Dastane

The residents of the area and the fire brigade officials rescued the three injured men and moved them to a nearby hospital. “All the three injured workers are out of danger. We have initiated the process to register a case against the building owner, who was constructing a small room on the sixth floor, for neglecting the safety of the workers,” senior police inspector Sardar Patil of the Kondhwa police station said. Fire station duty officer Sameer Shaikh said, “The fire brigade received an emergency call at 1pm. An ambulance, a fire tender and a special van rushed to the spot for rescue and relief work. The residents of the area had gathered on the terrace of the building where the 15x10ft room was being constructed. A section of the slab had fallen on the workers, whose details are being ascertained.” He said, “The residents moved the workers to the hospital after the rescue operation. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) authorities then demolished the dangerous part of the room.” A PMC officer said, “The vehicular movement on Lane No. 3 was stopped by the time the PMC officials demolished the dangerous section of the under-construction room.” Shaikh said, “The workers were removing the support of wooden and iron pillars of the slab after it was constructed. As soon as they removed the support, the slab caved in.” The fire brigade officials had a tough time in reaching the spot owing to the narrow lanes in Shivnerinagar. Senior inspector Patil said, “The injured workers were found under the debris of the slab. We have called the building owner and the contractor to the police station for questioning. There are hardly any legal buildings in the area. We shall verify if the ongoing work and the building concerned were legal.” The eyewitnesses claimed that they heard a loud noise and rushed to the building. “We took them (workers) out and called an ambulance,” one among them said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/slab-from-room-under-construction-falls-3-injured/articleshow/89067022.cms||---

A group of teachers and students said the colleges must reopen at least for the practical sessions, while another claimed that the pupils have got the hang of online classes and that that there was no harm in continuing with the digital mode of learning at least for the next one month or till the Covid-19 cases in the city reduced. Maharashtra higher and technical education minister Uday Samant on Friday tweeted that his department had sent a proposal on reopening of the colleges to the chief minister’s office and a final decision would be taken after the CM approved the plan. Kuldeep Ambekar, a third year law student, said he wanted the colleges to reopen, but there could be some pupils who might not want that owing to the rising Covid-19 cases. The colleges must ensure the hybrid mode of learning. In colleges, there are no prescribed textbooks as such. We have to refer to different books. Buying all these books is not possible and we need the libraries. But with the colleges remaining closed, there are a lot of problems. Moreover, the way we understand topics during offline lectures cannot be compensated for in the online mode. Besides, practicals cannot be held online,” said Ambekar. A parent of a second year engineering student said she would rather have her daughter miss classes than go to the college and get exposed to the virus. “Covid cases triggered by the Omicron variant are fast increasing. Despite the maximum precautions, there are cases of infections in every housing society. My daughter is doing fine with the online classes. I think colleges should not reopen for physical classes till the Covid curve flattens,” said the parent.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/college-reopening-plan-sparks-varied-responses/articleshow/89067023.cms||Ardhra Nair

---||Pune||Pune platform ticket price hike draws flak||PUNE: The Pune railway division’s recent decision to increase the price of platform tickets to Rs50, from the earlier Rs10, to control crowd has drawn flak from citizens. “The platform ticket price was increased earlier this week and would be in effect till February 14. The idea was to discourage people from going to platforms amid the surge in Covid-19 cases. Many go to the platforms without any real purpose. The crowd at the station has been increasing and it needs to be controlled,” Manoj Jhawar, the public relations officer of the railway division, told TOI. The official said those assisting senior citizens, people with special needs and pregnant women, could buy platform tickets at increased rates from the counters.  “The official at the counter will ask the ticket buyer about the urgency of going to the platform and will only provide one ticket if the former is convinced. If the buyer doesn’t have any of the above problems, the attendants coming to drop them will not be given the ticket even if s/he is ready to pay Rs50,” Jhawar said. Harsha Shah, chairman of the Railway Pravasi Group, told TOI, “Trains are running full. Even the general compartments are full of passengers without any social distance. How will increasing the platform ticket’s rates help in crowd control? It will only increase the difficulties of the family members and friends of the passengers going to drop them. Even healthy people will face problems if their attendants are now allowed inside the platforms because many carry a lot of luggage with them.” Abhinav Kumar (48), scheduled to travel to Patna next week, said, “Often the platform in which a train is scheduled to arrive is changed at the last moment. In such a scenario, having no attendant will create a major problem for many passengers with luggage. A passenger may look fit and fine, but climbing up and down the stairs with luggage is a tedious affair. The regulation needs to be reviewed.” Another Railway official said those having confirmed tickets would only be allowed on the platforms. “Passengers should try to reach the station at least one hour before the scheduled departure of their train or even earlier. If they abide by it, they shouldn’t have problems in boarding the train without attendants. The platforms have been getting heavily crowded of late. We want to avoid a chaotic situation amid the surge in Covid cases.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/pune-platform-ticket-price-hike-draws-flak/articleshow/89067025.cms||Joy Sengupta

He became a party member after he had given the commitment for the role as an actor, the deputy chief minister said.“When I had a discussion with Kolhe about the Lok Sabha elections in 2019, he was working as an actor.

He said the project would ensure round-the-clock water supply to the villages. He said they were making efforts to supply drinking water to all the urban and rural areas in the district once every two days. “Work is on to prepare detailed project reports for a few drinking water projects to increase the supply frequency.

The project would be implemented for sure,’’ Duraimurugan said in a statement on Saturday. The 4,600 crore project was announced by chief minister M K Stalin on January 20. Inaugurating a slew of projects in Dharmapuri, Stalin said a detailed project report would be prepared for the second phase of the Hogenakkal Integrated Drinking Water project, which would supply water to Krishnagiri and Dharmapuri districts. The first phase of the drinking water project was launched by late chief minister M Karunanidhi in 2008 to provide drinking water to the two districts. Opposing the announcement, Karnakata Water Resources Minister Govind Karjol had said the neighbouring state challenge the project legally. Stating that Tamil Nadu had not placed the project before Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal or the supreme court, the Karnataka minister said that any project TN wanted to implement in Cauvery basin should only be in line with allocation of water made by the tribunal and supreme court. TN and Karnataka are already crossing swords over Mekedatu dam project, which the latter has been pushing forward. Responding to Karjol, Duraimuragan said that TN has the legal sanctity to execute the project according to Supreme court order which permitted usage of Cauvery water for essential requirement. Duraimurugan said the final award of the Cauvery Water Dispute Tribunal on February 2007 has allocated 2.2 tmc of water for consumptive use. He also noted that TN got 25.71 tmc of `balance water after considering the permitted irrigation scheme.’ Citing multiple aspects of the supreme court order and final award of the tribunal including the Clause -18, Duraimururgan said they grant rights for tapping water for drinking purposes. Rajya Sabha MP and PMK leader Anbumani Ramadoss too said that Karnataka doesn't have rights to oppose the project. “Karnataka minister wrongly understood the Apex court verdict on Cauvery tribunal’s final verdict on river Cauvery row,” Anbumani said, adding that all issues between TN and Karnataka were sorted out when the first phase of project commenced and the same conditions would be applicable to second phase also.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/duraimurugan-condemns-ktaka-for-opposing-hogenakkal-project/articleshow/89067030.cms||---

Tasmac employees said the sales had increased by more than 60% compared to normal days and they had ensured adequate stock of all liquor brands, expecting a huge crowd. The situation, they said, wasn’t any different on the past two Saturdays. B Natarajan, a resident of GN Mills, said he didn’t want to miss out on the fun with friends on Sundays. “It is the only day we can relax, and we do not want to miss out on the fun. We have purchased meat as well to have with the drinks.” A tippler, who visited a Tasmac shop at Ganapathy, said the liquor would be available in black market on Sunday. “However, only a few cheap brands will be there. Since I don’t want to compromise on my favourite brand, I have come down to the outlet to buy one.” A Tasmac employee said they had received instruction from higher authorities not to sell liquor bottles in bulk to a customer as the same would be sold in black market on Sunday at higher prices. A city police officer said they would tighten vigilance on Sunday to curb illegal sale of liquor. “More police personnel will be deployed to prevent unnecessary movement on the roads as well.” Meat and fish stalls were crowded till Saturday evening and they too recorded a good business on the day. There was a slight increase in fish prices, as demand outstripped the supply.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/tipplers-throng-tasmac-shops-to-stock-up-ahead-of-lockdown/articleshow/89067031.cms||---

Electricity minister V Senthil Balaji inaugurated the work on Saturday in the presence of district collector G S Sameeran and deputy commissioner of city corporation M Sharmila. The 2.96km stretch was damaged a few months ago, when an LPG pipeline laying work was carried out.

A DVAC sleuth said the couple had amassed 1.45 crore illegally in five years from 2011 to 2016 when 47-year-old Jayaraman last served as the chairman of No.4 Veerapandi town panchayat. “Using the money, movable and immovable properties were purchased in their names.” He said the husband-wife duo were booked under Section 13(2) read with 13(1)(e) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, on Friday. Jayaraman, a resident of Anna Nagar at Veerapandi Pudur was first elected as the chairman of No.4 Veerapandi town panchayat in 2001. He was elected for a third consecutive term in 2011. “He hails from a middle-class family and his 36-year-old wife is a homemaker,” the DVAC sleuth said. According to the first information report filed by the DVAC, Jayaraman and his wife had properties worth 1.25 crore as on October 25, 2011. Their assets grew fast and touched 3.43 crore by October 24, 2016, while the income from their known sources of income for the period was only 1.50 crore. “Considering that the couple had an expenditure of 78 lakh during the period and saved another 71 lakh, we have come to a conclusion that they had made 1, 45, 74, 040 from unknown sources of income during the period,” the source said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/town-panchayat-ex-chairman-wife-held-in-da-case/articleshow/89067033.cms||---

Leader of Opposition in Delhi Assembly, Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, asked the Delhi government to amend the provisions of Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) to pave the way for the businesses to function without any restrictions. Following LG’s directions, Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Friday allowed private offices to function with 50% attendance but decided against lifting the weekend curfew and removing restrictions on the opening of shops on an odd-even basis till the Covid situation improves further. In a letter to the LG, Gupta said trading activities were the lifeline of any city. “Due to the restrictions, the trading activities have badly suffered. Traders are suffering huge losses and thousands of people who work with them are facing salary cuts while daily wage labourers are losing their livelihood,” Gupta said in his letter. Meanwhile, the leader of opposition in Delhi Assembly, Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, said that Delhi government should also amend the provisions of Graded Response Action Plan so that the trading class could get relief. “Delhi government’s own rules do not only allow the weekend curfew and odd-even system to be removed in Delhi. It was only to deceive the traders, shopkeepers, employees, and labourers, Delhi government sent a proposal to the lieutenant governor to remove the weekend curfew and odd-even. Delhi government should first change the rules given in the GRAP,” Bidhuri said. However, a Delhi government official said that GRAP had been made by DDMA, which is headed by LG and not by Delhi government.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/change-grap-to-ease-covid-restrictions-bjp/articleshow/89066128.cms||---

Tanavade said that the ex-CM had always worked with the interest of the party in mind, and that BJP is working within the framework of his values. Tanavade was reacting to Utpal’s resignation from BJP to contest from his father’s seat of Panaji as an independent at the upcoming February 14 polls. Utpal had said that his main objection was to Monserrate getting the BJP ticket from Panaji despite having several criminal cases pending against him. “I do not want to comment on what Utpal has to say. Our respect is for Manohar Parrikar,” said Tanavade, when asked about Utpal’s statement that he is willing to withdraw from the race for Panaji as an independent if the party gives a ticket to a ‘clean’ candidate. “If we have learnt anything in the party about ethics and compromises, it is from Manohar Parrikar,” said Tanavade. “If you recollect, when Manohar Parrikar became the CM in 2002, Monserrate was part of his cabinet. Later, in 2017, when again the government under Parrikar was formed, Monserrate was made the PDA chairman.” Tanavade said that Parrikar always knew “the importance of ethics and compromises in politics”. “Even though he never compromised on principles, possibly many decisions were also not as per his wishes. Yet, he always made compromises when the interest of the party was involved. He did what was best for the party, even if it meant he had to take a step back at times,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/goa/news/parrikar-made-monserrate-minister-tanavade-to-utpal/articleshow/89083636.cms||---

However, the number of active cases shot up to 20,701 on the day, from 18,236 on Friday. The district also logged a Covid death on Saturday. The district administration is, meanwhile, making efforts to ramp up the health infrastructure to accommodate more infected people. At least 200 beds, including 28 oxygen-equipped ones, were added to the ESI Hospital. Electricity minister V Senthil Balaji has also inaugurated an oxygen generator with a capacity of 1,000 litres per minute at the ESI Hospital. He said among the infected, 1,388 were undergoing treatment in various hospitals. “As a precautionary measure, more beds are being added to the Covid wards in hospitals. The district administration and the ESI hospital have made arrangements for the additional beds in 72 hours.” The minister said there might be more curbs, if people were found to violate the Covid norms. Collector G S Sameeran said the number of people requiring hospitalization was fewer in the district as of now. “There are 16,528 beds for Covid patients in private as well as government hospitals in district. Only 13% of them are occupied now. The infected are recovering fast. But we are putting in place required beds and other infrastructure.” He said there were 166 micro containment zones in the district, where fever camps were being conducted to identify the infected earlier and provide treatment. Sameeran said everyone should take the vaccine to mitigate the severity of virus infection. “Vaccination camps are being held in 750 places across the district, while round-the-clock vaccination is being done at the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital and the ESI Hospital.” The collector said it was a must to wear face mask and maintain social distancing to arrest the virus spread. In neighbouring Tirupur, fresh Covid cases zoomed past the 1,000-mark to 1,014 on Saturday. With this, the number of actives cases there has increased to 5,330. Tirupur also reported a Covid fatality on the day.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/3886-test-positive-for-virus-in-district/articleshow/89067034.cms||---

One of them, Lokesh Khatik, 53, who has been running a small tea stall at Khurgan road for the past three decades, told TOI that he had indeed left Kairana after his son started consuming drugs and racked up large bills running into lakhs. He said that he feared for his son's life and therefore moved to Panipat in 2013. He added that he returned in 2018. "But I feel anguished when I see the people who forced my son to consume drugs roam freely. Nothing has happened to them,” he said. Varun Singhal's family was also one of the few who the home minister met. Varun's elder brother Vinod Singhal was allegedly shot dead by extortionists in August 2014 while the latter was sitting outside a grocery store. Varun said he migrated from the city soon after his brother’s alleged murder but "came back in 2015", two years before the Yogi-led BJP state government took charge. “Almost all top politicians visited our home after my brother's murder. Everyone told me that my sister-in-law, who is a single parent to three children, will get financial help. Even Yogi ji came to my house during his visit to Kairana and assured us of financial help. However, nothing has happened so far,” Varun claimed. Shah then met the family of Rajkumar Singhal, who owns an electrical shop in Kairana. Rajkumar told TOI that he never migrated but was "only planning" to do so. “In 2013, I was attacked with swords by unidentified miscreants. I was hurt but managed to escape. In 2016, some miscreants came to my shop and asked for money. This is when I decided to shift from Kairana. I even bought a house in Shamli but before I could move the BJP government came to power and everyone told me I should stay back. So I did,” the 64-year-old said. One of the families whose picture with Shah is making rounds on social media is that of Rakesh Garg, the owner of the 'Sadu Sweets' shop. Garg migrated from Kairana after someone tried to extort Rs 20 lakh from him in 2014. He said he returned after 2017 "once the situation changed." In June 2016, BJP MP from Kairana Hukum Singh alleged that around 250 Hindu families had migrated from the town, leaving behind their properties, out of the "fear of criminals who enjoyed political patronage." The issue became a major controversy after BJP accused the ruling Samajwadi Party of pursuing "minority appeasement" policies.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/shah-meets-kairana-families-that-migrated-and-some-that-didnt/articleshow/89067035.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Coimbatore||Elusive leopard caught, released into the wild||COIMBATORE: The elusive leopard, suspected to have killed dogs in and around Sugunapuram area for a month, was trapped in the wee hours of Saturday, after sustained efforts by forest department officials for five days. The male leopard, holed up in an abandoned warehouse at B K Pudur near Kuniyamuthur, walked into the trap set for it early Saturday. Forest officials took the animal to Varagaliyar and released it into the jungle later in the day. After giving nightmares to residents in and around Sugunapuram, the leopard had entered the warehouse along Palakkad Road on January 17. After people who spotted the leopard informed them, forest officials placed cages near the entrance and exit of the warehouse. Every day, scores of people would gather near the warehouse, hoping to get a glimpse of the big cat. Initially, meat, chicken and water were placed inside the cages to lure the animal. Later, the officials used dogs as bait to draw it to the cages. However, the leopard managed to remain elusive. Though it stepped into the cage twice, it was only for a brief moment and before the cage could be shut, it walked out. Conservator of forests S Ramasubramanian said that since the leopard had no food for the past five days, veterinarians led by forest veterinary officer A Sukumar observed the animal. Though it looked exhausted, there were no injuries. It was given meat before being taken to Varagaliyar, where it was released into the forest. More than 50 forest department staff, besides those from the fire and rescue services department, were involved in the exercise.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/elusive-leopard-caught-released-into-the-wild/articleshow/89067036.cms||---

Taking a jibe at the opposition parties, Yogi said, “We have told them that now, even Kashmir is becoming a heaven in India and west UP is developing like never before. An ATS commando training centre is also coming up in Deoband.” Attacking Samajwadi Party (SP) candidates at the event, Yogi said, "Those fielded by SP are goons. Criminals have been shown the doors of jail since BJP came to power in the state. Now, they are either in jail or have left the state." He also took potshots at the opposition for announcing freebies to lure voters. “When there is no electricity, what bill are they going to waive off and from where they will give you free units? Everyone knows the condition of electricity supply in the state before 2017,” Yogi added. The CM said that when the BJP government came to power, "we first decided to stop slaughterhouses, effectively implement an anti-Romeo squad for the safety of sisters and daughters and waive off Rs 36,000 crore loans of the farmers". The CM also went on a door-to-door campaign in the town. He distributed leaflets to voters and urged them to come out and vote on February 10, the day of the first phase of the polls.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/they-wanted-to-create-kashmir-in-kairana-says-up-cm-yogi/articleshow/89067038.cms||Ishita Mishra

The test positivity rate, too, dropped to 12.88%.Experts said if the trend of the past three days is any indication, the state has already hit the peak and plateau of infections in the present wave. On Wednesday, the state reported 11,607 fresh infections, the highest in a single day so far. Over the next three days, it saw 10,368, 9,833 and 8,845 cases, respectively, registering a dip of around 1,000 infections each day. “It is a good sign that the daily virus load is gradually reducing. There are reports of people skipping tests despite developing symptoms. The government has set up testing facilities everywhere to screen people. Moreover, people should also watch out for complications, if any, even after recovering from Covid,” Ajay Parida, director, Institute of Life Sciences, said. Significantly, the once hotbed of infections, Ganjam, reported cases in double digits, along with the western districts of Boudh and Deogarh. Kendrapada and Malkangiri also saw double-digit cases. Khurda and Sundargarh continue to be the worst-hit in terms of the daily infection load. While the state’s total Covid count is set to cross the 12-lakh mark on Sunday, the recoveries will go past 11 lakh. With six more Covid fatalities being confirmed by the government, the death toll has touched 8,514. Niranjan Mishra, director of public health said, “We have reasons to predict a further decline, but we are treading cautiously.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/fresh-dip-in-covid-19-cases-in-odisha-springs-plateau-hope/articleshow/89067039.cms||---
---||Meerut||In Muzaffarnagar, ‘Muslim-shy’ SP-RLD ‘unnerves’ community||Muzaffarnagar: Muzaffarnagar has six assembly segments and the SP-RLD alliance has not fielded a single Muslim candidate this time. On the ground, this has "unnerved" local minority leaders considerably and may hurt the alliance candidates' prospects in some seats, say analysts. The pattern rivals that of the BJP, which has also fielded only Hindu candidates in the region. Congress, on the other hand, has fielded two Muslims and BSP three.Leaders of the SP-RLD combine fear that fielding candidates from the minority community could lead to a division of votes, directly benefiting BJP. But, it could also be counterproductive and lead to a drift of Muslim voters. As per official estimates, Muzaffarnagar has a population of about 25 lakh with roughly 42% Muslims. BJP emerged victorious in all seats back in 2017 after fielding only Hindu candidates. BSP had fielded three Muslims then and SP one. In this election, both Congress and BSP have fielded Muslim candidates from Charthawal and Meerapur seats. In Budhana, too, BSP has given a ticket to a minority candidate. Other parties like Chandrashekhar's Azad Samaj Party and Hyderabad-based AIMIM have fielded Muslim candidates as well.Mursaleen Rana, ex-BSP MLA, who had joined RLD recently and wanted to contest from Charthawal, said, "The RLD wanted to give tickets to Muslims in Muzaffarnagar, but SP was not keen. The alliance by not giving ticket to any Muslim candidate may suffer defeat in at least three segments in Muzaffarnagar. BSP candidates may get more Muslim votes." SP member Haji Liyakat, who had fought the 2017 polls from Meerapur and lost by only 193 votes, said, "There is some heartburn here. Muslims should have been given tickets. But, at the end of the day, we accept the party high command's decision."Local politician and former councillor Faisal Saifi said, "The decision not to give a ticket to any Muslim has forced the community to think hard about their own Muslim leadership. Minority candidates fielded by BSP, Congress and AIMIM will be the first choice. This may make things easier for the BJP." Echoing similar sentiments, Naushad Ahmed, a local shopkeeper, said, "In 2017, SP had given one and RLD two tickets to Muslim candidates, but this time both Akhilesh Yadav and Jayant Chaudhary were probably a bit Muslim-shy and preferred other options."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/in-muzaffarnagar-muslim-shy-sp-rld-unnerves-community/articleshow/89067040.cms||Aman Sharma

Another feather in the cap of these students, like Kajal Rani Goud of B Padmanavpur under Digapahandi block in Ganjam district, is that they have got jobs before the declaration of the result of the All India Trade Test (AITT) held on January 18. The test is conducted by the Directorate General of Training under the aegis of the National Council for Vocational Training, for students who have completed a two-year course at the ITIs. “I am very much happy as I got the job just three days after appearing for the test,” said Kajal. “It is the first time such a large number of girl students from the ITI got jobs in a private company at the same time,” said Rajat Kumar Panigrahy, principal, ITI Berhampur. He said these girls had been selected by the company in the campus recruitment week conducted by the ITI last month, where as many as 1,403 students got jobs. In 2017, as many as 32 girl students had got jobs in a Pune-based automobile company after being selected during campus recruitment. “I was very much worried over my future after completing the two-year ITI course. But I was lucky to get a job as soon as the test was completed,” said Padmita Raita of Bursungi in Gajapati district. “Each of the girls will get over Rs 12,000 monthly salary along with free accommodation and food,” the principal said. “They might switch to other companies with bigger salaries after getting experience,” he added. “One of our staff accompanied the girls in a train to Guntur in Telangana.

Instead of reserving it for the Scheduled Tribe, the post was reserved for a Scheduled Caste candidate,” said a villager.The election officer has lodged an FIR at the Jarada police station in this regard. “We have registered a case and are investigating the matter,” said Bhabanand Pradhan, inspector-in-charge, Jarada police station.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/villagers-snatch-nominees-papers/articleshow/89067044.cms||---

Official sources in the state election commission (SEC) said as many as 34,613 nominations have been filed for the sarpanch post of 6,793 gram panchayats while 28,153 are in fray for 6,793 samiti members’ posts. In zilla parishad election, which is being fought on party lines, the rebel candidates have entered the fray as independents. While as many as 853 zilla parishad zones will go to polls, total 3,999 candidates have filed their papers. Sources said senior leaders including observers, local MLAs and other leaders are trying hard to persuade the rebel candidates to withdraw their papers. Withdrawal of nomination will continue till Tuesday following which the final list of candidates will be announced by the poll panel. BJD Rajya Sabha member Subash Singh said the party has selected candidates for various posts in a transparent manner and there was absolutely no issue in most of the zilla parishad zones. “We made a list of two to three candidates by taking views of workers at the grass-roots level and placed it before the party president, who made the final decision regarding candidate selection. If there is any discord regarding candidates, we will try to build consensus for better results. The results of panchayat polls will be historic this time,” Singh said. BJP leader Prithiviraj Harichandan said the party leadership is trying hard to resolve problems if there is any issue regarding candidature. “We are confident that we will succeed in managing the rebel candidates before the nomination withdrawal process ends. The entire BJP cadre will fight the poll unitedly. If there is any factionalism among BJD workers, we will take its benefit,” said Harichandan. Congress veteran Suresh Routray said the number of rebel candidate is less in his party compared to BJD and BJP. “Since people are fed up with the BJD-led state government and BJP-led Union government, we are confident that people will vote Congress to power this time,” said Routray. Meanwhile, most of the candidates have also started door-to-door campaign to push for their candidature.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/nomination-over-leaders-try-to-placate-rebel-candidates/articleshow/89067050.cms||---

Gadanayak, a native of Odisha’s Dhenkanal district, and the director of National Gallery of Modern Art, New Delhi, said he is very delighted as Prime Minister Narendra Modi assigned the task to him. “I am very delighted that the Prime Minister has assigned the task to me. It seems like after so many years, Netaji will get the long-awaited and rightful honour he deserves. I am so proud that I belong to Odisha where Netaji was born and spent his childhood,” said Gadanayak. “The tall statue will be carved in jet black granite stone to be brought from Telangana. Black granite is the obvious choice for the statue as I feel granite is one of the oldest family members of the planet and the stone witnessed everything that had happened in the past. It is a difficult medium and a time-taking process but we would try to complete it within the deadline,” added the noted sculptor. “Like the black shade, Netaji also believed in taking everyone along. His strong personality will be reflected in the statue,” Gadanayak said. A team of artists will start working on the project at the earliest, using both traditional and modern technologies. Gadanayak, an alumnus of B K College of Arts and Crafts, Bhubaneswar, pursued his postgraduation at Slade School of Fine Arts in London in 1995. He won the National Lalit Kala Akademi Award in 1993, Odisha Lalit Kala Akademi Award in 1999 and the Scottish International Sculpture Award in 1996. Gadanayak's most famous projects include a black marble replica of Mahatma Gandhi’s Salt March, the sculpture of the Father of the Nation at Rajghat, the depiction of the Gandhi household, Hriday Kunj, Sabarmati Ashram, and for his installations in London.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/odisha-sculptor-to-make-india-gate-netaji-statue/articleshow/89067052.cms||Minati Singha

The institute stated in a letter that some of the defunct extension activities of ATMA Cafeteria have been discontinued and component D2 (setting up of community radio station) is cited as one of such defunct activities. In view of this, new proposals should not be forwarded to IMAGE, read the letter issued recently. ATMA is a registered society responsible for technology dissemination at the district level. The entire gamut of extension related activities including exposure trips, demonstrations, study tours and exhibitions was broadly termed as ATMA Cafeteria.However, the ministry of agriculture and farmer welfare in its January 18 letter did not mention the setting up of community radio stations as one of such defunct activities. The ministry of finance has curtailed the outlay of submission on agriculture extension (SMAE) for the period 2021-22 to 2025-26. Accordingly, the number of extension activities and manpower has been rationalised. Defunct extension activities of the existing ATMA Cafeteria have been discontinued and deployment of manpower has been restricted, read the ministry’s letter. Farmers’ bodies and community radio associations expressed concern about this decision. NA Shah Ansari, founder of Odisha’s first community radio, Radio Namaskar, and former national president of Community Radio Association of India, said, “The nascent community radio movement in Odisha will become the community media hub of South Asia due to active and effective community radios in the state. But IMAGE is trying to stop support to community radios in Odisha and it is unfortunate,” said Ansari.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/fresh-proposal-bar-on-community-radio-stns-in-state/articleshow/89067053.cms||Hemanta Pradhan

Protestors said every day hundreds of devotees are returning disappointed from the temple gate. When the government has allowed malls, marketplaces to operate and elections to go ahead amid Covid-19, then why should Jagannath Temple not be opened for the public, they asked.“At a time when the government is conducting polls, those who are coming to catch a glimpse of Lord Jagannath are being deprived of his darshan,” said Priyadarshi Pattanayak, convenor of Jagannath Sena, a socio-cultural organisation.Members of the organisation demanded that the 12th century temple be reopened as soon as possible so that devotees get to see the deities. “The decision to close the temple should be taken by the managing committee. But this time it was not done so. When the chief secretary is asking people not to fear Covid, what is the rationale for keeping visitors away from the temple,” Pattanayak asked. The temple administration shut the temple for devotees on January 8 in the wake of rising Covid cases.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/reopen-call-for-jagannath-temple/articleshow/89067055.cms||---

---||Delhi||AAP: BJP playing politics over curbs||New Delhi: Unhappy with the rejection of Delhi government’s proposal to lift the Covid-induced restrictions on opening of shops in the city’s markets, Aam Aadmi Party on Saturday accused BJP of “remote controlling” lieutenant governor Anil Baijal and making traders suffer. AAP chief spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj accused BJP functionaries of changing their views on restrictions to suit their political narrative. “When Omicron (variant) had arrived in Delhi, BJP itself was slandering the Delhi government and asking it to shut shops by making pictures of crowded markets viral (on social media). Despite making the demand themselves, BJP supporters went on to accuse the government of harming businesses after the odd-even curbs were ordered. When the government logically reasoned to reduce the curbs after the cases came down, the LG refused to do so at the behest of BJP,” he alleged. “BJP should tell when it is going to stage a dharna outside the LG house now that he has refused to lift the weekend curfew,” the AAP spokesperson further asked. Bharadwaj said that to fight the coronavirus, the governments in all countries were working with full cooperation, but BJP has been finding avenues to politicise the situation.  BJP, however, said that it was also disappointed that the LG did not lift the curbs on the city’s markets. “Our leaders have been urging authorities to withdraw weekend curfew or at least withdraw odd-even rule in markets now that the Covid wave has subsided. AAP cannot mislead the traders on that issue,” BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/aap-bjp-playing-politics-over-curbs/articleshow/89066135.cms||---

The Punjab government will be the first customer of electric scooters and give it to the state’s college-going girls at an interest-free, cheap cost, he added. His Punjab Model will be a part of the Congress manifesto, he said. “Bicycle and battery industries already exist in Ludhiana, so why can’t electric vehicles be formed. I had also tweeted (to invite Elon Musk, Tesla owner to Punjab) and create the biggest EV industry in Ludhiana,” said Sidhu, while adding that the’‘Youth, Skilling and Entrepreneurship” programme will be launched under his Punjab Model. “The Punjab Model is not a mere election model, but a well-researched tailor-made solution-model based on geographical, social and economic factors created for the people of Punjab,” he said. Promising industrial clusters and food processing units, Sidhu said a cluster based development model is the necessity. “Mohali is the centre of technological advancement and future of Punjab. Our youth are going to Bangalore and Hyderabad for better business opportunities... we don’t provide them with such opportunities,” he said. He said Punjab held export potential in wheat and rice produce and its derivatives. “Food Park and Agro Centre will be focussed on these two crops to capitalise it for the people of Punjab,” he said, adding that many attempts have been made to create clusters earlier also but an enabling environment is required. A home-based entrepreneurship policy will be brought for every home who wants to initiate any kind of business from their home, he said. Anyone can get collateral and interest free loans up to ₹2 lakh to open a home-based enterprise like e-commerce, cloud kitchen, marketing, virtual assistance, designing, tutoring, art and craft. Sidhu said 23 world class skilling centres will be opened on the basis of the above mentioned clusters, in partnership with local industry.
