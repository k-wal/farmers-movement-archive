CyberBallet by Berlin-based theatre collective, CyberRäuber, is a virtual reality (VR) interactive installation, which takes viewers on an immersive journey of movement and dance from the point of view of artificial intelligence. Held in 25-minute sessions, each with four participants, this stand-alone VR experience was conceptualised and produced by Marcel Karnapke and Björn Lengers in collaboration with Karlsruhe-based dance company, Badisches Staatsballett. CyberBallet explores what it means to be human, to be able to have a body and move around in a physical space. “The idea for this production was conceived in 2019. When the ballet company approached us for a collaboration, we were already in the process of thinking about AI and what it might mean in the field of art, especially the performing arts. So, we made an attempt to connect the two fields and explored the question of how a machine perceives movement,” says Lengers. To put the piece together, Karnapke and Lengers captured the movements of professional dancers, processed the data through machine-learning algorithms, and transferred them onto an interactive 3D stage. As a viewer, one is free to merely watch or perform along. Talking of the process of putting this together, Lengers says, “We wanted to capture what the dancers are doing. At first, we recorded the traditional two-dimensional video and then used 360-degree and 180-degree 3D cameras to record the movements of the dance ensemble in a prepared space. We also used a motion capture suit, which has over 19 little sensors that can be attached to the limbs.” Choreographed by German-Brazilian choreographer Ronni Maciel, the production features elevating music by Israeli composer Micha Kaplan. Immersed in spaceAt the show, each participant gets a designated 5mx5m space in the hall where the installation is set up. As it begins, the viewer — equipped with VR headsets and headphones — is transported to outer space, surrounded by infinite space and stars. While one can see several dancers moving their bodies to the music, there are two enormous video walls facing each other, where a multitude of picture stories are running simultaneously. “Of course, one cannot see everything,” says Lengers, adding that what is most interesting is to watch how people interact. “Every reaction is special. Many moved and danced along with the choreography, while some focused on what was going on on the picture wall, ignoring the dancers. Any kind of reaction is okay. We do not want to force anyone to do anything. It is interesting to see how people interpret stuff, what they see and what they don’t,” he shares, adding that while CyberBallet was their foray into experimenting VR with dance, the team is already producing their next dance piece.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/dance-meets-ai-at-this-virtual-reality-installation/articleshow/89201377.cms||Fathima Ashraf

The department believes that the cash was brought for distribution among voters. The department conducted the search action in Margao based on specific inputs from Goa’s IGP. An income tax official said that they received information that the cash was in possession of a hawala operator at his residence at Margao. Accordingly, a warrant was executed by the department, and a search was conducted as per provisions of the Income Tax Act. During the course of the search, it was found that the hawala operator had made a hidden cavity at his residence for storing cash and other valuables. The cash was found in this cavity. The official said that cash was also found in a secret compartment in a car parked at his residence, which was made specifically for transporting cash and other valuables. “The search and seizure operation led to the seizure of cash of over Rs 6 crore. On being questioned by the department, the hawala operator stated that the cash is hawala money. He does hawala for hardware traders of Goa,” the Income tax officer said. However, various inconsistencies have been observed in the statement of the hawala operator and it is believed that the cash was meant to be distributed among voters to influence them ahead of the legislative assembly election, the official said. In this regard, further investigations are in progress. The income tax official said that during elections, it is learnt that the distribution of cash to voters is done in order to influence them, thus adversely affecting the objectives of a free and fair election. “Seizure of unaccounted cash will reduce the possibility of its utilisation for electoral purposes and will aid the objective of a free, fair and transparent election in the state of Goa,” the Income tax official said. The department has stepped up its monitoring and is closely watching cash movement.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/income-tax-seizes-over-rs-6cr-from-margao-hawala-operator/articleshow/89210505.cms||Murari Shetye

In a letter addressed to the public relations wing of the railway ministry, the power sector major has flagged that the PSU has been “inadvertently” caught in the crossfire amid protests and reports of the ongoing controversies over the recruitment exam by the railways. “This, you would agree, is also hurting our reputation. You are requested to clarify and use the full form of the railway recruitment scheme in your press release/ statement so that this misconception is not carried on creating wrong impression amongst the users of social media and public at large,” it said. The PSU said the media has been using the abbreviated form NTPC, which gives the impression that the exams are linked to India’s largest power producer.

---||India||Ahead of Parliament session, fresh political row over Pegasus spyware||NEW DELHI: The controversy over the alleged use of Pegasus spyware for targeting the government's political opponents has returned just ahead of the budget session, with the opposition latching onto the claim of a US newspaper that acquisition of the espionage tool was part of a $2-billion deal signed with Israel in 2017. The opposition cited a report in the New York Times, which said that the powerful tool, developed by NSO Group, used to snoop by penetrating mobile phones, was part of a “package of sophisticated weapons and intelligence gear worth roughly $2 billion with Pegasus and a missile system as the centrepieces” agreed upon during PM Narendra Modi’s visit to Israel in 2017. The government refused to comment on the charge. However, sources sought to play down the matter saying it is pending with the Supreme Court, which has already ordered a probe. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi immediately seized upon the report to accuse the Modi government of treason. "Modi government bought Pegasus to spy on our primary democratic institutions... politicians, public and government functionaries, opposition leaders, armed forces, judiciary all were targeted by these phone-tappings. This is treason," he said. Coming on the eve of the budget session, the claim in the US daily may see a renewed confrontation in Parliament on the issue. In fact, leader of the opposition in the Rajya Sabha, Congress's Mallikarjun Kharge, indicated as much, saying the government had stonewalled the demand for a probe into the allegations of illegal use of the Israeli surveillance tool to target opposition leaders. NSO, the Israeli company which has developed Pegasus software, has maintained that it is sold to government agencies and not to private entities. The government, however, did not seem flustered. While it refrained from formally responding to the charge, sources pointed out that an SC-constituted committee is already probing the charges and has issued public notices seeking response from all concerned. "People should cooperate with the panel and wait for the court's response to the findings," a source said on condition of anonymity. The restraint tracked the stand the government took last year in the Supreme Court where it steered clear of confirming or denying whether it has procured spyware from Israel or any other source. In August, solicitor general Tushar Mehta explained to the court in detail the reason for its reluctance to make acquisition of Pegasus and other tools an issue of public debate. Saying that the government uses varied software to intercept communication to track terrorist activities and conspiracies by forces hostile to the country, Mehta said on August 17: "The nature of the software cannot be divulged as it would prove detrimental to national security." The NYT report, which pointed to several countries from Mexico to Poland, Hungary and UAE as well as the FBI buying the cyber tool, suggested that the stronger ties between the two countries since Modi came to power, along with the “package”, led to India voting with Israel at the UN’s Economic and Social Council to block grant of observer status to a Palestinian human rights organisation. The SG had told the apex court in August: “For national security purposes and combating terrorism, various softwares are used. The petitioners want the government to divulge which software is used and which is not used. The moment this information is divulged, terror networks may take pre-emptive or corrective steps." Refusing to put the relevant details in an affidavit, Mehta had said that the government has nothing to hide and would share everything with the committee. "This cannot be a subject matter of affidavits and public debate," he had categorically stated. According to media reports, Rahul, along with poll strategist Prashant Kishor and former election commissioner Ashok Lavasa, were among those whose phones were potentially targeted using Pegasus, but it could not be proven conclusively. The reported "targets" included IT and communication minister Ashwini Vaishaw, though he was not a member of the government at the time. At a press conference, Kharge said when the Centre stonewalled a debate on Pegasus in Parliament, leading to the washout of the last monsoon session, it was clear that the BJP government had something to hide. “They spoke a lie in Parliament,” Kharge said, while challenging the government to file a defamation case against the New York Times if its revelations were incorrect.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ahead-of-parliament-session-fresh-political-row-over-pegasus-spyware/articleshow/89211099.cms||---

If these criminals become MLAs, MPs, they will produce guns and not flowers. The only way to treat them is by using a bulldozer.” After listing his government’s welfare schemes and “achievements related to law and order”, Yogi said, “SP ki topi paap ke daag se rangi hui hai (The red cap of SP workers is tainted by the sins they have committed). During their time, riots used to happen every three days. Now, there has not been a single riot in the past five years.” BJP leaders have been going all-out to corner the SP on law and order and the Muzaffarnagar riots. Yogi had earlier attacked SP chief Akhilesh Yadav after he fielded jailed MLA Nahid Hasan from Kairana. “They call themselves socialists, but the truth is tamanchawaad (those promoting criminals and firearms) is running in their veins,” he had said. Akhilesh countered the BJP’s tirade by labeling Yogi as the “first CM with so many criminal cases”. Speaking in Meerut on Friday evening, he said, “The truth is crime has actually risen under BJP rule. Murders now take place even inside jails. They call us ‘tamanchawadi’, but let me ask you who can be a ‘tamanchawadi’, someone with so many cases registered against him or the one with no case?

Officers said Kulgam police station head constable Ali Mohammad Ganie was grievously wounded in the shooting near his home at Hasanpora Tabala of Bijbehara. He was taken to the government hospital in Anantnag town, but couldn’t be saved. It was a shoot-and-scoot, a common tactic used by terrorists. Police said the shootout at Naira village in Pulwama could continue for some time, with a joint team of police, Army and CRPF personnel engaging terrorists hiding there. The area has been cordoned off to minimise collateral damage and to prevent any terrorist from escaping. In central Kashmir's Ganderbal district, police arrested three members of The Resistance Front (TRF), an outfit backed by the Laskhar-e-Taiba. They were captured at a checkpoint manned by personnel from police, 24 Rashtriya Rifles and CRPF 115Bn. The three are identified as Faisal Manzoor of Braripora and Azhar Yaqoob of Zaipora, both in Shopian district, and Nasir Ahmad Dar of Begam in Kulgam. Two Chinese pistols, three magazines, 15 rounds of ammunition and two hand grenades were found on them. Their mobile phones were also confiscated. According to police, the three men said during questioning that they are associated with the banned TRF. An FIR was registered at Ganderbal police station.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ultras-kill-head-constable-near-his-home-in-kashmir/articleshow/89211160.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||India||2 years of Covid: Why some states show higher numbers||NEW DELHI: It’s been two years since the first Covid-19 case was recorded in India. Through this period — and three waves of the pandemic — Maharashtra and most of the southern states have consistently recorded more cases and deaths than other states of the country, particularly those in the north. While the higher numbers over two years may give the impression that these states have been the worst hit by Covid, their better reporting systems are likely to have actually saved more lives, a leading expert said. Maharashtra, where 9.3% of India’s population resides, has so far accounted for 18.8% of cases reported in the country and 28.9% of all Covid deaths. Kerala, with just 2.8% of India’s population, has reported 14.3% of all cases and 10.6% of deaths. In stark contrast, the country’s most populous state of Uttar Pradesh, home to 16.5% of Indians, has recorded just 4.9% of all cases and 4.7% of deaths. Likewise, barely 2% of Covid cases in India and 2.5% of fatalities so far have been logged in Bihar, which accounts for 8.6% of the country’s population. “People in all parts of India are equally susceptible to the coronavirus. While there can be some differences in infection rates over short periods, such a gap over a period of two years has only one explanation — Maharashtra and the southern states are doing a far better job of detecting and reporting cases than others,” said Dr Shahid Jameel, virologist and former head of the scientific advisory group to the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortia (INSACOG). "If you don't test, and test properly, you wouldn't find cases and provide institutional care," he added. The disproportionately low detection of Covid cases and reporting of deaths aren’t restricted to UP and Bihar. The trend is spread across north and central India, with exceptions such as Delhi. For instance, Bengal (7.5% of India's population) has reported 4.9% of cases and 4.2% of Covid deaths in the country. Madhya Pradesh's numbers are more skewed. With a 6% share in population, the state has accounted for 2.3% of all cases in the country and 2.1% of all deaths. Gujarat is home to 5% of India's population but has recorded 2.8% of cases and 2.1% of all deaths. Similarly, Rajasthan (5.7% of population) accounts for 2.9% of cases and 1.9% of deaths. Delhi, with a predominantly urban population, is an exception to this trend. Accounting for 1.4% of the country's population, the capital has reported 4.5% of cases and 5.2% of Covid deaths in India. Punjab's case is interesting. The state, with 2.3% of India’s population, has a higher proportion of deaths (3.5%) while infections detected are low (2.3%). While fewer cases and deaths look good on paper, are states paying a price for low detections? “Yes”, says Dr Jameel. “Consistently recording a low number of cases is not a batch of good governance. The better reporting systems in Maharashtra and the south have prevented deaths through early detections. In many northern states, a much higher proportion of Covid deaths have likely gone unreported.” Watch Two years since India's first Covid case, a long battle continues||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/2-years-of-covid-why-some-states-show-higher-numbers/articleshow/89211209.cms||Amit Bhattacharya

Stepping up the ante, with BJP intensifying its outreach to the Jat community in western UP, the former CM said it wasn’t UP but Gujarat that goes to polls later this year, which will throw up the “real surprise”. BJP has won the last six assembly elections in Gujarat. “Every section in UP has accepted that an SP-RLD coalition government is going to be formed in the state,” Akhilesh said. With UP CM Yogi Adityanath repeatedly raking up tickets to candidates with criminal backgrounds in the SP-RLD list, Akhilesh countered by saying there were 82 BJP candidates who have cases against them. There will be no riots and no one is above the law, said the former CM, who has also been targeted by BJP for the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots. Flanked by eight candidates of Gautam Budh Nagar and Ghaziabad, the two leaders said the “arrogant” BJP was forced to bow before the farmers’ year-long agitation against the Centre’s three farm laws. With a bundle of grains in their hands, the two leaders took an “anna sankalp” (pledge) to defeat BJP in the elections and raised slogans of “Bhaichara Zindabad’ (long live brotherhood). They also announced the launch of Samajwadi Thali for Rs 10 and subsidised general stores for the poor.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/up-foregone-conclusion-real-surprise-in-gujarat-akhilesh-yadav/articleshow/89211308.cms||Aditya Dev

In the 2017 assembly elections, Mamta had defeated Subodh, who was then contesting on a BJP ticket, by a margin of over 2,500 votes. This time, Subodh is contesting on a BSP ticket. Both the candidates are vying for the legacy of Surendra Rakesh, Mamta’s husband and Subodh’s brother. Surendra was a two-time MLA from the seat and minister in the previous Congress government led by Harish Rawat. He died in 2015 following a battle with cancer. According to poll watchers, the Bhagwanpur constituency could witness an even more close fight in the forthcoming elections than last time since Mamta is facing anti-incumbency. Poll watchers say that it may be premature to discount Mamta’s chances since she enjoys support from both Hindu and Muslim voters. The former government school teacher has held the seat since 2015 when she won the bypoll that was necessitated after her husband’s death.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-mla-faces-bro-in-law-in-battle-for-hubbys-legacy/articleshow/89211433.cms||Tapan Susheel

The former government school teacher has held the seat since 2015 when she won the bypoll that was necessitated after her husband’s death.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttarakhand/news/congress-mla-faces-bro-in-law-in-battle-for-hubbys-legacy/articleshow/89211435.cms||Tapan Susheel

So quick has the entry and exit of turncoats been in Uttarakhand in the run up to this year’s polls that sometimes even party members get confused. Sans ideology, the “revolving-door politics” in the hill state has become a phenomenon in itself this election season. Due to the unprecedented ‘political migration’, say poll analysts, over 15 prominent politicians have changed sides before the assembly elections. After over 40 years in Congress, former state chief Kishore Upadhyay went to BJP and was promptly made the candidate from Tehri. In a jiffy, sitting BJP MLA from Tehri, Dhan Singh Negi, joined Congress and is now fighting Upadhyay. In 2017, Sarita Arya and Sanjiv Arya fought in Nainital, the former on a Congress ticket and the latter from BJP. In 2022, they are once again pitted against each other from the same seat but this time, they have interchanged parties. The most talked-about switch has been of Harak Rawat, who spent five years in BJP as the forest minister, was recently expelled from the party, and went back to Congress. He is now campaigning for Congress in constituencies. Poll-watchers say opportunism is rampant in Uttarakhand since it is a small state where wind-ow for electoral opportunities is limited. “Uttarakhand politicians have a once-in-five-years chance of a grab at position and power. That is why, ideology often goes for a toss,” said analyst Udit Ghildiyal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-revolving-door-politics-over-dozen-netas-switch-sides/articleshow/89211598.cms||Kautilya Singh

The attack took place while he was on his way to perform ‘parikrama’ after offering prayers at the Shani Dev temple at Kokilavan in Kosikala. Two persons were following Singh while the third one was waiting on a bike to flee, a police officer said. Agitated residents staged a protest and blocked the Agra-Delhi national highway, demanding that the accused be identified and arrested.

---||World||Italy's Mattarella drops retirement plan, stays on as president||ROME: President Sergio Mattarella had already signed a lease on a new apartment and called in the packers, making it clear he wanted to leave the Quirinale Palace the minute his seven-year mandate expired on Feb. 3.  But instead, the 80-year-old Mattarella unexpectedly agreed to stay in place on Saturday and prevent a power vacuum, with Italy's fractious parties unable to pick an alternative figure capable of winning a majority in parliament.  "I had other plans, but if needed, I am at your disposition," parliamentarians quoted the snowy-haired Mattarella as telling them after they went cap-in-hand to his official Quirinale residence to ask him to remain in office.  A former constitutional judge and one-time centrist lawmaker, Mattarella was initially elected president in 2015, becoming the first head of state from the island of Sicily.  Little known to many Italians, Mattarella had a reputation for being introverted and austere, but he quickly won over his compatriots with his quiet, unassuming manner and calm handling of repeated political crises and the COVID-19 health emergency.  On the eve of the parliamentary ballot to find his successor, polls showed that most Italians wanted him to stay.  Mattarella appeared destined for a life as a law professor, but plunged into politics after his brother Piersanti, the-then governor of Sicily, was shot by the Mafia in 1980. A photograph showed Mattarella holding him shortly before he died.  Joining the Christian Democrat party that his father had helped found, Mattarella was elected to parliament in 1983 and served, among other things, as education minister, defence minister and deputy prime minister over the next two decades.  In his inaugural speech as president in 2015, he promised to fight corruption and to help reform Italy's flailing economy, saying he saw himself as an impartial political "referee".  His refereeing skills have regularly been called on.  He has overseen the creation of four governments in seven years, including his surprise move last year to call on the former European Central Bank President Mario Draghi to put together a government of national unity.  The mild-mannered Sicilian was never afraid to stand up for his pro-European ideals, threatening to sink a proposed government in 2018 after the coalition partners put forward a eurosceptic for the post of economy minister.  The anti-establishment 5-Star Movement threatened to impeach Mattarella, but the president stood firm and the parties involved finally backed down.  In many ways he has been a highly traditional president, sticking to the old playbook of delivering speeches, laying wreaths and saluting the national flag.  Slightly hunched, he is never seen without a tie and jacket and won plaudits during the COVID crisis, refusing to queue jump when vaccines were released. Instead, he was photographed at a vaccination clinic, waiting in line with everyone else.  A widower since 2012, Mattarella has two sons and a daughter, who regularly stands by his side at major functions.  He has previously said he thought presidents should only serve a single, seven-year term and it was not immediately clear if he planned to serve a full second mandate.  His predecessor Giorgio Napolitano, the only other person to have ever been elected twice, resigned after just two years of his second mandate.  It remains to be seen whether Mattarella plans to abandon his new Rome flat, or pay the rent in the hope that he might still move there before too many months pass.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/italys-mattarella-drops-retirement-plan-stays-on-as-president/articleshow/89211626.cms||---

This follows protests from politicians, women’s rights bodies and a general outcry on social media over the bank’s circular restricting granting of joining letters to women candidates who are over three months pregnant. Swati Maliwal, chairperson, Delhi Commission for Women, taking suo moto cognizance of reports on the new guidelines, issued a notice to the chairman of State Bank of India against its December 31 circular which said that women who were over three months pregnant would be considered temporarily unfit and would not be given immediate joining before delivery. On Saturday, Sena MP Priyanka Chaturvedi wrote to Nirmala Sitharaman and SBI chairman asking for the guidelines to be withdrawn. She pointed out that the extant guidelines that were brought forward in 2009 allowed the appointment of candidates up to six months of pregnancy but have now been revised. She highlighted the broader issue of the drop in female participation in the workforce. “Such regressive and sexist guidelines will exacerbate the exclusion of women and inequality faced by them,” she said. Amid the row, the country’s largest lender said: “SBI has recently reviewed the various fitness standards for recruitment in the bank, including norms for pregnant women candidates. The revised guidelines were intended to provide clarity on various health parameters where instructions were not clear or were very old.” It added that in some sections of the media, the revision in norms in this regard has been interpreted as discriminatory against women. “SBI has always been proactive towards the care and empowerment of its women employees who now constitute around 25% of our workforce,” the public sector player said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sbi-suspends-circular-on-hiring-pregnant-women-candidates/articleshow/89211652.cms||---

But in a rare case, the Madras high court has denied such a natural right to a mother who chose to live with her ‘paramour’ and ‘harassed’ her husband who attempted to get her back to the family. “This court would wish to clarify that refusal to grant interim custody to the mother is not meant to belittle her motherhood or slighting the umbilical relationship of the mother and her minor daughters. But what stood in the way was the apparent hysterical disposition manifested in her interminable acrimonious legal pursuit in the matter,” Justice V Parthiban said. Retrieving the estranged conjugal relationship appears to be not pragmatic in the circumstances of the case. But enragement on that account for whatever reasons, need not be nurtured or harboured and carried to the future, undermining the parental bond, if she truly cares for the welfare of her minor daughters, the court added. “The petitioner (mother) can think of taking professional advice and work towards a mutually acceptable settlement, instead of playing the legal games of one-upmanship. The situation could still be reversed and salvaged. The ball is in her court and not in this court,” the judge said. However, the court permitted the mother to contact her daughters through video call during weekends.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/madras-high-court-denies-custody-of-kids-to-mom-because-of-bitter-legal-battle/articleshow/89211683.cms||Suresh Kumar

Speaking on the 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between the two countries, Modi said it was the best possible time now to set new goals in the relationship. “This day holds importance in our relationship as full diplomatic ties were established between the two countries 30 years ago. A new chapter between the two countries had begun. It was a new chapter but history between us is age-old,” said the PM. “For centuries, the Jew community has stayed in India in a harmonious environment without any discrimination and has grown. It has made an important contribution in our development journey,” he added. In a special video message on the occasion, Modi said people of India and Israel have always shared a special relationship. “There cannot be a better opportunity than now for setting new goals for mutual cooperation when India is marking 75 years of its independence, Israel will mark 75 years of its independence next year and the two countries are marking 30 years of their diplomatic ties,” Modi said. “On this important milestone of 30 years, I congratulate all. I am confident that India-Israel friendship will continue to set new records of mutual cooperation in the decades to come,” the Prime Minister said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/best-time-to-set-new-goals-for-india-israel-ties-says-pm-modi/articleshow/89211700.cms||---

The index was compiled by taking into account a variety of factors deemed important for anyone planning a road trip, including attractions like the Unesco World Heritage sites, wildlife, natural assets, range of landscapes, the number of cosmopolitan cities, as well as logistical factors including the quality of roads, gas prices and average holiday rental prices. India features at No. 10 on the list that is led by the United States, Mexico and Canada and Malaysia (in that order). What is interesting is that India is ahead of the countries France, Germany, Japan, Turkey and Spain, all of them traditional tourist magnets. The cross-country travel index has assessed countries on the basis of the attractions they are home to, their land size, the number of known vertebrate species, ranking of natural assets like beaches and parks, number of rainforests/jungles, mountains, deserts, beaches, glaciers, forests and the number of ‘Best Cities’ in the top 100 ranking. FAITH, the policy federation of all the national associations representing the complete tourism, travel and hospitality industry of India also referred the index to the tourism ministry and said the rankings should form a vital cornerstone of India’s post-Covid global repositioning and marketing campaigns. Key features that pushed India ahead of the traditionally popular tourist destinations were its 40 Unesco World Heritage sites, close to 1,900 species of animals and at least two cities, Mumbai and Delhi, which are regarded as among the top 100 metros to live in the world. The index also accounted for the quality of roads in India, the prices of fuel and also pegged the average weekly rentals for cross country travel in India at under Rs 13,000 per week.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-ranked-among-top-10-in-cross-country-travel-index/articleshow/89211719.cms||Swati Mathur

The tenure of the Grovers, along with several other employees, at the New Delhi-headquartered company is being reviewed, said sources. When contacted, a BharatPe spokesperson said, “The board of BharatPe is committed to the highest standard of corporate governance at the company… The board strongly believes in protecting interests of all stake holders, including customers, employees and partners.” In case of BharatPe, Grover first sparked controversy when a leaked audio call clip allegedly featuring him abusing and giving death threats to a Kotak employee, for failing to provide funding for the Nykaa IPO on October 28, went viral. The tech entrepreneur, a former Kotak employee himself, had dismissed it as a fake clip. But the developments soon assumed significance when a legal notice sent by the Grovers to banker Uday Kotak and to three members of the bank’s senior leadership team, surfaced.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/bharatpe-ropes-in-agency-for-independent-audit/articleshow/89211746.cms||John Sarkar

And they will definitely not have live shows or DJ nights, thanks to a verbal diktat issued by the excise department at a hurriedly held meeting with industry representatives on Saturday. Reasons: Noise pollution and rising drug abuse in the city. Noise pollution, one can understand given that some of the pubs are in residential areas. But what has the drug trade got to do with music? Many pub owners wondered if Hyderabad will become drug-free if their watering holes hit the silent mode. Shocked by the new directive, an industry executive said, “We have been warned of strict punishment — temporary shutdown of 10 days or even cancellation of license — in case the rule is violated. How can the industry survive like this? We would appreciate if the government reconsidered this move.” Telangana’s excise minister V Srinivas Goud confirmed the new unwritten rule but insisted it was being rolled primarily out to curb “noise pollution”. The minister, however, hinted that the rule helped in arresting drug abuse by “youngsters”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/to-fight-drugs-hyderabad-pubs-told-to-stop-music/articleshow/89211759.cms||Sudipta Sengupta

Sources said, the government is set to announce more number of trainsets, similar to Vande Bharat-type trains, which would be the future of railways for passenger transportation. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on August 15 had announced the rolling out of 75 indigenously-developed Vande Bharat trains in 75 weeks. Another major focus of the budget would be on the roll stocks which include 6,500 alumnium coaches, 1,240 locomotives and about 35,000 wagons in a bid to completely makeover its fleet. The proposals for bulk production of aluminum coaches, a gradual shift from steel-bodied LHB coaches to lightweight energy efficient ones, in the Railway Budget aims at meeting the twin goals of the national transporter — reduction in energy consumption and increase in loading of bauxite for aluminum plants. The proposed plan for going full steam for production of about 6,500 aluminum coaches also envisages growth in freight with more bauxite loadings as well as reduction in power consumption for the lightweight energy efficient coaches. Like trainsets (Vande Bharat type trains) in the passenger sector, the railway ministry is also proposing to introduce EMU for freight operation with wagons, which will meet the requirement of small players. Officials said there would be announcements with the aim to reduce logistics cost in railways from 14% to 11%. The proposed initiatives are likely to bring down the transport cost for cargo by 4%. Sources said the government would make some budgetary provision for promotion of new technologies.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-may-unveil-more-semi-high-speed-trains/articleshow/89211786.cms||---
---||Business||Impact of pandemic? Women jobseekers fell by 34% in 2021||MUMBAI: Not only have more women lost jobs compared to men during the pandemic, but also fewer women are returning to work. The number of women actively looking for work each month reduced by three million between 2019 and 2021, says the latest bulletin from Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) and Centre for Economic Data and Analysis (CEDA). CMIE data shows that urban India had 22.1% fewer women employed in 2021 than in 2019. However, while 9.52 million women actively searched for jobs every month in 2019, this declined to only 6.52 million in 2021. This is based on CMIE’s state-wise monthly time-series of employment that goes back to January 2019. This was in contrast with the trend in male workforce, says CMIE data. The number of male workers actively looking for jobs in 2021 was up by 19.7% in urban India and 14.9% in rural India (compared to 2019). The trend of fewer women seeking a return to work was observed in both urban and rural India. In urban India, only 2.57 million women actively searched for jobs every month in 2021 as compared to 3.87 million in 2019 (a decline of 33.7%), CMIE data showed. In rural India, only 3.95 million women actively looked for jobs in 2021 as compared to 5.16 million in 2020 and 2021 (23.5% less). A decline in male employment in a quarter saw a comparable increase in the number of men actively looking for jobs. A similar trend not was not seen among women. Four states saw over 50% decline in average monthly female employment in 2021 than in 2019. These were Tamil Nadu (50.9%), Goa (56%), J&K (61%), and Punjab (57.9%). Except Jharkhand, all eastern Indian states (West Bengal, Odisha, and Chhattisgarh) registered a significant increase in female employment in 2021 over 2020. Unlike male employment, there was also an urban-rural divide when it came to female employment in the country, the data showed. Average female employment in urban India in 2021 was 6.9% lower than 2020 and 22.1% lower than the pre-pandemic year, 2019. In rural India however, female employment in 2021 was 9.2% higher than 2020 and only 0.1% lower than 2019. Therefore, female employment suffered a significant reversal in urban India since the pandemic.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/impact-of-pandemic-women-jobseekers-fell-by-34-in-2021/articleshow/89211802.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

The experts added that the virus, which uses bat ACE2 receptors, cannot bind to human ACE2 receptors unless it acquires a significant mutation. The Chinese paper — yet to be peer-reviewed — had sparked considerable alarm, especially on social media. Read AlsoNeoCov coronavirus found in bats may pose threat to humans in future, scientists cautionBEIJING: A type of coronavirus, NeoCov, that spreads among bats in South Africa may pose a threat to humans in future if it mutates further, according to a study by Chinese researchers. The yet-to-be peer-reviewed study recently posted on the preprint repository BioRxiv, shows that NeoCov is closelyState task force member Dr Shashank Joshi told TOI that NeoCoV is in fact an old virus (first identified in 2011 in bats) that is closely related to MERS CoV that uses DPP4 receptors to enter cells. “NeoCOV can use ACE2 receptors of bats, but it cannot use human ACE2 receptors unless a new mutation occurs. Everything else that is being said about the virus is hype,” Dr Joshi said. Vinod Scaria, principal scientist at Delhi-based CSIR-IGIB said zoonotic spillover — transmission of a virus from animals to humans — is a rare occurrence. Coronavirus live updates“The virus, in natural form, does not infect humans. And since it has not infected humans yet, it has not caused any deaths. NeoCoV is also not ‘new’; the virus has been known for years. NeoCoV cannot inherently bind to human ACE2 receptors, but artificial mutations can enhance binding. However, such mutations are not naturally found in NeoCoV.” Scaria, however, said regular surveillance of human and animal viruses is key to understanding the spectrum of viruses and early warning measures about likely spillover events. Virologist Dr Shahid Jameel said, “NeoCoV has been found in a kind of bat and is the closest so far in its genetic makeup to the MERS CoV that emerged in humans in 2012 via camels. MERS doesn’t infect and transmit between humans very well and requires very close contact with the animal. NeoCoV also binds well to bat ACE2 receptor but not human ACE2 receptor. So it’s unlikely to readily infect humans. ” Dr Jameel, however, added that it is good to know there is something “out there with the potential to jump" in the future. Read AlsoStudy finds changes in Omicron's spike proteinWASHINGTON: A team of scientists has found the precise structural changes in the spike protein of the Omicron variant of Covid-19. The study has been published in the 'Science Journal'. "The findings provide a blueprint that researchers can use to design new countermeasures, whether they be vaccines “That way we can be prepared. There are an estimated 3000-plus coronaviruses in bats. The more we know about them, the more we can be prepared for future spillovers,” he said. Dr San- jay Pujari from the ICMR National Task Force on Clinical Research for Covid-19 also said NeoCoV cannot yet infect humans.  “NeoCoV is closer to MERS-COV than SARSCoV-2 and believed to be one of the ancestral strains of MERS-CoV. It is distinct from MERS-CoV because of its ability to use the ACE-2 receptor in bats but not in humans. So in its present form, it has no ability to infect humans. There is no need to panic at present. There will be strengthening of surveillance and research efforts to monitor its evolution at a global level.” Reports had also claimed NeoCoV may have a mortality rate of one in three infec- ted individuals. But a top scientist said that estimate likely came from the apparent mortality for MERS CoV, the closest (85% similar) to NeoCoV. “The WHO itself has said that the mortality number for MERS is an overestimate. As per a WHO statement on MERS, approximately 35% of patients with MERS have died, but this may be an overestimate of the true mortality rate, as mild cases of MERS may have been missed by existing surveillance systems. Until more is known about the disease, the case fatality rates are counted only among the laboratory-confirmed cases,” the scientist said, quoting the WHO.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/experts-say-no-neocov-threat-in-current-form/articleshow/89211826.cms||Neha Madaan

The Karnataka government on Saturday decided to allow schools to reopen in Bengaluru urban from Monday. “The Covid positivity rate in the state has come down from 33% last week to 20.9% as of Saturday,” revenue minister R Ashoka said. The government closed schools from January second week after cases started to surge across Karnataka. Schools across the state reopened last week, but remained closed in Bengaluru urban as its positivity rate was above 5%. Telangana has decided to reopen all educational institutions from February 1, education minister P Sabitha Indra Reddy said on Saturday. This was done after the Telangana HC asked state government on Friday to explain its plan to reopen schools, but keep colleges closed. In Pune, schools and colleges will reopen from February 1, said deputy CM Ajit Pawar on Saturday. But school hours will be halved for at least a week for classes 1-8. A similar order was issued in Uttarakhand to let schools open for classes 10-12 from Monday, but many parents weren’t happy because Covid-19 infections have not gone down in the hill state and most government teachers are occupied with assembly election duty. States like Jharkhand are contemplating reopening schools. A proposal to this effect was sent to the state disaster management authority, school education secretary Rajesh Sharma said. “We will send a fresh proposal seeking reopening of classes 1 to 12.” (Inputs from Bengaluru, Pune, Dehradun and Ranchi)||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/covid-19-karnataka-maharashtra-uttarakhand-take-steps-to-reopen-some-schools/articleshow/89211869.cms||---

However, the clear skies have also made the nights more chilly. On Saturday, the minimum temperature was two degrees below the normal mark and was recorded at 5.7 degrees Celsius, marginally down from 5.8 degree Celsius on the previous day.Despite a chilly start to the day, Saturday saw the daytime temperature rise to 20.2 degrees Celsius, a degree higher than the 19.2 degree Celsius recorded on Friday. However, it was still two degrees below the normal mark. This was the third-highest maximum temperature recorded for this month, with the highest being 21.8 degrees Celsius, logged in on January 4.According to the IMD, the minimum temperature is expected to rise by 4-6 degrees Celsius in the coming days and may touch 9 degree Celsius by Thursday. Thereafter, it is expected to fall by 3-4 degrees Celsius. The daytime temperature is likely to remain around 18-20 degrees Celsius over the next few days.“An active western disturbance and its induced cyclonic circulation is expected to impact the region from February 2. This will lead to scattered to fairly widespread rainfall activities in Haryana with a spell of light to moderate intensity, in the middle of the coming week. In the next few days, the skies will remain clear, and as a result, the daytime temperature is expected to remain between 18-20 degrees Celsius,” the IMD official said.For today, the weatherman has predicted that there will be mist in the morning and clear sky later in day with strong surface winds of 25-35 kmph. The minimum and maximum temperature is expected to hover around 6 and 18 degrees Celsius.Meanwhile, the city’s air quality deteriorated and slipped into the ‘poor’ category. The overall AQI reading was at 233, as compared to 164 on the previous day. The AQI at Vikas Sadan and Sector 51 were recorded in the ‘poor’ category with a reading of 255 and 277, respectively.

---||Gurgaon||Workers try to meet CM, stopped by cops||Gurgaon: A dozen anganwadi workers were bundled into a bus by police on Saturday after they tried to meet chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, who was on his way to the PWD rest house for a scheduled meeting. The workers, who wanted to raise their demands for increments, work benefits, regularised jobs and skill upgradation training to the CM, were later let off at another location.The workers have alleged that cops assaulted one worker some 100 metres away from the PWD rest house, after which she fell sick and started vomiting. Then they were herded to a city police station, where cops allegedly assaulted another older worker.However, the police have refuted the claims, saying they “did not assault anyone”. “We also did not detain anyone. The workers got asked to board the bus only to maintain law and order. Later, they got dropped off at a nearby location,” said police spokesperson Sube Singh.According to the protesters, they were making an effigy of Khattar in the Civil Lines area as a part of a pre-planned protest when they learned that he was on the way to the PWD rest house. Since December last month, the anganwadi workers and helpers have been protesting across the state to ensure that they get increments promised by the prime minister in 2018, as well as training for the Poshan Tracker application that the government has been pushing.Talking about the incident on Saturday, Rachna, one of the protesting workers, said, “We requested the police to let a delegation of seven workers meet the CM to put forth their grievances, but instead they started brutally assaulting us and forced us into a bus.”Another worker, Sarla, said that the protesters were shocked by the conduct of the police. “We were not going to do anything to the CM; we just wanted to meet him. How can police, including men and women cops, beat us up for that? Today showed how the CM treats workers,” she said.The protesters alleged that police herded some of them to the police station, where cops slapped a few of them. “First, I want to ask why the men police personnel were handling the women protesters. The police conduct was inappropriate and brutal. One of our older members got beat up badly, and a few others received minor injuries. But, they can not muzzle our voices,” said Saraswati, district secretary, Gurgaon Anganwadi Worker and Helper Union.The anganwadi workers said that the show of strength by the police has further strengthened their resolve to fight for their legitimate demands. The protesters have been hitting the streets for over 50 days now, ignoring the cold winter and dropping temperatures.On Friday, taking a leaf out of the farmers’ agitation, the workers had taken out tractors and trolleys in Karnal, the CM’s hometown, to give a reminder to the government about their ongoing protest.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/workers-try-to-meet-cm-stopped-by-cops/articleshow/89212363.cms||Sagrika Kissu
---||Gurgaon||Why operations at over 26k Anganwadi centres have stalled since Dec||Gurgaon: Over 50,000 Anganwadi workers and helpers have been protesting against the state government over non-payment of increments and other issues since December last year, halting the functioning of nearly 26,000 Anganwadi centres in the state. These include at least 1,100 Anganwadi centres in Gurgaon. The protests have most impacted service deliveries and early childhood nutritional care in villages, with several sarpanches claiming that children and mothers have been left unattended. “People are facing problems, and we have informed the block development office about this,” said Kherki Village sarpanch Majra Deshraj. According to the Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) department, which employs Anganwadi workers, the lack of services may start affecting several development indicators for early childhood care and the health and nutritional status of the villages.However, there is no resolution in sight. “We have convinced a few workers to re-join work in the Pataudi block, but the majority are not ready to work.The workers need to understand that they are putting the lives of newborn kids and pregnant women in danger,” ICDS district programme officer Sunaina Khatri said.The strike has also impacted the state government plan to upgrade 4,000 Anganwadi centres into play-way schools as workers are not showing up for associated training programmes. Additionally, the national campaign on malnutrition, held in January, could not reach as many blocks and people as expected.What workers wantThe protesters are seeking a Rs 1,500 hike for workers and a Rs 750 hike for helpers in monthly honorarium, announced as a Diwali gift by the prime minister in 2018. Another major reason behind the protests is the introduction of the Poshan Tracker application for workers, who say they have not received sufficient training for using it. Many workers do not even have smartphones. “Over 50% of the staff is Class 8 or Class 10 pass. We need skill up-gradation courses and smartphones, along with a monthly internet allowance to work on the Poshan app,” said Anganwadi Karyakarta Sahayika union general secretary Pushpa Dalal.What the government saysOn December 29, the state government had announced a Rs 1,000 incentive for all workers for their services during the Covid-19 first and second waves. “The department will also procure smartphones and distribute them to the workers so they can work on the Poshan app. We will be giving a monthly internet allowance and need-based training to the workers, too,” a senior government official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/why-operations-at-over-26k-anganwadi-centres-have-stalled-since-dec/articleshow/89212364.cms||Siddharth Tiwari

The victim and accused both survived and are currently under treatment. The accused has been identified as Ravi, who is a father of three children and was staying separately from his parents for the past one year. He had allegedly threatened his parents two days back when they refused to divide the property.

During a discussion about Payal’s wedding, Ravi objected to a groom selected by his parents. This led to an argument when the accused started assaulting his mother. Rest of the family members tried rescuing her. While Santosh warned to file a police complaint, Ravi picked a brick and hit her. She submitted a complaint which mentioned that Ravi was troubling them for property. Based on the complaint, a case has been registered under sections 323 (causing hurt) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code at Rajendra Park police station.

The workers were shifting a ladder made of iron when it came in contact with an overhead electricity wire.According to police, the three men were carrying some construction and repair work on the rooftop of the two-storey building with the help of the ladder. They were shifting it when it touched with an overhanging electricity wire, electrocuting them.Due to the impact of the electric shock, the workers were thrown away. Two of them, Pan (32) and Bharat (35) from UP, fell off the building and died on the spot. The third, Bhanu Kumar from Bihar, sustained critical injuries. “There was a loud sound and we saw them thrown into the air,” an eyewitness working at the site said, adding that it all happened in a few seconds.A security guard found Pan and Bharat on the ground. He alerted the contractor and informed police. The three men were taken to a nearby hospital, where doctors declared two of them dead. Police said the bodies have been taken to the mortuary. Their families have been informed and an autopsy will be carried once they arrive in Gurgaon.Pan and Bharat came to the city a few months ago and used to work at construction sites. “No case has been registered.Action will be taken after the statements of the workers’ family members are recorded,” police spokesperson Subhash Boken said.This is the second incident in the past 10 days in which workers have died at construction sites in Gurgaon. On January 20, two workers died after the walls of a trench they had been digging at a construction site in Sector 56 caved in, burying them under tonnes of soil. Their family members alleged that the contractor who had engaged them hadn’t provided adequate safety gear to any of the labourers. The plot owner and contractor were booked.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/iron-ladder-touches-wire-2-workers-die/articleshow/89212366.cms||Bagish Jha
---||Gurgaon||Screen time helped! O2 to e-comm, teenage techie has app solutions||Gurgaon: The prolonged closure of schools since March 2020 has disrupted education in an unprecedented way, but 14-year-old Tanish Sethi, a Class 10 student of a private school in Sirsa, sees it as a blessing in disguise.Increased exposure to online classes and digital learning methods during this time helped this boy become a serial app developer. And earlier this week, it earned him the Pradhan Mantri Rashtriya Bal Puraskar in the innovation category.On January 24, the Union ministry of women and child development awarded 29 students from across the country for achievements in various fields. Tanish from Dabwali in the Sirsa district got the award for developing a unique e-commerce mobile application, Pashu Mall, that connects cattle vendors with buyers.His father couldn’t have been more proud. “Being a teacher, I know how much these lockdowns have impacted the learning levels among children. However, I am proud of my son. Not only did he learn coding and mobile application designing on his own, but also developed dozens of apps during this period,” said Ajay Sethi, Tanish’s father.When the first lockdown in March 2020 shrunk classrooms into tiny screens of smartphones, Tanish, then a Class 8 student, had been spending more time on the Internet than ever before. He chanced upon a YouTube tutorial on app development, and thus started the quest to feed his curiosity. “I have been a tech junkie for long. I had learnt image editing and logo designing quite early, too. But I could not explore much because school life did not leave me with enough time. Also, I did not have a phone or a laptop then. The pandemic changed all of that. Online education increased my time with the digital world,” Tanish said.Talking about the initial push, Tanish said he often checked government websites for innovation competitions and realised that people of his age were developing applications. “I started searching for online courses on app designing. I came across a YouTube tutorial, where I got to know that I needed to learn to code first,” he said. Tanish spent the first three months of lockdown learning coding, and by June 2020, he was already feeling confident about developing an app.However, he still did not have much idea about it. “Then, I came across a saying — where there is a gap, there is a scope for an app. And the first gap I saw was the difficulty my parents and teachers were facing while juggling between online classes and offline school work. So, I developed a to-do list app called List Up on June 20, 2020,” he said.The feedback on his first app pushed him to start designing more complex apps with advanced coding skills. Since then, he has developed nine apps, he says.When the second wave hit the country and schools closed down again for months, Tanish had already aced app designing. The oxygen crisis in hospitals and his neighbourhood and the lockdown woes of the cattle traders caught his interest. “I was very moved by the oxygen crisis. I developed an Oxygen Store app and started searching online for oxygen suppliers. I would call them up to sign up on my app, but the majority of them turned me down, thinking I am just an overenthusiastic kid,” he said.His breakthrough came when he learnt about the struggles of the local farmers and cattle traders. Due to lockdown, ‘pashu mandis’ had closed down. While cattle traders could not find buyers, farmers could not rent cattle for ploughing and other needs. So, Tanish developed and launched Pashu Mall. “This time, I reached out to buyers and sellers in the local area. I also put up posters to reach out to more of them. I then circulated the app details among the protesting farmers through social media. Soon, the app had recorded over 16,000 downloads,” he said.His parents said Tanish was a self-trained app developer, and they only supported him financially. “We only paid for the classes and the fees for approvals from Google Playstore,” said Sareena Sethi, Tanish's mother.With the board exams around the corner, Tanish is not undertaking new assignments at this point. He spends most tof the ime studying and fixing bugs and providing updates to his existing apps. Tanish told TOI he aspires to crack the IIT entrance test and become a certified coder one day.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/screen-time-helped-o2-to-e-comm-teenage-techie-has-app-solutions/articleshow/89212367.cms||Siddharth Tiwari

The leopard was found to be conscious, but could not move because of the injury. It was later taken to the Rohtak zoo for treatment and officials said it should be fine in due course of time. The injured leopard was spotted on the roadside around 9am by one of the villagers in the area. It had been hit by a vehicle between Tauru and Padheni village of Nuh. In the last 14 years, 10 leopards have died in road accidents in south Haryana. After being informed by the villagers, a team of wildlife department officials from Gurgaon rushed to the spot with nets, cage and a tranquiliser gun. As the leopard was injured, it took the team just 10 minutes to put the big cat in the cage. The leopard was first taken to a treatment centre in Sultanpur National Park and then to Rohtak zoo. “The leopard wasn’t able to move as it was injured. It was conscious and our team lifted it carefully and put it in the cage. We didn’t tranquilise it. It has been referred to Rohtak zoo for treatment,” said Rajesh Chahal, wildlife inspector, Gurgaon.Asked if there is an underpass in the area for the wild animals to cross the expressway, Chahal said, “Yes, there is a wildlife underpass near the area where the incident occurred.”Meanwhile, wildlife activists said these highways had fragmented the Aravalis and bisected the corridor used by the wild animals to traverse from Asola Wildlife sanctuary in Delhi, passing through Gurgaon, to Sariska in Rajasthan.“It is high time that the Haryana government impose speed restrictions of 40-50kmph on these corridors,” said Vaishali Rana Chandra, wildlife activist.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/3-yr-old-leopard-hit-by-vehicle-on-e-way-injured/articleshow/89212369.cms||Ipsita Pati

These 12 machines, officials said, are processing only 1,200 tonne of waste a day as against the recently installed “more efficient” three trommels having a capacity to process 5,000 tonnes daily.“We plan to remove the 12 trommels from the landfill site. The new machines installed at the site are efficient. We also have space constraint at the landfill site, so we need to install more efficient machines to expedite clearing the legacy waste,” said Vaishali Sharma, MCG additional commissioner.Sources said that MCG’s waste management concessionaire Ecogreen will also shift its trommels to the material recovery facilities it’s creating. The MRF in Badshapur will soon be inaugurated, they said.The civic body has a deadline of July 2022 to clear the legacy waste from the landfill site for which it needs to expedite its work at the landfill. “Even if we manage to process 80% of waste at the landfill site by July, it would show progress and our efforts. For this, we need to step up our efforts. We can use these trommels till March 31 and a decision to replace or keep them will be taken soon,” said a senior MCG official. In order to expedite the work, the MCG had floated two tenders for waste processing, which now have been put on hold by the urban local bodies department for not taking administrative approval. Sources said that the ULB department has asked MCG officials to submit documents regarding the tenders on Monday.Officials said that around 1,800 tonnes of waste is dumped at the landfill site daily, which needs to be processed simultaneously.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/mcg-may-remove-12-old-trommels-from-bandhwari/articleshow/89212371.cms||---

CM walks into MCG office||Gurgaon: Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar visited the MCG office in Sector 39 around 9.15pm on Saturday and expressed displeasure as no official was present at the control room where the mechanical sweeping machines are kept and their movement is monitored.Khattar first enquired about the procedure MCG follows to ensure monitoring of these mechanical sweepers, which clean the city roads at night, and then asked the officials about the number of machines that are deployed each night.The CM was accompanied by deputy municipal commissioner (DMC) Vijaypal Yadav and other sanitation department officials. Since nobody was present at the control room when Khattar arrived, he asked for the person who should have been on duty then.When Yadav said he did not know, the CM called up MCG commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja. Sources said the computer operator who monitors the movement of the machines in the city was called up, but his phone was switched off.Khattar then asked senior sanitary inspector Rishi Malik to present the attendance register. Malik informed him that they maintained an attendance register of only officials who were on field duty.The CM was informed that MCG had deployed 13 sweeping machines, which covered 13 different routes between 10pm an 5am. Since Khattar had arrived early and the machines were to start operating from 10pm, many of the operators were yet to turn up, he was told. Khattar then sought to know how the sweeping machines, which are fitted with GPS devices, worked and were monitored.“The sweeping machines start at 10pm and I had reached a little early. So, I told the MCG officials to present me with the record of all the 13 routes covered by these vehicles at night. I will check the night sweeping carried out by these vehicles and will take action if any discrepancies are found,” the CM told a few reporters outside the civic body’s office.Sources said that after the CM had left, Yadav and Malik went to the PWD rest house, where the CM is staying on Saturday, along with the computer operator and showed him the entire record of the night sweeping. After his surprise visit to the MCG office, the CM also went to the GMDA office.There, the CM inspected the Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) and asked the workers how they detected stolen vehicles. The workers informed him that they monitored CCTV footage and alerted patrolling teams. “I was told that 32 stolen vehicles were traced on Saturday. I have suggested that the feature of face recognition be included to keep a check on suspects,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/whos-on-duty-cm-walks-into-mcg-office/articleshow/89212374.cms||Vishakha Chaman

In the last 24 hours, three patients succumbed due to the infection in GB Nagar while one person died in Ghaziabad, officials said. In January, GB Nagar has recorded 13 Covid-related fatalities, of which 10 were recorded since January 22. In the neighbouring district, 10 people have died due to the viral infection this month of which five were recorded in the past seven days, data obtained from district health officials showed.Former Ghaziabad MLA Suresh Bansal (80), who was admitted to Yashoda Hospital on January 13 following complaints of breathlessness, succumbed on Saturday. “Bansal had severe breathing problem as the carbon dioxide level in his body had increased. His Covid report came negative on January 26 but due to comorbidities, his condition could not stabilise. Subsequently, he was put on a ventilator but he suffered a heart attack and breathed his last around 10.30 am on Saturday,” medical superintendent Dr Anuj Agarwal told TOI.Meanwhile, the district added only 385 positive cases on the day, while GB Nagar saw 620 new infections. The two districts are at the top of the list of districts with maximum cases after Lucknow, which added 1,705 new cases on the day. The two other districts that reported a high number of cases in the last 24 hours in the state are Jhansi (388 cases, 3 deaths) and Meerut (321 cases).According to health officials, though the number of active cases in GB Nagar was 3,559, at least 967 people had recovered in the last 24 hours. In the neighbouring district, there were 2,249 active cases while 14 people were discharged from hospitals since Friday, they said. The sample positivity rate reported in Ghaziabad on Saturday remained around 5.1% even as the district performed 7,500 Covid tests in the past 24 hours. Health officials informed that during a special drive between January 24 and 29 in the district, a total of 8,977 people above 60 years were identified who had not taken even the first dose of the vaccine.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/noida-registers-620-new-cases-three-more-deaths/articleshow/89212376.cms||Abhijeet Singh

The 79-year-old was down with Covid but he had recently tested negative. However, he was on life support at the hospital due to breathing trouble and other comorbidities for the past 15 days.In an official statement, Dr Anuj Agarwal, the medical superintendent at Yashoda hospital in Kaushambi, said that Bansal was being treated in the hospital since January 13 for breathing difficulties and he died around 10.30am on Saturday.“A four-member respiratory team was treating Suresh Bansal at the hospital. He was put on a ventilator due to the increase in the amount of carbon dioxide in his body. On examination, it was found that he had also suffered a heart attack. On January 26, his Covid report came negative, but due to comorbidity, heart disease, kidney disease and serious breathing problems, he could not come out of the ventilator,” said Dr Agarwal.Bansal was given a BSP ticket to contest from the Ghaziabad seat in the 2022 assembly polls but he was replaced by KK Shukla, a former BJP leader who joined the BSP recently, due to his ill-health. Bansal served as the BSP MLA from Ghaziabad from 2012-17 after defeating BJP’s Atul Garg by a margin of over 12,000 votes. However, during the 2017 assembly election, he lost to Garg. He also contested the 2019 Lok Sabha elections from Ghaziabad as a candidate of the SP-BSP alliance but lost to BJP’s General VK Singh (retired).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ghaziabad/former-bsp-mla-from-gzb-suresh-bansal-dies-at-79/articleshow/89212378.cms||---

In his complaint, Sachin Tyagi, a resident of Noida’s Sector 82, claimed that he placed an advertisement on OLX to sell his SUV last week. The accused, identified as Nitesh Bharadwaj of Sector 168, called him up the following day and requested for a test drive. Tyagi readily agreed and asked him to come to Bhangel on January 25. As agreed, Bharadwaj reached Bhangel and the two subsequently went for the test drive. After travelling for around 5km, the accused told him he was satisfied with the SUV’s condition and fixed the deal for Rs 6 lakh,” a police official said. In Sector 110, Bharadwaj stopped the SUV on the roadside and allegedly asked Tyagi to take over the steering so that he could make an advance payment of Rs 10,000 and leave. “As Tyagi got down to come over to the driver’s side, the accused pressed the gas pedal and disappeared within moments,” he said. Tyagi, who works as a clerk at a college in Bhangel, first tried to contact Bharadwaj but his mobile number was switched off. He immediately dialled 112 and informed police about the incident. Teams were formed and a search for the suspect started, the officer said. On his complaint, an FIR was registered against an unknown person under sections 420 (cheating) and 406 (criminal breach of trust) of IPC. “We scanned multiple CCTV cameras along the route and finally managed to arrest the suspect from Gejha village in Sector 93. During interrogation, he revealed that he was jobless and hence he had committed this crime,” the officer said. The vehicle was recovered from his possession. Bharadwaj was produced before a court and sent to judicial custody.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/30-yr-old-man-flees-with-an-suv-after-test-drive-held/articleshow/89212380.cms||Advitya Bahl

The cops said they were both residents of Sangam Vihar in New Delhi. “On Saturday afternoon, the two arrived at the bridge in a Maruti Brezza.

---||Ghaziabad||‘Criminals with tickets will seek mercy after Mar 10’||Ghaziabad: Continuing his attack on Samajwadi Party for fielding candidates with criminal backgrounds, chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday said that after March 10 — when the election results are out — all those history-sheeters who have been given tickets by the opposition would once again seek mercy.“They have a misconception.The rule of law will continue in UP even after March 10. With boards around their neck, they will plead outside police stations that they would run roadside vegetable stalls rather than troubling businessmen and local residents,” Adityanath said at a ‘key voters’ meet’ in Muradnagar. The CM also raked up the Muzaffarnagar riots, Kairana “exodus” and communal tension in Bulandshahr and Moradabad in his 25-minute speech at the meet.“Riots went on for months in Muzaffarnagar. Later, when the Chaudhuries (of Muzaffarnagar) held an assembly, bullets were fired on the farmers who had attended it. They (SP) have no shame. Those whose caps are stained with the blood of the Hindus and those who had opened fire on Ram bhakts are talking about peace and brotherhood. Before 2017, riots used to happen every third day during the SP regime,” he said.Referring to former Muradnagar MLA from BSP (2007-2012) Wahab Chaudhary, Adityanath said that a goon had become the local legislator by mistake, but he was sent to jail after the BJP government came to power. Chaudhary was arrested by the Ghaziabad police in connection with a murder case.He also slammed SP leader Akhilesh Yadav for banning the Kanwar yatra on the pretext of “law and order”. “When our government came, we deployed helicopters to honour the kanwariyas with flower petals and keep an eye on rioters. Now the Kanwar yatra takes place and the atmosphere does not get spoiled,” he said. Accusing SP and BSP of not cooperating with the BJP government during the Covid pandemic and boycotting an all-party meeting called in Lucknow, the CM said, “The situation would have been worse if Covid had come during the tenure of the two opposition parties.” Taking a jibe at opposition parties, he said that voters gave opportunities to SP, BSP and Congress to run the government for 55 years, "but none of them did anything", adding the teams of "Chacha-Bhatija" (Shivpal Yadav-Akhilesh Yadav), "Bua-Bhatija" (Mayawati-Akhilesh Yadav) and "Bhai-Behen" (Rahul Gandhi-Priyanka Gandhi), they don’t have any vision.This was Yogi Adityanath's fourth visit to Ghaziabad ahead of the state assembly polls.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ghaziabad/criminals-with-tickets-will-seek-mercy-after-mar-10/articleshow/89212383.cms||Aditya Dev

In the last 24 hours, three patients succumbed due to the infection in GB Nagar while one person died in Ghaziabad, officials said. In January, GB Nagar has recorded 13 Covid-related fatalities, of which 10 were recorded since January 22. In the neighbouring district, 10 people have died due to the viral infection this month of which five were recorded in the past seven days, data obtained from district health officials showed.Former Ghaziabad MLA Suresh Bansal (80), who was admitted to Yashoda Hospital on January 13 following complaints of breathlessness, succumbed on Saturday. “Bansal had severe breathing problem as the carbon dioxide level in his body had increased. His Covid report came negative on January 26 but due to comorbidities, his condition could not stabilise. Subsequently, he was put on a ventilator but he suffered a heart attack and breathed his last around 10.30 am on Saturday,” medical superintendent Dr Anuj Agarwal told TOI.Meanwhile, the district added only 385 positive cases on the day, while GB Nagar saw 620 new infections. The two districts are at the top of the list of districts with maximum cases after Lucknow, which added 1,705 new cases on the day. The two other districts that reported a high number of cases in the last 24 hours in the state are Jhansi (388 cases, 3 deaths) and Meerut (321 cases).According to health officials, though the number of active cases in GB Nagar was 3,559, at least 967 people had recovered in the last 24 hours. In the neighbouring district, there were 2,249 active cases while 14 people were discharged from hospitals since Friday, they said.

---||Ghaziabad||UP foregone conclusion, real surprise in Gujarat: Akhilesh||Aditya.DevGhaziabad: Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav and his alliance partner, Rashtriya Lok Dal’s (RLD) Jayant Chaudhary, launched a joint attack on BJP at a joint press conference on Saturday, saying the saffron party was behaving like a wrestler who has lost the bout, and people would teach a lesson to those who honour the killers of Mahatma Gandhi.“BJP is nervous and behaving like the wrestler who loses, who sometimes pulls and sometimes bites,” Akhilesh said. Stepping up the ante, with BJP intensifying its outreach to the Jat community in western UP, the former CM said it wasn’t UP but Gujarat that goes to polls later this year, which will throw up the “real surprise”. BJP has won the last six assembly elections in Gujarat. “Every section in UP has accepted that an SP-RLD coalition government is going to be formed in the state,” Akhilesh said.With UP CM Yogi Adityanath repeatedly raking up tickets to candidates with criminal backgrounds in the SP-RLD list, Akhilesh countered by saying there were 82 BJP candidates who have cases against them. There will be no riots and no one is above the law, said the former CM, who has also been targeted by BJP for the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots. Flanked by eight candidates of Gautam Budh Nagar and Ghaziabad, the two leaders said the “arrogant” BJP was forced to bow before the farmers’ year-long agitation against the Centre’s three farm laws.With a bundle of grains in their hands, the two leaders took an “anna sankalp” (pledge) to defeat BJP in the elections and raised slogans of “Bhaichara Zindabad’ (long live brotherhood). They also announced the launch of Samajwadi Thali for Rs 10 and subsidised general stores for the poor.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ghaziabad/up-foregone-conclusion-real-surprise-in-gujarat-akhilesh/articleshow/89212387.cms||Aditya Dev

---||Mumbai||Bombay HC stays AAI’s order to slash height of JVPD buildings||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court has held that the Airports Authority of India (AAI) prima facie has no authority to withdraw the no objection certificates (NOCs) granted for height of a building to be constructed in the upscale Juhu Vile Parle Development Scheme (JVPD). It also said the revocation was retrospective and stayed via an interim order, a revised NOC that reduced the height to 37 metres from the original NOC that had permitted 57 metres. The HC bench of Justices R D Dhanuka and SM Modak was hearing two separate petitions filed by Armaan Real Estate Pvt Ltd and Juhu Gitanjali Vastushilp Co-operative Housing Society Ltd to challenge AAI’s action. AAI case: Residents dishoused, can’t live in uncertainty, says soc counselAshort grievance in these almost identical petitions was that after the AAI or Airports Authority of India granted them NOC for carrying out construction up to a particular height under provisions of the Ministry of Civil Aviation (Height Restrictions for Safeguarding of Aircraft Operations) Rules, 2015, the same authority—AAI--cancelled the earlier nod and issued a revised permission by “reducing the height substantially with retrospective effect.” The HC, on considering the facts and hearing senior counsel Pravin Samdani and Veerendra Tulzapurkar for petitioners, said, “Prima facie, we are of the view that the (AAI and its General Manager (ATM) western region) have no power to cancel the earlier NOC permitting particular height and to substi- tute by another NOC with retrospective effect by substantially reducing the height permission already granted earlier.” AAI counsel Ajay Khaire raised a preliminary objection to the petitions, saying the developers had the alternate remedy of filing an appeal against NOC. He sought time to file an affidavit. The high court gave him up to three weeks to file the affidavit and a rejoinder, if any, to be filed a week thereafter and placed the matter for priority hearing on February 24. The HC, staying the revised NOC, however clarified that if the petitioners carry out any construction on the plots in question from the date of its order, it would be subject to its further orders at the next hearing. The petition by the developer through Maniar Srivastava Associates prima facie indicates that pursuant to the NOC received on May 4, 2021, it took several steps af- ter obtaining further permissions from Maharashtra Housing Area Development Authority (Mhada)—the plot owner--in July and other authorities for construction. The developer was granted commencement certificate for construction on November 9, 2021 on the basis of the Original Height Clearance NOC, which would allow for a 16-floor building. Based on all permissions, the developer informed the HC that it had demolished a building called Mangalya Cooperative Housing Society. The society, represented by advocate Arun Panicker, was leased the land by Mhada for 99 years in 1960 and had 13 members residing in two storied buildings before they were demolished for reconstruction. Senior counsel Birendra Saraf for the society said the residents have been dishoused since last year and cannot now live under uncertainty. The HC said the petition by the housing society though advocate Saket Mone raised “almost identical” facts and legal issues. The building, however, is yet to be demolished, and the HC said once permission is received for construction, it would be subject to its further orders.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/hc-stays-aais-order-to-slash-height-of-jvpd-bldgs/articleshow/89212388.cms||Swati Deshpande

---||Mumbai||After public outcry, SBI suspends note on pregnant candidates||Mumbai: State Bank of India has decided to keep its revised instructions regarding joining letters for pregnant women candidates in abeyance. This follows protests from politicians, women’s rights bodies and a general outcry on social media over the bank’s circular restricting granting of joining letters to women candidates who are over three months pregnant.Swati Maliwal, chairperson, Delhi Commission for Women, taking suo moto cognizance of reports on the new guidelines, issued a notice to the chairman of State Bank of India against its December 31 circular which said that women who were over three months pregnant would be considered temporarily unfit and would not be given joining before delivery. On Saturday, Sena MP Priyanka Chaturvedi wrote to Nirmala Sitharaman and SBI chairman asking for the guidelines to be withdrawn. She pointed out that the extant guidelines that were brought forward in 2009 allowed the appointment of candidates up to six months of pregnancy but have now been revised. She highlighted the issue of the drop in female participation in the workforce. “Such regressive and sexist guidelines will exacerbate the exclusion of women and inequality faced by them,” she said.Amid the row, the country's largest lender said: “SBI has recently reviewed the various fitness standards for recruitment in the bank, including norms for pregnant women candidates. The revised guidelines were intended to provide clarity on various health parameters where instructions were not clear or were very old.” It added that in some sections of the media, the revision in norms in this regard has been interpreted as discriminatory against women.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/after-public-outcry-sbi-suspends-note-on-pregnant-candidates/articleshow/89212406.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Three million fewer women looking for work from 2019 to 2021, shows data||MUMBAI: Not only have more women lost jobs compared to men during the pandemic, but also fewer women are returning to work. The number of women actively looking for work each month reduced by 3 million between 2019 and 2021, says the latest bulletin from Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) and Centre for Economic Data and Analysis (CEDA). CMIE data shows that urban India had 22.1% fewer women employed in 2021 than in 2019. However, while 9.52 million women actively searched for jobs every month in 2019, this declined to only 6.52 million in 2021. This is based on CMIE’s state-wise monthly time-series of employment that goes back to January 2019. This was in contrast with the trend in the male workforce, says CMIE data. The number of male workers actively looking for jobs in 2021 was up by 19.7% in urban India and 14.9% in rural India (compared to 2019). The trend of fewer women seeking a return to work was observed in both urban and rural India. In urban India, only 2.57 million women actively searched for jobs every month in 2021 as compared to 3.87 million in 2019 (a decline of 33.7%), CMIE data showed. In rural India, only 3.95 million women actively looked for jobs in 2021 as compared to 5.16 million in 2020 and 2021 (23.5% less). Four states saw more than 50% decline in average monthly female employment in 2021 than in 2019. These were Tamil Nadu (50.9%), Goa (56%), Jammu and Kashmir (61%), and Punjab (57.9%). Except Jharkhand, all eastern Indian states (West Bengal, Odisha, and Chhattisgarh) registered a significant increase in female employment in 2021 over 2020. Unlike male employment, there was also an urban-rural divide when it came to female employment in the country. Average female employment in urban India in 2021 was 6.9% lower than 2020 and 22.1% lower than the pre-pandemic year, 2019. In rural India however, female employment in 2021 was 9.2% higher than 2020 and 0.1% lower than 2019. So, female employment suffered a significant reversal in urban India since pandemic. “India saw longer periods of school closure than other countries. The increase in child care activities, as a result, may have affected women’s participation in the labour force,” said Ankur Bhardwaj, editor CEDA.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/3mn-fewer-women-looking-for-work-from-2019-to-2021/articleshow/89212407.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

Ajay Pardhi, was admitted to the state Cottage Hospital in Jawhar on January 24 for acute pneumonia. He was declared dead by around 9 pm. As the hospital did not have a hearse to carry the body, three private ambulances were approached. The father Yuvraj, a farm labourer, could not afford the cost of the ambulances and decided to take the body to his village in Sadakwadi on his bike. The body was wrapped in a blanket and placed on the mother’s lap who was riding pillion. A video of the incident went viral after which the drivers of the three private ambulances were suspended. Chief Medical Officer of the hospital Dr Ramdas Marad admitted they do not have a hearse van. He said that while government ambulances are not allowed to transport bodies, the private ambulances were demanding exorbitant rates. Dr Marad said that he was personally trying to arrange for transport to carry the body and had urged the father to wait till morning. The father, however, insisted on taking the body on the bike as he feared an autopsy would be conducted if it was kept in the hospital till the next morning. Dr Marad said that the father was told no autopsy would be needed as it was a death caused by pneumonia. The final rites were performed in the village on Wednesday morning. Vivek Pandit, president of the Shramjeevi Sanghatana, a tribal welfare organisation, said such incidents are common in tribal areas where health facilities are poor.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/tribal-parents-transport-sons-body-on-bike-as-ambulance-too-expensive/articleshow/89212415.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Poll ball set rolling, BMC election may be delayed||MUMBAI: Setting the ball rolling for elections to the BMC and14 other municipal corporations in the state, the State Election Commission (SEC) on Saturday chalked out the timeline for finalising boundaries of wards after they were increased in Mumbai and determining multiple panel wards in the other civic bodies. With the timeline stating the final list of ward limits will be published on March 2, the polls to India’s richest civic corporation, the BMC, are set to be delayed and could possibly be pushed to late March or April. The BMC polls were expected to be held in February as the term of the civic House ends on March 8. All eyes on revised ward boundaries as SEC gears up for civic electionsOnce the new BMC electoral ward limits are decided, the lottery for ward reservation too will have to take place before civic elections are held. The number of electoral wards in the city will increase from 227 to 236. The SEC has directed BMC to publish the revised boundaries of wards on February 1 and invite suggestions/objections up to February 14. A hearing on suggestions/objections received will be held on February 26, and a report will be submitted to the SEC by March 2. The same timetable will apply to other corporations including Thane, which is also going to the polls. The state cabinet had approved the proposal to increase electoral wards in the BMC and to have multiple panel wards for other corporations. The state legislature gave its approval for amending various Acts for it. In a letter to the BMC and other local bodies, SEC has said finalising reservations for OBCs will take some time. The state government had filed a special leave petition in Supreme Court, which directed the state to submit details to the OBC commission. The panel will study data and in turn make recommendations to the state and also to the SEC. “Since taking a decision based on recommendations of the OBC commission will take some time, the SEC in the meantime has decided to finalise ward boundaries. It will be the responsibility of the civic body to complete the exercise within the given timeline and the details are to be posted on the corporation’s website and submit a report to the SEC on completion of each step,” the SEC letter read. The total population of the city, as finalised for the 236 wards, is 12.44 million. The SEC has accepted the ward-wise SC and ST population details provided by the BMC. Of the 236 wards, 50% are reserved for women. Of the 236 wards, 15 wards have been reserved for SCs and two for STs. In March 2021, SC had said reservation for OBCs in state’s local bodies cannot exceed the total ceiling of 50% for SCs, STs and OBCs. After the order, the state appointed a commission to collect empirical data and promulgated an ordinance to give up to 27% reservation to OBCs without exceeding the 50% ceiling. But SC stayed it, saying it cannot be implemented without data. BJP MLA from Mulund Mihir Kotecha said the party will await details of ward boundaries. “It is well known that a political agency affiliated with the ruling party (Shiv Sena) and not BMC has drawn up the ward boundaries. The pen drive submitted to BMC by the agency has been forwarded to the SEC,” he said.  BJP had won 82 seats in the last civic elections and in over 25 seats, it won by a margin of less than 1,000 votes. “There is every likelihood booths have been adjusted such that BJP loses its winning edge. Boundaries are decided by arterial roads and major nullahs,” said BJP sources. In Thane, SEC has okayed 47 multiple panel wards. The ward numbers will go up from 33 to 47. While 46 wards will have 3 members, ward No. 44 will have 4. The total representatives will go to 142 from 131.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/all-eyes-on-revised-ward-boundaries-as-sec-gears-up-for-civic-elections/articleshow/89212418.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Mumbai||BMC polls at the end of March or in April: Official||MUMBAI: With the SEC laying out the schedule for the run-up to the BMC polls and stating that final list of ward boundaries will be published on March 2, BMC elections are set to be delayed. The term of the BMC House ends on March 8, 2022. If elections are announced before March 8, the current body of corporators will cease to exist and powers will be vested in the BMC chief. A BMC official said, “Civic polls could happen either at end of March or the first week of April. We are already working on increasing the number of polling booths keeping in mind the Covid situation.” During the 2017 civic polls, the elections were held in mid-February, and the lottery for ward reservation was held in October 2016. This time, this is yet to be done, and it will happen only after the process of suggestions/objections is completed and the final list of ward boundaries is out on March 2. Reservations for corporator seats are changed every five years through a system of lottery. In the past, there have been instances when an administrator was appointed for BMC when elections got postponed. During D M Sukthankar’s tenure as BMC chief BMC polls were postponed. The House term ended in March 1984, and the then government appointed the BMC chief as ‘administrator.’ But civic officials said in the current Act, there is no provision to appoint an administrator.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/bmc-polls-at-the-end-of-march-or-in-april-official/articleshow/89212419.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Congress undecided on whether to go solo for BMC polls||MUMBAI: Consensus is eluding the Congress over whether it should contest the approaching BMC elections independently or jointly with the NCP and Shiv Sena.  At a high-level meeting presided over by AICC general secretary H K Patil, no final decision was taken except that opinions of stakeholders and BMC councillors should be taken before arriving at any decision. Accordingly, Congress councillors will meet within a week to discuss the matter. Besides Patil, the meeting was attended by cabinet members Aslam Shaikh, Varsha Gaikwad, Mumbai Congress president Bhai Jagtap, working president Charansingh Sapra, former minister Naseem Khan, Amin Patel and former Mumbai Congress president Milind Deora. According to reports, Aslam Shaikh took the view that in view of the performance of the Maha Vikas Aghadi government, it would be appropriate to contest the elections under the MVA banner, while school education minister Varsha Gaikwad felt that for maintaining the identity of the party, Congress should contest the polls independently. Jagtap has already declared that the Congress should contest the polls separately. Leader of opposition Ravi Raja felt that politically it would be wise to contest the elections jointly as part of the MVA. The three parties in the state government are yet to decide on contesting the elections under the MVA banner. While Sena and BJP have geared up for the BMC elections, for the Congress this was the first meeting. BJP’s strategy and campaign are being monitored by Devendra Fadnavis and city BJP president Mangal Prabhat Lodha. In the recent past, Fadnavis presided over at least half-a-dozen meetings of BJP leaders. CM Uddhav Thackeray too had an online discussion with Sena leaders in Mumbai.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/cong-undecided-on-whether-to-go-solo-for-city-polls/articleshow/89212421.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Anil Deshmukh bought 86 acres with Rs 3 crore unaccounted cash||MUMBAI: Former state home minister Anil Deshmukh allegedly used Rs 3.3 crore unaccounted money to purchase 86 acres of land in Nagpur and Navi Mumbai over a decade ago. The money was the part of Rs30 crore unaccounted cash that Deshmukh, with the help of associates, allegedly brought into the banking channel through hawala operators, shell companies and fictitious business transactions. Deshmukh used this money to purchase land, establish warehouse and hotel businesses and manage his Nagpur-based educational trust, the ED said in its chargesheet against Deshmukh. The Deshmukh family also gave Rs 13.25 crore in cash to a Delhi-based hawala operator, who layered the money through fictitious transactions and transferred it into the account of Deshmukh’s Nagpur trust, Shri Sai Shikshan Sanstha,under the guise of donations after charging around 1.5 % commission on the total amount. This unaccounted money is different from the Rs 4.7 crore that dismissed police officer Sachin Waze had allegedly illegally collected from bar owners and paid to then home minister Deshmukh. In the chargesheet against Deshmukh, his sons Hrishikesh and Salil, along with nine others, the ED alleged that the former minister and his family had infused unaccounted cash into companies indirectly controlled by them to purchase land. Afterwards, the Deshmukh family purchased these companies at throwaway prices through the companies that directly controlled them. Greenland Buildspace, a company indirectly controlled by Deshmukh, had purchased 40 acres of land in Chakkikhapa for Rs 81 lakh in 2010. The very next year, the Deshmukhs purchased Greenland Buildspace along with its assets, investing Rs 3.65 lakh through a set of four companies directly controlled by them, namely Concrete Enterprises, Concrete Real Estate, Ayati Gems and Atlantic Vista Real Estate. Through the same four companies in the same year, the family had purchased another company indirectly controlled by them, Meadows Realtors, along with its assets for Rs 3 lakh. Just before the transaction, Meadows Realtors had purchased 22 acres at Bharatwada and 4 acres at Chakkikhapa (both in Nagpur) for Rs 33 lakh, which became Deshmukh’s property after the firm’s acquisition. Later, between 2017 and 2019, the Deshmukh family sold the land bought by Greenland Buildspace and Meadows Realtors for Rs 4.85 crore and Rs 2.43 crore, respectively. Similarly, the Deshmukhs had invested Rs 2 crore in Premier Port Links (PPL) company through Flourish Properties, which was indirectly controlled by them. PPL had purchased around 20 acres of agricultural land in Dhutum Village, Uran taluka in Navi Mumbai in 2004-08 to set up a customs freight station. Afterwards, Salil and Hrishikesh became 50% owners of PPL, along with the land in its possession worth several hundred crores, after an investment of merely Rs 18 lakh. In his statement to the ED, Deshmukh said that he doesn’t know about the funds received by Shri Sai Shikshan Sanstha as he was not involved in its day-to-day affairs. He also told ED that he has no knowledge of companies controlled by his family members and does not know about the source of funds used to purchase land.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/deshmukh-bought-86-acres-with-3cr-unaccounted-cash/articleshow/89212422.cms||Vijay V Singh

The managing committee of Surat Diamond Bourse (SDB) is competitively diverting trade from the Mumbai bourse by using a new carrot and stick policy. A senior official from BDB said, “We were the ones who helped set up SDB by sharing with them our bye-laws and security processes. Our security is the best in India. Their bye-laws are a copy-paste job of ours. Now we feel betrayed. The SDB has issued a circular inviting diamond merchants to shift their operations and sales from Mumbai to their premises in Surat, offering them incentives to move. Members who stop the sale of polished diamonds from Mumbai and do so from the Surat bourse by December 31, 2022, will be included on a list of SDB pioneers. Their names will be displayed for a lifetime in the reception area of the Surat bourse. Moreover, maintenance charges will be waived for six months.” SDB members who continue to despatch polished diamonds to Mumbai for sale will not be given the rebate, and their names will not be included in this august list. The BDB official said, “Our name incorporates the word ‘Bharat’ which signifies that we work for the entire nation while SDB is thinking for Surat only.” However, the BDB committee declined to confront the matter officially, saying they did not wish to interfere with the policies of Surat traders. Anup Zaveri, BDB treasurer, reportedly informed Gujarati media that they will not stop traders who wish to migrate to Surat. He said, “We will not interfere in any individual’s decision. Those who wish to do business in BDB are welcome to do so while others who prefer to go there [Surat] can go. After all, people conduct trade in all parts of the world.” Meanwhile, Mahesh Gadhavi, CEO of the SDB, said, “The only aim behind offering incentives to members is to get the Surat bourse up and running swiftly. There is no rivalry or competitiveness at play. In fact the senior functionaries of both BDB and SDB are always exchanging thoughts on planning, operations and other issues for the growth and betterment of the gems and jewellery industry.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/citys-diamond-traders-feel-betrayed-by-surat-bourse/articleshow/89212423.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Drive to create awareness about leprosy||MUMBAI: The BMC has organised a leprosy awareness drive, along with a door-to-door visits and surveys between January 30 and February 14 as a part of the National Leprosy Eradication Programme. The drive, which will be held in all the 24 municipal wards, will focus on dispelling the misconceptions about leprosy, a contagious disease that affects the skin, mucous membranes and nerves and could lead to disfigurement and deformities. Although India had declared leprosy as an eliminated disease, cases suddenly shot up in 2018-19 in urban pockets such as Mumbai. In 2018, 362 new cases were reported as against 326 in the previous year. The BMC’s Sparsh awareness campaign will aim to dispel misconceptions about the condition by organizing oath-taking ceremonies at schools and colleges, street plays and screening camps. “In addition, we will also carry out door-to-door visits and surveys,’’ said BMC executive health officer Mangala Gomare.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/drive-to-create-awareness-about-leprosy/articleshow/89212424.cms||---

The money was deducted from the complainant’s account in a single transaction and this is when she approached the Matunga police station.The complainant, a retired Philosophy professor, visited the Matunga police and stated that she had received an SMS asking to update her KYC details for the SIM card of her mobile phone.The message had further stated that if the KYC was not updated soon, her card would be blocked. A contact number was given in the message too. The complainant called up the number and the phone receiver introduced himself as an executive of the SIM card company. He tricked the woman into downloading AnyDesk, a screen sharing app, on her phone and collected her bank account details. “Once the complainant downloaded the app and shared an OTP with the accused, he got access to the complainant’s mobile phone. He used the OTP to transfer Rs 3 lakh from her account to a money transfer service’s e-wallet,” said a police officer. The complainant used to get her pension in the account which was targeted by the cybercriminal. A police team comprising PSI Rajabhau Garad, Vinod Dhurve contacted the payment gateway company and stopped the money transfer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/cops-foil-kyc-scam-of-3l-within-15-mins-of-complaint/articleshow/89212425.cms||Mateen Hafeez
---||Mumbai||In perhaps 1st for city, teen faces organised crime Act||Mumbai: City police have invoked the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) against a minor and three others in an alleged attempt-to-murder case. This is perhaps the first case in the city where a minor has been booked under the MCOCA, an officer said. The minor is currently lodged at Dongri remand home. This is the first time this teen has been booked in any case. The gang, said police, had created terror in Chembur.MCOCA was invoked in the case where Shamil Mhatre (27), a hotel waiter, had lodged a complaint of attempt to murder, assault and criminal intimidation. Police said on January 8, around 6.15pm, “gang leader” Chhotu Suresh Ulendla alias Prem (23) along with his co-accused—Vivek Bondre alias Butter, Hiralal Gupta alias Sonu and the minor—assaulted the complainant with cement paver blocks and an iron rod and tried to kill him after he refused to pay them money. Mhatre sustained severe injuries to his head, wrists and feet. During the probe, police found there were around 30 criminal cases registered against the gang members over the past 10 years. The cases include rape, attempted murder, burglary, extortion, threatening to kill with sharp weapons, attacking government employees and obstructing government work. “This the first case in which the minor (aged 17 years and three months) has been booked,” said an officer. MCOCA has been invoked in the case and hence all those named in it will face the anti-gangster law which was introduced in Maharashtra in 1999 to tackle the underworld. Sections under MCOCA are non-bailable. It was Jayakumar Suryavanshi, senior inspector, Chembur police station, who on January 21 submitted a proposal to invoke MCOCA against the gang. Sanjay Darade, additional commissioner of police, cleared the proposal on January 28. “These accused had created terror in the area,” said a cop. While Prem, Butter and Sonu were arrested and sent to jail in the case, the minor is lodged at Dongri remand home. This is the third MCOCA case in Zone VI (Chembur, Mankhurd and RCF areas) against three gangs this year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/in-perhaps-1st-for-city-teen-faces-organised-crime-act/articleshow/89212426.cms||Mateen Hafeez
---||Mumbai||Reply why Nitesh Rane must not be given bail: Court to state, police||MUMBAI: A day after Supreme Court directed Union minister Narayan Rane’s son, Nitesh, to surrender before a local trial court and seek regular bail, on Friday he sought bail before a sessions court in Sindhudurg which issued notice to police and state, asking to reply why he should not be granted bail. On January 27, the SC did not interfere with a Bombay high court’s January 17 order, rejecting Rane’s anticipatory bail in an attempt to murder case but granted him 10 days time, till February 6, to surrender before a local trial court and seek regular bail. The HC in its order had said that it is required to balance the conflicting considerations of personal liberty and need for proper investigation in a larger societal interest. Special public prosecutor Pradeep Gharat had during a hearing via video-conference opposed the bail application and said the sessions court cannot entertain his bail plea. He said Rane has been given reasonable time to surrender before the trial court and he must be forwarded and produced before the local “magistrate” who has the power to deal with his custody. Rane’s counsel S D Desai and Satish Maneshinde cited the SC order to say that since the offence is triable by the special Sessions court, it has the power to hear and decide his bail application. Additional sessions judge R B Rote in his order said, “No specific written application for surrender has been filed by the applicant. The Supreme Court has granted interim protection against his arrest for a period of 10 days from January 27. Therefore, considering the facts and the order passed by the Supreme Court, it is necessary to decide the application on merits by calling the detailed reply of the investigating officer.” Rane’s counsel said the special trial court has jurisdiction to try the ‘attempt to murder’ case, and thus can entertain his bail plea. He relied on the SC ruling of 2014 where it was “observed that Criminal Procedure doesn’t prohibit surrender before sessions court or high court.” The SC had said, “If the petitioner surrenders before the concerned trial court and applies for regular bail, it shall be considered and disposed of on its own merits and in accordance with law, expeditiously.”  Gharat submitted that if Rane surrenders, he has to be forwarded and produced before the magistrate who then has to deal with him as per section 167 of Criminal Procedure Code and remand him in its custody. Rane’s counsel also submitted that the appropriate court for surrender and consideration of his bail application was the sessions court in view of the fact that an offence of attempt to murder is exclusively triable by the sessions court. They said submitting to jurisdiction of sessions court is surrender and in view of the 2014 Judgement of SC arrest by police was not mandatory.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/reply-why-nitesh-rane-must-not-be-given-bail-court-to-state-police/articleshow/89212427.cms||Swati Deshpande

TOI had reported on January 6 about the BCCI thinking that the BCCI, in plan B, was looking at staging the entire IPL this year in Maharashtra itself.The league stage of the forthcoming edition of the IPL will be held at three venues in Mumbai — the Wankhede Stadium, Brabourne Stadium in Cricket Club of India, the DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai, and the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium in Gahunje, near Pune. The playoffs could be held at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. “Yes, I believe that the IPL is coming to CCI, and we’ll be very glad to host it,” CCI president Premal Udani told TOI. 25% crowd allowed The good news for cricket fans is that the matches in the glitzy T20 league may not be played in empty stadiums, after all. TOI has learnt that “some crowd” may be allowed at venues in the league stage in Maharashtra, provided the covid situation remains under control, and the number of cases are low in Mumbai and Pune.“If the number of positive cases aren’t high around that time, the state government authorities are likely to allow around 25% capacity crowds for this year’s IPL. A top politician, who is a central figure in the present Maharashtra government, and the BCCI officials had earlier this month met Aseem Gupta, State Principal secretary of relief and rehabilitation, on this issue. The idea is to replicate the ‘model’ of the Wankhede Test match last December between India and New Zealand at the Wankhede Stadium, which saw crowds being allowed up to 25% of the capacity of the venue, as per the state government guidelines in view of the threat from the Omicron variant. As per that guideline, 50% capacity was allowed indoors, which means that corporate boxes, and perhaps the press box, could be filled up to 50% of the capacity,” a reliable source told this paper. “Even in the present situation, the Maharashtra government, as per its last order on covid norms, is keen to organize national and international sporting events as long as a strict bio-bubble, and all the covid protocols are maintained. This is why the state govt has allowed the ongoing AFC Women’s Asian Cup in Mumbai and Pune, the Tata Open tennis tournament in Pune and the next edition of the IPL in the same cities,” said the source.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/ipl-in-india-maharashtra-to-hold-league-gujarat-the-po/articleshow/89212430.cms||---

The gardens will be developed, without causing any damage to mangroves, at Karla and Juve under the Chiplun range forest office. Approximately Rs 20 crore will be spent for this purpose. The Konkan belt has several tourist spots and new avenues are being explored to attract more tourists. The mangrove belt is one among them. The construction of the gardens will also draw employment for several. Ratnagiri Guardian minister Anil Parab has said that the Karla belt in Ratnagiri taluka, will have a one mangrove garden, spread over 4.79 hectares of area, while the other mangrove garden will come up in Rajapur Taluka in Jaitapur and will be spread over 10.60 hectares.

It also decided to allow pubs, bars, hotels and restaurants to operate with 100% occupancy. “The Covid positivity rate in the state has come down from its peak of 33% last week to 20.9% as of today. The overall hospitalisation rate was 1.9%. This shows the third wave is on the decline. So, the government has decided to do away with most of the restrictions,” revenue minister R Ashoka said. The decision was taken at a high-level meeting chief minister Basavaraj Bommai had with his senior cabinet colleagues and members of the Covid Technical Advisory Committee. The government also decided to allow Namma Metro services and public and private transport buses to ply with 100 per cent seating capacity. The number of people at weddings in open spaces has been increased to 300 and 200 for weddings in closed premises. Similarly, it was decided that services and pujas at religious places will be allowed with an entry limit of 50 people at a time. 50% occupancy rule for cinema halls, gyms staysGovernment offices, including state secretariat, can function with100 per cent occupancy.

It also decided to allow pubs, bars, hotels and restaurants to operate with 100% occupancy. “The Covid positivity rate in the state has come down from its peak of 33% last week to 20.9% as of today. The overall hospitalisation rate was 1.9%. This shows the third wave is on the decline. So, the government has decided to do away with most of the restrictions,” revenue minister R Ashoka said. The decision was taken at a high-level meeting chief minister Basavaraj Bommai had with his senior cabinet colleagues and members of the Covid Technical Advisory Committee. The government also decided to allow Namma Metro services and public and private transport buses to ply with 100 per cent seating capacity. The number of people at weddings in open spaces has been increased to 300 and 200 for weddings in closed premises.

But some are experiencing FOMO for a different reason in the third wave — with their colleagues/peers being infected with Covid-19, they’re feeling ‘left out’. Social media platforms are abuzz with memes and jokes about the ‘rare species’ who are still not sick, while others are suffering from cough, fever and body ache. One viral meme reads: “If you not sick right now, you must be a alien.” Another has a healthy person detesting himself when everyone else is contracting Covid. Youngsters are sharing their ‘disappointment’ online. Shivangi, a Twitter user, said: “People who did not get covid in wave two got it in wave three and those who did not get in wave three, unko major FOMO ho raha hai (they are suffering from major FOMO) .” Siriveena tweeted: “The struggle of having bad FOMO while also being terrified of covid.” Karthik Srinivasan, a communications consultant, shared an anecdote from his family: “Was speaking to a relative. She said her son (in Std 11) wanted to get tested for COVID because it seems to be a FOMO among his friends in class/school — almost everyone’s getting tested and ones not getting tested are feeling left out! He tested positive, btw!” Anushree L, a techie, who has never contracted the infection, told STOI she shared a story on Instagram joking about how she tested positive for FOMO. “Last week, everyone except two of us in my team tested positive. My story was in response to their stories on how they had got infected. I heard their symptoms were not severe. Everyone got get-well-soon goodies and I felt excluded,” she said, adding it was only in a lighter vein and she was aware of the virus’ seriousness. “I have remained cautious since the first two waves because I live with elderly parents. I think all my sanitising, masking and eating healthy has paid off in a way,” she added. Zoha Sanofer, an influencer on Instagram, shared a reel that showed the change in people’s attitude towards Covid from 2021 to 2022. With the caption “Different wave, different vibe?,” Sanofer says people were terrified of Covid-19 in 2021 but are casual about it this year. “It’s only Corona. Don’t worry, it is only for seven days, you will be fine after that,” she says in the skit-like reel which has garnered over 11,000 likes. Netizens have also come up with a term for those who have still not contracted Covid — Covirgins. “I officially lost my COVID virginity, now I don’t have to worry about having FOMO,” a Twitter user wrote.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/memes-on-covid-fomo-flood-social-media/articleshow/89212433.cms||Farheen Hussain
---||Bengaluru||276 of 505 patients hospitalised in past week fully jabbed in Bengaluru: Palike data||BENGALURU: Which category of Covid patients is getting hospitalised more in Bengaluru: Fully vaccinated or those who haven’t taken the jab? That is the question Covid trackers and medical professionals have been asking in recent days with the case fatality rate having jumped to 0.06 per cent this week as against the 0.03 per cent recorded last week. Hospitalisation-related data accessed by STOI for the past one week reveals the number of fully vaccinated patients is more than that of the unvaccinated and those who have taken one shot. BBMP data shows a total of 505 Covid patients were admitted to hospitals last week for various reasons, including comorbidities. Of these, 172 were in the general ward, 161 in high dependency units, 98 in ICU and 74 on ICU-ventilators. Of the 505, a total of 276 patients were fully vaccinated against Covid-19. While 184 were not jabbed, 45 had received the first dose. While some doubt the efficacy of vaccines during the third wave, that is dominated by the Omicron variant, doctors treating Covid patients counter this by stating that vaccination has been preventing patients’ health conditions from deteriorating. Dr Bhaskar Rajakumar, nodal officer of BBMP war room, said vaccines increase immunity levels and prevent people from getting severe infection. There is no reason to doubts the benefits of vaccination, he stressed, adding that data analysis suggests vaccine efficacy is higher in adults with immuno-compromising conditions if they have received both the doses. Interestingly, Bengaluru Urban (including BBMP) has achieved 82 per cent vaccination coverage (as on January 23 for both doses).  “There are other factors at play with regard to people getting hospitalised. In fact, non-adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour (CAB) leads to people contracting the virus at a faster rate,” Dr Rajakumar said. ‘Mask rules flouted’Colonel Rajbhir Singh, BBMP chief marshal, who heads the team that enforces CAB, including wearing mask in public places, said: “Though we repeatedly announce the importance of masks and social distancing at public places, people continue to flout rules. The rules are not meant to prevent them only from spreading the virus, but also from contracting it.” A senior BBMP health official said: “We have noticed that 80% of those who are in ICU and ICU-V have comorbidities like hypertension, diabetes and liver diseases.” Surprisingly, the remaining 20% of ICU-V admissions are divided between the 13-18 and 19-40 age groups. These categories neither have any comorbidities nor have they been vaccinated.” Dr AS Balasundar, chief health officer (BBMP), said: “As of today, 184 non-vaccinated people have been admitted to hospital. Vaccination may not prevent people from contracting the virus, but it prevents severity and further complications.” Regarding vaccination status and deaths, data was not available.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/276-of-505-patients-hospitalised-in-past-week-fully-jabbed-palike-data/articleshow/89212434.cms||Nithya Mandyam

Around 15 lakh vehicles are being registered in Karnataka every year, of which around 90% are non-transport vehicles. States like Maharashtra, Kerala, Gujarat, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Haryana, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Odisha, Telangana and Assam have already rolled out dealer-point registration (DPR). Under DPR, registration of non-transport vehicles with fully built body from manufacturers can be done at the dealer level itself. This is expected to reduce time taken for registration of vehicles, corruption, paperwork and workload. RTOs across the state are facing severe staff shortage. As part of DPR, dealers will upload all documents (relevant forms, insurance etc.) on the Parivahan portal once a customer selects a new vehicle and makes the payment at the showroom. A receipt with registration number will be generated online once tax is paid and a high security registration plate (HSRP) will be fixed in an hour. This means a customer who visits an automobile showroom could return home with the vehicle the same day. “The Centre is now insisting on undertaking various reforms like e-payment of taxes, dealer-point registration, online application for registration, contactless issuance of learner’s licence, etc. There are complaints of a nexus between some lower-level officials and middlemen,” said a senior transport department official. He said vehicle data and sale amount details are obtained from the portal so the dealer can’t edit them. Motor vehicle tax is also calculated based on the sale amount. Officials said the Motor Vehicles Act, 2019 empowers the state government to delegate authority to any other individual/agency to register new vehicles (with fully built body). The department also mandates dealers to provide a bank guarantee of Rs 20 lakh with respect to four-wheelers and Rs 5 lakh for two-wheelers before they are appointed as registering authority. The transport department’s move to stop issuing smart cards for RCs and DLs and to provide them only in digital format also remains on paper. The Centre had allowed motorists across the country to use mParivahan or DigiLocker on mobile phones from October 1, 2020 instead of carrying physical documents while travelling. “It is paperless as well as environment friendly. In the present digital era, most people carry only gadgets so it is better to do away with the age-old practice of carrying RCs physically,” said an official. There have been several complaints on delay in getting new RCs or DLs due to shortage of smart cards. The plan was to allow motorists to use digitally signed certificates like RCs and DLs through DigiLocker or let them show printouts if any traffic cop or transport official asks for them. They can also laminate the digital document on the lines of Aadhaar. In 2009, the department switched from paper-based licences and RCs to smart cards. However, neither the department nor traffic police had card readers so there was no way to check their authenticity. ‘Waiting for final HC order’"In most developed countries, registration of vehicles is done at the dealer level. Most states in India have implemented this. We are also following this based on the Centre’s decision to make the vehicle registration process seamless and reduce delays and corruption. The Centre has already permitted vehicle documents in digital mode. But PILs were filed against these two proposals so we are awaiting for a final order from the high court to implement them here" said Rajendra Kumar Kataria, principal secretary, transport department.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/dealer-point-vehicle-registration-digital-rcs-yet-to-be-rolled-out/articleshow/89212435.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

---||Bengaluru||70 Ola, Uber cabs booked at Bengaluru airport||BENGALURU: The transport department on Saturday booked several cabs attached to Ola and Uber at Kempegowda International Airport for not renewing cab aggregator licence. Sources said Ola’s licence expired in June 2021 and Uber’s in December 2021. While both cab aggregators applied for licence renewal, the transport department is yet to issue them. L Narendra Holkar, additional commissioner of transport (enforcement), said: “Licences of both Ola and Uber have expired. They applied for renewal but there are several short-comings in their applications. It’s illegal to run Ola and Uber cabs in the city,” he said, adding they booked cases against 70 cabs. “Most drivers were unaware licences had expired. We have decided to intensify the crackdown. If required, we will seize vehicles,” Holkar said. Airport cab drivers staged a protest against the drive. Shaik Salauddin, national general secretary, Indian Federation of App-Based Transport Workers, said the department seized several Ola/Uber cabs on KIA road. Ola and Uber were unavailable for comments. Both received licence from the department to run taxis in the city in 2016 under Karnataka On-Demand Transportation Technology Aggregators Rules, 2016. “Why are drivers being harassed when firms have not renewed licence? The government should send a legal notice to aggregators,” said Salauddin.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/70-ola-uber-cabs-booked-at-kia/articleshow/89212436.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||No permit required for green vehicles to ply in state||Bengaluru: Electric vehicles (EVs) and vehicles that run on alternative fuel such as methanol and ethanol will not require permits to ply in the state. On Friday, the transport department issued a notification stating that transport vehicles operated by battery, ethanol and methanol will be exempted from permits. However, department-fixed fare will be applicable for transportation of passengers and goods. In October 2018, the Union ministry of road transport and highways issued a notification to exempt EVs and vehicles run on biofuel from permits. However, Karnataka is implementing this only now. At present, permits are required by commercial vehicles, including contract and stage carriage buses, goods carriers and cabs. The move to end the permit era for environment-friendly vehicles is expected to encourage more fleet owners to induct such vehicles. It is also likely to reduce corruption in issuance of permits. However, these vehicles will have to comply with other rules such as fitness certificate and passenger insurance cover. Officials said they are hoping for an increase in the number of electric buses and battery-run autorickshaws now. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/no-permit-required-for-green-vehicles-to-ply-in-state/articleshow/89212437.cms||---

In the advertisement (expression of interest) published on January 25, the state-run transport utility said it received permission from the government to accept the best offer for availing the term loan to pay off its dues. The utility said its property will be collateral for the loan. KSRTC is under financial distress following the pandemic due to a dip in earnings, especially on long-distance routes.. “We issued a notification for loan requirements. But we have not decided on the property for mortgage. Banks can submit their bids before February 8,” said a KSRTC official. However, many employees alleged the utility is planning to mortgage Majestic bus station. KSRTC plans to raise the loan from nationalised or scheduled commercial banks. Earlier, BMTC had issued a similar ad and raised Rs 160 crore loan from Canada Bank after mortgaging Shantinagar TTMC.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/ksrtc-seeks-220-crore-bank-loan/articleshow/89212438.cms||---

This has been the RTCs’ long-pending demand and is now being examined positively by the MR Srinivasa Murthy committee set up to look into their financial and performance improvements. In 2020, all employees of Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation were absorbed into government service to fulfil the election promise made by YS Jagan Mohan Reddy. In Karnataka, employees of Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC), Karnataka State Road Transportation Corporation (KSRTC), Kalyana Karnataka Road Transport Corporation (KKRTC) and North-Western Karnataka Road Transport Corporation (NWKRTC) have been mounting pressure on the government to merge the entities. The government, which was initially hesitant, is now indicating its willingness. “We are keeping an open mind on this as part of our game-changing reforms that are essential for turning around the sick transport corporations. While practically there are no other means to shore them up, we are examining all options, including taking over the corporations; even a merger is under examination,” said transport minister B Sriramulu. He said chief minister Basavaraj Bommai has asked his department to come up with a practical solution as the present system has proven to be unviable. The annual expenditure of the four RTCs, employing nearly 1.8 lakh people, is pegged at Rs 11,750 crore. Experts say this can be brought down by at least 40% through administrative reforms, while the rest can be funded through subsidy and asset monetisation. “We are receiving inputs from all corners before preparing the report, which will be submitted in March,” said Srinivasa Murthy. He said the focus is on leveraging technology to make fare collection entirely cashless so that revenue leakage can be effectively plugged, and on shifting from fossil fuel to CNG and adding electric vehicles to the fleet of buses to help reduce cost.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/ailing-rtcs-may-be-merged-staffers-set-to-get-new-status/articleshow/89212439.cms||B V Shiva Shankar

He had launched these centres in 12 districts on January 26. Bommai has written to officials of e-governance, RDPR and revenue departments and deputy commissioners of all districts in this regard. Saying that he himself will review implementation of the programme every week, the CM sought speedy disposal of petitions received at these centres. “If any plea is rejected, officials must mention the reasons. DCs and senior officials should review the petitions and initiate disciplinary action against those who reject them erroneously. The additional chief secretary, e-governance department, has been instructed to convene weekly meetings on Grama One for the next two months,’’ Bommai said. He also reviewed the functioning of Karnataka Food Corporation and instructed officials to conduct an impact assessment to ensure the success of government-sponsored food parks in Bagalkot, Hiriyuru, Malur, and Jewargi.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/grama-one-centres-in-all-villages-by-feb-end-cm/articleshow/89212440.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Basavaraj Bommai govt only an extension of BSY regime in Karnataka: Siddaramaiah||BENGALURU: A day after chief minister Basavaraj Bommai presented a report card on the performance of his six-month-old government, the Congress alleged the government has failed on all fronts. Former chief minister Siddaramaiah said the government is nothing but an extension of the regime run by BS Yediyurappa. “The previous government was corrupt and the same has continued under Bommai’s leadership,” he alleged, citing the Karnataka Contractors’ Association’s recent claims of 40% kickbacks being demanded by ministers, officials and elected representatives for awarding government tenders and releasing payments. He said the Congress will raise the corruption issue at the next legislature session beginning February 14 and expose the government. The opposition leader also claimed that Bommai’s report card was filled with lies and distorted statistics. For instance, the report claims the government has upgraded 25 district hospitals, given facelift to 750 schools, and constructed 5 lakh houses. But all this is in paper only, Siddaramaiah said. He ridiculed the BJP government’s claim of effectively handling the pandemic. “The government is lying by showing 38,000 Covid deaths. According to me, 3.5-4 lakh people have died, largely during the second wave, as they couldn’t find hospital beds, ventilators, oxygen, ambulance, and life-saving drugs,” Siddaramaiah said. Electoral reforms need of the hour: SpeakerSpeaker Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri on Saturday called for electoral reforms to end caste, wealth and muscle power in democracy. He said it is not enough to point fingers at politicians; people from all walks of life should strive to find solutions. “Loopholes in the electoral system will lead to a state of lawlessness,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/bommai-govt-only-an-extension-of-bsy-regime-siddaramaiah/articleshow/89212441.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Silk carpet exporter’s detention upheld||Bengaluru: The high court has upheld the detention of an exporter under the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act, 1974, popularly known as Cofeposa. Observing that it is evident from the detention order that the detenu, Gurmeet Singh Kohli, has the potentiality to engage in offences, the court dismissed the habeas corpus petition of his daughter, Kiran Ichha Kaur Bhasin. Gurmeet, who claims to be an exporter of Indian hand-knotted silk carpets, was detained by an order dated February 23, 2021 and lodged at Bengaluru Central Prison. The allegation is that he and his son Amanpuneet Singh Kohli were involved in hoodwinking customs officials by claiming fraudulent duty drawbacks amounting Rs 4.1 crore and undue IGST refunds to the tune of Rs 33 crore. “The adequacy of the material on the basis of which the subjective satisfaction has been formed cannot be examined by this court. The material upon which the aforesaid subjective satisfaction has been arrived at is not extraneous to the scope or purpose of the legislative provision. All the documents have been admittedly supplied to the detenu. Therefore, the contention that the material was not supplied to him is sans substance,” a division bench headed by justice Alok Aradhe said. On grounds of the detention, the bench noted that various cases registered against the detenu have been referred to and reference has been made to audio recordings recovered from his devices. “The detaining authority has also referred to the gist of conversation between the detenu and Syed Ahmed, Chain Singh, and Sarvanand Thangavel. On the basis of the material, the detaining authority stated that 14 companies were being operated/controlled by the detenu along with his son. There was adequate material before the authority, on the basis of which subjective satisfaction was recorded by it,” the bench added. The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, Bengaluru, had gathered information that M/s Terrain Overseas India, M/s Truecom Multi Ventures Pvt Ltd, and M/s Sunvistaa Trading Pvt Ltd were misdeclaring the description and value of goods in shipping bills filed by them for export to fraudulently claim duty drawback and IGST refund benefits. Thereafter, on January 6, 2020, a search was conducted at the residential premises of Gurmeet and his statement was recorded. He had handed over his three mobile phones to the officers. An order of detention under section 3(1) of the Act was passed to prevent him from abetment and smuggling of goods. Kiran challenged the detention order, claiming the documents taken into consideration while forming the subjective satisfaction were not furnished to her father. However, Madhukar Deshpande, the central government standing counsel, said all documents have been supplied to the detenu and the authority relied on the quasi-judicial orders.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/silk-carpet-exporters-detention-upheld/articleshow/89212442.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||KSRTC driver’s conviction shouldn’t affect career: Karnataka HC||BENGALURU: Coming to the rescue of a Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation driver, the high court said he need only pay the fine imposed by the trial court and the conviction shouldn’t affect his career or employment. Disposing of a revision petition filed by H Devendrappa, Justice Sreenivas Harish Kumar said the sentence imposed is confined to the fines of Rs 1,000 for the offence under section 279 of IPC (rash driving on a public way) and Rs 500 under section 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) with default sentence as ruled by the trial court. The judge said in the Rajbir Singh vs state of Haryana case (1985), the Supreme Court had said conviction of an accused should not affect his service. Also, in the GT Ravindra vs state of Karnataka case (2012), the high court had observed that conviction and sentence should not affect employment of the accused. The case against Devendrappa was that on August 14, 2014, the KSRTC bus he was driving collided with a private bus at Charmadi Ghat. The accident was attributed to his rash driving. Based on the evidence presented by passengers, eyewitnesses, and driver and cleaner of the private bus, a court in Belthangady convicted Devendrappa for offences under sections 279 and 337 on December 6, 2019. He was sentenced to two months’ simple imprisonment with a fine of Rs 1,000 and default sentence of 15 days’ imprisonment for offence under section 279, and two months’ simple imprisonment with a fine of Rs 500 and default sentence of 15 days for offence under section 337. An appeal against this order was dismissed by the 4th additional district and sessions judge, Dakshina Kannada, on August 4, 2021. Devendrappa then filed a revision petition in the high court, seeking a lenient view in the matter, considering that the sentences could affect his employment/career.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/ksrtc-drivers-conviction-shouldnt-affect-career-hc/articleshow/89212443.cms||Vasantha Kumar

The accused are realtor G Venkatesh, 50, Rakesh Kumar, 29, both from Banaswadi, M Nataraju, 50, of Vellore in Tamil Nadu, and Balaji alias Bala, 41, of Krishnagiri, TN. Nataraju was convicted by a Chittoor court in AP in a murder case in 2018 and had been absconding since. They allegedly robbed a woman’s car driver in October 2021. “The woman, J Sangeeta from Anantapur, had come to the city with driver Avalu Krishnaiah to meet Venkatesh. Initially, she contacted Venkatesh to purchase land on the outskirts of the city. But Venkatesh and Nataraju convinced Sangeeta and Krishnaiah they could almost double their money and offered to give more than Rs 15 lakh cash in exchange for Rs 10 lakh,” a police source said. “Trusting them, Sangeeta handed over Rs 10 lakh to Krishnaiah. The accused took him to a desolate place near Amrutahalli on October 25 and robbed him at knifepoint.” Based on Krishnaiah’s complaint, the suspects were booked under sections 120B (criminal conspiracy) and 384 (extortion) of IPC. “While the others were traced, it took some time to track down Nataraju. Recently, we managed to nab all of them together,” an investigating officer said. Chittoor police have been alerted about Nataraju’s arrest. At present, all the suspects are in judicial custody. “Chittoor police will take custody of Nataraju after approaching a local court and getting a warrant,” the officer said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/realtor-3-aides-held-for-extortion/articleshow/89212444.cms||---

The visit comes in the backdrop of allegations of prison officials indulging in malpractices and giving preferential treatment to a few inmates for money, said Shashidhar Shetty, member-secretary, Karnataka State Legal Services Authority. Shetty told STOI that Justice Veerappa explained the legal facilities available to prisoners. “He addressed inmates through the prison radio. They were told that cases of those who have spent more than eight years in jail will be taken up on preferential basis. If any inmate is finding it difficult to get legal help, they can approach us for free service,” he said.  A prison official said, “It was a surprise and we did not have prior information (about the visit). The team mainly interacted with inmates and shared details of the legal options available to them. We were told there will be more such visits in the near future to check on allegations of malpractice.” TNN||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/judges-pay-surprise-visit-to-central-jail/articleshow/89212445.cms||---

He was 64. Mohandas Pai, chairman of Manipal Global Education Services and former Infosys top executive, tweeted on Saturday: “Ravi Nedungadi: ‘Money Man’ in Vijay Mallya's Egoscape - Ravi was a very warm, compassionate, brilliant professional, always jovial, helpful and a dear friend. We will miss him dearly, he has left a void in our lives.” He later told STOI that Nedungadi had the “skills and acumen for taxation, auditing, and international finance”. Nedungadi, a chartered accountant from Kerala, joined UB Group’s treasury operations in 1990. He resigned from executive positions in 2016, but continued on the board of United Breweries as Mallya’s nominee till last year. Nedungadi played a central role in raising the funds required for the slew of acquisitions Mallya made in his bid to fend off global players in the alcoholic beverages business. Nedungadi also did the same for Mallya’s eventually disastrous purchase of Air Deccan.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/mallyas-money-man-nedungadi-passes-away/articleshow/89212446.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Deprived of govt ID, contract sanitation workers left in lurch||Bengaluru: Despite having been in service for over 10 years, several contract sanitation workers fear losing out on state-sponsored relief schemes as BWSSB, their principal employer, does not acknowledge that the scope of their work covers ‘public sanitation’. Suresh B, chief engineer, BWSSB, told STOI these workers are only “machine-operating helpers” and therefore cannot be formally recognised by the board.Recently, Karnataka State Safai Karmachari Development Corporation announced a scheme that aims to provide tablets to around 2,000 school/college-going children of pourakarmikas, safai karmacharis and manual scavengers for online classes. Eligible applicants need to upload their official ID on the KSSKDC website. The targeted beneficiaries are strictly meant to be contract/casual/temporary labourers, not permanent ones with government agencies such as BWSSB and BBMP.“It is the Karnataka State Commission for Safai Karmacharis that identifies manual scavengers, not us. Those identified have been given ID cards and they can utilise any scheme rolled out by the government,” Suresh said. The official said it will be technically incorrect to provide ID proof to BWSSB’s contract workers. The water utility defines its permanent sanitation employees as those who “assist the department with sanitation machines”. However, the lived experiences of the 400 member-strong BWSSB Contract Sanitary Workers’ Union are no different from this official definition. Mastan Andhanagera, 37, a contract sanitation worker, has been engaged in the activity for about 14 years. He has three children, two of whom go to secondary school while the other is in class 4. “I manage their online classes using someone else’s phone. A tablet could be of great help.” Babu, a former contract worker employed indirectly with BWSSB for eight years, stopped working 2.5 years ago after fracturing his leg after falling into a septic chamber. “I have two sons, one of whom drives an autorickshaw. The other is in class 9,” Babu said. When asked about BWSSB’s reason to deny them IDs, Mastan said he is a sanitation worker too and has the right to be recognised as one. “Even if there are machines, we operate them using our hands and minds,” he said. As per the National Commission for Safai Karmacharis, any person engaged in, or employed for, manually carrying human excreta or sanitation work should be recognised duly. “We will take this up with SKC and try to find a solution,” KSSKDC managing director KB Mallikarjuna said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/deprived-of-govt-id-contract-sanitation-workers-left-in-lurch/articleshow/89212449.cms||Sanika Athavale
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Tumakuru cop convicted for 2017 rape of specially abled woman||BENGALURU: A 58-year-old assistant sub-inspector from Tumakuru was on Friday convicted by the II additional district sessions court for raping a 30-year-old specially abled woman inside a moving vehicle in January 2017. The order was passed by Justice HS Mallikarjuna Swamy and the quantum of punishment will be announced on Monday. The convicted cop is S Umesh, then ASI with Tumakuru Rural police station and a resident of Gubbi. Personnel from the women’s police station, Tumakuru, arrested him on January 15, 2017 after booking him under IPC section 376(2) (iii) which says, ‘Being a police officer, commits rape on a woman in his custody or in the custody of a police officer subordinate to him’. Umesh is in judicial custody at Tumakuru district prison. Several of his bail pleas were rejected by various courts, including the high court. S Eshwar alias Eshwarappa, 31, of Madhugiri, the driver in whose vehicle Umesh committed the heinous offence, was acquitted due to lack of evidence. Eshwar had claimed he was threatened by Umesh, who said he would frame him in the case. Public prosecutor VA Kavitha said the woman had gone to a temple, around 8km from her house, on the night of January 14 and lost her way after midnight. Since she was specially abled, she could not properly recall the roads leading to her house on the outskirts of Tumakuru. “Hoping to participate in Sankranti celebrations at the temple in the evening, the woman covered the nearly 8km distance on foot. But it was around 11pm when she reached the temple, which was closed. Tired of the long walk, she slept outside the temple and started walking around aimlessly at 2am,” Kavitha said. Met constables off bridgeIt was then that Umesh and four other night-beat constables met her near a bridge on Tumakuru-Madhugiri road. “They realised she was a specially abled woman. When asked, she vaguely told them her address. By then, a jeep driven by Eshwar reached the bridge. Telling his colleagues he would drop her back home, Umesh stopped the vehicle and directed Eshwar to drive,” she said. According to the police chargesheet, Umesh was sitting in the middle seat with the woman. “As the vehicle moved around the outskirts of Tumakuru, Umesh committed the offence. He threatened Eshwar to keep driving if he didn’t want to be framed in the rape case,” the chargesheet read. Finally, Umesh traced her house and the vehicle stopped outside it around 4am. By then, he had called her elder brother on mobile saying they had located his sister near the bridge and were bringing her back. The woman, after repeated attempts, had succeeded in recalling her brother’s number and shared it with Umesh. “As the vehicle stopped, her mother and brother came out of the house. Seeing them, the woman cried loudly and told them that she was raped by ‘police uncle’. Hearing her words, Umesh directed Eshwar to drive away,” Kavitha said. The woman’s family filed a complaint on January 15 with the women’s police station. Umesh was arrested immediately and sent for medical test.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/cop-convicted-for-2017-rape-of-specially-abled-woman/articleshow/89212451.cms||Rajiv Kalkod

The 88-year-old, who attended the Winter Derby on Wednesday, died peacefully at home.A genial man, whose passion for horses is among Indian racing’s folklore, Rashid grew up amongst horses with his grandfather Byramji Rustomji and father Rustomji Byramji both being trainers. A man of many firsts, Byramji earned his trainer's licence in 1955 at the age of 21. In January the following year, the Mumbai-raised youngster won his maiden race, training SA Poonawalla-owned Lingmala to victory. He moved to Bengaluru in 1965.Longevity could well have been his middle name, as he spent 62 years training his wards who went on to win an awe-inspiring number of races with the triumphs crossing 3,200 which included a record 230 classics. Byramji has the unique distinction of having won a record 11 Indian Derbies including two hat-tricks (1976-78 & 1993-95) apart from a dozen Turf Invitation Cups.A man known as much for his ability to spot and nurture champions as for his hard work, Byramji rang down the curtains on his glittering career in 2017. He did so with a deep sense of satisfaction of having saddled champions across the country.Retirement did not mean Byramji stayed away from horses, it meant he spent more time in the stables. Until his last days he was a regular at the Bangalore Turf Club, be it on race days or just to watch the track work.Paying tribute to the stalwart, champion jockey Suraj Narredu said, “The world has lost a gem. To me he was the greatest that will ever be. I have learnt a lot from him. No one will ever be able to match a legend like him. Not only a brilliant trainer but a thorough gentleman in every sense.”Byramji’s son Darius and daughter-in-law Parvati are both trainers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/era-comes-to-an-end-as-byramji-passes-away/articleshow/89212454.cms||---

With the third wave still persisting across the country, the Tamil Nadu middle-order batter has been added as part of a contingency plan along with left-arm spinner and statemate R Sai Kishore.A source confirmed the development Saturday. “The BCCI wants to have all its bases covered. With the third wave still persisting, the Board cannot take a chance and Shahrukh and Sai Kishore have been added to the squad,” a source told TOI.Apart from the duo, TN allrounder Washington Sundar has also been selected for the series which starts in Ahmedabad from February 6.No replacements in TN Ranji squad yet: The trio’s selection will mean that Tamil Nadu might have to seek replacements for their 20-member Ranji Trophy squad. The team management though has not yet asked for Washington’s replacement. “Once the West Indies series would have ended, Washington would have been available. So the management was okay to play the first couple of matches with 19 players. Now the team composition might change with both Shahrukh and Sai out. A final decision will be taken in the next two days,” the source said. Natarajan to undergo fitness test: The postponed Ranji Trophy have also opened the window for Natarajan to be selected in the TN squad. But he will need to pass a fitness test first to be held either on Tuesday or Wednesday. Natarajan has been sidelined for the last two months with a knee injury. TN Ranji camp from Monday: With the postponed Ranji Trophy likely to start from February 12 or 13, the Vijay Shankar-led TN squad will assemble for a week-long camp at the MA Chidambaram Stadium from Monday. The source said that the players will undergo mandatory RT-PCR tests before entering the bubble. Tamil Nadu will probably travel to the destined venue on Feb 6. Chennai likely to host Plate games & knockout round: Chennai is likely to host Plate group matches in the upcoming Ranji Trophy. The BCCI had initially shortlisted Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru, Ahmedabad, Kolkata and Thiruvananthapuram as the likely venues for the tournament. But it was learnt that Mumbai (likely IPL host city) and Thiruvananthapuram (high number of Covid cases) were ruled out. “When the initial phase was planned, Chennai were supposed to host Plate matches. BCCI is likely to stick to the schedule. The knockout phase starts in June and it is the beginning of monsoon in the country. However, Chennai doesn’t get much rain during that phase. So BCCI is likely to schedule the knockout phase in Chennai,” the source said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/shahrukh-sai-among-india-stand-byes/articleshow/89212456.cms||---

In recent times, we have seen Anand play the role and I am sure the team will benefit immensely from his expertise.”The chess event at the Games to be played in two formats will commence on September 11. The individual rapid event will be played from September 11-14.

From 58,311 cases on January 22, the active cases came down to 42,017 on January 28. During the period, the positive rate too has dipped from 25% to 20 %. This means, fewer people are testing positive now for Covid-19, indicating that the spread is waning out. While all the zones are almost uniformly showing a decrease in cases, some of the zones like Adyar are single-handedly contributing 10% of the city’s total active cases, with 4518 positive cases. Four zones i the city — Anna Nagar, Teynampet, Kodambakkam and Perungudi — still have more than 3000 active cases each. Infectious diseases specialist Dr Subramanian Swaminathan said a similar pattern of rise and fall is observed globally and it is no different here. “If the trend continues, by February 15, we may see significantly fewer cases overall,” he said. In Chennai, the ICU occupancy curve remained flat with about 300 to 350 beds being occupied since January 18. “Hospitalisation and mortality trend may show an uptick for a few more days before it falls,” added Dr Swaminathan. While the containment zones in the city also decreased from 490 to 420 during the last week, experts said that focusing on adolescent vaccination and precautionary dose is the way forward. “The routine containment measures will no longer be useful. Fast tracking vaccination of those aged below 15 is needed,” said Dr Swaminathan. The future course of containing the virus will be only through vaccination. “The relaxations could be accelerated as the omicron cases are tapering. The Covid-19 pandemic would reach an endemic stage if we keep on vaccinating people,” said virologist Dr Jacob John. “I don’t see a new delta variant coming again soon. Booster dose coverage must be fast tracked for the eligible population,” he added. Corporation commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi said even though the cases were decreasing, the civic body was not lowering its guard. “We will keep engaging Covid-19 volunteers till February 15. The screening centres too will continue till cases reduce further,” he told TOI. Former director of public health Dr K Kolandaswamy said the field volunteers could be retained for vector-control diseases as well. "The city, apart from Covid-19, has endemic infections like dengue and malaria, which require additional manforce. The corporation must interchange the field staff for control measures of other diseases," he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/active-covid-19-cases-down-by-16k-in-city-since-last-week/articleshow/89212462.cms||Omjasvin M D

In an incident at Puzhal, a 32-year-old man was arrested on Saturday for sexually abusing a 16-year-old girl. Suban Batcha, who was employed as a service staff at a washing machine unit in the city, had befriended a woman when he visited her house to repair a faulty washing machine. Later, he developed an illicit relationship with the woman and continued to stay at her house as her husband was sick and ailing. Batcha then made sexual advances to the woman’s 16-year-old daughter. The issue came to light after Batcha forwarded obscene video clips to her school WhatsApp group. The school authorities informed the child helpline about the incident. The Puzhal all-women police arrested Batcha. In another incident at Thiruvottiyur, Ragava Raja, 27, of Navalur, was arrested for sexually assaulting a 16-year-old girl. He spiked her drinks and took obscene video of her and continued to abuse her. Due to this, the girl became pregnant.

---||Chennai||New parameters to grade nearly 41,825 Tamil Nadu temples||CHENNAI: Temples maintained by the Hindu religious and charitable endowments department will now be measured not only on the basis of income, but on location, age, history, agama, inscriptions, heritage and architectural aspects among others. About 20 retired archaeological experts have been roped in to grade 41,825 temples. While the move will help renovate several dilapidated heritage temples, it will also enable the department to improve infrastructure and facilities in other temples to get them on the spiritual tourism map. It will also pave the way for study of inscriptions and manuscripts. Former officials of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) and state archaeology department will grade temples in 20 regions based on location, age, history, agama, method of worship, material used for construction, whether sung by saints, unique and literary features, availability of inscriptions, heritage and architectural aspects, method of worship. They will also execute documentation and conditional mapping of dilapidated temples to prepare a detailed project report for conservation and maintenance. The advisors will also help preserve antique idols and registration of relics with ASI. The registration is essential to prevent the smuggling of artefacts and their retrieval from abroad. So far, temples have been graded only based on income. Of the 41,825 temples maintained by the HR and CE department, at least 8,000 are heritage structures that are more than 100 years old. HR and CE commissioner J Kumaragurubaran said it was for time that archaeological experts are part of the conservation wing. “So far, the 100 employees were all technical and construction experts.” C Santhalingam, former archaeology officer in the state archaeology department now made advisor for Madurai region, said inscriptions would be studied to ascertain the age temples. “We will also suggest what type of modern material that should not be used in heritage structures such as ceramic tiles on the floors.” V K T Balan, president of Tamil Nadu Tour Travel and Hospitality Association, said 75% of all domestic and international tourists visiting TN came for spiritual tourism. “TN must include historical temples, those with archaeological relevance and customs in places of worship in the district tourist circuit.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/new-parameters-to-grade-nearly-41825-tn-temples/articleshow/89212467.cms||Yogesh Kabirdoss
---||Chennai||Chennai: Footfall in standalone restaurants, bars set to go up as Covid curbs lifted||CHENNAI: Standalone restaurants and bars in the city and its suburbs, which lost about 35% of footfalls when the night curfew and Sunday lockdown were in force, are expected to see improved business as restrictions have been lifted. Pubs wooing customers with ‘happy hour’ deals, offering free alcoholic beverages during the day, have withdrawn them as more customers are expected to troop in.  The restrictions over the past fortnight were the third blow for the hospitality sector that had suffered permanent closure of about 1,500 restaurants of different seating capacities due to poor patronage, maintenance and rent since March 2020.  At night, when most restaurants record about 40% of their total business, only a fraction walked in tor dine during the past fortnight. Empty seats in eateries did not translate into online orders that continued to be in the range of 20%, according to the restaurateurs association. Standalone restaurants, pubs and bars were allow only 50% of their total seating capacity as per the standard operating procedure (SOP).  R Rajkumar, proprietor of an eatery at Kolathur, said seats were vacant when there should have been a surge in footfalls after 7pm. The menu was also trimmed thanks to poor patronage. “Sales decreased substantially,” said Rajkumar, who has shut two branches at Parry’s and Perambur post Covid-19. About 8,500 eateries and restaurants had been operating within a radius of 30km in Chennai, while the core city has 174 standalone bars, pubs, resto-bars, and bars attached to hotels. M Ravi, president of The Chennai Hotels Association, said anywhere between 40% and 45% of customers did not turn up since fresh curbs came into effect this month. “We cut down on our purchase on vegetables and other ingredients by 30%,” he added. Arasu Dennis, director of AD Associates that is a bar and restaurant consultant in Chennai, said business and footfalls took a heavy toll from 30%-50%. “In a bid to woo customers, pubs and standalone bars had begun offering ‘buy one get one free’ and ‘buy two and get one free’ on alcoholic drinks and brunches on Saturday in the past three weeks. We have withdrawn ‘happy hour’ deals as people have started visiting the facilities again,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/footfall-in-standalone-restaurants-bars-set-to-go-up-as-covid-curbs-lifted/articleshow/89212469.cms||---

Air India used to fly from Chennai to Sydney, Kuala Lumpur, Singapore and Paris. The airline continues to hold its traditional slots at Chennai airport. There is potential to double the daily flights to Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok, Hong Kong and to a few destinations in Europe. The airline had stopped flying most of the domestic and international routes in the past 10 years. But the slots used by the airline are available, said an airport official. As hopes are high, travel and tour operators’ associations – Travel Agents Association of India (TAAI) and Travel Agents Federation of India (TAFI) have urged the new management to resume more flights from the city. At present, Air India Express operates ‘air bubble’ flights. The TAAI in its message said the efficiency of the new management will help Air India “to exploit operating assets like lucrative routes to southeast Asia, Latin America and Australia. With simple improvements in consistency of service, Air India’s bilaterals are goldmines.” The airline could use its slots available in congested foreign airports like London and New York, said TAAI national managing committee member P Murugesan. Bhaskar, national committee member, TAFI, said travellers could have better options. “Hong Kong, Jakarta, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur flights have good demand. Business travellers will have a good option if flights to Europe are resumed.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/tour-operators-urge-tatas-to-make-chennai-se-hub/articleshow/89212472.cms||---

Light to moderate rain has also been forecast over other parts of the state, including Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Nagapattinam, Mayiladuthurai, Pudukottai districts and south Tamil Nadu on Sunday. While the incoming warm and moisture-laden easterly winds from the Bay of Bengal is leading to overcast skies and occasional rain, an IMD official said, “This is due to the cyclonic circulation in the upper atmosphere over Gulf of Mannar and adjoining areas.” The easterlies are leading to formation of clouds. This has led to day temperatures touching near normal at 29.8 deg C and 30.2 deg C in Nungambakkam and Meenambakkam on Saturday while the night temperatures shot up to 24.6 deg C and 24.4 deg C respectively. IMD has forecast dry weather to prevail over the state from January 31 to February 2. Skymet chief meteorologist Mahesh Palawat said the easterlies are present as the western disturbance is absent in the north, but wind directions may change next week. A western disturbance in the north could lead to entry of cool in-land winds over Tamil Nadu. “We can expect temperatures to go down by two to three degrees around February 1,” he said. Blogger Pradeep John said while the nippy weather may last till February 5, models show that night temperatures may even touch 18 deg C in the suburbs. “Easterlies may return after February 5 and there may be slight rise in night temperatures. Models are also showing some rains in the coastal areas in mid-February,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/cold-nights-to-return-from-feb-1/articleshow/89212484.cms||---

The party mouthpiece Murasoli, in an article carried with a pen name, sought to remind Ravi, “This is not Nagaland, but Tamil Nadu,” in an apparent reference to Ravi’s earlier stint as governor of Nagaland, which had attracted opposition criticism. In his customary message on the eve of the Republic Day, Ravi said improving the quality of education in government schools was the need of the time. Before the introduction of NEET, the share of students from government schools getting medical seats in government colleges was hardly 1%. “Thanks to the affirmative action of 7.5% reservation for government school students, that number has improved significantly, however, there is an urgent need to improve the quality of education also in government schools,” Ravi said. He also said depriving students of knowledge of other Indian languages was unfair to all. The ruling DMK, which was upset with Ravi for delaying his decision on the Bill seeking exemption for Tamil Nadu from NEET — passed in the assembly in September, has not taken lightly to Ravi’s remarks on NEET. It is incensed over the inference in Ravi’s message that the previous AIADMK government provided 7.5% reservation to government school students in medical admission. The article attacking Ravi read, “Intimidating tactics is perhaps needed for the police department (Ravi is a retired IPS officer); it will be helpful on many occasions, but he should realize that it will not help achieve anything in politics”. It charged the governor with transgressing his Constitutional role by supporting NEET when “the whole state, barring a few Sanghis” was opposing the common entrance test. People in Tamil Nadu, unlike other states, are politically conscious even if they live in remote villages. It would do good for the governor to understand the state and its history before making unsavoury comments that bring disrepute to his position, the article said. Taking a leaf from a folklore, it added, “Kokkendru ninaithayo, Konganava” (Recalling the story of sage Konganavar, who killed a stork, the article asked Ravi whether he thinks it [read DMK government] is a stork). The governor should explain to the people whether it is fair to take refuge under legal cover and sit on the Bill, dashing the wishes of seven crore people and insulting them, it said. The article also had a word of advice to Ravi about his role as the Union government’s representative. His duty was to inform the Centre about the sentiments of the people and not push the Union government’s agenda down their throats, it said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/dmk-mouthpiece-lashes-out-at-guv-for-pro-neet-message/articleshow/89212486.cms||---

It was also informed that around 1.33 lakh government officers and personnel will be employed as election officers, booth level officers, and polling station officers and in charge along with 80 thousand police personnel, the petitioner said.As large-scale irregularities are reported in every election in counting postal votes, I made a representation to the SEC on January 27 to appoint election officers from different jurisdictions more particularly from the rural areas so as to ensure fairness in the conduct of election and curb the scope for any malpractice, he said. The plea moved as a PIL is likely to be taken up for hearing on January 31.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/sec-can-engage-rural-officials-ex-mla-in-hc/articleshow/89212487.cms||---

The municipal administration department has issued a GO sanctioning Rs 545 crore to the Hyderabad Road Development Corporation Limited (HRDCL) for building the bridges. The new bridges have been necessitated as some of the existing ones constructed a few decades ago, such as at Moosarambagh, are not able to take the traffic load and at many places there is a need to have more bridges for better connectivity which will also reduce traffic on main roads."Keeping in view the growing population and need for a better road network, a detailed traffic study was done to assess locations where additional bridges should be constructed across Musi river. Based on the traffic study and also with a view to strengthen some of the existing bridges, 15 bridges have been proposed," municipal administration department special chief secretary Arvind Kumar said in the GO. Officials said municipal minister KT Rama Rao was keen on decongesting the main roads and also develop link roads in the city. He has been focussing on Musi rejuvenation project. If the bridges are constructed and Musi riverfront project is completed, the areas abutting the Musi are expected to witness huge development and property values are expected to rise. Some bridges are required at locations witnessing huge development such as high-level bridge at Budvel (IT Park) and connecting road parallel to Esa river, a new link road to Manchireveula village, from Manchirevula village to Narsingi village on Musi and Uppal Bhagat layout to South Bank of Musi. "At some places such as Chaderghat and Moosarambagh, the existing bridges are low and get flooded during heavy rains. While at a few places the government has proposed bridges parallel to the existing once like in Attapur," a senior official said. A few months ago, the HRDCL had invited applications on designs and had received 30 plans. One of the designs has reportedly been selected which will be used for all the bridges. "The bridges will have a heritage look and an iconic pedestrian bridge is planned at Afzalgunj," an official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/15-bridges-to-come-on-musi-and-esa-rivers-to-ease-traffic-in-city/articleshow/89212491.cms||Koride Mahesh

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Loco pilots blow horn, face attacks; 6 injured||AHMEDABAD: For many of us, the sound of a train whistle triggers memories of childhood journeys – fighting with siblings for the window seat, pleading with parents to buy you that snack, straining to read the names of stations, and making ghost sounds while passing through tunnels. But for some, the high-pitched horn triggers so much irritation that they end up pelting stones at the locomotive. In the past six months, six such attacks have taken place on railway lines in Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar, leaving at least three loco pilots with severe injuries that needed multiple surgeries. On Friday night, the pilot of an express train spotted two men sleeping near the railway tracks and blew the whistle to wake them up so that they would not be crushed under the wheels. Unhappy to be woken up in this manner, they threw stones at the engine, damaging it. Fortunately, driver, Chandan Kumar, did not suffer any injuries. However, there are others who were not as fortunate as Kumar. According to sources in the western railway, railway protection force (RPF) and Gujarat railway police (GRP), such attacks have been on the rise in the past few months with pilots suffering serious injuries. "In three incidents, the loco pilots suffered permanent injuries to their eyes. One of them has lost vision in one eye while the other two are undergoing surgeries and treatment. The attacks also cause damage to the engines," said an official of the western railway. Around six months ago, Nilesh Dhanu -- the locomotive pilot of Porbandar-Kochuveli Express -- suffered critical injury in his left eye when someone threw stones at him near Ghodasar Bridge. "He was immediately rushed to LG hospital where he has been operated thrice but still he cannot see from the injured eye," said a source in the railways. In a similar incident, the loco pilot of a goods train, Kishor Solanki, lost vision in one of his eyes in an attack that took place near Ambli junction around two months ago. Sunil Kumar, the loco pilot of a train between Mumbai and Ahmedabad, had to face a similar attack between Nadiad and Memdavad about a month ago. Apart from this, the locomotive pilot of a Demu train was attacked near Naroda. Some pelted stones at the train, shattering glass that pierced his body in several places, states railway records. In December, there were two incidents of stone pelting on the Valsad-Viramgam passenger train near Sabarmati. RPF and GRP officers probing the case said that people, who are caught in these cases, confess that they pelted stones after getting irritated by the train whistle. Joint divisional secretary in the Western railways employees' union and director of JC bank of the railways, Sanjay Suryabali, confirmed the incidents. He said, "People need to understand that a pilot blows the whistle to save people's lives."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/loco-pilots-blow-horn-face-attacks/articleshow/89212507.cms||Ashish Chauhan
---||Hyderabad||Covid chief culprit in violence wave||HYDERABAD: The ongoing pandemic and resultant restrictions on movement of people has led to an increase in incidents of self-harm and violence. It was more pronounced during the first two lockdowns imposed soon after the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared Covid-19 as a pandemic. A multi-city study, which included researchers from Hyderabad, revealed that there was increase in self-harm and violence by 12.71% among men and 95.32% among women per 1,000 emergency hospital admissions during the pandemic as compared to the pre-pandemic period. The study also saw an increase in violence by known individuals and between the partners. In the self-harm dataset an increase in mortality, ICU admissions and decision to leave against medical advice was found, the study said adding that increase in the use of alcohol prior to acts of self harm and violence was noted during the two lockdown periods. The study was published in the latest issue of the scientific journal, American Journal of Emergency Medicine. The research team comprised Suhrith Bhattarama, Varsha S Shinde, Ishan Lamba, Rebecca S Gladwin and Kadainti Venkata Subbaraya Sharma. As part of the research, the team studied 828 patients. Of them, 30% were women while 70% were men. There was a significant correlation between the Covid-19 lockdown and the increased incidence of violence and self harm. “An increase in violence by known individuals and between partners was witnessed. Intimate partner violence also increased to 7%. Periods of pandemics and quarantine often lead to an increase of psychological distress, depression, self harm, suicidal ideation and violence. The ‘stay-at-home’ policy, while effective in curbing the spread of the disease, has also contributed to an increment in the stress levels, intra-family disputes and intimate-partner violence,” the researchers said. According to the study, during the research period a total of 20,892 patients presented to the emergency department with 12,238 patients during the first lockdown and 8,654 during the second lockdown. Of these cases, 864 patients were studied. During the lockdown periods there was an increase in emergency admissions by 3,584 patients, which is 41.4% increase when compared with that of the pre-pandemic period.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/covid-chief-culprit-in-violence-wave/articleshow/89212509.cms||Syed Akbar

With the number of hospitalisations seeing surge across the city, doctors are again back to using remdesivir for Covid-19 treatment of patients, who are severely ill. During the second wave of the pandemic, remdesivir was extensively used for Covid-19 treatment with people scrambling to get their hands on the drug. However, in April 2021, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) issued guidelines to stop irrational use and over prescription of the emergency drug. Now, with more number of patients getting admitted in hospitals and ICU beds getting filled, doctors are using remdesivir for those who are suffering from persisting symptoms such as high fever and cough for more than five days. “Most of the patients with decreased saturation levels of below 95%, high fever, pneumonia patches in CT scan are affected by the Delta variant. In such cases, remdesivir is required for five to seven days, depending on the condition of the patient. Whereas, in Omicron, hardly three days of remdesivir is required,” said Dr Gopi Krishna Yedlapati, consultant interventional pulmonologist at Yashoda Hospitals, Secunderabad. As per ICMR guidelines, the off label medicine can be used in emergencies with moderate to severe disease on someone who are within 10 days of onset of symptoms. “There are not many medications in our hand to treat severely ill Covid-19 patients. We initiate remdivisir on hypoxic patients. Depending on their inflammatory marks, we also initiate steroids and then taper the doses as per the patient condition,” said Dr K Prashanth Kumar, consultant physician, Sunshine Hospitals. Although the ICMR has recommended the drug only for emergency use, some hospitals in the city are going by the US government’s Food and Drug Administration’s recent research where it has expanded the usage of remdesivir even for non-hospitalised adults and children aged 12 years and older weighing at least 40 kgs, with the rise in Covid infections.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/docs-back-to-remdesivir-as-hospitalisations-rise/articleshow/89212512.cms||Preeti Biswas

In many cases, requests are being made by people post recovery. “My father required O+ plasma. He had recovered from Covid-19 almost two months ago. After raising the request on social media, I got the required plasma and it was given to him,” said Nitish K, who was contacted by TOI regarding his request dated January 24. Last month, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially recommended against the use of convalescent plasma therapy, citing high uncertainty of outcome. Even the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) removed the use of plasma therapy from its clinical management guidelines for Covid-19 last year. Following this, doctors said that the therapy, once hailed as a potential line of treatment for Covid-19, is not as effective. “Since the second wave, the Covid-19 virus has mutated a lot. We don’t even know how many antibodies are present in plasma and how effective it is against existing Covid-19 variants. People should abide by ICMR guidelines in such circumstances to avoid health consequences,” said Dr Arra Raghukanth, senior consultant pulmonologist at Medicover Hospitals.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/not-on-treatment-list-but-plasma-requests-still-persist/articleshow/89212513.cms||---

Considering the last week in December to be the start of the third wave in the state, 74,423 people were infected (until Friday), with an overall positivity rate of 3.12% on an average. Interestingly, this is less than the caseload and positivity rate during the peak of the second wave between April 15 and May 15 last year. Telangana reported 1.82 lakh cases during that period, with an overall positivity rate of about 7%. The daily peak caseload in the state had reached more than 11,000 cases. According to experts, reporting of cases this time is low and the actual caseload during the third wave is six times higher because only the symptomatic are being tested. There is also an increased tendency for self-testing, with only 50% of antigen testing yielding true positive results. Dr BR Shamanna of the University of Hyderabad’s School of Medical Sciences said, “There is a lot of self-testing. For every identified positive person, there would be six missing positive cases. In fact, during the fever survey, the state government distributed more than three lakh isolation kits to people, those numbers are also indicative of possible caseload if they were tested.” From the last week of December to the last Friday, the state conducted over 23 lakh tests. The GHMC added 33,977 cases in the same period, accounting for nearly half of the state’s caseload. “There is no need to panic. People are being cautious and approaching healthcare system when needed. With festivities largely over, and cases still not as high, this wave can pass off smoothly,” said Dr Subodh Kandmuthan, director of the Dr Kakrala Subbaro Centre for Health Care Management, Administrative Staff College of India (ASCI).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/with-many-not-testing-t-daily-tally-less-than-in-second-wave/articleshow/89212515.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Doctors have also warned that the therapy is of no use for those having mild symptoms and infected with Omicron. “People with mild symptoms are recovering with symptomatic medicines and do not require the monoclonal therapy. Instead, the therapy is mostly sought by those who are at high risk and have chronic medical conditions,” said K Shankar, superintendent of Fever Hospital.

It is time they do. This was stated by Nobel laureate Abhijit Banerjee while discussing his recently launched cookbook, ‘Cooking to save your life’ at the Hyderabad Literature Festival on Saturday. Banerjee was joined by the book’s illustrator, Cheyenne Olivier, in an online discussion.“I think pleasure should be more central in the way we think about economics,” Banerjee, who received the Nobel in 2019 for his contribution to research in poverty alleviation, said. “For me, a one-course meal is not satisfying. There must be multiple courses. There needs to be progression to a meal.” He made the comment while answering a question on how an economist on poverty ended up writing a book on the richness of food.Explaining the importance of pleasure, he said, “There are many myths about the consumption habits of the poor. Because they have financial constraints, they eat only those foods which are nutritious and affordable. Anyone who has worked closely with the poor knows that this is not true. The poor understand that pleasure makes life liveable. You will go to a mela and buy a pakoda for the excitement even if you have limited resources. Everybody needs pleasure.”He pooh-poohed the idea that it is unusual for a Nobel prize-winning economist to spend so much time in the kitchen that he ends up writing a cookbook.“Nobel laureates too have to eat, and perhaps more than others,” he added. “Two hours spent cooking is two hours lost to economics is nonsense. You could be spending those same two hours doing other things like talking to people or just staring at your notes and not doing anything.”At the same time, he said that his cookbook is not totally devoid of economics as both cooking and economics deal with getting the most out of existing resources.Briefly touching on the controversies around meat-eating in India he said he has discussed vegetarianism and meat-earing issues in the book.“In Ahmedabad, the government tried to ban non-vegetarian food recently, but even in the BJP there is a divide on the issue. If I don’t like the smell of what you cook, it will become an issue. In the UK, many landlords don’t give homes to Indians because they cook up a storm. They can have a barbeque but not Indian spices. I have tried to give a framework to discuss these issues,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/economists-dont-study-pleasure-enough-nobel-laureate-abhijit/articleshow/89212520.cms||---

Education minister P Sabitha Indra Reddy has said that all the educational institutions in the state should function by strictly adhering to Covid-19 protocols. This announcement came a day after the Telangana high court questioned the state government’s logic behind reopening schools while keeping the colleges shut. The court had also asked the government to furnish a report by February 3 on the issue. The minister said: “The health department has suggested that all the educational institutions can be reopened by complying with Covid-19 guidelines.” The health department had submitted a report to the government saying that Covid-19 positivity rate was under control. ‘77 lakh people covered under fever survey’School managements, teachers and parents should take appropriate Covid-19 safety measures, Sabitha Indra Reddy said. The educational institutions and parents will have to take all measures to prevent the virus from spreading, senior officials said. Education department secretary Sandeep Kumar Sultania issued a memo permitting reopening of all educational institutions from Tuesday. Director of public health Dr G Srinivasa Rao had informed the high court that the positivity rate in the state stood at 3.17 per cent and that as many as 77 lakh people were covered under the fever survey being carried out across the state.

The company supplied 103 e-buses during Q3FY22 as against 13 e-buses in Q3FY21. Commenting on the performance, OGL chairman & managing director KV Pradeep said: “We are getting ready to begin the construction of a state-of-the-art EV manufacturing plant in Hyderabad. Deliveries are picking up and we are confident of meeting the demand.” The company currently has an order book of 1,523 electric buses. The company’s e-bus division recorded revenues of Rs 186 crore for the quarter as against Rs 28.7 crore in the corresponding quarter of 2020-21, providing a boost to the topline.On the other hand, the insulator division recorded lower revenues of Rs 21 crore in Q3FY22 as against Rs 31 crore in Q3FY21 mainly due to lower offtake from customers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/ogl-clocks-3-fold-jump-in-q3-net-profit/articleshow/89212527.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: 7 held in businessman murder case||HYDERABAD: In connection with the brutal murder of a real estate businessman, where the victim’s head and torso were drowned in different water bodies around Sanga Reddy district, seven persons were arrested by district police on Saturday. It was hired assailants who killed the victim. Police said that the motive of the murder turned out to be victim’s alleged illicit relationship with the accused wives beside financial disputes. BDL Bhanur police said that 35-year-old K Raju went missing on Tuesday. Since he was not seen, his brother K Gopal lodged a police complaint on Wednesday. Police, by verifying the call data records of the victim, traced the persons whom he last spoke to. When the suspects were interrogated, police came to know that Raju was murdered. Police found the role of Pallapu Ramesh, N Vishnu and Madhu beside the relatives of the victim - Kadavath Ram Singh, Kadavath Venkatesh, Kadavath Mallesh, Wadithya Balu Naik, Kadavath Jayapal, Shankar- in the murder conspiracy. “The victim is into real estate and made good money. He dominated others in the village and developed illicit relationships with many women including the wives of a few accused. The relatives, who are accused in this case, have engaged Ramesh, Vishnu and Madhu to kill Raju, as they bore grudge against the victim,” police said. Some had differences with him over distribution of money received from a pharma firm. Madhu, by posing as a buyer of the land, laid the trap. The hired assailants along with Kadavath Ram Singh met the victim at a real estate venture and later they consumed liquor. The victim was attacked with a knife and axe.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/7-held-in-bizman-murder-case/articleshow/89212529.cms||---

The project will be taken up a cost of Rs 703 crore. Excise and tourism minister V Srinivas Goud, a few months ago, had requested Union minister Nitin Gadkari to finalise the tenders for the national highway project at the earliest. CM KCR during his meeting with Gadkari had also sought the Centre to grant technical and administrative clearance for the project. “This is going to boost development of Mahbubnagar apart from improving connectivity from Karnataka,” Goud said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/centre-clears-703-cr-t-ktaka-road-project/articleshow/89212530.cms||---

Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao had on Friday directed the Telangana police and R&B officials to ensure that the building is ready by February 15. “The technical committee members inspected and shortlisted the furniture needed for the building and its various offices and chambers. All the Project Management Unit (PMU) team members have been briefed to look into all pending issues and ensure the building work is completed by the set deadline, that is, February 15,” Hyderabad police said. Meanwhile, the officials are in the process of identifying the different wings of Hyderabad police which have to be shifted to the new building. The Central Crime Station (CCS) along with the cyber crime wing are also expected to be moved from the existing office at Old Traffic Complex near assembly to the new building in Banjara Hills. It is not sure if the traffic wing will also be shifted to the new building. The construction of the building had begun in 2016 and the project cost has now escalated to nearly 600 crore. When the project was first proposed, the estimated cost was 300 crore, but due to various factors, especially the inclusion of different additional requirements including parking, the cost has escalated.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/cp-holds-meet-to-speed-up-control-centre-work/articleshow/89212532.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Love, sex and films drove searches online last year||HYDERABAD: Search trend analysis on Google has revealed that people in Telangana looked up for love, sex and gold a lot in the second year of the pandemic. While across the country, people searched ‘sexy’ (in Hindi), netizens in Telangana looked up for ‘sex’ (in Telugu) in 2021, enough to take both words in the list of top Google searches. ‘Love’ also featured in Telangana’s top list. However, pirated websites trumped all of the above searches. People in Telangana searched for film piracy websites for Tollywood releases. Most new Tollywood movies were leaked on these sites, which are popular in other parts of the country too. “Piracy is a criminal offence and causes huge loss to the film industry. Small and medium budget films are the worst hit. Police and agencies concerned must keep it in check,” Tollywood film director N Shankar told TOI. Trends indicate that in Telangana, like the rest of India, there is a large consumption of video content. Another top search in Telangana, rather unsurprisingly, was ‘gold rate today’. While the country searched for ‘satta’ (gambling) to try and make some quick money, netizens in Telangana typed ‘matka’ in the search window a lot. ‘CoWin app’ and ‘Covid-19 vaccine’ were also the top queries from Telangana. Many in Telangana and across the country also looked for ‘cricket’. Top searches are terms that are most frequently searched within the chosen region. Social media platforms were also popular searches.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/love-sex-and-films-drove-searches-online-last-year/articleshow/89212533.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

Cops got custody of Tony on Saturday afternoon from Nampally court. He will be in police custody till February 2. Tony was brought to Punjagutta police station in a PPE kit. On the first day, police quizzed him about payments made by customers buying cocaine from him. Sources said in most cases Tony was paid in cash by his clients. Police have evidence of some online payments by customers, but they are yet to corroborate it with banks. Seven out of the 13 identified customers of Tony in city have also been arrested. Police said that customers knew little about those who actually delivered the contraband as Tony frequently changed his drug couriers to maintain secrecy.Most of Tony’s agents are reportedly located in Mumbai from where he operated his drug distribution network. A fresh visit by city cops to Mumbai has been delayed due to the pandemic as many policemen who earlier went to the western megapolis are now down with Covid-19.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/cops-get-tonys-custody-quiz-him-on-payments/articleshow/89212535.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Insurance policies of Koneru & sons attached by ED||HYDERABAD: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has attached the insurance policies taken in the names of Koneru Rajendra Prasad, an accused in the Emaar case, and his sons Pradeep and Madhu. The policies from a foreign insurance company are about to mature. Contending that quashing of the case against an accused cannot prevent the statutory authorities from attaching the crime assets in possession of such persons, the ED also issued a fresh summons asking Koneru Madhu to appear before them. He has now been asked to explain his case regarding the huge premiums paid for the insurance policies. According to ED, Madhu paid the insurance premium for five insurance policies with proceeds of crime related to the Emaar scam. It can be recalled that Koneru Madhu was earlier made an accused in the CBI as well as ED cases filed in the Emaar-APIIC case. Madhu’s father Koneru Rajendra Prasad is one of the main accused in the CBI and ED cases. But the high court through two separate judgments later quashed the CBI and ED cases against Madhu on the ground that the probe agencies could not make out a valid case against him. However, in November 2021, the ED issued fresh summons to Madhu over the insurance policies. Madhu challenged these actions before the high court. In an interim order, the high court stayed the action of the ED and sought a detailed counter from the authorities. Though the stay expired a few days ago, the matter may come up for hearing next week.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/insurance-policiesof-koneru-sonsattached-by-ed/articleshow/89212537.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

According to Uppal police, S Ramesh, a native of Warangal, was sharing his room with another man. On Friday morning, Ramesh’s roommate had gone out and after he returned home in the evening, he found the room door locked from inside and there was no response from Ramesh. Later, the house owner and Ramesh’s roommate opened the door by force and found Ramesh hanging. No suicide note was found. Ramesh took online classes through different educational apps. “Ramesh had taken 6000 loan from an instant loan app. But so far, there is no information of any harassment. We do not know if it has any link to his death. We are still probing this angle,” Uppal police said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/24-year-old-tutor-ends-life-in-uppal/articleshow/89212538.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||New diktat to curb drugs: Hyderabad pubs can’t play music!||HYDERABAD: Pubs and clubs in Hyderabad will not play music any more. And they will definitely not have live shows or DJ nights, thanks to a verbal diktat issued by the excise department at a hurriedly held meeting with industry representatives on Saturday. Reasons: Noise pollution and rising drug abuse in the city. Noise pollution, one can understand given that some of the pubs are in residential areas. But what has the drug trade got to do with music? Many pub owners wondered if Hyderabad will become drug-free if their watering holes hit the silent button. Shocked by the new directive an industry executive said, “We have been warned of strict punishment – temporary shutdown of 10 days or even cancellation of license – in case the rule is violated. How can the industry survive like this? We would appreciate if the government reconsidered this move.” Excise minister V Srinivas Goud confirmed the new unwritten rule, but insisted it was being brought in primarily to curb “noise pollution”, especially in Jubilee Hills where residents have filed multiple complaints – even with the high court – on the issue. The minister, however, hinted that the rule helped in arresting drug abuse by “youngsters”. “All these parties that happen disturb people living around clubs and pubs. They also become places for students and young people to indulge in different things. These places can have some soft background music like in restaurants,” he said. Repeated attempts to reach Sarfaraz Ahmad, commissioner of prohibition and excise, proved unsuccessful. “Every weekend we spend Rs 3 lakh to Rs 3.5 lakh to get artistes for live shows. That is our USP. If we are not allowed to hold these events, how will we meet our expenses? So many people will be out of work. This move will cause tremendous harm to the industry that is finally getting back on its feet after the lockdown and the impact of the pandemic” said another club owner, adding, “We are ready to support the government in every way to curb drug abuse, but disallowing us from playing music cannot be the solution.” Members of the industry said that they were trying to get an audience with senior government officials to discuss the issue further and ensure they can work out a solution that is ‘beneficial’ to everyone.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/new-diktat-to-curb-drugs-hyd-pubs-cant-play-music/articleshow/89212397.cms||Sudipta Sengupta

The TPCC president visited Mahabubabad and met the families of those who died by suicide waiting for job notifications or owing to recent teachers transfers. He also met families of farmers who had died of heart attack due to heavy losses owing to crop failure. Revanth met families of a government teacher, a jobless youngster and Dalit and Girijan farmers. He visited the family members of Jaitram Naik, a government school teacher, who died of a heart attack following his transfer to another district under GO 317. Jaitram was working in his native Chinnamupparam village of Nellikudur mandal in Mahabubabad. He was depressed after he was transferred to Mulugu. The authorities did not stop his transfer even on medical grounds as he had suffered a paralytic attack. The TPCC chief blamed both TRS and BJP governments for the controversial GO 317 which, he said, had claimed the lives of teachers and employees in the last one month. He said that the new zonal system was approved by the BJP government at the Centre and KCR government in the state later issued GO 317. Revanth said Muthyala Sagar of Bayyaram took his life by jumping in front of a train near Khammam station on January 25 over delay in release of job notifications.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/trs-bjp-responsible-for-go-317-deaths-revanth/articleshow/89212542.cms||---

The SFIO on Friday requested the SC for an urgent hearing on its appeal against a Delhi HC order stalling probe into the alleged collection of Rs 50,000 crore from investors by three Sahara Group companies and the alleged involvement of six other group entities in round-tripping and siphoning-off public money. “The allegations of siphoning of Rs 50,000 crore are incorrect and contrary to evidence available on record. When we have repaid the entire amount (liability) then where is the question of round tripping and siphoning off public money?”Sahara India said in a statement.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sfios-allegation-of-siphoning-of-rs-50000-crore-incorrect-says-sahara/articleshow/89212543.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana likely to hike its welfare dole in this year’s budget by Rs 30,000 crore||HYDERABAD: With the assembly elections slated for next year, the state government is set to focus its attention on welfare schemes and subsidies. Sources said budget allocations for welfare schemes are likely to see a quantum leap by at least another Rs 30,000 crore in the 2022-23 state budget. The state government is already spending Rs 58,000 crore annually on various welfare schemes and subsidies. Following allocation of another Rs 30,000 crore, Telangana will emerge as the only state in the country to spend about Rs 90,000 crore on welfare schemes and subsidies, sources said. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao and industry minister KT Rama Rao have often claimed that Telangana is the only state implementing various schemes by allocating huge funds in the budget. The government is all set to enhance allocations for schemes like Dalit Bandhu and introduce new schemes. The government is also seized of a possible rise in the number of beneficiaries for pensions following the reduction of age from 60 to 57, sources said. The budget will be presented in the assembly next month. While various departments have begun the exercise on budgetary proposals, the government is yet to finalise the dates on the budget session.  In the next seven years, government wants to cover 17 lakh Dalit families in the state. In the current year’s budget, government had allocated only Rs 1,000 crore under CM’s Dalit empowerment programme. Another major programme on government’s radar is second phase of sheep distribution programme. Though it was announced a few months ago, the second phase is yet to be kicked off. Official sources said that about Rs 6,000 crore would be spent in the coming financial year. Assembly polls are due around end of 2023 but political parties are predicting that KCR may advance elections. Government is likely to announce the much-awaited unemployment allowance Rs 3,016 a month to jobless youth. Sources said CM has already got preliminary work done for implementing the scheme, which would be rolled out for unemployed graduates. In its 2018 manifesto, TRS promised to provide unemployment allowance.  “In 2021-22 budget, government allocated Rs 11,728 crore for Aasara pensions. With age limit for pensioners reduced and new applications set to go up, budget allocation is expected to go up to Rs 15,000 crore a year,” a senior official of finance department said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/t-likely-to-hike-its-welfare-dole-in-this-yrs-budget-by-30k-cr/articleshow/89212544.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: With 65,000 seeds, Sircilla girl sets out on path to plant a green future||HYDERABAD: On January 31, Blessy will celebrate her eighth birthday with a difference. She will go along with her father into a nearby forest and sprinkle seed balls for a greener tomorrow. What Dobbala Blessy from Suddala village in Sircilla’s Konaraopet mandal has created is a seed bank with 65,000 seeds. On Saturday, Blessy sat down to make preparations for her birthday. She made seed balls with mud and kept them ready. On her birthday, she will go along with her father Prakruthi Prakash into the forest area and disperse the seed balls. “We breathe and survive only because of trees. I pick up fallen seeds everyday wherever I see them and bring them home. Sometimes, my friends laugh at me. When I explain the purpose, they understand,” Blessy told STOI. It was after her father Prakruthi Prakash explained to her the importance of planting trees and improving greenery, that Blessy felt she also had to do her bit. From the seeds that she picked over the last couple of years, 30,000 have already been dispersed after making the seed balls. “If I happen to stand under a tree, I look around for seeds and pick up and add to my seed bank,” Dobbala Blessy said. Her seed bank comprises seeds of fruit trees like tamarind, neem, mango, custard apple and locally available species of flowering trees. “Whether she is playing near house or at school or walking anywhere, her concentration is only to find seeds,” Blessy’s father Prakruthi Prakash said. Much appreciation comes her way from her teachers and others in the village for her interest to pick up seeds and store them in her seed bank. By way of encouragement, some have told her that for the great work that she was doing, they would give her a present on her birthday. For Blessy, the forest beckons and she will disperse the seed balls that she herself makes to make a greener world around her.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/with-65000-seeds-sircilla-girl-sets-out-on-path-to-plant-a-green-future/articleshow/89212546.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

This is the second time the governor asked the chief secretary to come to his office and explain why leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari was not allowed to attend a programme at West Midnapore’s Netai on January 7.Dhankhar’s move came a day after Trinamool Congress planned to bring a resolution in the Bengal Assembly condemning the role of the governor. TMC MPs are likely to move a similar resolution in Rajya Sabha. It also came four days after Dhankhar led an all-round attack against the government on the occasion of 12th National Voters’ Day on January 25.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/guv-calls-chief-secy-on-mon-to-raj-bhavan/articleshow/89212553.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Cop scanner on new cabbies, background checks on anvil||Kolkata: Drivers of taxis and app-cabs who have joined the profession recently are under police scanner following three incidents — rape (Pragati Maidan), molestation (Hastings) and online-and-offline stalking (Netaji Nagar) — in which all those involved seem to have started driving during the pandemic. Oficers said they needed to verify the antecedents of drivers, something they used to do earlier but had stopped during the Covid period when they got pre-occupied with other duties. Various police stations will soon send out directives to cab owners and app-cab aggregators to ensure all drivers get their antecedents verified. On Friday, the Vidyasagar Setu and Bhowanipore traffic guards held a training on respecting women under the Nirbhaya project for taxi and auto drivers.The accused in the Pragati Maidan case had no record verified with the local police. On checking records, cops found the vehicle was registered in the name of Mohammad Nasim from Panchanangram. On raiding Nasim’s house, cops found his son Kamre Alam was at the wheel on Tuesday. In the molestation case, accused Manoj Kumar Pandit has been driving for two years. Hastings Police are yet to get any documents stating if he was verified by cops.A joint team of Netaji Nagar police and Jadavpur cyber cell nabbed a middle-aged taxi driver on January 20 for allegedly stalking a married woman online and sharing obscene images in her name. Police said the accused also created a fake Facebook account in her name to insult her. “We still have no document to show he has been verified,” said an officer.“We have found that certain driver centres and hired cab services are hiring new recruits but not getting their antecedents verified. Some do not even have registered offices. Apart from having a ready data with us, we will note down the details of vehicles each operator owns. We will also take the details of the drivers employed with these operators. Security features provided to passengers, too, will be looked into,” said an officer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/cop-scanner-on-new-cabbies-background-checks-on-anvil/articleshow/89212554.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Cabby held for molestation gets bail||KOLKATA: A 25-year-old taxi driver was arrested for allegedly misbehaving and trying to molest a 30-year-old woman in the cab on Friday evening. Accused Manoj Kumar Pandit, originally from Munger and residing in the Charu Market area, used the auto-lock so the woman and her sister could not alight or raise an alarm. The woman managed to escape and reported the matter to police around 4.30pm. The driver was nabbed around 10pm. The incident was reported briefly by TOI in its late edition on Saturday. On Saturday, the cab driver received bail at a local court. During the journey, the accused allegedly tried to strike up a conversation and then made obscene gestures and offensive comments. When the woman let her displeasure known, the accused made certain obscene propositions,” said an officer. Investigators claimed Pandit kept taking detours and outraged the modesty of the complainant inside the cab near Hastings. “After the complainant raised a hue and cry, the driver stopped the taxi at Chappell Crossing on St Georges Gate Road and fled. The complainant reported the incident to us. A team left for the residence of the registered owner of the taxi. After searching the residences of two owners at Lake Town and Tollygunge, Kumar was nabbed from Charu Market. “The accused claimed he had made no attempt to threaten or molest his passenger. We are getting the women to record statements before the magistrate,” said an officer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/cabby-held-for-molest-gets-bail/articleshow/89212555.cms||---

The court directive was in context to a PIL filed by Bhaskarnanda Halder alleging the state health department had failed to frame rules that would facilitate fixing of rates and charges by private hospitals. Shrikanta Dutta, counsel for petitioner, alleged not framing such rules was in violation of the Act. The petitioner alleged that private hospitals were taking advantage of such silence and charging high rates from patients.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/hc-directive-on-private-hospital-rates/articleshow/89212556.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Doctors argue against cold-bubble humidifiers to administer oxygen||Kolkata: Doctors at RG Kar Medical College & Hospital have questioned the use of conventional cold-bubble humidifiers for delivering oxygen to patients and sought a withdrawal of its use as it did not offer any significant advantage over room air. On the contrary, they claimed its use increases risk of infection. The humidifier was extensively used during the second Covid wave — passing the oxygen through a bottle of cold water before it is administered to patients. The doctors have published their findings in an editorial in a peer-reviewed medical journal in West Asia. Titled ‘Cold Bubble Humidification of Oxygen – Old habits die hard’, the article authored by RGMCKH critical-care medicine physician Sugata Dasgupta and doctors Atanu Chandra and Shrestha Ghosh from the internal medicine department with inputs from physician and intensivist Farhad N Kapadia of Hinduja Hospital, Mumbai, has been published in the Oman-based Sultan Qaboos University Medical Journal.“Cold-bubble humidifiers, scientifically, are unable to meet physiological needs of the upper airway, rendering them far inferior to heated humidifiers. They, in fact, increase the infection risk in a patient with Covid-infected lungs,” said Dasgupta.The authors have elucidated concepts of low-flow and high-flow oxygen therapy, physiology and physics of humidification, and risks of infection associated with cold-bubble humidifiers. The associated bacterial or fungal infection risk is not restricted to Covid patients, but is applicable to general patients on oxygen through cold-chamber humidifiers.The authors said external humidification is needed only when the oxygen flow is very high — like that of high-flow nasal oxygen, or when the upper airway is bypassed by an endotracheal/tracheostomy tube, like the one on patients on ventilator. They argued that normal, intact upper airways are enough to humidity the inspired oxygen to requisite levels from room air and cold water cannot add adequate water vapour needed by the respiratory tract. Only addition of heat by heated humidifiers or heat moisture exchangers can add the required amount of water vapour.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/doctors-argue-against-cold-bubble-humidifiers-to-administer-oxygen/articleshow/89212557.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: CCTV lead key to nail Bypass rape accused||KOLKATA: The city cops have collected footage from over four dozen CCTV cameras along EM Bypass and Park Circus to trace the movement of the app cab that was allegedly used to rape a 26-year-old hearing-and-speech-impaired woman on Tuesday evening. Cops will then carry out a reconstruction of the incident. The driver of the cab, Kamre Alam, has been arrested. Police said Alam was attempting to mislead the investigation by hiding details. He also claimed he had known the woman for some time. Cops indicated that Alam, who is in police custody for four days, may be taken into police remand again before his TI parade is carried out in jail. “We want to identify the secluded spot where she was raped after being abducted in the car,” said a police source. The woman works at an industrial unit in Kasba and had left the workplace for home as usual last Tuesday. She should have boarded a bus to Park Circus railway station but claimed she had been intercepted. A number she had dialled from the cellphone of the accused helped police nab him. DC (east) Gaurav Sharma said the clothes the driver was wearing on Tuesday have also been seized. Cops claimed Alam had been driving the car for about a month. He had even forced his father to mortgage land to buy the vehicle. The car was registered in his father’s name. “He must have been following the woman for some time before abducting her,” said an officer. The woman had shared the details of the incident with a friend. She went to Pragati Maidan police station to report the crime on Thursday. Police engaged two interpreters to decipher the woman’s version. According to her complaint, she was waiting for a bus near Ambedkar bridge around 7.30pm on Tuesday when the accused forced her into the front seat of the car. She was also robbed of Rs 5,000 that she was carrying in her purse. She was dumped at a secluded spot closer to Park Circus, she stated.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/cctv-lead-key-to-nail-bypass-rape-accused/articleshow/89212558.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||Bumpy runway, poor lights: Pilots flag areas of concern at Kolkata airport||KOLKATA: Barely meeting the minimum serviceable norms on runway lights, uneven patchwork repairs in the secondary runway, straying of animals onto the runway during monsoon, waterlogged parking bays — pilots’ list of complaints about the operational area at Kolkata airport is a long one. While some issues like proper resurfacing of the primary runway has been addressed, most of the other problems remain unresolved. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) recently slapped a Rs 20 lakh fine on the airport operator, The Airport Authority of India (AAI),for the lapses. This is the steepest fine imposed till date. An audit carried out by DGCA some months back observed improper maintenance of the runway, electrical lighting and the foreign object debris programme. It then issued a show-cause notice and levied the fine after the replies were not satisfactory. Kolkata airport officials said it had appealed to the regulator against the fine and pointed to discrepancies in the assessment. “The DGCA rates airport runways with points ranging between 1 and 9. We received a rating of 5. We have appealed against the rating and the penalty and a committee is set to revise the assessment this week,” said an airport official. According to pilots, the airport has been maintaining the minimum requirement for runway lights but rarely are all runway lights functional. “If the minimum requirement is that 80% lights have to be in operation, only that is maintained. The rest remain out of operation at all times,” said a pilot. While the primary runway condition is in fine condition now, a captain said there had been occasions in the past when the runway appeared slippery during rain due to rubber deposits. It reduces friction and affects the braking of aircraft on touchdown. The secondary runway is bumpy and potholed. In places where patchwork repairs have been carried out, the new surface has not been properly integrated with the older one. Also, when planes come in to land from the Rajarhat end of the secondary runway, there is no instrument landing system. “In the absence of vertical guidance, pilots have to rely on estimates. The VOR fluctuates during the monsoon. Many times, pilots realize the rate of descent is inadequate and have to adjust so that they don’t overshoot the runway. This can one day lead to an incident,” an airline captain said. Another problem area is the absence of green guiding lights along the taxiway that makes visibility of the track difficult during rain. Inundation of the parking bays and intrusion of jackals onto the runway during monsoon when their burrows get flooded are problems that the airport has been attempting to resolve but without much success. “The first problem requires action by neighbouring municipalities and the second one the forest department. We have raised both the issues several times,” an airport official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/bumpy-runway-poor-lights-pilots-flag-areas-of-concern-at-airport/articleshow/89212559.cms||Subhro Niyogi

The temporary bus stops are being spruced up to turn them into permanent ones. The authorities have started the process of engaging agencies and work is expected to start from February. Smart bus stops or bus passenger shelters in Action Area I, have a modern look along with commuter friendly amenities, such as electronic display boards of bus timings, a map with direction to nearby important locations, seating arrangements with a solar panel roof on top , a newspaper corner and a snack kiosk. The first of these smart bus stops in New Town was inaugurated in November 2020. The authorities are also developing some temporary bus stops into permanent facilities in different places of the township and also set up bicycle stands for cyclists to park their cycles for some time. “The idea is to have smart amenities for commuters in these bus stops while waiting for a bus,” said a NKDA official. The cycle stands are being set up so that those cycling to work can to keep them safe at one place, he added.

---||Kolkata||Showers give Kolkata a break from severe air pollution in December||KOLKATA: Rain in December ensured that the city got a break from experiencing severe pollution in what is usually one of the most polluted months of the year. There was not a single day in December 2021 when the AQI breached the 401 mark that denotes severe pollution. Usually, December and January are the worst months of the year when the air quality worsens drastically in Kolkata, sometimes even exceeding Delhi’s AQI. In 2020, a year marked by lockdown when vehicle count on the road had dropped drastically and many commercial activities were shut for months, Kolkata had experienced only one severe day. That was recorded at the continuous ambient air quality monitoring station (CAAQMS) in north Kolkata’s Rabindra Bharati University on BT Road, which usually records the city’s worst air quality. One of the biggest reasons for an improvement in the December ambient air in 2021 is meteorology. The late rain in early December, while being disastrous for agriculture, came as a blessing for the city’s ambient air. It not only cleansed the air of pollutants but brought one or two good (AQI:0-50) and two to three satisfactory (AQI:51-100) air days in December. This is rare. “The impact of meteorology on the city’s air quality is overwhelming. This is why the air quality undergoes a magical transformation from the early spring. But our sustained mitigating measures are also giving very effective results. But being at the tail end of the Indo-Gangetic plain, Kolkata has its geographical disadvantage as it acts like a sink for atmospheric pollutants of the region,” said West Bengal Pollution Control Board chairman Kalyan Rudra. However, with the drastic reduction of ‘severe’ and ‘very poor’ (AQI 310-400) days, there were rises in ‘poor’ (AQI: 201-300) days. “If the poor days also get reduced, there will be significant improvement of air quality in the city, '' said a WBPCB scientist. The study of the AQI calendar of the city revealed the degradation of air quality was worst in Salt Lake, where very poor days increased from eight in 2020 to 15 in 2021 and poor days were marginally reduced from 18 in 2020 to 11 in 2021. Fort William experienced the best recovery of ambient air with very poor days reducing from seven in 2020 to just one in 2021 and poor days remaining constant at 13. Moderate days were also reduced from seven to four.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/showers-give-kolkata-a-break-from-severe-air-pollution-in-dec/articleshow/89212562.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

---||Kolkata||Audio books link digital education with traditional oral teaching amid pandemic||Kolkata: The history of literature shows a full circle trajectory from oral literacy to manuscript culture to the printed book to e-books, and finally to audiobooks. Increasingly, audiobooks are being used as an educational tool rather than just a device for leisure. As Kolkata gears up for its second Saraswati Puja amid pandemic, educators and students share their ideas on the role of audiobooks in e-learning and its connection with past and future pedagogical cultures.“Oral storytelling has played a central role in Indian folklore and ancient myths. It has not only been a device for entertainment, for thousands of years it was also the primary method of imparting education. Students would learn ancient texts through oral recitation,” said Ipshita Chakraborty, student of MPhil in English at Jadavpur University. About the possible impact of the growing popularity of audiobooks on printed books, she said, “For my generation, buying books and reading books are different activities. The printed book will always exist as a collector’s item, even if readers explore different media, such as audiobooks, for knowledge consumption. One does not negate the other. Rather, they exist side by side and consolidate the need for each other.”“Audiobooks and printed books are not competitors but rather have always existed in a codependent space,” agreed book publisher Suvankar Dey. “Conceptually, the audiobook is nothing new. In my childhood, people would gather around to listen to the radio. But it is a misconception that the audiobook will replace the printed book. On the contrary, since the pandemic, the demand for books among students has increased drastically. I started a delivery service to accommodate the needs of students. The lives of children are most disrupted by the pandemic. With most classes being taken virtually, reading mass-printed school books helps bring a sense of normalcy to their lives.” When asked about the transition between print to digital, Dey said, “We must adapt to changing times and avail of the benefits of emerging media. I am linked with a company that makes and distributes audiobooks. I also have a Youtube channel called Dey’s Publishing in which new authors narrate their stories. But in no way do these changes pose a threat to printed books. Different platforms have different audiences, and an individual can use different media for different purposes. For example, one may listen to audiobooks for entertainment and read printed books for exam purposes.”Raj Kumar Sarkar, an employee at an ed-tech company, lamented the limited platform for vernacular literature among audiobook makers in Bengal. “A lot of young people would be keen to engage with and expand audio literature in Kolkata, especially in Bengali. Unfortunately, the scope is limited right now. A whole team of voice actors and musicians are involved in making audio literature. This is an arena that has the potential for a great deal of growth among writers and performing artists in Kolkata.” Discussing the advantages of audiobooks over printed books, Sarkar added, “Sometimes, audiobooks are more economical. On some platforms, one can have an unlimited collection of audiobooks for a minimal fee. In comparison, books can be more expensive and are more prone to damage and misplacement. For me, I love audiobooks because it allows me to multitask and keep my hands and eyes free. I especially love when the narrations are by the author, it really helps establish a connection between the writer and the audience.”Speaking on the utility of audiobooks for people with disabilities, a Kolkata-based content writer said, “Audiobooks are an ideal method of knowledge exchange among people with disability. I have dyslexia and I find it hard to finish books because I read slowly. Audiobooks really help me save time and concentrate on the content.

---||Kolkata||Covid-19: In Kolkata ICUs, respiratory distress among patients rising||KOLKATA: Severe respiratory distress and Covid pneumonia have been frequent among ICU patients across private hospitals in Kolkata in last two weeks, prompting doctors to suspect that even Omicron can trigger lower respiratory tract illnesses, especially in the case of patients who are ‘unresponsive’ to vaccines. A section of elderly patients with comorbidities may not have developed antibodies adequately, exposing them to a more severe disease, they argued. So far, Omicron-induced Covid had largely been restricted to upper respiratory tract. There could be three reasons behind a spurt over the last 10 days, said CMRI Hospital director of pulmonology Raja Dhar. “First, the residual Delta cases seem to be causing a severe Covid more frequently than they did in second wave when it was the dominant strain. Secondly, a small percentage of Omicron cases have been as severe as Delta due to a mutation that has almost wiped out the difference between the two. Finally, those still unvaccinated or partially jabbed are getting a more severe disease,” he said. Coronavirus live updatesPeerless Hospital clinical research director Subhrojyoti Bhaumik said: “Global research has shown that Omicron could be severe in some cases. Delta is still in circulation and may affect lower respiratory tract which is now happening, especially in case of elderly patients with comorbidities.” He added that a sizeable section of senior citizens could remain vulnerable to severe Covid since they are unresponsive to vaccines. “While some got a severe infection since they chose to skip vaccine or got just one dose, there are more who are fully vaccinated yet have got severe Covid. It is likely that they didn’t get adequate antibodies from vaccine which is why we need to do an antibody titer test to gauge the count and know if the recipient is actually protected against the virus,” said Bhaumik. Read Also2 years of Covid: Why some states show higher numbersIt’s been two years since the first Covid-19 case was recorded in India. Through this period — and three waves of the pandemic — Maharashtra and most of the southern states have consistently recorded more cases and deaths than other states of the country, particularly those in the north.Out of 35 patients in critical care at RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences, 11 have severe respiratory distress. “While the total number has declined, a section of critical care patients remain serious,” said zonal head R Venkatesh. Woodlands has 11 patients at Covid ICU, most of them elderly with comorbidities. “All have respiratory complaints and are on oxygen support,” said Rupali Basu, MD of Woodlands Multispeciality Hospital. Belle Vue Clinic has six patients in its Covid ICU of whom three are serious.

But the section which had severe comorbidities have been more severely affected than those for whom Covid was the principal illness,” said Dhar. He cited the instance of two patients in their forties — without comorbidities — who came out of ventilation this week. Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education & Research professor Diptendra Sarkar agreed. He, though, said there is a significant section of patients that’s immune-suppressed and have not had adequate protection from vaccines.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/covid-icus-see-rise-in-critical-cases/articleshow/89212569.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

From wedding trousseau to flowers, from food and beverage to wedding shoots, several industries which are dependent on weddings have registered a surge in demand since the government allowed attendance of 200 people at a time at weddings from its previous order of only 50 people or less in the beginning of the year due to third wave. Many couples who were on the verge of either cancelling their weddings, the auspicious period for weddings this year started January 15 onwards, changed their plans and went ahead once the government relaxed the restriction of only 50 people per wedding. “November and December were very good months for business but onset of the third wave in the beginning of January threatened of a washout of an entire wedding season. Many clients started talking about cancelling the wedding due to strict restrictions,” said Sukriti Aggrawal, manager of an event management company that designs weddings in Kolkata and other cities in the eastern region. “But as soon as the government announced that 200 people can attend a wedding very few people cancelled. They made some minor adjustments and went ahead with the wedding which has saved several industries from incurring big losses.” Several wedding dependent industries like catering, decoration and transportation employ hundreds of people who were staring at a loss of livelihood due to the third wave. “We hire most of the people on contractual basis during the wedding season. If weddings would have got cancelled, we wouldn’t have required so many people. This would have meant losses for us as well as these people,” said Samar Banerjee, who takes contract of catering in weddings. “Since only 200 people can attend a wedding the clients have reduced the items and quantity, but some people are also doing function in two shifts so that more people can attend.” Even venues have not seen widespread cancellations during third wave. “Out of 35 weddings scheduled during this season only six have been cancelled which were during the beginning of the marriage season as government order easing restriction came in a little late,” said Keshav Saraf, owner of Orchid Banquets on Vivekananda Road.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/signs-of-revival-relaxed-restrictions-spell-boom-time-for-wedding-industry/articleshow/89212570.cms||Zeeshan Javed

---||Kolkata||Colleges, universities in Kolkata turn their focus on logistics amid campus reopening buzz||KOLKATA: It’s not academics but logistics that pose a challenge for colleges and universities in Kolkata, which are now busy trying to figure how to get all students vaccinated and make campuses Covid-safety compliant amid talks of reopening. When the campuses had briefly reopened in November for physical classes, most outstation students were unwilling to join the Kolkata institutes not because they were scared of the novel coronavirus, but they did not have any place to live here. Very few colleges provide hostel facilities and even those can accommodate only a handful of applicants. Due to Covid-safety guidelines, the number of boarders has to be even fewer to maintain social distancing. The paying guest accommodations have by now either folded up operations due to lack of business over the past two years or hiked their charges. Another challenge is commute. As trains did not run for a long time till recently and buses also have become few on roads, many students found it difficult to travel to and from their institutes. Many buses have been overcharging albeit without government go-ahead and trains have been crowded. “Travelling cost has gone up. Studying online from home is a more viable option right now,” said a student from Hooghly. “A big percentage of students even in top colleges and universities in Kolkata comes from districts and from neighbouring states, including the Northeast. Many of them depend on college hostels for accommodation as they are safe and affordable. Even in pre-Covid times, we could not provide a hostel berth to every applicant and now, we also have to maintain social distancing, too. This is the reason several students opted for online classes even when they were called for in-person classes in November,” said the principal of a girls’ college in south Kolkata. Institutes started the hostel allotment procedure just before reopening of campuses in November and continued till the first week of December. “Our batch was told to attend physical classes twice a week, but I had no place to stay in Kolkata. I tried getting accommodation in a PG accommodation but the charges were high. Spending so much for twice-a-week classes made no sense. So, I decided to opt for online classes,” said Arnab Ghosh, a student from Jhargram. “Several students, who are from neighbouring districts, stay in PG accommodation in Kolkata for their tuition and to prepare for competitive examinations,” said another principal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/colleges-univs-in-city-turn-their-focus-on-logistics-amid-campus-reopening-buzz/articleshow/89212572.cms||Zeeshan Javed

Hakim said the civic body was not considering introduction of a property tax waiver scheme. “As the mayor, I enjoy a discretionary power of allowing a citizen 50% interest waiver and cent percent waiver in penalty,” Hakim said.Sources in the KMC revenue department said according to rules, if a tax defaulter wanted a reduction in interest and penalty rates, he/she first needed to apply to the assessor-collector, stating reasons for non-compliance. “If we are satisfied with the reasons, the case may be sent to the mayor for his consideration. If he gives a nod, only then the property tax payer will be entitled to such a special benefit,” a KMC revenue department official said. Hakim has asked KMC assessment department officials to prepare a list of major defaulters and send notices for payment. “If the big defaulters don’t respond, we will need to take stern action,” said a KMC assessment department senior official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/clear-tax-dues-appeals-mayor/articleshow/89212573.cms||Saikat Ray

The drainage upgrade work will be conducted under a Kolkata Environment and Infrastructure Improvement Project (KEIIP) scheme. TimesviewThis is urgently needed. We may have to live with some of the problems, like the construction that has already happened in floodwater-retaining areas, but still can try other ways to alleviate the pain.“If we get the loan sanctioned from the Asian Development Bank authorities, a major drainage upgrade project will be conducted under Phase III,” said a KEIIP official. Several councillors representing vast stretches of EM Bypass recently requested the mayor to help them find a permanent solution to the inundation of several areas off EM Bypass and multiple neighbourhoods in Behala. A fortnight ago, mayor Firhad Hakim held a meeting with the KEIIP officials and asked them to expedite the upgrade work. “We have taken up a major project for drainage upgrade for residents of vast stretches of EM Bypass and Behala. We hope to wrap up the work fast so that citizens can benefit from it as soon as possible,” said Hakim. According to a KMC drainage department official, the proposed third phase will be carried out for areas that do not have any underground sewer lines. “At present, we can’t do anything for those residents. Owing to the absence of underground sewerage, it takes only a couple of spells of heavy showers to inundate those areas. We can only operate portable pumps and flush out storm water. If underground sewer lines are laid, the sufferings of the residents will be minimized,” the civic official said. Susanta Ghosh, KMC councillor of Ward 108, expressed hope that funds would be sanctioned and the drainage upgrade project would be taken up for Chowbhaga, Bantala, Nayabad and Mukundapur among other areas. “If the project gets through, waterlogging in EM Bypass and Behala may change for the better,” Ghosh said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/kmc-to-seek-1-8k-cr-adb-loan-for-drainage-upgrade/articleshow/89212574.cms||Saikat Ray

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Half of Covid patients needing hospitalization have obesity||AHMEDABAD: Fat is not fit for fighting coronavirus. Even as hypertension and diabetes emerge as two most common comorbidities found among the Covid-19 patients, it has been found that if existing patients also have obesity or above-normal weight, they require hospitalization and a little longer hospital stay, said experts. Dr Minesh Mehta, a city-based critical care specialist, said that during the current third wave, it is observed that half the patients in the hospital setting having obesity or weight on higher side as one of the risk factors present. "In our population, hypertension and diabetes are closely associated with obesity or over-weight. But if we compare it with the second wave, the patient profile has changed – in the second wave, the majority of the younger patients requiring hospitalization and oxygen support had obesity. This time, the majority of the patients are above 50 years of age and have obesity as one of the comorbidities," he said. "During this wave, the overall hospitalization is less. And thus, we need to understand criteria for admission – if a patient has multiple comorbidities, they should get admitted on doctor's advice. One of the risk factors for these criteria is obesity, as the patient may feel breathless or have a feeling of exertion," said Dr Manoj Vithalani, a city-based internal medicine expert. "It generally is associated with other comorbidities." Dr Amit Prajapati, a city-based critical care specialist, said that it's not like the obese patients are coming more to the hospitals – it should be seen from the treatment point of view. "I would not say that one got severe Covid due to obesity – but when one has obesity, it reduces the lung capacity of the patient and also takes a bit longer time for recovery," he said. "About half of the patients requiring longer hospitalization have multiple comorbidities including obesity. Those with chronic kidney disease and those with a history of transplants have also been at risk of longer hospitalization," said Dr Anish Joshi, a city-based critical care specialist. Dr Vivek Dave, a city-based critical care specialist, said that obesity is a risk factor for both younger and older patients among the hospitalized Covid patients during this wave. "But the silver lining is, relatively less patients are getting admitted. This time around, we have not seen many young patients going hypoxic (requiring oxygen support). But we must keep an eye on the patients with multiple comorbidities including obesity," he said. Meanwhile, the state has continued its downward trend in daily Covid cases – on Saturday, Gujarat recorded 11,794 new cases, the fourth consecutive day of fall in cases. With the update, the number of active patients fell to 98,000, falling below 1 lakh after eight days. However, the Covid deaths continued to rise – against 30 deaths on Friday, the state recorded deaths of 33 active patients in 24 hours, majority of them from the cities.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/half-of-covid-patients-needing-hospitalization-have-obesity/articleshow/89212614.cms||---

Students seek clarity, schools await Madhya Pradesh government directive||BHOPAL: With schools shut, confusion prevails over mode of final exams of different classes this year. Seeking clarity on the issue, students demanded that the state government come out with a clear stand whether the exams would be online or offline mode. Students said that the existing situation has made them restless. “This is not a good situation for any student waiting for the final exams. Government should make it clear about the mode of final exams which are scheduled to be organized,” said Prateek Sharma, a student of Class 11. Asked how the exam preparations are suffering, students said there is a huge difference between online and offline exams. “We have to make several preparations for online exams. I can’t give my exams by phone. For that purpose, I need a laptop. As my father can’t afford to buy a laptop, he has assured me to buy it on a loan. If there are offline exams, I can ask my father not to take the loan. It will help my family financially to a great extent,” said Anuj Yadav, a class 11 student. Even parents felt that there should be clarity about the final exams. “My son has been asking about it for the past couple of days about the mode of exam to be conducted. I asked him to concentrate on studies and stop thinking about the exam mode. However, I know that no student can concentrate in such a situation. Government should make its stand clear so that students prepare accordingly,” said Vineeta Jain, mother of a class 9 student. Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan is to decide about the school reopening in a review meeting which is scheduled to be organised either on January 30 or 31. Schools in the state are closed till January 31. School education minister Prabhuram Chaudhary has already said that the present situation is not conducive to opening schools for offline classes even after January 31.

A thriving hub of community bonding, this temple would soon have a dhwajastambham (pillar for flag) along with a unique pebbled path, which would be visitors’ delight and add to the sense of devotion. The best part is that it is totally a community endeavour, for which people from the city as well as other parts of the country are generously donating funds.It symbolises the Trinity; in most of the South Indian temples, the pillar is set at a strategic point, said secretary of Ayyappa Sewa Sangham, Bhopal, M Vinod Kumar. “In the temples where the traditional rituals are performed, these dhwajasthambhams are made of either gold or copper. Here, we are setting up a copper pillar, which would be approximately 9 metres tall. Around 200 kg copper is being used, we performed the shilanyas on Thursday,” said Kumar.This pillar would not be a replica of any other structure, but a unique piece, informed the secretary. He went on to add, “It has been designed by traditional architects from Kerala and some highly skilled craftsmen from Mannar in Kerala will create this visual delight. There is also a pathway being made here that leads to this pillar, which has many deities represented symbolically via several stones.” Once the pillar is duly installed, there is a grand cultural celebration planned for its pran pratishtha in April. “From community prasadam to dance, music and other colourful aspects. “All the members of the community are already waiting for the weeklong festivities, which would commence on April 23,” said Kumar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/majestic-pillar-of-communitys-faith-at-barkheda-temple-soon/articleshow/89212627.cms||Vinita Chaturvedi

Many are unable to decide and are cancelling the weddings for fear that their close relatives and friends would not be enthused by not being extended an invite. Others are proceeding with online streaming as was the norm during the first and second wave. However, those who had put off weddings, hopeful of a grand function, have been left dejected.Most of the people are also scared about the complaints they are going to receive from their near ones as they have not been invited. As the wedding dates had been fixed months ago, all other arrangements, including food, decorations and transportation were also made accordingly. Even the wedding cards were printed and families had finished inviting their near and dear ones. Now, the families are busy making phone calls to the guests requesting them not to come.“We had to cancel all the arrangements and were forced to include one member from each family. We had also cancelled buses that we booked for the convenience of our relatives. The wedding date was fixed eight months ago considering the Covid cases of that time. We had a hope that things would come to normal and we could conduct the wedding of our dreams. All of a sudden, the situation has changed and that is the saddest part,” said a youth who did not wish to be named.Another family which has planned the wedding for February 12 says that they have not started any preparations. “We have not started arrangements for the wedding which is happening on February 12. The reason behind it is that we are confused and have decided that we will do according to the situation. We cannot postpone the wedding as my son works abroad and he has to leave soon after the marriage. I believe that more than minimizing the number of participants, giving a prescribed number of people per sq feet can be more acceptable. We should also consider the financially backward people who also have dreams regarding their wedding and cannot work on the arrangements again if there is no refund of the advance paid by them,” a parent said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/covid-plays-spoilsport-with-wedding-plans/articleshow/89212633.cms||---

Town Masjid, Kaniyapuram, figures in the list of religious structures which will have to be completely shifted for the silver line corridor, as per the detailed project report. The map published on the website of K-rail also shows the proposed line passing through the said religious structure.The mosque is located within Andoorkonam panchayat and the authorities of the panchayat are yet to be notified about the proposed alignment. “The mosque has a history of over six decades. Many followers have been gathering here for prayers all these years. Shifting of the mosque as part of a developmental project is something which has to be deliberated upon. We hope that the government will address our concerns,” said Sayed Ali, president of the mosque committee, Town Masjid. The committee is set to gather more details regarding the field survey.As per the DPR, nine religious structures across the state infringe upon the alignment. “In-spite of all the efforts to avoid the religious structures on the Silver Line, still nine structures (three temples, one church and five masjids) are infringing the proposed alignment. Efforts will be made to shift these during execution. Necessary action is required to be taken before the execution of the project,” the DPR notes.Panchayat ward members representing Alummodu and Kaniyapuram said there was a lack of clarity in alignment since the authorities are already dealing with an issue related to crematorium. “If the alignment infringes upon the Town Masjid, we are also concerned whether it would cross the parcel of land; the panchayat has also identified a crematorium issue. At present the panchayat has not been informed about the alignment,” said Malik, ward member.Majida Beevi, vice president of the panchayat said that the panchayat committee will consider issues regarding the crematorium and the masjid. “As regarding the crematorium, two sects already share a portion and use it for their purpose. Once K-rail is materialised, the remaining land will again be divided between the two sects. With regard to Town Masjid, it has to be taken up for discussion,” she said.The DPR notes that Thiruvananthapuram station is proposed on the eastern side of the existing Kochuveli railway station. It is kept parallel to the existing second terminal station of Thiruvananthapuram for integration with the existing railway station and it comes in between the existing Kochuveli railway station and the NH66 bypass. On the way to Kollam, it crosses NH 544 at 4 locations. There are 21 cut and cover locations for a length of 4.858 Km. The alignment also crosses major rivers at eight locations between Thiruvananthapuram and Kollam. There are three tunnels and 21 viaduct locations on the alignment from Thiruvananthapuram to Kollam.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/town-masjid-panel-hopeful-of-an-amicable-solution/articleshow/89212638.cms||Aswin J Kumar

---||Hubballi||Haveri continues to wait for its medical college||Haveri: The people of Haveri rejoiced when Basavaraj Bommai was elevated to the office of the chief minister of Karnataka. The people in the relatively new district believed that Bommai, in whom the residents have reposed immense faith having elected him to the assembly from the Shiggaon-Savanur constituency thrice, would accelerate the pace of development in Haveri. Among the longstanding demands of the residents of Haveri is that the government establish a state-run medical college. However, even after six months since Bommai was sworn in as the CM, no steps have been taken to bring this dream closer to reality. Although classes were slated to commence at the Haveri Institute of Medical Sciences (HIMS) from the 2021-22 academic year, the National Medical Council (NMC) did not give its nod. However, the Chikkaballapur Institute of Medical Sciences (CIMS) in medical education minister K Sudhakar’s home district, got the nod to start classes from the 2021-22 academic year. Stakeholders in Haveri district attributed the failure on the part of the authorities concerned to commence classes at HIMS to lack of political will. Sources said that the Karnataka government had appealed to the NMC to give its nod to start classes at medical colleges in Yadgir, Chikkaballapur, Chikkamagalur and Haveri. However, NMC refused approval to all institutions barring the one in Chikkaballapur, citing lack of infrastructure, besides lack of staff. The four medical colleges were inspected by members of the NMC in August, and a meeting was convened with the heads of the medical colleges to review the condition of the four colleges. A BJP leader in Haveri lamented the delay in HIMS being given the nod to start classes, despite the CM having been elected to the assembly from the district. “The CM must try to ensure that HIMS is given permission to start classes in 2022-23 academic year,” he said. Special officer for HIMS Dr Uday Mulagund said, “According to the academic calendar for medical courses, counselling for MBBS seats commenced on Friday (January 27). The exercise will end on March 31. Since we have two months, we hope we get NMC’s approval to start classes, and offer HIMS as an option for the students in the second and third rounds of counselling.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/haveri-continues-to-wait-for-its-medical-college/articleshow/89210433.cms||Basavaraj Maralihalli

But for some, the high-pitched horn triggers so much irritation that they end up pelting stones at the locomotive. In the past six months, six such attacks have taken place on railway lines in Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar, leaving at least three loco pilots with severe injuries that needed multiple surgeries. On Friday night, the pilot of an express train spotted two men sleeping near the railway tracks and blew the whistle to wake them up so that they would not be crushed under the wheels. Unhappy to be woken up in this manner, they threw stones at the engine, damaging it. Fortunately, driver, Chandan Kumar, did not suffer any injuries. However, there are others who were not as fortunate as Kumar. According to sources in the western railway, railway protection force (RPF) and Gujarat railway police (GRP), such attacks have been on the rise in the past few months with pilots suffering serious injuries. “In three incidents, the loco pilots suffered permanent injuries to their eyes. One of them has lost vision in one eye while the other two are undergoing surgeries and treatment. The attacks also cause damage to the engines,” said an official of the western railway. Around six months ago, Nilesh Dhanu -- the locomotive pilot of Porbandar-Kochuveli Express -- suffered critical injury in his left eye when someone threw stones at him near Ghodasar Bridge. “He was immediately rushed to LG hospital where he has been operated thrice but still he cannot see from the injured eye,” said a source in the railways. In a similar incident, the loco pilot of a goods train, Kishor Solanki, lost vision in one of his eyes in an attack that took place near Ambli junction around two months ago. Sunil Kumar, the loco pilot of a train between Mumbai and Ahmedabad, had to face a similar attack between Nadiad and Memdavad about a month ago. Apart from this, the locomotive pilot of a Demu train was attacked near Naroda. Some pelted stones at the train, shattering glass that pierced his body in several places, states railway records. In December, there were two incidents of stone pelting on the Valsad-Viramgam passenger train near Sabarmati. RPF and GRP officers probing the case said that people, who are caught in these cases, confess that they pelted stones after getting irritated by the train whistle. Joint divisional secretary in the Western railways employees’ union and director of JC bank of the railways, Sanjay Suryabali, confirmed the incidents. He said, “People need to understand that a pilot blows the whistle to save people’s lives.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/loco-pilots-blow-whistle-face-stone-pelting/articleshow/89210901.cms||Ashish Chauhan

Books at the Public Central Library in Dharwad , which was a veritable paradise for bibliophiles, too have been digitised, and uploaded on the app’s database. Furthermore, readers in Dharwad have taken to the new avatar of the library with gusto – nearly 1.5 lakh readers who have registered on the app, called the e-Sarvajanik Granthalaya, are from the North Karnataka district. The app was launched by then minister for primary and secondary education S Suresh Kumar in February 2020. In all, there are 272 public libraries across Karnataka, and thus far, the app has been downloaded by 2.5 crore readers. The cloud-based resource offers readers access to books in English, Kannada, Urdu and Marathi, in addition to the latest copies of magazines and newspapers. Deputy director of the department of libraries MB Karigar told TOI, “There are three digital libraries in the twin cities, where we have installed computers and tablets to allow readers to access books on the database. So far, the government has disbursed funds for six computers, and 12 tablets. With schools and colleges remaining closed owing to the lockdown, there was much demand from readers that they be granted access to the soft copies of the books. Students were among those who used the e-library facility extensively.” Karigar is elated that the department’s initiative to ensure readers could continue reading even when the libraries were closed owing to the lockdown. Rahul MB, a reader, lauded the government’s initiative. “During the lockdown when libraries and book shops were closed, the app helped students such as myself read many books, while preparing for competitive examinations. I was able to access books on science, commerce, management, et al,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/dharwad-boasts-1-5-lakh-readers-on-e-library-app/articleshow/89210393.cms||---

Even as hypertension and diabetes emerge as two most common comorbidities found among the Covid-19 patients, it has been found that if existing patients also have obesity or above-normal weight, they require hospitalization and a little longer hospital stay, said experts. Dr Minesh Mehta, a city-based critical care specialist, said that during the current third wave, it is observed that half the patients in the hospital setting having obesity or weight on higher side as one of the risk factors present. “In our population, hypertension and diabetes are closely associated with obesity or over-weight. But if we compare it with the second wave, the patient profile has changed – in the second wave, the majority of the younger patients requiring hospitalization and oxygen support had obesity. This time, the majority of the patients are above 50 years of age and have obesity as one of the comorbidities,” he said. “During this wave, the overall hospitalization is less. And thus, we need to understand criteria for admission – if a patient has multiple comorbidities, they should get admitted on doctor’s advice. One of the risk factors for these criteria is obesity, as the patient may feel breathless or have a feeling of exertion,” said Dr Manoj Vithalani, a city-based internal medicine expert. “It generally is associated with other comorbidities.” Dr Amit Prajapati, a city-based critical care specialist, said that it’s not like the obese patients are coming more to the hospitals – it should be seen from the treatment point of view. “I would not say that one got severe Covid due to obesity – but when one has obesity, it reduces the lung capacity of the patient and also takes a bit longer time for recovery,” he said. “About half of the patients requiring longer hospitalization have multiple comorbidities including obesity. Those with chronic kidney disease and those with a history of transplants have also been at risk of longer hospitalization,” said Dr Anish Joshi, a city-based critical care specialist. Dr Vivek Dave, a city-based critical care specialist, said that obesity is a risk factor for both younger and older patients among the hospitalized Covid patients during this wave. “But the silver lining is, relatively less patients are getting admitted. This time around, we have not seen many young patients going hypoxic (requiring oxygen support). But we must keep an eye on the patients with multiple comorbidities including obesity,” he said. Meanwhile, the state has continued its downward trend in daily Covid cases – on Saturday, Gujarat recorded 11,794 new cases, the fourth consecutive day of fall in cases. With the update, the number of active patients fell to 98,000, falling below 1 lakh after eight days. However, the Covid deaths continued to rise – against 30 deaths on Friday, the state recorded deaths of 33 active patients in 24 hours, majority of them from the cities.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/nearly-half-of-covid-patients-needing-hospitalization-have-obesity/articleshow/89210889.cms||---

Then the unthinkable happened — she became patient one, the first person in India to test positive for Covid detected in the Chinese city. That was two years ago: January 30, 2020. She has moved on, though. She wants to return to Wuhan to complete her course. “We believe Covid is manageable now. What is uncertain is my daughter’s career,” said her father.  Those were uncertain times too when she dashed out of Wuhan as the virus exploded on humanity. She reached home about a week before she tested positive, narrowly escaping harsh Chinese measures as Wuhan and international borders were sealed to stop the infection from slipping out into the community. She doesn’t want to recall her ordeal, or be reminded of it. In the past two years, she was studying remotely from home. She completed her MBBS course online last December and passed the exams. But she has to go back to her college because Chinese rules mandate that MBBS students do a 52-week in-person internship — equivalent to a house surgeon — in hospitals after final year of graduation. It’s a must to get the degree. “We request the Centre to take up the matter with the Chinese authorities for the sake of Indian medical students studying there,” her father added. He said she doesn’t want to talk about the past. “What concerns us is her present and future.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/first-indian-who-tested-covid-positive-wants-to-return-to-wuhan/articleshow/89212646.cms||Preetu Nair

Addressing a public meeting in the mining belt constituency of Sanvordem, Shah said that after examining the SC order, CM Pramod Sawant visited Delhi four times. “Mines minister Pralhad Joshi and I held several meetings with the attorney general and solicitor general, and found a way.

---||Ahmedabad||Postal dept told not to shift woman||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court ordered the department of post not to transfer a woman employee to a branch where she allegedly suffered sexual harassment, as she apprehends a similar problem once again. The court asked the department to transfer her, if she needs to be transferred, to a place of her choice given that there is a vacancy in the branch.This case is from Amreli district. A woman employee, who was given an appointment on compassionate ground as an extra departmental agent and was redesignated a ‘gramin dak sevak’, was posted at the Dadva branch office in 2007. It was at Dadva where she allegedly faced harassment from the branch postmaster. She even filed a criminal complaint for sexual harassment.More than a decade later, on December 1, 2020, the department ordered her transfer to the Dadva branch from Amreli, where she had been posted since June 2020. She objected to her transfer to Dadva and requested the government to transfer her to a branch near Amreli so that she could take care of her daughter as well. Her husband is also posted in Amreli.When her request was not heeded, she moved the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT), which rejected her application in February 2021, citing department rules and upheld the transfer order. The tribunal, however, asked the department to consider her request for a posting near Amreli town. On not getting a response to her request, she moved the HC, which immediately stayed her transfer to Dadva on the ground of her specific allegation of sexual harassment at that place. The department also conceded that the employee had given her a choice of place for transfer, but when the transfer was made there was no vacancy available at the branches she had chosen. The HC disposed of the petition by issuing directions to the department.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/postal-dept-told-not-to-shift-woman/articleshow/89212664.cms||---

However, it was one-third of the state’s daily tally of 11,794. Only Ahmedabad and Vadodara (1,816) had more than 1,000 daily Covid cases among the eight municipal corporations in Gujarat. The eight cities accounted for 66% of the daily cases, the lowest in the past 35 days. The cities in the past fortnight accounted for over 75% of the daily cases. The figure indicates reduction in Covid cases in urban areas and also rise in the rest of the state, said experts. On the other hand, Covid mortality continued to rise. The daily deaths doubled in one week from 15 on January 22 to 33 on January 29. It was the second consecutive day for the state to record deaths of 30 or more active patients in a day. The eight cities accounted for 58% of the deaths, again indicating rise of mortality in the rest of the state. With discharge of 21,655 patients compared to 11,794 new cases, active cases got reduced by 9,894 – one of the highest in the past few days – and went below 1 lakh after eight days. Experts term it the start of end of the third wave with new cases and active cases sliding past the peak. “However, caution is required as it is possible that the cases will rise after several public events, including weddings, scheduled this weekend and the next. But it is likely that the cases may remain in this range for a few days before sliding below 5,000,” said a city-based epidemiologist. Gujarat in 24 hours vaccinated 73,808 persons for the first dose and 73,044 for the second. In all, 5.11 crore are administered first and 4.51 crore second dose of Covid vaccine.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/new-cases-halve-in-a-week/articleshow/89212669.cms||---

It was for the love of Goa that Parrikar returned as chief minister after quitting as defence minister, Shah said. He said that while everyone knows Parrikar’s contribution towards Goa they must not forget what he has done for the country. “One Rank One Pension (OROP) was an issue being demanded by the armed forces since 1970. But there was no solution to it. Prime Minister Narendra Modi elevated Parrikar to the position of defence minister and gave him the responsibility of resolving the OROP issue, which he did under Modi’s leadership.” The surgical strike and modernisation of the armed forces were also carried out during Parrikar tenure, Shah said. “Parrikar made a lot of contribution in his short two-and-a-half-year tenure as defence minister and when Goa required him, he left such a big post and returned to Goa.” “I know what it is to be the defence minister of the country. Quitting that post and returning to become the CM can only be done by a person who is more worried about Goa than himself. And Parrikar did it,” Shah said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/for-goa-parrikar-gave-up-def-mins-post-shah/articleshow/89231044.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Legality of women’s hostel in housing zone upheld||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court upheld the legality of running PG hostel facilities for women in a residential society. The court dismissed a petition filed by residents of a colony objecting to construction of the seven-storey building, to be used commercially. The case involves a building on a 468 sq m plot in Goyal Park Society in Ambawadi, constructed by Abhinav Developers. Residents of the society took exception to construction and the use of the building in the society. They alleged that the AMC illegally granted construction permission and complained that commercial activity disrupts the peace of the colony. It was contended that commercial activity cannot be permitted in a residential zone. The residents argued that this PG facility cannot be termed a hostel, and is instead like a hotel. In response, the AMC defended its permissions and submitted that it granted development nod for the hostel in 2018. The AMC said it had been monitoring the construction to ensure General Development Control Regulations (GDCR) are complied with. For the owner of the plot and the developers, advocate Angesh Panchal submitted that the building has got all requisite permissions from the authorities including fire safety certificates and building-use permission. The building is on a 40-foot road, where construction of a hostel up to 25m is permissible. It was submitted that the petition was motivated and filed on the misconceived notion that a women’s hostel would cause a disturbance in the area. The advocate said the developer paid the necessary charges and fees for drainage and water connections, plan and building scrutiny fee, and tree-plantation fee. He said the construction of the hostel is permissible because it falls in the category of ‘Dwelling-3’ according to Clause 7.4 of the GDCR guidelines. Construction of a hostel is permitted in Residential Zone-1 according to Clause 7.3 on a 12-metre road, he said. The petitioners argued that the building use is not in conformity with the Regulation for Providing Hostel and Paying Guest Accommodation Bill, 2017. But the court said in its January 17 order that this bill has not become a statute yet. The court also examined other issues about the construction with regard to margin space and parking. The court said: “The court is not inclined to interfere in this petition which apparently is against the usage of subject plot for a hostel which as submitted by learned advocate for the respondent No.7 (developer) is providing hostel facility exclusively for ladies who are either students or young women having jobs.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/legality-of-womens-hostel-in-housing-zone-upheld/articleshow/89212670.cms||---

The period for the probe was to be 45 days. The collapse occurred just weeks before the flyover was to be opened. The flyover was to enable smooth passage to South Bopal residents. “The report is well on track and once submitted to the state government, it will be put in the public domain,” said a senior urban development department official. The report will also include Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority’s load bearing tests of the 113 girder boxes of the Mumatpura bridge. The bridge deck had collapsed during its post-tensioning. Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority (AUDA) has ordered load-bearing tests for all 113 girder boxes. The five-member committee set up to investigate the collapse collected concrete core samples and has been testing them at the Gujarat Engineering Research Institute (GERI) laboratory of Vadodara. The committee has a senior engineer from GERI, another from the directorate of forensic sciences (DFS), Gandhinagar, and three engineers from the state roads and buildings department. The state had appointed secretary (planning) at GAD, Rakesh Shankar, as head of the committee. The experts will examine whether the concrete used by Ranjit Buildcon, the contractor for the bridge, was strong enough and ready to undergo post-tensioning. They will investigate if any of the 24 steel tendons running through the hardened concrete snapped while the pressure gauge pulled on them tendons. The quality of various parts of the devices used in the post-tensioning or concrete-stressing will be assessed. These components include bearing plates, locker plates, extra collar, tension jack, master/pulling plate, and master grip. Even the quality of the steel strands or tendons used in the girders will be tested. “Material samples from the site will be tested at our state roads and buildings department labs to ascertain whether the quality of the raw material was maintained,” said a senior AUDA engineer. Ranjit Buildcon has been awarded contracts for several bridges and highway structures. A similar bridge collapse in Surat involving the same company had occurred in 2007 and a labourer was killed when a flyover span collapsed between Udhna Darwaza, Majuragate and Athwalines. Another structural failure was reported in the company’s 2016 flyover project in Anuvratdwar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/flyover-deck-collapse-report-by-feb-6/articleshow/89212672.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: In-service doctors want PG quota in current academic year||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court issued notice to the state government over a petition filed by in-service doctors seeking implementation of reservation for them in postgraduate (PG) courses from the 2021-22 academic year. By a resolution passed on January 10, the state authorities decided to implement 10% reservation in PG degree courses for doctors working at government health facilities from the next academic year, 2022-23. The in-service doctors, who are posted at PHCs and CHCs, have been demanding that the quota for higher medical studies be made effective from the current academic year. A petition filed through advocates Rashesh Rindani and Shirish Gohil contended that the NEET-PG exams were conducted late due to the pandemic situation. If the quota system for in-service doctors is implemented from the next academic year, doctors who have successfully cleared NEET-PG exams this year will be at a loss without any fault of theirs. The change came after the decision to reduce PG diploma seats and increase PG decree seats at the behest of the central authorities. The petitioner doctors submitted that other states have also carved out reservations for government doctors for PG courses as West Bengal has 40%, Madhya Pradesh has 30%, Tamil Nadu has 50% and Andhra Pradesh has 10% reservation. All these states decided to adopt the quota system from the academic year 2021-22. They urged the court to direct the Gujarat government to implement reservation the way these other states have done. Moreover, it has also been contended that this system is viewed as an incentive for doctors to take up government jobs and serve in rural areas.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/in-service-doctors-want-pg-quota-in-current-academic-year/articleshow/89212673.cms||---

The international terminal is undergoing a renovation for initiating added domestic operations. The primary purpose of the renovation is integrating operations of one more domestic airline from Terminal 2. “As part of this, a dedicated passage for domestic passengers is being created for smooth transition through the international terminal. Besides, separate areas are being demarcated for handling passengers. A new staircase as well as an escalator have been installed at the international terminal,” a source privy to the development confirmed. The city airport authorities are also in the process of expanding the security check area. “We will increase the number of security checkpoints so that more passengers can be handled with a lesser turnaround time. Additional door frame metal detectors in addition to x-ray baggage scanning machines will be deployed for a quick transition,” said the source. A lounge has already been operationalized at the international terminal for added passenger convenience and comfort. Besides, additional food and beverage options are also being made available for passenger comfort. The proposal to shift operations of two domestic airlines to the international terminal is going on since October last year. “To start with, SpiceJet Airlines will operate from Terminal 2 in addition to the existing operations of Air India and its subsidiary airline – Alliance Air, and the International carriers,” said an airport spokesperson. Sources confirmed that operations of GoAir are also likely to be shifted to T2; however, discussions between the airport operator and airlines are still underway. Sources said that approximately 17-20 flights have scheduled operations by SpiceJet every day from the SVPI airport in Ahmedabad. “With shifting of operations, there will be a great deal of decongestion at the domestic terminal and ease of passenger movement, reducing turnaround time for check-in and security-check. Meanwhile, this will also enable airlines to start out with more flights to meet growing passenger needs,” said a top source at the SVPI airport.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/intl-terminal-being-renovated-to-handle-added-domestic-ops/articleshow/89212674.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: One runway incursion at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport||AHMEDABAD: Hampering of flight movement due to a runway incursion was barely saved in the nick of time at the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International (SVPI) airport in Ahmedabad earlier this month. In response to an RTI, the Airports Authority of India (AAI) revealed that a runway incursion was reported at the city airport on January 9 this year by a mechanical runway sweeper (MRS) vehicle, which was inappropriately positioned along the runway and came in the way of landing and take-off of aircrafts, at 10.56am. A runway incursion is an aviation incident involving improper positioning of vehicles or people on any airport runway or its protected area. This is the lone incident that occurred at the SVPI airport in the past one year. “The last aircraft airborne was at 10:51 hrs and there were no further flights thereafter because of the routine runway maintenance from 11am to 3pm on Sunday. As a standard operating procedure, the MRS Vehicle maintains the runway for safety measures. The standard process is a handover call by ATC to Follow-Me Operations Vehicle and Follow-Me Operations Vehicle further guides all vehicles to the runway for maintenance. The MRS vehicle slowly moved towards the runway at 10:56 hrs and was stopped by ATC through the Follow-Me Operations vehicle,” said the city airport authorities. The airport has undertaken a complete runway recarpeting since January 17, which is expected to continue till May 31. The work will focus on runway overlaying, runway strip grading and slope assessment, runway end safety area (RESA) grading and slope assessment, along with storm water drain construction and reinstallation of signages on manoeuvring area.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/one-runway-incursion-at-svpi/articleshow/89212675.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Forced to share rooms in Europe, reparation ordered||AHMEDABAD: A consumer court ordered a city-based tour operator to compensate a tourist, whose family was made to share an apartment in Switzerland with strangers, during a tour of Europe in 2017. The case involves Brijesh Bhatt of Vadodara and Olive Tours Pack Pvt Ltd. In May 2017, Bhatt’s family went on a tour of Europe organised by Olive Tours and paid Rs 4.47 lakh towards the package. When the tourists reached Switzerland, they were supposed to stay in an apartment allotted to them. However, when they got to the apartment, they found it already occupied by a family of three. The Bhatt family found it difficult to adjust but said that they could not afford the extra expense of 120 Swiss francs per day for a separate hotel room and had to accommodate the strangers. When Bhatt expressed his displeasure to the tour manager, he was promised a 50% refund. This did not happen and Bhatt approached the Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission, Ahmedabad (city) and urged it to direct the tour operator to refund half the cost of the package. The commission issued notice to the tour operator but did not receive a response, leading it to hear the case ex parte. After hearing the case, the commission said, “When tourists go on a foreign tour after spending such a big amount, they go with high expectations and when they have to share a room with strangers, it is natural that they get a shock.”  It took notice of the fact that the Bhatt family paid Rs 1.14 lakh towards rent for the apartment, but since they had to share it with other family, the tour operator was ordered to refund half of this amount – Rs 57,000 with 7% interest. It also ordered the tour operator to pay Rs 30,000 as compensation to the tourists for their legal expenditure and the harassment caused to them.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/forced-to-share-rooms-in-europe-reparation-ordered/articleshow/89212676.cms||---

The state government had in principle agreed to the proposal made by engineering colleges. The colleges were pursuing their demand because nearly 35,000 seats remain vacant every year, whereas most of Group B students cannot make it to medical courses because of shortage of seats.

As per the data available, in 2020, MIA welcomed 5,40,928 passengers, which rose to 7,72,555 in 2021, a whopping growth of 70%. With this growth, MIA, the second busiest in the state after Kempegowda International Airport, has been able to get back to traffic levels as it was before the pandemic. “The growth would have been more positive if not for the pandemic, which almost grounded the aviation sector in the last two years. The growth at MIA, in terms of domestic passengers or flights has been tremendous. It will bounce back further, once Covid-19 is over,” said a senior official of a leading aircraft carrier, who added that domestic passenger traffic will shoot up again in a few days. “A lot of air travellers who couldn’t travel in 2020 due to travel restrictions, started to fly to various tourist destinations in 2021. There was revenge tourism, and as a result, there is an upward growth in the domestic industry. The growth is likely to continue in the coming days,” the official expressed. Currently, four airlines operate domestically, and connect to various cities of India. Among them, Indigo tops the list, with the highest domestic flights operations. “After the second wave of the pandemic, the domestic flights at MIA started to pick up, starting from August. In October, MIA saw 781 domestic flights operations, which increased to 798 in November, and jumped to 953 in December. This is a sign that there is a robust growth of the domestic airline market,” said an executive. An executive of a low-cost airline said that domestic flights saw a negative growth soon after the new year began. However, it is improving except for night flights. “From past three days, the passenger load has been good. The flights to Bengaluru and Mumbai are running at full capacity. People are now not worried about the new Covid-19 variant, since it has mild symptoms, which has led to an increase in the movement of domestic passengers. The only issue they have, is to produce a negative RT-PCR report while boarding,” added the executive.

The 90-minute film is dedicated to his father, who passed away after a stroke last July. Talking to TOI from Philadelphia, the 34-year-old Jamia Millia Islamia and JNU alumnus said the film is an attempt to do something about this "general omnipresent greyness in Delhi, where the atmosphere itself becomes hostile towards you", like "an air-conditioner of a spaceship going awry". A still from ‘All That Breathes’ Sen, who was laid low by Covid last year, expressed deep regret at not being able to show the film to his father. "2021 was the worst year of my life. Everything in the film is permeated by a sense of longing, moments of grief and engagements with questions of mortality. The film is an expression of who you are in the most intuitive and deep senses. When one goes through a loss that shifts the very coordinates of your life, it is impossible to keep that away from what you are making," he said. Yet, Sen overcame his personal loss to create the film. The Sundance citation announced by jury member Emilie Bujes said, "This poetic film delivers an urgent political story while constructing a singular and loving portrait of protagonists resisting seemingly inevitable ecological disaster - with humorous touches punctuated by unsentimental depiction of the animal kingdom. For maintaining its suspenseful tension when portraying the interior struggles of its characters and the contradictions in spirituality and materialism they confront, we present the Grand Jury Prize to All That Breathes." Reacting to the news, Sen told Sundance in a video put out on Twitter, "I am absolutely speechless and utterly beaming...I have no cliched way of saying this but I can't thank you enough..the film came into existence a large part due to Sundance's support." Work on the film began in 2019. Asked how the idea struck him, Sen spoke of "the grey hazy monotone laminates our life," the "tiny dots" or black kites (cheel) which glide on the city's skies and the "noxious air" we breathe. Then he started looking for the protagonists. "We met the brothers: Nadeem and Saud. There was a fair bit of media work on the remarkable work they do. Their life itself had a cinematic, surreal quality. They work out of a tiny derelict basement where there is industrial decay where these magisterial yet vulnerable birds are treated. The bipolarity itself was very cinematic. That's how we began," he told TOI. "We developed a grammar which was not a regular observational verite film... but something more poetic and lyrical to depict something real," he said. The film was edited in Denmark. In its film review, Variety also wrote that “the sense of a city as a complex, ailing ecosystem is rendered with unusual vividness in the film” adding that the environmental impact is felt on the microcosmic level of two resident brothers dedicated to urban bird rescue. Meanwhile, they worry about a different kind of threatened extinction event: anti-Muslim policies that trigger waves of protest and violence,” the magazine said. Sen’s debut feature-length documentary, Cities of Sleep (2016), was acclaimed and applauded in film festivals across the world. The Sundance Film festival, which is hosted in Utah in the USA, began in 1978. Among others actor-director Robert Redford played an important role in its shaping.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/wish-my-dad-had-seen-the-film-sen/articleshow/89211833.cms||Avijit Ghosh

While the majority of the wards of the GVMC will be retained in the existing Visakhapatnam district, Anakapalli town and adjacent villages of Pendurthi and Sabbavaram mandals will fall into the newly proposed Anakapalli district. Anakapalli and some neighbouring villages were merged into the GVMC in 2013. The territory of the Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Region Development Authority, which is currently spread in Visakhapatnam and Vizianagaram, will be extended to three districts. It is not clear how the formation of the new districts will affect the administrative and developmental affairs of the GVMC or the VMRDA. Meanwhile, Pendurthi MLA A Adeepraj gave a representation, requesting the officials to continue Pendurthi in Visakhapatnam district instead of merging it in the newly proposed Anakapalli district. As Pendurthi is located very close to the city, several people are requesting to retain it in Visakhapatnam district. Only 10 mandals will be retained in Visakhapatnam district out of the existing 43 mandal. Of these mandals, other than Padmanabham mandal, the remaining 9 districts are fully urbanised or semi-urbanised. In all, Visakhapatnam district will be divided into three different districts with several tribal parts going into Alluri Sitarama Raju district. As per the new district proposals, Gajuwaka, Pedagantyada, Gopalapatnam, Mulagada and Seethammadhara will continue under Visakhapatnam revenue division.  A new revenue division, namely Bheemunipatnam, will be created in Visakhapatnam district out of Anandapuram, Padmanabham, Visakhapatnam rural, Bheemunipatnam and Maharanipeta mandals. The new revenue division is expected to play a key role in the future development as a huge land bank is available in Anandapuram, Padmanabham and Bheemunipatnam mandals. The key offices of executive capital, if it is branched out to Visakhapatnam, may come up in these mandals.  Anakapalli district will be a mix of rural pockets, fast urbanising suburbs, and industrial areas. Alluri Sitaramaraju district will be carved out of the tribal areas in the existing Visakhapatnam district and some tribal parts from the East Godavari district.  With 10 mandals, Visakhapatnam will be the smallest district in the state spread over 928 square kilometres.  Jana Sena GVMC corporator P Murthy Yadav said the creation of new districts may not affect the affairs of the urban bodies. “For instance, GVMC has offices in all zones and wards, even including Anakapalli. I think the administration will continue as usual,” said Murthy.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/gvmc-to-spread-in-2-dists-vmrda-in-3-after-dist-rejig/articleshow/89212695.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

State breached the 10,000 daily infection mark for the first time in the ongoing third wave on January 19. Since then, the daily caseload has remained around 12,000 to 15,000 for the last 10 days.  Even the daily hospitalisation and discharge numbers have stabilised around 400 to 600. The case positivity rate, which gives a peek into the disease transmission trends in the community, is hovering in the range of 28% to 35%. Going by the daily new Covid-19 infection incidence, Chittoor might have already attained its peak in the third wave. The district, which posted more than 2,000 cases at one point, is recording about 400 cases a day for the last several days.  Districts like Kadapa, Kurnool, Guntur and Anantapur, which reported fewer cases until a week ago, are witnessing somewhat of a surge in the case numbers.  As is widely believed, the Omicron-led third wave has led to fewer hospitalisations compared to the previous waves in Andhra Pradesh. For instance, about 14,600 required hospital care during the peak active caseload of 1.03 lakh in September 2020. But only 2,800 patients have been admitted to various hospitals out of the 1.15 lakh active cases in the ongoing third wave as of Saturday.  Due to the adverse experiences it encounter in the second wave, the state health department has lined up about 710 hospitals with 55,000 beds. But as of Saturday, more than 95% beds have remained vacant. However, the daily caseload might have been manifold than the official count as one or the other family member in almost every household is experiencing fever or other similar symptoms. As the Omicron is believed to be a milder variant, people are skipping Covid-19 tests and physician consultation, and are self-medicating, which was not there during the first and second waves.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/amaravati/daily-covid-caseload-stabilises-around-12-15k/articleshow/89214683.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

The accused was arrested and has confessed to the crime. Arilova police station inspector T Emmanuel Raju said a man’s body was found under suspicious circumstances in Gudlavanipalem on April 11 last year. Police registered a case under 174 of CrPC (suspicious death) as they couldn’t establish the identity of the deceased. However, the deceased was later identified as M Srinivasa Rao (43), a resident of Yendada. As cops restarted the investigation, they came to know that Rao’s wife eloped with one Surada Laxman (26) three years ago. Cops checked the CCTV footage in the area where the body was found, where one footage showed the deceased going on a bike with another person on April 11, the day his body was found. Laxman and Rao’s wife, who used to stay in new railway colony, were also found to have fled the city on the same day. A few days back, Laxman returned to the city and cops, who had been tracking his movements for the last several months, picked him up. During interrogation, he confessed he had killed Rao after he threatened to take back his wife.

The secretary of school education, Rajesh Sharma, gave the information after a meeting with education minister Jagarnath Mahto at the latter’s residence.Sharma said, “A proposal for reopening of schools was sent to SDMA between the second and the third Covid wave. We will send a fresh proposal seeking the same. The department is of the view that restriction of four hours for offline classes followed earlier was not yielding desired results so normal routine should be allowed.” Sharma said that final decision on the matter would be taken by the SDMA headed by chief minister Hemant Soren.Earlier the education minister also expressed his view in favour of starting offline classes. He said, “Closure of schools for the past two years has caused big losses to students particularly those from poor families. All students are at home for the past two years which is a long period.”Mahto said that he is not satisfied with the online mode of education as students, particularly from the poor families, are adversely affected by this system. Mahto said that now a cut-off date should be fixed on reopening of schools.On matriculation and intermediate examinations, Mahto said that he has given oral instructions to Jharkhand Academic Council to hold the examinations on time whatever be the method, online or offline.Earlier in the day, 50 members of Private Schools and Children Welfare Association led by its state president Alok Dubey met the education minister to demand starting of offline classes. Dubey stated that schools have remained closed for the past 22 months. He added that around 47,000 teaching and non-teaching staff of private schools are facing economic crisis due to the prevailing situation. He mentioned that many private schools have closed down due to financial crisis.Meanwhile, Jharkhand Parents’ Association president Ajay Rai said that it would be better to open schools after students are vaccinated.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/edu-dept-to-write-to-sdma-on-reopening-of-schools/articleshow/89212708.cms||Sanjay Sahay

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Defunct collars expose 5 Sariska tigers to poaching||JAIPUR: Big cats in Sariska Tiger Reserve (STR) are exposed to poaching and revenge killings because of defunct radio collars. Currently, radio collars on the neck of all the five adult tigers — ST-10, ST-13, ST-2, ST-3 and ST-9 — are inoperative. The state forest department will take up the issue during the meeting on the topic, ‘Midterm Review of Current Status of Sarsika Tiger Reserve Post Tiger Reintroduction, Tiger Translocation and Radio Collaring Strategies in the State of Rajasthan' scheduled in STR on February 3. Chief wildlife warden (Rajasthan) Arindam Tomar said, "Discussions will be held with National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) and Wildlife Institute of India (WII) scientists. After the meeting, a decision will be taken to replace or remove the collars." STR, which is spread over 800 sqkm, is home to 25 tigers including 11 females, nine males and five cubs. Sources said without a functioning collar, it is difficult to monitor the movement of tigers in Sariska, which has numerous narrow valleys and sharp and high ridges. Moreover, constant vigil is crucial as big cats have territories near villages, which are notorious for snaring and poaching. A source said, "Traces of male tiger ST-13 have not been found for the past 10 days following the recent rainfall. The collar of the tiger is defunct. Monitoring becomes easier if collars are functional. In 2018, tigress ST-5 fell victim to poaching right after its collar stopped working." Environmentalists urged the NTCA and the forest department to immediately take a call on radio collars as these gadgets weighing between 1.4kg and 2kg are hung around the necks of tigers for many years. Dinesh Verma Durani, founder and general secretary of Sariska Tiger Foundation said, "Few collars haven't been working for the past several years. For instance, tigress ST-2 collar has been defunct since 2011. The gadget should be either replaced or removed." Following the 2018 poaching debacle, the then standing committee of the State Board for Wildlife (SBWL) directed to replace the obsolete hand-held antenna collar system with the advanced GPS-enabled VHF collars. A project to replace the collars was initiated in 2018 which helped ST-9, ST-10 and ST-3 get new ones.

The MANSI+ will cover 38 developmental blocks across East Singhbhum, West Singhbhum and Seraikela districts in the Kolhan division of Jharkhand. It will reach out to approximately four million marginalized and vulnerable tribal people in 5,000 villages for a period of five years (June 2021 to May 2026).The ECA was signed by additional mission director of NHM, Bidyanand Sharma Pankaj, senior programme manager, AIF, Anupam Sarkar and head, public health, Tata Steel, Dr Anuj Bhatnagar.Pankaj said: “MANSI has emerged as a good, collaborative programme in achieving the Sustainable Developmental Goals. We are happy to extend this partnership towards taking ahead MANSI+ across Kolhan districts in Jharkhand. We also look forward to extending the project to other geographies in the state.”MANSI+ has been conceived as a life cycle approach, seeking to reduce preventable maternal, newborn and under five years child mortality by 50% (from baseline) and improved health outcomes in adolescents and young children in continuum of care. This will be achieved by strengthening the capacity of the government frontline workers Ashas, ANMs, AWWs and schoolteachers, to deliver quality home-based care, empowering adolescents and targeting critical issues related to maternal health and newborn mortality.Further, MANSI+ will drive a social behavioural change communication campaign to raise awareness and shift social norms surrounding prevention of early marriages, teenage pregnancies and spacing of births. This is expected to save and improve lives, focus on areas such as maternal and child health, family planning, nutrition and early childhood development.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/pact-to-improve-access-to-child-and-maternal-care-in-kolhan/articleshow/89212716.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Liquor body slams govt move to take over booze trade||Ranchi: The International Spirits & Wines Association of India (ISWAI), a representative body of premium alcoholic beverage companies, on Saturday criticised the Jharkhand government’s alleged move to take over the liquor trade stating that it will disrupt the sector which is already battling the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.Last week, the state cabinet approved the roping in of Chattisgarh Beverage Corporation Limited (CBCL) as an advisory to the excise department and its beverage corporation limited for hand-holding exercise to help the tribal state increase its revenues. The liquor retailers and the associations apprehend that this is the first step towards the government’s plan to take over the liquor business claiming that a similar move in Jharkhand and other states had failed in the past.Criticising the regular change in government policy, Suresh Menon, secretary-general, ISWAI, said, “The recurring changes in the alcohol beverage retail model in Jharkhand may once again disrupt the business and pose myriad challenges due to issues of supply chain that may have a bearing on consumer choice and availability. During the earlier regime in 2017, a similar move was adopted which led to denial of sale of known brands, the exponential growth of sale of little known brands, lack of stock visibility in retail and a non-transparent payment process. As an impact of that policy, the industry is still facing the fallout of the earlier government-in-retail experiment by way of outstanding overdue for over two years.”Due to fiscal losses and the opposition’s criticism, the government had withdrawn its regulation over retail trade in 2019.As a result, both the revenues and sales volumes increased compared to the years when the retail was under the state government/Jharkhand State Beverages Corporation Ltd (JSBCL) control.“For example, Jharkhand government had generated revenue of Rs 957 crore during the financial year 2016-17 that decreased to Rs 846 crore during 2017-18 when it started selling liquor. After the change in model to private retail in 2019, revenue increased to Rs 2,084 crore and declined slightly to Rs 1,859 crore during the Covid pandemic. Industry numbers suggest that there has been no downward trend in liquor consumption in the states in the last two years,” said another official of ISWAI.Nita Kapoor, chief executive officer of ISWAI, said that while the pandemic has disrupted normal business across the sectors, due to Covid restrictions in Jharkhand and significant tax increases has led to a decline in the alcoholic beverage business.Kapoor added, “For many years, Delhi too had a retail model regulated by government but it had to ultimately bring in private players for better revenues. Even Andhra Pradesh too is trying to woo back private players in the face of considerable loss of revenue and a public outcry about popular brands being unavailable. Hence, the ISWAI urges the Jharkhand government for a fair, transparent and robust business model in the state. For a sector that is a key source of the state’s own tax revenues post-GST, such frequent changes in route-to-market (RTM) are undesirable and would disrupt the industry.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/liquor-body-slams-govt-move-to-take-over-booze-trade/articleshow/89212717.cms||ASRP Mukesh

The car dealers, including company-run showrooms of used-cars are selling an average of 80-100 cars a month. The year 2021 was the best year in terms of sales, the dealers claim. They hope the industry will continue to thrive, going by the constant inquiries and the number of bookings. On a average, they get around five bookings and inquiries every day, claim the dealers. Manjunath, manager in a pharmaceutical company, did not wait long after the Covid outbreak and the subsequent lockdown in 2020 to buy a used car. The safety of his family — his elderly parents — was the prime concern during the pandemic. At a time when jobs are drying owing to Covid-induced restrictions, buying a new car was not a good option. So I preferred a pre-owned car that suited my budget,” he says. Like him, many of his friends and acquaintances too bought pre-owned cars during the Covid time, he claims. A company showroom representative says the demand for used-cars never decreased in the last two years. The company offers cars that are older than five to seven years and provides a one-year warranty and three free services to the buyers. “Vehicles are given in good condition to our customers as per company’s standards and so far there hasn’t been any complaint,” he adds. Ganapathy PM, vice president of a car dealer agency, told TOI the pre-owned car business has boomed during the pandemic time. “Earlier, on an average, 50 used cars were sold every month and today, during the pandemic, it is above 80 to 100 cars every month. It is a boom year for the industry,” Ganapathy says. Advaith Hyundai dealers general manager Shankar Narayan said pre-owned cars of his company are in great demand. “On an average, over 75 units of used cars are being sold every month,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/covid-driving-rapid-growth-of-pre-owned-car-sector/articleshow/89212734.cms||Lawrence Milton

Mysuru MP Pratap Simha, who came under fire from BJP MLAs SA Ramadas and L Nagendra, has asked the MLAs to express their opposition to the project by writing to PM Narendra Modi. The two legislators publicly expressed opposition to the piped gas project in Krishnaraja and Chamaraja constituencies expressing concern that the asphalted roads will be dug up for laying the pipes and cause inconvenience to residents. The MLAs had also vented their ire ay Simha for claiming credit to the projects in their segments. At a press meet here, Simha said the lead he got in the Lok Sabha polls was more than the total votes secured by the MLAs in the assembly elections. “MLA Nagendra has claimed he is responsible for my victory in the Lok Sabha election. But in the assembly election, KG Koppal ward where he was born and brought up rejected him. He even failed to get votes for the party candidate from the ward in the MCC polls who had to face a humiliating defeat,” he said. Stating that he is responsible for all the development projects, which was initiated in Krishnaraja and Chamaraja segments including drinking water project, solid waste management, airport expansion, Bengaluru – Mysuru expressway, Simha said that it was he who had even arranged a flight from Mysuru to Goa for the MLA and his followers for a tour. “Both Ramadas and Nagendra were corporators before becoming MLAs. Both were silent when JUSCO and private service providers dug up roads mercilessly to lay water pipes and cables in the city. They have to tell the real intention of expressing opposition for digging roads to the gas pipe project,” he said. He also expressed anger against the MLAs for cancelling the MCC council meeting where the subject was supposed to be discussed. “The MLAs had threatened corporators from attending the council meeting. Due to a lack of quorum, the meeting was dismissed. The company, which is taking up the project, will also take up the responsibility to asphalt the dug up roads within a week. After the completion of the project, residents will get LNG gas for just Rs 550, which is cheaper than LPG which costs Rs 904 per cylinder,” he said and asked the MLAs to write to PM Modi and Union petroleum minister Hardeep Singh Puri expressing their opposition to the project.

In an order issued in January 2020, the government had directed to display portraits of Ambedkar and Mahatma Gandhi during Republic Day celebrations at all educational institutions. However, the government has not made it clear to display Ambedkar’s portrait during such celebrations by the district administration and courts, he stated. Dhruvanarayana demanded action against principal district and sessions judge Mallikarjuna Gowda, who had allegedly got the portrait removed before unfurling the national flag. Meanwhile, Chamarajanagar MP V Srinivas Prasad has demanded the government to conduct a detailed probe into the issue. On Saturday, he said he was pained by this incident. He condemned the insult to the architect of the Indian Constitution by a district judge “intentionally or unintentionally”. Dalit organisations staged protests over the issue in Mandya on Saturday. The protesters, who converged at the DC’s office, raised slogans against Raichur district judge Gowda. “It is unimaginable to think that a district judge may remove the portrait of Dr Ambedkar whose contribution in the framing of Indian Constitution is unparalleled,” the protesters said. The agitators also urged the government to take back the citizenship of the erring judge besides prosecuting him for his alleged act.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/cong-condemns-removal-of-ambedkars-portrait/articleshow/89212737.cms||---

This will be the real tribute to the great sons of Bharat Mata. The heroic stories of our martyrs are an inspiration for generations,” Baghel tweeted. Without naming the BJP-RSS, he said, “Those who did not fight for the country will not understand this.” The move assumes significance in the wake of the recent ‘merging’ of the eternal flame of Amar Jawan Jyoti beneath India Gate with the one set up at the National War Memorial in 2019 a few hundred meters away.

According to aviation industry stakeholders, the closure of the ghat section for six months will result in travellers avoiding roads and taking flights to Bengaluru. The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has proposed closing the Shiradi Ghat stretch of national highway completely for six months, in order to make a four-lane road from Donigal, on the outskirts of Sakleshpur, to Maranahalli, a distance of 220 km to 230km. “With this proposed closure, we are expecting that the demand for domestic flights from Mangaluru to Bengaluru will increase, since not many people would want to take a long route to reach the state capital,” said an executive of a low-cost airline. Currently, 10 flights are being operated per day on the Bengaluru-Mangaluru sector. For the time-being while an airline has cancelled a flight to Bengaluru due to poor passenger load, another carrier operates only night flights. “We have observed that the passenger load to Bengaluru is slowly picking up. There is no advance booking, but tickets are booked two days prior to the journey. Most of the travellers fly on personal visits, such as weddings and other similar engagements. There are few corporate bookings. The airlines are also expecting a surge in bookings, starting with the onset of summer,” said an executive. According to a KSRTC Volvo bus driver, if the work commences after the closure of the Shiradi Ghat stretch, Airavat (Volvo) and other buses will ply via Mangaluru-Madikeri-Holenarasipura-Bengaluru or Mangaluru-Madikeri-Mysuru-Bengaluru routes. Cars and other smaller vehicles can traverse through Charmadi Ghat. There is also fear of landslides in these ghat sections during the rainy season, which causes the stretch to get blocked.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/aviation-sector-may-gain-if-shiradi-ghat-nh-closes-for-6-months/articleshow/89209642.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

The 1994 batch IPS officer had moved the High Court for bail after a special court in the state capital remanded him to 14-day judicial custody on January 18. Earlier, special court judge Leena Agrawal had rejected his bail plea. The arrested IPS officer has been maintaining that he is being victimized and the allegations against him were fabricated after he refused to toe the line with regard to the cases pertaining to the PDS scam. The economic offences wing (EOW) and the anti-corruption bureau (ACB) had raided the residence and other premises of G P Singh in July last year. Later, the investigating agency claimed that the raids had yielded assets worth rs 10 crore and Rs 16 lakh in cash, along with several documents. However, the anti-corruption probe against the IPS officer took a new turn within a week when the state police booked him on charges of sedition and promoting enmity. An FIR was filed at Raipur’s Kotwali police station on the intervening night of July nine and 10 under IPC section 124A for sedition and 153 A for promoting enmity. After anti-corruption raids and FIR for sedition against him, the IPS officer had sought anticipatory bail from a local court, which rejected his application. Later, the high court and the Supreme Court turned down his plea for probe by an independent agency like the CBI into the sedition case against but he did not get interim relief. Later, the ACB arrested the IPS officer from Gurugram on January 11||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/hc-to-hear-bail-plea-of-suspended-adgp-on-monday/articleshow/89212740.cms||---

Commissioner’s inspection exposed illegal hawkers and their stalls at the temple complex at Kanaka Durganagar area. After receiving hundreds of complaints about corrupt practices of employees at Kanaka Durga temple, commissioner Hari Jawaharlal conducted surprise inspection at the temple on Thursday afternoon. Commissioner interacted with the hawkers and learnt that a few temple employees were collecting money from them for arranging stalls. Employees are at liberty to break the rules framed by the trust board not to arrange stalls at other places of the temple except at Maha Mandapam. Commissioner also identified MRP violations at the stalls arranged at the temple and conveyed his displeasure to the staff of the estates wing of the temple. Commissioner questioned the officials as to why they are allowing stall owners to sell snacks, toys and pooja essentials at higher price. Commissioner directed the temple EO to initiate action against the officials who are encouraging corrupt practices. Commissioner said many employees are working at the temple for years without transfers which is also a reason for the corruption. Temple authorities are anticipating transfers after the inspections of the commissioner. EO Bramaramba directed the estate wing of the temple to submit a detailed report on corrupt practices to initiate action. Trust board is serious about the malpractices by the employees. “We will support the action proposed by the temple authorities against such persons,” trust board chairman Paila Sominaidu said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/inspection-exposes-corruption-at-temple/articleshow/89212747.cms||Venu Lanka

Though emergencies are lesser when compared to second wave during April 2021, patients are finding it hard to move to hospitals as fares charged by private ambulance operators are skyrocketing.  Cases with sudden fall in oxygen saturation levels are very rare in third wave. But patients with comorbidities are getting weak and facing complications like shortness of breath, body pain and high fever. Doctors suggest such patients be shifted to hospitals for better treatment.  But private ambulance operators are looting the patients by increasing the fares by five times. Shifting bodies to other districts has become a costly affair as free government ambulance services are extended till the boundaries of that district and one should opt for private ambulances to shift bodies to other districts.  “My aunt died of Covid-19 at a private hospital in Vijayawada. We thought of shifting the body to our native place Denduluru which is around 76 kilometres from Vijayawada. But ambulance operators demanded 22,000 for shifting the body which we cannot afford,” said K Ramesh, a farmer.  Situation is worse at government general hospital where ambulance operators are an organised force who attack other ambulance drivers who offer trips for lesser price. Joint collector L Siva Shankar and district medical and health officer Dr. Suhasini said they are planning to lay focus on implementing rate card as per distance.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/pvt-ambulances-charge-a-bomb-to-carry-patients/articleshow/89212749.cms||Venu Lanka

Existing schools will be transformed into foundation schools, foundation plus schools, high schools and high school plus categories. Only students will change schools as per their eligibility and no school will be closed,” the minister said.He also expressed satisfaction over the physical classes in schools. “Many parties opposed the government while we decided to conduct physical classes after Sankranti despite the Covid-19 fear. We implemented Covid-19 guidelines and achieved best results. Many states are implementing a model similar to that implemented in Andhra Pradesh and reopening their schools,” Suresh said.“Despite odds, we have conducted classes and we hope this academic year will be completed peacefully,” Suresh said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/min-debunks-rumours-of-school-closures/articleshow/89212751.cms||Venu Lanka
---||Vijayawada||Now, public places turn watering hole in Vijayawada||VIJAYAWADA: The bar may not be the most obvious place to enjoy a drink, feel some locals in the city, who have instead opted for bus stands, empty spaces under flyovers and other public spots. When STOI spoke to some of these people, it turned out that the most common reason for boozing in public places was the hefty price of liquor in bars. “We can’t afford the expense of bars in Andhra Pradesh, though prices were recently slashed,” said a man having a drink on a roadside near Benz Circle, on condition of anonymity. “Our income just won’t allow it. We work in the construction sector and as daily wagers, we are habituated to drinking everyday to numb our bodily aches. Earlier, we could drink in permit rooms at wine shops, but now we don’t have these facilities and can’t afford the heavy prices in bars,” he added. But drinking in public has emerged as a concern for commuters, especially women, on these roads. N Durga, who works at a hotel near Benz Circle told STOI, “Everyday we use these roads to travel to our workplace and it’s very inconvenient and we are scared to take this route with people consuming alcohol.” The absence of permit rooms, unlike earlier or in Telangana, has meant that many residents no longer have a place where they can consume alcohol. Though liquor prices were recently slashed in the state, they are still high compared to Telangana.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/now-public-places-turn-watering-hole/articleshow/89212752.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: Two underpasses on Outer Ring Road to cut locals’ travel by 3km||NEW DELHI: In a big relief to locals, two underpasses will come up on Outer Ring Road in north Delhi by the end of this March, Public Works Department officials said on Saturday. The two underpasses between Gopalpur traffic signal and Jagatpur bridge will save almost three kilometres of travel for the residents of Mukherjee Nagar, Gandhi Vihar, Jagatpur village and Sangam Vihar. The proposal was first approved in 2017 by UTTIPEC and also includes a subway near Gandhi Vihar on Outer Ring Road. “The casting of segments is completed and the excavation work for the vehicular underpass ramp is in progress. We plan to finish the project by the end of March,” said a PWD official overseeing the project. As per Master Plan Delhi 2021, a signal-free corridor was to be constructed between Vikaspuri and Wazirabad on the Outer Ring Road with the removal of the four traffic signals at Bhalswa, Mukundpur, Burari and Gopalpur and creation of flyovers. But the traffic signal at Gopalpur was brought down without providing an alternative arrangement because of which local residents were left to traverse 3km to cross the busy Outer Ring Road. According to PWD, several representations were received from the local people and residents’ welfare associations on optional arrangements to cross Outer Ring Road after the removal of the traffic signal resulted in additional travel distance for people. Also, a large number of students were road users given the place’s proximity to Mukherjee Nagar, an education hub. There was also a demand for a pedestrian bridge. However, PWD opted for the subway. In 2016, PWD proposed one subway and two half vehicular underpasses mainly for two wheelers and cyclists. These two underpasses will be partially above and below the existing road level because of the drain nearby. PWD is also constructing a footpath in these underpasses for the safe passage of the residents wishing to cross Outer Ring Road.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/2-underpasses-on-outer-ring-rd-to-cut-locals-travel-by-3km/articleshow/89211225.cms||Siddhanta mishra

Worn out roads, its buildings in ruins and mounds of rubble on what should have been a new bus stand and a fire station, Vasco is a decade behind Goa’s other urban pockets, according to its citizens. “Despite BJP’s promised double-engine development and the party’s decade-long hold over the constituency, Vasco has not seen much improvement,” a resident told TOI. With the state assembly elections slated for February 14, two powerhouses of the constituency -- Carlos Almeida and Krishna ‘Daji’ Salkar -- are set to cross swords again. However, in the battle for Vasco, the camps have changed. Almeida, this time on a Congress ticket, takes a shot at a new record for being the first Vasco MLA to win a third consecutive term. Salkar has his own point to prove to BJP. Unlike 2017, when BJP rejected Salkar and reposed its trust in Almeida, this time around the saffron party has put their faith in the former Mormugao Planning and Development Authority (MPDA) chairman. Every election brings Vasco’s haphazard development back into focus. There’s coal transportation, dust pollution, chaotic traffic and poor sanitation. For the last 10 years, the promised Kadamba bus stand project has been at a standstill, the critical fire station, demolished five years ago, operates from interim facilities and all plans to build a proper fish market have raised nothing but a stink. Post statehood, the voters of Vasco never gave any MLA a second consecutive term, but Almeida succeeded in creating a record with his re-election in 2017. Refused a ticket by BJP in 2017, Salkar had contested as an independent and lost by 1,351 votes. Locals say in a straight fight between BJP and Congress, Salkar and Almeida are evenly poised. However, with TMC fielding Saifullah Khan and with former Mormugao Municipal Council (MMC) chairperson and former Congress member Nandadeep Raut joining BJP, Salkar’s campaign has got a major fillip. Khan is the former chairman of Congress minority wing and ex-chairperson of the Mormugao Municipal Council, whose influence cannot be ignored. Raut, who was a contender for Congress ticket in Vasco, will also utilise his political clout to sway things against Almeida, who ironically was his political mentor. Noted Goan industrialist Narayan ‘Nana’ Bandekar, an influential voice in Vasco, and NCP state president Jose Philip D’Souza – now contesting from Dabolim -- could also play a key role in the elections. The constituency of Vasco has most number of voters among all the 40 constituencies with Hindus making up a large part of the voter base, followed by Christians and Muslims. The constituency also has a significant migrant population, predominantly in Mangor Hill, Gandhinagar, Shantinagar and Fakir Galli. The migrant voters, political observers say, will play a crucial role in determining whether Almeida scores a hat-trick or if Salkar becomes a lawmaker.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/goa/news/can-carlos-dodge-past-bjp-andscore-a-rare-hat-trick-in-vasco/articleshow/89214413.cms||Newton Sequeira

The constituency also has a significant migrant population, predominantly in Mangor Hill, Gandhinagar, Shantinagar and Fakir Galli. The migrant voters, political observers say, will play a crucial role in determining whether Almeida scores a hat-trick or if Salkar becomes a lawmaker.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/can-carlos-dodge-past-bjp-andscore-a-rare-hat-trick-in-vasco/articleshow/89210676.cms||Newton Sequeira

Both men and women will get a red t-shirt with blue jeans, cap, apron and a jersey for winters. The women employees will also have another uniform option of red saree with blue blouse. There are more than 2,000 employees working at the Indira rasoi in more than 350 outlets across Rajasthan who will be provided with two pairs of winter and two pairs of summer uniform every year. DLB Director Hridesh Kumar Sharma said, “We have decided to give a dress code to our Indira rasoi workers for a good impact. Every year we will bear a cost of Rs 1.5 crore to provide uniforms to employees working in 358 Indira Rasoi of the state. The state government has approved the proposal and very soon we will implement it.” Earlier, the Annapurna rasoi was run by a single contractor, but to break the monopoly, multiple contractors were pitched in. Currently, around 300 contractors run the Indira rasoi in Rajasthan. State Nodal officer of Indira rasoi, Naresh Goyal said that the public response for Indira Rasoi has been encouraging. “This is a good initiative that is helping the needy to get food at cheap rates. We take details of people dining at Indira rasoi and later a link to provide feedback for the rasoi is also provided to them. The uniform will give a unique identity to the employees who will work with more pride and respect,” said Goyal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/red-t-shirts-and-blue-jeans-for-indira-rasoi-staff-soon/articleshow/89212764.cms||---

Former CM Vasundhara Raje, BJP state president Satish Poonia, deputy leader of opposition Rajendra Singh Rathore are demanding CBI probe while the leader of opposition Gulab Chand Kataria has praised the Special Operations Group (SOG) for the ‘courageous’ investigation. “The CBI investigation into the REET paper leak case is the only option to bring justice to the candidates. The examination bodies shouldn’t be under doubt over their transparency, integrity, and neutrality. It is worrisome that investigating agencies have to put the Shiksha Sankul under their scanner for the paper leak,” said Raje. Pitching for the CBI inquiry, Poonia tweeted, “The sacked DP Jaroli has admitted that the real culprits are being shielded politically. It is also heard that people related to the Rajiv Gandhi study circle and one minister are under the scanner of the investigating agencies. Under the circumstances, a CBI inquiry is the only option.” Blaming the government for not bringing harsh legislation on paper leaks, Rathore tweeted, “Had you (CM Ashok Gehlot) passed the law on cheating, which you had earlier announced on October 17, it would have instilled a sense of fear among the cheating racketeers. Also, it would have prevented the examination bodies from facing embarrassment.” Going against the party line, Kataria said, “I congratulate the SOG for showing exemplary courage in investigating the case. It is an expression of their masculinity. It doesn’t matter whosoever does the investigation, important is that it must be time-bound. CBI is not the only investigating agency. What if the CBI takes a year to complete the investigation? Who will be responsible for the fate of 16 lakh candidates?” asked Kataria.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/raje-poonia-want-cbi-probe-kataria-praises-sog/articleshow/89212767.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Soon, law to nail goons who leak job exam papers: Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot||JAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Saturday said the state government would take the strictest action against every person found guilty of malpractices, lapses and dereliction of duty in the REET 2021 examination. He said injustice would not be done to any candidate who appeared in the examination. In a long tweet, Gehlot said the state government would bring a legislation in the upcoming assembly session on organised crime syndicates involved in leaking papers of competitive exams. Targeting opposition BJP, the chief minister said some people were trying to take political mileage and creating an environment so that no upcoming recruitment exam could take place in future. “Such people are playing with the future of lakhs of candidates,” he said. Gehlot said in many states, gangs are involved in paper leaks in an organised manner which is a matter of concern for all and it is necessary to investigate it deeply. The chief minister said the state government has given a free hand to the Special Operation Group (SOG) for investigation into the paper leak case and action is being taken on the basis of the information revealed in the probe. “Government employees who are found guilty of malpractices and dereliction of duty will be suspended immediately,” he added. He said a high-level committee under the chairmanship of a retired judge of the high court is being constituted to give suggestions regarding smooth and uninterrupted conduct of recruitment exams in future. The SOG has arrested several persons in the case so far. It recently arrested Ramkripal Meena and Udaram Vishnoi. Meena was employed by the district coordinator for the purpose of security of papers at Shiksha Sankul where the offices of the education department are located in Jaipur. Meena allegedly stole the paper from Shiksha Sankul and gave it to Udaram Vishnoi who is accused of circulating the paper. After it was confirmed that the paper was leaked from Shiksha Sankul, the role of the RBSE chairman, secretary, and other officers came under the scanner. Fixing responsibility, the chairman was sacked and the secretary suspended.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/soon-law-to-nail-goons-who-leak-job-exam-papers-cm/articleshow/89212768.cms||---

He said while the leader of opposition Gulab Chand Kataria is endorsing the SOG probe, his deputy Rajendra Rathore and party chief Satish Poonia are seeking a CBI probe. He said on BJP demand, many cases were recommended for CBI but so far the CBI has not even started investigation. He claimed that the chief minister and state government is serious about the paper leak case and various actions are being initiated to unearth the perpetrators of the crime. He advised the BJP leaders to stop the politics of conspiracy and first formulate its position in the party on the issue. He alleged that the opposition BJP is divided and every issue is being politicised. The Congress government wanted to bring out the truth and is holding a fair investigation and the perpetrators would be identified and punished, he claimed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/bjp-does-not-have-common-stand-cabinet-minister/articleshow/89212771.cms||---

In the tax advisory committee meeting, which was held virtually, industry representatives highlighted the systemic issues, high taxes and costly power among others. CII-Rajasthan in its representation said that as per MSME Act 2006, large scale units, public sector undertakings and government departments need to pay to MSMEs within 45 days of purchasing. Chairman of the industry body chairman Sanjay Saboo said, “Payments are piling up and industry needs this support at this critical time and all government and large scale units should strictly follow the MSME Act for payment within 45 days.” He said there was a notification issued by finance department in June, 2020 giving directions to government departments to pay the pending payments in next 15 days and to report to FD by 6 July. “Still most of the payments are stuck with PWD, JVVNL, AVVNL, JdVVNL, RSRDC, RSWC, Rajasthan Medical Corp Ltd, and medical department etc,” Saboo added. FICCI in its recommendations said high cross subsidy surcharge of Rs 1.94 a unit prevents industries to avail open access hiking their cost of operation. “Despite clear rationalisation in tariffs of HT consumers, as done by the RERC, the benefit doesn’t reflect in the value of CSS which is consistently increasing,” N K Jain of FICCI-Rajasthan, and Employers Association of Rajasthan, said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/cm-takes-tips-from-industry-bodies-for-budget-22-23/articleshow/89212772.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Real culprits are being shielded: RBSE chairman DP Jaroli||JAIPUR: A day after the state education department sacked Rajasthan Board of Secondary Education (RBSE) chairman DP Jaroli, the state government on Saturday suspended RAS officer and RBSE secretary Arvind Sengwa, commissioner of college education Subhash Yadav and a chemistry teacher posted in the administration cell of the board, BS Bairwa, following the police expose that the REET paper was leaked from the board strongroom. This has left the RBSE without the two most powerful officials barely a month before class 12 board exams begin. Jaroli was appointed as chairman for three years on February 20, 2021. Earlier in the day, Jaroli broke silence on his alleged involvement in the Rajasthan Eligibility Examination for Teachers (REET) paper leak. Speaking to reporters in Ajmer, he requested media to put his side of the story before chief minister Ashok Gehlot. He claimed that the real culprits were being shielded, but refused to say who was protecting them. A source said Jaroli had made a request to meet Gehlot, but got no response. “I will cooperate with the investigating agency till the matter is over,” said Jaroli. Replying to a query on whether SOG sleuths had questioned him, Jaroli said, “SOG personnel came to my office on Thursday to seek information related to the paper leak. They collected confidential data related to the exam and asked questions about the conducting process of the exam (conducted in September last year). I told them everything in detail.” On the appointment of private persons at key exam positions, Jaroli said all his actions were in accordance with the rules governing the position of RBSE chairman. “Those who were engaged (without taking anybody name) have the experience of holding exams. It is wrong to say they were inexperienced,” said Jaroli. On his sacking, Jaroli refused getting any message or order from the government. It is unclear whether Jaroli had come to Jaipur. TOI called him up for his reaction but got no response.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/real-culprits-are-being-shielded-asserts-axed-rbse-chairman-jaroli/articleshow/89212774.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Cops say only level-II paper held on September 26 was leaked||JAIPUR: Amid a growing chorus for scrapping the Rajasthan eligibility examination for teachers (REET), the state police have claimed that the cheating racket was involved only in the level-II exam, which was held on September 26 morning. The REET level-II was meant for recruiting teachers for upper primary, while level I was held for selecting primary teachers. According to the Rajasthan police’s current investigation status, only level-II paper was leaked. The police said that all their probes are focused on the irregularities that emerged during the morning shift of the level-II and they are taking information from the state education board for further investigation. The police clarified on Saturday that no case has been filed nor any investigation is underway for REET level-I. Rajasthan DGP, ML Lather said that REET Level I was completely safe. Meanwhile, till now, the Rajasthan police have arrested a total of 35 persons, including 13 students in the paper leak case that was first exposed in Sawai Madhopur. Sources in Rajasthan police said that the investigation agencies are making efforts to find out alleged beneficiaries of the leak scam so that they could be disqualified as per the norms. A team of the state police had also visited the Ajmer-based office of the education board to inspect the important REET documents, which are currently under examination. Rajasthan DGP, ML Lather had told TOI that Rajasthan police is carrying out a thorough investigation in the case. He also said that the people found guilty will not be spared and those who benefited from the cheating will face disqualification. The investigation picked up steam after the police, on Wednesday, arrested two persons Ramkripal Meena and Uda Ram Vishnoi. Meena is accused of stealing one REET paper from the envelope and had passed it on to Vishnoi on September 25, a day before the exam. As per the police, Meena, so far, has been paid Rs 1.22 crore for the paper theft. Police said that Vishnoi’s network is under the scanner to understand the scale of the paper leak and identify the people who benefited from it.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/cops-say-only-level-ii-paper-held-on-sept-26-was-leaked/articleshow/89212775.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Cops question REET district coordinator Pradeep Parashar in paper leak case||JAIPUR: Police on Saturday called Rajasthan Eligibility Examination for Teachers (REET) district coordinator Pradeep Parashar for questioning in the paper leak case. Parashar is suspected to have been present inside Shiksha Sankul on September 24 when Ramkripal Meena stole a question paper from an envelope. A day later, Meena handed over the questionnaire to another accused, Uda Ram Vishnoi, who gave it to other suspects in at least seven different locations across the state. Police arrested Meena and Vishnoi on Wednesday for their alleged involvement in stealing the paper and its eventual distribution. Investigation agencies then followed up leads on other persons who were posted at Shiksha Sankul that day when Parashar’s name cropped up. Sources in Rajasthan police informed TOI that Parashar could be arrested if his involvement is corroborated. Talking to TOI, DGP ML Lather said Parashar was quizzed by the agencies and investigation was underway. Axed RBSE chairman DP Jaroli on Saturday had claimed in Ajmer that he was not present inside Shiksha Sankul on September 24. Talking to reporters, he claimed that he had only deputed Parashar and did not know any of the accused arrested by police. Cops have yet not confirmed why Parashar, a private person, was made one of the coordinators of REET. Police believe that Parashar’s questioning could reveal who had roped in Meena at Shiksha Sankul, who later managed to gain access to the strongroom where papers were kept. Another important issue is the fate of the stolen paper. No one in Shiksha Sankul had raised an alarm about the missing paper from the envelope. “Parashar was brought for questioning. We will share details at a later stage,” said an official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/cops-question-reet-dist-coordinator-pradeep-parashar-in-paper-leak-case/articleshow/89212662.cms||---

The heart rate usually does not increase to that level even among persons who run for the first time on treadmill for 10 minutes, it may go up to 150-160 beats per minute. However, if a person continuously trains his heart by running on the treadmill, heartbeat goes down with each passing week. But, in case of the woman it is a disease for which she requires treatment. The doctors used a new technique, cryo-ablation, on the woman and provided her relief without surgery. At this high heart rate, there is always a possibility of brain stroke and heart failure. Abnormal increase in heart rate is a disease known as atrial fibrillation. The doctors provided her treatment through non-surgical cryo-ablation technique in 45 minutes. "Radiofrequency ablation techniques are commonly used in the treatment of atrial fibrillation, but due to the side effects and lack of accurate results, we decided to treat her with this new technique," said Dr Jitendra Singh Makkar, director and head of the department (cardiology) at a private hospital. The woman was suffering from uncontrolled heart palpitations and could not even sleep through the night. Dr Kush Kumar Bhagat, associate director, cardiology and electrophysiology, at the hospital said, "We performed cryo-ablation to restore her normal heart rhythm by disabling heart cells that create an irregular heartbeat. During this minimally invasive procedure, a thin flexible tube called a balloon catheter is used to locate and freeze the heart tissue that triggers an irregular heartbeat". The surgery was conducted at Eternal hospital.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/patient-with-abnormal-heart-rate-treated-without-surgery/articleshow/89212779.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Covid-19: 65% casualties among 60+ people in last one week in Rajasthan||JAIPUR: A recent analysis of the 108 Covid deaths from January 18-24, conducted by the health department, revealed that 65% deaths were among 60+ people, while 18.5% deaths occurred among 45-59 year olds and 35.2% among those below 45-year age groups. People with comorbidities were vulnerable as 80% of the people who died had underlying diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, heart and other chronic ailments. Earlier, experts anticipated that the third wave might affect children more but, as revealed in the health department’s figures, children in the 0-14 year age group seem to be the safest age group as only 3.7 per cent deaths of the state were reported among them. Dr Ajit Singh, superintendent, dedicated Covid RUHS hospital said, “Elderly persons are the most vulnerable group as they reported most deaths with many of them being immune compromised when they were brought to the hospital due to comorbidities. Also, many of them were unvaccinated and less protected against the virus.” Out of the 108 deaths reported from January 18-24, four were under 10 years, 14 were under the age bracket of 15-44 years, 20 were between 45 to 59 years, 43 were 60 to 74 years old and 27 were more than 75 years old. Though the number of deaths during the third Covid wave was not as high as in the second wave, still the state has been witnessing a marginal spike in Covid deaths. Doctors have attributed most of the deaths to comorbidities. “In the current wave, we are seeing majorly mild or moderate Covid cases and severe disease is mainly observed in persons with comorbidities or in some elderly. The major difference compared to the second wave is less hopitalisation despite the large number of persons being infected,” said Dr KK Sharma, senior consultant and head (pulmonary medicine) at a private hospital. Though the state is witnessing a current surge in Covid cases, the number of patients admitted to hospitals is significantly less as compared to the second wave. “Last year during the second wave peak, nearly all ICUs and beds were occupied in all the hospitals. While there is a rise in Covid infected people, hardly 5-7 per cent of the patients are admitted,” said Dr Ankit Bansal, consultant, pulmonology and critical care at a private hospital. According to the health department, the Omicron variant is now driving the Covid surge across the state. Doctors said that while the Delta variant was attacking the lungs, most cases now are related to the upper respiratory tract that is causing symptoms such as cold, cough, sore throat and fever.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/65-casualties-among-60-people-in-last-one-week/articleshow/89212781.cms||Syed Intishab Ali

He blackmailed her with photos and video clips, she alleged. Palada was expelled from BJP in 2020 for anti-party activities in local polls, Ajmer deputy mayor and senior BJP member Neeraj Jain said. The woman named 11 more people in her complaint, including an ASP-ranked officer and the politician’s staff. She alleged that the main accused and the others threatened her when she confronted him—warning that she would be implicated with false charges if she didn’t comply. She said she feared for her life because no official she approached offered any help, while the accused and his associates continued to threaten and blackmail her—allegedly with photos and video clips. A police officer said on Saturday that an investigation was launched after her FIR. The woman said an ASP had introduced her to the politician for a transfer she had sought and he visited her official quarters in Bhilwara on December 13, 2018, and raped her at gunpoint. When she told him she would inform the SP, he asked her to keep quiet and promised to marry her. The sub-inspector alleged that he never kept his promise, but continued to rape her at different places, including Jaipur in 2020 and Jodhpur in 2021. She had gone to those places for training. She accused the others of complicity in the crime.

Under the scheme, around 1.98 lakh youths will receive the increased unemployment allowance of Rs 4,000 and Rs 4,500 in the state. The employment department had earlier sent the file to the higher authorities for clearance on doing away with the dress code for beneficiaries of the scheme, which was earlier made mandatory. “The minister had asked us to remove the dress code for the beneficiaries,” said an official. The repackaged scheme mandates four-hour internship per day for five days a week at government offices or enterprises for jobless beneficiaries to avail the benefits of the scheme. As per the fresh guidelines for the scheme, the beneficiaries will stop getting the allowance if they discontinue internship. Under the new scheme, the unemployment allowance has been increased from Rs 3,500 to Rs 4,500 for girls, specially-abled persons and transgenders, and from Rs 3,000 to Rs 4,000 for boys. Now two lakh beneficiaries will be eligible for the scheme every year, which is an increase from 1.6 lakh until now. A beneficiary will be eligible for unemployment allowance for 2 years. If they don’t have any professional degree or diploma (for example: BEd, BTech, MBBS, BSc nursing, or BPharma), they will have to undertake skill training for three months conducted by RSLDC.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/over-42000-unemployed-youths-opted-for-internship/articleshow/89212783.cms||---
---||Mangaluru||Controversy erupts over forest official’s transfer||Mangaluru: The transfer of a range forest officer (RFO) attached to the forest mobile squad in Udupi has sparked a controversy in Dakshina Kannada. In this connection, MLA U T Khader has demanded that the vigilance squad of the forest department investigate the alleged cutting of hundreds of trees in the reserve forests of Belthangady taluk. He told the media here on Saturday, that a forest officer was transferred after the seizure of trees that were cut illegally. “The government should consider the case on illegal tree felling seriously, and order an investigation. Though more than 500 trees from reserve forests were felled, only 80 logs were found. Where did 420 trees go, and who is involved in this scam? We do not have faith in officials from the forest department in Dakshina Kannada. So a vigilance squad should conduct the investigation,” the Congress leader said, and urged all BJP MLAs from Dakshina Kannada and MP Nalin Kumar Kateel to put pressure on the government. National Environment Care Federation (NECF) state secretary Shashidhar Shetty said more than 380 trees had recently vanished from the deemed forest area in Belthangady. The officer had seized a truck and three persons from the forest department, including a watcher, were suspended. She was transferred after all these developments. “There are only a few sincere forest officers left in the forest department. Politicians are not letting them work. We will fight for the woman officer till she gets justice,” he said. Meanwhile, two letters have gone viral in connection with the transfer – one by Belthangady MLA Harish Poonja, in which he has requested the CM to transfer her, and the other letter, reportedly written by Sandhya to a Billava organisation, alleging that she was transferred due to political vendetta. To ascertain their veracity, the officer was not available for comments. MLA Poonja has refused to comment on the issue. The officer, who hails from Belthangady, was recently transferred to the Forest Training Institute in Bidar.

The girl approached her school principal who in turn contacted the child panel following which the wedding was prevented. Apparently the girl’s elder sister was to get married and the parents decided to get the younger one married off at the same time. Rajasthan state commission for protection of child rights chairperson Sangeeta Beniwal said, “On Friday evening, I was told that the girl, who is around 12-13 years old, was to get married to a boy who is around 18 years old. Her parents wanted both the daughters to get married at the same time and the girl told her school principal about it. As soon as I was informed, I directed police and the district administration to ensure that the child marriage does not take place.” Officials claimed that children themselves are now more aware and coming forward to stop their own child marriages. Last year in November, a 19-year-old boy had sought help from the state child commission to get his wedding, which was scheduled for November 29, stopped. The legal age for boys to get married is 21. The boy hails from Dausa and wanted to study further.This was the first case where a boy stopped his own wedding. Around the same time there were numerous cases from Udaipur, Chittorgarh and Jodhpur where minor girls stopped their child marriages.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/minor-girl-seeks-help-of-panel-to-stop-marriage/articleshow/89212784.cms||Yeshika Budhwar

The disability court made these remarks after the panchayati raj department gave a reply to it that there is no provision in the panchayati raj act to nominate specially-abled persons as members. “After this reply, the disability court directed them to amend the Act and do it on a similar pattern as Chhattisgarh,” said Hemant Bhai Goyal, national vice president, Divyang Adhikar Mahasangh.The Centre had earlier directed all states and union territories, including Rajasthan, to nominate differently-abled persons to various posts in panchayati raj and urban local bodies. The directions came following a petition filed in this regard by Hemant Bhai Goyal. In Rajasthan, the state government had already nominated specially-abled persons in the urban local bodies, but it is yet to take a decision on panchayati raj institutions. The state government had amended the Rajasthan Municipal Act last year to introduce this provision of nominating PwDs to the ULBs as members, making it the first in the country.After amendments in the Rajasthan Municipal Act, now it has become mandatory to keep one post vacant for PwDs in an urban local body.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/amend-act-to-nominate-disabled-on-cgarh-line/articleshow/89212786.cms||---

But there are thousands who place online bets on these games. And the bookies, operating from Dubai, have hired ‘watchdogs’ from the city to keep an eye on bets placed on these matches. The turnover of the betting racket can be gauged from the salary, which goes up to Rs 40,000 per month, that those hired at different locations get from the Dubai-based operators. Police arrested one such man from the city on Friday. The arrested accused has been identified as 26-year-old Hardik Gajjar while the cops booked nine others for allegedly running the gambling racket.

They keep watch on the entire operations while several young men like Gajjar are hired at multiple locations to keep watch on specific games,” said a police officer.Gajjar was hired to keep a watch on football and tennis matches. Gajjar was supposed to alert his employers if he noticed any cheating in betting by any member. A college dropout, Gajjar, was paid Rs 37,500 salary. He kept watch on the betting through a mobile application from two mobile phones. He used to login in the applications and websites through multiple IDs created by the operators of the racket.Gajjar informed police that Amit Gujarat and Alpesh Prajapati are the two other employees based in Gujarat and they performed similar duties. The accused accepted bets on cricket and Kabaddi as well.Police recovered valuables worth Rs 29,900 including two mobile phones, a laptop and cash from the accused.

In this connection, MLA U T Khader has demanded that the vigilance squad of the forest department investigate the alleged cutting of hundreds of trees in the reserve forests of Belthangady taluk.He told the media here on Saturday, that a forest officer was transferred after the seizure of trees that were cut illegally. “The government should consider the case on illegal tree felling seriously, and order an investigation. Though more than 500 trees from reserve forests were felled, only 80 logs were found. Where did 420 trees go, and who is involved in this scam? We do not have faith in officials from the forest department in Dakshina Kannada. So a vigilance squad should conduct the investigation,” the Congress leader said, and urged all BJP MLAs from Dakshina Kannada and MP Nalin Kumar Kateel to put pressure on the government.National Environment Care Federation (NECF) state secretary Shashidhar Shetty said more than 380 trees had recently vanished from the deemed forest area in Belthangady. The officer had seized a truck and three persons from the forest department, including a watcher, were suspended. She was transferred after all these developments. “There are only a few sincere forest officers left in the forest department. Politicians are not letting them work. We will fight for the woman officer till she gets justice,” he said. Meanwhile, two letters have gone viral in connection with the transfer – one by Belthangady MLA Harish Poonja, in which he has requested the CM to transfer her, and the other letter, reportedly written by Sandhya to a Billava organisation, alleging that she was transferred due to political vendetta. To ascertain their veracity, the officer was not available for comments. MLA Poonja has refused to comment on the issue. The officer, who hails from Belthangady, was recently transferred to the Forest Training Institute in Bidar. Forest department sources said the officer was transferred after she submitted a report on illegal tree cutting. It is now learnt that her transfer has been withheld.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/controversy-erupts-over-forest-officers-transfer/articleshow/89212794.cms||---

Co-convener of Bajrang Dal’s Dakshina Kannada district unit Guruprasad Ullal said that they had submitted a memorandum to the Ullal City Municipal Council (CMC), demanding the change in the road’s nomenclature.Pointing out that Rani Abbakka’s valour was celebrated by people, cutting across lines of religion, Guruprasad said, “The district administration must consider the demand seriously, and issue appropriate directions to the Ullal CMC.”To a query on a banner that indirectly banned people from other faiths from conducting business during the festival at Ullalabailu Daivasthana in Ullal, he said that it was intended only for Hindus. “We have put up banners requesting Hindus, who have no faith in religion, gods and those who engage in desecrating and insulting Hindu gods, not to conduct business there.

As per the data available, in 2020, MIA welcomed 5,40,928 passengers, which rose to 7,72,555 in 2021, a whopping growth of 70%. With this growth, MIA, the second busiest in the state after Kempegowda International Airport, has been able to get back to traffic levels as it was before the pandemic. “The growth would have been more positive if not for the pandemic, which almost grounded the aviation sector in the last two years. The growth at MIA, in terms of domestic passengers or flights has been tremendous. It will bounce back further, once Covid-19 is over,” said a senior official of a leading aircraft carrier, who added that domestic passenger traffic will shoot up again in a few days. “A lot of air travellers who couldn’t travel in 2020 due to travel restrictions, started to fly to various tourist destinations in 2021. There was revenge tourism, and as a result, there is an upward growth in the domestic industry. The growth is likely to continue in the coming days,” the official expressed. Currently, four airlines operate domestically, and connect to various cities of India. Among them, Indigo tops the list, with the highest domestic flights operations. “After the second wave of the pandemic, the domestic flights at MIA started to pick up, starting from August. In October, MIA saw 781 domestic flights operations, which increased to 798 in November, and jumped to 953 in December. This is a sign that there is a robust growth of the domestic airline market,” said an executive. An executive of a low-cost airline said that domestic flights saw a negative growth soon after the new year began. However, it is improving except for night flights. “From past three days, the passenger load has been good. The flights to Bengaluru and Mumbai are running at full capacity. People are now not worried about the new Covid-19 variant, since it has mild symptoms, which has led to an increase in the movement of domestic passengers. The only issue they have, is to produce a negative RT-PCR report while boarding,” added the executive.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/mluru-airport-sees-70-growth-in-domestic-passenger-traffic/articleshow/89212805.cms||Kevin Mendonsa
---||Mangaluru||Aviation sector may gain if Shiradi Ghat national highway closes for 6 months||MANGALURU: Even as the proposed closure of the Shiradi Ghat stretch of national highway for six months has upset stakeholders, the aviation sector may be benefited by this development. According to aviation industry stakeholders, the closure of the ghat section for six months will result in travellers avoiding roads and taking flights to Bengaluru. The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has proposed closing the Shiradi Ghat stretch of national highway completely for six months, in order to make a four-lane road from Donigal, on the outskirts of Sakleshpur, to Maranahalli, a distance of 220 km to 230km. “With this proposed closure, we are expecting that the demand for domestic flights from Mangaluru to Bengaluru will increase, since not many people would want to take a long route to reach the state capital,” said an executive of a low-cost airline. Currently, 10 flights are being operated per day on the Bengaluru-Mangaluru sector. For the time-being while an airline has cancelled a flight to Bengaluru due to poor passenger load, another carrier operates only night flights. “We have observed that the passenger load to Bengaluru is slowly picking up. There is no advance booking, but tickets are booked two days prior to the journey. Most of the travellers fly on personal visits, such as weddings and other similar engagements. There are few corporate bookings. The airlines are also expecting a surge in bookings, starting with the onset of summer,” said an executive. According to a KSRTC Volvo bus driver, if the work commences after the closure of the Shiradi Ghat stretch, Airavat (Volvo) and other buses will ply via Mangaluru-Madikeri-Holenarasipura-Bengaluru or Mangaluru-Madikeri-Mysuru-Bengaluru routes. Cars and other smaller vehicles can traverse through Charmadi Ghat. There is also fear of landslides in these ghat sections during the rainy season, which causes the stretch to get blocked.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/aviation-sector-may-gain-if-shiradi-ghat-national-highway-closes-for-6-months/articleshow/89212806.cms||---

Lobo said that it was a tragedy on the part of the judge who had studied the Constitution and used the same while delivering justice to be engaged in such an act. “It is an insult to the Constitution of India and also an unpardonable mistake. Who will protect the Constitution when such instances are reported? The high court and the Supreme Court should ensure that such incidents of disrespect to Ambedkar do not recur in future,” Lobo said. MLC Kumar stated the judge’s act has hurt people who have faith in the Constitution. “Public has the highest respect for the judiciary, and we are confident that the Supreme Court will consider the issue seriously. The incident was not just an insult to Ambedkar, but also to the country’s democratic system,” he added.

---||Goa||In Goa’s only reserved constituency, voters set to choose one of their own||Pernem has a lot at stake as it goes to polls on February 14. It is the state’s only reserved constituency, set aside for Scheduled Caste candidates. Ever since Dhargalim was merged to create a single constituency of Pernem in 2012, the region has not seen a local serving as its MLA. Manohar Ajgaonkar, who won the 2017 elections on MGP ticket, is a resident of Margao, while BJP’s Rajendra Arlekar (elected in 2012) -- now governor of Himachal Pradesh -- is a native of Vasco. This time around, the battle for the Pernem seat is expected to be a two-pronged fight between Pravin Arlekar (BJP) and Rajan Korgaonkar (MGP), according to observers. While Korgaonkar is a native of Pernem, Arlekar (originally residing at Calangute) has shifted base in recent years to Pernem. Congress candidate Jitendera Gaonkar is also a niz Pednekar. “In the run-up to the elections, the discussion has been all about picking the right candidate who will ensure that the constituents benefit from developmental projects which are coming up here,” a local, who did not wish to be identified, said. From the Mopa international airport to the all India ayurveda institute, many major projects are under construction in the largely rural constituency. The projects are set to change the face of Pernem over the next few years. So, who can take Pernem and these projects forward? Political observers and many locals believe it is a fight between Arlekar and Korgaonkar, or rather BJP and MGP. “BJP has a good organisational set up in Pernem and Arlekar will benefit,” said another observer. “There was pressure on BJP from Korgaonkar’s supporters to grant him the party ticket. But as Arlekar managed to get it, Korgaonkar’s best option was to take MGP's offer for a ticket, as the party has a strong base in Pernem.” Arlekar was originally MGP’s candidate, until he joined BJP. MGP then settled for Korgaonkar and believe he has a good chance of retaining the seat they won in 2017 and have traditionally dominated. Jitendra Gaonkar (Congress), Pundalik Dhargalkar (Aam Aadmi Party) and Sujay Mhapsekar (Revolutionary Goans) are also contesting from here, but observers believe they may not be in a position to upset calculations of Arlekar and Korgaonkar. While RG’s Mhapsekar is a green-horn, AAP’s Dhargalkar could barely poll 350 votes at the recent zilla panchayat polls. Congress candidate Gaonkar, a lawyer by profession, is known to provide free legal aid to locals, but a delay in the party finalising its candidate meant Korgaonkar and Arlekar had a head start. Constituents here feel that while ‘developmental’ works have been taken up in Pernem, the renovation of temples and beautification of gardens have not really helped address their real issues like the lack of health care facilities and an almost non-existent public transport system. As Pernem goes to polls for the first time since 1999 without Ajgaonkar in the fray, it remains to be seen if these developmental and identity issues have any real bearing on the results.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/in-goas-only-reserved-constituency-voters-set-to-choose-one-of-their-own/articleshow/89210678.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar
---||---||In Goa’s only reserved constituency, voters set to choose one of their own||Pernem has a lot at stake as it goes to polls on February 14. It is the state’s only reserved constituency, set aside for Scheduled Caste candidates. Ever since Dhargalim was merged to create a single constituency of Pernem in 2012, the region has not seen a local serving as its MLA. Manohar Ajgaonkar, who won the 2017 elections on MGP ticket, is a resident of Margao, while BJP’s Rajendra Arlekar (elected in 2012) -- now governor of Himachal Pradesh -- is a native of Vasco. This time around, the battle for the Pernem seat is expected to be a two-pronged fight between Pravin Arlekar (BJP) and Rajan Korgaonkar (MGP), according to observers. While Korgaonkar is a native of Pernem, Arlekar (originally residing at Calangute) has shifted base in recent years to Pernem. Congress candidate Jitendera Gaonkar is also a niz Pednekar. “In the run-up to the elections, the discussion has been all about picking the right candidate who will ensure that the constituents benefit from developmental projects which are coming up here,” a local, who did not wish to be identified, said. From the Mopa international airport to the all India ayurveda institute, many major projects are under construction in the largely rural constituency. The projects are set to change the face of Pernem over the next few years. So, who can take Pernem and these projects forward? Political observers and many locals believe it is a fight between Arlekar and Korgaonkar, or rather BJP and MGP. “BJP has a good organisational set up in Pernem and Arlekar will benefit,” said another observer. “There was pressure on BJP from Korgaonkar’s supporters to grant him the party ticket.

We ask BJP, what nefarious thoughts have you housed in your minds? How much theft have you committed? What information are you hiding from the public?” said AAP MLA Saurabh Bharadwaj. BJP functionaries put up their hoardings for free on unauthorised sites, toilets and street furniture, AAP claimed. “It is because of them that the corporation is in dire straits. They have hijacked the whole of Delhi with their hoardings,” added Bharadwaj. BJP has, however, said that the decision of the south corporation is “logically correct”. “When the Arvind Kejriwal government is not implementing the 4th and 5th Delhi Finance Commission recommendations on funds for the corporations which it has accepted in the Delhi assembly, how does it expect the corporations to reply to that assembly’s queries. When the government does not respect the assembly, then how does it expect the south corporation to answer the politically motivated questions on hoardings raised there,” said Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/aap-targets-sdmc-over-assembly-query/articleshow/89211855.cms||---

But going by the news reports about the safety of children even in case of infection, we have decided to allow our children to go to the school,” said Sachin Jamadar, one of the parents.The children in rural areas also have started attending schools where the numbers rose from 2.1 lakh to 2.9 lakh. The school authorities believe that the major impediment now in the children attending schools is the bus service. “In remote areas, the students are given travel concessions, and girl students are allowed to travel free of cost to and back schools. Due to ongoing strike, this is affecting the children’s movement, and hence the attendance in the schools is limited,” the officer added.2,338 cases reported in Nashik dist on SaturdayThe Nashik district on Saturday registered 2,338 new cases after it touched the highest 2,944 on January 25. Meanwhile, 2,410 people have been discharged from the hospital, which resulted in a marginal drop in the active cases by 72. The city registered 1,451 fresh cases on Saturday, while Nashik rural recorded 771 cases.

Dr Bapusaheb Nagargoje, the civic body’s medical superintendent, told TOI, “We are optimistic that the declining trend of the curve in Nashik city would begin within the next seven to 10 days.” However, he warned people against lowering their guard against Covid as the scenario could change if people get lax in adhering to the Covid safety protocols. According to him, for over a week now, the number of active cases in the city has been hovering around the 10,500-11,300 mark. On some days during this period, the daily recoveries outnumbered the daily positive cases. “During this third wave, which started in the first week of January, hospitalisation of the patients has been significantly low when compared to the first two waves of the pandemic. The hospitalisation has been less than 4% of the total active cases. Even the case fatality rate is on the lower side,” said Nagargoje. At present, at NMC-managed Bytco and Zakir Hussain hospitals the total number of admissions for Covid treatment is around 100. “Currently, we have 25 Covid patients on ventilator and most of them have comorbidities,” said NMC’s health department chief. NMC insiders admitted that a section of the people in the city are resorting to self-testing as kits are available in the market and getting treated by private medical practitioners. These patients are mostly asymptomatic or have mild symptoms which do not require hospitalisation.  “The virus in the third wave is much more infectious than what we had witnessed in the first and second waves. There are examples in the city where entire families were infected after one member contracted Covid. But the virus in the current wave is not that virulent like in the previous two waves,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/covid-curve-in-nashik-city-has-flattened-civic-body/articleshow/89212814.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

The flow of tourists had stopped completely since December 15 last year, following the third wave of the pandemic. However, over the past one week, a few tourists have started making bookings, especially for weekends, said the hoteliers. There are around 40 hotels and resorts in Igatpuri, which is a well-known hill station. Tourists from across the state, especially from Mumbai and Pune, visit the town to enjoy the scenic surroundings. As the Covid cases started dropping in October and November, things were returning to normalcy, but the cases once again started rising affecting the hospitality business in Igatpuri.Vishal Gupta, the owner of Sai Plaza hotel in Igatpuri, said, “The increasing cases and the restrictions that were imposed once again had stopped the flow of tourists to Igatpuri after December 15. The overall vehicular traffic on the Mumbai-Agra highway that passes through Igatpuri had come down to a great extent. This continued till January 15. Things have started picking up slowly.” Gupta said that apart from sight-seeing, people from Mumbai, Pune and other parts of the state also book hotels and resorts for wedding ceremonies. He said that though restrictions are still in place and hoteliers are following all the norms, they have started getting some bookings. SDPO Arjun Bhosale said they were ensuring that the people do not visit the tourist spots in the Igatpuri and Ghoti owing to the restrictions last month. At the same time, there were restrictions for wedding events also. As per the guidelines for marriage functions, the total number of attendees at weddings should not exceed 100 for enclosed spaces (like banquet and marriage halls, etc) and 250 for open places or as per 25% of the seating capacity.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/hoteliers-relieved-as-tourism-picks-up-in-igatpuri-with-drop-in-covid-19-cases/articleshow/89212815.cms||---

There have been innumerable accidents where the helmets have saved lives of the bikers.”PI Pawar said they are witnessing a change all over the city. “At times, we have to wait a long while before we find a biker without a helmet so that he/she could be penalized. This is a good sign,”he said.Meanwhile, ACP Seetaram Gaikwad said the drive would now be a continuous exercise.

---||Allahabad||Seers at Mela want India to be declared a Hindu nation||Prayagraj: Scores of seers and saints camping at Magh Mela on the sandy banks of the river Ganga here on Saturday raised a demand for declaring India a Hindu nation, treating Subhash Chandra Bose as the first Prime Minister of the country and capital punishment for conversion which should be treated as treason.Besides, patriotic Muslims were declared to be part of the family and a decision to intensify their ‘homecoming’ campaign was also taken by seers at the Sant Sammelan organised by the steering committee of Dharma Sansad at the Brahmarshi Ashram camp located on Mahavir Marg of the Mela.Chief guest of the sammelan, Sumeru Peethadheeshwar Jagadguru Swami Narendranand Saraswati, said: “The government may not declare India as a Hindu nation, but all Hindus should start writing and terming the country a Hindu Rashtra. By doing so, the government would be compelled to declare the country a Hindu nation.”He further said, “Islamic jihad is a big threat to the humanity and the world. To crush it, the policy of China will have to be adopted and it can be stopped by imposing sanctions as China has done. Sanatani are the target of everyone and for this, it is necessary that the system of equal education and equal justice is implemented in the country.”He also demanded that there is a need to end government takeover of Hindu monasteries and temples. “If monasteries and temples are being acquired by the government, then mosques and churches should also be acquired,” he added.Jagadguru said that “Muslims are not a minority and action should be taken to withdraw their minority status”. “The life of revolutionaries like Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev should be included in the curriculum of schools. Provision should be made for capital punishment by keeping conversion in the category of treason.”Mahamandaleshwar Annapurna Bharti of Niranjani Akhara said that “when religious leaders spoke some words for their safety in Haridwar’s Dharma Sansad, they were put in jail. It was said that this has hurt the sentiments of the people of a particular religion, but when Tauqeer Raza gathered a crowd of 20,000 in Bareilly and spewed poison against Sanatan Dharma, no action was taken. Did it not hurt our sentiments? Owaisi’s threatening video is released but no action has been taken”.She appealed to the saints and devotees present in the Mela to write a letter to the government for the release of Mahamandaleshwar Narasimhanand Yeti and Jitendra Narayan Singh Tyagi (former name Wasim Rizvi).Shakti Peethadhishwar Swami Lalitananda said that every child is a Hindu by birth. “Later, his rituals changed. We have left our culture only then others are adopting it.”Jagadguru Krishnaacharya emphasized the unity of the saints.Swami Anand Swarup said that at the time of partition of the country, there were nine crore Muslims, but today their population is about 40 crores. He alleged that there is pressure to stop Sant Sammelan.Swami Sindhu Sagar said that Hindus have no hatred towards Muslims and Muslims like Dr APJ Abdul Kalam are respected.Mahamandaleshwar Yatindranand Giri, who presided over the sammelan, said that Lord Krishna was born in jail. “If the doors of the jail are opening for the saints, then understand that we have succeeded in our objective. “Mmost of the Muslims of India are Hindus and were forced to convert. The blood of Hindus and Muslims is one”.In the Sant Sammelan, an appeal was made to the Hindus to be united by being free from the shackles of caste and class.Jagadguru Swami Narendranand Saraswati said, “There can be no father of the nation. There can be the son of the nation, but not the father of the nation. The first Prime Minister of the country was Subhash Chandra Bose, his leadership was accepted by many countries. In such a situation, he should be declared the first Prime Minister of the country. Historians have presented wrong facts before the countrymen, due to which today’s generation is confused.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/seers-at-mela-want-india-to-be-declared-a-hindu-nation/articleshow/89212823.cms||---

---||Allahabad||Hardik Patel, other Cong leaders denied permission to hold event||Prayagraj: Senior leaders of the Congress party, NSUI and Youth Congress were denied permission to hold an event at Sardar Patel Seva Sansthan in Alopibagh locality of the city on Saturday. The police also denied permission to Gujarat Congress working president and Patidar leader Hardik Patel to address the event. A large number of policemen were stationed near the venue to prevent the event from being held as scheduled.Hardik Patel along with Youth Congress national president Srinivas BV and National Student Union of India (NSUI) national president Neeraj Kundan were to attend the function and address youth in the city. The event was part of the state Congress committee’s planned ‘Youth Parliaments’ to be held across the state in the run up to the assembly polls 2022.Under it, the youth were to be made aware of the ‘Youth Manifesto’ announced by the party. Patel was to attend the event in Prayagraj on January 29 and in Varanasi on January 30 followed by Meerut on January 31 while Alka Lamba and Kanhaiya Kumar were to attend the event in Lucknow on February 1 and Imran Pratapgarhi in Kanpur on February 3.As per plan, Hardik along with the Srinivas BV and Neeraj Kundan arrived at the Patel Seva Sansthan from Bamrauli airport but were informed by the district administration and police officials that the permission for the event had been denied. After some time, the leaders left the site, said SP City Dinesh Singh.After some argument, the leaders then proceeded for Chota Baghada, one of the localities where the police is accused of having barged into lodges housing students and youngsters preparing for competitive exams and assaulted them on January 25 after a violent protest by a large group of RRB NTPC recruitment exam aspirants who were unhappy over short-listing of candidates for second phase of the exam. Many youngsters had sustained injuries in the police action at lodges which led to the suspension of six policemen including an inspector and two sub-inspectors.When the police prevented Hardik and other NSUI leaders from entering the Chota Baghada locality, they headed towards the local Congress office on Zero Road. The leaders then undertook house-to-house campaigning in Allahabad South assembly constituency.Addressing media persons at the gates of Patel Seva Sansthan, Hardik said, “At the behest of the state government, I am being stopped from raising issues of the youth and unemployed. This is happening when the poll related events of the leaders of the ruling party are being allowed every day. They are claiming that they do not have adequate police force for the event. Strangely, this is what we are fighting for as we want youngsters to get jobs so that there are an adequate number of policemen.”Later, in a tweet while still in Prayagraj, Hardik added: “I went to Prayagraj in UP to strengthen the voice of the youth, but on the behest of the BJP, the police stopped me. Today the police did not allow the youth parliament programme organized under the ‘recruitment legislation’ to be held and threatened the students. Efforts are being done to suppress the voice of the youth.”State president of NSUI, Uttar Pradesh, Akhilesh Yadav said, “It is shameful that the district administration used all its power and force to prevent Congress leaders from meeting and interacting with the youth.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/hardik-patel-other-cong-leaders-denied-permission-to-hold-event/articleshow/89212827.cms||---

The former CM appealed to both the state and central governments to offer land and disburse compensation to the owners of these houses, so they could relocate to other places, thereby ensuring adequate buffer space for the temples and their property. Shettar on Saturday took stock of the work being undertaken as part of the renovation of the historic Chandramouleshwar temple in Unkal and the Banashankari temple at Amargol in Hubballi. After completing his tour of inspection, Shettar said, “The government has taken steps to develop basic facilities at these historic temples, including the Chandramouleshwara temple, which dates back to the 11th century by the kings of the Chalukya dynasty. These temples were in a sorry state owing to the lack of basic infrastructure. Now, the department of archaeology has taken steps to ensure that these temples are equipped with basic facilities. Work is also under way on construction of compound walls, development of gardens, et al. Security personnel will be deployed at these shrines, and facilities will be provided for the convenience of tourists.” Shettar said that he had instructed officials of the Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation, the departments of revenue and archaeology, to conduct a survey of the temples, and submit a report on their condition at the earliest.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/govt-must-offer-land-to-shift-houses-near-historic-temples/articleshow/89212829.cms||---

The viral video shows a patient lying on a bed on one side, while doctors are playing a video game on a PC on another side. The issue has been brought to the notice of the hospital authorities. A patient from Vagga was brought to the hospital with a head injury on January 23. Sharing the video of the patient and doctors, Umesh Acharya wrote on Facebook, “A patient from Mulkaje in Vagga was taken to Wenlock District Hospital at 11 pm on January 23 after he had head injuries due to high blood pressure. Doctors and staff at the hospital have shown arrogance and they were playing game on the computer. They did not respond even when the patient’s relatives requested them to attend.” Acharya requested the district administration to take necessary action in connection with the incident. Wenlock District Hospital medical superintendent Dr Sadashiva Shanbag told TOI that the issue has been brought to the notice of the KMC Hospital authorities. “The incident was reported in the casualty area. Some postgraduate students from KMC Hospital have switched on the TV or other gadget,” he said. Meanwhile, a PG student has been issued a warning and suspended by the college management.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/clip-of-doctors-playing-video-games-at-wenlock-goes-viral/articleshow/89209716.cms||---

Senior academics say almost all these kids come from poor socio-economic backgrounds and do not have access to online infrastructure, which in turn has deprived them of quality education since the last two years. Sundip Gaikwad, principal of Mecosabagh Methodist Marathi High School, said, “The last time they attended school in normal condition was when they were in Std VIII. Then followed a series of school closures due to the devastating Covid outbreak and for these students online classes are easily accessible. This two-year learning gap will be detrimental for them in the upcoming board exams.” While schools were ‘always online’ as per government rules, the fact is that an overwhelming majority of students could not even attend it. Primary reason for that was access to digital learning platforms. Zafar Khan, former president of Urdu Schools’ Association, said, “Many come from poor families and do not have smartphones that are required for online learning. Even if someone gets access to smartphone then there is a question of recharging it. Over 75% of students fall under this category, so now you can imagine the learning deficit.” Khan, who currently heads the School Headmasters’ Charitable Trust, hopes the government approves special funds to provide such students access to digital learning infrastructure. Ashok Gavhankar, principal of Marathi-medium Raosheb Thawre High School feels that students are being set up for the toughest test of their academic career. “Those currently in XII at least got almost uninterrupted schooling till Std X, but the ones due to appear for SSC now have never faced such an examination. In a normal school year, they are prepared for this through multiple written tests in school followed by the big one which we call prelims. All these together prepare them for non-stop three-hour writing marathons,” said Gavhankar. He added that with two valuable years of practice gone, the academic performance in SSC will be hit. A senior principal said the state education board will now need to show a tacit understanding by either setting an easy paper or turning a blind eye towards lenient marking. “If students are not prepared, there is no other option,” she said, not wishing to be identified. “An easy question paper still is no guarantee that students will fare well. With lenient marking and internal marks, we can at least carry the students till the passing marks line,” the principal added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/school-closure-vernacular-students-face-tough-board-exam/articleshow/89210686.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

We don’t want anyone to misuse the policy as there is a subsidy given by the government on electric vehicles (EV) and their charging stations; hence, there will be an annual fee,” said an official. According to the proposal, a charging station can be set up after paying Rs 24,000 as the annual fee. A minimum area of 40 square metres is required to operate a station. “After the policy is passed, applications can be filed online with the required documents to obtain permission from the corporation,” added the official. Currently, such charging stations are set up only at corporation-operated parking lots. The corporation aims to provide battery charging stations at every two square kilometres to provide ample options. SDMC itself has also identified more than 200 locations feasible for setting up these stations, which will be made operational soon.  Delhi government is providing attractive purchase incentives across e-vehicle segments, like zero registration fees and road tax waivers at the time of purchase, to make the cost of owning and operating EVs affordable.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/sdmc-to-get-private-players-for-more-ev-charging-stns/articleshow/89211299.cms||Siddhanta mishra

In the letter to the SP, the employees of the educational institutions run by the Trust, said that a few individuals not associated with the establishment barged into the offices in Dharwad and Mugad, and ransacked them.The staff filed a complaint at the Dharwad rural police station immediately after the incident, but lack of any effective action by cops at the station compelled them to escalate the issue to the SP, the letter stated. Sarvodaya Shikshana Trust is managed by a committee headed by chairman of Karnataka legislative council and former minister Basavaraj Horatti. Meanwhile, there are legal disputes pertaining over the management of the institutions run by the Trust between groups headed by Horatti and senior Congress leader and former minister Satish Jarkiholi.On January 25, Mohan Gudasalamani, president of district Walmiki Samaj Sangha had lodged a complaint alleging that at Horatti’s behest five others had assaulted him and other members of his team at the school. Dharwad rural police subsequently filed an FIR against Horatti and five others, and made a submission to the court online. The local court, however, transferred the case against Horatti to a special court in Bengaluru, set up to deal with complaints against elected representatives.SP Krishnakant did not respond to queries by the media on why no action was taken on the complaint filed by the headmistress of the Trust’s school in Mugad against Gudasalamani and others who had barged into the school and ransacked the offices while FIR was filed against the accused based on the complaint by Gudasalamani which was lodged much later.I was in Bengaluru on the day in question: HorattiSpeaking to Sunday Times of India from Bengaluru, Horatti wondered how the police registered FIR against him when he was in Bengaluru on the day the alleged incident took place. “Chief Minister Bommai and Home Minister Araga Jnanendra have spoken to me about the case and let us see what happens next” Horatti said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/teachers-of-sarvodaya-trust-write-to-sp-seeking-protection/articleshow/89212835.cms||---

Speaking to reporters here on Saturday, Sriramulu said Congress leaders are lying by saying 10-20 BJP MLAs are in touch with them. “As they are already disappointed after the defeats in recent elections, they are making such baseless statements. In Goa, they are telling another lie that BJP ministers who had quit Congress to bring BJP to power in Karnataka, are in their contact. It’s their illusion of resuming to power in the state. Congress is already rejected in many states and is losing its base in the country,” he said. He added that Congress is taking MLA Pritam Gowda’s name, which is also lie. “They have cheated CM Ibrahim, a senior leader, who is capable to hold posts like leader of opposition. One should note that Congree never encourages minority leaders, but it will use them to get Muslim votes and forgets them after getting to power. Claiming himself as Ahinda leader, Siddaramaiah has stabbed Ibrahimin the back,” he said. When asked about Siddaramaiah’s candidature in the next assembly election, Sriramulu sarcastically said, “Let Siddaramaiah be called by the people of five – six constituencies and contest everywhere.” He expressed confidence of BJP winning in all five northern states where assembly polls will be held in February and March.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/sriramulu-dismisses-congress-leaders-claims-on-bjp-legislators-jumping-ship/articleshow/89212836.cms||---

Books at the Public Central Library in Dharwad , which was a veritable paradise for bibliophiles, too have been digitised, and uploaded on the app’s database. Furthermore, readers in Dharwad have taken to the new avatar of the library with gusto – nearly 1.5 lakh readers who have registered on the app, called the e-Sarvajanik Granthalaya, are from the North Karnataka district.The app was launched by then minister for primary and secondary education S Suresh Kumar in February 2020. In all, there are 272 public libraries across Karnataka, and thus far, the app has been downloaded by 2.5 crore readers. The cloud-based resource offers readers access to books in English, Kannada, Urdu and Marathi, in addition to the latest copies of magazines and newspapers.Deputy director of the department of libraries MB Karigar told TOI, “There are three digital libraries in the twin cities, where we have installed computers and tablets to allow readers to access books on the database. So far, the government has disbursed funds for six computers, and 12 tablets. With schools and colleges remaining closed owing to the lockdown, there was much demand from readers that they be granted access to the soft copies of the books. Students were among those who used the e-library facility extensively.”Karigar is elated that the department’s initiative to ensure readers could continue reading even when the libraries were closed owing to the lockdown.Rahul MB, a reader, lauded the government’s initiative. “During the lockdown when libraries and book shops were closed, the app helped students such as myself read many books, while preparing for competitive examinations. I was able to access books on science, commerce, management, et al,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/dharwad-district-boasts-1-5l-readers-on-e-library-app/articleshow/89212838.cms||---

The people in the relatively new district believed that Bommai, in whom the residents have reposed immense faith having elected him to the assembly from the Shiggaon-Savanur constituency thrice, would accelerate the pace of development in Haveri. Among the longstanding demands of the residents of Haveri is that the government establish a state-run medical college. However, even after six months since Bommai was sworn in as the CM, no steps have been taken to bring this dream closer to reality.Although classes were slated to commence at the Haveri Institute of Medical Sciences (HIMS) from the 2021-22 academic year, the National Medical Council (NMC) did not give its nod. However, the Chikkaballapur Institute of Medical Sciences (CIMS) in medical education minister K Sudhakar’s home district, got the nod to start classes from the 2021-22 academic year. Stakeholders in Haveri district attributed the failure on the part of the authorities concerned to commence classes at HIMS to lack of political will.Sources said that the Karnataka government had appealed to the NMC to give its nod to start classes at medical colleges in Yadgir, Chikkaballapur, Chikkamagalur and Haveri. However, NMC refused approval to all institutions barring the one in Chikkaballapur, citing lack of infrastructure, besides lack of staff.The four medical colleges were inspected by members of the NMC in August, and a meeting was convened with the heads of the medical colleges to review the condition of the four colleges.A BJP leader in Haveri lamented the delay in HIMS being given the nod to start classes, despite the CM having been elected to the assembly from the district. “The CM must try to ensure that HIMS is given permission to start classes in 2022-23 academic year,” he said.Special officer for HIMS Dr Uday Mulagund said, “According to the academic calendar for medical courses, counselling for MBBS seats commenced on Friday (January 27). The exercise will end on March 31. Since we have two months, we hope we get NMC’s approval to start classes, and offer HIMS as an option for the students in the second and third rounds of counselling.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/classes-yet-to-start-at-medical-college-in-cms-home-district/articleshow/89212840.cms||Basavaraj Maralihalli

---||Chandigarh||Covid-19: Vaccination condition for offline class needles parents||Poviet KaurCHANDIGARH: Schools are opening for students of classes X to XII from February 1 but according to orders issued by the administration, only vaccinated students in the 15 to 18 age group will be allowed to come to school. The education department said that the option of online education will be kept for students of this age group who have not been vaccinated. Although the education department has not issued a detailed order regarding this, parents are worried. They asked that with the Central government making it clear to the Supreme Court that vaccination will not be imposed without consent, why couldn’t unvaccinated children be sent to school? As per data received by the education department from city schools (both government and private), vaccination in private schools is less as compared to government schools. According to the education department, till this week, 80% of students in the 15-to-18 year age group received their first dose of vaccination. Complete data on vaccination, including which students failed to get vaccinated and why, will be sought from schools next week. Covid vaccination camps were organised in government and private schools in collaboration with the health department so that students could be vaccinated before schools reopened. According to department officials some children missed vaccination as they had gone to their native villages for winter vacations while some did not turn up for vaccination because of the Covid surge. Others did not get themselves vaccinated due to apprehensions and fears. Nancy Singh, mother of a Class 11 student, said, “While I do not say that the vaccines have not been tried and tested, the effect they will have will be known after some time. My husband and I got the vaccine. But although we received calls from the school for our child’s vaccination, I need some time.” Nitin Goyal, president, Chandigarh Parents Association, also said that parents did not trust the vaccines enough. “Every day, we read news of effects of vaccination and now even the Central government has made it clear that vaccination is voluntary. Therefore, the administration should not pressurise schools to get children vaccinated forcibly,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/vaccination-condition-for-offline-class-needles-parents/articleshow/89212846.cms||---

The election has been challenged before the deputy commissioner on the grounds that Gupta concealed information while filing papers to contest the councillor election. The Congress claimed that Gupta, a practicing lawyer, claimed to be a businessman while filing his nomination papers.Rajiv Kumar Moudgil, district president, Chandigarh Congress, filed a petition before the DC, prescribed authority of Chandigarh, to declare the election from ward no. 11 as null and void in view of a false affidavit filed by Anup Gupta, BJP councillor and deputy mayor of the city, before the returning officer in December 2021. Addressing media persons at Congress Bhawan on Saturday, Subhash Chawla, president, Chandigarh Congress said that election from ward number 11 be countermanded and Anup Gupta be prosecuted for filing a false affidavit and giving wrong information before the state election commission.“Anup Gupta has enrolled himself as an advocate in the year of 2007 under Punjab and Haryana Bar Council. He filed an affidavit before the council under rule 47 of Bar Council Rules to the effect that after being enrolled as an advocate, he would not personally engage in any business activity. On December 3, 2021, he swore an affidavit before the returning officer saying on oath that he is a businessman by occupation and declared his income from business,” he said. Chawla said that it is clear from the two affidavits that the senior deputy mayor has falsely deposed before election authorities and strict action should be taken by the authorities concerned. Chawla also stated that filing a false affidavit is an offense under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and demanded that Gupta be booked for doing so.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/congress-challenges-bjp-ward-11-councillors-election/articleshow/89212847.cms||---

He also stressed the need for fast disposal of applications for consent to establish and operate for proper growth of industries. He said the move of auto renewal would bring about greater transparency and faster service delivery for citizens.Dalai said that earlier, the process was supposed to be dealt with in a maximum of 45 days but now, the consent and authorisation certificate was a click away. Elaborating on how simple the new system would be, he said, “Although the online system for grant of consent/authorisation has been there since 2015, it involves prior physical verification of units. However, that has also been curtailed now, he said. The e-consent was introduced by CPCC in the last quarter of 2021 to create a working atmosphere for industries. The auto renewal facility shall ease the procedure for industries, hotels, restaurants and hospitals etc. CPCC has been working on this for the past many days, Dalai added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/cpcc-starts-auto-renewal-of-consent-authorisation-papers/articleshow/89212849.cms||---

---||World||Snow 'bomb' unleashes blizzard on eastern US||NEW YORK: Blinding snow whipped up by powerful winds pummeled the eastern United States on Saturday, as one of the strongest winter storms in years triggered severe weather alerts, transport chaos and power outages across a region of some 70 million people. With multiple blizzard warnings in effect, cities like New York and Boston bore the brunt of the storm, which the National Weather Service (NWS) confirmed Saturday had intensified into a "bomb cyclone" -- characterized by the explosive power of rapid drops in atmospheric pressure. Coastal areas were expected to receive more than one foot (30 centimeters) of snow by the end of the day, and as much as three feet in parts of Massachusetts, where more than 119,000 homes were reported without power. Cold weather alerts were raised as far south as Florida, where the NWS warned of "scattered to isolated falling iguanas from trees" as plunging temperatures temporarily paralyzed the large lizards, which can weigh up to 20 pounds (nine kilograms). Residents in towns and cities across the eastern seaboard were urged to avoid all unnecessary travel in the whiteout conditions. In Long Island, officials said a woman had been found dead in her car by a snowplow operator. Ten inches (25 centimeters) of snow had already accumulated on the island north of Manhattan, and regional train lines were partially shut down. Salt machines and snowplows crawled along the streets of New York City, where city residents awoke Saturday to more than four inches of snow. Mayor Eric Adams posted videos of himself visiting different boroughs throughout the day, urging his fellow New Yorkers to stay at home. In an interview with local radio station WINS, he insisted the city was handling the storm "like a well-oiled machine," adding, "No street has not been touched." In Times Square, the famous neon billboards formed glowing halos in the snowy air. But the frigid temperatures didn't stop Robert Burck, a Times Square fixture known as the "Naked Cowboy." Wearing only his underwear, a cowboy hat and cowboy boots, he strolled through the nearly empty tourist hotspot, strumming his guitar. "It's fantastic," one undaunted tourist, Gonzalo Vazquez of Spain, told AFP in Times Square. "It's like skiing, surrounded by lights and awesome LED screens." In the trendy Cobble Hill neighborhood in Brooklyn, the sidewalks were almost deserted and many businesses were closed. But the few who did brave the elements smiled as they wished each other, "Happy snow day!" A state of emergency has been declared for New York and the neighboring state of New Jersey. New York Governor Kathy Hochul asked state residents to stay home if possible. "The most dangerous phase of the storm is now," she said in a midday statement, "so please continue to avoid any unnecessary travel." For people who had to travel, she urged them to fill their car gas tanks and keep supplies such as ice scrapers, blankets and water in their vehicles. In Boston, Mayor Michelle Wu declared a snow emergency. "It is going to get quite ugly out there," she said in an early morning television interview from City Hall. "This is going to be a historic storm." Massachusetts residents had rushed Friday to buy groceries, as well as snow- and ice-melting pellets to help keep their sidewalks and driveways clear. By early Saturday morning, Boston Public Works said 500 snow plows were already hard at work on the city streets. Plow driver Mark Burns, working in Boston's South Shore area, said he was seeing up to three inches fall in an hour. "It's getting heavy," he said. "It was supposed to be light and fluffy, but it's a little wet now." The NWS said wind gusts would reach up to 60 miles (96 kilometers) per hour. It forecast extremely cold temperatures with dangerous wind chills Saturday night into Sunday morning. The snowfall rate would range from two to four inches per hour, it said, and strong winds would cause "scattered power outages." "Expect whiteout conditions and nearly impossible travel at times," the service said. More than 3,500 flights were canceled for Saturday traveling within, into or out of the United States, according to flight tracker FlightAware, and just over 1,000 flights have already been canceled for Sunday. Cancellations on Friday totaled more than 1,450. The blizzard comes on the heels of a similar winter storm that blanketed a swath of Eastern North America -- from Georgia to Canada -- just two weeks ago, cutting power to thousands of homes and also disrupting thousands of flights.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/snow-bomb-unleashes-blizzard-on-eastern-us/articleshow/89212857.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Bhandara tiger killer nabbed in 24 hrs, 3 still absconding||Nagpur: A day after tiger B2 aka Rudra was electrocuted near Koka wildlife sanctuary in Bhandara, forest officials cracked the case by arresting the kingpin. Three other accused are still absconding. On Friday, an adult tiger was found dead on Paldi-Mathadi road, 5km from Koka sanctuary, which shocked forest officials. An award of Rs25,000 was also announced by the forest department. Acting on a tipoff by volunteers of Paryavaran Sanrakshan Bahuudeshiya Sanstha, Bhandara, working for wildlife conservation, forest officials on Saturday zeroed in on the gang of poachers and nabbed kingpin Dilip Narayan Narnawre (54) of Chandori Malipar village, 5km from the spot where the tiger was electrocuted. The forest team seized 22 wooden sticks, 20 insulators, wire bundles, and other tools from the farms of Ashok Bhongade of Ambadi village. The accused confessed he laid the wire traps along with three others on the night of January 27. After finding that a tiger had died in the trap, all returned at 4am. According to sources, Narnawre belongs to a gang of 12-15 persons who are habitual poachers. The gang targets herbivores by laying live electric wire fences through 11kv power lines and also used stolen MSEDCL insulators to ensure that the line did not trip. The area of operation of the accused used to be away from their native village so that they are not caught easily. In 2018, they had also killed a leopard. The gang members are involved in selling bush meat to highway dhaba wallahs and other influential customers not only in the district but also in MP. Narnawre showed forest officials the spot and the modus operandi to kill animals. CCF P Kalyan Kumar, who visited the spot on Saturday, has directed the staff to pick up those people who used to buy bush meat from these accused. “The report that the 11kv feeder did not trip, if true, is worrisome. The MSEDCL should get the breaker tested. The forest department should find out if this particular gang has found a way to avoid tripping while killing animals. That means the only technological help to detect electrocution is of no use any more and local poachers have gone to the next level,” said Nitin Desai, Central India director of Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/bhandara-tiger-killer-nabbed-in-24-hrs-3-still-absconding/articleshow/89210698.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

The proposed amount will be discussed among members of the general house and passed in the special budget meeting scheduled at the assembly hall of the MC office on Tuesday. Although the figure may change slightly, it will go to the Chandigarh administration to release the grant-in-aid. Out of the total amount, the civic body has kept Rs 401.42 crore under capital segment and the remaining, Rs 1323.77 crore, under revenue category. Interestingly, the MC has projected to earn Rs 616.11 crore from its own resources. This means the MC is expecting an improbable Rs 1,109 crore grant-in-aid from the administration. The budget has been prepared according to recommendations of the 4th Delhi Finance Commission, which has never been implemented in the city. Last year, the MC had prepared Rs 1,646 crore budget comprising Rs 448.45 crore under capital and Rs 1198.40 crore under revenue section. The MC had demanded Rs 1,202 crore as grant-in-aid, assuring to earn Rs 444.61 crore from its own resources, However, it had ended up receiving Rs 502 crore as grant-in-aid from the UT. The capital section comprises money for projects of the city, maintenance and developmental works and new constructions, while revenue section is meant for committed liabilities and expenditure like salaries and wages of all employees of the MC, pension benefits, fuel and other necessary spending. Meanwhile, of the Rs 5,833 budget demanded, by the UT administration, it has sought around Rs 550 crore for the Capital section and around Rs 5,283 crore under the revenue segment. “No matter how much budget is allocated to us, our focus will be on the health segment due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic,” an official had said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/1725-crore-budget-zero-chance-for-mc/articleshow/89212860.cms||Deepak Yadav

Madurai corporation commissioner has also given continued support,” said V Poongavanam, headmistress, Avvai Corporation GHSS.Among the students from the school to get seats, B Sangeetha has got MBBS seat in a self-financed medical college. She comes from a poor family and they are worried if they will be able to afford other expenses needed in pursuing MBBS. “Her father is a ticket agent for a bus service and is the only breadwinner for the family. If she is able to get a sponsor, it will greatly help her pursue her dream without fear,” said the headmistress.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/14-madurai-students-bag-mbbs-seats-in-7-5-quota/articleshow/89212873.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

TANFUFA submitted observations regarding the shortlisted candidates, questioning the basis of selection of at least five of the candidates.“Two VCs (one former and one present) have also been shortlisted, affecting the chances of other eligible and experienced candidates. Four candidates are from Anna University, and this shows bias in favour of an engineering university. All the ten candidates are taken from science stream. The candidates from arts, humanities and social sciences are left out from being represented,” said the association members. They have urged to include three or four candidates from arts/humanities/social sciences so that at least 10% of the applied candidates may be considered for the interaction.TANFUFA also pointed out that the research/publication parameters between universities and colleges and between science subject and social sciences are different and it was not taken into consideration by the committee. The association also sought to ensure transparency by publishing the list of shortlisted candidates on the university website and to suggest three names to the Chancellor only on merit basis without any considerations/pressure.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/transparency-sought-in-selection-of-mku-vc/articleshow/89212874.cms||---

CCTV footage showed that the couple carried the body on a bicycle before disposing it on the bank of Vaigai River. On Friday, the police were alerted of a burnt corpse found under the wall on Vaigai Thenkarai road. On investigation by the Karimedu police, the deceased was identified to be M Manimaran, 43, from Arapalayam. Police said that CCTV footage from the area showed an elderly couple carrying a gunny bag on a bicycle. When the couple was questioned, it was revealed that they were Manimaran’s parents - D Murugesan, 72, and his wife, M Krishnaveni, 55, and they confessed to the murder. Police said that Manimaran was a drunkard and used to regularly abuse his parents, especially his mother, and often engage in drunken quarrels. On Thursday night, he had got into an argument with his parents and the parents had started to beat him up with a stick or rod. Manimaran suddenly fell unconscious and the couple assumed him to be dead. Police said it was unclear whether he died then or died when his body was burnt. The couple made a plan to carry the body in a gunny bag on their bicycle and burn it on the river bank. As Manimaran had been divorced and stayed separated from his wife and family, his parents had thought that no one would come looking for him. The Karimedu police registered a case under IPC sections 302 and 201 for murder and causing disappearance of evidence and arrested the couple.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/couple-arrested-for-killing-drunkard-son-burning-body/articleshow/89212875.cms||---
---||Madurai||Facing flak, SBI freezes controversial hiring circular||Madurai: Following a backlash from job aspirants and others to its recent circular on recruitment of pregnant women and new mothers, SBI on Saturday said it has decided to keep the revised instructions regarding recruitment of pregnant woman candidates in abeyance and continue with the existing system.A bank statement said they had recently reviewed various fitness standards for recruitment, including norms for pregnant women candidates. “The revised guidelines were intended to provide clarity on various health parameters where instructions were not clear or were very old,” it said. However, Madurai MP Su Venkatesan wrote to the SBI chairman earlier in the day alleging gender discrimination by SBI. The MP said that the circular issued by the deputy managing director (HR) of the bank on December 31 prohibits women in the selection list with more than three months pregnancy from joining the bank. They will be considered “temporarily unfit” and “they may be allowed to join within four months after delivery of the child”, it said. This went against the Constitutional principles guaranteeing equality under Articles 14, 15 and 16, Venkatesan added. The bank’s instruction had drawn widespread opposition from various sections, women organisations as well as bank unions across the country. Saturday’s bank statement said that “in some sections of the media, the revision in norms in this regard was interpreted as discriminatory against women.” “SBI has always been proactive towards care and empowerment of its women employees who now constitute around 25% of our workforce. During the pre-Covid period, as per govt instructions, pregnant women employees were exempted from attending office and allowed to work from home,” it added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/facing-flak-sbi-freezes-controversial-hiring-circular/articleshow/89212879.cms||---

The former Union defence minister’s son was referring to Monserrate, who, during the 2019 byelection necessitated by Manohar Parrikar’s death, promised that within 100 days, he would shift casinos out of the Mandovi. Monserrate later backtracked and claimed business would be affected if the casinos were shifted. After filing his nomination on Thursday, Utpal launched his door-to-door campaign from Mala on Saturday, after seeking blessings at Maruti temple. “I will give promises which I will be able to deliver, and I will tell the people of Panaji about my vision and they will vote for me,” Utpal said, adding that his manifesto would be released soon. He said he would try to meet each and every person in Panaji during the campaign. He said circumstances forced him to take the decision to contest the election. Manohar Parrikar represented Panaji for over two decades since 1994. After he was elevated to the position of Union defence minister in 2014, BJP had fielded Parrikar’s close aide Sidharth Kuncalienkar, who won the seat for BJP. Kuncalienker had also won the assembly election in 2017, defeating Monserrate, who was the United Goans Party candidate for Panaji. When Parrikar returned to the state as chief minister, Kuncalienkar vacated the seat for Parrikar to contest and BJP once again won the Panaji seat. After the demise of Parrikar, Kuncalienkar and Utpal both staked claim to BJP’s candidature during the 2019 bypoll in Panaji. But BJP had denied candidature to Utpal at the time. Monserrate, who was the Congress candidate then, made a dent in BJP’s bastion to grab the seat for Congress for the first time since 1994.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/goa/news/utpal-takes-dig-at-babush-says-wont-give-100-days-promises/articleshow/89214567.cms||---

The girl’s family was unhappy as their daughter had married the man against their will and decided to take "revenge" on the woman as she was returning home from the market on Friday evening. They grabbed her, thrashed her with batons and rained blows on her with a sickle. The woman was rushed to hospital by her husband and locals where she succumbed. Her son is yet to return home. An FIR has been registered against six of the girl's relatives under IPC sections related to rioting and culpable homicide. Victim Chameli Kashyap was a resident of Barua village under Faridpur police station. She and her husband had earlier left the village due to fear of reprisal after their son eloped with the girl. She had returned to look after the house on Friday and had to pay a heavy price for her son’s step. Additional SP (rural) Rajkumar Agarwal told TOI, “The victim’s son had eloped with the daughter of the accused who belongs to the same community. They both were adults and got married. After their marriage, the boy’s parents left the village and settled elsewhere. They had come to their house for a few days when the murder happened. Her husband informed the police and took her to the community health centre in Faridpur, where she died during treatment. We have registered an FIR under IPC sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting with deadly weapons) and 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) against six people, based on the her husband's complaint.” The police officer added: "Four of the accused have been arrested and the remaining two will be in our custody soon. We have ensured adequate security for the family and police force has been deployed in the village to ensure peace.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/woman-38-hacked-to-death-after-son-elopes-with-girl/articleshow/89212880.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

As per the agreement, the BJP will contest 12 seats, JD(U) 11 seats and the remaining one seat has gone to the kitty of Union minister Pashupati Kumar Paras-led Rashtriya Lok Janshakti Party (RLJP).Meanwhile, RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav said in New Delhi on Saturday that his party would contest all the 24 council seats in Bihar with the “consent” of Left parties. It means the RJD is in no mood to give any council seat to Congress, its alliance partner in the state.In the NDA camp, no seat was spared for other two NDA allies – former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi-led Hindustani Awam Morcha-Secular (HAM-S) and Mukesh Sahani-led the Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP).

They committed the crime by detonating bombs and firing indiscriminately in a crowded market, then fleeing the scene. According to police sources, six robbers arrived on two motorcycles near the jewellery shop. While three entered the shop, the rest waited outside. The hoodlums threatened the shopowner, Sushil Kumar Sah, with a gun and fled with gold ornaments worth Rs 5 lakh after 20 minutes. A few customers were also present in the shop at the time of the incident. Cops from the Maharajganj police station and DSP Polast Kumar arrived on the scene and immediately began investigating the case. Sushil told them that the miscreants had threatened to murder him if he protested the shop robbery. The DSP stated that a police team was examining several closed-circuit television cameras installed in the market. 1 lakh snatched from man: Two unidentified miscreants on a motorcycle allegedly robbed a 60-year-old man of Rs 1.01 lakh in Rahmatganj locality under the Masaurhi police station area of Patna district on Saturday morning.

---||Patna||Bihar: Teachers have only been asked to keep a tab on liquor consumption, says education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary||PATNA: While representatives of various teachers’ associations and leaders of opposition parties have sharply criticised the recent circular directing schoolteachers to assist in combating liquor law violations, education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary has defended it. Responding to teachers’ union protests over the circular, the minister told this reporter, “It is the responsibility of all enlightened and responsible citizens, including schoolteachers, to immediately notify the government of liquor law violations anywhere in the state. Moreover, teachers have not been assigned a target for sharing information about the violations. They have only been asked to keep an eye on consumption of liquor in the state.” Choudhary added that the circular would hardly jeopardise teachers’ primary responsibilities, as “they are not required to perform any work within a specified time frame”. He pleaded with them not to fall prey to vested interests, including the liquor mafia, and drag the issue out unnecessarily. Earlier, the education department stated in a circular issued on Friday that teachers would be educated about ‘nasha mukti’ and encouraged to share information about violations of the nearly 6-year-old liquor law. However, it drew criticism from the heads of all teachers’ associations, who labelled it “anti-teacher and anti-education”. Pradip Kumar Pappu, the president of the Bihar State Primary Teachers’ Association, took strong exception to the circular and demanded its immediate withdrawal, threatening a state-wide agitation. “The government should have prioritised completing the courses of study of students who are suffering as a result of school closures in response to the repeated surge in Covid-19 cases. However, it chose to involve teachers in disseminating information about those who violate the prohibition law and engage in illicit liquor trade. This is extremely unfortunate,” he stated. Amit Vikram, the state president of the TET Teachers’ Association, pointed out that despite the Patna high court’s orders prohibiting teachers from engaging in non-academic activities, they are always taken for granted by the education department and assigned all manner of odd duties, ranging from selling sacks to checking people involved in the consumption and sale of liquor. He stated that teachers would oppose the order because they “do not wish to jeopardise their own and family members’ lives by becoming informers against the liquor mafia”. Kedar Nath Pandey, the president of the Bihar Secondary Teachers’ Association, expressed his deep anguish over the circular, stating that when the state’s entire police machinery failed to ensure complete prohibition, poor teachers were entrusted with this task. “Now that the teachers have become informants, they will become easy targets for the powerful liquor mafia, endangering their lives. I intend to bring this issue, which affects nearly four lakh teachers in 75,000 government schools, to the state legislative council’s next session,” said Pandey, who is also an MLC. Ram Bali Singh, an RJD MLC, also criticised the government circular and demanded that it be withdrawn immediately. He said, “The state’s primary and secondary education standards are already the lowest in the country and will deteriorate further if teachers continue to work in non-academic jobs.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/teachers-have-only-been-asked-to-keep-a-tab-on-liquor-consumption/articleshow/89212885.cms||---

They all should conduct the inspection works in the proper way to ensure quality of works in roads and government buildings.” Nitish said better maintenance of roads by the department improves the prestige of engineers in the society. “If you execute the road maintenance works in a proper way and visit the construction sites on a regular basis, people living in those areas will give you more respect and honour,” the CM told the engineers.The CM also said that any kind of negligence in the maintenance works would not be tolerated and tough action would be taken against the lax officials.Earlier, additional chief secretary (road construction) Pratyaya Amrit, RWD secretary Pankaj Kumar Pal and BCD secretary Kumar Ravi made a presentation before the CM on their respective maintenance policy.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/cm-prepare-states-bridge-maintenance-policy-soon/articleshow/89212886.cms||Madan Kumar
---||Patna||Bihar: Education department releases funds to universities||PATNA: The state education department released funds to universities to pay teachers and non-teaching staff salary, pension, and other arrears, but only after a post by noted folk singer and Padma Bhushan awardee, Sharda Sinha, about the demise of a retired Lalit Narayan Mithila University (LNMU) teacher went viral on social media. Sinha, a retired teacher from LNMU, had recounted the heartbreaking story of her friend, Isha Sinha, who died because of a lack of medical care and funds. She, along with hundreds of other teachers at LNMU and other universities, have been without salaries and pensions for the last four months.   The education department announced on Friday evening that it had released Rs 401 crore to universities for salary and pension payments to teachers and other employees. The allocation of funds to universities is as follows: Rs 15.64 crore to Patna University, Rs 36.98 crore to Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar Bihar University, Rs 17.64 crore to Veer Kunwar Singh University, Rs 45.06 crore to Jai Prakash University, Rs 8.21 crore to Bhupendra Narayan Mandal University, Rs 20.29 crore to Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur University, Rs 157.35 crore to LNMU, Rs 24.28 crore to Kameshwar Singh Darbhanga Sanskrit University, Rs 33.64 crore to Patliputra University, Rs 4.29 crore to Purnea University, Rs 5.36 crore to Munger University, Rs 32.43 crore to Magadh University, and Rs 18.30 lakh to Maulana Mazharul Haque Arabic and Persian University. Kanhaiya Bahadur Sinha, the state working president of the Federation of University Teachers’ Associations of Bihar, expressed grave concern over the reported irregular payment of salary and pension to teachers. He said, “The education department has a history of making irregular salary and pension payments to teachers and other staff at colleges and universities. It has released grants to universities only twice this fiscal year, causing significant hardship for everyone.” Sinha added that the ad hocism prevalent in universities only added to the teachers’ anguish. He continued, “Even when universities receive government funding, salaries are not paid in the absence of a registrar, finance officer, or financial adviser. The situation is unlikely to improve until both the chancellor and the state government take necessary steps to ensure the universities’ smooth operation.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/edu-dept-releases-funds-to-varsities/articleshow/89212888.cms||B K Mishra
---||Patna||Univs may get revised promotion statutes||Patna: The universities in Bihar are likely to get revised statutes relating to the career advancement scheme (CAS) meant for promotion of college and university teachers soon.The draft statutes have reportedly been sent to the Raj Bhavan for the chancellor’s approval.Raj Bhavan sources said the education department has sent the draft statutes for chancellor’s assent after getting the same approved from the Bihar State Higher Education Council (BSHEC). A legal opinion on the date of implementation and inclusion of college teachers in the revised statutes was also sought from the advocate general. Sources said as early as in July 2018, the chancellor had constituted a three-member committee to draft new statutes for promotions under CAS. The new statutes were drafted by the committee in 2019, taking into consideration all the provisions prescribed in UGC regulations on minimum qualifications for appointment of teachers and other academic staff in universities and colleges and measures for the maintenance of standards in higher education 2018, including academic assessment of teachers before their promotion.However, the file remained stuck up at the state education department for some time owing to the Covid pandemic. In 2021, it was returned to the chancellor’s secretariat with certain queries. But, as two members of the committee — the vice-chancellors of Patna and Munger universities — had relinquished their offices, the chancellor had to constitute a fresh committee to amend the statutes in the light of the new queries.The new committee comprising the vice-chancellors of Magadh, Patna and Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur universities, revised the statutes accordingly. But, it was again stuck up due to lack of unanimity over the date of implementation of the statutes. While some officials wanted the statutes to be implemented from the retrospective date (the date of UGC notification), others were in favour of their implementation from the prospective date.BSHEC vice-chairman Kameshwar Jha told this newspaper that the issue has now been resolved and that the revised statutes would be implemented from the date they are assented to by the chancellor.It may be mentioned here that due to delay in the implementation of the new CAS statutes, promotion of teachers under CAS in Bihar are still being made as per the provisions of the more than two decades old statutes, raising a question mark on the validity of such promotions.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/univs-may-get-revised-promotion-statutes/articleshow/89212889.cms||---

The protesters, including men, women and children carrying CPI(ML) banners raised slogans against the district administration that asked owners of 1,200 houses to prove the validity of the land under their possession by February 2 this year. A rumour is doing rounds that the houses built on government land would be demolished after February 2. One Mahendra Sharma, a resident of Mansur Nagar locality, said they had been living there for generations and most don’t have any papers. He urged the administration to take action only against the liquor smugglers and demolish their houses instead of making innocent people homeless. He said if their houses were sealed or demolished, they would launch intensive protest. Biharsharif SDM Kumar Anurag said the notices were served just to know how many houses were illegally built in those areas. He said only the houses of liquor smugglers would be demolished.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/locals-protest-eviction-move-in-biharsharif/articleshow/89212893.cms||---

JD(U)’s former national president and Union minister RCP Singh as well as some senior ministers from Bihar would also campaign in the later phases of Uttar Pradesh polls, party’s national general secretary Afaque Ahmad Khan told TOI over phone on Saturday. “There should be no confusion regarding the list of the JD(U)’s star campaigners for the Uttar Pradesh assembly polls. Since the majority of JD(U) candidates would be contesting in the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh (last) phases of the election, list of star campaigners will be announced accordingly. While Nitish will campaign virtually, the party’s national president Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan Singh, RCP Singh and other ministers (from Bihar) will also campaign in Uttar Pradesh polls with an aim to strengthen the JD(U)’s Uttar Pradesh state unit,” Khan said in a statement. Earlier in the day, RCP raised questions over the popularity of the leaders included in the party’s star campaigners’ list for UP polls. “Of the 15 persons included in the list, how many people are recognized personalities? Are all these people capable?” RCP asked while talking to mediapersons. Earlier on Friday, the JD(U) had released a list of its 15 star campaigners for the UP polls, but the names of Nitish, RCP were not included. Moreover, the party did not include the names of any of its Bihar’s cabinet ministers in the first list of its star campaigners for the BJP-ruled neighbouring state.

According to health experts, though the new strain of Covid-19 has milder effects, some patients are complaining of long-lasting effect even weeks after testing negative. In most cases, people suffering from Covid are recover in 5-7 days, but complain of persisting complications. Dr Sanjeev Kumar, nodal officer for Covid-19 at All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna (AIIMS-Patna), said many patients are seeking medical advice for different ailments, mainly lingering cough. “In addition to fatigue and weakness, some patients experience cough even after recovery. However, it is still not clear whether the persistent cough is due to cold weather or post-Covid complication,” he added. “In case of prolonged cough, patients should take medical advice from doctors. Some patients also require psychological support. Those with comorbidities are complaining of deterioration in their health condition post Covid recovery. Though the cases of post-Covid complications are less when compared to the second wave, some patients still visit the hospital,” Dr Sanjeev said. Dr Mukul Kumar Singh, epidemiologist at Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH)-Patna, said patients are complaining of long-lasting symptoms, such as body fatigue and dry cough. “The cough persists in several patients for 15-20 days. As Covid affects lungs, some patients are experiencing lingering cough. As far as weakness is concerned, we advise patients to follow proper diet and take rest,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/post-covid-complicationscommon-no-need-to-panic/articleshow/89212900.cms||Faryal Rumi

It has climbed 12 spots to claim the 53rd spot in a recent ranking published by the Union Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs. Previously, the state capital was ranked 65th. Due to the city’s success in completing projects, it earned the state’s second ranking. The Patna Smart City Limited (PSCL) received an overall score of 14.87 out of 100. The state capital got 10 points for project work ordered, 5.19 for fund utilisation, 3.8 for fund transfer, and 4.22 for work completed. According to PSCL officials, the city’s overall ranking, which was between 60 and 70 during the pandemic, has improved as a result of several projects completed and launched last month. The state government has inaugurated several Smart City projects, including the rejuvenation of Adalatganj Pond, the construction of an integrated command and control centre on the premises of the SSP office, the establishment of a Jan Sewa Kendra (common service centre), and vending zones. Besides, the foundation stone was laid for projects such as the redevelopment of the Mandiri drain, the construction of a link road connecting Beerchand Patel Path and Bailey Road, the facelifting of S K Memorial Hall, and the construction of a subway as part of the redevelopment of the station area. As many as 10 different projects have been completed so far under the Smart City Mission, including a mega screen at Gandhi Maidan, remodelling of Beerchand Patel Path, wall art or painting for social awareness, and e-toilets. Two additional projects are scheduled for completion next month, including intermediate public transportation and innovative 3D wall paintings and statues. Harshita, PSCL’s public relations officer (PRO), told TOI that work on redeveloping the Mandiri nullah had begun with the cleaning of the drain. “Once cleaned, the nullah will be covered with drain boxes to allow for the construction of a smart road. It will be 1,289 metres long and will begin at the I-T roundabout and end at Kali Mandir in Bans Ghat. It will connect Bailey Road and Ashok Rajpath directly,” she added. The PRO continued, “Construction of a pedestrian subway connecting the Patna Junction and a multi-level parking structure near Buddha Smriti Park will begin as soon as the design is complete. The technical agency will vet the design before it is approved. According to the detailed project report, 330 metres of the 440-metre-long subway will be underground and 110 metres will be on the surface. The total cost of construction is estimated to be around Rs 68 crore.” The pedestrian subway will be equipped with escalators, travelators, lifts, and a pedestrian walkway. It will be built using cut-and-cover technology. Other features include air conditioning, a ramp, ventilation, a fire extinguisher, a drainage system, and a generator. Meanwhile, Bhagalpur has been ranked 50th, Muzaffarpur 54th, and Biharsharif 59th.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/patna-climbs-12-spots-to-claim-53rd-position-in-smart-city-race/articleshow/89212903.cms||Faryal Rumi

---||Nagpur||NGT takes serious note of bamboo board violations||Nagpur: The National Green Tribunal’s (NGT) western zone bench in Pune has taken note of the series of violations of the forest, environmental and pollution laws by the Maharashtra Bamboo Development Board (MBDB) and other agencies. It has sought replies within six weeks. On October 14, 2020, TOI was the first to report about a major tragedy being averted at Gorewada reserve forest after a blast occurred at one of the illegally set up bamboo treatment units. Aaam Admi Party (AAP) neta Pratap Goswami raised the issue at various forums but no action was taken. Finally, social activist Manoj M Wahane through his lawyer Rahul Choudhary moved the NGT last year. In his application, the petitioner raised violation of provisions of Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 by MBDB. Regional Environment Committee (REC) member Suresh Chopne said, “The MBDB was operating chemical treatment units for bamboo processing in the Gorewada reserve forest without obtaining prior clearance under Section 2 of the FCA 1980. I welcome the NGT decision.” Wahane pointed out that the bamboo board failed to obtain consent to establish from the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) and installed a pollution control system for treatment of effluent generated from activities undertaken in the impugned plant. The MBDB carried out activities in the units without installing the necessary controls in a ‘pressure vessel’ as is mandated by the Maharashtra Factories Rules, 1963. “Such illegally operated pressure vessel used in the plant exploded on October 13, 2020, and explosion led to the discharge of toxic chemical effluents into nearby water streams and river sources, thereby leading to severe degradation of the aquatic ecosystem and water resources,” the petitioner alleged. Owing to the explosion, untreated chemical solution contained in the pressure vessel had leaked out into the Gorewada Lake which is the drinking water source of Nagpur. On November 23, 2020, the MPCB regional officer AM Kare, after approval from the Maharashtra environment ministry, had issued a closure notice to the MBDB. The MBDB was allotted 31.5 hectares of reserve forest land in compartment number 795 on December 12, 2019, without the approval of the state government. All the activities are being carried out in reserve forests without seeking clearance under the FCA, 1980. When the MoU was signed with FDCM for transfer of said land there is no mention about setting up of these units. Hearing the petition, Justice Sheo Kumar Singh, judicial nember, & Dr Vijay Kulkarni, expert member, while passing the orders on January 28 said a substantial question of the environment has been raised. It ordered the issue of notices to the respondents returnable within 4 weeks.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/ngt-takes-serious-note-of-bamboo-board-violations/articleshow/89210720.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

But those people spray perfume. No matter how much perfume you sprinkle on doing wrong things, but the fragrance will not come,” Nadda said while attacking SP chief and former UP chief minister Akhilesh Yadav. “Two ministers of Akhilesh ji are in jail. Some people are contesting from jail and some are on bail,” he said, adding, “SP and BSP have only done caste politics in the state.” Further attacking Akhilesh, the BJP chief said, “He is not only a supporter of terrorists but also does politics of dividing people in the name of religion and caste. Otherwise what was the need to take the name of Jinnah who divided the country?” “We will improve law and order, but they (SP) supported sand mafia, mining mafia, terrorists. BJP is the only political party that runs on the basis of ideas. All other political parties have become parties of familyism, dynasty,” Nadda said. Nadda said that the earlier governments used to forget after laying the foundation stone of schemes. “Plans used to eat dust in files. No work was done,” Nadda said and added, “Today, the picture of UP has changed. Highways, expressways have been built here.” He said, ‘Whatever we lay the foundation stone for, we also fulfill it. BJP is such a party which can say with confidence that it has done what was said.” He asked whether Akhilesh and Mayawati have the courage to organize Jan Vishwas Yatra. “This power is in the BJP, they do what they say. They will do whatever they say. We have united people, they have broken. We gave the coolness of Ayushman to those who did not even support us. He divided people on religion. Akhilesh only proved the selfishness of the family. Made false promises. Their system is that of goondaraj and mafiaraj.”. At the same time, praising the BJP government, he said that under the leadership of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, work has been done on the principle of ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas and Sabka Vishwas’. He further said that those who called themselves farmer leaders did not do any good to the farmers. “Many people tried to project themselves as a farmer leader but no one could do for welfare of farmers what PM Narendra Modi did. India’s agriculture budget has been increased to Rs 1.23 lakh crores per annum from Rs 22,000 crores per annum (2014),” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kanpur/nadda-perfume-fragrance-will-not-hide-wrongdoings/articleshow/89212908.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

On Saturday, at around 1.30 pm, the former Indian Police Service (IPS) officer reached the nomination room at the Collectorate along with two proposers, Sharad Mishra and Ramshankar Lodhi, and filed his nomination. After filing nomination, Arun while interacting with the media said, “I will stand for the ideals for which I came into politics... I believe I will make the path of a clean politics for myself.” He added, “I will also encourage other colleagues to come forward and join politics like me.” He further said that he is contesting election on two issues — law and order and second development. “In the last five years, the BJP has done a great job in terms of development. With that I am going amongst voters and I wish that I have come in politics with honesty and transparency with good methods and expect more friends like me will come in future and I will stick to the ideals I stand for.” Arun said that he is campaigning as per the Election Commission guideline and would like that the election is contested in the spirit of competition and not fighting, all those who win will work together as per the country’s democratic setup. “We are doing door-to-door campaigning and holding small meetings within its (Election Commission) guidelines. Along with this, we are trying to promote our party’s manifesto through social media, which has become a very important tool these days, but as it is limited in the rural areas. Therefore, along with social media, we are trying to create a balance of door-to-door publicity, we are working in both the fields.” Samajwadi Party (SP) has fielded Anil Dohre, who filed his nomination on January 27. BSP has fielded Samarjit Dohre as it’s candidate, but he is yet to file his nomination. Congress has not yet declared its candidate. Kannauj has been a stronghold of the Yadav clan for almost two decades. While Mulayam won the Kannauj Lok Sabha seat in 1999, Akhilesh was elected MP from Kannauj for three consecutive terms — 2000, 2004 and 2009 — till he resigned in 2012 to be sworn in as the chief minister of UP. In the bypoll that followed, Dimple Yadav was elected unopposed as MP and re-elected in the 2014 general elections.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kanpur/ex-ips-officer-asim-arunfiles-papers-from-kannauj/articleshow/89212910.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

Therefore, along with social media, we are trying to create a balance of door-to-door publicity, we are working in both the fields.” Samajwadi Party (SP) has fielded Anil Dohre, who filed his nomination on January 27. BSP has fielded Samarjit Dohre as it’s candidate, but he is yet to file his nomination. Congress has not yet declared its candidate. Kannauj has been a stronghold of the Yadav clan for almost two decades. While Mulayam won the Kannauj Lok Sabha seat in 1999, Akhilesh was elected MP from Kannauj for three consecutive terms — 2000, 2004 and 2009 — till he resigned in 2012 to be sworn in as the chief minister of UP. In the bypoll that followed, Dimple Yadav was elected unopposed as MP and re-elected in the 2014 general elections.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/ex-ips-officer-asim-arunfiles-papers-from-kannauj/articleshow/89215096.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

To manage the huge rush of passengers, UPMRC had to rope in their extra staff. Such was a scene during the initial days of launch of Kanpur Metro. A good number of people travel on Kanpur Metro each day. Such is the scene when the entire corridor of which IIT and Motijheel is a part of - is not complete yet.On completion, Kanpur Metro will run between IIT and Naubasta covering a distance of about 24 kms. The number of metro passengers will increase manifold when the entire corridor becomes operational which may take another two years from now. At present, Kanpur Metro operates from 6am and 10 pm. Three metro trains operate on the elevated IIT-Motijheel corridor. One metro train had arrived in the city two days ago and is now being readied at the metro depot at Gurudev crossing.

---||Ludhiana||Friends turned foes in race for many Ludhiana seats||Ludhiana: This assembly elections, the voters will witness some interesting fights among the friends turned foes. These candidates were once allies or in the same party but now they contest against each other. Like Bikram Singh Majithia from the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and Navjot Singh Sidhu from the Congress are pitted against each other but sometime ago were together in the SAD-BJP alliance, many local candidates also have a similar history. The BJP and the Shiromani Akali Dal have fought many elections in alliance but, this time, both parties are rivals in the poll arena. From the Ludihiana North constituency, the Bharatiya Janata Party has fielded Parveen Bansal for third time in a row despite his losing the seat in the previous two attempts. He will fight against R D Sharma, who has joined the Shiromani Akali Dal after leaving the BJP. From the North constituency, the Aam Aadmi Party has fielded Madan Lal Bagga, who was in the SAD earlier. In 2017, Bagga had contested as independent candidate and created trouble for Parveen Bansal, while now he will pose challenge to both Parveen Bansal and R D Sharma. Asked about the constest, Sharma said: “It doesn’t matter from which side I contest. When I was in the BJP, I worked whole-heartedly there, and now I am in the Akali Dal, so I am performing my duty here. I wish all the best to all the contenders, no matter who belongs to which party. I believe that instead of worrying about my opponents, I should concentrate on my own campaign. As far as Parveen Bansal is concerned, he is a senior politician and I respect him.”Asked about the constest, Bansal said: “The competition should be healthy. Had it not beed RD Sharma, it would have been someone else. I would still have given my best. Rest is up to the voting public.” Similarly from Dakha constituency, Captain Sandeep Sandhu of the Congress and Damanjit Singh Mohi of the Punjab Lok Congress (PLC) are fighting against each other. During Captain Amarinder Singh time as chief minister in 2017, both had served as officer on special duty (OSD) to the CM. Sandhu decided to stay in the Congress, while Mohi went with Captain when he formed his own party.From the Ludhiana West constituency, cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu of the Congress and Gurpreet Gogi of the Aam Aadmi Party are against each other. Gogi had joined AAP after quitting the Congress recently. Even in the Ludhiana central constituency, Congress candidate Surinder Dawar is jup against AAP’s Ashok Prashar Pappi, who was once in the Congress. Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) MLA Simarjit Singh Bains and Congress candidate Kamaljit Singh Karwal are rivals for a second time, whereas they used to be on good terms with each other until a few years ago. There is a similar scenario in several other constituencies. A senior political observer said: “This king of a challenge is in almost every constituency of Ludhiana district, because the number of parties have increased and overambitious politicians who used to contest as independents if denied ticket have got the election ticket and symbol. It is purely a marriage of convenience. The parties needed candidates and the candidates needed parties.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/friends-turned-foes-in-race-for-many-ludhiana-seats/articleshow/89212925.cms||---

The incident occurred on January 27 and was captured on a CCTV camera, but the Division number 6 police have not registered a case in this matter so far. Thereafter, the shop owner made the CCTV footage of the incident viral. He also alleged that the same accused had executed dozens of thefts and snatching in the area, however the police had not taken any action so far. Gurpreet Singh, the Model Town-based owner of Dyal Sweet Shop & Bakery, said he had gone home after closing his shop on January 26 night. Around 5.15 am, he received a call from the watchman that the shutter of the shop was broken. He rushed to the shop and found the cash drawer broken.“I checked the CCTV footage and saw two men on a motorcycle carrying the crime. The accused at first tried to break the shutter, but failed. Thereafter, they pulled the shutter and made a gap. One of the accused entered the shop and using some sharp tool broke open the cash drawer. They took away Rs 35,000 kept in the drawer. While escaping, the accused also took away a power supply device, possibly mistaking it to be DVR of CCTV camera,” Gurpreet added. Gurpreet said he lodged a complaint with the division number 6 police the same day, however the police did not register a case even after two days. Therefore, he had to make the CCTV viral to build pressure on the police. The shop owner said, “The accused captured on the CCTV cameras had earlier executed a dozen of thefts and snatching in the area in the past four months. The incident occured in spite of the fact that a CIA-III office and a permanent police check post are located just a few metres away.”At first, ASI Sukhdev Singh, investigating officer, said the police would lodge an FIR after arresting the accused. Later, the ASI said the complainant had asked to delay the FIR and rather trace the accused first.

---||Delhi||Fresh push to uproot Vilayati kikar||New Delhi: It has been nearly a year since the Delhi cabinet cleared the project to remove invasive species such as Vilayati kikar and lantana from the Central Ridge. But with the expert advisory committee not taking a “uniform decision”, the project couldn’t take off. The forest department has now submitted a fresh proposal to Delhi government seeking reapproval for the removal of the invasive species from 10 hectares of the Ridge as a pilot project. The forest department proposes to remove Vilayati kikar (Prosopis juliflora) through canopy lifting and its replacement with indigenous trees, shrubs and grasses. The root-and-stock removal method has been planned to eradicate lantana (Lantana camara). The removal of kikar was first taken up in 2017, when Delhi government provided Rs 50 lakh for the purpose in its annual budget. In March 2021, Delhi government constituted an expert advisory committee to monitor and ensure timely compliance of “Ecological Restoration of Central Ridge through Biodiversity Enrichment” project. The initial plan was to get rid of the invasive kikar and create natural attractions like forest trails, water bodies, cycleways and a recreational park in the Central Ridge. “Due to a mismatch of opinions of advisory committee members, the project couldn’t begin. But we cannot delay the project any further and so, the forest department has now proposed to remove Vilayati kikar and lantana on its own without the help of the expert committee,” said a forest official. According to the proposal submitted to environment minister Gopal Rai, 10 hectares of the 864 hectares of the Central Ridge will be selected for the pilot. For eradicating Vilayati kikar, the plan is to lift the canopy to allow sunlight to reach the forest floor and native species to be planted around the small invasive tree. Creepers will also be used against the kikar to naturally strangulate it. “However, because lantana regenerates quickly, we plan to employ the root-and-stock method of culling, which has been done in some other states too. The roots of the plant will be cut and disposed in such a manner as to ensure that it does not come in contact with the soil for regeneration,” explained a forest official. Though awaiting official nod, the forest department will start the project in March. “The aim is to ecologically restore the Central Ridge. Indigenous species of trees, shrubs and grasses will be planted to enhance the flora and fauna biodiversity. The plantation will be carried out with habitat management of wildlife in focus,” said a forest official, adding that the pilot will be replicated in other parts of the Central Ridge.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/fresh-push-to-uproot-vilayati-kikar/articleshow/89211924.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

Congress and GFP have written to the Chief Election Commissioner and asked that all the data on Goan voters collected by I-PAC be seized. The two parties, which are fighting the Goa assembly elections in an alliance, said that I-PAC is collecting data using dubious means and by promising benefits under non-existent schemes. Congress general secretary Sunil Kawthankar and GFP general secretary Durgadas Kamat demanded an investigation into the collection of personal information of voters. “TMC claims that around 3 lakh women and more than 2 lakh youth have enrolled for these schemes. As it turns out, their exercise is not just an awareness drive for their 2022 election campaign. It is in fact a massive data collection drive where they will use this data of lakhs of Goans for purposes other than the current election,” Kawthankar said. Kamat said that I-PAC is paying volunteers Rs 800 for every 15 voters enrolled. “It is clear that TMC has come here to split votes and collect data. In Mayem, women have told us that they are being harassed to register. This data will be sold to various agencies for research and marketing,” said Kamat.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/goa/news/cong-gfp-write-to-ec-over-tmc-data-collection/articleshow/89214322.cms||---

The two parties, which are fighting the Goa assembly elections in an alliance, said that I-PAC is collecting data using dubious means and by promising benefits under non-existent schemes. Congress general secretary Sunil Kawthankar and GFP general secretary Durgadas Kamat demanded an investigation into the collection of personal information of voters. “TMC claims that around 3 lakh women and more than 2 lakh youth have enrolled for these schemes. As it turns out, their exercise is not just an awareness drive for their 2022 election campaign. It is in fact a massive data collection drive where they will use this data of lakhs of Goans for purposes other than the current election,” Kawthankar said. Kamat said that I-PAC is paying volunteers Rs 800 for every 15 voters enrolled. “It is clear that TMC has come here to split votes and collect data. In Mayem, women have told us that they are being harassed to register. This data will be sold to various agencies for research and marketing,” said Kamat.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/cong-gfp-write-to-ec-over-tmc-data-collection/articleshow/89210758.cms||---

Thereafter, he called the fire brigade.Walia said the fire reached the second floor of the house and damaged the furniture and other stuff. He incurred a loss of approximately Rs 4 lakh.Another locality resident Sandeep Rai said his autorickshaw and a Tata Nano car of another resident Survinder Singh was also set ablaze by the accused.Rai said, “In the past few months, some vehicles parked outside the house had either been damaged or set ablaze. However, they were not aware that Shankar might be behind such incidents. However this time, the residents woke up and noticed Shankar fleeing the spot.

Businessmen felt that some special reliefs might come their way considering that Punjab too is going for polls.Upkar Singh Ahuja, president of Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertakings (CICU), said, “The Union Budget 2022 is scheduled to be announced on February 1, and due to elections in several states — Goa, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab — it is likely that this is going to be a populist budget. In fact, we are anticipating that the election-bound states like Punjab will definitely get some special incentives and benefits. This is right time for the Centre to strike a chord with the disgruntled businessmen of Punjab by introducing business-friendly measures and helping the ailing industry of the state to recover from the unprecedented losses.”Rajkumar Singla, president of Fastener Supplier Association Ludhiana, said, “Due to elections in four states, there is hardly any chance of government putting any new tax burden on the business community or anyone else. Therefore, unlike in the past budgets when several harsh announcements were made by the Centre, there is very low probability of the same this year.”Atul Saggar, general secretary of Apparel Manufacturers Association Ludhiana, said, “The assembly election in Punjab is kind of a blessing in disguise for us as there is very bright chance that our demands like introduction of special booster package for micro small and medium enterprises (MSME) units of Punjab could be accepted by the Union finance minister.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/ahead-of-polls-city-bizmen-anticipate-populist-budget/articleshow/89212934.cms||Mohit Behl
---||Pune||Maharashtra: IAS officer held from Thane in TET malpractice case||PUNE: An IAS officer was arrested on Saturday morning from his Thane residence for his involvement in the Teachers’ Eligibility Test 2019 malpractice case. A team headed by deputy commissioner of police (cyber) Bhagyashri Navatake, inspector DS Hake, and inspector Kumar Ghadge arrested the officer, Sushil Dadarao Khodwekar (43), from Thane. He was produced before a city court on Saturday afternoon, which remanded him in police custody till January 31. Pune commissioner of police (CP) Amitabh Gupta said, “Before making the arrest, his role in the case was verified.” According to the Pune police, Khodwekar is currently posted with the state agriculture department as a deputy secretary in Mumbai. He served as a deputy secretary with the education department between June 2019 and November 2020 in Mumbai. An IAS officer of 2011 batch, Khodwekar is from Parali in Beed district. Khodwekar also served at Parbhani Zilla Parishad, Nanded Waghala City Municipal Corporation and held few other important government portfolios. The probe into the TET 2019, held in January 2020, so far revealed that the marks of 7,800 candidates, who either failed or did not secure enough scores, were manipulated in exchange of money to declare them eligible for the teachers' job in the state establishments. The police said a few more suspects in the case would be arrested soon. In November and December 2021, the cyber police arrested then Maharashtra State Council of Examinations (MSCE)'s commissioner Tukaram Supe, former MSCE commissioner Sukhdeo Dere (61), GA Software's director Pritish Deshmukh, former manager of GA Software company Ashwin Kumar (49), consultant to the education department Abhishekh Savarikar and others in the case. Dere was arrested after the police learned during Supe's custodial interrogation about the malpractices in the 2018 exam. During Supe's interrogation, it was revealed that Savarikar had made a list of over 300 candidates and passed it on to Khodwekar. The latter then gave it to Supe. "Khodwekar was then conducting an inquiry against Supe, ordered by the government. Taking advantage of it, Khodwekar pressurised Supe to favour the candidates mentioned in the list provided by Savarikar. All this was done against monetary benefits," the police said. A senior police officer said, "The GA Software company was blacklisted by the government after some malpractices surfaced. But Khodwekar favoured the firm and gave it the work of conducting TET. Probe on this revelation is on."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/ias-officer-arrested-in-tet-malpractice-case/articleshow/89212936.cms||---

Like bears and elephants, giraffes are particularly ill-suited to life in captivity. In the wild, giraffes have a life expectancy of about 25 years, but they rarely survive a few years in captivity. Giraffes are used to walking 20km to 50km daily, and restricted space negatively impacts their welfare. The same applies to zebras.”Anjali Kudale, another DGPS member, said, “There are better ways to teach children about wildlife than to show them stressed and miserable animals in confined spaces.” DGPS members said that the PMC should instead divert the funds for creating better infrastructure at the Katraj zoo. Hemant Rasane, PMC standing committee chairman, said, “Proper enclosures will be made for the animals and the proposal will first have to be sanctioned by the central zoo committee. The procedure will be undertaken as per the zoo management guidelines.”Neha Panchamia, founder and President of RESQ Charitable Trust, and RESQ Wildlife Transit Treatment Centre said, “I am all for zoos that are leaders of captive breeding and reintroduction efforts of critically endangered species or ones that house animals, which cannot be released into the wild. The species being brought in — giraffes and zebras — will adapt to our country’s climate, and in fact, if health is maintained well, captive wildlife generally outlive their wild counterparts.”Panchamia added, “However, what many are feeling disgruntled about is the choice of species that are being brought in. If we were bringing in a species that was critically endangered, at least that would hold conservation and breeding value as well as some educational value for children, so they’d be able to learn about why they are being bred or being protected here in a zoo.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/deccan-gymkhana-parisar-opposes-bid-to-import-giraffes-zebras-for-zoo/articleshow/89212937.cms||Neha Madaan

The bullet shells were found to be empty while the khaki uniform belongs to a home guard,” said senior inspector Shankar Awatade of Pimpri police station.“We have initiated an inquiry into the incident and further investigations are on,” Awatade said.“The home guard had reported that the car was stolen about a year ago from the MIDC Bhosari area. He also registered a vehicle theft complaint with the MIDC Bhosari police station. The khaki uniform and the cap, with ‘police’ written on it, belongs to the home guard,” he said.“For the last six to seven months, the car had remained parked on the spot. It is not known why the car was stolen and if it was used to execute any crime,” he said.Awatade said, “Such empty bullet shells are traded for its copper content.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/bullet-shells-khaki-uniform-found-in-discarded-car/articleshow/89212938.cms||---

This should be categorically impressed upon the public,” the deputy chief minister said. He said the state has minimal users of wine and most of it is exported to other states and countries. “The government is concerned about the welfare of people in the state and no harmful decision will be taken by it,” he said, while urging party workers and allies to not get drawn by the Opposition’s criticism. The deputy CM said even Madhya Pradesh, a BJP-ruled state, has decided to allow liquor sale in supermarkets. “But, it is a decision taken by the Madhya Pradesh CM and his cabinet, who are elected by the people. We can also counter BJP by citing this example, but we don’t want to get into it,” Pawar said. He said there was no question of turning the state into a liquor destination as alleged by the Opposition.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/deputy-cm-tears-into-bjps-criticism-over-wine-sale/articleshow/89212940.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Three booked for extorting money from a scrap dealer||PUNE: The Chakan police are searching for three persons for allegedly extorting Rs8.25 lakh from a scrap dealer based in Mhalunge village near Chakan. “One of the suspects is a history-sheeter, while the other two are involved in agriculture-related business in the Chakan and Manchar areas,” police said. According to police, the suspects issued threats of dire consequences to the dealer in November 2018 and took Rs15,000 from him. They didn’t stop at that and started collecting hafta (protection money) of Re 1 per kg of scrap from him from 2018. Inspector Dashrath Waghmode, who is investigating the case, said they were yet to arrest the suspects. “The complainant kept giving hafta to them from 2018. He did not come forward in the past to register a case against them so we could not act against the suspects. Now that he has filed a complaint, we are looking for the suspects and try to nab them soon,” said Waghmode. Police said further investigation into the case was still under way. Senior officers, including Pimpri Chinchwad police commissioner Krishna Prakash, have held numerous meetings with industry representatives in the past to address their security-related concerns.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/three-booked-for-extorting-money-from-a-scrap-dealer/articleshow/89212941.cms||---
---||Pune||Registration of high-end cars vrooms in 2021 in Pune||PUNE: The registration of high-end cars priced at above Rs 40 lakh hit three-year high in the pandemic-riddled 2021 in the Pune RTO, indicating a few always have enough to splurge. Going by the figures provided by the Pune Regional Transport Office (RTO), there was over a 100% increase in the registration of these cars in 2021 compared to 2020. Compared to the pre-pandemic times in 2019, the rise was around 29%. Several sports utility vehicles (SUVs) as well as hatchbacks and sedans of leading carmakers cost over Rs40 lakh in India. “Probably, people not affected financially by the pandemic decided to buy their favourite cars last year. The higher registration of such cars in 2021 than that in 2019 springs a surprise for sure. We cannot give a very specific reason for it because the registration of cars in general in 2021 has been decent compared to 2020 despite the semiconductor chip issue,” an RTO official said. Amar J Sheth, the state president of the Federation of Automobile Dealers’ Association (FADA), told TOI that the pandemic had not been a financially draining scenario for all. “Many industries, including the pharmaceutical companies and consultancy firms, made money. Thus, for some people, economic distress was not a factor at all in the past one-and-a-half years. They might have faced other issues, though. For example, some of them might have had to cancel a planned a holiday abroad. Or a lavish destination wedding had to be cancelled because of the pandemic. Some such people decided to use the money saved to splurge in a high-end car. This is one reason behind the increase in high-end car registrations in 2021 compared to the earlier two years,” he said. Sheth said a few others unaffected financially last year just decided to go for a big buy. “The pandemic has shown everything, including life, is extremely unpredictable. Hence, some people might have just changed their perspective of life. Instead of planning and waiting to do something like buying a high-end car, they just bought it,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/registration-of-high-end-cars-vrooms-in-2021-in-pune/articleshow/89212942.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Pune||Rajesh Tope hints at Covid-19 third wave waning in Maharashtra||PUNE: Hinting at the Covid-19 third wave declining in Maharashtra, health minister Rajesh Tope on Saturday said the daily cases in the state declined to 25,000 from around 47,000 per day recently — almost a 50% dip. Tope, on a visit to the city on Saturday, said, “Almost 90-95% hospital beds are vacant in the state, while the requirement of ventilators and ICU beds is less than 1%. Cases have declined in Mumbai, Thane, Raigad and Palghar, but infections are yet to dip in Pune, Nashik, Nagpur and rural areas. But the hospitalisation rate in these areas is also less. Those affected are getting better in 5-7 days and so, there is no need to worry.” Pune also has a silver lining, as deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said Covid cases had dropped in the district in the last two days. He said the situation should be closely monitored in the coming week to assert with conviction that the cases were going down in the district after the peak. He said despite the increase in cases and the test positivity rate, the hospitalisation rate was low. The oxygen requirement was nearly 75% less than that during the second wave and so was the oxygen demand, Ajit Pawar said, after the district’s Covid review meeting on Saturday. “The daily oxygen requirement during the second wave was nearly 340 metric tonnes and the current requirement in the district is 91 metric tonnes each day. The daily requirement of oxygen in Pune before the pandemic was 85 metric tonnes. So, only 5% more oxygen is needed currently,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/tope-hints-at-covid-19-third-wave-waning-in-maharashtra/articleshow/89212943.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Aurangabad||Covid-19: Patients in hospital care dip 41% in Maharashtra in two weeks||PUNE: The number of Covid patients in hospital care has dropped 41% across Maharashtra to nearly 17,000 in the week ending January 25 as compared to 29,000 around January 10, public health department data has revealed, with several districts, including Mumbai and Thane, past their third wave peak. State disease surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate told TOI, “Currently, nearly 85-90% Covid cases are asymptomatic or mild and in home isolation. This has led to around just 5% occupancy in isolation beds in Maharashtra, 3.46% occupancy of oxygen beds and 7% usage of total among ventilator beds.” Dr Awate said some Konkan districts like Mumbai, Thane, Palghar, Raigad and vicinity were witnessing a decline in new Covid cases after having crossed the peak. State data showed that the number of severe Covid cases has also seen a drop in the latest week, from 6,181 earlier to 5,825 in the week ending January 25. Maharashtra Covid task force member Dr Shashank Joshi told TOI that the only yardstick to measure true subsidence in the current Covid surge is the number of patients in hospitals, Covid mortality rate, those on ventilators and oxygen support. Dr Joshi said, “Currently, hospitalized patients are mainly senior citizens, those who have severe immunocompromised disease and patients who have underlying illnesses or comorbidities. Even these numbers are less now. In geographies like Mumbai and Thane, there has been a definite decline in Covid cases. In other geographical clusters in the state, there may be a plateau and in some others, a rise in Covid cases. Such heterogeneous clusters are spread across the nation.” Intensivist Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of the state Covid task force, told TOI, “There is a significant drop in Covid hospitalizations in the last one week. We still have a few ICU requests coming across but that is expected because severe admissions always lag by a week or two after Covid surge. But these are nowhere close to the numbers a week ago.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/patients-in-hosp-care-dip-41-in-state-in-two-weeks/articleshow/89219847.cms||Neha Madaan

Prashanth Vishwanath, country head India, Veganuary, said, “According to reports, 60% Indians have a more positive perception of plant-based/vegan diets compared to two years ago. The fact that plant-based food is better suited for recovery from various ailments has contributed towards the surge in people making the shift in their diet.” Darshana Muzumdar, campaign manager at Million Dollar Vegan (India), attributed the popularity of veganism in India over the last two years to social media, celebrities, pop culture and the work by associated campaigns launched in the country. Jumping into the vegan bandwagon, a food delivery app announced a partnership with plant-based meat manufacturer to make plant-based products more accessible to customers. Popular demand has encouraged bakeries to provide vegan versions of confectionery items as well. “We are planning to introduce sugar-free and vegan varieties of some of our popular products,” said Yusuf Mirdehghan, owner, Husseny Bakery. Nutritionist Karishma Shah pointed out that 80% of the 40-50 clients she sees in a month, turn out to be lactose intolerant and so have to be put on a vegan diet. “Indians don’t realise that they are lactose intolerant because they take acid reflux, and other digestive issues lightly.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/more-takers-for-veganism-in-india-now-than-pre-coronavirus-period/articleshow/89212945.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar also said the state had no plan to do away with masks, as had been wrongly reported by some channels. “There was no such discussion in the state cabinet,” he said, adding that the channels should not create any confusion by flashing wrong news.
