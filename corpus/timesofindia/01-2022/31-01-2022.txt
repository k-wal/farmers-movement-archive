The cache was later destroyed by the bomb disposal squad. The recovery came hours after an IED was found on the Jammu-Poonch highway and neutralised. During a routine patrol, a joint team of the Army based in Jaranawali Gali and local police found a suspicious-looking bag hidden in some bushes along the roadside. “As per SOP, a bomb disposal squad from the Army and cops from DPL Poonch were called in immediately. The teams rushed to the spot and opened the bag to reveal 250 detonators inside,” said an official source. “The bomb disposal squad destroyed all the detonators on the spot in a controlled explosion,” added the source. The area was cordoned off and a search was launched for more explosives till the time of going to press. Earlier on Saturday, security forces found an IED near Sheendara village on the Jammu-Poonch highway which was later defused by the bomb disposal squad. A preliminary investigation suggested that the explosive was an old one that had gathered rust while remaining buried.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/security-forces-recover-250-detonators-in-poonch/articleshow/89229983.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

Wani's killing along with three associates at Naira in Pulwama, and a Lashkar-e-Taiba recruit in the day's other encounter at Budgam's Charar-e-Shareef, led security forces to declare they were on track to get the number of active terrorists in the Valley down to under 100 this year. The Jaish commander, known to be an expert in making improvised explosive devices, was holed up in a house with a couple of aides when a joint squad of the police, Army and CRPF cordoned off the area. The son of the house owner, later identified as a "hybrid terrorist" affiliated to JeM, joined Wani and his aides in firing at the advancing team. "In the initial assault by our forces, three terrorists were killed. We subsequently confirmed the presence of a fourth terrorist and gunned him down. He turned out to be JeM's south Kashmir chief," Lt Gen Prashant Srivastava, GOC of the Army's Victor Force, said at a joint presser with IGP Vijay Kumar at Balapur in Shopian. Wani had been active in J&K since 2017 and masterminded multiple attacks on security forces and civilians. His brother, also a terrorist, was captured sometime ago and is in jail. "Wani being eliminated is a big success for counter-terrorism forces in Kashmir," Lt Gen Srivastava said. IGP Kumar said the house owner’s slain son, Inayat Ahmed, had been given the opportunity to surrender, but he chose to attack the search team. Inayat's role as a so-called hybrid terrorist, a relatively new challenge for security forces in Kashmir, was to sporadically participate in terror activities. Unlike listed terrorists whose identities are known, hybrid terrorists function as faceless members of the network and are deployed just once or twice, making them hard to track. The police intend to book Inayat's father under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. Since the start of the year, a total of 21 terrorists have been killed in 11 encounters with security forces. "Foreign terrorists who had so far been in hiding in the forests are now entering civilian areas and mingling with the local population. The good part is we have been able to pinpoint them through intelligence and technical inputs. All recent operations in which terrorists were killed have been clean, with no casualties on our side and zero collateral damage," the IGP said. The strategy to bring down the number of active terrorists to below 100 by the end of the year involves not just operations, but also a concerted campaign to reduce local recruitment by terror outfits. Besides planning and executing terror attacks, slain Jaish commander Wani had been a headache for forces because of his sustained recruitment drive in south Kashmir.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/wanted-jem-commander-among-5-terrorists-killed-in-jk/articleshow/89229995.cms||M Saleem Pandit

Every year, the budget allows for concerned parties to get a detailed analysis of the government’s expenditure and investment plan for the fiscal year. It also gives an insight about the economic stance of the government and helps industries and businesses plan their strategy and future course of action. Talking about the tech and start-up space, 2021 has been an unprecedented year. With regards to funding and overseas listings, the sector has seen some major upticks, yet some grey areas continue to dominate this segment. Overseas listingsIndia had, as early as 1993, permitted an overseas listing of Foreign Currency Convertible Bonds (FCCBs) and Ordinary Shares [American Depository Receipts (ADR)/Global Depository Receipts (GDR)] through a depository receipt mechanism in popular stock exchanges such as London, Singapore, and New York (NYSE and NASDAQ). Such DR’s were listed and freely traded in the overseas markets and till 2005 no Indian listing was required. Two-way fungibility of ADRs/ GDRs/ FCCBs was also permitted. However, in 2005 the ADR/GDR/FCCB route was amended to restrict Indian companies from raising capital through a foreign listing without a prior or simultaneous domestic listing. This was based on the need felt by the SEBI to regulate access to overseas listings. Although the Ministry of Finance (in May 2020) announced that Indian companies would be allowed to list their shares directly in foreign stock exchanges, there is still a lack of clarity regarding overseas listing rules. The legislation related to overseas listings is yet to be announced by the Government of India. Expectations from budget 2022 on Direct Overseas Listing:* Expedite the notification for the direct listing framework. * Exempt direct listing overseas from the mischief of round tripping under RBI Rules. In other words, allow residents to participate (buy / sell) overseas listed stocks of Indian companies. * Permit unlisted Indian companies to issue and list ADR/GDR in the IFSC (and perhaps overseas). This can be achieved easily (as it is a revert to the original regulatory position) with safeguards that can be brought about under Companies Act. * Provide a limited period tax incentive of dividend and capital gains exemptions to all primary investments done into and by IFSC SPACs in Indian targets – for about the next two to three years. This will promote usage of IFSC SPACs OR alternatively extend the lower tax rate of long-term capital gains as available to listed equity investments (currently taxed at 11.9%) to long term capital gains from sale of shares of start-ups. Currently the long-term tax rate can be as high as 28.5% for residents. Start-up sectorWith over $38 billion in funding spread across 2,055 rounds, 12 initial public offerings, and the emergence of over 30 unicorns, 2021 proved to be a landmark year for India start-ups. The government of India has always had its ears close to the ground, which is why this sector could not have been left unfettered and unregulated, especially having such huge financial implications. The angel tax was introduced in the FY13 budget to stop money laundering by levying it on start-ups that raised equity funding at a price over and above the fair valuation of the shares. Angel tax is the tax levied under section 56(2)(viib) of the Income Tax Act 1961 (“the Act”), on the capital raised by privately held companies via the issue of shares to a resident, the consideration for which exceeds the face value and the Fair Market Value (FMV) of the shares issued. The name is influenced by those wealthy individuals (“angels”) who invest heavily in risky business and start-up ventures, in the initial stages. In 2019, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced an exemption for DPIIT- registered start-ups from the 30% angel tax levied for receiving investment against the issuance of shares which exceeds the fair market value. Expectations from budget 2022 on Angel Tax and other issues:* Angel tax exemption for shares issued by start up at premium: Remove the threshold for Angel tax exemption for funds raised from residents. This is currently capped at Rs 25 crore (post issue of shares including premium). * Extend the tax holiday benefit of start-ups to partnership / LLP form of entities. Currently only company form is eligible for tax holiday benefits. * For bootstrapping, extend the current capital gains tax exemption given to sale of immovable property that is re-invested in a recognised start-up to sale of shares of other start-ups as well. (So, if a promoter sells their shares in a start-up and reinvests the capital gains into another start-up, allow a tax exemption for such disposal). * Improve patent box regime to make India an attractive place for IP ownership and exploitation. Current provisions limit the patent box regime (tax at rate of 10%) to royalty form of Income only. This regime should include all forms of income (including business income) derived from exploitation of any IP (extended to software/ copyright and not just to patents). * Supplies by Indian entities to overseas branches are exempt from GST, hence, GST on procurements becomes a cost. Providing refund of GST credit should be considered in case of supplies to overseas branches, which currently is a substantial cost for such Indian entities. * Do away with the limited definition of “Industrial Undertaking” in Section 72A of Income Tax Act, so that all mergers, including those in the software / IT sector are eligible for carry forward losses and unabsorbed depreciation.

The attack took place on Peshawar’s Ring Road, within the jurisdiction of Gulbahar police station, a day after the country’s interior minister Sheikh Rasheed Ahmed warned of a spike in terrorist strikes across the country in the next two months. The minister said that sleeper cells of militant outfits at Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in the northwest and Balochistan province in the southwest had become active. Seemingly clueless about the motive behind Sunday's attack, the police said they had no prior information about any specific terror campaign against Christian priests. "Minorities are soft targets and terrorists attack them to spread fear and panic," a local police official told the media. The deceased, pastor William Siraj, took two bullets in the abdomen and died instantly, doctors at the nearby Lady Reading Hospital said. His body was later handed over to his family. The injured priest, identified as Patrick, is being treated in the same hospital. Pakistan is globally seen as an unsafe country for minorities, with scores of Ahmadis, Hindus, Christians and Sikhs being killed in the past, some of them on mere accusations of blasphemy. The worst attack on Christians was reported in 2013, when more than 130 people were killed in blasts inside a church in Peshawar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pastor-shot-dead-fellow-priest-hurt-in-pakistan-terror-attack/articleshow/89230005.cms||Omer Farooq Khan
---||Business||Budget 2022 expectations for pharma: Govt must support innovation & focus to enhance operational efficiency||By Bhanu Prakash Kalmath SJ and Biren VyasIndia holds a special place on the global pharmaceuticals map. The sector has grown at a consistent pace to emerge as the third largest producer, by volume, in the world with a leading position in supply of generic drugs and low-cost vaccines. Last couple of years have seen India’s pharma sector rise to the unprecedented challenge presented by the Covid-19 pandemic. The domestic sector, currently estimated to be around $42 billion, is expected to grow in double digits to reach around $130 billion by 2030. As we look to the future, Indian pharma and biotech companies will need to accelerate their efforts for the next stage of growth by strengthening presence across developed markets and ramp-up new product and technology capabilities through organic and inorganic routes. The sector witnessed major disruptions due to the pandemic which has led players to shift focus towards de-risking of their supply chains and manufacturing operations. Additionally, capacity expansion in sensitive APIs, intermediates, biopharmaceuticals, and medical devices would be critical for growth. India lags on innovation and R&D in pharma as compared to some of the large economies. Impetus on this front would unlock new opportunities for India on the global pharma value chain. The government has undertaken several progressive initiatives to strengthen the domestic manufacturing ecosystem, such as the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes, schemes for promotion of bulk drug parks, medical devices parks, among others. Budget FY2022-23 is expected to build on the momentum and address key challenges faced by the sector to achieve the vision of ‘AatmaNirbhar Bharat’. Focus on Capacity ExpansionEnhanced outlay on Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes will further encourage investments in capacity expansion for sensitive APIs, complex excipients, drug intermediates, biopharmaceuticals, manufacturing of vaccines and medical devices. Previously, Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) benefits were available for specific pharma products under Foreign Trade Policy. However, exclusion of the pharma sector under the Remission of Duties and Taxes Exported Products (RODTEP) scheme launched in January 2021 excludes pharma products from availing benefits, which might deteriorate working capital position. Identification and inclusion of specific pharma products in the revised list of products eligible for the RODTEP scheme would be beneficial for the sector. Support InnovationDue to the current situation and changing business dynamics, pharma entities need to focus on high-end innovation and that too within a short span of time. Therefore, pharma players must invest in the best of the technologies and employ top experts to stay ahead on the innovation curve. Hence, the government of India should consider restoring a higher percentage of deduction for expenses incurred towards R&D under section 35 (2AB) of Income Tax Act. It would encourage innovation and R&D in the country. Currently, regulatory norms for clinical trials take a long time for products imported from developed countries. Even for key products like vaccines, clinical trials and approvals might take more than one year. Streamlining regulatory requirements related to clinical trials without compromising risk would strengthen the sectors’ growth and reduce time to market. Additionally, lower GST for such clinical trials and research and development services would help to grow this sector. Cost impact on taxation of royalty income from the use of Intellectual Properties (IPs) should be minimised at least during the initial few years to bring the latest technology to India. Focus on Operational EfficiencyClarification on ambiguity around allowability of market cost like free sample distribution to medical practitioners under the Income Tax law would put an end to protracted litigation in this sector. Even ambiguity prevailing with regards to availability of input tax credit under the Goods and Services Tax on expenses incurred for Corporate Social Responsibility needs clarification, not only for the pharma sector but beyond as well. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has clarified Transfer Pricing perspective about adjustments of Covid-19 related expenses. However, clarification on a similar line from the authorities regarding Indian Transfer Pricing perspective would help ease its implementation. Further, the extension of reduced tax rate of 15% u/s 115BAB under Income Tax Act to incentivise the existing entities for expansion and capital gains exemption on startup investments would not only help the pharma and medical devices sector, but the industry at large. Guidance from the authorities on these key issues would enable businesses to focus on core activities, enhance operational efficiency and also offer cost-effective products which will improve the affordability aspect of healthcare. Overall, concentrated focus on core sectors like pharma with quick implementation and resolution through the budget would reinforce India’s position as the preferred pharma manufacturing destination in the world.

---||Business||Difference between final and interim budget: All you need to know||NEW DELHI: Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present her 4th budget on February 1. Each year, the incumbent finance minister presents the Union Budget in the month of February which contains a blueprint of the government's revenue and expenditure for the coming fiscal year. However, there are times when the government presents an "interim budget" instead of a full one. Like in February 2019, when then finance minister Piyush Goyal presented an interim budget just a few months before the national election. What is an interim budget? An interim budget is presented by the government when it does not have time to present a full budget. Mostly, it is because the general election is around the corner. Thus, as per tradition, the government of the day leaves the task of framing the full budget to the incoming dispensation after the election results. So why not just let the new government present a full budget? The Union Budget presented by the government is valid till the end of the fiscal year, i.e. March 31. In other words, it gives the government spending rights only up to that date. So when the government is unable to present a full budget before the end of the financial year, it needs parliamentary approval to incur expenses from the time the new financial year kicks off until a new budget is passed. Hence the word "interim". What is vote-on-account? Through the interim budget, Parliament passes a vote-on-account which basically gives the government temporary permission to meet the expenses of the administration until the elections. The vote-on-account is normally valid for two months but can be extended. Are vote-on-account and interim budget different things? An interim budget is technically just like the full budget, but only for a temporary period. Like the Union Budget, it contains a complete set of accounts, including expenditure and receipts. And like the full budget, the estimates are presented for the whole year. However, in the election year, the government usually avoids announcing any major tax changes or schemes in the interim budget even though it is not constitutionally prohibited from doing so. A vote-on-account, on the other hand, deals with only the expenditure side of things. It's passed in Parliament without a formal discussion. Is interim budget mandatory? No. The government can choose not to present an interim budget and just get the funds required for spending via the vote on account route. However, as per convention, the governments usually opt for an interim budget in the election year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/faqs/budget-faqs/difference-between-final-and-interim-budget-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/89230219.cms||---
---||Business||How does government prepare its Union Budget every year||NEW DELHI: Budget is the annual financial statement of a government which lays out fiscal roadmap for the country for the next one year. It is prepared by the ministry of finance in consultation with Niti Aayog and other concerned ministries. The budget division of the department of economic affairs (DEA) in the finance ministry is the nodal body responsible for producing the budget. Budget-making process starts in August-September, that is, about six months prior to its date of presentation. It needs to be passed by both houses of Parliament before beginning of the financial year, that is, April 1. This will be the second year when finance minister Nirmala Sitharam will present the Union Budget in paperless form. Amid the Covid pandemic, the governmet had moved away from the traditional way of printing budget documents and released them via an app. Sitharaman carried a handheld tablet with her, in place of the traditional 'bahi-khata' and read her budget speech from it. Prior to this, budget documents were printed just few days ahead of the budget. Here are the steps involved:* Issuance of circulars to all ministriesA circular is issued to all ministries, states, Union territories, autonomous bodies by the finance ministry asking them to prepare estimates for the coming year. It comprises skeleton forms along with requisite guidelines based on which ministries present their demands. Apart from providing their estimates, the ministries also give a detail of their revenues and expenditures in the past year. * Consultations on proposals received After requests are received, it is then scrutinised by the top officials of the government. Extensive consultations are undertaken between the ministries and the department of expenditure. Upon approval, the data is then sent to the finance ministry. * Allocation of revenues The finance ministry, after going through all recommendations, allocates revenues to various departments for their future expenditures. In case dispute arises over allocation of funds, the finance ministry consults the Union Cabinet or the Prime Minister. Other stakeholders like farmers, small business owners, foreign institutional investors are also consulted by the DEA and department of revenue to gain more insights. * Pre-Budget meetings The finance minister holds pre-budget meetings with various stakeholders to know about their proposals and demands. These stakeholders include state representatives, bankers, agriculturists, economists and trade unions. Once the pre-budget consultations are done, the finance minister takes the final call on all demands. It is also discussed with the Prime Minister before finalisation. * Budget printing/ document finalisation Every year, the government follows an annual tradition of hosting a halwa ceremony, a few days before the Budget is presented. The ceremony marks the beginning of printing of Budget documents. As part of the ritual, 'halwa' is prepared in a big 'kadhai' (large frying pot) and served to the entire staff in the finance ministry. The significance of the event is that after the sweet dish is served, a large number of officials and support staff, who are directly associated with the budget making are required to stay in the ministry and remain cut off from their families till the presentation of the budget. However, printing of documents has been stopped since last year and budget is presented in paperless form. Due to the ongoing third wave of Covid-19, 'halwa' ceremony was not conducted this year. Instead, sweets were distributed to certain members in the ministry of finance who will stay in till the budget documents are compiled and presented in Parliament on February 1. * Presentation of the budgetFinance minister presents the budget in Lok Sabha. Until 2016, it was presented on the last day of February. However, from 2017 the budget has been presented on February 1 every year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/faqs/budget-faqs/how-does-government-prepare-its-union-budget-every-year/articleshow/89230483.cms||---

The remote Himalayan nation of around 8,00,000 people, sandwiched between China and India, has recorded fewer Covid fatalities than almost anywhere else in the world. But Bhutan’s PM Lotay Tshering — a physician who still does surgeries on the weekend as a “de-stresser” from the pressures of office — said this week’s death was “a bitter reminder that we need to do more”. Tshering said in a Facebook post late on Saturday that “it felt like a bullet-hit to learn that one more precious life died with Covid-19. I grieved with the nation and continue to offer my prayers for our dear friend,” he added. The PM said Bhutan remained committed to completely eliminating the disease and said the nation could not afford “to lose our people to something that is preventable”. Bhutan, like much of the world, has seen a surge in infections linked to the highly contagious Omicron variant. Friday’s death came on the same day health authorities reported 205 new coronavirus cases — a national record since the pandemic began. The kingdom has seen fewer than 5,000 cases overall since the disease emerged two years ago, and Bhutan had already vaccinated nearly all of its adult population by the middle of 2021.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bhutan-mourns-rare-covid-death-pm-says-it-felt-like-a-bullet-hit/articleshow/89230513.cms||---

Major cities such as New York and Boston bore the brunt of the blizzard, which the National Weather Service (NWS) confirmed had intensified into a "bomb cyclone" -- characterized by the explosive power of rapid drops in atmospheric pressure. The heaviest-hit parts of New York and Massachusetts received two feet (61 centimeters) of snow by early evening, with more than 95,000 homes in Massachusetts reported without power. Snowfall in Boston equaled the one-day record of 23.6 inches set in 2003, the NWS said, while the town of Sharon, 29 kilometers (18 miles) to the south, had recorded the highest snowfall by 8:30 pm Saturday with more than 30 inches. The towns of Islip, New York, and Warren, Rhode Island, were similarly blanketed. Cold weather stretched as far south as Florida, where the NWS warned of "scattered to isolated falling iguanas from trees" as plunging temperatures temporarily paralyzed the large lizards. Residents in towns and cities across the eastern seaboard were urged to avoid all unnecessary travel for a second night of whiteout conditions, with additional snowfall expected to be heaviest across New England. In Long Island, officials said a woman had been found dead in her car by a snowplow operator. Salt machines and snowplows crawled along the streets of New York City, where Central Park was covered in 7.5 inches of snow and regional train lines were partially shut down. In Times Square, the famous neon billboards formed glowing halos in the snowy air. But the frigid temperatures didn't stop Robert Burck, a Times Square fixture known as the "Naked Cowboy." Wearing only his underwear, a cowboy hat and cowboy boots, he strolled through the nearly empty tourist hotspot, strumming his guitar. "It's fantastic," one undaunted tourist, Gonzalo Vazquez of Spain, told AFP in Times Square. "It's like skiing, surrounded by lights and awesome LED screens." In the trendy Cobble Hill neighborhood in Brooklyn, the sidewalks were almost deserted and many businesses were closed. But the few who did brave the elements smiled as they wished each other "Happy snow day!" New York and the neighboring state of New Jersey plus Virginia, Maryland and Delaware declared emergencies for all or part of the states. New York Governor Kathy Hochul said the storm's perils were not over yet, warning residents Saturday that "the most dangerous phase of the storm is now." "Please continue to avoid any unnecessary travel while our crews are working to clear the roads," she said. In Boston, where a snow emergency was declared, Mayor Michelle Wu tweeted a reminder Saturday "to stay off the roads if you can." Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker said: "This storm is bringing strong winds and lots of snow, with coastal, eastern and southeastern MA communities getting hit particularly hard. "Through mid-morning tomorrow, you should not be traveling unless you absolutely have to." Eric Calessandro, a homeowner in the town of Marshfield near Boston said he had just lost power, but was optimistic his 8,000-watt generator would pull him through. He said he "should be able to bear it out for a couple days without power," adding that he had stocked up on food and water in advance. Boston Public Works said 900 snowplows were hard at work on the city streets. Plow driver Mark Burns, working in Boston's South Shore area, said the snow had gotten heavy: "It was supposed to be light and fluffy, but it's a little wet now." More than 3,500 flights were canceled for Saturday traveling within, into or out of the United States, according to flight tracker FlightAware, and just over 1,200 flights had already been canceled for Sunday. The blizzard comes on the heels of a similar winter storm that blanketed a swath of eastern North America -- from Georgia to Canada -- just two weeks ago, cutting power to thousands of homes and also disrupting thousands of flights.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/boston-ties-snow-record-as-bomb-cyclone-batters-eastern-us/articleshow/89230541.cms||---

Usually, the duration of the presentation ranges from 90 to 120 minutes. Sitharaman's Budget 2020-21 speech was the longest in terms of duration in independent India's history. It continued approximately for two hours 40 minutes. With two pages still remaining, she had to cut short her speech as she felt unwell. She asked the Speaker to consider the remaining part of the speech as read. In 2019 as well, Sitharaman had delivered a marathon budget speech that lasted 2 hours 17 minutes, going past Jaswant Singh's record of two hours 15 minutes in 2003. Her speech in 2019 was peppered with Urdu, Hindi and Tamil couplets. In terms of the number of words, in 1991, Manmohan Singh, then finance minister in the Narasimha Rao government, delivered the longest Budget speech so far, which comprised 18,650 words. Sitharaman's 2020 speech had 13,275 words. Former finance minister Arun Jaitley, who passed away in 2019, holds the record for the second-longest speech comprising 18,604 words, delivered in 2018. Jaitley's Budget speeches in 2015 (18,122 words), 2018 (17,991 words) and 2014 (16,528) hold the third, fourth and fifth spots, respectively. The shortest speech award comprising just 800 words went to H M Patel in 1977 when he presented the interim budget.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/faqs/budget-faqs/union-budget-how-long-is-the-finance-ministers-speech/articleshow/89230574.cms||---

The five states with the largest death row populations as on December 31, 2021 were Uttar Pradesh (86), Maharashtra (41), West Bengal (38), Bihar (37) and Madhya Pradesh (37), according to the report, prepared by Project 39A under the aegis of the National Law University, Delhi, which researches and offers pro bono legal aid in death penalty cases. Trial courts imposed 144 death sentences in 2021 compared to 77 in 2020 and 104 in 2019. Murder cases accounted for the largest block in 2021 – 62 out of 144, compared to 48 for sexual violence. However, the 48 death sentences for sexual violence were imposed in 45 cases while the 62 for murder came out of 34 cases. Sexual offences accounted for 54% of all cases that resulted in a death sentence, according to the report. “This indicates that sexual violence cases continue to heavily influence the implementation of death penalty in India, even if the proportion of sexual violence cases has decreased from that of 2019 and 2020 when it was at 61.6% and 59.7% respectively,” the report added. The five states where the maximum number of death sentences were imposed in 2021 were UP, Bihar (27), Tamil Nadu (15), Andhra Pradesh (13) and Odisha (9). But in a shift in the higher judiciary, for the first time in the six years since Project 39A started publishing its reports, the Supreme Court did not confirm a single death sentence in 2021. It adjudicated on the sentences of nine prisoners, of whom five had their death sentences commuted to life and four were acquitted of all charges. At the same time, 2021 also witnessed legislative changes where the death penalty was introduced for newer categories – for instance, at the Centre, the ministry of women and child development’s Bill on human trafficking. In the states, the Punjab and Madhya Pradesh Houses brought in death sentences for sale or manufacture of spurious liquor, while legislators in Maharashtra unanimously approved a Bill introducing the death penalty for ‘heinous’ offences of rape and gang rape.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/2021-saw-21-jump-in-prisoners-on-death-row-to-488/articleshow/89230624.cms||Himanshi Dhawan

While Zydus Cadila’s ZyCoV-D was granted emergency use authorisation on August 20 last year, the authorisation was given to Serum Institute’s Covovax on December 28 and to Biologocal E’s Corbevax on December 29. Experts claimed that this was the right time to expedite the rollout of the approved vaccines because the government had started the vaccination of adolescents and precautionary doses were being administered to the vulnerable population and frontline workers. A leading public health expert though said the three vaccines’ manufacturers would have to ensure enough supplies before the rollout was announced. Currently, only Covaxin is being administered to children, while all the three vaccines rolled out last year —Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik V — are being used as precaution doses. Experts felt that the rollout of Covovax, Corbevax and ZyCov-D would have strengthened the vaccine basket of India against Covid-19. Officials from the Union health ministry admitted that the firms’ production capacity was an issue in introducing these three vaccines in the current programme. He said with most of the population vaccinated with Covishield and Covaxin, the focus of the new vaccines would be in poorly-vaccinated areas, especially in the north-eastern states. A senior official from the Union health ministry said they had placed orders for new vaccines for the states and areas with poor vaccination. “We should start getting the supply of at least ZyCovD in approximately a month’s time. The other two should also be included shortly,” said the official. Maharashtra had placed an order for nearly 14 lakh doses for areas with poor first dose vaccination. “We had got the sanction in November, but we are yet to receive the vaccines,” said a senior public health official of the state. A senior member of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation in India (NTAGI) told TOI that at the moment, the total number of ZyCov-D doses is limited to about one crore only.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/3-shots-okayed-last-year-still-not-part-of-vaccination-drive/articleshow/89230703.cms||Nisha Nambiar

---||Business||Budget: What are the different types of deficit and how they impact economy||NEW DELHI: Budget deficit occurs when expenditures exceed revenues received. It is usually expressed as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP). A deficit may arise in case government spends more during a year either due to unanticipated events like a disaster or calamity or introduces certain policy changes to spur economic activities. High deficits may sometimes lead to inflationary pressures in the economy. An effective way to reduce them is to reduce regulations, lower corporate taxes and improve business confidence. Here are the different types of budget deficit: * Revenue deficitWhen total revenue expenditure exceeds total revenue receipts it leads to revenue deficit. It indicates shortage of funds with the government even for maintaining its day-to-day affairs. Government often resorts to borrowing or divestment to cover up the shortage. It may also introduce new taxes or increase the existing taxes. The Centre is likely to incur a high revenue deficit this year again owing to increased spending due to the coronavirus pandemic. * Fiscal deficit Fiscal deficit is the negative balance that arises whenever a government spends more money than it receives in the form of taxes and other revenues. The number is one of the most keenly observed figures during the Budget. It assumes significance especially now as the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has necessitated the government to undertake many measures to uplift a sluggish economy. During April-November, the first eight months of current fiscal year, fiscal deficit narrowed to 46.2 per cent of the full-year budgeted target, helped by a rise in tax collections. The fiscal deficit had surged to 135.1 per cent of the full-year target during the same period last fiscal year. It stood at Rs 6.96 lakh crore ($93.7 billion) against Rs 15.07 lakh crore target for the whole fiscal year. * Primary deficitPrimary deficit is arrived at by deducting interest payments on previous borrowings from the current year's fiscal deficit. In other words, it is the amount of government borrowing excluding interest payments. A zero primary deficit indicates the need for government borrowing to meet interest payments. A shrinking primary deficit indicates improving fiscal health of an economy.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/faqs/budget-faqs/budget-what-are-the-different-types-of-deficit-and-how-they-impact-economy/articleshow/89230765.cms||---

He cited examples how people gave a heartfelt farewell to a tigress, known as ‘Collar Wali Baghin’, who died recently at the Pench Tiger Reserve in Madhya Pradesh and how people in Assam launched a huge campaign against poaching to save rhinoceros. He also mentioned about a horse, Virat, who led this year’s Republic Day parade as Commandant Charger for last time and was given a grand farewell on the occasion. Noting that “love for nature and compassion for every living being” is Indian culture as well as the innate nature of people, Modi said, “A glimpse of these ‘sanskaras (culture)’ of ours was seen recently when a tigress left the world in MP. The death of this tigress made people so emotional as if someone of their own had left the world. People performed her last rites, bid her farewell with full respect and affection... This love of Indians for nature and living beings was greatly appreciated the world over.” The collared tigress, named by the forest department as T-15, gave birth to 29 cubs in her lifetime. Citing another such example, Modi said, “In this R-Day parade, the charger mount of the President’s Bodyguard, Virat took part in his last parade. Horse Virat came to Rashtrapati Bhavan in 2003 and used to lead the parade every time on Republic Day as Commandant Charger.” He said: “On September 22 last year, more than 2,400 horns seized from smugglers were burnt. This was a stern message to the poachers. The result of such efforts is that now there is a steady decrease in the hunting of rhinos in Assam.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/love-for-nature-animals-is-indian-culture-says-modi/articleshow/89230836.cms||---

Union home minister Amit Shah unveiled a mural of the Mahatma at the Sabarmati riverfront on the occasion of Martyrs’ Day. “Mahatma Gandhi not just fought for India’s freedom but also offered many ways to rebuild the country after it had achieved freedom,” the home minister said. “He advocated swadeshi, satyagraha, swabhasha, sadhan shuddhi, aparigraha (non-possessiveness), prayer, fasting, and simplicity.” Read AlsoPeople remember Bapu but have forgotten Khadi, PM Modi revived it: Amit ShahAHMEDABAD (GUJARAT): Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday said that people remember Mahatma Gandhi but have forgotten the importance of Khadi but asserted that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has revived Khadi.

The apex consumer forum held that homebuyers will be liable to pay maintenance charge for their flats only after the builder gets Occupancy Certificate from the civic authority and it is not proper for builders to demand it even though the flat buyers start residing in their flats after taking over the possession. It said if the builder fails to get OC then it means that the project is not yet fully complete and it would be considered only as “paper possession” if the flat is handed over to the buyers. Read Also8. More relief for homebuyers who get the short endHomebuyers of flats that do not have occupation certificates (OC) because of the delay on the part of builders need not pay maintenance fee until the required certificate is issued, the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission has ruled. The apex consumer forum held that homebuyers will beThe NCDRC allowed a plea of a batch of 15 homebuyers from Benguluru who were compelled by a builder to pay maintenance charges after taking possession of their flats without OC. Their lawyer Chandrachur Bhattacharya contended before a bench of S M Kanitkar and Binoy Kumar that the buyers were forced to pay two year maintenance in advance while taking possession of the flats for which the builder failed to get OC despite a delay of six years. Opposing homebuyers’ plea, the builder VDB Whitefield Development Private Ltd contended that maintenance charge was being charged as it was providing all facilities to those who have shifted to their flats. It said that delay in the project was caused because of Covid-19 pandemic and it was the buyers who had forced it to give them physical possession of their units without OC. The NCDRC, however, was not convinced with the submission of the builders and allowed the plea of homebuyers by relying upon a recent judgment delivered by the Supreme Court in January and an earlier verdict of the Commission. “Regarding the issue of maintenance charges, it is a fact that the complainants have taken physical possession of their respective units. It would be logical that there would be an expense on the maintenance of certain common services. It is also a fact that the Occupancy Certificate has not been obtained yet. It means that the project is not yet fully complete and that not all services promised are being provided. No maintenance charge should be levied before obtaining the occupancy certificate,” it said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ncdrc-tightens-the-screws-on-builders-for-occupancy-papers/articleshow/89230937.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

The proposals are part of the government think tank’s initiative to propagate electric vehicles, especially charging infrastructure, and domestic manufacturing. The draft policy under discussion has also recommended supply of renewable energy to the charging facilities in line with Railways’ goal to become “Net-Zero Carbon Emitter” by 2030, official sources told TOI. Niti Aayog has suggested railways could start with the 123 railway stations that have been redeveloped and subsequently all suburban stations should have charging provision. As part of the plan, it has been proposed that the railway could recognise that there is significant scope to add EV charging infrastructure in the list of public amenities at the major railway stations. In any case, given the development of payment tools in the country, UPI or Fastag could be used for the purpose given that RailTel infrastructure is available across the country. “Railway stations are landmark locations and they play a unique role in the entire transport sector which make them strategic locations for providing public charging solutions for EVs. They serve as important multi-modal transit nodes and thus, attract high volumes of traffic from various commuters, taxis, freight forwarders, etc. Plus, suburban railway stations serve a large number of daily commuters and act as pick-up and drop points for last-mile connectivity. So, there will be charging demand from private as well as paratransit vehicles,” an officer said. Government sources said given the relevance of battery swapping technique, particularly for electric two- and three-wheelers, Railways has also been asked to consider the operational requirements of a stack battery charging system.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/niti-prods-railways-to-create-infrastructure-for-electric-vehicles-at-stations/articleshow/89230987.cms||Surojit Gupta
---||India||Original PoA not needed, copy enough to sell property: Supreme Court||NEW DELHI: In a big warning to property owners who intend to sell their assets through a power of attorney (PoA) holder, the Supreme Court has ruled that the PoA holder can sell the property and register the sale by merely producing a copy of the PoA and that the original was not mandatory for registration of the sale. This means, if the property owner orally cancels the PoA and takes back the original document without entering into a written agreement on cancellation of the PoA, it would still allow the PoA holder to sell the property or land with the help of a copy of the original PoA document. A bench of Justices K M Joseph and P S Narasima said, "On an analysis of the provisions (of the Registration Act), we have no hesitation in rejecting the argument of the plaintiff that the non-production of the original power of attorney by the second defendant was fatal to a valid registration being effected." In the case in hand, the owner of the property (plaintiff) had entered into an agreement with a person for sale of his land for Rs 55,000 in 1987. As he was transferred out of the place, he executed a PoA for concluding the sale. The sale, however, didn't materialise. So, he took back the original PoA and told the person that the PoA stood terminated. But the erstwhile PoA holder applied for a copy of the registered PoA and went ahead with the sale for Rs 30,000 to the same defendant, who had earlier agreed to buy it for Rs 55,000. He went to the Registrar's office and got the sale registered with a copy of the PoA. The Himachal Pradesh high court cancelled the registration of the sale saying non-production of original PoA document was fatal to the sale and restored the property to the owner. The SC set aside the HC order and said the registration was valid as oral cancellation of PoA has no validity before the law and that for registration of sale of land, the PoA holder merely is required to produce a copy of the document and that original was not necessary. Writing the judgment, Justice Joseph said, "...The inquiry contemplated under the Registration Act, cannot extend to question as to whether the person who executed the document in his capacity of the power of attorney holder of the principal, was indeed having a valid power of attorney or not to execute the document or not." Justice Joseph said, "Section 35 of the Registration Act gives authority to the registering authority to satisfy himself that the persons appearing before him are the persons they represent to be... the aforesaid provision deals with situations in which the registering authority refuses the registration. If the registering authority is satisfied about the identity of the person..., it may not be part of the Registrar's duty to enquire further."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/original-poa-not-needed-copy-enough-to-sell-property-supreme-court/articleshow/89231055.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Two Rajkot brothers were arrested by the special operations group of the state police on charges of supplying the pistol and five cartridges to the alleged mastermind, identified as Maulana Qamar Ganhi Islami. The cleric had been previously charged with fomenting communal violence in Tripura and booked under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act last November, an ATS official said. "Islami was stepping out of an office belonging to his organisation Tehreek-e-Farogh-e-Islami when he was stopped and arrested," the official said. "In April 2021, he had posted a video on social media in which he makes a provocative speech calling for a backlash against people who post blasphemous material. In another of his speeches, he says one can go to any extent to punish a person who makes blasphemous statements against Islam." The ATS said Islami had been in touch with Shabbir Chopda, who allegedly murdered Bharwad on January 25, and Imtiyaz Pathan, who was riding the motorcycle in which the duo travelled. Chopda would follow Islami on social media and had met him several times. ATS officials claim Islami gave Chopda the murder weapon and helped him chalk out the plot. The two brothers suspected of procuring the pistol and ammunition were identified as Azim Bashir Sama, a resident of Dudhsagar Road in Rajkot, and his sibling Wasim. Both have been handed over to the ATS for interrogation. Six people, including Chopda and Jamalpur-based cleric Mohammed Ayyub Javrawala, have been arrested in the case so far.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/man-killed-over-islam-postguj-cops-arrest-delhi-cleric/articleshow/89231072.cms||---

India recorded just over 17.5 lakh fresh cases during the week ending Sunday (January 24-30), down 19% from the preceding week, strengthening the view that the third wave may have peaked at the national level although some states may continue to report a surge in cases. There was, however, a 10% drop in testing during the current week as compared to the previous seven days. Despite that, India's test positivity rate in the week dipped to 15.68% as opposed to 17.28% in the previous week. Last week (January 17-23), the country had reported nearly 21.7 lakh new cases, the highest in the current surge. If nationwide cases do continue to fall in the coming days, the third wave would be by far the shortest yet, having peaked in just four weeks. Cases had started rising in the last week of December. Covid deaths continue to rise although the overall numbers so far remain the lowest of the three waves. India reported more than 3,770 new deaths during the week, up from 2,680 in the previous seven days. These figures do not include deaths from earlier periods added to the official count. If these fatalities are added to the count, India's toll rose by 5,203 during the current week. The daily death toll stayed over 550 for the third day running, with 564 fatalities reported on Sunday. Data from two states was awaited till late Sunday night. More than 2.1 lakh were reported during the day, a dip from Saturday's tally of 2.34 lakh.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/weekly-cases-down-first-time-in-third-wave-deaths-up-41/articleshow/89231095.cms||Amit Bhattacharya

"Going by epidemiology, children are getting infected with Covid in the third wave, though testing is on a lower scale. The disease is mostly mild. As was seen in other countries, we have not seen any multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) during the past one-and-a-half months of the third wave," he said. MIS-C is a serious condition that appears to be linked to Covid. According to Mayo Clinic, the heart, lungs, blood vessels, kidneys, digestive system, brain, skin and eyes become severely inflamed in kids with MIS-C.

Singh said this had to be reiterated as some cases had come to the notice of the department of pension and pensioners' welfare, of banks not allowing family pension in respect of a mentally challenged child, through the person nominated by the pensioner or his/her spouse, and insisting on a guardianship certificate issued by a court of law. The MoS said the Modi government follows the mantra of 'good governance' and 'ease of living' for the common man. In that spirit, the provision for nomination for family pension is intended to avoid any hassle to the child suffering from a mental disability in obtaining guardianship certificate from the court or in claiming family pension after parents' death. "Insisting for a guardianship certificate by a bank in such cases defeats the purpose of such nomination and amounts to violation of the statutory provisions of Central Civil Service (Pension) Rules, 2021," he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/child-with-mental-disability-is-entitled-to-family-pension-govt/articleshow/89231160.cms||---

According to an agency report, Air India filed the appeal in the US court on Thursday, the same day the Tata Group took over the management of the airline. A source in the civil aviation ministry, on condition of anonymity, confirmed the development without elaborating further. Tata Sons has, however, not responded to an email query from TOI on the airline moving the US court. The district court in New York can dismiss and dispose of the Devas case entirely based on Air India’s request or it can identify remaining issues in the case if the demand is denied, according to a filing by the airline. Devas Multimedia, which is now under the control of a liquidator, is currently facing liquidation proceedings after the Supreme Court order. on January 17, upheld the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal ruling to wind up the Bengaluru-based company. Devas, which is seeking $1.2 billion from the government of India, will continue to confiscate cash generated from some ticket sales overseas by Air India, said Matthew McGill, a partner at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher that represents several Devas shareholders. The firm has already seized assets worth more than $30 million owned by Air India, he claimed. In fact, soon after the Supreme Court ordered on January 17 to wind up the company, Devas counsel Matthew D McGill said, “The decision by the Supreme Court does not change anything. The Modi government and the Indian courts cannot rewrite the facts. Their flimsy allegations of fraud will never stand up in courts outside of India”. He had, however, said, “A better approach for the Modi government would be to return to the negotiating table, and continue with settlement talks.” International arbitration tribunals had awarded Devas a compensation of $1.2 billion for the cancelled satellite deal with Antrix and on the basis of those awards, the company has been seeking seizure of Indian government assets abroad by pursuing legal cases in Canada, France and the US. Devas shareholders have been allowed by a Canada court in Quebec province to seize 50% of Air India funds, estimated to be around $23 million, lying with global airlines body IATA and have also got a French court order for freezing an upscale apartment in Paris that houses India’s deputy chief of mission and is valued at 3.8 million euro.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/air-india-moves-us-court-to-prevent-devas-demand-for-recovery-of-1-2-billion-arbitration-awards/articleshow/89231193.cms||Surendra Singh

Indications that Channi could be the one to get the nod for the leadership position, in the wake of Rahul Gandhi’s announcement that Congress will come out with a CM face, became stronger after the party on Sunday announced his name for a second assembly seat of Bhadaur, along with his traditional seat of Chamkaur Sahib. Read Also3. Cong fields Punjab CM Channi from two seatsThe Congress party on Sunday declared its third list of its candidates for the upcoming Punjab Assembly election. And chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi will contest from two seats — Chamkaur Sahib in Rupnagar district and Bhadaur in Barnala district. The known: Chamkaur Sahib is Channi'sThe move is seen as a result of the feedback in Congress as well as pressure from strategists that Channi’s special appeal to the Dalit community needs to be harnessed across regions. The feedback also suggested that Congress needed to come out with its CM candidate in view of Aam Aadmi Party naming comedian-turned-MP Bhagwant Mann as its CM candidate. Sources said Congress will look for a special occasion to name the CM candidate. While in the Congress scheme of things, a sitting chief minister is the automatic CM candidate in polls, the uncertainty in Punjab stemmed from a strong claim to the leadership position made by state unit president and maverick politician Navjot Singh Sidhu. His unrelenting stance has been a source of trouble in the state unit, which has seen a roller-coaster ride ever since dissent broke out against Captain Amarinder Singh last year, finally ending with his eviction as the chief minister.  Assembly elections 2022: Complete coverage Poll schedule Detailed coverage UP elections Punjab elections Uttarakhand elections Goa elections Manipur elections The fact that Rahul Gandhi announced during his Punjab rally last week that both Sidhu and Channi had urged him to announce a CM candidate and promised to support the person suggests that party managers have done the ground work to ensure that the candidate who gets left out does not throw a fit. However, it is to be seen how the issue actually pans out once the announcement is made. It is probably for the first time that Punjab is witnessing a serious multi-cornered contest, as turmoil in Congress over the past one year culminated in the departure of Amarinder Singh and his tie-up with BJP. A section of farmers has also jumped into the fray as Sanyukt Samaj Morcha, creating five fronts on the face of it along with AAP and Akali Dal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/punjab-assembly-elections-congress-leaning-towards-making-channi-cm-face/articleshow/89231229.cms||---

He also said Goa was just a vacation spot for the Gandhi family but BJP had brought development to the state. He slammed the parties from outside Goa that are contesting the February 14 state elections, including Trinamool Congress (TMC) and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), saying they did not understand the difficulties of Goans and had no solution to their problems, whereas the Modi government had given priority to development of small states like Goa. Shah also criticised the Congress and the party's former Goa chief minister Digambar Kamat for "devastating" the state through his government's "misrule", and asserted that in the last 10 years, BJP had provided a stable government and brought development in the state. "Congress's Gandhi family has a habit of going on holidays, so they want a tourism spot for vacation. They come here often. For BJP, Goa means 'golden Goa', but for Congress it is 'Gandhi parivar ka Goa'. Do you want (BJP's) golden Goa or Gandhi parivar ka Goa?" he asked addressing an indoor public meet at Ponda in South Goa. In Panaji, Shah assured that the iron ore mining industry in the state, which became non-operational nearly four years back, would start functioning with "double force" through a transparent auctioning process after the assembly elections.

Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday announced that he was ready for any challenge. The SP chief took to Twitter on Sunday afternoon to announce that he was ready for any challenge. I am ready for every challenge right away ... truth will require no preparation... inform me about the place and time," Akhilesh tweeted. The former UP CM's tweet is being seen in the light of Amit Shah's recent visit to Muzaffarnagar where, addressing a 'Matdata Samvad' (interaction with voters) on Saturday, he attacked Akhilesh saying that SP was not ashamed of making false claims and utters lies so fluently that some might assume them to be true. This was in reference to Akhilesh's allegations of poor law and order situation in UP under Yogi regime. "If he has the courage, he should carry the statistics of his regime and address a press conference," Shah had said.  Assembly elections 2022: Complete coverage Poll schedule Detailed coverage UP elections Punjab elections Uttarakhand elections Goa elections Manipur elections The Union home minister dismissed Akhilesh's allegation as "blatant lies" claiming that the crime data speaks otherwise. "In the last five years, incidents of dacoity and robbery have gone down by 70% and 69.3% respectively. The count of murders has dipped by 30%," Shah said. "We are in this election after fulfilling more than 95% of the promises that we made in our last poll manifesto," Shah said. Akhilesh also attacked BJP over fielding candidates with criminal records. He said, "BJP is all set to make a century of fielding candidates with criminal backgrounds. They have given tickets to 99 candidates so far and are about to cross the 100-mark." This was in response to allegations leveled by BJP leaders.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/akhilesh-accepts-shah-dare-to-debate-on-law-and-order/articleshow/89231317.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

Khan joined the party in the presence of former UP BJP chief and chairman of joining committee Laxmikant Bajpai. Former BSP MLA Shivcharan Prajapati also joined the saffron party along with his supporters. "Women have been safe under BJP rule," stressed Khan, who once termed Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi as her sister. She insisted that BJP's fight against triple talaq brought her closer to the party.  Assembly elections 2022: Complete coverage Poll schedule Detailed coverage UP elections Punjab elections Uttarakhand elections Goa elections Manipur elections She said that criminalisation of instant Triple Talaq have diminished the ordeals of Muslim women to a great extent. "Earlier, when I ran an institution, women used to visit it thrice or four times a week and confide they were given triple talaq by their husbands on trivial issues," she said. Khan's induction, analysts said, could arm BJP to blunt opposition aggrssive Muslim outreach, especially in the west and Rohilkhand region which go to polls in the first three phases. She took a swipe at Congress saying that the party gave the name of the campaign 'Ladki Hoon, Lad Sakti Hoon' but did not do anything for women safety. This comes after Congress' campaign face, Priyanka Maurya, defected to the saffron camp. Nida is the former wife of Sheeran Raza Khan, the son of Usman Raza Khan of Ala Hazarat clan of Bareilly. Usman Raza Khan is the elder brother of Tauqeer Raza Khan. Sheeran divorced Nida through instant triple talaq within a year of their marriage. But Nida waged a court battle against this and also became an activist, extending help to other women.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cleric-backs-cong-his-triple-talaq-victim-ex-bahu-joins-bjp/articleshow/89231348.cms||---

Sources told TOI that the commission is likely to further ease the restrictions on physical campaign in view of the acceleration in vaccination rates in the poll-going states, with even UP having achieved 99% coverage of Dose 1. However, the quantum of relaxations to be given will depend on inputs from the health secretary as well as the chief secretaries and chief electoral officers of the states concerned.  Assembly elections 2022: Complete coverage Poll schedule Detailed coverage UP elections Punjab elections Uttarakhand elections Goa elections Manipur elections The likely options before EC include raising the limit of persons who can attend the political rallies in open grounds beyond 500 to the existing SDMA limit in respective states/districts. While physical rallies subject to a cap of 500 persons or 50% of the ground capacity or SDMA limit, whichever is lesser, was allowed by EC on January 22 for Phase 1 polling due on February 10, a similar relaxation will be allowed from Tuesday for constituencies going to polls in Phase 2 due on February 14. EC will also weigh if similar relaxations are to be allowed only for a few more phases or for all the remaining phases. While 58 assembly constituencies will vote in the first phase on February 10, 55 seats in UP and the whole of Goa and Uttarakhand will go to polls on February 14. On January 22, EC had extended the ban on full-fledged physical rallies, roadshows, padyatras and vehicle rallies until January 31 but allowed in-person public meetings with maximum 500 persons or up to 50% of the ground capacity or extant SDMA limit, whichever is less, between January 28 and February 8 in constituencies going to polls in the first phase and between February 1 and 12 for 55 constituencies in UP and the whole of Goa and Uttarakhand. While allowing physical meetings in the open for initial two phases earlier, EC had gone by two factors - the vaccination coverage in poll-bound states, which has been showing improvement since, as well as hospitalisation rates, which continue to be in check in the poll-bound states.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/poll-curbs-may-be-eased-as-ec-to-review-ban-on-rallies-today/articleshow/89231372.cms||---

The family court in Bandra, in December, also noted its own struggle to get a review board to assess and get the woman released, seven years after the hospital had discharged her, but her husband declined to take her home. "This is a case, where only because the wife was not allowed in the matrimonial home, she had to languish in a mental hospital for more than a decade even after her discharge," family court judge Swati Chauhan said. The couple was married in 1993. On the man's application about the wife's mental health, a metropolitan magistrate in 2009 passed a 'reception order' based on which she was sent to the mental hospital. In 2012, her husband filed for divorce on the grounds of "cruelty and unsoundness of mind". Judge Chauhan heard the case for the first time in October 2021. "The Mental Healthcare Act 2017 promulgates to protect, promote and fulfill the rights of such persons during delivery of mental healthcare and service and matters connected therewith. However, this court found it arduous to search and lay hands on the mental health review board. Unfortunately, the respondent-wife could not benefit from the new law and her melancholy continued," the family court order said. The court said in 2014, the medical superintendent, in compliance with the Act, had ordered the woman's discharge as she was found fit. The wife and a nurse were sent home, but the husband "refused to keep her in the matrimonial home" and she was again 'detained' at the mental hospital. The court said, "This is a classic example of how a reception order was misused to literally drive out a wife from the matrimonial home and thereafter restrict her reentry", saying it was "most aghast" at the reason given that the divorce case was pending. The court said it was "equally disturbing" that no one checked on her while she was at the hospital, neither her child on turning a major, nor her brother. The husband initially said he would house her at a shelter home and bear all expenses. But the court counselled him, who said he would find a house for her nearby. But on November 27, when the court directed her immediate discharge, he said he will take her home.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/decade-old-divorce-battle-ends-in-reunion/articleshow/89231402.cms||Swati Deshpande

The seat has a total of 90,638 voters, of which nearly half (42,075) are women. From the first assembly elections in 2002 to the one in 2012, BJP leader Vijaya Barthwal won from the seat for three straight terms. In 2002, she defeated Sarojini Kaintura of Congress by a margin of 1,447 votes. In 2007, she defeated Renu Bisht of Congress by 2,841 votes and in 2012, won again with a comfortable margin. She also served as a cabinet minister in the governments of B C Khanduri and Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank.  Assembly elections 2022: Complete coverage Poll schedule Detailed coverage UP elections Punjab elections Uttarakhand elections Goa elections Manipur elections In 2017, BJP gave the Yamkeshwar ticket to Ritu Khanduri, daughter of former chief minister BC Khanduri, and she also won from here. This time, BJP has fielded Renu Bisht, who had contested as an independent from the seat in 2017 and got the maximum votes after Khanduri. Bisht is up against six other male contenders from the seat and if she wins, Yamkeshwar's reputation as a 'women's bastion' will remain. Doon-based analyst Anoop Nautiyal said, "It looks more like a coincidence than a well-crafted strategy by parties. That said, women are the backbone of democracy in hills, outnumbering men in 33 of 34 hill assembly seats during the 2017 assembly polls." Incidentally, apart from gram sabhas, participation of women in mainstream politics in the state remains low. At present, besides Ritu Khanduri in Yamkeshwar, there are only four female MLAs in Uttarakhand.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/this-uttarakhand-seat-has-seen-only-women-winners-since-21-yrs/articleshow/89231412.cms||Gaurav Talwar

Some parked on the grounds of the National War Memorial and danced on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, others carried signs and flags with swastikas and some used the statue of Canadian hero Terry Fox to display an anti-vaccine statement, sparking widespread condemnation. "I am sickened to see protesters dance on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and desecrate the National War Memorial. Generations of Canadians have fought and died for our rights, including free speech, but not this. Those involved should hang their heads in shame," tweeted General Wayne Eyre, Canada's defence staff chief. Protesters compared vaccine mandates to fascism, one truck carried a Confederate flag and many carried expletive-laden signs targeting Canadian PM Justin Trudeau. The convoy of truckers and others prompted police to prepare for the possibility of violence and warn residents to avoid downtown. A top parliament security official advised lawmakers to lock their doors amid reports their private homes may be targeted. Trudeau has said Canadians are not represented by this "very troubling, small but very vocal minority of Canadians..." The PM's itinerary for the day usually says he is in Ottawa if he's at home, but on Saturday it said "National Capital Region" amid a report he's been moved to an undisclosed location. One of Trudeau's kids has Covid-19 and the PM has been isolating and working remotely. Some are, in part, protesting a new rule that took effect January 15 requiring truckers entering Canada be fully immunised against the coronavirus. The Canadian Trucking Alliance said a great number of the protesters have no connection to the trucking industry. The alliance notes the vast majority of drivers are vaccinated. The organisers of the protest have called for the elimination of all Covid-19 restrictions and vaccine mandates and some called for the removal of Trudeau.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/trudeau-moved-to-secret-location-as-thousands-protest-covid-curbs/articleshow/89231462.cms||---

August 2021 had seen 756 deaths during the second-wave peak. However, Karnataka registered a record number of deaths during the brutal second wave for four months last year: April saw 2,956 deaths, May 13,567, June 5,950 and July 1,522 fatalities. At least 360 (or nearly 60%) of the 607 deaths in January this year came in one week — January 24-30. This includes 68 Covid deaths on Sunday. While there has been an increase in absolute numbers, the overall death rate in the state is under control. As of January 30, the state has cumulatively reported 38,942 deaths out of nearly 37.8 lakh cases. As on Sunday, the case fatality rate is 0.24% compared to nearly 1% as of December 31. Health experts and government officials saw no reason for concern as Covid-19 was not the sole or primary reason for the death of many patients who were already in hospital for other ailments. To ensure Covid death figures provide a clear picture about the pandemic, health officials will soon conduct a state-wide audit to zero in on deaths exclusively or predominantly caused by Covid-19 infection. "Every district conducts its own death audit. Our officers plan to collate this data from all districts, correct the format, and interpret after setting up a common protocol for the same," health commissioner Randeep D told TOI. The clinical expert committee has so far identified that a significant number of deaths have been among patients who were admitted to hospital not because of Covid. "There have been instances where patients were admitted due to completely different medical reasons and as a result of mandatory swab testing, they were found to be Covid positive. On the demise of such a patient, protocol requires the medical staff to slot it as a Covid death even if that was not the reason," Randeep added. He said medical staff have been conducting swab tests on recently deceased patients and reporting their death as ‘Covid death' if result turns out positive. The committee plans to meet on Monday and categorise deaths caused directly or indirectly by Covid. Dr MK Sudarshan, chairperson, the state Covid-19 Technical Advisory Committee, said his team looks forward to uncovering social and medical causes during the audit. Social causes such as delay in testing, treatment or hospitalisation can be addressed through public education, he said. The total positivity rate has come down from since 22.8% on January 22 to 16.3% as on Sunday on the back of reduction in the number of daily tests conducted. On a possible fourth wave, Sudarshan said: "If a new variant of concern arrives, then we will have the fourth wave. Severity depends on the virulence of the virus, how people maintain health protocols, and vaccine coverage and effectiveness."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/607-virus-deaths-in-jan-states-highest-since-august-2021/articleshow/89231594.cms||Sanika Athavale

The leopard, which was found severely injured along the speedway, was sent to the Rohtak zoo for treatment. It is the 11th leopard to have died in a road accident in south Haryana in the past 15 years. According to wildlife officials, the leopard’s backbone had suffered several fractures and there was internal bleeding too. “The animal died during treatment. There were critical wounds around the back. It was unable to move and succumbed to the injuries on Sunday,” said Rajesh Chahal, the wildlife inspector in Gurgaon. It was around 9am on Saturday that the injured leopard was spotted along the road by one of the villagers. The animal was hit by a vehicle between Tauru and Padheni village of Nuh district. After being informed by villagers, a team of wildlife department officials from Gurgaon rushed to the spot with nets, a cage and a tranquiliser gun. The leopard was taken to the Rohtak zoo for treatment. Activists called for more underpasses along highways in the Aravalis. “The state government should carry out a study on leopards and construct underpasses along the expressways. I do not know what the government is waiting for. We are losing out on leopards every year,” said Vaishali Rana Chandra, a wildlife activist. The Wildlife Institute of India (WII) report in 2017 had categorically pointed out that the Aravalis belt was a rich leopard habitat and there was an abundance of wildlife in this part of the state. The forests of south Haryana have a jackal population of 166, in addition to 31 leopards, 26 jungle cats, 91 porcupines, 50 mongoose, 126 hyenas, three wolves, four foxes, and 61 civets. The region, however, has seen multiple leopard deaths along the highways. In June last year, a two-year-old female leopard died after being hit by a vehicle on the Pali road near Asola Bhati wildlife sanctuary in Faridabad. In October 2019, an 18-month-old female leopard was crushed to death.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/leopard-dies-a-day-after-being-hit-by-vehicle-on-e-way-in-nuh/articleshow/89231595.cms||Ipsita Pati

But the land on which the road lies is termed ‘gair mumkin pahar’ (uncultivable hill) in the revenue records, which makes non-forest activities such as cutting trees and constructions illegal there. The matter of the road is already in the National Green Tribunal (NGT), and a hearing is coming up next month. The villagers in the area started the work using a Municipal Corporation of Gurgaon (MCG)-issued tender for road construction in a different area. But there is no area with the block number mentioned in the tender, DLF 3 residents alleged, adding that it was just an eyewash. The DLF 3 residents informed that the road getting concretised lies behind the Aravali Biodiversity Park and extends from a colony road in V-10 in the V-block. The MCG tender is for road construction in V-40 but, there is no V-40 in the area. “A contractor is laying concrete on the illegal road after getting a tender of Rs 40 lakh from the MCG. The contract relates to a road in V-40, but the work is ongoing in V10. It seems to be some fraud. The tender got floated in the name of V-40 because the road on V-10 is subjudice,” said Rohan Singh, a resident. The encroachers, he added, have already chopped off trees and damaged other trees by dumping waste on them. Residents said that the work is a blatant violation of the NGT norms. “How are trees being cut regularly in the area? The land is getting levelled, too, and C&D waste gets regularly dumped here. However, no action has been taken on the ground yet. We are waiting for our turn to get heard by the NGT. The case is also in the Punjab and Haryana High Court,” Sunny, a resident, said. The DLF 3 resident, who had filed a petition related to the road with the NGT in August last year, said that the MCG owns the land and must ensure that no non-forest activities get carried out there. TOI in September and January last year reported that the over 1.5km road had been built from DLF 3 into the forest area, with farmhouses, dairies and slums dotting the area and destroying the natural green cover. Villagers have been trying to capture the biodiversity park, too, the residents alleged. In a hearing on August 10, 2020, NGT chairperson Adarsh Kumar Goel had observed, “Before considering the matter further, we find it necessary to seek a factual report from a joint committee of the divisional forest officer, Gurgaon, and the MCG, within a month.” The civic body is informed about the illegal constructions in the ‘gair mumkin pahar’. On the condition of anonymity, an MCG official said, “We have asked our team to prepare a report on the issue.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/ngt-hearing-on-road-near-biodiversity-park-in-feb-but-its-being-concretised/articleshow/89231597.cms||Ipsita Pati
---||Gurgaon||Nearly 90% parents want schools to reopen, says survey||Gurgaon: Around 90% of parents in the state want to send their children to school and physical classes to resume, an online survey conducted by an association of private institutions has found. As part of their Siksha Bachao, School Kholo campaign, a group of private schools had last week rolled out the survey to assess the mood of parents regarding offline classes. Although the survey will be carried out for two more days, the association said they had so far received responses from nearly 14,000 parents and 87% of them wanted to send their kids to school.Conducted by the Federation of Private Schools’ Welfare Association, the survey had four questions for the parents — do they agree with the closure of schools, is shutting down schools logical when all other activities are operational, has the closure led to learning gaps, and whether they want to send their children back to school.The association hopes to receive responses from 20,000 parents by Tuesday. Once the survey is complete, representatives of some of the private schools will meet education minister Kanwar Pal and push for physical classes to resume.“We have launched this survey as part of the Siksha Bachao, School Kholo campaign. Not just schools, parents, too, want offline classes to resume. That is why we are conducting this survey. When both parents and schools are on the same page, we don’t see why the government is not listening to our demands?” asked Kulbhushan Sharma, president of the association.Many parents across the state have already pledged their support to the ongoing drive by the schools. “We have been garnering massive support from all quarters. Most importantly, the parents are with us. They are asking us to open the schools regardless of what the government orders say. If the government does not listen to our appeals, all schools will anyway reopen in the first week of February and parents will start sending their children,” said Ram Avtar, president of the Private Schools Welfare Association (PSWA).Some parents argued that the prolonged suspension of physical classes had also affected their kids’ social skills.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/nearly-90-parents-want-schools-to-reopen-says-survey/articleshow/89231598.cms||Siddharth Tiwari
---||Gurgaon||Set up station to track mechanised sweeping: CM||Gurgaon: Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar has directed the Municipal Corporation of Gurgaon (MCG) to tie up with the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) for setting up a monitoring station at the Sector 44 integrated command and control centre to keep track of mechanised sweeping across the city. The directive was issued after the chief minister’s surprise inspection at the MCG office on Saturday night. He had also enquired about the vehicles and employees deployed for cleanliness work.On Sunday, MCG additional commissioner Vaishali Sharma said the CM was been apprised of the operational system of mechanised sweeping in the city. “We have apprised the CM of the scheduled routes and how we are monitoring the mechanised sweeping vehicles through GPS tracker. Currently, there are 13 such vehicles plying on the roads for which seven teams of sanitation squads have already been constituted and are monitored by the supervisors. If a machine is not deployed due to maintenance or other reasons, then based on a GPS report we penalise the contracting agencies,” Sharma said. While the MCG has a control centre in Sector 39, the civic body will now set up a system at GMDA’s ICCC for monitoring the movement of mechanised sweeping vehicles on a single screen. “We will soon coordinate with the GMDA’s official on the matter and try to implement the same at the earliest,” Sharma added.The CM has also directed the GMDA to start a face recognition facility at ICCC to track suspicious persons. Referring to the farmers protest on January 31 over minimum support price (MSP), Khattar said people have a democratic right to protest and there is no problem in that. “The farmers should give their viewpoints in a democratic and in a peaceful manner,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/set-up-station-to-track-mechanised-sweeping-cm/articleshow/89231599.cms||Akanksha Gupta

The residents complained that they have been witnessing huge vehicular movement on this stretch and in the absence of traffic signals, it often leads to snarls, especially during peak hours. Besides traffic congestion, the pedestrians are also facing difficulty while crossing the road. The residents have recently written to the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) urging them to install traffic signals on around 5km long-stretch on Bajghera road at four intersections Rakesh Rana, president of Sai Kunj RWA, said, “These intersections have now become prone to accidents due to lack of traffic signals. Thousands of families are living in the area and are forced to brave the heavy traffic risking their lives. In absence of traffic signals, commuters are often found driving on the wrong side increasing the chances of accidents.” When contacted RS Tomar, DCP Traffic said, “The GMDA is going to start work on installation of traffic lights with timer and CCTV cameras covering almost the entire city, including old Gurgaon. If there is any requirement then we will carry out a survey and check the traffic movement on a trial basis.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/lack-of-signals-triggers-snarls-on-bajghera-rd-say-residents/articleshow/89231604.cms||Akanksha Gupta

---||Gurgaon||Second wetland bird count held in Haryana, 124 species spotted in Sultanpur park alone||Gurgaon: A team of wildlife officials carrying binoculars and with cameras hanging from their necks ventured into several wetlands on Sunday for a bird count. The state wetland bird census covered Sultanpur National Park and Najafgarh Jheel in Gurgaon and the Bhindawas and Mandhoti wetlands in Jhajjar. It is the second time such a census has been conducted in Haryana to assess the bird population in the state’s wetlands. The first census was in February 2020. Last year, because of the pandemic, the event was cancelled.With this count, the wildlife department also marked the World Wetlands Day that is coming up on February 2. As many as 11 teams with three members each covered Sultanpur National Park and Najafgarh Jheel. Similar teams covered the Jhajjar wetlands.After a day-long event, the teams marked their observation and made a final list of birds. “It was concluded that Sultanpur National Park has a total of 28,026 birds and 124 species,” said Rajesh Chahal, wildlife inspector, Gurgaon. Key wintering ducks include greylag geese, northern pintail, common pochard, northern shovellers, gadwall, Eurasian coot etc. The numbers for the other wetlands are not available yet. The 2020 census had recorded 214 bird species across the wetlands.On the bird count, Priyanka Chaudhary, a member, Delhi Zoo, who was at Sultanpur, said, “There are three methods to count birds. The first is called ‘point count’, where a tally of all birds detected by sight and sound by a single observer located at a fixed position during a specified period is recorded. The second is ‘line transect’, where the observer must count the birds along a line; first, five metres on the left and then again on the right of the line. The third method is counting all birds on a specific tree. It is only used when birds are less in numbers.”Some of the rare species that were spotted in Sultanpur include greater spotted eagle, red-headed falcon, imperial eagle, common kestrel, white-tailed lapwing and black-tailed godwit. The national park is also getting ready to welcome the union environment minister, Bhupender Singh Yadav, and chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on February 2. On August 10, 2021, Sultanpur National Park and Bhindawas Wildlife Sanctuary were included in the Ramsar list. Haryana has some 1,441 wetlands, but only two are protected under the Ramsar treaty. Bird expert Sanjay Sharma said that Sultanpur National Park has a good variety of wintering and resident waterfowls. After many years, there has been a successful nesting of black-necked storks at the park, too, he added. Chahal said that the survey revealed that migratory birds throng the wetland during winter, which represents a healthy sign.In February, last year, birders organised the Big Bird Day in NCR— an exercise undertaken across the country. The event was first organised on February 22, 2004, when 236 species of birds were recorded in NCR. Then in 2020, 253 bird species were spotted, higher than 247 in 2019. In 2018, 251 bird species were spotted, and in 2017, 268. In 2015 and 2016, the bird counts were 239 and 228, respectively.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/second-wetland-bird-count-held-in-haryana-124-species-spotted-in-sultanpur-park-alone/articleshow/89231606.cms||Ipsita Pati
---||---||Uttar Pradesh polls 2022: Homebuyers could tilt scales in Gurjar belt||NOIDA: Like the preceding elections, the stage is set for a Gurjar vs Gurjar contest in the Dadri constituency, home to a sizeable population of the community, in the upcoming assembly polls and unsurprisingly, most political parties have put their bet on candidates from the caste. While the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has given a ticket to its sitting MLA Tejpal Nagar, the Samajwadi Party (SP) has fielded Raj Kumar Bhati and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) Mahaveer Singh. Deepak Kumar Bhati Chotiwala, the Congress candidate, is also from the community. While both Chotiwala and Singh are first-timers, Nagar had switched to the BJP in 2012 after quitting the BSP. A former journalist, SP’s Bhati had contested twice in the past but without much success. Political analysts, however, say the demographics in the seat, which votes on February 10 for the seven-phase state assembly polls, have seen a sea-change over the last five years with a large number of new homebuyers shifting into the high rise apartments each year. There are about one lakh voters in nearly 77 high rises in the constituency. About two lakh of the over six lakh total voters, meanwhile, belong to the Gurjar community. BSP chief Mayawati’s paternal village Badalpur, which also falls in this constituency, has a significant Jatav and Scheduled Caste (SC) vote bank. According to Dr Bhawna Sharma, assistant professor (political science) at Amity University, Dadri continues to be largely a rural constituency with caste politics holding a predominant sway. “As Dadri has a sizeable chunk of voters from the Gurjar community, for political parties it is, and has been, a deciding factor while picking a candidate. Also, unlike urban areas, where people generally take individual decisions, in villages people cast bulk votes to a single party or a candidate,” Sharma said. However, in the season of digital campaigning, which has gained significant ground amid the pandemic, she added, these urban homebuyers could tilt the scales. Considered a BSP bastion until 2017, the party’s Satveer Singh Gurjar had won two consecutive elections in 2007 and 2012. Riding on the support of the homebuyers, BJP’s Tejpal Nagar, however, managed to outmuscle Gurjar in 2017. But five years later, apartment owners are disgruntled with the local legislator as they continue to grapple with the delayed registry of flats, poor infrastructure, arbitrary charges imposed by builders and lack of public transport among others. While Nagar has assured to take up the issues as a priority in his next tenure, Noida Extension Flat Owners Welfare Association (NEFOWA) president Abhishek Kumar told TOI that they were seeking affidavits from all candidates about promises being made by them. “So far, we have received it from Chotiwala (the Congress candidate), however, have not decided who to vote for in the upcoming elections.” Chotiwala, too, told TOI that the party was dedicated to the cause of the homebuyers. The BSP and SP are also not far behind. “The authority that has allotted lands to builders after taking 20-30% of the amount is not registering the flats in the names of buyers who have paid all their dues. The authority says that builders are yet to clear their dues. Why home buyers are made to suffer on the account of someone else’s fault? We will not tolerate this,” BSP’s Manveer Singh said. Job quotaReservation of jobs in local industries for local youths has also emerged as another major poll issue. Attacking the current dispensation, Singh said that despite having an industrial authority and several factories in Dadri, local youths were unable to get jobs. “Our youths have become unemployed after their lands were acquired by the government. They are now shooed away and insulted by factory owners. This is our land but people living 200-km away are getting jobs here. Our agenda is to get 50% reservations in local industries,” Singh said, adding that they were also committed to the cause of farmers. Chotiwala, meanwhile, claimed that the foundation for destroying the future of local youth was laid since the time of the BSP, which continued to be ignored during the subsequent SP and the BJP governments. “None of them has done anything for the youths. This time we are asking voters to give us a chance. We have major plans for the development of the constituency which lacks public transport, government hospitals, schools or colleges,” he said. Nagar, however, has trounced the opposition’s acquisitions as “lies”. “Forty per cent reservation to local youths has already been granted and we have been working towards resolving several issues related to the farmers,” he said. Mihir Bhoj rowNot just sullen apartment dwellers, the BJP may also have to face the brunt of the controversy over the plaque of ninth-century Samrat Mihir Bhoj, a prominent Gurjar king. In October 2021, Nagar had invited chief minister Yogi Adityanath to inaugurate a statue of Bhoj at a Dadri college claiming him to be a Gurjar leader, however, it had triggered an outrage among the Rajputs, which also has a significant vote bank in the area, and the word Gurjar was allegedly removed from the statue on the day of the event but later restored. Nagar had faced severe protests from his own community over the issue and the BJP was also seen on the back foot. Interestingly, Union home minister Amit Shah also chose Dadri over the two other GB Nagar constituencies to canvass for the state polls on January 27. While canvassing for Nagar, Shah also met with members of the Jatav community and pitched the upcoming elections as a mandate “for the future of Uttar Pradesh for the next 20 years, rather than just picking the next MLA or CM.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/homebuyers-could-tilt-scales-in-gurjar-belt/articleshow/89235622.cms||Aditya Dev

He was in Ghaziabad on Sunday to campaign for the party’s candidates in Loni and Sahibabad.Owaisi said that his party would emerge as an alternative in the assembly elections as “Muslims are not mere vote banks now”. In Sahibabad, Owaisi addressed a public gathering. In Loni, however, he held a virtual meeting with party supporters .The AIMIM chief also accused SP and BSP of “silently” supporting the objectionable comments made against the minority community in Dharam Sansads in Haridwar, Raipur and Prayagraj.“In a Dharam Sansad in Prayagraj, demands were made to close down the Darul Uloom Deoband and madrasas in Bareilly. People present there used atrocious language. Will action not be taken against any of them? Why does the Prime Minister, chief minister, SP and BSP not say anything? The SP and BSP and RLD leaders have not spoken against them. Is this cowardice or their agreement to this issue?” he asked during the virtual meet.While paying a tribute to Mahatma Gandhi on his 74th death anniversary on Sunday, Owaisi said there were still many people who had “Gandhi on the lips and (Nathuram) Godse in the heart”.In Shaheed Nagar of Sahibabad, the AIMIM president conducted a door-to-door campaign for party candidate Pandit Manmohan Jha. He again targeted BJP over the Lakhimpur Kheri incident, asking why no action was taken against Union minister of state Ajay Mishra Teni, whose son is accused of running over a group of farmers. Owaisi added that his party was fighting for equality and the welfare of the suppressed. “SP has cut the tickets of 45% of Muslim candidates. Muslims are not mere vote banks now,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ghaziabad/sp-bsp-silently-backing-dharam-sansad-remarks-owaisi-says-in-gzb/articleshow/89231610.cms||Aditya Dev

---||Noida||Remove squatters in 2 wks, Noida told||Noida: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has given the Noida Authority two weeks’ time to clear encroachments on around five acres of green belts and parks in Sector 48.The NGT had in 2018 asked the Authority to clear encroachments in the area. A group of residents, however, moved the green panel again on January 5 this year, alleging that the Authority had taken no concrete steps in keeping with the earlier directive. On January 21, the green tribunal gave the Authority two weeks to clear the encroachments.The encroachments, the residents said, were mainly from local traders in the Barola market who had built godowns to store construction material such as marbles, stone chips, iron rods, concrete slabs, etc. Apart from a couple of parks and green areas, over 150 plots had also been occupied illegally, they alleged.“We have been raising complaints regarding encroachments for several years now. It is mainly in the form of godowns to store construction material. It is also leading to unauthorised groundwater extraction from borewells. Despite repeated complaints to the Noida Authority, there has been no concrete action,” said Pawan Goel, the RWA president of blocks B, C and D of Sector 48.He added that trucks carrying construction material were also causing disruptions in the green area. It was on August 14, 2018, that the NGT had asked the Authority to restore the green area. The residents claimed that the Authority only took partial action. “It was a mere eyewash. No concrete step was taken despite repeated appeals,” Goel said.Subsequently, on January 5 this year, the residents again moved the NGT, seeking compliance of its 2018 directive. “The NGT ruled in favour of the residents again by asking the Noida Authority to clear the area in two weeks,” Goel said.Asked about the NGT order, a senior Authority official said, “The file on encroachment in Sector 48 has been sent to the land department for verification. We need to ascertain if the land comes under the notified area of the Authority. Suitable action will be taken after that.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/remove-squatters-in-2-wks-noida-told/articleshow/89231614.cms||Meenakshi Sinha

The drive will continue across different sectors in the coming days. “We started the RT-PCR and antigen tests on Friday and held the camp across two sectors – 93 and 122, that day. On Saturday, they were held in sectors 39 and 82. We plan to conduct tests across two sectors per day. Just two days of the drive have been completed and approximately 60-70 people opted to get themselves tested on an average from these sectors,” said KK Jain, secretary general FONRWA. “We will start vaccination camps across four sectors from today. These include sectors 50, 61, 34 and 23. While the camps will be held in the community centres of these sectors, the Residents Welfare Associations of these sectors are the contact persons for all the coordination related matters. They have been directed to make necessary arrangements and inform residents of the camps in their sectors,” he added. The vaccination camp will provide the first dose of the vaccine to children between 15 and 17, the second dose will be provided to everyone who is eligible for it, while precautionary boosters will be given to residents who are 60 years and above.

---||Mumbai||MVA future of politics in Maharashtra, no scope of a reunion with BJP: Sanjay Raut||Mumbai: Slamming Prime Minister Narendra Modi for turning India’s politics into an event, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Sunday said that the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) was the future of politics in Maharashtra and there was no room for the Sena re-uniting with the BJP again. In his weekly column Rok Thok in Saamna, Raut said that there was no truth in the speculation that there was “an under-the-table deal between the BJP and the Sena” for a possible reunion. Referring to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s speech on January 23, where Thackeray had said that the Sena had rotted for 25 years in the alliance with the BJP, Raut said, “The message from his speech was that the MVA, which comprises of the Shiv Sena, NCP and the Congress, is the political future of Maharashtra, and there is no truth in speculation of any kind of deal taking place between the Sena and the BJP that they could get back together,” Raut wrote. “Thackeray’s speech and BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis’s response to it have made the state’s politics clear, and there is no room for confusion. There is no possibility of a Shiv Sena-BJP reunion after Fadnavis’s response. The MVA is here to stay. The BJP will have to spend next many years around the Raj Bhavan,” said Raut while taking a jibe at the BJP that has approached the Maharashtra Governor to complain against the MVA government over several issues in the last two years. Responding to Thackeray’s speech, Fadnavis had said that the “Sena had, in fact, grown politically due to its alliance with the BJP. “Recent rural local body poll results in Maharashtra should act as a guideline to both the ruling MVA and the opposition BJP. The BJP did get more seats, but the MVA parties collectively edged ahead of the BJP. This shows that whenever the state assembly elections are held, the MVA’s majority of 170 seats (out of a total of 288 seats) will continue to stay. This is the mindset of Maharashtra,” Raut said. Raut claimed there was a ‘wall of businessmen’ around the Prime Minister. “Modi has transformed Indian politics into an event, and given it a festive character. No one in the world has done this,” Raut said, hitting out at the PM. On the occasion of Mahatma Gandhi’s death anniversary on Sunday, Raut said the formation of Pakistan was Jinnah’s demand. “If there was a real ‘Hindutva Wadi’, then he/she would’ve shot Jinnah, not Gandhi. Such an act would’ve been an act of patriotism. The world even today mourns Gandhiji’s death,” said Raut.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mva-future-of-politics-in-maha-no-scope-of-a-reunion-with-bjp/articleshow/89231618.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

TAS has clubbed together the Finnish model with the Centre's National Education Policy (NEP), 2020.Plans are afoot to open branches in Thane and Navi Mumbai as well. The Mumbai TAS will be flagged off “very soon,” he added. TAS launched the NEP model on Republic Day with the kindergarten students presenting their own versions of popular stories such as the ‘Thirsty Crow’ and ‘Bella, Bear and Birds’.With the emphasis on creativity, communication and curiosity, and, of course the time-honoured class room, TAS is keen on blending traditional curriculum with growth of the physical, cognitive, socio-emotional and creative aspects of a child's personality, said Maithili Tambe, a medico-turned-academician, and TAS CEO.Stating that TAS' experiment is in keeping with the guidelines of NEP, Tambe said, “The NEP has a wide ambit from early childhood to higher education, both professional and vocational, teacher training, and a proper focus on applied learning, multiple learning pathways and technology-enabled pedagogy.”Taking a cue from the much-praised Finnish education model, TAS got going with a slew of campaigns to underscore academic excellence, problem-solving and social skills, and character-development of young students.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/school-modelled-on-finnish-method-of-edu-nep-to-come-up-soon/articleshow/89231620.cms||---

In a letter to Union environment minister Bhupendra Yadav, who heads the CZA, the BJP has asked the authority to hold back approvals given to the zoo till an inquiry is conducted. The CZA is the nodal agency that regulates zoos in India. “If rigged tenders are awarded and this results in substandard work, then the life of animals will be threatened and they will be at risk. Therefore I urge you to initiate an inquiry into this and seek a detailed report from the BMC. Till a report from BMC is awaited, NOCs and approvals given should be suspended or revoked. I urge you to send a team of CZA experts to Byculla zoo to inspect the quality of all existing animal enclosures, especially the penguin exhibits, and re-examine all the plans submitted for the new animal enclosures,” BJP corporator Vinod Mishra wrote to Yadav.. The BJP has already made several complaints to the civic body and even filed a complaint with the Mumbai Police’s Economic Offences Wing (EOW). Following this the EOW wrote to the anti-corruption bureau (ACB), asking them to carry out an inquiry. The BMC had recently floated two tenders to construct animal enclosures and exhibits. While the tenders were estimated at Rs 91 crore and Rs 94 crore, the two companies Ms Highway Construction Company and Ms Skyway Infraproejcts bid Rs 146 crore and Rs 145 crore respectively. This resulted in cost escalation of Rs 106 crore.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/bjp-seeks-cza-probe-into-zoos-rigged-tenders/articleshow/89231623.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Mumbai||Gangster’s threat call to ex-CP’s friend a hoax: CID||Mumbai: The alleged threat call by gangster Chhota Shakeel to Sanjay Punamia — close friend of former police commissioner Param Bir Singh — appears to be a hoax, as per the investigations of the state Crime Intelligence Department (CID). The CID has found that the audio was manipulated in order to match the gangster’s voice. On the radar of the investigating agency is a cyber expert, who is also a key witness in the Antilia bomb scare case, and the murder of Mansukh Hiran. The agency has recorded his statement several times in connection with the alleged underworld threat call. CID suspects that the cyber expert helped the accused fabricate false evidence. The case pertains to a complaint lodged by Punamia in February 2021, when Singh was commissioner of police, stating that the gangster had issued threats on behalf of real estate developer Shyam Agarwal to settle their property dispute. Singh transferred the case to the crime branch and invoked the stringent MCOCA against Agarwal, though no one was arrested. Agarwal later accused police officers of threatening him and demanding Rs 50 lakh on behalf of Singh. “We have gone through the two recorded audio tapes where the gangster allegedly threatens Punamia on behalf of Agarwal and asks him to settle. Both the audio tapes have not matched with Shakeel’s voice samples which we had collected from Mumbai Police records,’’ said an officer. Cops have ruled out the call was from Pakistan, where gangster Shakeel is believed to reside.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/gangsters-threat-call-to-ex-cps-friend-a-hoax-cid/articleshow/89231624.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut’s daughters operate wine distribution company, says BJP leader Kirit Somaiya||MUMBAI: The BJP and the MVA partners continue to spar over the government decision to allow the sale of wine in supermarkets. On Sunday, BJP leader Kirit Somaiya targeted Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut and alleged that his family members had entered into a partnership with a company called Magpie DFS Pvt Ltd, which was involved in distribution of wine, a few months ago. “Raut’s two daughters are directors in the company. The main business of the company was also changed to trading of wine after Raut’s family members entered into a partnership with the company. With such deep financial interests in these businesses, no wonder the MVA partners see no wrong in the decision which aims to make Maharashtra into Madya Rashtra (liquor state),” said Somaiya. Amruta, wife of former CM Devendra Fadnavis, also criticised the government decision in a tweet. NCP leader Nawab Malik asked whether the BJP will shut distilleries and wineries owned by its members. “There are several leaders in the BJP who cannot sleep without drinking. People using words like drunkards, we all know where they sit in the night and what they have,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/rauts-daughters-operate-wine-distribution-co-bjp/articleshow/89231626.cms||---

The accused, Rohit Gupta, even went to the girl’s house and made obscene gestures in a bid to outrage her modesty. This is the second time the LT Marg police have arrested Gupta for stalking and outraging the modesty of the same victim. Gupta was earlier arrested in March 2021 for the same offence. The 20-year-old complainant lodged a case against Gupta on Saturday, allegeing that he had started stalking her again. In her complaint to the police, she said Gupta was stalking her on Instagram, and when she blocked him, he opened a new account and started sending her messages. She said that on Saturday, while she was out for some work, the accused came to her house but her mother answered the door and asked him to go away. The accused, however, waited for the woman to return. “When the complainant returned, he allegedly made an obscene gesture outraging her modesty and fled away,” said a police officer. The woman came in contact with Gupta while she and her sister were looking for a job online. The accused got friendly under the pretext of helping them get one. — Ahmed Ali||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/man-held-for-again-stalking-woman-he-had-harassed-last-yr/articleshow/89231627.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Teen spirit, boosters fail to lift demand for paid doses||MUMBAI: Paid vaccination failed to see any uptick in demand despite the inclusion of teenagers in the national drive and initiation of boosters for essential workers and senior citizens since January. Data shows that up to 93% vaccination in the city took place at the public centres. With free centres having abundant stocks, many private centres across the state have stopped procuring vaccines and holding drives altogether.  According to civic data, nearly 14 lakh vaccine doses were administered in the city this month, of which 12.61 lakh were given at the public centres. The private hospitals administered a little over a lakh doses, including the booster shots delivered to their own staffers. Several private centres sitting on a pile of unsold inventory were hoping that the teenage as well as the booster leg will help them exhaust their stocks. It didn’t happen though, and private centres, in fact, administered fewer doses in January (1.04lakh) compared to December (1.45lakh). “Paid vaccination demand is almost over. We didn’t see any increase in demand even with the expansion of the drive to new population groups in January,” said Dr Sunil Agrawal of Malad-based Sanjeevani Hospital. “Those who are left with vaccines are trying to sell them before expiry. Nobody in the private sector is buying at present,” he said, adding that he had unsold stocks of nearly 3,000 doses.  Dr Prince Surana, CEO of Surana Group, said that at each of his three hospitals, the daily footfall for vaccination is not more than 50-60 per day. “We were planning to tie-up with a school to vaccinate their students, but the BMC said they would do it for free since they had the doses,” he said, adding that the demand for paid vaccination is unlikely to see a surge like last year.  The cost of Covaxin, Rs 2,500 for two doses, is prohibitive for most families. “If a family has two children, it goes up to Rs 5,000. Why would parents come to a paid centre then,” said a hospital head, adding that they have nearly 2,000 doses. “There are hardly 6-8 people coming in daily, so we are sceptical to open vials on some days,” he said. Dr Sachin Desai, state’s immunisation officer, said 95% of vaccination across the state is in public centres.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/teen-spirit-boosters-fail-to-lift-demand-for-paid-doses/articleshow/89231629.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The driver, Raju Karwade (35), was waiting for passengers on the east side of Vasai Road railway station around 6.30am on Saturday. The minor, who had boarded a train from Delhi and alighted at Vasai, approached him and asked if he could help her find a place to stay. Karwade’s suspicions were raised due to the girl’s apparent young age. When he questioned her, she was honest about having run away from home on Friday. She showed him her Aadhaar card, which stated she was 14 years old. Karwade telephoned traffic cop Rakesh Lohakare, who asked him to bring the teenager to the Manickpur police station. On-duty cop Vikas Takwale offered the girl breakfast and began to question her. The Aadhaar card helped the cops contact their counterparts at Saket police station in Delhi, where a kidnapping case had been filed on Friday by the parents. The girl’s parents reached Manickpur police station late on Saturday. The mother said the teen was spending hours on the phone talking to friends. When the mother told her to focus on her studies, the girl left her Pushpvihar home in a fit of anger. Senior inspector Bhausaheb Aher said Karwade’s alertness helped reunite her with her family.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/auto-driver-reunites-teen-girl-with-delhi-kin/articleshow/89231630.cms||Sandhya Nair
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra education board seeks vax data on Std 10 & 12 students||MUMBAI: Vaccination of Std 12 and 10 students is likely to pick up with the state education board seeking details of how many have been vaccinated across schools and junior colleges. With written exams for HSC and SSC to begin from March, the state education board has asked schools and junior colleges to speed up vaccination of students. The inoculation of citizens in the 15-17 years category began from January 3 but is yet to pick up. Though there is no directive against allowing unvaccinated students from appearing for the board exams, the state wants maximum students to be vaccinated before exams begin. As the two doses of Covaxin can be administered four to six weeks apart, students can be fully vaccinated before exams begin. “We will be vaccinating our Std 10 students on Monday. Hopefully, they will be fully vaccinated by the time they write their papers in mid-March,” said the principal of a school in Kandivli. Junior colleges, especially, have been told to pick up the pace on vaccination of students who will write their exams from March 3. “HSC students should try and get fully vaccinated by February end,” said an education officer. HSC students will start heading to colleges for their board practicals and orals from February 14. Colleges have been told to follow all Covid protocols when students are on the campus. Details of vaccinated students have to be shared with the state education board soon. The BMC’s health department has begun approaching schools and colleges for vaccinating students. Vivek College in Goregaon recently vaccinated 822 eligible students. St Arnold’s high school and junior college in Andheri (east) launched its vaccination drive on Friday and expects to get all its eligible students vaccinated.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/state-edu-board-seeks-vax-data-on-std-10-12-students/articleshow/89231632.cms||Sandhya Nair

The woman told the police that the duo would stare at her, stalk her inside the pub and make inappropriate comments. The duo was booked on charges of molestation under IPC section 354. The woman said the harassment began on January 22. The prime accused visited the pub alone at first. He would stare at her and follow her every where, even to the washroom. At one point, he asked for her phone number and invited her to “come and party with him.” The woman categorically refused. The accused returned to harass her on January 27 and then on 28. This time, he was accompanied by a friend. Both men would stalk her and pass comments; one of them even whistled at her. Fed up, the woman approached the Khar police after which both the accused — Ganesh Bisht (39) and Harish Kanwar (25) were arrested. Bisht works as a chef in an adjacent restaurant.

Ron Gordon, a retired teacher of mathematics from California in the US, has invited Indians to join him in celebrating a fun new day this Wednesday. February 2, 2022, reads 2/2/22, which is designated as Trumpet Day given its sound effect—too, too, too-too! “No one needs a trumpet to celebrate the day. Just two lips and vocal cords to be able to sing out ‘to to to toooo!’,” he laughed. “Trumpet Days are rare,” Gordon said. “We have only two true Trumpet Days in a century, 2/22/2 and 2/2/22. Two others merit recognition: 2/2/2 is but a toot short, and the upcoming February 22, 2022, or 2/22/22 is a little too(t) long.” Louiz Banks, an accomplished trumpeter who later took to the piano, laughed in amusement when TOI informed him about the phonetic link. “I love the association that is being made between 2/2/22 and the musical instrument. The sound is indeed very close to the trumpet, so it is appropriate in a funny way! I wish this was made an annual celebration, then people would dedicate February 2 in honour of the trumpet. It is such a beautiful instrument,” Banks said. His favourite song on it is ‘Besame Mucho’. Gordon has devised a Trumpet Day contest on his website—www.trumpetday.net—which features their largest prize ever, $2,222. Contest entries must be submitted within 2+2+22 days of Trumpet Day — from January 20 through February 15. Always on the lookout for curious date connections, Gordon had earlier initiated Square Root Day on April 4, 2016, which reads 4/4/16. He had designated it so because four is the square root of 16.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/on-2/2/22-toot-the-date-trumpet-the-sound/articleshow/89231637.cms||Bella Jaisinghani

Latest statistics shared on Sunday showed that the highest reported month in 2021 was May, when 780 people were fined for not wearing masks; the numbers dropped to 197 cases in December. But in January this year, the cases have risen drastically. As many as 2,043 (up 937%) commuters have been fined over Rs 4 lakh. “We have witnessed a huge rise in the number of cases booked daily in January. In fact, on nine different days in January, we had caught at least 100 passengers daily for not wearing masks,” said CR chief spokesperson Shivaji Sutar. A Western Railway official said it reported 844 cases of people not wearing masks on the suburban section in January and the cumulative fine imposed was nearly a lakh. This financial year (2021-22), over 15,000 cases of commuters violating norms were registered on the Western Railway, and Rs 22 lakh in fines were collected. On CR Main and Harbour suburban sections, close to 5,000 commuters were caught and Rs 10 lakh fines were recovered, said sources.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/no-of-people-sans-mask-on-cr-rises-over-900-in-a-mth/articleshow/89231643.cms||Somit Sen

There was confusion after MoS for education Bacchu Kadu directed education officers to postpone board exams by a month and hold them in April. He had also suggested reducing the weightage of written exams. However, Gaikwad said: “Any change in decision has an impact on many other things like supplementary exams, admissions in Std 11. Students have lost out on education in the last two years of the pandemic, and we want to ensure that the next academic year starts as per schedule.” She added that the government is talking to experts to see how exams can be held offline with maximum safety to the students. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/ssc-hsc-exams-to-be-conducted-as-per-schedule-offline-edu-min/articleshow/89231644.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Govt may set up fund to support R&D, innovation||Mumbai: There is renewed hope of an innovation and R&D fund being finally announced in the Budget this year — a move which will benefit a cross-section of Indian industry, including pharma, IT and manufacturing. The coronavirus pandemic has stressed the need for innovation more than ever before. Over the last few months, there have been discussions between the department of pharma and industry bodies over R&D incentives, with the government readying a draft on the issue. There is speculation about a targeted fund for strengthening knowledge-driven sectors like pharma & IT, and restoring tax benefits on R&D undertaken by companies, being in the works, industry experts told TOI. Over the years, there has been talk about an R&D fund being announced for innovation-driven sectors including pharmaceuticals, but it didn’t see the light of day. The draft R&D policy finalised by the government highlights funding for innovation for pharma and medtech, strengthening the R&D infrastructure (creation of innovation hubs like Singapore, Boston & San Francisco), and industry-academic collaboration. “India, being the pharmacy of the developing world, needs to move up the value chain. Innovation should be supported as this is going to be fundamental for the healthcare industry,” Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance’s secretary general Sudarshan Jain said. Besides restoring weighted average tax deduction of 200% on R&D spends, companies setting up innovation hubs should get tax sops, an industry executive said. Tech driven-innovative healthcare solutions have played a pivotal role in fighting the Covid crisis. This year’s Budget should focus on encouraging these solutions by way of tax benefit/ tax holidays and even establishing a healthcare innovation fund, according to Alok Roy, chair of Ficci Health Services Committee and chairman of Medica Group of Hospitals. The pandemic has also necessitated the need for a more self-reliant India. The government should protect the domestic manufacturing base by increasing customs duty on import of medical devices to at least 15% from existing 0-7.5%. Due to low custom duty, India is importing Rs 46,000-crore medical devices, and is over 80% import-dependent, Association of Indian Medical Device Industry’s forum coordinator Rajiv Nath said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/govt-may-set-up-fund-to-support-rd-innovation/articleshow/89231646.cms||Rupali Mukherjee
---||Mumbai||Legal experts split over crypto regulation||Mumbai: Legal experts are divided over regulating crypto assets. While one section is advising the government not to take a hasty decision without understanding the use cases, the other is against continuing the status quo despite the difficulty in defining crypto.ICICI Bank’s group general counsel Pramod Rao has said, “The government’s pause (on introducing the crypto bill in Parliament) is a good thing for us to wait and watch, and decide whether we need a separate regulator, which can transcend into all use cases.”However, Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas partner Anu Tiwari said that it will take a few years for a new regulator to attain maturity — which is too long a time for crypto. According to Tiwari, Sebi is the practical choice for regulating crypto despite challenges like identifying issuers of tokens.The legal experts were speaking in a webinar organised by Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy on Saturday.According to Rao, regulation is aimed at having transparent rules that are commonly applied. One cannot expect regulation to be a safety net for investors. Rao said it is incumbent on the domestic crypto industry to keep enhancing the level of disclosures. Rao also said that in the case of regulation, the application of several existing laws will have to be considered. “Crypto trading may already be contravening the exchange control norms under FEMA (Foreign Exchange Management Act),” he said.Sriram Chakravarthi, partner at Singapore-based law firm Rajah & Tann, too said the status quo cannot continue. “It is better to have a process of constant evolution, consultation and then come up with guidelines, etc, and looking at how they work rather than the wait-and-watch approach,” said.Rao said that Sebi was more aligned to regulate the category of stablecoins — cryptocurrencies linked to an underlying asset like gold or dollar. Crypto is generated by automated algorithms. “Is the developer — the algorithm’s creator — the one you want to hold responsible? What if they are not situated in India?” Rao asked.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/legal-experts-split-over-crypto-regulation/articleshow/89231647.cms||Aseem Gujar
---||Mumbai||MF body asks fund houses to freeze foreign investments||Mumbai: The Association of Mutual Funds in India (Amfi) on Sunday asked all fund houses to stop any incremental investments abroad, effective February 2. The move came after Indian fund houses together reached the Sebi-imposed $7-billion overall limit for such investments. Some of the fund houses have already restricted inflows into schemes that invest abroad. Industry players, however, said that there are enough indications that the issue would soon be resolved, unless the RBI is unwilling to let Indians invest abroad through this route.According to A Balasubramanian, chairman of the MF industry trade body Amfi, it is understood that the government has increased this limit to $15 billion. This may get notified soon, both by the government and the RBI. “Once it is notified, it will be business as usual. Hence, one has to wait for clarity on this issue,” Balasubramanian, who’s also the MD & CEO of Aditya Birla MF, said. According to an industry source, last week Sebi inspected the total investment positions of MFs in overseas assets and found that the limit was fully utilised. Subsequently, it asked fund houses to restrict incremental investments abroad, which led to the Amfi directive. The $7-billion limit was set in June 2021 with the individual fund house limit set at $1 billion.Sources further said that the government has already proposed to more than double the $7-billion limit to $15 billion, but the enhancement would be spaced out over a few years. The enhanced limit will be applicable only after the RBI issues a circular. “Sebi officials felt till such a circular is issued, fund houses should not make any incremental investments abroad,” the source said. A statement from the government could also come during the finance minister’s Budget speech on Tuesday, the source said.Balasubramanian, however, clarified that the current situation was not a big challenge and he’s hopeful it would be resolved soon. Indian fund houses have been investing abroad for over a decade. The trend, however, has gathered pace in the last couple of years after fund houses started launching exchange-traded funds and feeder funds to invest in schemes that are sold and managed abroad.Another perceptible trend is existing equity schemes investing part of their corpus abroad. Although Sebi had allowed fund houses to invest up to 15% of their total corpus abroad about a decade ago, for several years there were only a handful of schemes that utilised this limit. A large number of Indian fund managers, however, have taken this route only in the last three years. These two factors together have led Indian fund houses to close in on the Sebi imposed $7-billion limit to invest abroad.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mf-body-asks-fund-houses-to-freeze-foreign-investments/articleshow/89231648.cms||---

He will bring the six rail assets (a portfolio of 690km in terms of track length, see graphic) under Adani Tracks Management Services — a 100% arm of the listed Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone. The consolidation will allow Adani, who is targeting to have a portfolio of 2,000km of track length by 2025, to participate in public-private partnership projects of the Indian Railways “without having to compete with similar businesses in the Adani portfolio”, the group said.According to the country’s rail plan 2020, the Indian Railways will invest more than Rs 3 lakh crore over 10 years to construct new rail lines. Further, the government’s shift in focus from road to rail as the preferred mode of transport, an obvious choice both economically and environmentally, will require significant participation from private sector. Adani has built the rail portfolio mainly through public-private partnerships and acquisitions. He bought 20% in Kutch Railway (the government holds the rest), covering 301km (the longest rail track in his portfolio) and acquired the Krishnapatnam Rail Company, covering a track length of 113km. He gained equity interest (about 13%) in the latter following the acquisition of Krishnapatnam Port in Andhra Pradesh (the second-largest private sector port in the country). The balance (87%) in Krishnapatnam Rail is held by the government. Consolidating the rail transportation businesses will help the business tycoon to channelise investments to this specific entity as against multiple entities that have a play in the same segment. It will also help Adani to tap opportunities in adjacent areas like participating in the General Purpose Wagon Investment Scheme (GPWIS) of the Indian Railways. This scheme allows the private sector to invest in wagons and rakes to transfer certain commodities like coal, iron ore and minerals. Until four years ago, the transportation of these commodities were controlled by the Indian Railways.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/adani-to-merge-rail-ops-in-single-co/articleshow/89231649.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Secunderabad: Army headquarters seeks input on Cantonment civil area removal||SECUNDERABAD: In a move that could eventually see civilian areas of Secunderabad Cantonment getting merged with Hyderabad, the ministry of defence (MoD) has sought inputs from the local military authority (LMA) in a key document related to the excision of civilian areas from 62 Cantonments across the country. According to the letter in possession with TOI, the MoD has prepared draft modalities and mechanisms on the excision of civil areas of Cantonments and has asked the LMA to incorporate inputs and comments within a week and send it back to the army headquarters. Officials at the Telangana Andhra Sub Area headquarters are dealing with the document. Sources said the Army may come up with a comprehensive policy on the excision of civil areas soon. Defence sources are however tight-lipped on likely recommendation by the LMA to Army HQ on the issue. "It is highly confidential and we can't reveal the content. Our reply will be comprehensive," said a defence source. It is, however, learnt that Cantonments across the country have to be converted into ‘military stations' after de-notification of civil areas from them. "As the matter is being dealt directly by the Army HQ, the role of the chief executive officers (CEOs) of all Cantonment boards has also been minimised in excision of civil areas of the Cantonments," one source said. Residents of Secunderabad have been demanding the merger of civil areas of the Cantonment with the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation, mainly over poor facilities. Over four lakh SCB residents also supported a campaign led by TOI where senior government officials, SCB board top officials and civil society brainstormed on the need to merge several SCB colonies with GHMC. On August 6, 2018, the minister of state (MoS) for defence Subhash Bhamre set the ball rolling in the Rajya Sabha saying the Army has suggested excision of civil areas of cantonments and converting military pockets into military stations. Thereafter the Prime Minister's Office and Army HQ, Delhi, got involved in preparation of draft and modalities to the proposal of de-notification of civil areas. The first meeting on de-notification was held in November 2021 under the chairmanship of Union defence minister Rajnath Singh. The MoD took terms and conditions of excision of civil areas of Ambala Cantonment, based on the MoD policy of excision in 1955 and prepared a draft on possible excision. Jitender Surana, general secretary, All Cantonments Citizen's Welfare Association (ACCWA), said several civilian areas in the cantonments across the country would benefit from the merger for good governance. "Of course, it's a lengthy process and once MoD gives the nod, the process of de-notification of civil areas of the Cantonment will be done," added Surana. Sources said that the government may complete the process before the 2024 general elections.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/army-hq-seeks-input-on-cantt-civil-area-removal/articleshow/89231651.cms||Sunil Mungara

Avtar is a diversity consulting firm. The report says companies also are advancing the gender diversity ratios in the workplace through a combination of career development, male allyship, and second career programmes. “We would be adding 2 crore women to the workforce in a short span of five years as organisations have started hiring in big numbers. It’s definitely a cause for cheer,” said Avtar founder Saundarya Rajesh. She said between 2015 and 2020, the enrolment of female students in higher education courses has seen growth of 18.2%. This will fire up the entry-level talent pipeline. Consulting, IT/ITeS and BFSI will be the top three industries hiring women talent this year, the report said. Pharma is expected to register a 7 percentage point increase in women hires to 35% this year, from 28% five years ago. Some of the structural and cultural changes have aided the increased participation of women. The pandemic has disrupted the linear approach to working from a physical location to supporting hybrid and remote work models. Avtar’s report shows that 3.8 lakh companies are expected to offer remote work this year, almost double that in 2016. “India is looking at attracting higher FDI and creating a lot more unicorns this year. Jobseekers ghosted companies in a hot talent market. Increased employable women in the workforce is a formidable force to create value and improve the diversity balance,” Rajesh said. Around 12 lakh urban women are expected to benefit from the shift to remote work. Upskilling has become a key priority at 3.9 lakh companies, compared to 1.7 lakh in 2016. The number of firms offering male allies at the workplace not just for personal growth but also for creating an inclusive culture and challenging stereotypes at the workplace has also risen markedly. The number of firms offering child care support to both men and women will increase to 581 this year, from 165 in 2016. "Post-Covid, a larger number of organisations have internalised the need for better child-care. Near home and near-office creches, as well as on-premise creches will increase. Care-giver policies (to enable women to engage in-house care givers) will also increase. This will enable 19 lakh women to benefit,” Rajesh said. About 481 firms are offering second careers (those returning after a break) this year, compared to 191 in 2016. This year, it is expected to benefit over 27 lakh women.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/employable-women-jobseekers-rise-by-2-crore-in-5-years-report/articleshow/89231657.cms||Shilpa Phadnis

The team has alleged the mob has allegiance to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and Bajrang Dal. Four people have been arrested, including Sanju Nalvade, who is a member of Bajrang Dal. According to the Bahutva Karnataka team, incidents targeting Muslim students and residents have been on the rise since mid-2021. In its findings, it has detailed the case of Zayed, 17 — a Siddheswar Government College student and the only Muslim in his class — who was taken out of his classroom by a mob of around 100-150 people and thrashed publicly. The mob was allegedly made up of members of a particular student union. They also brutalised Zayed’s uncle when he came to his rescue. In the first week of January 2022, a riot was on the verge of breaking out between 200 men belonging to various right-wing organisations and 40 Muslims, in Lodigalli area of Naragund. As per the findings, police arrived and arrested four from the Muslim community and filed an FIR on allegedly ‘fabricated’ grounds of defaming Hindu gods. Those arrested in Sameer Shahpur’s murder were also involved in these communal incidents as per the fact-finding report.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/fair-probe-sought-into-gadag-killing/articleshow/89231662.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Killer trucks claimed at least 15 lives in Bengaluru in January||BENGALURU: On January 13, a six-year-old reality show participant, Samanvi R, was crushed to death by a rashly driven tipper truck near Konanakunte Cross. This was one of the seven fatal road accidents involving such vehicles in Bengaluru in January so far, claiming at least 15 lives. The victims include a 20-year-old girl who died near Hebbal on January 21 (her birthday) when a speeding truck ran over her after she fell down from the bike she was riding pillion. Even earth-moving machines seen all over the city owing to unending construction work are contributing to fatal accidents. On January 1, a three-year-old boy, the only child of two construction labourers, was crushed to death near Majestic. The accident happened when he came out of his makeshift shed looking for his parents. During Samanvi’s cremation, a family friend had expressed shock over the way in which some trucks and tippers are driven on busy roads. “Trucks and tippers take sudden turns, go rashly between vehicles, and enter wrong directions. And, earth-moving machines are seen parked in threatening ways,” he had said. Police records show heavy vehicles, including trucks, killed 57 victims in 2019, while the number fell to 31 in 2020, the year that witnessed a series of lockdowns because of the pandemic. In 2021, there were 35 deaths. When it comes to fatal accidents caused by earth-moving machines, seven persons died in 2019, while the number was five in 2020 and three in 2021. Citing an increase in fatal accidents caused by trucks and tippers, police are now carrying out a special drive against heavy vehicles, especially those that ply during peak hours. In September 2020, city traffic police had banned the movement of goods trucks, tippers and other heavy vehicles during peak hours — from 7am to 11am and 4.30pm to 8.30pm. More recently, police have been fining truck drivers for plying in the city during peak hours. The fine amount is Rs 500 for the first offence and Rs 1,000 for subsequent ones. Joint commissioner of police BR Ravikanthe Gowda said the drive will be continued. “Though we have restricted heavy vehicles during peak hours, some sneak on to the roads. From now on, we will regularly carry out special drives and ensure no heavy vehicles are on the road during peak hours.” Around 300 trucks and tipper trucks were fined for hitting the road during peak hours last week. Gowda added that traffic inspectors shall be held responsible if a heavy vehicle is involved in a fatal accident in their jurisdictions during peak hours.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/killer-trucks-claimed-at-least-15-lives-in-bluru-in-january/articleshow/89231663.cms||Rajiv Kalkod

On Saturday, the government announced resumption of offline classes from Monday. Many colleges immediately informed students about the development and asked them to plan their journey while giving them a week’s time to get back on campus. “We have already told them to be prepared to come. We will give only a week’s buffer time after the government declaration,” said Fr Abraham V, vice-chancellor, Christ (deemed to be university). Until then, many colleges plan to continue with the blended mode. “While local students can come to campuses for clarifications or other academic activities, outstation students can report back by next Monday. Until then, the blended mode will continue,” said Raghu R, spokesperson of Mount Carmel College. In an intimation to its students, Maharani Cluster University too said it will reopen on Friday to give sufficient time to outstation students to book return tickets to Bengaluru. However, some other institutions like Sheshadripuram Degree College, where locals comprise a majority of the students, will start offline classes from Monday itself. “We’ll decide on a blended approach depending on how it progresses,” said HN Meera, principal. Some other colleges plan to resume on-campus classes gradually. “Our end-semester exams will start on Tuesday and we will reopen for second and third years then. First-year students will continue with online classes as we don’t want a huge rush on campus,” said Paul Newman, principal of St Joseph’s Evening College. “Offline classes in the day college are likely by April as we wait for Covid cases to drop substantially,” he added. Jyoti Nivas College too plans to continue with online classes. While the government order on reopening of classes has still not been issued, Bengaluru City University said it will issue an order on Monday morning. Bangalore University said while on-campus classes for second-year students will start from Monday, first-year classes are likely to begin by next week, by when admissions will be complete.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/many-colleges-defer-opening-wait-for-outstation-students-to-return/articleshow/89231665.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas

Many of them have not been paid for more than three months. The BBMP official concerned, however, argued that the payments for two crematoria have now been cleared and workers will receive the money soon. He did not have details of the other 10 crematoria. Ravi N, a worker at Sumanahalli electric crematorium, told TOI: “My family has been working in crematoria for generations. I was born in a crematorium and have been working at Sumanahalli crematorium for 11 years. I have not been paid for three months. Since the start of the pandemic, we have been given just one PPE kit. We also require other safety gear such as gloves and boots even when we are not dealing with a Covid death.” A Suresh, state president of Ambedkar Dalitha Sangharsha Samiti, which represents crematoria workers, said that after they raised the issue several times, salaries were paid last year. “Things have now gone back to square one. Many workers at electric crematoria across Bengaluru have not been paid in over three months. In some cases, they have not been paid for nearly 11 months,” he said, adding that the employees have worked round the clock during some of the most difficult times the city has witnessed. Pointing out that it is not easy for these workers to quit their job and find another one, he said, “Not many people hire them after finding out where they have been working. They also do not have other skills.” ‘We have no other choice’“I have been working at Panathur crematorium since 2015 but have been paid for only two years. In 2018, it was made clear we are supposed to be paid minimum wage. We have no other choice and we continue to work. Families who come here tip us and sometimes buy us a cup of tea. This is how we have been living for over three years now,” said Girish KN. He added that during the peak of the second wave, workers were told to even make the bier for which they would be reimbursed. “We still haven’t been reimbursed,” Girish said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/many-crematoria-staff-not-paid-for-over-3-months/articleshow/89231666.cms||---

The central CEN crime police registered a case on January 24 against unidentified miscreants based on a complaint filed by the victim, a BPO employee. In his complaint, the victim said his girlfriend and he had spent some time in a hotel in Bengaluru a few weeks ago. Some miscreants allegedly recorded these moments in a secret camera and uploaded them on various porn sites. The incident came to light on January 21 when he opened one such site and found the video. He subsequently found the same video in other sites too. Police said the faces of both parties were blurred in the uploaded video. However, pointing to some physical attributes such as a birthmark on his chest, the victim claimed it was him. Police, however, suspect the video uploaded was not shot secretly as it covers the act from different angles. They have taken up a case and are investigating.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/youth-finds-his-own-video-on-porn-site-files-complaint/articleshow/89231668.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||HC cites errors in court finding, acquits vendor||Times News NetworkBengaluru: The high court has acquitted a Kollegal fruit vendor on the grounds that “neither the dying declaration of his wife nor the complaint lodged by her father or evidence of other witnesses even whisper about his intention to eliminate her permanently.”On October 26, 2017, the additional district and sessions judge at Chamarajanagar — sitting at Kollegal — had convicted the vendor Swamy for offences punishable under section 498(A) (simple imprisonment for one year and fine of Rs 25,000) and life imprisonment for offence punishable under section 304 part I IPC (causing death with intentional act). Swamy’s wife succumbed to injuries from self-immolation.An HC division bench headed by justice B Veerappa said materials on record clearly indicate the prosecution hasn’t proved the charge beyond reasonable doubt.The bench added the sessions judge erred in recording the finding that the fact that the victim poured kerosene in Swamy’s presence was just a triggering point for the accused to achieve his intention to eliminate her permanently, and hence, it is a fit case to invoke provisions of section 304 part I IPC wherein the accused had both knowledge and intention to eliminate her permanently. “This finding is perverse and without any basis,” the bench noted. It added the incident occurred due to self-immolation, only to teach a lesson to the accused.The bench also pointed to the statement of the doctor in the examination-in-chief that Swamy’s wife sustained about 75% to 80% burn injuries and the same occurred when she tried to die by suicide and he was informed about it. “Nothing has been placed before the court to prove that the self-immolation was at the instance of the accused. It is not in dispute that though the incident occurred on January 8, 2013, the statement of the deceased was recorded only on January 9, 2013 and she died in hospital on January 14, 2013...,” the bench observed.It added: “...It is also not in dispute that the accused has been in jail for more than seven years. Neither the dying declaration, complaint of the wife’s father nor any of the prosecution witnesses have whispered about the intention of the accused. Hence, the finding recorded by the learned sessions judge to invoke the provisions of section 304 part I of IPC is without any basis.” Swamy, a resident of Mulluru village, was married for five years. Around 9pm on January 8, 2013, his wife Asha allegedly poured kerosene on herself with an intention to threaten her husband since he was an alcoholic and was harassing her physically and mentally.

He had taken more than Rs 1.2 lakh from the victim and bought gold with it. The accused is Rajeshwar, from Maragondanahalli near Electronics City. Police said Rajeshwar, who had joined a private company after completing MBA, was unemployed for over a year. Police lodged a cheating and cybercrime case against an unidentified person based on a complaint by Prashant Kumar Jain, a businessman. Jain said his daughter joined an engineering college recently. She had got a seat for Electronics and Computer Engineering while her desired branch was Computer Science and Engineering. “We hoped my daughter would get a seat in CSE if any of the allotted candidates cancelled admission. On January 8, she got a text message that there were many cancelled seats and interested candidates could approach the sender to get one in their desired branch,” Jain said. The sender said aspirants needed to pay Rs 2.2 lakh to change branches. The victim transferred Rs 1.2 lakh to the mentioned bank account.  Upon Rajeshwar’s arrest, police also seized gadgets, seven SIM cards, a 21-gram gold chain, three gold coins, and more than Rs 1.7 lakh cash.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/mba-holder-dupes-engg-student-held/articleshow/89231671.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka Milk Federation set to change product name & packaging||BENGALURU: To regain trust and create awareness among the public about fake ghee packets in circulation, the Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF) is planning to change the packaging of its Nandini ghee and employ technology that enables product tracking. The move comes after the busting of a racket involving manufacturing and distributing adulterated Nandini ghee in multiple districts. The first instance of fake ghee was found in Mysuru, after which KMF’s special vigilance team found fake ghee in retail stores in Jayanagar, Srinagar, and two warehouses in Hoskote and Makali. Most of the products had arrived from Mysuru. During one of the surprise raids, officials from the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) seized material and sent it for testing. Subsequently, it came to light that an organised racket was packaging and selling adulterated ghee containing edible and vegetable oil and unknown animal fats in Nandini packets. According to a senior KMF official, the package design and name of the ghee will change soon. “...Earlier, we called it ‘Nandini’ pure ghee and now the name will be ‘Nandini Good Life’ cow ghee. The new package looks completely different and cannot be tampered with,” the official said. How to check purity of ghee Urging customers to be careful, officials said pure ghee is yellowish or golden in colour. “To increase the quantity, the racketeers often mix articles such as vanaspati, vegetable oil and fats. To check the purity of ghee at home, customers simply need to put a drop on their palm. If the ghee stays on the palm and does not flow, it is adulterated,” an official said. The official also said customers should be wary of retailers selling Nandini ghee at prices lower than MRP. “It is quite difficult to judge whether the ghee is pure or adulterated at shops. If the ghee has settled at bottom or is in solid form in the packet, it is better to avoid it. If it is in crystal form, it is pure and good.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/kmf-set-to-change-product-name-packaging/articleshow/89231673.cms||---

According to a study published in Nature Communications, in India, which still has a large heavy labour sector, this could entail the loss of the equivalent of multiple billions of work hours annually if the globe were to warm by 4°C.And as per analysis of this study by Statista, a German data company that does analysis and collates data from various sources, a warming of this magnitude is expected if the world continues on its current trajectory of greenhouse gas emissions. Last month, a study published in Nature Communications estimated that the current loss of heavy labour work hours due to heat in India stood at around 100 billion hours annually. Depending on the climate models used, it could already be as high as 259 billion hours, the same researchers have now said in January.As per the study — ‘Global labour loss due to humid heat exposure underestimated for outdoor workers’ — labour losses weighted by the working-age population engaged in outdoor labour are highest in South, East, and Southeast Asia where there are large numbers of working-age people working in agriculture.“...Specifically, labour losses are most pronounced in India, which accounts for almost half of the global total losses and experienced over four times the labour losses of the second most impacted country, China,” the report, a copy of which is with TOI, reads.The Statista analysis reads that if the world sticks to its climate goals and policies, a warming of 2°C to 3°C can be expected and according to the second study by these researchers, a loss of 100 billion Indian heavy labour work hours is equal to the loss of around $240 billion adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP),” the Statista analysis reads.Comparatively, in China, which has a similar population to India, only 21 billion to 72 billion work hours are estimated to currently be lost to global warming, as the country has transitioned away from heavy labour industries like agriculture and manual construction. “Other countries with large overall losses are Bangladesh, Pakistan, Indonesia and Sudan. The countries which are most affected in relative terms due to heavy labour taking up large shares of their economies are Qatar, Bahrain and the UAE,” the analysis reads.The researchers, pointing out that humid heat impacts a large portion of the world’s population that works outdoors, say previous studies have quantified humid heat impacts on labour productivity by relying on exposure response functions that are based on uncontrolled experiments under a limited range of heat and humidity.“...Here we use the latest empirical model, based on a wider range of temperatures and humidity, for studying the impact of humid heat and recent climate change on labour productivity. We show that globally, humid heat may currently be associated with over 650 billion hours of annual lost labour (148 million full time equivalent jobs lost), 400 billion hours more than previous estimates. These differences in labour loss estimates are comparable to losses caused by the Covid-19,” the paper reads.Globally, they say, annual heat-induced labour productivity losses are estimated at $2.1 trillion in 2017 PPP, and in several countries are equivalent to more than 10% of gross domestic product. “...Over the last four decades, global heat-related labour losses increased by at least 9% (more than 60 billion hours annually using the new empirical model) highlighting that relatively small changes in climate (less than 0.5 C) can have large impacts on global labour and the economy,” the researchers say.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/global-warming-to-cost-india-100bn-work-hours-per-yr-study/articleshow/89231672.cms||---
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Mamallapuram, ECR getaway spots crowded||CHENNAI: Mamallapuram and other getaway spots on the ECR witnessed a surge in the number of visitors on Sunday, the first weekend after the total lockdown on Sundays was lifted. But it may take a few more days for occupancy rate of hotels to improve. There was only a marginal increase in room occupancy because a majority of the visitors were those who drove down from Chennai. However, the return of visitors soon after restrictions were lifted hint at the way things are going to be in the coming weeks. The prohibition and excise department order allowing clubs and hotels to operate bars from 11am to 11pm or midnight and round the clock for star hotels with the required license is also expected to help. Mamallapuram town panchayat statistics show that around 15,000 people visited on Sunday, which is almost on a par with the usual weekend numbers. The tourism department said 1,550 visitors came to Muttukadu on ECR. Mamallapuram-based tourist guide R Stalin said that "people also arrived by overcrowded transport corporations buses from Chennai and Chengalpet. It was like they were waiting for the lockdown to be lifted. A majority of the visitors returned the same day. We did not have tourists from other states who usually stay for a day or two." Such short trips comprising locals did not translate much into business for resorts and hotels on ECR as they got only 50% to 60% occupancy on Sunday. J Sethuraman of Travelxs said that most of the hotels lost around 80% of the business due to the lockdown on Sundays. "Small hotels got around 50% of occupancy on Sunday because of the arrivals. This will increase in the coming weeks when people start coming from southern districts and neighbouring states as restrictions have been lifted from February 1." Chengalpet district collector A R Rahul Nadh said that enforcement teams comprising revenue, police and local body officials have been formed to ensure that Covid protocols are not violated in the tourist spots at Mamallapuram and other tourist attractions in the district. South India Hotels and Restaurants Association (SIHRA) honorary secretary T Nataarajan said that the occupancy rate in star hotels in Mamallapuram has been low since the beginning of this year as people are afraid to travel after a spike in the number of Covid cases.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/mamallapuram-ecr-getaway-spots-crowded/articleshow/89231675.cms||---

Five workers were injured. The vehicles belonged to Greater Chennai corporation's conservancy contractor Urbaser-Sumeet. A couple of hours after the accident, TOI lensman Ramesh Shankar, who reached the spot and tried to shoot a photograph, was surrounded and manhandled by staff of the conservancy agency. They did not relent even after he informed them that he is a photojournalist from a newspaper. Ajith Prakash, a worker, snatched his camera in a bid to prevent him from taking photos of the accident. Ramesh had to call police to get his camera back. Police said Vignesh, 30 of Besant Nagar, who was driving the truck, died on the spot. The truck collided with the sweeper vehicle, lost control and fell into the marsh. The vehicle was not removed till afternoon. Mehmood Sait, chief executive officer of Urbaser-Sumeet, said that the accident occurred around 3.30 am. “A mechanical sweeper that runs at a maximum speed of 10km per hour was cleaning the road. This garbage truck was trailing behind. However, we have no idea what happened after that. “The truck hit the sweeper and toppled and fell into the marshland. We brought in cranes and earth movers. However, we couldn’t save the driver,” he said. He added that they are awaiting a medical report on what caused the accident.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/driver-killed-toi-lensman-attacked/articleshow/89231677.cms||---

The areas that were managed by municipalities of Tambaram, Pallavaram, Pammal, Anakaputhur and Sembakkam maintain a different system and network to assess and collect tax while the system is different for areas managed by town panchayats of Chitlapakkam, Madambakkam Perungalathur, Peerkkankaranai and Tiruneermalai.Tambaram corporation commissioner M Elangovan said that "We will start a massive exercise to integrate the property tax system in the areas that are under the corporation. Now, we have kept them separately as before. The work to integrate will start after the election is over." The situation faced by the newly formed Tambaram corporation is unique because different municipalities and town panchayats that do not have uniform growth in infrastructure and amenities have been merged to form a new corporation. "Not all areas have underground sewage systems, drinking water supply and other amenities. This is reflected in the current tax structure. All areas do not have online payment options. There is also a delay in registrations due to absence of integration of the tax system. This has to be set right, said M Govindarajan, president, Federation of Residents Welfare Associations of Tambaram Corporation.D S Sivasamy, a retired municipal administration official said "There is a lot of work as the corporation will have to bring in a uniform levy of taxes. Property tax, license for traders, fees and others are all assessed at different rates. These may have to be made uniform. Residents can continue to pay the old rates but there will be a problem if litigation arises."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/property-tax-rates-to-be-made-uniform/articleshow/89231678.cms||---

The 38 deaths took the cumulative death toll to 37,544. By Sunday evening, the state had 2.03 lakh people still under treatment for the viral infection. Chennai, which continued to report the highest number of new cases also saw the steepest decline. The city reported 3,998 new cases compared to 4,508 on Saturday. Coimbatore, which had the second highest number of new cases, reported 2,865 compared to 3309 on Sunday. Four other districts Chengalpet (1,534), Tiruppur (1,497), Salem (1,181) and Erode (1,127) reported more than 1000 cases each. Perambalur (52) reported the least number of cases followed by Mayiladuthurai (98) and Vellore (110). Along with cases, the number of samples also came down to 1.28 lakh. Director of public health Dr T S Selvavinayagam said that the tests have come down because the state no longer tracks and tests contacts of people who tested positive. Only people who show symptoms such as fever, running nose, sore throat and cough are tested. Hospitals too don’t make tests mandatory for admissions or other procedures unless they see symptoms of the disease, he said. The number of active cases in the state dropped to 2.03 lakh, but less than 4% of them required hospitalization. Out of 8,229 patients admitted 1023 were in ICU. Nearly 90% of beds across the state were vacant. Out of the 38 deaths, there were ten in Chennai, six in Chengalpet and five in Trichy. While Madurai reported three deaths, Coimbatore, Tiruppur and Tiruvallur reported two each. Eight other districts – Salem, Thanjavur, Namakkal, Thiruvarur, Tenkasi, Kallakurichi, Theni and Nagapattinam --reported one death each.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/new-cases-dip-in-all-districts/articleshow/89231680.cms||---

It will lead to exclusion of poor. Rich students who go for coaching out-compete poor students," he said.Professor Anil Sadgopal, former member of Central Advisory Board of Education, said the anti-NEET bill was unanimously passed with 230 MLAs supporting it. "Such legislation is sitting in the office of the TN governor for more than four months. Not forwarding this bill to the President amounts to violation of the Constitution and basic principles on which our parliamentary democracy is founded,” he said.V Vasanthi Devi, former vice-chancellor of Manonmaniam Sundaranar University, urged Tamil Nadu to mobilise national level support to bring education back to the state's list from the concurrent list. “There should not be a NEET in TN. It is the voice of people.” she said.P B Prince Gajendrababu, general secretary of SPCSS-TN, said chief minister M K Stalin should mobilise people in support of the bill in order to get President'snod.DMK Rajya Sabha member T KS Elangovan said during the British rule diarchy ( shared rule) system was followed in which elected assembly and British governor coruled presidencies before independence. “Now, the elected state government is ruling TN. The DMK had made an election promise that it would abolish NEET for medical admissions. After coming to power, the DMK government passed a bill to nullify NEET for medical admissions. However, the person appointed as a representative to the state i refusing to forward the bill,” he said. VCK leader Thol Thirumavalavan said getting the President's assent to the anti-NEET bill should be the interim goal and main objective should be bringing the education back to state's purview. CPM state secretary K Balakrishnan, CPI state secretary R Mutharasan and Congress floor leader in the assembly K Selvaperunthagai also spoke at the event.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/parties-urge-governor-to-send-neet-bill-to-president/articleshow/89231681.cms||---

N Viswanathan, an advocate and civic activist who visited a PDS shop in KK Nagar to buy rice and sugar, said he didn’t receive the bill. “When I logged into the portal, I found they had even included dal. This has happened several times before. I have complained to the PDS department, corporation and CM’s Cell. Every time they close the complaint saying they have taken action but we are not informed what the action is.” The staff at the outlet, Viswanathan said, also forced him to purchase items such as mustard seeds and pepper that he didn’t need, saying he would be given free rice only if he bought them. B Babu, another resident from the area, said he went to the PDS outlet two days ago. “They said they will not give me more than 5kg rice. I thought there was a shortage. But the SMS to my phone that came after four hours showed that they had billed for 10kg. Moreover, they forced me to purchase other grocery items such as soap.”Over the years, biometric system and e-billing have been introduced, but the problem continues. Sandhya V of Anna Nagar said the biometric machine at her PDS outlet was defunct most of the time. “Whenever we complain, they call us for an inquiry and take action such as penalising the supervisor. But that doesn’t deter them.” A PDS department official who didn’t want to be named said they had taken action whenever they receive complaints. “People in posh localities who don’t purchase many items or certain items such as dal can give it up by logging into the portal to reduce illegalities.” In this case, he promised action and said he would inspect all outlets.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/pds-workers-bill-people-for-items-not-purchased/articleshow/89231683.cms||Komal Gautham

In an open letter to party cadres on Sunday, the CM has urged them to settle their seat sharing with allies without any hitch, work for the victory of the DMK-led alliance across the state and ensure good governance.  Stalin also urged cadres to expose “BJP’s detrimental politics” and its alleged attempts “to plant seeds of religious hatred” among people in TN, who are living in harmony. “Expose the two parties (referring to the BJP and the AIADMK), which are against the welfare of the people, and tell them that the state would never permit a non-secular force to get a foothold in the state,” he said. Stalin said he had already held consultations with the district secretaries, MPs and MLAs on the election preparations. Once the seat sharing is completed the party candidates should be selected strictly, like the army selection process, he said. Selecting candidates, sharing of seats and seeking votes should be done in coordination, with a single goal of victory, said Stalin. Leaders of the alliance have assured their support to all the constructive actions of the DMK government, he noted. “Our alliance should not be a mere election tie-up; it should be a secular alliance, which is policy and development oriented,’’ the chif minister said. “Local administration is the basis of good democracy. It will pave the way for the government’s schemes to reach the people at the tail-end. People can also get their needs met. The DMK is a movement that has always ensured that the local body is strengthened at all cost,” said Stalin.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/stalin-no-ticket-for-cadres-with-criminal-cases/articleshow/89231684.cms||---
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: BJP wants 20% seats in 2022 civic polls, AIADMK finds ally over-ambitious||CHENNAI: There was little progress in the AIADMK-BJP talks on seat sharing for the urban local body polls on Sunday with the central leadership of the BJP yet to approve any decision. Meanwhile, the AIADMK moved ahead and released its first list of candidates for the Cuddalore corporation and the municipalities of Cuddalore, Villupuram and Dharmapuri. The BJP held another day-long internal discussion on the AIADMK’s offer for 10% seats, but there was no public announcement until late evening on Sunday. A senior BJP leader said, “We had asked for 30%, especially in Coimbatore, Tirupur, Trichy and Kanyakumari, later we brought it down to 20%. The party will make an announcement on Monday.” BJP state unit president K Annamalai is expected to make the announcement. “If we decide to go it alone, it will be a friendly contest,” said the BJP leader. “We will remain allies and pursue respectful politics.” He said leaders in Delhi were concerned that announcing a break-up may affect the party’s image ahead of the upcoming assembly elections in other states. AIADMK has its reasons to keep more seats. “Every party has high expectations. While we have to consider them, we have to consider the interests of our party and partymen as well,” said former minister and AIADMK steering committee member D Jayakumar. “They are asking for a large number of seats; we are confident of arriving at a consensus.” In Tiruchy, Annamalai told reporters, “We should be given a decent number of seats in our areas of strength. The bigger party should be generous and give in to the smaller party’s demand.” Local concerns have much to do with the BJP’s demands for 20% of the seats as it plans to make inroads into the Dravidian turf and strengthen its participation in local administration. The AIADMK’s apprehensions, meanwhile, are about its ally’s victory prospects. The BJP’s demands include four of the 21 mayoral posts – three in the western belt and one in the south, where it believes it has strengthened its base. With local chieftains and politics in the districts bound to sway outcomes, the AIADMK is worried about losing to the DMK in case transfer of votes to its allies fails.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/bjp-wants-20-seats-in-civic-polls-aiadmk-finds-ally-over-ambitious/articleshow/89231685.cms||Jaya Menon

In search of business, stalls too have shifted to the area behind Light house and no norm seem to be observed. The situation prevails throughout the week. Adding to the chaos are roadside eateries encroaching upon pavements along Loop Road. Visitors can easily enter the Foreshore Estate side of the beach from Santhome High Road. “The government can as well open the beaches as the restrictions make no sense. Those who come to the eateries along Loop Road throng the beach as do those who come to shop for fish,” said N Murugan of Mylapore. With only walkers allowed on the Marina in the mornings, the footpath along Loop Road could have come in handy and regular beach goers want the authorities to address these concerns. “Footpaths should be for pedestrians. Thousands of people gather at the Marina beach for their morning and evening walks and when physical distancing is required, authorities should not allow such rampant encroachments,” said A Gnanaprakash, a regular to the Marina beach. The overall Marina beach regulation scheme itself has gone awry after the Madras high court stopped monitoring it on a day-to-day basis. Greater Chennai Corporation, burdened with pandemic management, has also become slack, allowing encroachers an extended time on the beach and along Loop Road.

---||Chennai||Construction equipment makers plan to go electric||Chennai: After passenger and commercial vehicles, another segment is getting ready for an electric charge — construction and industrial equipment. Top names in the business like JCB, Volvo CE and Schwing Stetter are either already working on electric versions of some of their big yellow machines or conducting feasibility studies for the launch of select global e-applications in India.“The construction equipment industry is seriously looking at electric mobility options, particularly for applications where we can pack a viable battery size,” said Dimitrov Krishnan, MD of Volvo CE India & president of the Indian Construction Equipment Manufacturers’ Association (ICEMA). Volvo, he said, has five electric models it has just launched globally — 3 excavators and 2 loaders. These are available in Europe and US and already 300 machines have been delivered. “We will launch them in India too and we are currently evaluating options,” said Krishnan. “Because of the higher cost, we will have to find a business model that is viable,” he added.Others like Schwing Stetter India are looking for specific areas where electric mobility solutions can be used. “A 100-horsepower engine product that works inside tunnels used for metro, road or hydro power projects can use e-versions effectively because it will cut out exhaust fumes. We are attempting to convert applications like these to electric versions,” said V G Sakthikumar, MD of Schwing Stetter India. With lithium ion battery production being localised, both by Indian as well as MNC players, sourcing battery is no longer an issue, he added.Indeed, the construction equipment industry’s baby steps into e-mobility is also an opportunity for local battery makers. Take Nexcharge, a joint venture between Exide and Swiss lithium ion battery maker Leclanche, which is already working with companies on e-applications. “Earth moving and off-highway equipment makers are opting for lithium ion battery-powered forklifts, excavators, etc, and a number of OEMs are working with us to electrify construction equipment machines. We are working with JCB, for instance, though the numbers are still small,” said Mehul Shah, VP (transport BU) at Nexcharge.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/construction-equipment-makers-plan-to-go-electric/articleshow/89231687.cms||---

They were, however, in for disappointment as the retail market offered lesser quantity and fewer varieties of fish for sale. South Indian Fishermen Welfare Association president K Bharathi said the crowd started arriving at the retail market as early as 5am. The sale, however, began only around 6am. With less catch arriving to the harbour, many buyers could not get the fish they were looking for, he said. One of the fish vendors in the market, A Balaraman, attributed the fall in catch to the rough seas near the harbour. "In the past three days, the sea was rough and there was a change in the weather conditions. Owing to the inclement weather, many fishermen didn’t venture out into the sea from Kasimedu. Those fishermen who went in on Wednesday and Thursday returned to the shores with their catches," he said. Those catches, however, were not sufficient to meet the demand of the customers on Sunday. On the other hand, crowd at Chintadripet fish market in the city was thin on Sunday morning as most fish buyers had headed to Kasimedu hoping to buy a variety of fish, one of the fish vendors at Chintadripet fish market said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/customers-throng-kasimedu-harbour-but-not-much-fish/articleshow/89231689.cms||P Oppili

The man, identified as Samsudeen, went to wedding halls posing as a guest and stole cameras when photographers left them unattended. Samsudeen used a bicycle for his trips to the halls to make it appear that he was a local and to avoid identification through registration number. Police said many photographers, who had lost their cameras thus, had taken up the matter on social media. Based on orders from Chennai police commissioner Shankar Jiwal, a special team headed by deputy commissioner (Kilpauk) K Karthikeyan was formed to probe the case. During the investigation, head constables Saravana Kumar and Rajesh and constable Maheshwaran, who were going through CCTV footage from Villivakkam, noticed a man pedalling a bicycle with a white mudguard. On Sunday, the same personnel found the man on the bicycle while they were sipping tea at a shop in Villivakkam. Sensing something amiss, the policemen followed him and detained him while he was attempting to enter a wedding hall. Police said Samsudeen was an alcoholic. "He waited until the photographers were called to have food. Moreover, a camera fetched him a lot of money," said an officer. He targeted wedding halls in areas such as ICF, Mylapore, Nungambakkam, Kodambakkam, Ambathur, Avadi and Nazarathpet. He sold the cameras to brokers and spent the money on alcohol, according to police.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/man-poses-as-guest-at-weddings-decamps-with-cameras-arrested/articleshow/89231690.cms||---

---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Raw sewage flooding Adyar river||CHENNAI: The Adyar river, which was recently cleared off garbage and sewage by the floods, is now getting contaminated again, this time by sewage discharged into it by metrowater pipelines. Owing to a pipeline burst, Metrowater has been discharging 30-40 MLD of untreated sewage to Adyar estuary near Thiru Vi Ka Bridge for over two days now. The board had recently taken up work to replace 350-metre-long sewage pipelines, with a diametre of 1000m. One of them, however, burst owing to it being corroded and the board decided to divert the sewage into the estuary. A group of bird enthusiasts who visited the area for a bird census found the discharge. Several activists from the area are also speaking with officials, asking them to divert the sewage. E D Babu, a marine biotechnologist, told TOI that the river has been getting polluted for the past two decades. "Nonetheless, discharge of so much raw sewage into the estuary is unacceptable. This is the place where aquatic animals and birds from both the ocean and the river settle to breed and feed their young,” he said. A Metrowater official told TOI: “We didn’t expect that the pipeline would burst. It carries sewage from a pumping station to Perungudi sewage treatment plant. We will divert it at the earliest. In fact, we are replacing these pipelines to prevent such issues,” he said. C R Balaji, an activist from the area, has lodged a complaint with the CM cell. “I have been noticing a lot of illegal discharge into the river due to corroded pipelines,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/raw-sewage-flooding-adyar/articleshow/89231693.cms||Komal Gautham

Several IAS Officers of 2016-batch were not given postings by CM KCR until the Union secretary intervened. “IAS and IPS officers are not keen to be posted in Telangana due to the strategy adopted by CM KCR by giving retired IAS and IPS officers the posts of Advisors to the state government as they would toe the party line,” Uttam said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/plum-posts-for-those-who-toe-trs-line/articleshow/89231736.cms||---

The party has demanded justice in terms of devolution of funds, sanction of projects and implementation of promises made to it in the State Reorganisation Act. The TRS has also decided to boycott President Ramnath Kovind’s address on Monday to both the houses in a joint session of Parliament. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Union Budget on February 1. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao gave directions to this effect to the party MPs from Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha at a meeting held here on Sunday to discuss the strategy to be adopted by the TRS in the budget session of the Parliament starting on Monday. The TRS has nine members in Lok Sabha and seven in Rajya Sabha. Those gathered were of the opinion that the boycott of the President’s address would send a strong message to the BJP government about how serious the TRS is about the Centre’s continuous neglect of Telangana. “The CMO has listed out 23 issues concerning the development of Telangana which are pending with the central government. Based on the allocations that would be made to Telangana in the Union Budget 2022-23, the TRS MPs will raise the issues in both the houses to corner the Centre for discriminating against Telangana in the budget session,” TRS MP G Ranjit Reddy told TOI after the meeting. The chief minister, his cabinet colleagues and chief secretary Somesh Kumar have been writing letters to PM Narendra Modi, union ministers and secretaries seeking implementation of promises made to Telangana in State Reorganisation Act.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/trs-to-take-on-centre-seeks-justice-in-budget/articleshow/89231738.cms||Roushan Ali

Archaeologist Dr E Sivanagireddy along with others visited and surveyed the Megalithic burials known as cist burials located on either side of the road leading to Ramaswamy Gutta. After conducting a thorough survey on the local hill and the surroundings, Dr Reddy revealed that there are only 10 burials existing now out of 100 due to active agricultural operations. “These burials known as Rakasigullu denote the burial practices of the Iron Age in which the dead were interred in a stone chamber covered with a huge capstone and demarcated by a circle of natural boulders around,” he said. Around 20 cup marks on the top side of one of the capstones were also spotted. They depict star constellations and opined that these cup marks bear a lot of significance on astronomical grounds, he added. Dr Sivanagireddy noticed grooves of the Neolithic period(4000 BC ) on the rear side of the Ramaswamy temple located on the hill top.

But, for the sportspeople in the Old City, the place holds a historic significance and stands as a lucky charm to them. From launching the footballing career of former Indian Football Team captain Shabbir Ali to standing as a practice ground for Indian cricketers like Venkatapathy Raju and Noel David, the place lights up with numerous memories. A most recent memory would be on Republic Day when British deputy high commissioner Andrew Fleming witnessed a Football league match between Abbas Union Football Club (AUFC) and City College Old Boys. AUFC made a dramatic victory at the last minute at their lucky home ground at Dar-ul-Shifa. “So, who remembers when a late goal in a big cup tie would prompt this kind of crowd reaction?” Fleming tweeted sharing a video of the win. Speaking to TOI, Shabbir Ali, former Indian Football skipper, reminisces that he began playing at Dar-ul-Shifa ground around 50 years ago as he started his career with AUFC and eventually played for several top clubs in the country. “The ground has gifted livelihoods to several people. There were times when local Mosque authorities planned to plant trees in the ground. But the sports community ensured that the purpose of the ground remains the same,” Ali told TOI. Another state-level player and the current AUFC’s coach Sajjad Mamba explains that the premise has a sporting history even before their generation. It has been the home ground for AUFC since its inception back in 1938. Prior to that, the ground did cater to various kinds of sports and training for Olympians. In terms of cricket, the place enabled the launch of several Ranji players like retired wicketkeeper-batsman Youraj Singh who played for Hyderabad and for the South Zone and now currently works as a referee for the BCCI. “We used to travel 10 to 15 kilometres to play our matches after I joined All Saints school which had a specialised focus on cricket. I eventually got selected to the Ranjis and the rest was history,” Singh told TOI.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/dar-ul-shifa-place-that-holds-hyds-sporting-memories/articleshow/89231747.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

Moreover, property owners of the Cantonment will finally get rid of abnormal taxes, there will be a relaxation in floor space index (FSI) and other issues,” said S Ravinder, secretary, NGO Cantonment Vikas Manch. Seconding this, retired Army major general Shiv Kiran, also executive vice president of the United Federation of RWAs (UFERWAS), said, “the livelihood of those living in the Cantonment will improve and all welfare schemes of the state government will be extended here too once civil areas are de-notified.” Members of other RWAs also felt that overall development including infrastructure like flyovers, foot-over bridges and underpasses to ease traffic, would be made on par with the neighbouring GHMC. They urged MoD to take their suggestions before formulating a policy on excision of civil areas of the Cantonment. However, some people did voice apprehensions saying that once excision is completed, development projects also need to be taken up. “Unless basic amenities are provided and surrounding areas developed, the excision concept will remain a one-side exercise,” said DLS Sreshti, secretary, Confederation of Cantonment Residents Welfare Association (CCRWA).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/people-welcome-excision-ask-for-better-amenities/articleshow/89231750.cms||Sunil Mungara

Tony, who came to India in 2013, told cops that in Hyderabad he knew some Nigerians but so far did not reveal that he has used them for peddling activity. Cops focused on money transactions and realised that on Tony’s instructions, his trusted lieutenants, Imran Babu Sheik and Noor Mohammed Sheik, always insisted on cash payments. “They used to accept UPI transactions from clients very rarely,” said an investigator. Tony would not use popular social media platforms and used WhatsApp without DP to communicate with clients. “When he wants to verify the client’s surroundings, Tony would cover his cell phone camera and make facetime video call. Only two of Tony’s Mumbai-based associates, Irfan and Aftab, have seen him and only one of them met Tony. “Tony met one businessman from Hyderabad personally because he has been a regular customer for about two years. Tony said that two customers we arrested would buy 5gm cocaine from him almost every weekend,” police said. As Tony deleted all his social media content after his two associates were arrested, police sent phone for data retrieval.

In case of previous Covid-19 variants, some co-morbid patients ended up with heart damage and some died due to heart ailments due to Covid-19 complications. Doctors said that even as Omicron variant is milder in nature, recovered patients are at higher risk of heart ailments such as cardiomyopathy, blood clotting, palpitations, breathlessness among others. “Many recovered patients are complaining of breathlessness and palpitations. The virus leads to inflammation of the blood vessels resulting in blood clotting. This may in turn lead to risks such as suffering a heart attack, so they should be careful while exercising,” said Ganesh Manthan, cardiologist at Mathan’s medical centre. Speaking at a health discourse organised by HEAL Foundation, a nationwide health group, Dr Mohit Gupta, professor and cardiologist at GB Pant Hospital, Delhi said that the virus can cause acute myocardial injury and chronic damage to the cardiovascular system. “Covid can prove to be fatal for patients already suffering from heart-related disease. In recovered patients, four prominent issues such as difficulty in breathing, chest pain, fainting, weakness and heart damage were observed,” said Gupta. In some cases, those with underlying heart ailments have observed aggravated symptoms. “People have faced gastric issues due to which they often experience heart burn post-recovery. Adding to this are symptoms such as decreased blood pressure levels, high sugar levels, chest discomfort among others,” said Dr Sagar Bhuyar, senior cardiologist, Kamineni Hospitals, LB Nagar. Doctors advised that soon after recovery, people should take things easy for almost a month as those who start exercising rigorously are at the risk of suffering a heart attack. “For almost 60-90 days after recovery, people should not venture into any strenuous activities. They should take things slow and start with some gentle exercising regime. The heart rate needs to be monitored as many people have also complaint of having arrhythmia post recovery,” said Dr Sadiq Azam, consultant cardiologist at KIMS.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/covid-hit-patients-must-watch-their-heart-experts/articleshow/89231754.cms||Preeti Biswas

Authorities tightened security in all old city vaccination centres to ensure that no one gets a certificate without taking the jab and kept a tab on all data entry operators. Police have urged local religious leaders and community elders to call meetings and inform people not to fall prey to people offering money against fake certificates. Other than traders, those who have high BP, thyroid and are diabetic, have also taken fake certificates. “In the entire process, people directly approach middle men to get the process done and take away forged certificates clandestinely. These are mostly traders who have to go in and out of the state,’’ a police investigator told TOI. With a vast majority of people in the old city still in a dilemma whether to take vaccine jabs or not, police and civic authorities have come forward to urge people to go ahead without any fear. “More than 40 per cent people have not taken the jab and look for alternate way to skip the dose,’’ Dastagir one of the residents from Khilwat told TOI.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/cops-traders-mostly-taking-fake-certs/articleshow/89231755.cms||---

Currently, the state has vaccinated 67% of people in this age group. The health department is preparing to complete this drive with the use of a mobile van drive and has contacted school and college administrations in this regard. The vaccinations will be administered in the presence of teachers by authorities. Steps are being taken to educate students on the importance of getting vaccinated. According to officials, a majority of students and others from educational institutes have become infected, posing a risk to the elderly and people with comorbidities. “Completing the vaccine drive will help to curb the spread to some extent,” a top official said. The vaccine drive was very slow during the first week of administration, but after constant persuasion, it picked up. In the districts, Vikarabad, Ranga Reddy, and Kumarambheem have yet to complete 50% of the vaccine drive, while Hanumakonda is at 98%. In Mahbubnagar, Narayanpet, Wanaparthy, and Khammam nearly 90% of target group has been vaccinated. Jogulamba Gadwal, Mulugu, Nirmal, Sangareddy, and Adilabad have completed more than 80% first dose coverage for this age group. Surprisingly, Hyderabad is one of the districts with the lowest coverage so far at 51%. Officials said some parents and students are still hesitant to take the vaccine and are under the impression current a wave is mild. “We are approaching such people and convincing them to take jabs,” an official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/1st-dose-vax-for-15-17-group-in-focus/articleshow/89231756.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Hyderabad||Telangana saw 21,000 excess deaths in first two waves: Study||HYDERABAD: Telangana had 190 percent excess Covid mortality rate during the first and second wave, according to a research study. It also revealed that the all-India excess mortality was six to seven times higher than official figures. The research study published in the eminent scientific journal, Science, showed that there were 21,000 excess deaths during 2021 as against 11,000 excess deaths in the year preceding the pandemic in Telangana. This showed that there were 10,000 excess deaths, which stands at 190 per cent. Hyderabad had reported most number of Covid-19 deaths, only due to serious cases from districts and other states being referred to tertiary care hospitals in the city. However, the study did not mention the figures city-wise. The data provided was only of state-wise figures and national average. In case of another Telugu-speaking state, Andhra Pradesh, there were 51,000 excess deaths during 2021 in comparison to 36,000 excess deaths during 2018-2019. This in other words mean AP has recorded 140 percent relative excess deaths. However, Andhra Pradesh had less number of excess deaths during the Covid-19 period, compared to Telangana. Telangana stood third in the country in terms of relative excess deaths, below Gujarat (230 per cent) and Madhya Pradesh (215 per cent). The researchers said AP had high coverage of expected rural deaths in facilities. The major increase in number of deaths during April-May 2021 was for unknown cause, followed by non-tuberculosis respiratory conditions, heart disease and other chronic disease. “Our study finds that Indian Covid-19 deaths are substantially greater than estimated from official reports. If our findings are confirmed, this may require substantial upward revision of WHO’s estimates of cumulative global Covid mortality, which as of January 1, 2022, stood at 5.4 million,” the researchers said. The research team was drawn from University of Toronto, Centre For Voting Opinions and Trends in Election Research, IIM Ahmedabad, Development Data Lab and Dartmouth College. The team comprised Prabhat, Yashwant, Chinmay, Wilson, Aditi Bhowmick, Sankalp, Paul, Sze Hang, Leslie, Hellen and Patrick. Stating that the analysis of increase in overall mortality may better capture the diverse diseases affected by Covid-19 infection, the researchers said delays in death registration or a backlog of deaths corrected suddenly might create a spurious peak of excess deaths. At all-India level, Covid constituted 29 per cent of deaths from June 2020 to July 2021, corresponding to 3.2 million deaths, of which 2.7 million occurred in April-July 2021, when Covid-19 doubled all-cause mortality, the study said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/t-saw-21k-excess-deaths-in-first-two-waves-study/articleshow/89231757.cms||Syed Akbar

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Many exposed to Covid-19 ignore tests, isolation||HYDERABAD: Three out of every four people in the city have tested positive for Covid-19 in their close network of family, friends and neighbours in the last two weeks, revealed a survey by a citizens engagement platform. The third wave of Covid, driven by the Omicron variant, spread widely resulting in large prevalence of the infection. To understand how the situation has changed since December 10, 2021, LocalCircles — the citizens engagement platform — conducted a survey which recorded responses of more than 18,500 respondents from various cities, including Hyderabad. “The percentage of citizens who know over five individuals in their close network testing positive in the last 30 days have shot up from nil on January 3 to 23 per cent on January 10. It has further increased to 36 per cent on January 17. This means that Covid prevalence shows continued rise,” read the survey. As per the survey, 77 per cent of the citizens have someone tested positive in the last 30 days. Almost 41 per cent of the citizens said they have one or more individuals in their close social network who despite having Covid-19 symptoms in the last 30 days did not get an RT-PCR test done and have also ignored self-isolation norms. “Most of the people are now preferring to either take the home antigen test or skipping the testing altogether, thereby, treating Covid-19 infection like regular viral fever. Many leading scientists around the world are advising against this approach but it is being widely adopted in India now,” read the survey.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/many-exposed-to-virus-ignore-tests-isolation/articleshow/89231759.cms||---

In addition, at least 15,000 directors face disqualification as the companies they are representing failed to file returns to ROC of the ministry of corporate affairs in the past three years. The ROC had served notices to these companies in November and had given them one-month time for filing annual returns. The ROC has excluded the companies floated by the state and central governments from the strike off. Non-Banking Finance Companies (NBFCs) and Nidhi companies were also kept out of the list. “Most of the company directors don’t know that they have to file annual returns and balance sheets with ROC. They were under the impression that filing income tax and GST returns would suffice. Another important aspect is that several companies couldn’t do any business due to lack of investments and didn’t file annual returns,” an official of the ministry of corporate affairs said. Meanwhile, around 5,000 more companies that have failed to file commencement of operations will soon be served notices by ROC. “A declaration has to be filed in Form INC-20A within 180 days of the company’s incorporation regarding the commencement of business. Several start-ups failed to file this. There are around 5,000 more such companies identified in Telangana,” said an official of the ministry of corporate affairs.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/roc-strikes-off-over-6000-companies-in-telangana/articleshow/89231760.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

---||Hyderabad||Karvy CMD a tough nut to crack for ED officials||HYDERABAD: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) seems to have been caught in a tough challenge while probing the role of Karvy Stock Broking Limited (KSBL) chairman and managing director C Parthasarathy in the multi-crore stock broking scam during the four-day custody that ended on Sunday.  Sources in the ED said that Parthasarathy had asked ED officials to provide him with a bed as ‘he can’t sleep on the hard floor’. He also asked for a western commode in the bathroom as it was an Indian commode in the ED lock-up. Parthasarathy has also asked the officials to limit the time for questioning from 10am to 5pm. When ED officials told him to write answers to the questions on a paper, Parthasarathy reportedly told ED officials that he suffers from arthritis and can’t move his fingers. The ED is now planning to file a petition to extend his custody. Parthasarathy is involved in diverting clients’ securities to the tune of 2,873 crore. The ED has grilled Parthasarathy over fund diversion to Karvy Realty (India) Limited and to 14 shell companies. The ED has also arrested G Krishna Hari, CFO of Karvy Group, for charges of money laundering. The ED had filed a case under Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) based on the FIR filed by HDFC bank with central crime station (CCS), Hyderabad police against Parthasarathy and Hari, alleging that they were the main conspirators. The accused diverted funds by layering through a series of transactions from several accounts of group companies. KSBL allegedly availed loans from non-banking finance companies (NBFC) to the tune of 400 crore in the name of five shell companies by pledging shares of KSBL clients. The ED has so far frozen shares of Parthasarathy worth around 700 crore. It is probing the money trail to trace the proceeds of crime which are close to around 2,000 crore.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/karvy-cmd-a-tough-nut-to-crack-for-ed-officials/articleshow/89231762.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

Cops have managed to freeze Rs 3 crore of the siphoned off money. Investigators suspect that the hackers remotely gained access to the server of the bank through phishing attack. Police have identified the four customers of AP Mahesh Co-operative Urban Bank, from whose accounts 12.9 crore was transferred to 128 different bank accounts across the country. Police have identified the customers as Shahnaz Begum of Golconda, Vinod Kumar from Pardhiwada, Naveen from Nagole and Sampath from Kukatpally. While the bank officials said that the fraudsters moved the money from their remittance account to the account of some customers and from there transferred the money to 128 accounts, investigators so far have not obtained any clear evidence showing such a transfer. Police questioned Vinod and Sampath, from whose accounts about 5 crore and 5 lakh were transferred. Cops are yet to zero in on Naveen and Begum, whose accounts were used for transferring over 7 crore. “We found the two customers we questioned, Vinod and Sampath, were unaware of the transactions,” said a cop. Cops are trying to locate Begum, whose phone was traced to Mumbai and Naveen, whose phone is switched off.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/cops-hunt-for-crooks-who-withdrew-9cr-siphoned-off-cash/articleshow/89231764.cms||---

---||Kolkata||195 e-vehicles registered in Kolkata last year, but sales figure may be 35,000+||KOLKATA: Only 195 electric vehicles were registered in Kolkata in 2021. It was a four-fold jump over the previous year, but the numbers could be misleading. The actual sale of EVs is being pegged at over 35,000 by transport officials, as many low-speed e-scooters and e-bikes do not require registration. And, with nearly all auto companies set to introduce more EVs in 2022, dealers expect a substantial jump in sales this year. According to Public Vehicles Department (PVD) records, the number of new EVs registered in the city was just 47 in 2020 and 21 the year before. But the figures do not reflect the actual scale of shift to EVs, with dealers of branded and non-branded low-speed e-scooters and e-bikes clocking record sales in 2021. “Vehicles powered by a 250-watt motor and capable of accelerating only up to 25kmph do not require to be registered. Hence, it is difficult to fix a number to it. But the estimate would be upward of 35,000,” said a transport department official. While availability of e-vehicles is a factor, what has prompted the migration is the record jump in fuel price. Experts predict sharper e-vehicle growthWith cost of operation as low as Rs 1-Rs 1. 2 per kilometre, investment in even an expensive EV is pragmatic and viable. Both the transport and environment departments pin their hope on electric vehicles as the game-changer for the city’s environment and its climate resilience. “Zero-emission vehicles and solar-powered charging facilities will reduce the city’s huge burden of particulate pollution,” said WBPCB chairman Kalyan Rudra. Of the 197 electric vehicles registered with PVD in 2021, 137 are fourwheelers. There are only 53 high-pow- ered two-wheelers with more than 250-watt motors capable of speeds in excess of 25kmph. Experts predict an even sharper rise in growth of EVs in the city this year following introduction of newer models, high price of petrol and diesel, and the demand for personal vehicles due to the fear of catching infection in public transport staying high. “As electric vehicles become more affordable and the battery range increases, the demand will zoom,” said P K Bose, an automobile expert and former director of NIT, pointing out that many are beginning to overcome the initial reluctance in embracing EVs. “A new technology always requires its ecosystem to blossom — public charging infrastructure, charging facilities at parking lots, battery-swapping facilities. Once these are in place, the market share of EVs in the overall sales pie will increase rapidly,” he added. Transport department officials said the state’s EV policy would also give a fillip to sales in 2022. The policy proposes incentives like public charging stations at every 25km across the state’s national and state highways, special green corridors for EVs and dedicated inter-district corridors for green mobility.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/195-e-vehicles-registered-in-kolkata-last-yr-but-sales-figure-may-be-35k/articleshow/89231727.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Kolkata||Trinamool won’t focus only on Pegasus in Parlimaent||KOLKATA: With opposition parties pitted against each other in five election-bound states, the first phase of Parliament’s budget session from January 31-February 11 may see a divided opposition speaking on multiple issues. While Congress is likely to increase its pitch on Pegasus, Trinamool Congress on Sunday indicated it does not want to focus only on Pegasus and wants to raise issues of attacks on federalism. “Pegasus is a key issue, but we think focusing on it alone will undermine all other issues,” a senior TMC leader said. “We want to raise the issue of federalism, particularly the motions on the Governor and proposed changes to the IAS (Cadre) Rules, 1957. We believe the issues will unite the opposition, since several states have opposed the proposed changes on the IAS issue,” he added. “The budget session will be held in two phases. The second phase, which will be held from March 14 to April 8, immediately after the poll results, is likely to see more opposition floor coordination on multiple issues. But now, due to the elections, by raising only Pegasus the din may shut out the other burning issues, including those which are key poll issues in the five states, like employment,” the leader said. TMC is contesting in Goa, where BJP, Congress and AAP are also in the fray. In Punjab, AAP, BJP, and Congress are in the fray and in Uttar Pradesh, the Samajwadi Party, BJP and Congress are in the fray, making it difficult to join voices in Delhi and speak out against the other in the states at the same time, said sources. In Goa, TMC and Congress and in Punjab, AAP and Congress have already targeted each other. During the winter session, Trinamool repeatedly questioned the Congress-led opposition and insisted that Congress be a part of the opposition. TMC said while Congress’s track record against the BJP had been dismal, Trinamool had defeated the saffron party resoundingly in Bengal in 2021. Party leaders said that the March 10 results will have a bearing on the second phase of the budget session. Another senior TMC leader said, “The issues will unite the opposition, like it has done in the past. On the IAS issue, several states have already spoken out. They will lend their voice against it. The governor issue isn’t just limited to Bengal. Several opposition states are also facing the same. There are also issues like employment, which need to be addressed immediately. We have spoken on Pegasus before; we will speak on it again.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/trinamool-wont-focus-only-on-pegasus-in-parl/articleshow/89231772.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: 5,655 commercial vehicles, all 15 years old, to be phased out in 2022||KOLKATA: A whopping 5,655 commercial vehicles will be phased out in 2021-22 for turning 15 years old, revealed the report of the transport department committee formed under the order of National Green Tribunal (NGT). In 2008, Calcutta High Court banned commercial vehicles aged more than 15 in the Kolkata Metropolitan area (KMA) on the premise that older commercial vehicles with old exhaust mechanisms pollute more than newer vehicles with superior emission-control devices. Times ViewWe need two things and we should strive for both simultaneously: older, more-polluting vehicles must be phased out as soon as possible and they should be replaced with newer, less-polluting vehicles. Government agencies should try and work out the logistical issues, like facilitating soft loans and getting more clean-fuel stations on the road.In a case filed by green crusader Subhas Datta in connection with vehicular pollution in the twin cities of Kolkata and Howrah, the bench of Justice B Amit Sthalekar (judicial member) and Saibal Gupta (expert member) asked for a report of actual phasing out of older, polluting vehicles in these cities. Over-15-year- old vehicles were found to be three times more polluting than vehicles younger than that. The report said that RTOs of KMA, inclusive of Kolkata and Howrah, have denied renewal of certificate of fitness and registration to 3,09,417 commercial vehicles till December 31, 2019. Datta said, “Many of these vehicles are still plying illegally and polluting the air of the city as these vehicles are system locked, but not physically scrapped.” The report also admitted that in accordance with the current statutory provision, there is no specific life of a motor vehicle after which it may be deregistered. The report thus recommended that, if found plying after the notified three months, commercial vehicles older than 15 years are liable to incur a heavy penalty as may be determined by the government as pollution cost, and the vehicle will be impounded and scrapped. The phasing out, transport operators said, will impact public transportation. Around 943 metered cabs and 502 luxury cabs, which include app-cabs, will be phased out. The 5,655 vehicles include 625 buses (37-41 seats) and minibuses (28-31 seats) and 126 omni buses (more than 41 seats). According to transport operators, the phasing out of so many buses will create a gap which will be difficult to bridge because of low registration of new buses. The older vehicles, experts said, produce more pollution because of incomplete combustion of fuel. They exhaust a higher amount of particulate matter, including a very high amount of finer particulate matter (PM2.5). This is why superior combustion engines have been introduced in the form of BS-II, BS-III, BS-IV and BS-VI vehicles. BS-VI, for instance, is 50% less polluting than BS-IV vehicles. In case of BS-VI vehicles, the NOx emission rate can come down by approximately 25% in case of petrol engines and 70% in case of diesel engines.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/5655-commercial-vehicles-all-15-yrs-old-to-be-phased-out-in-2022/articleshow/89231774.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Kolkata||West Bengal to seek AAI nod for relaxation of 40km-distance rule for second airport||KOLKATA: The state is set to approach Airports Authority of India seeking a relaxation of the maximum distance criteria of 40km between a new airport and the city so it can propose a site in Kalyani, around 58km from the city and around 43km from NSCBI airport. Sources in the state said Bhangar, the site it was exploring for acquisition of 7,000acres, may not be feasible as it comprises wetlands and multi-crop agricultural land. While acquiring wetlands may disturb the ecological balance of the region, farmland acquisition is a prickly issue that can spark an agitation. The Trinamool government had come to power in 2011 riding on the uprising in Singur and Nandigram against farmland acquisition. Since coming to power, the government has also stressed on a policy for zero-forcible acquisition of farmlands. In a recent communication, state chief secretary H K Dwivedi had directed South 24 Parganas DM P Ulganathan to earmark a plot of around 3,000hectares in Bhangar for setting up the city’s second airport to reduce congestion at Dum Dum. However, an assessment over the past week has revealed that the earmarked zone at Bhogali–1 gram panchayat in Bhangar has 30-odd cemeteries, 80-odd large fish bheris, more than 150 small fish bheris, and more than 6,000 residents at Nangla and Palpur villages along with several thousand acres of farmland. Another thing that has been worrying the state is the history of Bhangar, where a project of the Power Grid Corporation had faced serious land acquisition-related hurdles. Anti-airport construction sentiments and demonstrations had started in the area when preliminary talks were on, which has prompted the state to look for other alternatives. “The zone identified in Bhangar has too many bheris and farmland that can hamper the ecological balance and also give rise to major scarcity in food supply as it supplies a large chunk of the city’s vegetables and fish,” said a source. The AAI, since 2018, has been writing to the state to identify land for the second airport in the city in line with Mumbai, New Delhi and Chennai, where work for second airports is underway. The Kolkata airport has a 2,33,000sqm integrated terminal size that can accommodate a maximum of 24 million passengers per year. Had Covid not wreaked havoc, airport sources said, it would have reached saturation level by this time and crossed 26 millions by 2030, the deadline set by the AAI for the construction of the second airport. According to the Centre’s guidelines, the second airport should be at least 4,000 acres so all modern facilities can be in place. But the state is looking for 7,500 acres as it wants to create excess capacity in the future.  “Kalyani is barely 50km away from the city and has good road connectivity. The town has research institutesand scope for development,” a government source said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/state-to-seek-aai-nod-for-relaxation-of-40km-distance-rule-for-second-airport/articleshow/89231775.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Tech boost in Salt Lake for cop-resident interaction||KOLKATA: Police-residents WhatsApp groups are quickly replacing age old block committee meetings in Salt Lake in the post-Covid world as residents in the township are demanding more interaction with cops following daring robbery attempts at multiple households last week. Block committee meetings, where residents of particular Salt Lake blocks met with senior police officers at their community centres discussing everything from security measures to road conditions and safety of elderly residents, had been a regular activity for decades. However, post-Covid the frequency of such meetings dipped because of the safety protocols. With elections due in two weeks, the officers stressed no fresh meetings can be planned. “We cannot hold such mass interaction programmes in closed community halls with elderly residents at present. In turn, we have increased our activity and interaction on WhatsApp groups where residents can directly voice their grievances and needs to the officers of the local police station,” said a senior officer of the Bidhannagar commissionerate. Last Monday, a group of burglars had targeted at least four houses at AH block in Salt Lake but had fled the scene injuring two policemen, following a timely alert by a group of neighbours. Elderly residents of the township said that they often find it unsafe to stroll out even during daytime. “The robbery attempt at AH block has been a chilling reminder for me when a miscreant had snatched away a gold chain from my neck some years back in broad daylight. Police patrolling should increase,” said octogenarian Krishna Chakraborty, resident of IA block. A few block committees are continuing with the night guard system. “The interactions need to be expedited. But we realise the limitations in physical meetings because of Covid protocols. Hence we have expedited our interactions with the officers of Bidhannagar north police station over WhatsApp and calls,” said AA block committee secretary Partha Chakraborty. According to cops, the residents also need to instal CCTV cameras. “We have been telling the residents in past meetings to instal CCTVs on the lanes and bylanes of the blocks. However, very few have listened,” said another official.  While AE Block Samaj Kalyan Sangha secretary Tapas Sengupta feels installing CCTV cameras and regular maintenance is a challenge, some have actually taken the measures. “We have installed eight CCTV cameras in the BE block community centre and plan to install wireless CCTVs on 10 entry points of the block,” said BE block Nagarik Sangha secretary Narottam Dutta.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/tech-boost-in-salt-lake-for-cop-resident-interaction/articleshow/89231777.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Genome sequencing for critical Covid patients||KOLKATA: In a first such study in the country, the state health department, in collaboration with MR Bangur, a nodal government hospital for dedicated Covid treatment, has started sequencing genomes of critically-ill patients to find out whether they have been infected by Omicron or Delta variants. All these patients are elderly with comorbidities. A senior Swasthya Bhavan official said, “Though Omicron infections are supposed to be clinically milder, quite a few with comorbidities continue to remain at high risk for complications, and are occupying the ICUs and CCUs of hospitals. We want to find out which of the two existing variants they have got.” The official added, “Much as we wouldn’t like to oversimplify the severe cases, considering there are multiple factors responsible for severity of infections, it’s still crucial to know whether these ICU patients have the Omicron variant. If so, we should also know why they have turned critical despite preliminary data indicating that Omicron is mild. Or is it not mild to the point that nothing will happen? If the study shows that most of those in the ICUs have Delta, then we will conclude that Delta is still raging.” Sisir Naskar, superintendent, MR Bangur Hospital said, “The idea is to access the different strains of Covid virus responsible for varied morbidity patterns. We have sent samples of those seriously ill, those requiring oxygen and other support.” Once the study is complete, there can be a definite interpretation of the current trend of the pandemic. For instance, around 80% of the existing Covid cases are reportedly Omicron. The rest are supposed to be Delta.” The hospital sent 59 samples till Monday - all belonged to elderly patients, in a clear indication that those critically ill are over 60 years with comorbid conditions. In fact, all the 61 Covid patients in MR Bangur’s critical care unit (CCU) are elderly. They constitute 40% of the 170-odd admitted in the hospital.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/genome-sequencing-for-critical-covid-patients/articleshow/89231778.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

This was announced by the film-maker’s son Kunal, who played a part in recovering many of these documents and transferred them to the university last year. Among the important papers, photographs and correspondences are his awards, including the Padma Bhushan medal. According to Kunal, who is based in Chicago, it is a “pity” that Sen “discarded” most of his important papers. Last April, TOI reported that Kunal has transferred some documents to the institution in Illinois, USA. His father, a globally renowned auteur from Bengal, didn’t believe in preserving, Kunal said. “My father was never very organized. Saving relevant papers from a mountain of junk takes discipline. Since he didn’t sort them when he could have, they accumulated in huge piles under our bed and in rafters. When the time came to move home, the easiest thing was to throw them out. He disliked nostalgia and quickly lost interest in his old creations,” he said. The university’s website mentions that the collection contains papers, press clippings, including those about the damage to and restoration of his early films, photographs, correspondence, and documents for Gita Shome Sen, an actor and the film-maker’s wife. There is also some correspondence with Kunal Sen. The collection is part of the Hanna Holborn Gray Special Collections Research Center, University of Chicago Library. The four-part series is divided into papers, film and public career, photographs and awards. In a box is kept the Premio di Selezione award for ‘Calcutta ’71’. The Auguste & Louis Lumiere – Cinematographe also finds pride of place in the collection, apart from a metal for the Ordre des Artes et des Lettres (Republique Francaise), the Award of Friendship medal from the Russian Federation, the Gold Hugo Award trophy for ‘The Ruins’/’Khandhar’ from the Chicago International Film Festival in 1984 and Bronze Hugo Award trophy for ‘Kharij’ from the Chicago International Film Festival in 1983. The collection also has Sen’s speeches, film proposals, book chapters from 1970 to 2012, cartoons of Sen and his passports. The Kunal Sen papers have a copy of the 2019 obituary for Sen that was read out to the Bengal Assembly. Kunal, the chief information officer at Encyclopedia Britannica, said Sen’s handwritten scripts and letters exchanged with legends of world cinema would have been of interest to many, but are unavailable. However, the collection hasn’t been digitized yet. This will take a long time and will happen when research grants are in place.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/mrinal-sen-papers-awards-now-part-of-chicago-univ-collection/articleshow/89231779.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

They (Tiwari and Jayprakash) have not joined any other party after they were suspended. They have come to me to convey their grievances and there is nothing wrong in that. I will speak to the central leadership over organizational issues,” Thakur said. The Union minister has already sought time from Shah to discuss issues relating to Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). “We have an association (of Matua community) and there is pressure on us to implement CAA,” Thakur said. He is also likely to meet President Ram Nath Kovind. State BJP leaders, who earlier indicated they were on the same page with Matuas on their demand for citizenship, did not want to cast any aspersion on Thakur’s meetings and picnics. “He is a respected leader and he can arrange picnics. MLAs can meet him and he can also speak to the national president. There is nothing we can object to,” said Sukanta. “I had a word with him (Thakur) a few days back. Any difference of opinion can be sorted through discussions and we feel it will be done quickly,” he added.Trouble, meanwhile, started brewing in Bankura over the new district committee. The Chhatna block mandal president resigned along with several BJP workers. RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat is scheduled to arrive in Kolkata on Monday for two-day-long meetings. He will discuss organizational issues and plans to expand the Sangh’s base in Bengal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/bjp-rebel-thakur-off-to-delhi-may-meet-nadda-and-shah/articleshow/89231780.cms||---

Sen also pointed out that the state of Arunachal Pradesh was ‘demarcated separately’ from the rest of India on the map.The MP said he came across the map while searching for data on the ‘WHO Covid 19.int’ website. “I was surprised to find that Jammu & Kashmir had two different colours on a map which displayed the data of the area on which you click. When I clicked on the differently coloured portion of Jammu & Kashmir, the data displayed was that of Pakistan. Yet another portion had the data of China,” said Sen.It was a serious violation of international norms which should have been noticed by the government of India, he said. “I am surprised that our government has not taken note of this yet. This should be taken up for correction immediately and the central government should take appropriate steps,” Sen told TOI on Sunday. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/tmc-mp-writes-to-pm-on-wrong-covid-map/articleshow/89231782.cms||---

The online panel discussion on “Industrial Heritage of Kolkata” that followed, in association with Intach, was an instant hit with the audience, for the sheer historical anecdotes that the participants had to tell.Gautam Ray, executive director (HR and admin), CESC, spoke of how Calcutta was electrified barely a decade after London to achieve a “milestone in the world’s electrical energy”. Not many would be aware that among CESC’s first consumers were Bank of Bengal (SBI) and Bengal Club, Governor House and Calcutta High Court, said Ray.According to K Mohan, director (personnel), Andrew Yule, his 56,000-strong employee company in 1947 had grossed a Rs 23crore turnover and paid Rs 1.8crore to the state exchequer, to become one of the highest revenue contributors those days. Balmer Lawrie CMD Adika Ratna Sekhar said, “Our company, which celebrates its 156th Foundation Day on February 2, never made a loss because it always saw the changes coming and changed itself accordingly.” Namit Shah, MD, F Harley and Co, claimed his organisation, founded in 1825, was the oldest. “We have been a small fish in a large pond. Our Rs 30-40crore company managed to sail through because we were nimble-footed, did not carry the baggage of huge assets.”Intach director GM Kapur, who is BCCI’s chairperson, heritage committee, said, “The webinar has given us quite a few insights into corporate strategies and could well serve as lessons in advanced company management.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/bengal-chamber-fetes-iconic-members/articleshow/89231787.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

Train movement along this railway tracks had to be stopped between 10.45pm and 11.45pm on Saturday. The youths, all aged 18 and 19 years, claimed they were trying to drop off one of their friends in Kasba when the faulty GPS-enabled app showed them the wrong route, taking them to the railway tracks. The three were later granted bail. The Ballygunge GRP has lodged an FIR against the driver. The RPF has lodged a separate FIR against the car’s occupants. Cops said two of the accused had misbehaved with both the forces when they were trying to remove the car from the tracks. A beer can was recovered from inside the seized car. But cops said a medical test of the men at CNMC confirmed they were not drunk. Cops said their faulty GPS app logic was “not too convincing” and it looked like a “desperate attempt to reach destination in the shortest possible time and looked like an act of mischief”. Cops added that the study of the Google map, which they were using, has not supported their claim. The Ballygunge GRP and RPF stated it was the railway employees and passengers who had first noticed the car. “It was around 10.30pm that some youths drove the four-wheeler recklessly and arrived on the railway shunting track near the office of the GRP police station at Ballygunge. We found a black SUV on the shunting track and two persons standing beside the car looking helpless. Another person was trying hard to remove the car from the track. We jointly detained the three persons,” said an officer from RPF. The driver was an 18-year-old who resides at a condo on Prince Anwar Shah Road. His 18-year-old friend resides at another condo in Anandapur off EM Bypass while the other friend, aged 19 years, is a resident of Sector II in Salt Lake. “While being interrogated, the driver stated that they were unaware about the road and had entered the railway track through the Ballygunge railway siding after travelling underneath Bijon Setu. During detention, the two friends of the driver misbehaved and obstructed us from carrying out our work,” said a GRP officer. The GRP said they had slapped IPC sections pertaining to rash driving, danger or obstruction in public way or line of navigation, act so rashly or negligently and causing mischief against the driver. The three were later released on bail. A separate case under sections 146 (obstructing railway servant in his duties), 147(trespassing) and 145 (nuisance) Railway Act was registered against the two friends of the driver at the RPF Post Ballygunge. Further investigation is on in this case.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/teen-drives-car-80m-on-rly-tracks-while-returning-from-birthday-party/articleshow/89231790.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Fifteen of them sustained serious injuries. Among the injured were three women and two children. The youngest victim is nine-year-old while the oldest one is 72-years-old. Around 35 passengers, including women and children, had boarded the bus at Park Circus and were headed to Bankra in Howrah to attend a marriage reception. The injured passengers were reportedly discharged from SSKM Hospital, barring the 17-year-old Md Hasan with a leg fracture and the 38-year-old Munni Begum with bleeding injuries on her head. The incident happened around 2.10pm. Mayor Firhad Hakim reacted strongly after the accident, saying it was illegal to ply such unfit buses in the city and asked the transport department and the Regional Transport Authority (RTO) officials to identify such buses immediately and prosecute the offenders with the help of Kolkata Traffic Police. Hakim hinted that the state transport department and cops will begin a crackdown on such buses immediately. Cops said the minibus was registered with the Howrah RTO and owned by Sk Gorai, Bankra resident. Currently, the bus has eight cases pending in court and other 195 cases pending with police. The cases are mostly pertaining to signal and stop line violations. Reports also suggested that the bus was registered in 2009 and had a valid CF till 2018, after which it wasn’t renewed. The bus was playing without a valid insurance. Izaz Anwar, a footpath vendor, who was hit by the bus, said, “It swerved dangerously, climbed onto the footpath and hit the lamppost before it overturned. There was a loud noise of tyre bust.” Izaz had a lucky escape as he suffered a few bruises on his face. Cops, fire brigade and disaster management personnel (DMG) rushed to the spot and rescued the trapped passengers. Munni Begum, 38, was barely conscious with bleeding injuries on her head. Md Hasan, 17, had a fractured leg. The rest were discharged from hospital late. Sainaz Begum, who was treated at the SSKM Hospital, said, “The bus was running at a high speed when the incident took place. We heard a loud sound and then the bus overturned. We are lucky to have survived with minor injuries.” Tabea Khatun, another injured person, said, “We got trapped inside the bus and cops rescued us. There would have been a disaster, had all of us remained trapped inside.” Md Safiq, who was travelling in the bus, said, “We had also boarded the bus at Park Circus and were going to the same marriage party.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/minibus-with-over-200-pending-cases-against-it-topples-at-esplanade-27-injured-2-in-hosp/articleshow/89231794.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The idea, coming soon after the fatal accident on Friday morning, was initially proposed three years ago by the Garia Traffic Guard.The main focus, claimed cops, was to ensure that around 50 % of the unused portion of the bridge’s northern side was used to ensure smooth flow of vehicles.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/cops-want-dhalai-bridge-expansion-write-to-kmda/articleshow/89231799.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Ravi latest talent to make an impact at U-19 WC||Kolkata: The Under-19 World Cup has served as the launching pad for a number of talent and on Saturday, India’s Ravi Kumar became the newest member on that list. The left-arm pacer’s brilliant first spell of 5-1-5-3 broke the backbone of defending champions Bangladesh and helped India beat them by five wickets and make the semifinals.The Bengal pacer ended with three for 14 from his seven overs. “The plan was to create pressure in the initial overs,” he said after the match. “We had played them earlier too (in Asia Cup and Tri-series in Kolkata), so I had an idea about their batters.”West Indies all-rounder Carlos Barthwaite was quite impressed by the youngster’s bowling. “I haven’t seen such good swing bowling with the white ball for long,” he said. “Ravi did not try to experiment much and never bowled short, making the batters play on the front foot.”Much like his senior statemate Mohammad Shami, Ravi came to Kolkata to make a mark in cricket. Although born in the city, his family moved to Aligarh in Uttar Pradesh. Like any other kid, Ravi started playing tennis-ball cricket. It was coach Arvind Bhardwaj who noticed him during a local tournament and approached his father. But CRPF jawan Rajendra Prasad wanted his elder son to study and get a good job. However, Arvind kept pursuing him and finally the father relented. Ravi returned to Kolkata and started staying with his uncle.He shone in the CAB pre-season T20 tournament, and that caught the attention of former national selector and Bengal U-19 coach Devang Gandhi and assistant coach (bowling) Jayanta Ghosh Dastidar. Their efforts made Ravi a better product.He got included in the Challenger Tri-series in Kolkata as a replacement for one of the first-choice players. He took four wickets in four games with an economy rate of 4.5 in the Youth Asia Cup in the UAE.Ravi returned 4/34 in the high-scoring warm-up game against Australia U-19 and picked up one wicket against Ireland.

---||Kolkata||‘Extension of realty sops to boost demand, push sales’||Kolkata: The real estate industry in Bengal is expecting a 25% jump in sales in next two months following extension of 2% stamp duty concession and 10% reduction in circle rate to home buyers from January 31, 2022 to March 31, 2022 by the state government. The government had announced the concession during the state budget on July 7, 2021 to give the sector, that had taken a hit due to Covid, a booster shot. Later it was extended twice. The jump could result in sales of over Rs 25,000 crore in February, March taken together, feels the industry captains. Initially, the relief was on offer till October 30, 2021. That was extended till January 31, 2022 following pleas from Credai that cited time lost in initial technical hiccups at the registration offices and then inconvenience to customers due to monsoon and new Covid wave. Credai West Bengal president, Sushil Mohta, said it is bullish about the demand following the extension. “We are expecting 1,500-2,000 units to be registered per month following this extension. It is generally 1,000-2,000 units monthly,” he added. Mohta said there has been a 100% jump in registration in August, September and October 2021 following the duty cut and reduction in circle rate. Credai Bengal president Nandu Belani also feel that there will be generation of fresh demand. “It will be a win-win situation for both state government and the real estate industry,” he added. As per Credai, every month real estate transaction in the state is worth Rs 8,000-9,000 crore in general which had witnessed bullish trend this month due to the dual concessions. Mohta also argued that a lot of pending cases also got registered during this period. “Historically, there were a lot of pending cases which got registered. These are 15-20-year-old cases,” he added. Credai National president H V Patodia felt that the extension of stamp duty remission and circle rate reduction for a further two months by the Bengal government is a welcome move and will benefit the customers and help in boosting the demand for the real estate industry in difficult times where we are witnessing a very good demand revival. Vice president of Credai Bengal, Siddharth Pansari feels that this should motivate the indecisive customers to purchase the home that they have been considering for quite a while. “It will boost economic activity and job creation as well,” he added. MD of Siddha Group, Sanjay Jain, said the buyers who have bought houses in last few months couldn’t avail of the benefit because of festive season in December and Covid wave in January. “This quarter is the financial year ending quarter and also a decision-making time and hence, a good time for buying a house. I expect the state may earn very high volume of revenue in these 2 months,” he added. Incidentally, as per figures available in the January-December 2021 period, registration of residential sale deeds stood at 44,940, 64% more than the previous year when the figure was 27,328.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/extension-of-realty-sops-to-boost-demand-push-sales/articleshow/89231805.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Kolkata||Clamour for school reopening grows among parents and teachers but some still wary||Kolkata: A significant decline in Covid cases has yet again sparked the debate on when children should go back to school.Several parents’ forums have argued that away from the classroom for almost two years, many students — particularly those from financially disadvantaged backgrounds and without access to online teaching mode — have not learnt much in the past 22 months, prompting concern on whether they will ever be able to make up for the lost learning in the formative years.The High Court is also hearing a PIL on the issue.Several heads of institutions and teachers are also in favour of school reopening as they are finding it difficult to solve students’ problems remotely.The West Bengal Academy of Paediatrics in a letter to CM Mamata Banerjee has also favoured reopening. The letter read, “We have now a large amount of clinical data available that indicates that Covid infections are relatively mild in children, with less than 2.5-3% of affected children being severely affected. Case fatality rate in Bengal is 0.08% of all infected children in the age group of 0-15 years, as per the state health bulletin. Research in children has found that in-person learning by opening schools does not increase baseline hospitalisation rate. Multiple studies have shown that transmission within school settings is typically lower than or at least similar to level of community transmission, when preventive strategies are in place in school.”The education department has also decided to experiment with an open air classroom in neighbourhoods to wean back kids who have dropped out of the formal education system due to the prolonged time of staying away from school.“We want schools to reopen immediately maintaining all Covid guidelines,” said Supriyo Bhattacharya, a member of the United Guardians’ Association, a loosely strung body of parents of private schools affiliated to different boards.“My child is a Class-IV student of a private school. I have noticed many behavioural changes in him in the last two years. I’m really worried about their mental health because this is not a solution,” said Sukanta Sikdar, a guardian.A few parents, however, remain sceptical. “I want to send my child to school. But what if he contracts Covid and something happens? I will never be able to forgive myself,” said Saheli Mitra, mother of a Class-VI student.“Online classes can never be an alternative to physical interactions, especially for analysis, scientific reactions, mathematical problems etc. Inclusive learning is impossible in online studies,” said Uttarpara Government High School science teacher Saugata Basu.“Our teachers have been trying so many ways to make online classes more interesting. But it is still nowhere close to a physical class with students present before the teacher,” said Delhi Public School New Town principal Sonali Sen.Future Foundation School principal Ranjan Mitter agreed. “It’s not just learning gap. Students are facing health, psychological and social issues that may cause long-term damage.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/clamour-for-school-reopening-grows-among-parents-and-teachers-but-some-still-wary/articleshow/89231807.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Travel industry looks to take off after dip in Covid case load||KOLKATA: A significant number of Kolkatans have resumed travel, both to weekend destinations as well as to other parts of the country within three weeks of the third wave reaching its peak in the state. While doctors have cautioned against revenge travel and gatherings, many of those who recovered from Covid or Covid-like symptoms in recent weeks have regained confidence and started meeting at house parties or small getaways at resorts. “Earlier this month, my entire family was diagnosed with Covid. I didn’t get tested but had similar symptoms and stayed in isolation. But it was far less severe than the symptoms I had last year when I had tested positive. Once I got better, I realised there was no point staying back home and planned a quick trip to Darjeeling two weeks back before I set out for work at an outdoor fashion shoot in Varanasi last week. I am maintaining all caution but there is no point shying away from travel,” said Sutirtha Basu, a fashion photographer from Jadavpur. Behala resident and restaurateur Rahul Sarkar set off for Goa with two of his friends last week on a nine-day trip. “We had planned this trip a long time ago but had decided to shelve it when Covid count was on a steady rise in the city. All of us had fallen sick. As the Covid count started dipping, we stuck to our old plan and set out for the long awaited trip,” said Rahul, who is currently in Goa. According to travel agents, tour operators and airline officials, the industry is on road to a quick recovery after a sudden setback around the last week of December. “The exponential rise in Covid numbers during the last week of December that forced restrictions had left us worried about the fate of the industry. We were just recovering from the twin blow of the two Covid waves when the third one hit again. But the faster the infection had spread, the quicker people healed and numbers came down. Now, clients who had cancelled their bookings are contacting us again to resume travel. This indicates that people have started adjusting their lives according to the rise in infection. I guess, this will be the trend in the coming years as well,” said Anil Punjabi, chairman (east) Travel Agents Federation of India. Hoteliers in popular tourist destinations like Mandarmani, Bolpur and Darjeeling said people have started coming back, though in smaller numbers. “Hotels have opened and tourists are slowly returning. The quicker the panic goes and people learn to live with the pandemic, the better it will be for our industry,” said Deb Dulal Das of Mandarmani Hoteliers association. Resorts and getaways near the city are also receiving queries. “This week, we had 80% occupancy. We are expecting 100% over the next two weeks,” said Subhadip Basu, GM, Ibiza — a resort and spa in South 24 Parganas. However, doctors are still wary of travel and believe it could lead to Covid protocol violation. “Even if someone has recovered from Covid, one cannot be careless and shun mandatory protocols while travelling. Travel only if it is necessary and wear masks always,” said internal medicine consultant Rahul Jain.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/travel-industry-looks-to-take-off-after-dip-in-covid-case-load/articleshow/89231808.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Pumping station, sluice gates to check sector V flooding||KOLKATA: The Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority (NDITA) has prepared a detailed plan, after consultation with experts, to prevent waterlogging in the Sector V IT hub before next monsoon. Plans are to set up new flap shutters and sluice gates on the eastern drainage canal along with a new drainage pumping station and repairing and revamping the drainage network system. NDITA officials said that new flap shutters and sluice gates will be installed on the eastern drainage channel at three outlet points to prevent back flowing of storm water during heavy rain. “The drainage networks of Sector V are mostly connected with the eastern drainage channel where the excess rainwater of entire Sector V gets drained out. During heavy rains the canal water level is rising as the excess rainwater is not drained out resulting in waterlogging. The new sluice gates will have one-way valves which will close the lid of the outfall lines to prevent back flow of water,” said a NDITA official. The authorities have already initiated the process to engage an agency to install the new systems for which Rs 1.3 crore has been estimated. A new drainage pumping station will also be set up near Sector V Metro station. Currently there are four pumping stations in Sector V and each has three pumps. The higher capacity pump can discharge water at 2,000 cubic metre per hour and each of the two smaller pumps have a capacity of 1,000 cubic meter per hour. The new pumping station will also have pumps of same configuration. “The drainage condition have deteriorated in some places which will be repaired and revamped,” said an official. The IT hub along with areas of New Town and Salt Lake have been witnessing severe waterlogging for the last few monsoons. The major reason has been the overflowing Bagjola and Kestopur canal. The irrigation department will start desilting of both canals from February onwards. Hidco too has started working to excavate the internal link canals flowing in New Town for revamping which is expected to be completed by this June.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/pumping-stn-sluice-gates-to-check-sec-v-flooding/articleshow/89231811.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal govt set to take a call on Covid curb relaxation at meeting today||KOLKATA: With Bengal positivity rate at 6% and 5.1 crore people fully vaccinated, the state government on Monday will decide whether to extend the restrictions or give more relaxations in February, including reopening of educational institutions. The state cabinet meeting scheduled on Monday coincides with the last day till which the ongoing restrictions are in place. The Bengal global advisory board has also favoured reopening of educational institutions for the vaccinated age-groups by mid-February. It was on December 28 when the state positivity rate was lower than 6% after which it started spiking sharply. According to sources, Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee is likely to convene the meeting on Monday. During the last January 6 cabinet meeting, several of her cabinet colleagues could not join but on Monday, all senior ministers are likely to attend. The state has given several relaxations, including allowing 200 people at marriage receptions at a time. It has also given its nod to holding fairs. A source indicated, “Among the proposals which are likely to be placed before the CM are relaxations in night restrictions from 11 pm, and not 10 pm. Also, a staggered reopening of the tourism sector. The issue of reopening educational institutions will also be placed before the CM.” Ahead of the state cabinet meeting on Monday, the global advisory board members, including its chairman Nobel laureate Abhijit Vinayak Banerjee, has already advised CM Banerjee to go ahead with reopening of schools and other educational institutions by mid-February with vaccination completed in the age group of 15-18 years. Sukumar Mukherjee, a member of this board, said, “We have shared our thoughts on it with the CM to enable reopening of schools and educational institutes by mid-February. He said, “We want that all the students in the age group of 15-18 should get their first dose of vaccination. Moreover, we advised that there should be special attention for double-dose vaccination of the elderly people at home so that even if the students carry home the virus, the elderly patients remain safe.” He said Omicron is mild and hence the advice for reopening of schools. Officials said the Centre had hinted that the vaccination of the children in the age group of 12 to 15 years may start from March. So, drive for those in the 15-18 group needs to be completed by February. Meanwhile, tour operators and travel agents had earlier complained that they were being pushed to the wall amid the pandemic. They had appealed to the state to relax norms for tourism.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/govt-set-to-take-a-call-on-covid-curb-relaxation-at-meeting-today/articleshow/89231812.cms||Debasis Konar

Police on Saturday had summoned Parashar for interrogation where he was questioned about his relationship with another accused Ramkripal Meena. Officials confirmed that they had found Parashar's involvement after Meena's interrogation. Parashar is now the 36th accused arrested in the REET case. Both Parashar and Meena are private individuals. Both were posted at the Shiksha Sankul from where the REET question paper was leaked from the strong room. Meena was arrested on Wednesday after the police discovered that he had stolen one exam paper from an envelope at 8.30pm on September 24 and handed it over to another accused, Uda Ram Vishnoi, on September 25. Earlier in the day, police also visited the REET office inside the Rajasthan Board of Secondary Education (RBSE) complex in Ajmer to examine documents required for the investigation. Police sources said they have been trying to determine who authorised Meena for REET-related duties inside the Shiksha Sankul. Sacked RBSE chairman DP Jaroli had claimed that he only knew Parashar and did not know any other accused who were nabbed earlier by the police. Police claimed they have been examining the role of staff posted at the Shiksha Sankul to find out what happened on that day when Meena stole the paper. They will also check if someone had raised an alarm about the missing paper and the envelope which was tampered by Meena.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/reet-coordinatorparashar-arrestedin-paper-leak-case/articleshow/89231826.cms||---
---||Bhopal||HC frees woman who wed & converted||Ashutosh.Shukla Bhopal/Jabalpur: The Madhya Pradesh high court has ruled that no “moral policing” can be allowed when two adults decide to live together by way of marriage or a live-in relationship of their own will.With this, the bench of Justice Nandita Dubey rejected the argument of the counsel for the MP government that under the provisions of Freedom of Religion Act, 2021, conversion for the sake of marriage is not legal; and marriage so performed is legally null and void and the girl should be sent to Nari Niketan for ‘rehabilitation’.The decision came in response to a habeas corpus petition filed by Guljar Ahmed, who had married Hindu girl Arti Sahu, who converted to Islam but was then taken away by her parents to her hometown in Varanasi. Justice Dubey directed police to hand the woman back to the petitioner, as she wished, and see to it that they reach home safely and are not threatened thereafter by her parents.Guljar Khan had filed a habeas corpus petition, saying he and Arti had married in Maharashtra and she had willingly converted to Islam, but her parents had taken her away by force and have illegally detained her.On the orders of the judge, the 19-year-old woman was produced in court through video conferencing. In her statement, she told the court that she had willingly married Khan and converted to Islam. She said her parents and grandparents had forcibly taken her away, and that she was beaten up and threatened constantly to give a statement against her husband. She told the court that she wants to go with the petitioner as she has willingly married him.The court pointed out that the petitioner and his wife are adults. “No moral policing can be allowed in such matters where two major persons are willing to stay together whether by way of marriage or in a live-in relationship,” Justice Dubey said.Justice Dubey directed the government and police to hand over Arti to her husband and ensure they reach home safely. “The police authorities are also directed to see that in future, the corpus and petitioner are not threatened by the parents of the corpus,” the court said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/hc-frees-woman-who-wed-converted/articleshow/89231837.cms||---

During the current week, the average number of people penalized for not wearing a mask in public places dipped to less 500 per day in a city of almost two million people. Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC) levies penalties on people not wearing masks in public places or for not following Covid-appropriate behaviour. BMC penalized almost 1,200 people per day in the first and second week of this month. Bhopal averaged almost 2,000 cases new cases per day between January 23 to 29. Now, less than 500 have been penalized in 85 BMC wards in the duration. Amount coughed up by those found not wearing masks in public places was a mere Rs 2.6 lakh for the week. The penalty collected was almost Rs 8 lakh per week in the first three weeks of January. Average number of people penalized per day by the civic body was anywhere between 1,200 and 1,500 per day. When contacted, the civic body officials remained mum on the drop in penalties. According to government guidelines, children aged 12 years and over should wear a mask under the same conditions as adults. Ensuring hands are kept clean with soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub, while handling masks is also crucial to breaking the chain of transmission. BMC can also penalize for not maintaining social distancing and other Covid-19 protocols at public places.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/from-over-1k-to-less-than-500-in-15-days-mask-penalties-dip-even-as-cases-peak/articleshow/89231839.cms||Jamal Ayub

Neither the persons managing the liquor shops nor the customers are interested in making/taking the cash memo. The provision of compulsory cash memo to customers at the liquor shops was enacted on the recommendation of a SIT formed to check the sale of illicit liquor following a string of hooch tragedies in different parts of the state. The SIT contended that the liquor shops are selling liquor at rates more than the MRP, leading to people buying cheap liquor from persians dealing in sale of illicit liquor. But, this logic doesn’t seem to hold good for cities like Bhopal, where all the shops are with partners of a syndicate and they sell liquor of different brands at identical rates. “Once giving cash memos to customers was made compulsory by the excise department, for some days we were not giving cash memos because nobody was interested. The excise department had put a notice in the shops giving the name and mobile numberof its officer, who should be contacted if the cash memo is not given to a customer or the shopkeeper refuses to give it on demand. They got almost no calls. But, then they started surprise checking in shops and we started giving cash memos to customers, particularly during the day time when there is no crowd at the counter,” said a salesman at the counter of a liquor shop. Some days ago in the liquor shop at 10 no. stop market, two excise officials were taking pictures of cash memos being given to the customers and as it was being done, a man outside the shop was looking askance. He left the shop without purchasing any liquor.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/cash-memo-rule-at-liquor-shops-fails-to-go-down-well-with-tipplers/articleshow/89231841.cms||---

More than 50% of the deceased were aged above 60 years, the data shows. Youngest deceased was a five-day-old infant who had died in Gwalior district on January 20 while the eldest person to die due to Covid was a 97-year-old person in Ujjain district. Most of the patients who died of Covid-19 in the third wave till January 27 had one thing in common — all of them were co-morbid patients. Most of the deaths took place in second half of the month between January 16 and January 30 — when 69 deaths took place. Prior to this, only 14 deaths took place in the first 15 days of this month. Of the 53 deaths, 12 were women, the data shows. The total Case Fatality Rate (CFR) which is the ratio of total confirmed deaths to total Covid cases confirmed, has been far low compared to the previous waves, said sources. In the second wave, the CFR was above 0.50 and in the third wave it has been below 0.10 for most of the days. Sources said that the death rates has been lower in this wave compared to the previous wave and it could primarily be attributed to the fact that now majority of the population has been vaccinated now. Apart from vaccination, it is important to ensure that people strictly adhere to the Covid-19 appropriate behaviour specially in public places. It is only then that the third wave is likely to wane away, they said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/comorbidities-in-96-deaths-in-jan-50-were-above-60/articleshow/89231844.cms||Amarjeet Singh

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Boost in online tax revenue spurs corp to target 100 cr||Thiruvananthapuram: Spurred by the sudden rise in property tax collection, the civic body is targeting Rs 100 crore as collection this fiscal. Given the collection records in the past, the target seems like a pie in the sky for the civic body. However, the officials are being optimistic. The corporation has an annual demand of Rs 90 crore and collects 70-80% annually. The corporation secretary issued a circular to the revenue staff which lists down various on-going measures to attain the target of Rs 100 crore. The civic body has already started updating the list of tax defaulters on a monthly basis. Besides, action is being taken with regard to filing of statements in tax related legal cases which have been dragging on for years. One crucial step was taken in identifying all the mobile towers in the city and it was found that tax was collected from only 217 towers out of the total 431.The corporation has estimated that by levying tax on a retrospective effect up to four years, three times the tax amount can be collected from mobile towers. This is expected to yield the corporation an additional revenue of Rs 2.5 crore.The revenue wing of the city corporation has identified over 700 defaulters who owe corporation tax dues above Rs 1 lakh. The cumulative dues from these defaulters have been estimated at Rs 44 crore. In the past two months, the city corporation managed to collect around Rs 17 crore following the updation of tax database in all the wards. In 2020-21, the total demand of the city corporation in property tax was Rs 96.8 crore and the corporation could collect Rs 75.8 crores which is the highest collection of property tax since 2016-17. The corporation has not crossed Rs 70 crore in collection in the past five fiscals. The signs of significant hike in online payment of tax were evident from November 2021. The month had recorded a collection of Rs 9.75 crore which is more than double the amount the corporation had collected in the same month in 2020. Even while the corporation is aiming high with tax targets, government and central government buildings remain a major concern. As per the recent updated list published for each ward, government and central government buildings account for dues worth crores. Tax dues of two airport buildings since 2016-17 come around Rs 1.3 crore, according to the dues list published for Chackai ward. Tax dues of around 131 units of KSRTC bus terminal complex at Thampanoor go above Rs 1 crore. The main building of the government secretariat owes the corporation Rs 56 lakhs between 2016-17 and 2021-22. Ten other units under the government Secretariat also record dues around Rs 20 lakhs in the past five fiscals. Cash strapped Thiruvananthapuram Development Authority seems to top the tax defaulter list. TRIDA’s dues to the corporation for a single building in Palayam is Rs 1.58 crore. Around 295 units under TRIDA owe the corporation tax dues between Rs 10,000 - Rs 3 lakhs. Nearly 100 buildings owned by Thiruvananthapuram Development Authority owe the corporation tax dues well over Rs 10 lakhs as TRIDA is the top defaulter of tax dues as per the list made available for Medical College ward.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/boost-in-online-tax-revenue-spurs-corp-to-target-100-cr/articleshow/89231867.cms||Aswin J Kumar

He was instrumental in setting up the Covid brigade in the first and second wave at the time of former health minister K K Shailaja. He also played a key role in setting up the Medical College Hospital at Kasaragod for providing Covid care for the people in that district.The doctor has been removed citing various reasons. At first he was given a memo saying that he was not present during the visit made by health minister Veena George in October when she had reached the hospital at 10.30 pm.However, the doctor had given an explanation saying that he was present at the hospital on the occasion and someone had misled the minister on this. However, Dr Santosh Kumar received yet another notice citing supervisory lapses later.Meanwhile, a resident doctor attached to the ortho department was suspended for misbehaving with the bystanders of a patient. The video of this resident doctor shouting and using foul languages at the bystanders of the patient had become viral. Following this the authorities had sought a report from Dr Santosh Kumar on the incident.Based on his report, this resident doctor Ananthakirshnan was suspended from the service. Soon after the suspension a circular regarding the shifting of Dr Santosh Kumar from the deputy superintendent post also came out.It is learnt that the power struggle which is happening in the medical college hospitals after a change in the ministry in the second LDF government is the reason behind shifting the doctor.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/mch-deputy-supt-removed-from-post/articleshow/89231869.cms||---

While G Adarsh was representing the Indian Army, G Akash represented NCC Kerala-Lakshadweep directorate.Interestingly they have not met each other for the past one year and were only able to see each other during the practice session. This is the second time both of them appeared for the Republic Day parade. Adarsh had participated in the parade for the first time in 2016, which influenced Akash to follow his elder brother’s path and he appeared in the year 2017. This is the first time they attended the event together. Akash is one of the 100 NCC cadets from all over India who were selected for the parade.“When my brother shared his experiences after his first parade, I told him that we will do it together next time. I said that as a joke but it was a dream come true moment for us. We burst into tears out of happiness. We are from a farming family and our parents have also taught us farming. They have struggled a lot to give us a good education and all we wanted to do was to make them proud. I reached Delhi on December 18 for practice. Covid regulations were strictly followed as the participants were maintaining two hands distance from each other and also conducted regular Covid tests,” said Akash.“I was really happy when I came to know that my younger brother also got selected for the parade. It was his dream. Due to Covid restrictions, I was not able to meet him at the place where he stayed. I was really happy when I saw him performing on the ground,”said G Adarsh, Lance Naik in the Indian Army. Their parents are equally thrilled.“I consider this as a great gift from our children,” said their mother Bindhu. While their father Ganesh said that he had concerns about their future but now they have proved him wrong.“As we all know, the selection process of the Republic Day parade is not an easy task. Akash is a hardworking boy and that paid off well. He was the commander of the PM rally this year,” said Lt. Sunil Raj N V, NCC officer of Attingal Government College.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/brothers-attend-r-day-parade-together-for-the-first-time/articleshow/89231875.cms||---

The village lies on the outskirts of Ahmedabad.Local residents said that 300-400 members of a community have already left the village fearing a communal flare-up.Ten trustees manage the monument. Of the trustees, seven belong to ‘satpantis’ and the remaining three are the descendants of the family of Imamshah Bawa, after whom the dargah is named.Zainul Abidi, a former trustee, said the main intention of the seven trustees is to change the identity of the monument. “They claim this monument is of ‘Nishkalanki Maharaj’. But that is not true,” said Abidi. He said that the seven trustees are Kutchi Patels.Munir Saiyyed, an advocate and a member of the descendants’ family of Imamshah Bawa, said that the trust had issued a circular on January 24 calling for a meeting on January 25. “Being in the majority, they passed a resolution to construct the wall and immediately sought permission from the sub-divisional magistrate, who gave the permission on January 28,” said Saiyyed. He said that 300-400 people left the village after the action was taken by the trust.Saiyyed alleged that the trustees’ community affiliation made it easy for them to get the permission. “Earlier, the trust had erected a barbed wire fence around the dargah, separating it from the other parts which include the graveyard, Imambara, and a mosque,” said Saiyyed. He said that the wall constructed on Sunday is 12-15 feet high.Collector and district magistrate Sandip Sagale was not available for comment.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/pirana-shrine-gets-wall-tension-mounts/articleshow/89231876.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Male infertility gene: International research has city DNA||AHMEDABAD: When new studies put the infertility rate as high as 15% among some groups of Indian population, in more than 50% of the cases male infertility turned out to be the reason for difficulty in conceiving a child. The problem could be oligozoospermia (low sperm count), azoospermia (no sperm), asthenozoospermia (sperm’s inability to move), or a combination of multiple factors. An international study involving multiple cohorts indicated the role of a gene mutation for the phenomenon. One of the researchers was Dr Harsh Sheth, a genetic scientist from FRIGE’s Institute of Human Genetics in Ahmedabad. The study, ‘A de novo paradigm for male infertility’, was published recently in Nature Communications and has authors from the Netherlands, Germany, Australia, the UK, the US, and Spain among other countries. The study suggested that the mutation in gene RBM5 could be responsible for male infertility. “The study primarily took samples from males with infertility and both their parents,” said Sheth. “The genes get inherited from both mother and father, and we were interested to see how their genetic make-up is different from the one of male patients.” Sheth added: “For the purpose, whole exome sequencing was carried out where over 6 crore letter genetic code in each individual was read and studied.” He went on to say: “Eventually, what emerged were 29 de novo mutations. In general parlance, these were ‘new’ mutations not found in the pair of parents.” The gene RBM5 was isolated and studied. The experts associated it with the regulation of ‘male germ cell pre-mRNA splicing’ or the production of sperm in testes. To verify this theory, the scientists regulated the gene among mice and found that its mutation played the role of an inhibitor in sperm production. What are its implications? “It will help infertility experts diagnose the cause of infertility quickly,” said Sheth. “We are also running a cohort — the only one in India currently — where we are also checking for the presence of this specific mutation and are finding similar results.” Sheth added: “Couples can explore other ways such as sperm donation. Moreover, it will help prevent the carrying forward of the faulty gene if the child is conceived through methods such as the IVF.” Sheth went on to say that the results of genetic mutations are overall uniform in many countries. “It will give an answer to the question of what causes infertility in the first place,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/male-infertility-gene-intl-research-has-city-dna/articleshow/89231878.cms||Parth Shastri

Bharwad was shot dead in Dhandhuka town on January 25 by two motorcycle-borne men for sharing a controversial post on Islam and its religious figure on social media. Islami, according to the Gujarat ATS, was in touch with the two assassins“Maulana Qamar Ganhi Islami was arrested from Dariyagunj in Old Delhi while he was leaving his organization office, called Tehreek-e-Farogh-e-Islami,” said a senior ATS officer. The official added that Islami was earlier charged under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) by Tripura police in November 2021, following communal riots there. It was alleged that it was Islami’s provocative speeches that had led to the violence. “Islami had in April 2021 uploaded a video in which he was seen making provocative speeches against people who post blasphemous material on social media. In one of his speeches he said that one can go to any extent to punish a person who posts blasphemous statements against Islam,” said the ATS officer. Islami, according to the Gujarat ATS, was in touch with the two assassins — Shabbir Chopda, who had fired at Bharwad in Dhandhuka town, and Imtiyaz Pathan, who rode the motorcycle. Chopda followed Islami on social media and had also met him many times. ATS officials claim that Islami had supplied Chopda with the weapon and even helped him chalk out a plan for the murder. Meanwhile, two brothers — Azim Bashir Sama, a resident of Dudhsagar Road in Rajkot, and his brother Wasim — were also arrested by the Rajkot special operations group (SOG) for allegedly supplying the pistol and five cartridges to the Delhi cleric. Both brothers had escaped following Maulana’s arrest. However, Rajkot SOG sleuths nabbed Wasim from Morbi town and Azim from Mitana village of Tankara in Rajkot district. Both were handed over to the ATS for interrogation. Kishan Bharwad was shot dead on January 25. Following the incident, six people including Chopda, Shaikh, Jamalpur-based cleric Mohammed Ayyub Javrawala and two men from Morbi have been arrested in this case so far. Police officials claim that on January 9, an FIR was lodged against Bharwad for allegedly criticizing members of a particular religion and even sharing videos and photos of people being beheaded.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/cleric-had-supplied-weapon-says-ats/articleshow/89231879.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||CAQI predicts least and most polluted days accurately: Cept University study||AHMEDABAD: Just what is the best system to alert citizens to the air quality of their city? A new study led by researchers from Cept University has found that a composite air quality index (CAQI) based on fuzzy logic can predict the number of ‘good’ and very polluted days of a city. The researchers compared the National AQI (NAQI) for summer and winter seasons measured between 2019 and 2020 — 67 days and 83 days of air quality monitoring was conducted respectively. “In all, a total of 150 days, that is, 3,600 hours of monitoring data had been collected for these days,” claims the study by Dipsha Paresh Shah of faculty of technology, Cept university and Dr Piyushkumar Patel of VSITR, Kadi. For summer, the NAQI chart showed that 11.8%, 83.8%, and 4.4% of days are in good, satisfactory, and moderately polluted categories respectively. On the other hand, the CAQI chart for summer showed 92.6%, 5.9%, and 1.5% of days in good, satisfactory, and moderately polluted categories respectively. In winter, however, the NAQI chart showed 20.3% of days in the satisfactory category; 55.7% of days in the moderately polluted category; 10.1% days in the poor category and 13.9% days in the very poor category. During winters, 0% of days as per NAQI were in good and severe air quality category days. On the other hand, during winter, the CAQI chart showed that 6.3% of CAQI values were marked as ‘good’ category, 22.8% in satisfactory days category; 11.4% values in the moderately polluted days category, 40.5% of values in the poor days category, 13.9% of CAQI values in very poor days category and 5.1% values in severe days category. “The CAQI shows a realistic situation, especially when two or more pollutants are exceeding the national standards simultaneously. The composite air quality indexing tool is very useful in protecting the well-being of humans in urban areas,” claimed the Cept study.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/caqi-predicts-least-and-most-polluted-days-accurately-study/articleshow/89231884.cms||---

On average, about 60% of the patients requiring hospitalization were not fully vaccinated, said experts. The ratio was slightly higher in government hospitals, whereas in private hospitals the ratio was about 30-40%, they added. In government-run hospitals in Ahmedabad, 70% and 75% of the patients on ventilators and BiPAP machines were not fully vaccinated. The majority were above 50 and were long due for jabs. In Surat, of the 87 patients needing oxygen or ventilator support, 27 were unvaccinated and 19 were partially vaccinated. While the vaccination status for 11 was not known, only 30 were fully vaccinated. Dr Ranjan Aiyer, the medical superintendent of the state-run SSG Hospital in Vadodara, said that over 50% of the Covid patients were not fully vaccinated. “Out of the 50%, half had taken no vaccination at all. Fortunately, the majority have mild illnesses,” he said. Rajkot doctors said that about 50% of the Covid patients at government hospitals are unvaccinated or partially vaccinated. Dr Praful Kamani, the president of Rajkot Medical Association, said: “About 30% of the patients in private hospitals are unvaccinated or partially vaccinated.” There are currently 80 patients at PDU government hospital. Dr R S Trivedi, the medical superintendent of the hospital, said that most patients requiring oxygen or ventilator support are unvaccinated.

On average, about 60% of the patients requiring hospitalization were not fully vaccinated, said experts. The ratio was slightly higher in government hospitals, whereas in private hospitals the ratio was about 30-40%, they added. In government-run hospitals in Ahmedabad, 70% and 75% of the patients on ventilators and BiPAP machines were not fully vaccinated. The majority were above 50 and were long due for jabs. In Surat, of the 87 patients needing oxygen or ventilator support, 27 were unvaccinated and 19 were partially vaccinated.

Shah said that the Centre’s schemes such as Make in India, Atmanirbhar Bharat, and Vocal for Local are the new definitions of the Swadeshi movement propagated by Mahatma Gandhi. Shah unveiled a mural of the Mahatma at the Sabarmati riverfront on the occasion of Martyrs’ Day. “Mahatma Gandhi not just fought for India’s freedom, but also offered many ways to rebuild the country after it had achieved freedom,” Shah said. “He advocated Swadeshi, Satyagraha, swabhasha, sadhan shuddhi, aparigraha (non-possessiveness), prayer, fasting, and simplicity.” Shah said Mahatma Gandhi instilled these ideas in the consciousness of the citizens while fighting against the British so as to make the ideas the base for the country’s reconstruction after it achieved freedom. “Without a doubt, Mahatma Gandhi was the greatest person to have lived in the past millennium anywhere in the world,” Shah said in his address. “Unfortunately, while homage was paid to the photos of Bapu and he found mention in speeches, for many years khadi, handicrafts, swabhasha, and Swadeshi were forgotten,” Shah said. “After becoming the Prime Minister, Narendra Modi gave a new lease of life to all these ideas of Bapu.” Shah said that the new education policy lays emphasis on swabhasha. He said the policy will give due importance to Indian languages because if India is detached from its languages, it will get separated from its culture, history, literature, and grammar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/mahatma-is-millenniums-greatest/articleshow/89231899.cms||---

Jagdish Patel, 39, Vaishali Patel, 37, and their children Vihangi, 11, and Dharmik, 3, died from exposure to the frigid cold on January 19 while they were attempting to cross into the US by foot. Dilip Patel, a resident of Illinois and the cousin of Jagdish Patel, started the online fundraiser on Saturday. As of Sunday evening, the fundraising – that aims to raise about US $ 70,000 (about Rs 52.5 lakh) – had already received US $ 67,000 (Rs 50.3 lakh) from 510 donors. Sources close to the development said that the bodies of the four members of Patel family are likely to be cremated in Canada this week. Apart from Dilip Patel, another cousin of Jagdish Patel, who lives in Pennsylvania, is in charge of the last rites. They added that a visa has also been sought for at least one member from Dingucha to attend the funeral. “We have to stand with their family in this tragedy time with supporting of the small contributions with finance and prayers. The pain for the family cannot be imagined. There are no words to pay tribute. The cycle of birth and death is in the god hands but we could only support and stand with this family in their painful time and it would be appreciated by God with every little contribution and support done by individuals [sic],” mentions the message on the fundraising website, adding that the funds raised would go towards funeral and other expenses, and the rest would go to Patel’s family in India. “The Indian consulate and the Canadian government have already extended all support to the kin of the deceased, including assistance in arrangements for the funeral. The Gujarati community in Manitoba is also doing its bit to help in any way,” said a Gujarati community member. The investigation into the tragedy has pointed at human trafficking; the Canadian police are probing the incident while creating awareness among the Indian community to prevent such mishaps in the future.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/relatives-turn-to-crowdfunding-for-funeral/articleshow/89231900.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Medical students threaten to boycott OPDs from February 1||AHMEDABAD: The protest at BJ Medical College and Civil Hospital against Dr Kamlesh Upadhyay, professor and head of the department (HoD) of medicine, for the alleged “ill-treatment” meted out to final-year MBBS students, entered its nineteenth day on Sunday. The students have now threatened to boycott Out Patient Department (OPD) duties from February 1. But they will serve in the emergency and attend to Covid patients, they said. The protest intensified on Sunday after students and the JDA alleged that Dr Upadhyay has threatened to “fail students if protests are not withdrawn.” The medical students have even raised their ante against the state-appointed two-member committee investigating the matter, alleging partisan attitude. They further alleged that Dr Upadhyay was influencing the probe since he is treating a close family member of a senior IAS official in the health department. Last month, the Junior Doctors’ Association (JDA) of BJ Medical College and Civil Hospital had approached the anti-ragging committee of the college, seeking action against Dr Upadhyay. “Dr Upadhyay had been adamant in not sending the internal marks of undergraduate students to Gujarat University (GU) and it was after a string of sit-out protests that the department had sent the marks on January 24. Why is Dr Upadhayay playing with our careers?” questioned JDA president Oman Prajapati. The JDA in its petition has also alleged that since the pandemic Dr Upadhyay had been avoiding Covid duties and that even his elevation as HoD of medicine was being internally challenged as he was only the fifth senior among other eligible doctors for that post. “We feel that an impartial inquiry against an individual like Dr Upadhyay, who wields such influence, is a distant possibility. It is this lack of faith that led us all to embark on this protest,” says Prajapati. The JDA has also claimed that Dr Upadhyay had threatened postgraduate and undergraduate medical students, telling them that he would not send their marks to GU if ward duties were not adhered to. “How can students who are attending to Covid patients be asked to visit other wards during the first, second and the third wave? Is that not putting other patients at risk of an infection,” asks Prajapati.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/medical-students-threaten-to-boycott-opds-from-february-1/articleshow/89231901.cms||---

He was the guest of honour at Indian Institute of Management-Visakhapatnam’s two-day flagship annual business conclave ‘Vriddhi’ which concluded on Sunday. Speaking on the topic of ‘the role of infrastructure development for realising India’s five-trillion-dollar economy goal’, Gadkari explained the Union government’s vision for the promotion of integrated infrastructure under PM Gati Shakti national plan. “The thrust is on development of road infrastructure as well as allied highway initiatives like multi-modal logistic parks and other infrastructure development. These different corridors, smart and intelligent transportation system and robust infrastructure will change the face of the country and also supercharge the economy to a five trillion-dollar economy,” said Gadkari.“The Centre is expeditiously working towards development of a national highway network of 2 lakh kilometres by 2025. The Visakhapatnam-Raipur Greenfield road corridor is being developed in AP. Four to five packages for this road were already awarded. This would really become a growth highway for all the three states of AP, Odisha and Chhattisgarh. Besides cutting travel time, it would also spur socio-economic development in the region. As many as 35 multi model logistics parks will be developed across the country, including one each in Anantapur and Visakhapatnam in AP,” said Gadkari.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/centre-is-spending-2l-cr-on-ap-says-highways-minister-gadkari/articleshow/89231902.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

According to the projections made by the Union government, there are 24.41 lakh teenagers in this category. The state administered the first dose to 24.44 lakh people in this population cohort by 5 pm on Sunday. Only a few states in the country achieved this feat. Vaccination for this category was rolled out on January 3. The national coverage in this age group currently stands at around 60%. Only ‘Covaxin’ is being administered to the 15-18 age group. As the gap is only 28 days between the two doses of Covaxin, the second dose would be given starting from February 1. Meanwhile, Andhra Pradesh crossed the 8 crore Covid-19 vaccine dose milestone on Sunday. First dose has been given to about 4.28 crore people, including the 15-18 category. According to the revised estimates of the Union health ministry, there are about 3.95 crore eligible beneficiaries in the 18-plus age group. The state already achieved 100% first dose vaccine coverage. About 3.64 crore people have been fully immunised against the pandemic, translating to 92% second dose coverage. Precaution/booster dose has so far been given to 8.39 lakh people. The state started giving the booster doses from January 10. Andhra Pradesh has an estimated 29.42 lakh people falling into the co-morbid 60-plus population category. The number of healthcare workers/frontline respondents stands at around 20.5 lakh people. But with regards to the administration of the precautionary dose, 9 months (39 weeks) must have elapsed since the administration of the second dose to make the beneficiary eligible. As per the estimates, about 19.45 people would become eligible for the booster doses in the first quarter, i.e. till the end of March. Increased vaccination coverage is said to be one of the reasons for somewhat milder cases surfacing in Covid-19 patients in the ongoing third wave.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/first-dose-vax-covers-all-in-15-18-age-group/articleshow/89231909.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Hubballi||In Vijayapura, a diploma holder comes up with new irrigation device||Vijayapura: In arid North Karnataka, economy in use of water for agriculture is a skill greatly valued in a farmer. Efficient irrigation systems, which ensure value for each drop of water, can find few regions more suitable for an experimental run, and one such device that achieves near-complete utilisation of water has been developed by Jayashri Pattanashetti of Vijayapura district. A diploma holder, Jayashri endeavoured to come up with a device that simplifies the sub-surface irrigation system in the wake of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s pithy exhortation to farmers – ‘Per Drop, More Crop’. “The device ensures complete utilisation of water, and is superior in this regard to every other existing sub-surface irrigation system. The device is nearly 10-12 inches in length, and comprises two parts – the upper part is cylinder-shaped, with a diameter of 1.5 inches, and extending up to eight inches in length. It is fit with tubes. While the upper tube is connected to a conventional drip line above the surface, the second tube performs the function of an air ventilator. The other entity of this device is a perforated funnel-shaped object, at the bottom of the cylinder. Once connected to the drip line, nearly half the length of the device is buried beneath the ground. Water from the drip line flows into the tubes of the device, and irrigates the soil,” Jayashri told TOI. Furthermore, the device is designed to alert farmers in the event of blockage in the funnel’s holes. “In such a scenario, the device gets filled with water to the brim, and gushes out through the air vent, alerting the farmer on the field. All the farmer has to do in such a situation is to lift the device, and rectify the connection to ensure water continues to be supplied without any interruption,” said Jayashri, adding that making the metallic device cost her Rs 500. “If it is made using PVC pipe plastic, it will last longer, while the cost of production will come down to Rs 40,” she added. Jayashri’s father MB Pattanashetti, a retired lecturer who taught mechanical engineering, said, “When she pitched the idea to me, I took her to a mechanic, who prepared this device.” The device was tested at Basavanabagewadi-based farmer Abdul Ragati’s grape farm. “The system is more flexible compared to the existing ones, since there is little wastage of water, time and energy,” Abdul said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/in-vijayapura-a-diploma-holder-comes-up-with-new-irrigation-device/articleshow/89229783.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai
---||Hubballi||In Hubballi-Dharwad, collection of waste at doorstep remains on paper||Hubballi: Although the Hubballi Dharwad Municipal Corporation (HDMC) is said to be collecting garbage from the doorstep of citizens since 2018, complaints have surfaced about pourakarmikas scanning the GPS machine at collection points, without collecting the garbage. This has now led to the public demanding GPS enabled vehicles for garbage collection across the twin cities. Several citizens have caught the civic workers scanning the GPS machine before the arrival of the vehicle. They say that the pourakarmikas have been instructed by their contractor to do so. Dr C G Zalaki, a resident in Lingaraj Nagar, told TOI that he has observed such scanning by pourakarmikas several times. “When I caught them red-handed, they said the vehicle will arrive later, but it did not make it on that day. So, we have requested HDMC authorities to deploy GPS-enabled vehicles. But they are turning a deaf ear to our requests,” he added. Harshavardhan Sheelavant, an environmentalist in Dharwad, shared that one such incident — a pourakarmika scanning the machine before the arrival of the vehicle — was grabbed by a CCTV camera at Manjunathapura in Malamaddi, Dharwad. “When a worker scanned the machine at 8am and the vehicle failed to arrive, we raised a complaint on social media. Subsequently, the vehicle arrived by 11.45 am. Civic workers said that they were pushed on duty at a supermarket where DC and HDMC commissioner were on rounds on January 25. Earlier, we had complained about this issue to HDMC, but the staff had ruled out our grievance claiming that the vehicle had collected the garbage in our area,” he explained. Mahesh Gadag, a faculty at private college in Vidyanagar, Hubballi, said the pourakarmikas are taking advantage of the busy schedules of citizens. “When both husband and wife work, they can’t wait for garbage collection vehicle to arrive every morning. As they don’t arrive at a specific time, we keep our bins out and go to work. When we return, garbage remains there. Meanwhile, HDMC records garbage collection from our area despite not collecting the same. Some workers also say they have small vehicles and that they are already full, and that they will return next day. In some places, they collect garbage on alternative days and they openly say they are instructed to do so by their contractor,” he added. HDMC commissioner Dr Gopal Krishna B said that he is unaware of such incidents. “We will verify the facts from our control room and issue show-cause notice to the contractors/ staff concerned. If allegations are proved, we will take appropriate action against them. Meanwhile, we request public to file their grievance with control room,” he appealed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/in-hubballi-dharwad-collection-of-waste-at-doorstep-remains-on-paper/articleshow/89229700.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

Vasudevan was born in Tindivanam, where his father was a teacher and mother a homemaker. He and his four brothers moved to Chennai when their father lost his job after anti-Hindi agitations broke out in the 1960s. His father got a Sanskrit teacher’s job at Kendriya Vidyalaya, IIT Madras. There, middle-schooler Vasu faced his first challenge -- shifting to an English medium school – and had to repeat sixth standard. "If English was a challenge, Hindi was a nightmare," he says. He completed a BSc in physics and a BL degree from the Madras Law College. With no flair for physics, he followed the advice of his older brother (who was studying CA) and decided on the company secretary course. "Learning company law felt like my calling," he recalls. He also learned typing and shorthand. "These skills gave me an edge in the early days of my career. My top speed was 120 words per minute," he says. His first job was as a stenographer, in 1984. His salary, `250 a month. After a failed attempt, he cleared the ACS intermediary (level 2) exam in 1985, which was followed by a one-year management training course in Cholamandalam Finance. "Word spread about my typing and shorthand skills and every department head in the Chola Group wanted my help. Soon, I was in charge of recording the minutes of board meetings of the NBFC and learned to draft a resolution and preamble," says  Vasudevan.In 1987, Vasudevan passed the ACS exam ranked third all India. He was recruited as assistant company secretary by M Anandan, who headed Chola Finance back then. He became company secretary and legal manager in two years. In 1991, Vasudevan headed the first-ever vehicle finance vertical of Chola Finance and led the business till 2005. He left Chola after it entered into a JV with DBS Singapore. He moved to Mumbai to join DCB Bank but quit and returned to Chennai in two years. At that point he was 43 years old and did not have a job. In 2008, Vasudevan decided to enter the micro-lending business in Tamil Nadu. Within months, Equitas Micro Finance India was started with a corpus of `10 crore with three others, including his mentor and ex-boss Anandan. "I pledged my house in Anna Nagar to pool in my share of `2.5 crore," says Vasudevan. Equitas faced its biggest challenge in 2010 when Andhra Pradesh banned all micro finance lending businesses because of the industry’s harsh collection practices. Nevertheless, in 2011, Equitas expanded into commercial vehicle and small finance lending segments. In 2016, it became a bank. Four years later, on November 2, 2020, the bank made its stock market debut. Challenges remain. "Most borrowers are tea stall owners, who were heavily impacted during multiple lockdown," he says. "Our CASA growth is exceptional too, from opening 10,000 accounts a month to 1.5 lakh accounts post pandemic. And 90% are first time borrowers, reflecting our objective of financial inclusion." In 2008, Equitas Trust was formed, which receives 5% of the bank’s net profit every quarter to spend on CSR programmes. The trust currently runs eight English-medium schools for children from low income households. A 100-bed hospital is being built at Selaiyur in Chennai. In his personal capacity, Vasudevan also runs a government-approved adoption centre "Varshini Illam Trust", named after his daughter, in Anna Nagar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/every-4th-borrower-in-chennai-is-his-customer/articleshow/89230088.cms||Mamtha Asokan

And it has decided to rope in industry to help train people to do the jobs on offer, now and in the future. "Our chief minister’s vision is to make Tamil Nadu, the skill capital of India. The skill development mission must be tuned to what industry needs," says J Innocent Divya, managing director of the Tamil Nadu Skill Development Corporation (TNSDC ). So TNSDC is getting industries that have their own training institutes on board through the ‘green channel’ route. They won’t have to go through the lengthy process of empanelment required for a training partner. "We are granting them easy access and all their programmes will come under the banner of TNSDC. We will provide funds and ensure that even rural youth undergo such training to land good jobs," says Divya. "So far, more than 10 corporates have expressed their intent to collaborate with TNSDC." In the short term, TNSDC has asked all districts to identify at least one lead sector -- like apparel for Tirupur and Coimbatore and electronics for Hosur (Krishnagiri) – on which they can concentrate. The long-term approach could be the skill gap study being initiated in every district. "It will be a study based on the industrial climate in the state, the corridors that are coming up, and the need of the industries – not just the major ones but also small and micro units. We are not going to work in isolation, but in tandem with industry," says Divya. TNSDC also plans to create at least 10 centres of excellence (CoEs) for specific sectors over the next financial year. It will leverage the experience and technology of the skill councils of 36 different sectors that have a big presence in the state. "Talent and skills increasingly defining the identity of a company, state or nation. Just like Israel is synonymous with cybersecurity and Germany with engineering, states and nations are investing heavily in chosen areas to drive excellence at scale and increase economic and social value. It is heartening to see the Tamil Nadu government identify a few areas of focus and allow industry to take the lead in skilling and upskilling the vast talent in the state. Industry leaders are best positioned to curate and deliver programmes are relevant to the rapidly changing landscape and aligned to the future of work," says Ramkumar Ramamoorthy, former CMD, Cognizant India, and pro-vice-chancellor, Krea University. Basically, TNSDC is focused on three areas. First is training all unemployed rural youth. They may be semi-skilled, totally unskilled or might not have had a formal education. TNSDC will train them in different skills and get them employment. It will designate certain sectors and job roles for such rural youth. The next focus will be on students – in schools and colleges – who have formal education, but never underwent any vocational training. When they look for jobs, their skills are not tuned to the requirements of industry. The idea is to groom them in a particular field to suit the needs of that industry. Vocationalising the curriculum will be a major focus for TNSDC. The concept will be of a finishing school, which can be partially or fully subsidized. The idea is to increase the employability of a college student. The third level will be to upskill existing professionals. TNSDC is trying to collaborate with universities across the globe for this. It has taken the public private partnership (PPP) route to establish apex skill development centres with private partners in BFSI, construction, healthcare, logistics and automobiles. "The next phase will be to ensure that entrepreneurship is built into this model, so that youngsters not only look for a placement, but eventually become entrepreneurs and offer jobs for others," says Divya. But that is an evolving story of the future to be built on skilling||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/skilling-on-their-mind/articleshow/89230106.cms||D Govardan

NDMC vice-chairman Satish Upadhyay informed that the project has been taken up by the council in association with Sahitya Kala Parishad.  “At the camp, 12 artisans will carve out 12 black marble stone sculptures. These will later be displayed at different locations and roundabouts to enhance their aesthetics. The project was taken up to mark 75 years of Independence and celebrate Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav,” said Upadhyay. These six to eight feet tall sculptures will be made by renowned artisans. “These would be based on Indian culture, heritage and different subjects to showcase progressive India and the glorious history of its people, culture and achievements. These artisans can also showcase different forms in life, most often human figures, but also inanimate objects through their work. Besides promoting art, the initiative will also help in the landscaping of sites with heavy public footfall,” said Upadhyay. He added that the Sahitya Kala Parishad will not only arrange sculpture artists for the camp, but also contribute in procurement of stones and tools, payment to curator, coordinators, etc.TNN||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/sculptures-to-come-up-in-12-ndmc-areas/articleshow/89229972.cms||TNN

The civic authorities have stopped pig catching drives for the past few days, which has resulted in a rise in pigs seen roaming in the city. Gokul Road, Old Hubballi, Keshwapur, Gopankoppa, Bhavani Nagar, Ashok Nagar, Heggeri and other areas have turned into a haven for pigs. Dr Ravi Saligoudar, of veterinary department in HDMC, said the professional pig catchers are reluctant to carry on drives in Hubballi-Dharwad. “In the recent few weeks, the pig catchers could not get sufficient pigs to catch as the news about the drive was leaked. Hence, pig catchers are not showing interest to conduct drives,” he added. He said some catchers are not showing interest due to fear of attack by the pig owners. “We are getting suitable support from police, but due to the hectic work of Covid norm enforcement and other works police are too busy,” he added. Najeer Honyal, corporator from ward No 71, said HDMC officials must start pig catching drives. In residential areas too, pig numbers are increasing because of the negligence of officials, he said. Mohan C, a social activist, said the pig menace is more nowadays in Hubballi city mainly on Gokul Road, Vikas Nagar and other areas. Officials should act to curb this menace, he added. Dr Saligoudar said that based on the complaints received at the control room, HDMC is initiating action, adding that he will soon bring the problem of pigs catchers to the notice of the commissioner. After discussing with him a decision will be taken on resuming pig catching drives, he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/hdmc-fails-to-check-pig-menace-in-twin-cities/articleshow/89229838.cms||J Abbas Mulla

You are in fact, part of a burgeoning band of takers for plant-based protein, a number projected to grow globally to $30.9 billion by 2026 with a compound annual growth rate of 15% (according to market analyst Statista). In India, the alt-meat trade is about $30 million, largely driven by packaged food, says a 2021 study by retail broking company Nirmal Bang, which also predicts the market size will touch $500 million by 2025. Olympic gold medallist Neeraj Chopra is already a brand ambassador for a company that makes vegetarian meat, several Bollywooders have hopped on to the green protein train, even ITC recently loaded up on "meat analogues". At ground level, Dhaval Chandarana, owner of the two-month-old Chennai-based Café 28, advertised as the "first vegan food court in the country", says around 40% of his customers head straight to the mock-meat shawarma and pizza counters. "I turned vegan a while ago, so I know how meat tastes, and these mock meats, made from jackfruit and soy, have a similar texture. That’s the reason former meat-eaters like me are drawn to it," says Chandarana. "Our surveys, as well as those from the Good Food Institute, indicate that 50% urban Indians want to switch over to plant-based meats," says Unnikrishnan P G, CEO and founder of Kochi-based The Green Meat. "Our target group are the flexitarians, the vegetarian who enjoys animal products. A lot of them want to cut down for health reasons, but can’t get themselves to unless they have good enough substitutes," says Unnikrishnan. "Most mock meats use soya, but now newer varieties are coming that make use of pulse proteins such as green peas, chickpea and horse gram. These give both texture and taste, but with zero cholesterol," he adds. The no-cholesterol factor seems to be among the main reasons for the increasing popularity of mock meats. Jackfruit for instance offers up 2g protein per 100g serving of 93 calories, and soyabean gives 45g protein at 33 calories. A 100g of chicken though has 30 grams of protein but offers it up in 165 calories and with 150mg of cholesterol. For the last two years, whole food plant-based nutritionist Madhura Vayal has been running a cloud kitchen offering plant-based meals. Of late, her mock meat dishes have been gathering steam. "Many have transitioned to a plant-based diet, but want the flavours of typical meat dishes. So we started making butter chicken and biriyani with alt-meat," says the Mumbai-based nutritionist. "Plant-based meats don’t contain cholesterol, but in the end, it is a processed product, so I wouldn’t call them 100% healthy. Most mock meats are made of processed soya or wheat-based gluten (seitan). I prefer natural vegetable substitutes like yam or aubergine for fish, and jackfruit for mutton as these are healthier." Though 70% of Indians are non-vegetarian, more than 60% eat meat only once or twice a week or month, says Vegolution India founder-CEO Siddharth Ramasubramanian, who recently launched Hello Tempayy in Chennai. "Most non-vegetarians are eating vegetarian food most of the time." In the west, says Ramasubramanian, the average meat consumption per person per year is 75-100 kg, while in India it is 5, whether for affordability or religious reasons. "So, meat-eaters here too are looking for clean processed non-meat protein options like their vegetarian counterparts. And that opens up a huge market," he says. Tempeh, the fermented soy product his company manufactures, offers 19g of protein for every 100g. Nutritionist Ryan Fernando says that so far the feedback on mock meats is that the flavours and textures still haven’t "transcended" to anywhere near the real thing. "But you have to remember that India is such a large country. Even if you have.1 % adopting mock meats, you are already at a million and it’s become a trend," says the founder of Qua Nutrition.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/waiter-theres-a-pea-in-my-steak-veg-proteins-make-food-market-sizzle/articleshow/89230154.cms||---
---||Business||Govt may set up fund to support R&D, innovation||Mumbai: There is renewed hope of an innovation and R&D fund being finally announced in the Budget this year — a move which will benefit a cross-section of Indian industry, including pharma, IT and manufacturing. The coronavirus pandemic has stressed the need for innovation more than ever before. Over the last few months, there have been discussions between the department of pharma and industry bodies over R&D incentives, with the government readying a draft on the issue. There is speculation about a targeted fund for strengthening knowledge-driven sectors like pharma & IT, and restoring tax benefits on R&D undertaken by companies, being in the works, industry experts told TOI. Over the last few years, there has been talk about an R&D fund being announced for innovation-driven sectors including pharmaceuticals, but it didn’t see the light of day. The draft R&D policy finalised by the government highlights funding for innovation for pharma and medtech, strengthening the R&D infrastructure (creation of innovation hubs like Singapore, Boston & San Francisco), and industry-academic collaboration. “India, being the pharmacy of the developing world, now needs to move up the value chain. Innovation should be supported as this is going to be fundamental for the healthcare industry,” Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance’s secretary general Sudarshan Jain said. Besides restoring the weighted average tax deduction of 200% on R&D spends, companies setting up innovation hubs should get tax sops, an industry executive said. Tech driven-innovative healthcare solutions have played a pivotal role in fighting the Covid crisis. This year’s Budget should focus on encouraging these solutions by way of tax benefit/ tax holidays and even establishing a healthcare innovation fund, according to Alok Roy, chair of Ficci Health Services Committee and chairman of Medica Group of Hospitals. The pandemic has also necessitated the need for a more self-reliant India. The government should protect the domestic manufacturing base by increasing customs duty on import of medical devices to at least 15% from the existing 0-7.5%. Due to low custom duty, India is importing Rs 46,000-crore medical devices, and is over 80% import-dependent, Association of Indian Medical Device Industry’s forum coordinator Rajiv Nath said. For the Indian medtech sector to be viable and sustaining, there has to be a waiver of the duty and cess, releasing sectoral payment dues, to free up the working capital for investments in critical spare and lifesaving equipment. Healthcare funding through subsidised loans, especially in tier-2 & -3 cities need to be provided to reactivate the healthcare infrastructure sector, which will further boost other supporting industries, Roy added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/govt-may-set-up-fund-to-support-rd-innovation/articleshow/89230374.cms||Rupali Mukherjee

Top names in the business like JCB, Volvo CE and Schwing Stetter are either already working on electric versions of some of their big yellow machines or conducting feasibility studies for the launch of select global e-applications in India. “The construction equipment industry is seriously looking at electric mobility options, particularly for applications where we can pack a viable battery size,” said Dimitrov Krishnan, MD of Volvo CE India & president of the Indian Construction Equipment Manufacturers’ Association (ICEMA). Volvo, he said, has five electric models it has just launched globally — 3 excavators and 2 loaders. These are available in Europe and US and already 300 machines have been delivered. “We will launch them in India too and we are currently evaluating options,” said Krishnan. “Because of the higher cost, we will have to find a business model that is viable,” he added. Others like Schwing Stetter India are looking for specific areas where electric mobility solutions can be used. “A 100-horsepower engine product that works inside tunnels used for metro, road or hydro power projects can use e-versions effectively because it will cut out exhaust fumes. We are attempting to convert applications like these to electric versions,” said V G Sakthikumar, MD of Schwing Stetter India. With lithium ion battery production being localised, both by Indian as well as MNC players, sourcing battery is no longer an issue, he added. Indeed, the construction equipment industry’s baby steps into e-mobility is also an opportunity for local battery makers. Take Nexcharge, a joint venture between Exide and Swiss lithium ion battery maker Leclanche, which is already working with companies on e-applications. “Earth moving and off-highway equipment makers are opting for lithium ion battery-powered forklifts, excavators, etc, and a number of OEMs are working with us to electrify construction equipment machines. We are working with JCB, for instance, though the numbers are still small,” said Mehul Shah, VP (transport BU) at Nexcharge. Construction equipment companies say the EV entry will be with smaller HP engine machines, otherwise the cost variable will not work. “A truck mixture which costs Rs 35 lakh will cost 6 times more in electric variant and will not be viable,” said Sakthikumar. For the math to work, smaller engines will move to electric variants. The construction industry sold 93,000 units in calendar 2021, up from 75,500 units in 2020 but short of its peak sales of 98,000 in 2018.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/construction-equipment-makers-plan-to-go-electric/articleshow/89230143.cms||Nandini Sen Gupta

This could still have implications for the fiscal deficit. But the government also has the headroom to contain the deficit’s impact by holding back on some of the spendings. According to Axis Bank’s chief economist Saugata Bhattacharya, the large cash balance with the government will be the key calibrating instrument to alleviate market borrowing pressure. He added that tax flows in the fourth quarter are also expected to be robust, which will improve the government’s cash position. As a result, the Centre will not have to look out for new means to fund the deficit even if the LIC IPO were not factored in. As of now the government continues to target an IPO this fiscal. It is widely expected that the LIC IPO would raise over Rs 75,000 crore and contribute significantly to government revenues. However, the Omicron wave and the crash in prices of stocks listed recently have thrown up challenges. Bhattacharya said, even though the LIC IPO appears to be a bit of a touch-and-go, the government can yet stick to the fiscal deficit target by shifting some spending, or curtailing expenditure. Without the IPO, he expects the slippage to be small at around 6.5% as against the 6.4% that Axis Bank has estimated. According to HSBC’s chief economist Pranjul Bhandari, the cash balance could be used to ease pressure on bond markets, given expectations of a large government borrowing in FY23. The other measures she highlights are the push to bond inclusion in global indices and developing a retail debt market. The pressure on interest rates is also expected to emerge from policy normalisation with tightening taking place immediately after the Budget in RBI’s February policy or during the next financial year in April 2022. Bhandari pointed out that, with the global rise in oil and fertiliser prices, upside risks to food inflation are also there and the time is ripe for a 20bps (100 basis points = 1 percentage point) reverse repo rate hike in the February 9 meeting. SBI’s chief economist Soumya Kanti Ghosh has forecast a fiscal deficit of 6-6.5% for the next financial year (FY23). “If disinvestment of LIC passes through in FY22, the government might be ending the fiscal with a large cash balance of Rs 3 lakh crore. This can come handy in supporting a large part of government fiscal deficit without taking recourse to market borrowings,” Ghosh said in a recent note. Sonal Varma of Nomura Securities expects the government to stay within its 6.8% GDP deficit target set out in the FY22 Budget, with higher tax revenue collections balanced by more spending and a disinvestment shortfall. “Owing to the government’s general reticence thus far in announcing stimulus measures during previous lockdowns, we do not expect the third wave to elicit much of a fiscal response for now,” she said in a report.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rs-1l-cr-kitty-cuts-need-for-lic-ipo-in-budget/articleshow/89230418.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Business||Legal experts split over crypto regulation||MUMBAI: Legal experts are divided over regulating crypto assets. While one section is advising the government not to take a hasty decision without understanding the use cases, the other is against continuing the status quo despite the difficulty in defining crypto. ICICI Bank’s group general counsel Pramod Rao has said, “The government’s pause (on introducing the crypto bill in Parliament) is a good thing for us to wait and watch, and decide whether we need a separate regulator, which can transcend into all use cases.” However, Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas partner Anu Tiwari said that it will take a few years for a new regulator to attain maturity — which is too long a time for crypto. According to Tiwari, Sebi is the practical choice for regulating crypto despite challenges like identifying issuers of tokens. The legal experts were speaking in a webinar organised by Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy on Saturday. According to Rao, regulation is aimed at having transparent rules that are commonly applied. One cannot expect regulation to be a safety net for investors. Rao said it is incumbent on the domestic crypto industry to keep enhancing the level of disclosures. Rao also said that in the case of regulation, the application of several existing laws will have to be considered. “Crypto trading may already be contravening the exchange control norms under FEMA (Foreign Exchange Management Act),” he said. Sriram Chakravarthi, partner at Singapore-based law firm Rajah & Tann, too said the status quo cannot continue. “It is better to have a process of constant evolution, consultation and then come up with guidelines, etc, and looking at how they work rather than the wait-and-watch approach,” said. Rao said that Sebi was more aligned to regulate the category of stablecoins — cryptocurrencies linked to an underlying asset like gold or dollar. Crypto is generated by automated algorithms. “Is the developer — the algorithm’s creator — the one you want to hold responsible? What if they are not situated in India?” Rao asked.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/legal-experts-split-over-crypto-regulation/articleshow/89230329.cms||Aseem Gujar

The move came after Indian fund houses together reached the Sebi-imposed $7-billion overall limit for such investments. Some of the fund houses have already restricted inflows into schemes that invest abroad. Industry players, however, said that there are enough indications that the issue would soon be resolved, unless the RBI is unwilling to let Indians invest abroad through this route. According to A Balasubramanian, chairman of the MF industry trade body Amfi, it is understood that the government has increased this limit to $15 billion. This may get notified soon, both by the government and the RBI. “Once it is notified, it will be business as usual. Hence, one has to wait for the clarity on this issue,” Balasubramanian, who’s also the MD & CEO of Aditya Birla MF, said. According to an industry source, last week Sebi inspected the total investment positions of MFs in overseas assets and found that the limit was fully utilised. Subsequently, it asked fund houses to restrict incremental investments abroad, which led to the Amfi directive. The $7-billion limit was set in June 2021 with the individual fund house limit set at $1 billion. Sources further said that the government has already proposed to more than double the $7-billion limit to $15 billion, but the enhancement would be spaced out over a few years. The enhanced limit will be applicable only after the RBI issues a circular. “Sebi officials felt till such a circular is issued, fund houses should not make any incremental investments abroad,” the source said. A statement from the government could also come during the finance minister’s Budget speech on Tuesday, the source said. Balasubramanian, however, clarified that the current situation was not a big challenge and he’s hopeful it would be resolved soon. Indian fund houses have been investing abroad for over a decade. The trend, however, has gathered pace in the last couple of years after fund houses started launching exchange-traded funds and feeder funds to invest in schemes that are sold and managed abroad. Another perceptible trend is existing equity schemes investing part of their corpus abroad. Although Sebi had allowed fund houses to invest up to 15% of their total corpus abroad about a decade ago, for several years there were only a handful of schemes that utilised this limit. A large number of Indian fund managers, however, have taken this route only in the last three years. These two factors together have led Indian fund houses to close in on the Sebi imposed $7-billion limit to invest abroad.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/mf-body-asks-fund-houses-to-freeze-foreign-investments/articleshow/89230445.cms||---

He will bring the six rail assets (a portfolio of 690km in terms of track length, see graphic) under Adani Tracks Management Services — a 100% arm of the listed Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone. The consolidation will allow Adani, who is targeting to have a portfolio of 2,000km of track length by 2025, to participate in public-private partnership projects of the Indian Railways “without having to compete with similar businesses in the Adani portfolio”, a statement from the group said. According to the country’s rail plan 2020, the Indian Railways will invest more than Rs 3 lakh crore over 10 years to construct new rail lines. Further, the government’s shift in focus from road to rail as the preferred mode of transport, an obvious choice both economically and environmentally, will require significant participation from the private sector. Adani has built the rail portfolio mainly through public-private partnerships and acquisitions. He bought 20% in Kutch Railway (the government holds the rest), covering a track length of 301km (the longest rail track in his portfolio) and acquired the Krishnapatnam Rail Company, covering a track length of 113km. He gained equity interest (about 13%) in the latter following the acquisition of Krishnapatnam Port in Andhra Pradesh (the second-largest private sector port in the country). The balance (87%) in Krishnapatnam Rail is held by the government. Consolidating the rail transportation businesses under Adani Tracks Management Services will help the business tycoon to channelise investments to this specific entity as against multiple entities that have a play in the same segment. It will also help Adani to tap opportunities in adjacent areas like participating in the General Purpose Wagon Investment Scheme (GPWIS) of the Indian Railways. This scheme allows the private sector to invest in wagons and rakes to transfer certain commodities like coal, iron ore and minerals. Until four years ago, the transportation of these commodities were controlled by the Indian Railways. There is significant growth potential in the rail transportation business as it is yet to mature, Adani Ports had said in a presentation last March.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/adani-to-merge-rail-ops-in-single-co/articleshow/89230393.cms||---

This we believe is a token contribution to transform the country,” the Goa University circular states. Every teacher will be required to submit an individual report on the community work done by them, the varsity has said. The report will have to cover description of the work carried out, outcome of the work, documentary evidence and feedback. “Every teacher has the ethical responsibility to contribute to the improvement of the society and the environment, catering to specific needs of the community, particularly the less endowed, marginalised and exploited sections of society,” the Goa University’s circular states. The university has suggested that teachers can take up work in the form of awareness programmes, mentoring, training workshops, demonstrations, translation of scientific material for popular audiences and in local languages, hands-on community interventions, etc. “The projects undertaken will not be funded by Goa University nor will any remunerated work be considered as community work. All the institutes/colleges should maintain the records of 75 hours of community work done by their teachers, to be produced as and when called for,” the GU circular states.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/gu-college-teachers-must-take-up-75-hours-of-community-service/articleshow/89256403.cms||---

For those who miss the Dasoha there are hundreds of eateries a few meters away,” she said.“A food zone will pose a number of challenges, including arranging for drinking water, managing the food waste, etc. In such a scenario, this project is uncalled for,” she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/activists-greens-oppose-food-zone-plan-atop-chamundi-hills/articleshow/89231946.cms||---

The miffed legislator on Sunday took objection to Simha’s remark against him on failing to ensure the party candidate’s victory in the MCC polls from the ward where he belongs to and questioned the MP on the number of BJP candidates he has ensured victory in the panchayat polls. “Being the MP for the past seven years, how many party candidates have won in zilla panchayat and taluk panchayat elections due to him. While I served as a corporator representing my birthplace of KG Koppal in Mysuru city and worked hard to become an MLA, Simha never contested any local body elections but won the Lok Sabha election by sheer luck. I will surrender to him if he gets elected to ZP from his native place,” he said. Stating that during the assembly election, he did not get a lead in KG Koppal as the rival candidate too was from the same place, Nagendra said he is confident of getting a lead in the next election. “However during the Lok Sabha election, my constituency people gave the highest votes to you (Simha) appreciating my development works. But you are responsible for the defeat of party candidates in the MCC and MLC elections,” he said. He also warned the MP to not compare himself with Mysuru Maharaja Nalwadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar. “No politician ever can initiate development projects like Mysuru Maharajas,” he said Reacting to the gas pipeline project, Nagendra said he is not against the project. “Neither the corporators nor I have any knowledge about the company which has taken up the project. Recently in Visakhapatnam, 14 people died due to a gas leakage. As I am concerned about the safety of my people, I want the company to give a demo on the work and clarify on who will be repairing the roads which will be dup-up to lay gas pipelines,” he said. He also raised doubts on the special interest shown by MP Simha on the company entrusted with the project. “The company must discuss the work with MCC corporators and officials and get approval,” he said. After releasing documents on the Rs 500 crore funds which he had received from government for various development works in his segment, Nagendra said he has already brought to the notice of chief minister Basavaraj Bommai and district minster ST Somashekar on the recent developments. “I will discuss the issue in the party forum,” he said. Meanwhile, BJP sources said Nagendra has approached party leaders complaining against the MP even as Simha has complained to party state chief Nalin Kumar Kateel. Sources said both the leaders have placed before party leaders their contention about the project.In Bengaluru, chief minister Basavaraj Bommai has said that he will soon meet the warring parties and find a solution.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/mp-vs-mla-war-of-words-continues/articleshow/89231949.cms||---

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Resentment brews as Krishna to lose Nuzividu after district rejig||VIJAYAWADA: Government’s decision to form new districts has sparked a row of controversies in Krishna district. The district will lose Nuzividu once new districts are carved out on the basis of Parliamentary constituencies. Nuzividu area has great significance in Krishna district. Nuzividu is an estate which was formed in 1652 and was one of the oldest Zamindari in Madras presidency. Nuzividu Zami comprising 18 parganas and 288 villages was later merged with Krishna district after it was annexed to the government of India in 1949.  Mango orchards are abundant in Nuzividu region. Around 45,685 tonnes of mangoes were exported to various parts of the country in 2019-20. Nuzividu is 50 kilometres away from Vijayawada and 35 kilometres from Eluru city in West Godavari.  After the reorganisation of districts, the Nuzividu region will be merged with the proposed Eluru district. “Nuzividu region is connected with Krishna region for centuries. Forming districts based on Parliamentary constituencies is not acceptable. Boundaries of Parliamentary constituencies will change after delimitation and Nuzividu may again get merged with Machilipatnam or Vijayawada constituency. Government should understand the sentiments of people,” said Muddaraboyina Venkateswara Rao, former MLA.  Trade chambers and civic associations in Nuzividu have started agitations opposing the decision and are planning to take up stir with a demand to keep it in Machilipatnam district. Meanwhile, on Sunday, Kakani Aasaya Saadhana Samiti (KASS) demanded that the government rename the new Vijayawada district after Kakani Venkataratnam who was a minister and three-time MLA from the district. Kakani was known as ‘Iron Man of Andhra.’ The KASS submitted a representation to district collector J Nivas and requested him to take up the matter with state government.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/resentment-brews-as-krishna-to-lose-nuzividu-after-dist-rejig/articleshow/89231962.cms||Venu Lanka

---||Vijayawada||AP high court: Ensure reservation for transgenders in 3 months||VIJAYAWADA: The Andhra Pradesh high court directed the state government to implement the Supreme Court judgement to provide reservation to transgenders in three months. In a recent judgment, the high court directed the state government to undertake a study on the problems being faced by the transgenders. The high court observed that not providing transgender category for declaring gender identity in the employment notifications is unthoughtful. One Matam Gangabhavani, who claimed to be a transgender, moved the high court challenging the notification issued for recruitment of sub-inspector (SI) rank officers. Gangabhavani contended the notification for not providing separate reservation for transgenders. Arguing on behalf of Gangabhavani, M Soloman Raju told the high court that the petitioner was a male by birth but later converted as transgender after undergoing a surgical procedure. Raju argued that the SI recruitment notification did not even provide an option to declare the petitioner’s gender identity and she had to identify herself as woman in the absence of appropriate option. She appeared for the written examination but later she was declared as unfit for the post which forced her to move the high court. Government pleader Y Vivekananda argued that the state government was ready to implement the Supreme Court guidelines in case of transgenders. However, the petitioner is not a transgender by birth but changed her gender by surgical procedure and hence she cannot claim reservation, he said. Considering the arguments on both sides, Justice M Satyanarayana Murthy observed that transgenders are being neglected by the state government. They are not given equal opportunities on par with males and females. Though transgenders find a place in ancient literatures, the Constitution is silent on transgenders. Justice Satyanarayana Murthy further noted that though the Supreme Court directed the government to provide reservation to transgenders in recruitments under educationally and socially backward class, no steps were taken. As the apex court left the percentage of reservation up to the government, the high court noted that it cannot consider the SI recruitment notification as illegal. While dismissing the petition, the high court directed the government to undertake a study to identify the problems faced by transgenders and to implement the Supreme Court guidelines within three months.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/ensure-reservation-for-transgenders-in-3-mnths/articleshow/89231965.cms||Srikanth Aluri

It is played during festival seasons, especially Dasara Navaratri. The play has a connection with the cultural and religious practices of people.Raju argued that there are 11 main characters in the play and 24 artists used to portray different roles. The state government banned the play based on the objections received on one character named ‘Subbi Shetty’ but it has ignored the 23 other characters and the social message of the play.The state government’s decision to ban the play will infringe the right to life of artists playing the other characters, he argued.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/mp-moves-hc-challenges-go-banning-chintamani/articleshow/89231968.cms||---

As per an estimate, 27,79,163 persons in above 18 age group have got the first jab while only 19,68,155 have received the second vaccine.Given its focus on urban areas during these occasional drives, rural areas have been miserably lagging in the race of vaccination, considering which, the administration has decided to lay emphasis on rural areas now.Admitting this slow-paced vaccination in rural areas, district magistrate Himanshu Gupta, said that 105% vaccination rate has been reported in urban areas and now there was the need to focus on rural areas.Directing the SDMs, BCMOs and BEOs to put in efforts in their respective areas, Gupta asked them to give each CHA and ANM a target of 100 vaccines on this day of ‘Maha-Abhiyan’.

According to additional SP Dharmendra Kumar Yadav, the reports prima facie suggest that the building was used for storing turpentine oil. Jamwaramgarh SHO Jogendra Rathore have named the victims as follows, Ramesh alias Kalu Ram (25), Divya (2), Garima (3), and Ankush (5). Police said that three others were injured in the fire and were undergoing treatment in the hospital. ‘Building was used to pack oil into small canisters’According to Jamwaramgarh deputy SP Shiv Kumar Bhardwaj, the incident took place at Dhoola Raoji village. “It appears that the building was used to pack oil from large drums into small packets,” he said. The building was made up of one room with a tin shed on farmland. Police said it belonged to one Shankar Lal Saini and the victims and injured were members of his family and relatives. All victims are residents of the same Dhoola Raoji village. Police described the building as a “factory”, but suspect that it was run without legal permit and safety norms. Shankar Lal Saini’s house is located nearby the building and kids had gathered to play inside it before the explosion took place, suspected to be due to some short circuit. Mahendra Pal Meena, a local resident and leader in Jamwaramgarh, said that the incident took place early in the morning when the kids were present inside the building. “It was a very tragic accident. We expect the victims' families will be given some compensation,” he said.

The kids were reportedly trapped inside and died in the blaze. “The accident took place in the morning. It took us more than an hour to douse the flames,” he said, adding that the injured have also sustained serious injuries and were undergoing treatment at SMS Hospital in Jaipur.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Man killed woman to steal anklets to clear debt, held||JAIPUR: A 19-year-old boy killed an elderly woman and chopped off her feet before stealing her anklets to pay off debts he amassed playing an online card game in Jamwaramgarh. The Jaipur (rural) police cracked the mystery behind Geeta Devi’s (55) murder after three months and arrested the prime accused Pawan Kumar. The four accused who purchased stolen jewellery were idenitfied as Suraj Mal (20), Vishnu (19), Updesh (25) and Dinesh Bairwa (22). Devi’s body was discovered in a pool of blood on October 10 last year in Khetpura village where she had gone to graze cattle. The missing jewellery raised the suspicion of murder for robbery. The murder sparked off a series of protests that included local leaders visiting the spot, demanding justice. According to additional SP (headquarters) Dharmendra Kumar Yadav, the murder was treated as a “blind case,” because there was no electronic trail like CCTVs. “We used conventional investigation procedure and constituted different teams that fanned out on multiple fronts. We spoke and quizzed nearly 3,000 persons during which we stumbled across an intelligence input about a suspect,” he said. As per Yadav, the police learned that the suspect, Pawan Kumar was trying to sell silver jewellery. The police interrogated him and found that the accused was addicted to a mobile game, “teen Patti.” He spent most of his days inside his house playing the game after his college classes were shut due to the pandemic. He lost around Rs 20,000 in the game and needed the money to pay off debt. “He (Kumar) is a resident of the same Khetpura village and knew that local women wore anklets and other jewellery while grazing cattle. He knew the victim’s movements too,” Yadav said. The accused used his axe and went to the spot where Geeta Devi had gone with cattle and murdered her after hitting on her head and neck. He chopped her off her feet and decamped with her silver anklets. Yadav was the nodal officer who had different teams that included over 150 cops to track down the accused. “Our teams went to Madhya Pradesh, Tonk, Bharatpur and Bhilwara in pursuit of the accused because it was a completely blind case,” he said. SHO (Jamwaramgarh) Jogendra Singh Rathore said that the police visited different cities to analyse cases where similar crimes had taken place in the last 10 years. “We even collected information from prisons and travelled widely to find the accused. Our teams every day quizzed nearly 20 people,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/man-killed-woman-to-steal-anklets-to-clear-debt-held/articleshow/89231973.cms||---

---||Goa||Fill posts in consumer disputes body in 3 months: HC to govt||Panaji: The high court of Bombay at Goa has directed the state, through its chief secretary, to ensure that the posts of president and three members lying vacant at the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission are filled “as expeditiously as possible and, in any case, within three months from today (Monday)”. It added that the process of issuing advertisements need not be delayed on account of the code of conduct, which has presently been enforced in the state. “The state administration comprises several IAS officers and the least that is expected is that they find solutions to the problems now set out in the affidavit so that the commission functions effectively in terms of the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act,” the court stated. It noted that “only difficulties are being portrayed, with no serious efforts to resolve the same” in the affidavit of the director and ex-officio joint secretary (department of civil supplies and consumer affairs), Sudhir Kerkar. “These are matters relating to filling up quasi-judicial positions in terms of the mandate of the Consumer Protection Act. Such matters need not await the lifting of the code of conduct,” the court stated. “Having regard to past experience, where even after the time limits set out by this court, all that is informed are a fresh set of difficulties. We make it clear that this time we expect the chief secretary to personally look into this matter and ensure that not only the mandate of the statute but also this writ of mandamus, which we are issuing, is complied with within three months from today. If there is no compliance, then we are afraid we will be constrained to view the matter with utmost seriousness,” stated the division bench comprising Justices Mahesh Sonak and R N Laddha. The petition filed by Dr D J De Souza highlighted “an extremely unfortunate situation” in which the very functioning of the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (Commission) has been brought to a virtual standstill on account of the inordinate delay in filling up the post of the president and three of its four member posts. For almost 15 months, the commission has been reportedly functioning with only one member, the petition stated.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/fill-posts-in-consumer-disputes-body-in-3-months-hc-to-govt/articleshow/89256420.cms||Lisa Monteiro

Analysis of sub-lineages of Omicron, which is driving the third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, was conducted by the SMS medical college. It shows that apart from the original strain of Omicron, its sub-lineages BA.2 and BA.1.1.529 are also spreading fast in the state. In the analysis of the Omicron variant cases, the SMS medical college and RUHS has found that 47.7% of samples tested positive for the original BA.1 variant, while 48.2% of samples tested positive for its sub-lineage BA.2. It shows that the BA.2 sub-lineage has now superseded BA.1 (original strain of Omicron) in the state. Besides, BA.1 and BA.2, around 4.18% of samples returned positive for the BA.1.1.529 sub-lineage. The health department and doctors are now taking measures to find out the difference in symptoms in the two sub-lineages and one original strain (BA.1), along with the severity, which each of them- BA.1, BA.2 and BA.1.1.529 is causing in patients. "Our genome sequencing report shows that two sub-lineages and original strain BA.1 are now spreading in the state. We are now making efforts to find out which variant is now causing more severity or is there any difference in symptoms among patients of BA.1, BA.2 or BA.1.1.529," said Dr Sudhir Bhandari, working vice-chancellor RUHS and principal and controller, SMS medical college. "We are conducting genome sequencing at SMS medical college of the samples of all patients brought to RUHS hospital for differentiating symptoms and severity in BA.1 and its sub-lineages- BA.2 and BA.1.1.529. The genome sequencing will be done of patients with different grades of severity, asymptomatic, mild, moderate, requiring oxygen, requiring non-invasive ventilator support or invasive ventilator support," said Dr Bhandari. "We are now analysing clinical presentation of BA.1, BA.2, and BA.1.1.529. Initially, we have found that they have more or less the same clinical presentations. Since BA.2 is now spreading faster, we are keeping a close eye on the patients in the hospital for doing in-depth study on sub-lineages of omicron," said Dr Ajit Singh, superintendent of the state’s biggest dedicated Covid-19 RUHS hospital. In the state, the first nine cases of Omicron (BA.1) were reported on December 5. A family of four, who had arrived at Jaipur from South Africa on November 25, and 5 persons of a family in Adarsh Nagar, whom they met on the same day of arrival, had tested positive for Omicron. Since December 5, the cases increased and in January, it picked up the pace and caused more than 150 deaths till January 29.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/sub-lineages-of-omicron-spreading-rapidly-in-raj/articleshow/89231976.cms||Syed Intishab Ali

People who subscribe to the ideology of those who assassinated Gandhiji are becoming members of parliament,” said Gehlot. The entire world was shocked to learn about the assassination of Gandhiji. “Scientist Albert Einstein said that the coming generation will never believe that a person like Gandhiji walked on the earth once,” recalled Gehlot. He accused BJP and RSS of spearheading the troll army on social media to suppress the dissenting voices. “In democracy even those who are against you are welcome and everybody has a right to disagree. At present, the situation has reached to an extent that if you criticise or choose to disagree, you will be seen as a traitor. I believe that it is a matter of concern for every citizen in what direction the country is heading,” said Gehlot. Defending his government on the REET paper leak, he argued that organised paper leak rackets exist in every state. “These gangs exist in different states like in Bihar, UP, the Vyapam scandal in Madhya Pradesh had shaken the entire country. But here, we swung into action as soon as it came to our notice. The responsibility was given to the SOG and I think, within a very short time they did what no one had expected. Even leader of opposition Gulab Chand Kataria has praised SOG for his investigation,” said Gehlot. Reacting to the New York Times expose on Pegasus spyware, he said, “If the government is clear that they have not spied on anyone, then PM Narendra Modi should address the nation and clear the confusion ”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/parliament-has-mps-with-ideology-that-killed-bapu/articleshow/89231977.cms||---

The leopard, which strayed from the nearby Jhalana forest reserve, was spotted in the residential area on Saturday night, following which forest officials made announcements, asking people to stay indoors. Nearly four-year-old male leopard, which entered the Raj Angan society, was tranquilized around 10.50 am. Eyewitnesses claimed that around 6:00 AM, the wild cat was seen moving out of the house number R-11 and walking on the colony road. After this, it again sat down in the lawn of the house. When the rescue team tried to dart the animal, it ran inside the colony and took refuge in house number R-26. An official said, “The animal was tranquilised in the third attempt. After two failed attempts by the forest team, senior veterinary officer Arvind Mathur darted the animal,” After the medical examination, the leopard was released in the forest. However, the department did not disclose the location to maintain its safety. Straying of leopards in residential areas has become common as their numbers continue to swell in Jhalana Reserve. In December, a leopard had entered a house in Malviya Nagar sector 7. Earlier, in October, a leopardess escaped from Jhalana and took refuge in Moti Doongri foothills, which is surrounded by rich green vegetation and rocks. On December 12 last year, a leopard had entered the posh Kanota Bagh Colony on Takht-E-Shahi Road and SMS School. Wildlife experts had suggested radio collaring a few male leopards to learn about their movements. The issue should be addressed immediately as it can lead to human-animal conflict. “In the state wildlife boards meeting, the senior officials were requested to take up the project. However, nothing has been done so far,” said an expert.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/leopard-strays-into-citys-nri-colony-rescued-after-15-hours/articleshow/89231983.cms||---

Rajasthan has proposed the closure of the IGNP for 60 days from March 20 to May 20, while Punjab is adamant to close it for 70 days from March 1 to May 15. The department of water resource has shot a letter to its counterpart in Punjab arguing that the state doesn’t have enough water resources/banks to store water for more than 60 days. The state wanted the closure to take place after Holi which is falling on March 17-18. In the letter, the department told that they have a wide network of 10,000 kilometre to supply 2,000 cusec of water every day through IGNP in 10 districts whose total land area is bigger than Punjab. “The IGNP water is supplied for both drinking and irrigation purposes while the canal network in Punjab is very small and they have an alternate mode of water supply like tube wells ensuring a consistent supply. The closure cost state around Rs 60-70 crore, most of the money goes to provide water through tankers and creating alternate arrangements,” said Amarjeet Meharda, chief engineer, department water resources, Hanumangarh. The department recalled the 70 days closure of IGNP last year started from March 28 to June first week created an avoidable water crisis in districts under IGNP. “The repeat of 70 days would create the same crises,” said Meharda. Punjab is adamantly citing the reason that the central government has set the deadline of 2022 for the repair of the entire IGNP in 2019. “The deadline was set in 2019 but the repair work started in 2020 Punjab government wanted to adjust the loss of one year by increasing 10 to 20 days every year which they can adjust because they have enough number water resources but the desert state is not in a position to stretch beyond 60 days,” said an official. The water resource department has directed district collectors under the Indira Gandhi Nagar project to fill all the water resources including pond’s lakes thanks by the end of the first week of March thereafter the water resource department will rationalise the use of water according to the availability in water resources.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/raj-punjab-at-loggerheads-over-sharing-of-ignp-water/articleshow/89231995.cms||Shoeb Khan

The number of rescues was fewer in 2020 compared to 2021 due to the lockdown that came into force on March 24 that year. Also with restrictions on international commercial flights, Goa did not receive foreign tourists till mid-December of 2021. It was also the reason Goa witnessed an influx of domestic tourists. In 2020, as the first wave ebbed post-September, the state’s domestic inflow increased and it dwindled only after February 2021 as the second wave started surfacing. From October to December-end last year Goa witnessed a massive rise in domestic footfalls even as parts of the country saw a rise in Covid infections. Last year, Drishti said that the rise in rescues was due to an increase in footfalls post-August as the period coincided with the slowdown of the pandemic. In October alone, 115 incidents were reported followed by 81 in November and 45 in December keeping the lifesavers on their toes. Of the 715 rescues, over 600 were of Indian nationals including locals, while 14 were foreigners. The majority of those rescued were in the age group of 19 to 35, while 93 were children. Drishti said that 57 incidents reported in 2021 were related to children reported missing on the beach. In all cases, the missing children were found and reunited with their families. Also a maximum of 196 incidents were reported from Calangute, 112 from Candolim and 45 Candolim in 2021. There were 41 rescues at Dudhsagar waterfalls during the monsoon. In South Goa, Palolem recorded 35 incidents followed by 24 in Colva and 23 in Benaulim. Drishti has been operating in Goa since 2008. The state government was prompted to hire a professional lifeguarding agency after 400 drownings were reported in 2007.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/drishti-rescued-715-beach-goers-last-year-as-tourism-activity-picked-up/articleshow/89256434.cms||---

Aboobakar Kulai, district president SDPI, Dakshina Kannada, alleged that NRIs from Dakshina Kannada, Udupi and Kasaragod district in Kerala use the airport for travelling to Gulf and other countries. In recent years, the passengers who depart and arrive at this airport, are being subjected to harassment and mental abuse, he alleged.Explaining about various types of harassment, he said that since MIA has direct flights only to Gulf countries, it is a commonplace to buy tickets to travel in a connecting flight from one country to another, however, if a passenger has such air tickets, the personnel demand that the passengers produce the visa of both the countries.“Officers also complain about errors in the passport. For example, if a passenger has minimum visa validity, they are needlessly subjected to irrelevant questions,” he said. They also make statements like, “You are not eligible to travel abroad”. A first time passenger is looked upon with suspicion and passengers who visit multiple times are questioned on the purpose of travel, he said.“Those arriving from abroad too are not spared,” the SDPI alleged, adding that they are harassed by being levied fines for bringing used mobile phones, for wearing jewellery, and seizing items like toys and electronic gadgets.The members also expressed their apprehension on many testing positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus during the rapid RT-PCR test, in spite of having negative certificates from ICMR approved labs. “A majority of those who go abroad are blue collar workers who are poor. Such harassment being meted to them is unacceptable,” they said, adding all these incidents have forced several passengers to avoid flying from MIA and going abroad from Bengaluru, Kerala and Mumbai airports.They demanded to rectify this issue, and allow for a smooth journey of passengers at MIA. MIA officials were not available for comments.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/intl-passengers-harassed-at-mia-sdpi/articleshow/89232001.cms||---

Though right-wing outfits have expressed concern over the rise in cattle thefts in recent days, not many dairy farmers come forward to report the thefts to police, mainly because they are not compensated. There have been many cases of cattle being stolen from grazing fields, and thefts repeatedly happening from the same cattle shed, yet only a few cases reach the police station, said Sunil K R, state convener of Bajrang DalAbout 56 cases related to cattle thefts and illegal transportation of cattle were reported last year. Under the Karnataka Prevention of Cow Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Act, last year, 28 cases were registered in Dakshina Kannada district police limits. Police had arrested 21 people and rescued 32 cattle heads. Meanwhile, in the Mangaluru city police limits, 28 cases were registered, and 59 accused have been arrested. Police have also rescued more than 30 cattle heads. A VHP delegation visited Bolpugudde, Pachanady and Bondel areas, and interacted with farmers where incidents of cattle theft were reported. There have been several cattle theft instances in areas surrounding Bolpugudde. The VHP has been demanding that the government compensate families that have lost cattle. Meanwhile, a senior officer from the department of animal husbandry and veterinary services said that there could be a marginal decrease in dairy farming in recent days, but that cannot be attributed to cattle thefts alone. Whenever, arecanut, a major commercial crop cultivated in Dakshina Kannada fetches a good price in the market, there is a decline in dairy farming, the officer said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/cattle-theft-with-no-compensation-plaints-seldom-lodged/articleshow/89232004.cms||---

Problems in the liver contributed to the death of many patients. All Covid patients who have died during the third wave breathed their last in the hospitals. No Covid patient isolated at home has been reported dead. The case fatality rate is, however, markedly lower than it was during the first and second waves of Covid,” said Dr Kishore Kumar said.The DHO admitted that the Covid curve spiked in Dakshina Kannada during the second and third weeks of January, and the number of patients who had to be hospitalised too rose, albeit slightly, in that period. “In the past week, those who have died were those in whom the infection was severe, in addition to suffering from other illnesses for a prolonged period.

After recording robust attendance despite prevailing Covid conditions, teachers are noticing several students taking sick leave in recent days.“The gradual dip in attendance is because children are easily catching a cold due to the prevailing weather conditions. Parents prefer not to send their children to school for a few days. As a result, there is a drop in attendance across all schools,” said Shambhu Shankar, the coordinator of the block resource centre in Belthangady. Children with a running nose and fever are not attending school for at least three days.Parents also avoid sending children to school whenever they have slight symptoms or when they are completely healthy. “For example, a private school in Attavar has switched to online mode for a few days even though the campus did not report any Covid cases,” said Prashanth Kumar K, the block education officer (south).An official pointed out that there are no chronic or long absences. The department has informed every school that a child is free to take leave whenever sick and return only after complete recovery. “We have noticed that many children are down with the common flu, cold and cough,” he said.Sudhakar K, DDPI, Dakshina Kannada, said that as of January 25, as many as 349 students and 60 teachers had tested positive for Covid-19.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/dk-schools-see-dip-in-attendance-as-children-develop-cold-and-flu/articleshow/89232007.cms||---

The farmers, cutting across the party lines, were led by Shetkari Sanghatana. They started the agitation at 11am on Sunday to protest against the snapping of a three-phase power supply to 1,172 agricultural consumers. At the time of agitation, when the farmers climbed the EHV transformer, the Maharashtra State Electricity Transmission Corporation Limited (MSETCL) quickly switched off the power supply to the tower prevent any untoward incident. “The distribution company snapped the power supply on Friday all of a sudden, causing inconvenience to all the farmers in the village. Wells are the only source of water for drinking and other purposes, and power is required to pull up the water,” Ramnath Dhikle, a farmer, said. Another farmer, Anil Dhikle, alleged that the power utility had issued bills with higher amount by charging 5 horse-power (HP) power rates to the farmers with 3 HP motors and since 2010, the farmers have been seeking the corrected bills. “We demand that MSEDCL should issue correct bills to farmers who have 3 HP or 5 HP powered motors. We are sure the bills will come down by 50%. Secondly, we also want the power utility to issue correct current bills to the farmers so that farmers can settle the current bills instantly,” Anil Dhikle said. MSEDCL Nashik superintendent engineer Dnyandeo Padalkar said 1,172 farmers had outstanding dues of Rs 14.76 crore after government subsidy. Further, the farmers now have to clear only Rs 7.67 crore as per Mahakrushi Abhiyaan, in which the penalty and interest have been waived if the farmers settle dues and pay current bills. “Against charges of Rs 1,000 per 3 HP per month, the farmers have to pay around Rs 600 per month (after they take benefit of Mahakrushi Ahiyaan). Since none of the farmers had settled their dues for the past 10 years, the step had been taken,” said Padalkar. The power supply was restored around 4pm, and the agitation was called off after successful negotiation by MP Hemant Godse. “The MSEDCL has issued inflated bills, and the farmers are demanding correct bills which the MSEDCL should issue at the earliest,” said Godse adding that the power has been reinstated for now. A meeting between the villagers and MSEDCL authorities has been scheduled on Monday, which will further decide the course of agitation, the farmers said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/pimpri-sayyed-farmers-climb-electric-tower-to-protest-against-power-cut/articleshow/89232009.cms||---

Rs 50 lakh has been sought from the district planning committee for the institute.“We have decided to have a SPI for girls with an intake capacity of 50. It will be based on the lines of the SPI for boys in Aurangabad. It will, however, be exclusively for girls,” Bhuse said.The minister said 25 girls each from Classes XI and XII can take admission for the course where the students will be taught subjects required for their qualification to the National Defence Academy (NDA).“The SPI for girls assumes significance as the Supreme Court has directed the army to consider all serving female officers for the grant of permanent commissions as against short service commissions. So the girls in the district and region should also benefit from the opportunity to get into the NDA,” Bhuse said. The girls will also get coaching on the Services Selection Board so that they can appear for the UPSC and get admitted to the NDA. “I have spoken to the officers of the Maharashtra Police Academy for physical and mental training of the girls and with the Nashik Municipal Corporation for lessons in swimming. I have also spoken with others to provide all the necessary coaching required for these girls,” the minister said. About the infrastructure, the minister said that Rs 50 lakh sought from the district administration would be utilized to build a floor each in the two hostels for the wards of ex-servicemen that are operational in the city, besides engaging the tutors and other requirements for the girls during their preparations. District collector Suraj Mandhare said the proposal has been accepted by the district planning committee and funds of Rs 50 lakh required for construction of two floors would be provided soon.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/services-preparatory-institute-for-girls-to-come-up-in-nashik/articleshow/89232010.cms||---

Most of the cases pertained to over-speeding, parking in no-parking areas, not wearing helmets or seatbelts and wrong-side driving.The number of cases in 2021 was, however, less than the number of erring motorists challaned in 2020 when 2.60 lakh motorists were booked by the traffic police.The maximum number of cases in 2021 were booked in January, when over 28,000 motorists were challaned. In May, the traffic police challaned just over 9,500 erring motorists when the second Covid wave was at its peak.The highest number of violators (52,000) were booked for over-speeding vehicles, followed by over 19,000 motorists who were challaned for not using seatbelts. Close to 11,800 bikers were booked for not using helmets and over 15,000 motorists were caught jumping signals.ACP Seetaram Gaikwad said that due to a large number of accidents on the city streets, their action against erring motorists is almost continuous. Currently, the traffic police are focusing on bikers without helmets given that a large number of bikers die in road accidents only because of not wearing the safety headgear.According to police records, last year, there were 470 road accidents in the city in which 185 people died and another 340 were seriously injured. Moreover, 63 others suffered minor injuries and 25 escaped with no injury.

At the same time, the number of active cases in Sinnar taluka has dropped from 700 to 580.“Active cases in the taluka are going down, however, cases in industrial areas are somewhat stagnant and this is largely because of large number of people visiting the area from outside, or locals travelling to other places due to which they are prone to infection,” Dr Mohan Bachchhav, taluka health officer of Sinnar, said.The number of cases has dropped, but the health authorities are not taking the situation lightly. “The numbers are dropping which is a good sign, but we do not want to take any chance. Hence, testing, tracking and treatment is being carried out on regular basis. This is also resulting in faster treatment and recovery of patients,” he added.The number of Covid cases in the industrial areas account for about 25% of the total cases in the taluka . “Since business activity cannot be stopped, the number of infections will also continue. The number of cases have dropped from 180 to 160. The drop in cases is being reflected better in the other areas,” another senior official said. The health authorities and administration are taking steps to spread awareness among the masses and people in the industrial sector. “This is ongoing process and the our teams are visiting them at regular intervals for inspection,” the officer added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/in-sinnar-industrial-area-case-count-stagnant-over-past-week/articleshow/89232015.cms||---

Shailesh Kute, a hotel owner and a member of the association, said that the hotel and restaurant businesses are better during the third wave. The business has increased up to 50% during the third. But we can make a profit only after we are allowed at least 75% occupancy. Currently, hotels and restaurants are allowed to operate with 50% of the seating capacity only, and we are still incurring losses in meeting the operational cost, added Kute.Gaurav Chandak, the association president, said the hotels and restaurants were closed due to the lockdown during the first and the second waves, but the business is usual during the third wave even though they were still incurring around 5% losses.Another hotelier said that people were more panicked during the first wave and fatalities were more during the second wave. But the scenario is better now. Shridhar Shetti, the general secretary of the Association of Bar, Hotels and Restaurants, said that bars and restaurants incurred heavy losses during the first and the second waves. Business has still not recovered due to the third wave. Hence, the government should give concessions in license fees or provide a relief package to this sector.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/restaurants-hotels-coping-better-during-third-wave/articleshow/89232020.cms||---
---||Delhi||A Taste of Domesticity||A fallout of the deeply unfamiliar modes of living we have been forced to adopt in these pandemic times is a renewed experience of the domestic. Being home all the time is a new experience for many who used to work outside home and even for those working within the confines of the home, the experience of having everyone around all the time is a novel one. This is, of course, not domesticity in its purest form, for there is still official work to be done; the home is merely the site where it happens. But the lines between work and home and, in a larger sense, between the outside and the inside have been blurred. Our presence is divided between the physical site of our being and our simulation that lives digitally on the screen. But for all that, there is no escape from a heightened engagement with some version of domesticity. At a certain age, there is no idea that is more dreaded and disdained than domesticity. The feeling that one will surrender to the placid mundaneness of routine, finding meaning in the dreariness of the everyday, makes the young shiver in terror. Domesticity is read as a sign of going to seed, surrendering to the gravitational pull of time as the unchallenging comfort of home sucks out initiative and deadens drive. Getting domesticated is to get irreparably tamed and lose any desire to do anything meaningful. The home is imagined as a drone of contentment, the outside as the buzz of heady excitement. Go out in the world and create something meaningful and lasting, to leave an indelible mark, to wrestle with uncertainty and tame the wild — that is what true human endeavour is imagined to be. We know a lot about the campaigns and conquests of kings, but little about their shopping lists or plumbers. The sense of home is the sense of mundaneness. Of everyday blurring into each other, familiar people making familiar sounds as familiar foods get cooked in the kitchen. Of patterns repeating themselves. Of old emotions being experienced over and over again. The idea of a home is a collage of domesticity. It is the combination of a sense of responsibility and belonging packaged in the unremarkable. Every home has its unique pattern of repetition, its own particular rhyme. There is a sound to domesticity, a cadence of ordinariness, a rustle of the predictable, a babble of the boring. Utensils are shuffled about, a doorbell rings, the radio is a hum of sonorousness in the background, some unnecessary instructions are shouted to the domestic help, the pressure cooker whistle goes off, somebody is talking loudly on the phone. The day hums along as time blends into tasks, vanishing into another day. This world is all time and space has become less relevant. The word humdrum, perhaps captures this feeling in sound as well as meaning. The mirror at home does not need to lie. It accepts us as who we are. We can revel in the dal-chawalness of everyday, while lounging in the comfort of old, slightly ragged clothes. We rebel against the officiousness of the outside world by determinedly embracing slovenliness. We need to drop the state of constant mobilisation that we have grown accustomed to in the outside world and sag under the weight of our unmanicured selves. The ability to live bedraggled, unsmooth lives is a joy, but one which admittedly outlives its welcome at some point. A sense of retrieved childhood is imbued with the sounds of domesticity; a visual picture of one’s home, interspersed with flashes of images and sounds. A transistor in the background, the rusty whirring of the fan, the tie-and-dye bedspreads on which one lies, reading an Arthur Hailey novel, the rattling of utensils in the kitchen accompanied by my mother humming an old Hindi film favourite. My brother and I have a prescribed set of chores — getting milk from the local booth, making beds, making tea in the afternoon, getting monthly PDS rations, paying water and electricity bills, booking (and cancelling) tickets for all the innumerable people who came visiting because we were in Delhi. The list was a long grumble-worthy one, or at least we thought so. Looking back, however, one is filled with a warm flush of accomplishment quite at odds with the scale of one’s efforts. It is as if one has paid one’s dues to domesticity and has legitimately earned a reprieve from it. It also allows one to lecture one’s kids about the many failures of their generation with a clear conscience. Historically, the idea of domesticity has been deeply gendered in nature with a neat division with male and female domains. It is easy to romanticise the domestic when one is not trapped inside it as a part of one’s destiny. Domesticity was both a woman’s arena for pride and a cauldron of resentment. The theatre of the domestic, which appears to be placid and uneventful, also seethes with a stifling sense of injustice and hairline cleaves that simply doesn’t heal. Women have been tasked the idea of, as Simone De Beauvoir put it, "turning a prison into a kingdom." That is changing, if not entirely so. The home is no longer as closed off to the outside world as it once was, and the gendered nature of spaces has reduced, particularly in urban areas. For many families, the experience during the pandemic is both a return to familiar patterns and the negotiation of new ones. With time ideas of domesticity will inevitably evolve. But its meaning is unlikely to change. We will continue to be reassured by its blandness while wary of its seductive ordinariness. Of course, with the mobile phone always next to us, are we ever really at home? santosh365@gmail.com||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/a-taste-of-domesticity/articleshow/89230022.cms||---

Concerned about the rise in Covid cases, the district administration had postponed the decision regarding reopening of schools as the state government had allowed the local authorities to take a decision depending on the local Covid situation. “The number of active cases has declined but this cannot be described as a trend yet. The situation is under control now and we will have to be very cautious in starting schools,” Bhosale said.“We will hold a meeting on this issue on Tuesday after which, the roadmap of opening the schools will be decided,” Bhosale added.ZP CEO Rajendra Kshirsagar said school authorities have been asked to be ready to start the classes physically as the decision would be taken very soon. “Schools may be asked to conduct sessions on alternate days or in two sessions on a single day to ensure maximum 50% attendance just like in the past,” a senior official from the education department said.School authorities are now well versed with the norms and they have already prepared to start the schools. There were 11,200 active cases in the district on January 24, and the number had fallen to about 10,000 by Saturday.“The drop is significant, but it is not a trend.

The proposed outer ring road, with a width of 24m, will help decongest traffic in main city areas and allow smooth movement of vehicles on the outskirts. Jadhav told TOI that he discussed the proposal with the state urban development minister Eknath Shinde, who has assured to provide funds for the outer ring road project. “We have been told to submit the proposal about the ring road project to the state government,” he said. Jadhav said with the city rapidly growing, there is a need for the outer ring road to increase the connectivity with the outskirts. “The proposed ring road will reduce the traffic congestion in the main city areas as the traffic will be diverted through the outer ring roads. The road will begin from the Adgaon towards other parts around the city outskirts,” he said. Moreover, the civic body has also proposed IT Park and the Logistic Park within the municipal corporation limits. The NMC administration has already invited separate expression of interests (EoI) to develop IT Park and Logistic Park in the city in joint ventures, where the land owners have land with a minimum area of 50 acre or more. The Logistic Park is to be developed within a 1 km radius on both sides of the proposed Surat Chennai highway. The proposed IT park project is the brainchild of mayor Satish Kulkarni, who recently approved the project during the general body meeting of the NMC. The civic body has already identified 15 acres in the Adgaon area of the city for the proposed IT Park.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/state-promises-300cr-for-nashik-outer-ring-road/articleshow/89232026.cms||---

---||Allahabad||UP polls: Priest of 200-year-old Shiva temple reciting mantras for BJP victory||PRAYAGRAJ: With the date of voting gradually approaching, parties, leaders, candidates and supporters are making all efforts for their victory. The priest of a 200-year-old Shiva temple at Bhagwanpur village in neighbouring Kaushambi district, Brijendra Narayan Mishra, who had installed a bust of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the temple in 2014, is again reciting mantras, shlokas and performing special puja for the victory of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the assembly polls. Mishra told TOI, “I had placed the bust of PM Modi in this 200-year-old Shiva temple on January 21, 2014, during parliamentary elections and performed a special puja of Lord Shiva praying that Modi ji becomes Prime Minister.” “With the blessings of Mahadev, Modi ji became Prime Minister in 2014 and again in 2019. This year also, I am chanting mantras and shlokas and performing special puja with the prayer that BJP retains power in the state,” he added. Clarifying that the temple is a ‘Shivala’ and not a ‘Modi temple’, Mishra said the PM’s bust is not worshipped. “We do not perform any puja of the PM’s bust but dust and clean it daily. I have put a woolen shawl on it recently since it is quite cold,” the priest added. I strongly believe Modi ji is also offering prayers to Lord Shiva for destruction of all the enemies of the nation, said Mishra. “I also perform puja of Lord Shiva, recite shlokas and mantras on behalf of Modi ji for country’s betterment but wish that the PM should visit this temple once whenever he can spare time,” he said. I am sure that Lord Shiva will ensure a thumping victory for BJP in the assembly polls, Mishra added emphatically.

The priest of a 200-year-old Shiva temple at Bhagwanpur village in neighbouring Kaushambi district, Brijendra Narayan Mishra, who had installed a bust of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the temple in 2014, is again reciting mantras, shlokas and performing special puja for the victory of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the assembly polls. Mishra told TOI, “I had placed the bust of PM Modi in this 200-year-old Shiva temple on January 21, 2014, during parliamentary elections and performed a special puja of Lord Shiva praying that Modi ji becomes Prime Minister.” “With the blessings of Mahadev, Modi ji became Prime Minister in 2014 and again in 2019. This year also, I am chanting mantras and shlokas and performing special puja with the prayer that BJP retains power in the state,” he added. Clarifying that the temple is a ‘Shivala’ and not a ‘Modi temple’, Mishra said the PM’s bust is not worshipped. “We do not perform any puja of the PM’s bust but dust and clean it daily. I have put a woolen shawl on it recently since it is quite cold,” the priest added. I strongly believe Modi ji is also offering prayers to Lord Shiva for destruction of all the enemies of the nation, said Mishra. “I also perform puja of Lord Shiva, recite shlokas and mantras on behalf of Modi ji for country’s betterment but wish that the PM should visit this temple once whenever he can spare time,” he said. I am sure that Lord Shiva will ensure a thumping victory for BJP in the assembly polls, Mishra added emphatically. Over the years, the temple has become quite popular in the region for its uniqueness. “People from the village and adjoining areas are emotionally linked with the temple. BJP supporters also offer prayers for the party’s triumph in the state assembly polls,” Mishra added. We all now believe that BJP won 2014 and 2019 parliamentary polls and 2017 state assembly polls with Lord Shiva’s grace and will again get a thumping majority in the state assembly with his blessings, said Ashok Kesarwani, a local.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/shiva-temple-priest-performing-special-puja-for-bjp-win/articleshow/89234517.cms||---

The civic authorities have stopped pig catching drives for the past few days, which has resulted in a rise in pigs seen roaming in the city. Gokul Road, Old Hubballi, Keshwapur, Gopankoppa, Bhavani Nagar, Ashok Nagar, Heggeri and other areas have turned into a haven for pigs. Dr Ravi Saligoudar, of veterinary department in Hubballi-Dharwas Municipal Corporation (HDMC), said the professional pig catchers are reluctant to carry on drives in Hubballi-Dharwad. “In the recent few weeks, the pig catchers could not get sufficient pigs to catch as the news about the drive was leaked. Hence, pig catchers are not showing interest to conduct drives,” he added. He said some catchers are not showing interest due to fear of attack by the pig owners. “We are getting suitable support from police, but due to the hectic work of Covid norm enforcement and other works police are too busy,” he added. Najeer Honyal, corporator from ward No 71, said HDMC officials must start pig catching drives. In residential areas too, pig numbers are increasing because of the negligence of officials, he said. Mohan C, a social activist, said the pig menace is more nowadays in Hubballi city mainly on Gokul Road, Vikas Nagar and other areas. Officials should act to curb this menace, he added. Dr Saligoudar said that based on the complaints received at the control room, HDMC is initiating action, adding that he will soon bring the problem of pigs catchers to the notice of the commissioner. After discussing with him a decision will be taken on resuming pig catching drives, he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/pig-menace-increases-as-hdmc-fails-to-take-action/articleshow/89232041.cms||---

Efficient irrigation systems, which ensure value for each drop of water, can find few regions more suitable for an experimental run, and one such device that achieves near-complete utilisation of water has been developed by Jayashri Pattanashetti of Vijayapura district. A diploma holder, Jayashri endeavoured to come up with a device that simplifies the sub-surface irrigation system in the wake of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s pithy exhortation to farmers – ‘Per Drop, More Crop’.“The device ensures complete utilisation of water, and is superior in this regard to every other existing sub-surface irrigation system. The device is nearly 10-12 inches in length, and comprises two parts – the upper part is cylinder-shaped, with a diameter of 1.5 inches, and extending up to eight inches in length. It is fit with tubes. While the upper tube is connected to a conventional drip line above the surface, the second tube performs the function of an air ventilator. The other entity of this device is a perforated funnel-shaped object, at the bottom of the cylinder. Once connected to the drip line, nearly half the length of the device is buried beneath the ground. Water from the drip line flows into the tubes of the device, and irrigates the soil,” Jayashri told TOI.Furthermore, the device is designed to alert farmers in the event of blockage in the funnel’s holes. “In such a scenario, the device gets filled with water to the brim, and gushes out through the air vent, alerting the farmer on the field. All the farmer has to do in such a situation is to lift the device, and rectify the connection to ensure water continues to be supplied without any interruption,” said Jayashri, adding that making the metallic device cost her Rs 500.“If it is made using PVC pipe plastic, it will last longer, while the cost of production will come down to Rs 40,” she added.Jayashri’s father MB Pattanashetti, a retired lecturer who taught mechanical engineering, said, “When she pitched the idea to me, I took her to a mechanic, who prepared this device.”The device was tested at Basavanabagewadi-based farmer Abdul Ragati’s grape farm. “The system is more flexible compared to the existing ones, since there is little wastage of water, time and energy,” Abdul said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/diploma-holder-in-vijayapura-develops-irrigation-device-to-optimise-water-use/articleshow/89232044.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

This has now led to the public demanding GPS enabled vehicles for garbage collection across the twin cities.Several citizens have caught the civic workers scanning the GPS machine before the arrival of the vehicle. They say that the pourakarmikas have been instructed by their contractor to do so.Dr C G Zalaki, a resident in Lingaraj Nagar, told TOI that he has observed such scanning by pourakarmikas several times. “When I caught them red-handed, they said the vehicle will arrive later, but it did not make it on that day. So, we have requested HDMC authorities to deploy GPS-enabled vehicles. But they are turning a deaf ear to our requests,” he added.Harshavardhan Sheelavant, an environmentalist in Dharwad, shared that one such incident — a pourakarmika scanning the machine before the arrival of the vehicle — was grabbed by a CCTV camera at Manjunathapura in Malamaddi, Dharwad. “When a worker scanned the machine at 8am and the vehicle failed to arrive, we raised a complaint on social media. Subsequently, the vehicle arrived by 11.45 am. Civic workers said that they were pushed on duty at a supermarket where DC and HDMC commissioner were on rounds on January 25. Earlier, we had complained about this issue to HDMC, but the staff had ruled out our grievance claiming that the vehicle had collected the garbage in our area,” he explained.Mahesh Gadag, a faculty at private college in Vidyanagar, Hubballi, said the pourakarmikas are taking advantage of the busy schedules of citizens. “When both husband and wife work, they can’t wait for garbage collection vehicle to arrive every morning. As they don’t arrive at a specific time, we keep our bins out and go to work. When we return, garbage remains there. Meanwhile, HDMC records garbage collection from our area despite not collecting the same. Some workers also say they have small vehicles and that they are already full, and that they will return next day. In some places, they collect garbage on alternative days and they openly say they are instructed to do so by their contractor,” he added.HDMC commissioner Dr Gopal Krishna B said that he is unaware of such incidents. “We will verify the facts from our control room and issue show-cause notice to the contractors/ staff concerned. If allegations are proved, we will take appropriate action against them. Meanwhile, we request public to file their grievance with control room,” he appealed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/doorstep-collection-of-waste-remains-on-paper-in-twin-cities/articleshow/89232046.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

The event was held jointly by Belagavi airport and a private company, M/S Expert Valves India Private Limited run by Vinyak Lokur. The airport director, Rajesh Kumar Maurya, said he agreed to hold the havan after he saw a video that gave scientific validation to the impact of Agnihotra homa. “This homa has been traditionally conducted to purify, heal and energise space,” he said.On Saturday evening about 20 men and women, mostly educated entrepreneurs, arrived at the airport with copper containers, cow dung, unpolished rice grains and other materials to conduct the ritual. They sat in straight lines on opposite sides and kickstarted the havan. Maurya said the cow dung and two pinches of unpolished rice grains are put inside a copper container and light fire to the mix that billows smoke. “Many see these rituals in different perspectives, but when it was proposed to me with a video, I viewed it with a scientific eye. This purifies air,” he claimed. The mass homa was conducted at the entrance of the airport. Maurya further said Vinayak Lokur is an educated man and he has been doing this homa in many places for the past ten years. Every religion has its own methods of healing the environment. For instance the Christians do through burning candles and Hindus do through havan and bangging gongs. It may be recalled that Belagavi South MLA Abhay Patil, a few months back, organised mass Agnihotra in the city wards along with his supporters when there were Covid restrictions. He claimed that this havan would clean air and keep Covid at bay. The district administration later filed a case against the organisers for violating Covid guidelines by gathering people.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/agnihotra-homa-at-belagavi-airport-to-purify-air/articleshow/89232050.cms||Shreyas HS
---||Hubballi||Fading Modi script delays legal proceedings||Dharwad: ‘Modi’ is a medieval script that is a veritable medley of languages, containing as it does words of Marathi, Parsi, Arabic and Kannada. The script came into use when the Dharwad, Vijayapura, Belagavi and Uttara Kannada, was under the dominion of the Peshwas of Pune. However, the script continued to be used for centuries after the region passed out of the Peshwas’ fiefdom, and many records pertaining to property were written in the Modi script. Unfortunately, over the years, the number of people who could read this script has been declining, resulting in many issues remaining in litigation. Prof Mangesh Yashwant Sawant, an expert in deciphering the Modi script, said: “There are thousands of records in the Karnatak Jamav section of Pune archives, the Peshwa Daftar, that were preserved by the Inam Commission. A study of these documents will shed more light on political, economic and cultural history of medieval Karnataka.”For Sawant, learning the Modi script was a necessity. As a PhD student at Pune University, writing his dissertation on ‘Dharwad Under Peshwa Rule’ with Prof KN Chitnis for his guide, Sawant was finding it difficult to extract relevant information owing to his lack of knowledge of the Modi script. “I learnt Modi script from Prof Chitnis and Prof MR Kulkarni,” said Sawant.The academic offered his knowledge to assist farmers, lawyers, officials in the revenue department and fellow researchers, by translating Modi script to Kannada. Among the unique aspects of the script, Sawant pointed out, was the conspicuous absence of a space separating two words. “The letters are written in a cursive form, and the lack of space makes it difficult to read. Property documents of various Lingayat mutts, mosques, temples, in addition to those concerning hereditary property, were written using the Modi script. There is a need to train people in reading this script to help bring many legal disputes to an end,” Prof Sawant said.Sawant has notaries authorise documents he has translated from Modi script to Kannda. In addition to helping farmers get ‘K’ and ‘D’ uttar free of cost, he has translated many Kaifiyats in dargahs and mosques to Kannada.The Dharwad-based Karnatak Historical Research Society (KHRS), which is engaged in preserving intact the linguistic bonds with the past, is planning to conduct three-day training workshops to teach people and officials in government departments to decipher the ‘Modi’ script. KHRS chairman Giridhar Kinhal said that they would start the sessions once 25 people signed up for the workshop. Those interested can contact: +919880859784; GiridharKinhal@Gmail.ComKarnatak University is also contemplating offering a one-year diploma in Modi script to educate the younger generation about the heritage of the language, and train themin reading it.A script with a rich historyThe Modi script was purportedly first developed by Hemadpant, an administrator in the court of Ramadev Rao, the last monarch of the Yadav Dynasty (1187-1318), which ruled from Devgiri. However, the use of the script in administration, however, is attributed to Balaji Avaji Chitnis, a minister in Chhatrapti Shivaji’s durbar. The Peshwas, who succeeded Shivaji, used the script in their official dispatches, and it was used in the districts of North Karnataka that passed into the dominion of the Martha kingdom.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/fading-modi-script-delays-legal-proceedings/articleshow/89232051.cms||---

Nineteen victims were fully vaccinated and five had taken the first dose only. The status of two others was not known. Health experts said the deaths, 20 were men, were mainly due to risk factors and full/partial vaccination could not offer protection against severe Covid. Most of them had underlying conditions —hypertension and diabetes the most common. “There were claims that vaccination protects against the severity of the illness and reduces hospitalisation. However, those who’s immunity is suppressed have still been affected and died due to the underlying disease rather than the virus per se,” said a public health expert. He said, “That is why it is advised that such patients should avoid unnecessary exposure and take precautions.” “There have been many studies which have shown that the deaths have occurred in such immunocompromised patients as the virus accelerated the progression of their existing disease,” said another public health expert. The first death was reported on January 5, a 72-year-old woman having coronary artery disease, diabetes and hypertension. She was fully vaccinated against the virus. The oldest victim was a 92-year-old man from Sector 21. He had acute respiratory distress syndrome, hypertension and heart disease. He was also completely vaccinated. The youngest victim was a 11-month-old baby girl from Dhanas. She had a history of seizures.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/of-39-covid-deaths-in-jan-13-were-not-vaccinated/articleshow/89232053.cms||Shimona Kanwar

In 2019, the figure was 1,900 and 2,064 in in 2020. Last year, 3,766 old vehicles of those areas were given NOCs.“The RLA charges tax on the insurance value of these vehicles while giving the NOCs. The charges are 6% of the total insurance value for vehicles costing less than Rs 20 lakh and 8% for those above Rs 20 lakh. Besides, the authority also charges fee for transfer and issuing smart card,” sources said.Sources said the entire exercise is hassle-free, with special windows and counters put up in the RLA building for these works. The transfer work or issuing of NOC is hardly a task. People can easily get their works done, sources added.

Hopefully, in coming days, a decision will be taken in this regard,” an official said.All the nine nursing home sites are located in prime locations of southern sectors, according to records. Since southern sectors are lacking nursing homes, these sites could provide major benefit to residents. They are quite spacious, making the administration confident of drawing a good competition among biddersFour of the nine sites are in Sector 51, two each in sectors 33-C and 46 and one in Sector 44 C. The southern part of the city is thickly populated and residents have to go to other places or neighbouring areas for health care. The auction of the sites will benefit thousands, sources said. The sites are lying vacant for over a decade. As per record, the UT had earmarked total 16 nursing sites across the city, out of which only seven were auctioned.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/9-nursing-home-sites-yet-to-be-auctioned-leasehold-the-barrier/articleshow/89232057.cms||Deepak Yadav

A total of 28 juveniles are lodged in juvenile home in Sector 25. Out of them, 13 were convicted by the juvenile justice board. When they attain the age of 18, they will be shifted to Burail jail to finish their remaining term. Data showed 159 children were nabbed in 104 cases in 2017, 137 in 84 cases in 2018 and 208 in 117 cases in 2019. In 2020, the outbreak of Covid-19 and subsequent lockdowns brought the arrests down to 78 in 50 cases. Last year, 83 children were arrested in 54 cases. Five minors have already been arrested in two cases of theft and assault in the first month of this year so far. Most of the accused were involved in thefts, burglaries, snatchings, vehicle lifting and robberies. Recently, the Manimajra police had arrested four juveniles in a theft case of Rs 17 lakh. Interestingly, the son and nephew of the victim were among the accused. The complainant’s son had stolen Rs 17 lakh from a bed-box in his house to buy IDs for online games like “Free Fire”, “PUBG”, and “Asphalt 9, cops had said. The boy, his cousin and other two juveniles had allegedly spent Rs 7 lakh on buying iPhones, shopping and travelling by air to Delhi and Patna. Police had recovered Rs 10 lakh from the children. Another sensational case in which a juvenile was involved had come to light in March 2021. The police had arrested a 12-year-old boy for allegedly murdering, kidnapping and raping a minor girl in Hallomajra. On its part, police have started schemes to rehabilitate juveniles. In a first of its kind initiative by former DGP Sanjay Baniwal, a skill development programme under “Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana” had begun in the city. Under the programme, police have identified thousands of children involved in petty crime or drug abuse and were at high risk of getting involved in criminal activities. Police have been imparting training under vocational courses like beauty and wellness, general duty hospital, retail store and food and beverage assistance. Cops said the skill development programme would help reduce unemployment faced by teenagers and stop them from taking the route of crime.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/as-covid-came-juvenile-crime-went-down/articleshow/89232059.cms||Pawan Tiwari

In letters to PU officials, students have pressed the demand for opening of the campus from February 1. They have pointed out that two years of online classes has led to great educational loss. The university was closed during the Covid lockdown. When the first wave abated, a few researchers came back to the university but no official announcement was made. This was followed by the devastating second wave when studies were conducted online. Many students, particularly those in remote places suffered as they had issues with equipment and internet connectivity. All educational institutions opened after the second wave but PU did not open completely. Only research scholars and PG final year students were called. Since the third wave is not that lethal and most educational institutions are opening from Fenruary 1, students want the varsity to open too. In their letter demanding reopening of the university after the semester exams, they said that prolonged online classes would hamper their employability. According to them, recruiting companies would prefer students who had attended offline classes. They also pointed out that they were unable to perform experiments, which were vital for their education, in online classes.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/pu-students-want-varsity-to-open-write-to-officials/articleshow/89232064.cms||---

Most of the carts belonged to people from the minority community.  According to the complaint lodged by Hanif Herja, a 60-year-old egg joint owner, around 8-10 people armed with pipes and sticks came on five bikes and started vandalizing the carts on Morbi Road. They did not speak anything with the owners and simply started damaging and overturning the egg carts, alleged Herja. It is alleged that one of the egg cart owners was also thrashed by the group, while one cart caught fire after the primus overturned. The egg carts were lined up near Swaminarayan bridge on Morbi Road. Officials of B-division police station said that even though no reason has been stated for the vandalism, it is strongly believed to be the fall-out of the Dhandhuka incident. Police inspector MB Osura said CCTV footage is being scanned to identify and arrest the accused persons. “There seems to be no other reason for this sudden vandalism of egg carts that have been operating for several years in the area,” sources in the police said. On Friday night too, groups of people from two religions clashed in a garden over a 'controversial' Instagram post put up by a man from the majority community. It is alleged that Imtiyaz Rathod and Salim Dal had asked Vinay Dodia to delete the post. It was decided that they would meet at Jilla Garden in the city to sort out the issue. However, when the groups met there, there was a bitter altercation which led to a scuffle but all escaped after a police patrolling van reached there. Two bikes were also vandalized outside the garden. Police arrested 12 people from both faiths following a complaint lodged by Rana, who lives in Hudco Quarters on Kothariya Road. Those arrested included Salim Dal, Imtiyaz Rathod, Mohammed Ali Dasadiya, Jayraj Gadhvi, Ravi Chavadiya, Vinay Dodia, Hardik Mewada, Satyajit Rana, Uday Chavda. Two minors were also detained.

---||Srinagar||Wanted JeM commander among 5 terrorists killed||Srinagar: Pakistan-based outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed's "wanted" south Kashmir commander Zahid Manzoor Wani was among five terrorists killed in twin gunfights with security forces in Pulwama and Budgam on Sunday, making him the eighth armed infiltrator from across the border to be shot dead in J&K since January 1. Wani's killing along with three associates at Naira in Pulwama, and a Lashkar-e-Taiba recruit in the day's other encounter at Budgam's Charar-e-Shareef, led security forces to declare they were on track to get the number of active terrorists in the Valley down to under 100 this year. The Jaish commander, known to be an expert in making improvised explosive devices, was holed up in a house with a couple of aides when a joint squad of the police, Army and CRPF cordoned off the area. The son of the house owner, later identified as a "hybrid terrorist" affiliated to JeM, joined Wani and his aides in firing at the advancing team."In the initial assault by our forces, three terrorists were killed. We subsequently confirmed the presence of a fourth terrorist and gunned him down. He turned out to be JeM's south Kashmir chief," Lt Gen Prashant Srivastava, GOC of the Army's Victor Force, said at a joint presser with IGP Vijay Kumar at Balapur in Shopian.Wani had been active in J&K since 2017 and masterminded multiple attacks on security forces and civilians. His brother, also a terrorist, was captured sometime ago and is in jail. "Wani being eliminated is a big success for counter-terrorism forces in Kashmir," Lt Gen Srivastava said.IGP Kumar said the house owner’s slain son, Inayat Ahmed, had been given the opportunity to surrender, but he chose to attack the search team. Inayat's role as a so-called hybrid terrorist, a relatively new challenge for security forces in Kashmir, was to sporadically participate in terror activities. Unlike listed terrorists whose identities are known, hybrid terrorists function as faceless members of the network and are deployed just once or twice, making them hard to track. The strategy to bring down the number of active terrorists to below 100 by the end of the year involves not just operations, but also a concerted campaign to reduce local recruitment by terror outfits. Besides planning and executing terror attacks, slain Jaish commander Wani had been a headache for forces because of his sustained recruitment drive in south Kashmir.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/srinagar/wanted-jem-commander-among-5-terrorists-killed/articleshow/89232071.cms||---

The forces immediately evacuated the civilians in and around the house and ensured that they were sent to a safe distance.The forces tightened the cordon around the house which forced the terrorists to start firing at the forces to escape from the location.While resorting to heavy firing in an attempt to break the cordon, the terrorists came in direct line of fire with Army and Garud personnel which resulted in heavy gunfight from both sides. In this process Squadron Leader Sandeep Jhanjaria of the Garud Special Forces was hit by a volley of fire and was hit with two bullets on his chest and left arm, sources added. Despite the injury, the officer continued engaging the terrorists till all the three fleeing militants were eliminated, sources said.While the troops were trying to look for more terrorists in the house after eliminating the three, one of the terrorists hiding there came out and started firing on the Garud troops party in which Corporal Anand was hit by a bullet.

Dump site in the hilly terrain is overflowing and contaminating water body, which is a source of irrigation. The applicant relied upon photographs and letters addressed to the authorities pointing out the above deficiencies. The principal secretary (urban development) had submitted a report to the tribunal on December 11 last year informing about the steps taken by the Hamirpur municipal council regarding execution of work at plant/project site at Dughneri to address the issue of pollution.Hearing the matter on January 27, the NGT bench headed by judicial member Sudhir Agarwal referring to different reports filed from time to time said from the above reports, the tribunal finds that except for some minor steps like construction of retaining wall, raising of fencing, covering of waste processing facility by net and storm water drain to avoid contamination of water, no other action has been taken particularly in respect to the treatment as also the waste already collected and lying on various spots which is also evident from the photographs placed before the tribunal in the above reports.“This superficial and shallow exercise does not amount to effective steps for compliance of the environmental norms for preservation and protection of environment and prevention of pollution,” the tribunal said, adding that this is really unfortunate that after giving repeated opportunity what has come before it is only a casual compliance on certain aspects without any effective measures taken for prevention of pollution in the area concerned. The tribunal said in these facts and circumstances, it find it appropriate to direct the principal secretary, urban development, and executive officer, municipal council, Hamirpur, to appear before the tribunal in virtual mode on the next date of hearing on March 4.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/shimla/ngt-summons-principal-secy-over-dughneri-pollution/articleshow/89232073.cms||Anand Bodh

But the announcement to hold back the DA to them had come as a shock. The additional registrar for cooperative societies, in his communication to regional joint registrars, has cited the GO of the co-operation, food and consumer protection department on Feb 22, 2021, where only a 14% hike in basic salary has been mentioned and nothing about the DA. Hence, he had asked the regional registrars to put the DA on hold. But, there is a recommendation by the committee which says DA can be given. If the required changes had been made when the chief minister announced in September that a DA hike would be given to government employees from January 1, the PDS workers would also have got their DA by now. The chief minister should intervene in the matter and ensure that these workers get their dues without delay, he said. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/ops-asks-govt-to-release-da-for-pds-staff/articleshow/89232079.cms||---

A land parcel measuring 10.9 acres in Kavattaiyanpatti village near Melur belongs to Elanthaikarai Ayyanar temple. In 2006, three temple trustees sold the property to Palanichamy. Though its market value was more than Rs 1.5 crore, the property was sold only for Rs 1.57lakh. In 2012, M Gopalakrishnan lodged a complaint alleging fabrication of documents, forgery, cheating and conspiracy and requested the police to investigate. Based on the complaint, Melavalavu police registered a case against nine people under various sections of IPC and, after investigation, filed a final report in 2013. Before framing the charges, the accused people filed a petition before Melur judicial magistrate (JM) court in 2015 seeking their discharge claiming that there is no material to proceed against them for the alleged offences. The JM court allowed the petition and discharged the accused holding that the dispute is purely civil in nature. When the police filed a revision petition, Madurai I additional sessions court in 2016 confirmed the Melur JM court’s order. The Melur deputy superintendent of police had filed the present petition before HC Madurai bench in 2017, seeking to set aside the trial court orders. Justice G Jayachandran observed that the courts below had considered the facts on a wrong premise that the case is civil in nature and no criminal offence was committed despite the fact that the village property has been sold by people who were only managers and not owners of the property. “If any cognizable offence is brought to the knowledge of the police, it is their responsibility and duty to investigate and file a final report. At times, the villagers may be intimidated or threatened by powerful persons and or for any other reasons, they may not set the law into motion. In such circumstances, the court shall not find fault with the law enforcing agency, which has taken up the investigation of a cognizable offence,” the judge observed. When public property is converted into a private property by false document to exploit natural resources, the courts cannot turn a Nelson’s eye and sit on hyper technicalities, give seal of approval and allow illegality to continue, observed the judge. “The court in a discharge petition cannot make a roving enquiry and conduct a mini trial, which the courts below have unfortunately done in this case. Whether it is done due to ignorance of law or for extraneous consideration, is not the concern of this court for disposing of the petition,” observed the judge. Since the materials placed by the prosecution make out a prima facie case of criminal offence of conspiracy, forgery, breach of trust and cheating, the judge directed the trial court to frame appropriate charges against the nine people.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/frame-charges-against-nine-for-usurping-temple-land-high-court/articleshow/89232083.cms||Kaushik Kannan

Students are relieved that the exams will finally be conducted smoothly without further delays so that classes for the next semester can be started. “We were nervous when it was announced that colleges will be reopened for offline classes from February but thankfully the exams are to be held in online mode. We cannot afford any more delays and the shift to a sudden offline exam would have been off-putting for us. Later, if offline classes are conducted again we can write the next semester exams in offline mode,” said S Visalakshi, a final year student at an arts and sciences college in Madurai. Colleges and universities, including Madurai Kamaraj University, have already made preparations for holding the online exams. Dr D Pandiaraja, principal, Thiagarajar College of Arts and Science, said that online exams will be held as proctored online exams. “Students will be writing their exams from their homes. However, they will have to write the exam while switching on video throughout the exam. An invigilator will be monitoring and students have to upload their answer scripts online. The original hard copies of the answer scripts will also be allowed to be sent by post,” he added. However, in most colleges online exams are likely to be held with little or no proper supervision or monitoring. Students have to download question papers once the exam commences and upload the answer scripts after completing it within the given time or send by post. “Online exams are an eye wash and lacks quality. If they are to be conducted in future, a proper and fair system must be created,” said an assistant professor. M Nagarajan, general secretary, MUTA, said it is good for students this time that there is no confusion by sudden change to offline exams. “Though quality is a major issue in offline exams, students must first have enough offline classes to come out of the mindset of online exams and get back normalcy. Final semester exams, if conducted offline, will be challenging for students,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/madurai-colleges-gear-up-to-hold-semester-exams-online-again/articleshow/89232084.cms||---
---||Madurai||Madurai: Schools to reopen in a staggered manner||MADURAI: With the government allowing reopening of schools from February 1 and Covid-19 cases yet to subside, schools are cautiously gearing up to reopen in a staggered manner. At the same time, parents and students are also keen that offline classes resume as they don’t want another long break. “Schools are planning as per their convenience for reopening on rotational basis to ensure that social distancing is maintained depending on the student strength. Online and offline classes may also be shuffled through the week. It is welcome that the government has allowed schools the freedom to decide. We expect at least 70%-80% attendance,” said Senthilnathan M, president, Private Schools Correspondents’ Confederation. Almost all schools are likely to start offline classes even for two or three days a week despite online classes being allowed to continue. “Students cannot be once again forced to be at home, so we will do our best to ensure Covid-19 safety protocols. We have also informed parents that if they find that their child is sick they must not come to school. Vaccinating all children aged between 15-18 years is a welcome difference this time. However, we still fear children may catch Covid-19 on travel through public transport,” said the headmaster of a government aided higher secondary school in Madurai. Meanwhile, parents feel the children are better protected from Covid-19 during this wave. “This is the first time schools are being allowed to reopen even though Covid-19 cases haven’t subsided. There is some anxiousness, but children miss school too much and cannot forever be at home. Elders at home are all vaccinated including for the precaution dose, so they are also better protected even if children may be asymptomatic carriers,” said J Shyamala Devi, mother of two children who attend a government aided school.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/schools-to-reopen-in-a-staggered-manner/articleshow/89232086.cms||---

The popular vegetable had cost over Rs 100 a kilogram a few weeks ago. Beautiful red and ripe tomatoes have been flooding the market with the winter season starting to recede and the climate turning hotter. President of Mattuthavani central vegetable market P S Murugan said that the daily supply which was just 50 loads a week ago has doubled now. The wedding season has come to an end and so have festivals, so there is no demand. “This is the time when hotels can make good money as not just tomatoes, all vegetables have become cheap,” he said. K Shanmugapriya of Anna Nagar said tomatoes had become like gold in December and she had been keeping them covered in rock salt to ensure they did not get spoiled. ``Now that there is plenty of it and my family loves tomato rice, we make it thrice a week,’’ she said. Tomatoes usually come in lorry loads to the market, each bringing about 400 boxes of 15 kg each. Now, nearly 70 tonnes of tomatoes have started arriving, which was expected to go up in the coming days. They come from Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and districts like Dindigul and Theni in the state. Venkateswaran, a vendor, said that wastage was also high as many of the tomatoes come in ripe condition. “Lot of them would be dumped in the garbage. It would be good if something is done in markets to process or store ripe tomatoes,” he said. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/tomato-price-dips-to-10-a-kg-wholesale-in-madurai/articleshow/89232089.cms||---

A division bench of Justices Pushpa Sathyanarayana and S Srimathy was hearing the plea moved by Maamallan Tha Kanagamuthu, state coordinator of Mannin Mainthar Iyakkam, from Theni district.The petitioner stated that there are 21 municipal corporations, 138 municipalities and 490 town panchayats in the state and the government had passed three GOs pertaining to the reservation of seats in urban local bodies. According to the GO, mayor posts in Chennai, Avadi and Tambaram corporations are reserved for SC candidates and all three corporations are in and around Chennai. However, he stated that no such reservation was made for the corporations situated in other parts of the state.He stated that among the total 138 municipalities, only 21 seats of chairperson were reserved for SC/ST candidates instead of 26 according to the reservation policy. Similarly, only 88 seats out of the 490 town panchayats have been reserved for SC/ST candidates when 93 should have been set apart for them according to the policy. Hence, the petitioner moved HC Madurai bench challenging the three government orders and sought to issue fresh GOs in tune with the reservation policy for SC/ST candidates in urban local bodies.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/plea-in-hc-to-follow-sc/st-quota-policy-properly-in-civic-poll/articleshow/89232091.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Gadchiroli and Yavatmal look to fast track developments under Centre’s Aspirational Districts Scheme||Nagpur: Gadchiroli and Yavatmal districts of Vidarbha region hope to make rapid progress in various parameters under the Central government’s scheme to fast track development in rural areas. Collectors of both districts were part of a video conference chaired by PM Narendra Modi in which he talked about the Central government’s ‘Aspirational Districts Scheme’ and other projects for scaling up district-level basic facilities. Gadchiroli, which was chosen as an aspirational district in 2018 itself, has successfully implemented projects like Educate Gadchiroli, Fulora (related to education) and is in final stages of starting the first-ever IIT coaching centre for local kids. Being part of the aspirational districts list ensures that these district receive funds for projects faster and that they maximize benefit from both state and Central schemes. The Niti Ayog is the coordinating body for such districts. Gadchiroli district collector Sanjay Meena is now awaiting nod for a proposal which involves capacity building for gram sabhas with regards to community forest rights (CFR) granted to them. The Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006, recognizes the rights of the forest-dwelling tribal communities and other traditional forest dwellers to forest resources on which these communities were dependent for a variety of needs, including livelihood, habitation and other socio-cultural needs. CFR also includes the right to ‘regenerate or conserve or manage any community forest resource for sustainable use’. “There are 1,432 gram sabhas that have been granted CFR. We want to ensure capacity building initiatives for all these gram sabhas so that they are aware of the backward and forward integration that’s aligned to their CFR. For example if one gram sabha has been allotted 50 hectares of land, they must have all the knowledge required to develop that land in a sustainable manner which means getting maximum yield for the community’s benefit,” said Meena. In Gadchiroli, almost 5 lakh hectares land is now under CFR. For this, Gondwana University has been roped in as a knowledge partner. “They will prepare the literature/curriculum on how to train locals. Even if 10 people from each gram sabha can be imparted the training, it will bring about a big change,” said Meena. Yavatmal collector Amol Yedge too was part of the virtual meet with PM Modi and is now looking forward to implementing projects focussed on school education. “Our district has been chosen specifically by the school education and literacy department wherein the focus will be on qualitative education. In the next 15-20 days we will receive guidelines on how these projects are to be implemented,” said Yedge. With almost the entire part of the district under ‘rural’ tag, Yedge has his task cut out. “The geographical area is vast and base is rural. With this project we look forward to improving quality of education, infrastructure and other parameters which will come under the key performance indicators,” said Yedge.  PLAN IN PLACE * Gadchiroli part of centre’s Aspirational District Scheme launched in 2018 to fast track development in rural areas * Already district implemented innovative education projects which benefited thousands of tribal students in remote villages * Gadchiroli in final stages of starting first-ever government-run residential IIT coaching centre * Yavatmal chosen under separate scheme by Centre’s school education and literacy department * In February, Yavatmal will receive guidelines on how to improve infrastructure in schools * Also, guidelines for providing qualitative education * Yavatmal making steady progress in improving basic infrastructure, but now can accelerate projects in education field||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/gadchiroli-and-yavatmal-look-to-fast-track-developments-under-centres-aspirational-districts-scheme/articleshow/89230045.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

The answer to this may be hidden in the make-up of their gut microbiota, a new study published online in the journal Gut suggests. In the study, scientists tracked changes in the gut microbiome — the trillions of bacteria, fungi and other microbes that inhabit the digestive tract — of 106 patients with varying degrees of Covid severity by analysing their stool samples and compared them with the composition of the gut microbiome of a group of 68 people who didn’t have Covid. They found that among the bacteria species found in patients with long Covid, 28 were reduced and 14 were enriched both at hospital admission and at three and six months after discharge. At six months, patients with long Covid had significantly fewer ‘friendly’ F. prausnitzii, and Blautia obeum and a greater abundance of ‘unfriendly’ Ruminococcus gnavus andBacteroides vulgatus than people who hadn’t had Covid. On the other hand, the gut microbiome of those who didn’t develop long Covid showed only 25 changes in bacteria species at hospital admission, and this recovered completely after six months, the study led by professor Siew NG of The Chinese University of Hong Kong found. Dr S K Sarin, noted gastroenterologist and vice-chancellor of the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, told TOI that the study findings had the potential to alter the management protocols for long Covid. “Our body has trillions of microbes, including bacteria, viruses and fungus. They normally live in symbiosis with the body. This study shows external inserts like the Covid virus, which also multiplies in the cells of the intestine, can cause dysbiosis or imbalance in the gut microbiota, leading to an increased presence of disease-causing or pathogenic bacteria and a relative reduction in the presence of good bacteria, resulting in long-lasting side-effects,” he said. Dr Sarin said on the basis of this theory, one could provide good bacteria in the form of probiotics to correct the imbalance. Dr Randhir Sud, chairman, Institute of Digestive and Hepatobiliary Sciences, Medanta – The Medicity, said there were close to 38 trillion bacteria, viruses and fungi in human intestines that influenced various metabolic and immune functions of the human body. “We now realise that gut microbe composition is not the same at all and plays an important role in our susceptibility to a disease. For Covid too, this is possible and people with certain gut microbial composition may be susceptible to severe disease or long Covid,” he said. Dr Sud said it was possible to alter this composition in the short term with probiotics and certain gut-specific antibacterial drugs, but whether that would help in prevention of long Covid was not known yet. Dr Ishi Khosla, a clinical nutritionist, said people who were recovering from Covid should be advised to eat healthy, so that the inflammation caused by the infection in the gut could be healed. “It may be good to add probiotics or other supplements with special focus on providing a fertile ground for the growth of the good bacteria,” Dr Khosla said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/how-gut-feeling-may-hit-covid-recovery/articleshow/89230041.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

Two criminals involved in the crime – Ravi Shanker Kumar and Rohit Kumar alias Bittu – were earlier arrested by the special investigation team formed under the leadership of city SP (central) Ambrish Rahul. The three criminals arrested on Sunday were identified as Sahil Verma alias Appu, Deepak Gupta and Manoranjan Kumar. Two criminals, however, are still at large. The SP said Ravi was arrested on the same day of the incident from Kadamkuan with a bag, a knife and a live cartridge. “During interrogation, Ravi was continuously giving vague information about his other associates. With the help of intelligence inputs, we came to know that Ravi is an aide of Bittu, who was jailed on several occasions in the past in robbery, murder, arms act and dacoity cases. The police gathered information about Bittu and succeeded in arresting him,” Rahul said. He added, “A country-made pistol and a live cartridge were recovered from Bittu. During interrogation, he revealed that seven criminals were involved in the crime. Four people had gone to the apartment. A worker of Surendra’s sweetmeat shop and Sahil did the lining work. The worker had also made the video of Dev Kutir available to the robbers,” the SP said, adding police have recovered Rs 25,000 of the looted money from the criminals. The criminals had entered Surendra’s flat on the third floor and held his wife, Sapna Mittal, and son hostage at gunpoint while looting the cash and valuables.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/robbery-at-traders-house-3-more-held/articleshow/89232094.cms||Faryal Rumi

We are ready to contest all the seats,” Congress legislature party leader Ajit Sharma said on Sunday. Sharma said Congress state president Madan Mohan Jha, party’s Rajya Sabha MP Akhilesh Prasad Singh and he himself were supposed to discuss the issue with RJD national president Lalu Prasad on the instruction of their top leadership. “Akhilesh ji had called Lalu ji on Friday morning and the latter said since Tejashwi had returned (from abroad), he will be discussing the seat-sharing formula with him,” said Sharma, adding that later in the evening he heard Tejashwi’s statement through the media to contest all seats alone. Jha told the mediapersons that Congress has yet not got any official statement from RJD on seat-sharing and whatever he heard was through the media. Congress MLC Prem Chandra Mishra, however, expressed his anger over the way Tejashwi had been behaving and reminded the RJD of the byelection results on two assembly seats. In that election, too, RJD had declared its candidates from both Tarapur and Kusheshwar Asthan constituencies without consulting the Congress and lost both the seats to JD(U). On the other hand, RJD’s state spokesperson Mritunjay Tiwari advised Congress to realise the truth, rather than daydreaming. “Our leader has already taken the decision and Congress should not weaken the Mahagatbandhan,” said Tiwari, blaming Congress for their defeat in the assembly byelections. He said the seats were not like Satyanarain Puja ‘prasad’ to be distributed anyhow to all.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/cong-yet-not-decided-on-contesting-council-polls/articleshow/89232097.cms||Sheezan Nezami

It also announced to contest all 24 seats on its own. VIP national president Mukesh Sahani slammed the BJP-JD(U) combine for not sparing even a single council seat for his party. Sahani, who is also a cabinet minister in the Nitish Kumar-led coalition government, said, “The government in Bihar stands because of Manjhi and Sahani. The BJP and JD(U) think they’re powerful and have taken the right decision. This is like ‘Hitlershahi’.” Sahni was referring to the crucial support provided by his party and the former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi-led Hindustani Awam Morcha-Secular (HAM-S) to the Nitish-led coalition government. Currently, the VIP has three MLAs and HAM-S four in Bihar. The Nitish government has the support of 127 MLAs. It has the support of only five more MLAs than the majority mark of 122 in the 243-member House. If Manjhi and Sahani withdraw the support of their seven MLAs, the coalition government may fall in trouble. The BJP and JD(U) had reached an amicable seat-sharing formula for the council polls on Saturday. As per the agreement, the BJP will contest 12 seats, JD(U) 11 seats and the remaining one seat has gone to the kitty of Union minister Pashupati Kumar Paras-led Rashtriya Lok Janshakti Party (RLJP). “Some people think that Nishads are their ‘jagirs’. But I am a son of Nishad. I have reached this level through the path of struggle and I will continue to struggle,” Sahani said. He added the VIP would launch its Jharkhand unit on March 11 on the occasion of martyrdom day of Jubba Sahni. “We are working to strengthen the organization in Jharkhand,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/its-hitlershahi-of-jdu-bjp-sahani-on-seat-refusal/articleshow/89232099.cms||Madan Kumar

Saraswati puja may be around the corner, but sculptors in Patna are still awaiting orders for idols. Amid Covid, craftsmen are staring at huge losses and an uncertain future. With barely 5-6 days left for the puja, the artisans have reduced the prices of idols to find buyers. Artisan Anand Murthywala, while pointing to a huge pile of unsold idols on Bailey Road, said he would have booked more than 70% of idols by this time of the year. “As the government has banned mass congregation and holding of community pujas, we are not getting orders for the idols. We get orders for large idols mainly from religious outfits, groups, associations and organisations. However, since mass gathering is prohibited, they are not placing orders,” he added. Ranjeet Sah, another artisan near Bans Ghat, was seen making calls to his regular customers and requesting them to buy the idols. “I have reduced the prices by up to Rs 2,800 depending on the size of idols. As people are not allowed to install idols at public places, I have not got any order yet. I have created over 100 large idols,” he said. Krishna Singh, another artisan putting up a makeshift shop near Kadamkuan, said only three people have bought small Saraswati idols from him. “In view of the restrictions, I avoided making large idols this time. The situation was better last year in spite of the pandemic,” he said. Gaurav Kumar, who was seen buying a small Saraswati idol at Kurji, said, “I will perform puja at home. It is a tradition in my home that I follow. We offer prayers and celebrate the festival at home.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/idol-makers-in-city-anxious-as-saraswati-puja-nears/articleshow/89232105.cms||Faryal Rumi

Bihar has also been spending more money on this sector for the opening of new health institutes, procurement of equipment and recruitment and training of healthcare workers. Experts say a vast change is being seen in the availability of oxygen and ICU beds. At present, over 400 MT of oxygen can be generated from different pressure swing adsorption plants and cryogenic tanks in Bihar, apart from different types of cylinders and concentrators available in the state. This is more than the peak equipment of the second wave when 377 MT was needed in the state on the day it had the highest number of Covid cases. State health society executive director Sanjay Kumar Singh said oxygen is available in graded manner up to primary health sector, which was not the case before Covid-19. Singh further said a large number of ventilators are now available and RT-PCR tests are done in each district. Talking about the increase in the number of suppliers of various equipment and other health related products, Singh said the price has come down. For instance, he said, a rapid antigen kit was available for Rs400 during the initial days of Covid-19 and the same is now available for Rs6 each. Doctors also feel the pandemic has brought some positive changes in the health sector. IMA senior vice-president Dr Ajay Kumar said the Covid-19 pandemic brought with it the importance of oxygen and ICU. However, he added, that the load on private sectors has still not reduced. “Not only quantitative changes, focus should also be on qualitative changes,” he said. Former state IMA president Dr Rajiv Ranjan Prasad said the Covid-19 pandemic also brought with it a sense of insecurity. “People used to think that they know everything. But even research scholars were puzzled. The best thing is that response time has reduced and real health education has percolated down to the grassroots level,” he said, citing the example of the use of oxymeter in every household and how people immediately go for proning in case of drop in oxygen level.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/cov-brings-focus-on-healthsector-infra-devpt-in-state/articleshow/89232107.cms||Sheezan Nezami

If you people elect our government this time also, then we will develop the state and the country at the speed of 5G,” said Singh during an interaction with voters at MB Cold storage in Rajepur town of Amritpur assembly constituency in Farrukhabad. “You all have to vote not only to form the government, but you have to write the fate of the country and the state,” he added. “Our Prime Minister Narendra Modi has constructed defence corridors in two states — Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. Now, not only ‘goli’ (bullet), but ‘gola’ (cannon ball) will also be manufactured in UP,” said Singh. Slamming SP’s ‘Lal Potli’ campaign, the defence minister said, “If you want to increase the power of the country and the state, then ‘Lal Potli’ will not work. Sacrifice has to be made to win the trust of the public, ‘Lal Potli’ will not work. I want to ask the SP why riots happened in its rule, why does ‘gundagardi’ (hooliganism) increase?” “You all have seen the Samajwadi Party government under which goons, crooks thrive, riots happen and there is no security of mothers and sisters. Things have changed under Yogi Adityanath ji. Law and order In UP has improved,” he added. The defence minister said Hindus, Parsis and Sikhs are persecuted in Pakistan because they are in minority there. “BJP has fulfilled the promise of giving citizenship to such people,” he asserted. Attacking SP, BSP and Congress, Singh said, “You all want Lakshmiji to come home. Lakshmi ji does not come on a cycle (SP), does not come even on an elephant (BSP) or hand (Congress). When Lakshmi ji comes, she comes riding on the lotus (BJP).” He said the performance of the BJP government is unmatched. “All governments, irrespective of the party, have been accused of corruption but there was no allegation of corruption against the BJP government. Rajiv Gandhi had accepted that if 100 paise are sent, only 16 paise reach the people. Modi and Yogi have ended this,” the minister said. “We paid about Rs 1.5 lakh crore to sugarcane farmers. When the Covid crisis started, we provided free food grains to 80 crore poor. We also gave free gas cylinders to poor families,” he said. “Samajwadi Party is indulging in polarisation politics. They have crossed all limits to get the vote of a particular community. We do not want votes on caste, creed, and religion. We seek votes only on justice and humanity,” Singh added. Where else would the Ram temple be built if not in India. Kashi Vishwanath Temple stands in a grand form. Somnath temple has been beautified and now an all-weather road is being built for Chardham Yatra. We also preserve the heritage of the country and cannot compromise with the ideals of our ancestors, he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/vote-bjp-back-to-power-in-up-get-develpment-at-5g-speed-rajnath/articleshow/89233895.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

BJP had lost Aryanagar and Sisamau to Samajwadi Party and Cantonment to Congress in 2017 elections. Of the total 52 seats in Kanpur-Bundelkhand region, the Opposition could wrest only five seats of which three were from Kanpur City.In a strategic move aimed at ensuring victory on these three seats, Kanpur BJP unit has requested Union home minister Amit Shah, BJP national president JP Nadda and defence minister Rajnath Singh to campaign in these seats.SP’s Amitabh Bajpai had defeated BJP’s Salil Vishnoi from Aryanagar, while from Sisamau BJP’s Suresh Awasthi had lost to Haji Irfan Solanki of SP.Sohail Akhtar Ansari of Congress had defeated BJP’s Raghunandan Bhadauria from Cantt assembly seat.Party stalwarts believe that despite a good support base in the city, loss on these seats indicates a mistake somewhere.On the basis of a survey, the party leadership has started gearing up to bring its star campaigners.District’s north president Sunil Bajaj and district’s south president Dr Veena Arya Patel have asked the party’s election committee to rope in the party’s star campaigners home minister Amit Shah, national president Jagat Prakash Nadda and defence minister Rajnath Singh in these three seat and other assembly constituencies for meetings and door-to-door campaigning.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kanpur/bjp-city-unit-demands-star-campaigners-to-ensure-win/articleshow/89232111.cms||---

Spread in an area of 500 hectare, the Saman Bird Sanctuary is a unique sanctuary located in the Mainpuri district including several smaller wetlands – an ideal habitat for water birds. It’s one among 467 IBA sites in the country (Important Bird & Biodiversity Area) designated by the Birdlife International having rich birdlife diversity and also is an important wintering site for many migrants. An increase in the number and species of migratory birds, which comes under IUCN threatened classification, was recorded during the recent Asian Waterbird Census (AWC)-2022, which was carried out at the newly designated Ramsar site — Saman Bird Sanctuary in Mainpuri — by a team of volunteers under the supervision of Roy. “This year, AWC started on January 2 and is still continuing. As far as species of water bird is concerned, it went up to 49 from last year’s count of 40. Similarly, there has been an increase in population of birds too. From last years count of 803, it went up to 2,281 including 5 species of threatened birds in comparison to 2021. It all happened due to partially improved habitat following recent unexpected winter rainfall while last year it was almost dried wetland habitat. Total 49 species of water bird includes 24 resident species and 25 migratory species,” Roy told TOI on Tuesday. Roy further said that water birds are one of the key indicators of wetland’s health and provide four kinds of ecological services. “Wetlands provide feeding, resting, roosting and foraging habitats for these charismatic species,” he said. “Among the winter migratory water threatened birds-Painted Stork, Black-headed Ibis, Black-tailed Godwit, Greater Spotted Eagle and Oriental Darter, were also recorded, which migrates from North Asia and Central Asia and it’s a very positive sign and a good news for bird lovers,” he said. AWC is citizen-science program which supports conservation of wetland and water birds globally and it is recognized annual water bird census and monitoring of the wetlands by the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC) as an important part of the National Action Plan for conservation of Migratory Birds & their habitats along the Central Asian Flyway (2018-2023).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kanpur/good-rainfall-in-january-led-to-rise-in-count-of-migratory-birds/articleshow/89232113.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

However, farmers from Sal, Kholpewadi, Nanora, Ladfe, Dodamarg, Kasarpal and surrounding areas are worried that this could destroy their crop of vegetables and chillies. Many farmers say that already, due to leakages in the canal, there is inadequate water supply for their crops. Various other problems are also hampering the flow of water such as several sub-canals that have been constructed at different places in Maharashtra and in Goa to facilitate direct water supply to farms. Overgrowth of bushes on the outer area of the sub-canals also makes it difficult to determine their exact condition, one farmer said. Many dairy farmers could also be affected by this problem. In a bid to resolve it, chief minister Pramod Sawant has approved a Rs 200 crore worth project which would include a permanent water pipeline from Tillari to Goa. However, work on the same is yet to commence.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/farmers-worry-for-crops-as-tillari-repairs-set-to-resume/articleshow/89230650.cms||TNN

On Sunday, the city registered less than 4,000 new cases — 3,674 — with the positivity rate further going down to 6.37%. However, there has not been much reduction in the number of daily fatalities in the city. Thirty more patients succumbed to the virus, taking the total death toll to 25,827. In the past one week there have been 177 deaths. Two weeks ago, Delhi’s positivity rate was as high as 30.6%, so far the highest since the pandemic began. The number of daily cases on January 13 was recorded highest — 28,867. Since then, there has been a drop in daily case load and it went below the 10,000 mark in 10 days. “There are many patients who were admitted at the hospital for some other chronic illness like cancer, kidney failure, ete. Some of them are contracting coronavirus during their course of treatment, while others are coming at a critical stage. But the reason for their death is not the virus, such comorbid patients won’t have survived even without Covid. These patients were kept in ICU or ventilators for two or three weeks before they succumbed,” said Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director, Lok Nayak Hospital. “The number of deaths cannot be solely attributed to Covid, there are several other factors involved this time. Unlike last wave when Covid was the prime cause for deaths, this time it is not,” said a senior doctor from AIIMS, who has been associated with Covid management. The number of patients admitted at hospitals have also come down. At present, there are 1,567 patients who are admitted in different city-based facilities, including those who are suspects. Of these around 300 are those coming from outside city.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/delhi-reports-3674-fresh-cases-positivity-rate-declines-to-6-37/articleshow/89230057.cms||---

Joshua, son of former deputy chief minister and long-serving Mapusa MLA Francis D’Souza, edged out Congress candidate Sudhir Kandolkar in the 2019 byelection, necessitated after his father passed away. Joshua and Kandolkar both prospered under the tutelage of the former deputy chief minister, and when he died, the battle for Mapusa was messy. The son won by 1,151 votes, definitely not as comfortably as his father used to since 1999. It can only get tougher in 2022. This time, Joshua is up against not just Kandolkar but Michael Lobo too. The former ports minister and Calangute MLA has quit BJP to join Congress and is now pulling out all the stops to ensure that Mapusa is weaned away from the saffron party. It won’t be easy for either of them. While BJP’s grip on Mapusa has been strong since Francis backed Manohar Parrikar to become the chief minister in 2000, Congress senses that it has a chance to win the seat for the first time since Shamsunder Neugi defeated Surendra Sirsat (MGP) in 1980. Mapusa has been with BJP since 2002 and includes 18 wards of the Mapusa Municipal Council (MMC), from a total of 20. During the recent municipal elections, panels floated by BJP and Congress won equal number of wards. Both had nine councillors, but after defections, the saffron party was able to form the council. From a total of 18 councillors, BJP has 12, while Congress is left with six. It remains to be see how many BJP councillors work wholeheartedly for Joshua’s victory. All eyes will be on BJP and Congress here, but there are others too, notably AAP Goa convener Rahul Mhambre who will hope to do better than the 2,321 votes that Shraddha Khalap polled in 2017. Tarak Arolkar (TMC) and Jitesh Kamat (Shiv Sena) are the other party candidates in the fray. Over the last two decades, some issues have continued to haunt Mapusa. It includes lack of regular water supply, traffic congestion, parking, bus stand, garbage management and bad roads. The state government has laid sewerage line in Mapusa but is yet to make the plant functional. Chief minister Pramod Sawant inaugurated a bus stand, but it remained shut for many days. Since 2002, BJP always had smooth sailing in this constituency as its candidate, the former deputy chief minister, remained very popular till his death when the party decided to nominate his son. After being denied a ticket, Kandolkar quit BJP and joined Congress to contest the 2019 byelection. He lost, but not before making his opponents sweat with even the chief minister forced to camp in Mapusa. Mapusa is a prestigious seat for BJP and it will leave no stone unturned to secure it once again. But then the party will have a familiar – and this time more powerful – opponent to contend with.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/goa/news/in-bjps-stronghold-of-mapusa-party-battles-familiar-but-stronger-opponent/articleshow/89234304.cms||Murari Shetye

And the few places that exist are closed due to the careless attitude of the civic body. More than a year has gone by since the only planetarium of the city is closed for the public because the civic body does not have a person required qualifications to run it. The officials insist that they need someone with know-how to operate the planetarium. Earlier, due to Covid-19 restrictions and now due to lesser interest of civic authorities, the planetarium is not functional. The planetarium was inaugurated again after its renovation on January 4, 2017 before assembly elections. More than Rs 55 lakh was spent on its renovation. The officials claimed that people would be able to avail useful information about astronomy through short movies. The MCL had brought advanced projector from the United States of America at the cost of Rs 50 lakh and Rs 5 lakh were spent on the general renovation and repair work. The zonal commissioner of zone, D Neeraj Jain said, “The person who was earlier handling it was retired almost a year ago and we could not hire any other person till now. But we will shortly — as soon as the code of conduct will be removed — start the process to hire someone.”Meanwhile, a resident of Hambran Road, Surinder Singh said, “The city lacks on all these fronts, despite being among top 20 smart cities. The authorities should have developed certain things for increasing knowledge of children as well as grown ups.” He claimed that keep planetarium open is not sufficient and that there should be special events when solar or lunar eclipses take place because then people want such places where they could learn the scientific theories about the same.Another resident of Civil Lines, Kapil Arora said he had visited planetarium once and it was quite good. He said more facilities like telescopes can be provided to make the experience more enriching. The planetarium has a seating capacity of 80 persons. For students, entry is free while for general public Rs 10 is charged by the civic body.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/mc-shuts-planetarium-for-a-year-due-to-lack-of-tech-staff/articleshow/89232123.cms||---

---||Ludhiana||In Ludhiana, 12.5% in 15 to 18 age group vaccinated||Ludhiana: About 12.49% of the eligible population in the 15-18 age group has turned up to get jabbed so far. It was only after schools started organising vaccination camps that the drive got a much needed push. In a bid to give it further fillip, the education department has added a link under student menu in e-Punjab portal. The schools have to update the details about vaccinated students on the portal.The vaccination drive for this group began on January 3 and only 4% of the population was vaccinated till January 18. The reason for the slow start is being attributed to hesitancy, both among the teens as well as their parents. Now, most of the schools have been organising vaccine camps. Covaxin is administered to all between 15 and 18 years old. According to the health department officials, there are about 2.15 lakh in the 15-18 age group, of which 26,863 (12.49%) have been vaccinated until Sunday.Talking to TOI, principal of Nankana Sahib Public School, Gill Road, Harmeet Kaur Waraich, who is also deputy CBSE city coordinator, said, “Our 83% of students got vaccinated in a camp organised by the school where Sangeeta Singla from ESI dispensary Gill Road along with her paramedical staff administered the vaccine to more than 250 students out of 300. Few of the students were not able to get the vaccine, as they were down with fever and doctors refused them.”“The initiative was appreciated by students and parents as it made vaccines accessible. Also, it was more convenient for them, as we had all the records and the computer staff helped the health department and enrolled students,” added Waraich.Principal of Ryan International School, Gurpal Anand said, “We had organised a two-day vaccination camp for over 1,000 students who are above 15. On the first day, only 70 students of Class XII got vaccinated. However, on the second day, 150 students from classes IX to XII were administered vaccination. Others will be covered in the next camp which we will be conducted next week.”Rajni Kalra, principal of DCM presidency School, said, “We organised a vaccination camp with the assistance of the district health department. More than 200 students from our school and other schools have got their first dose of vaccination.”BCM School Basant Avenue also organised a camp on Sunday from 10am to 2pm in collaboration with the Civil Hospital Ludhiana. Deputy commissioner Varinder Sharma, civil surgeon Dr S P Singh visited the camp to motivate the youngsters. School principal Vandna Shahi said, “Around 400 students were vaccinated (320 with Covaxin and 30 with Covishield) during the camp and certificates were also issued. It was essential for the students to come back to the campus because their future is at stake. The vaccine will build the body’s immune system and reduce the probability of contracting Covid-19.” DAV Public School in BRS Nagar will be organising a camp on February 2 at the school auditorium.Data to be uploaded on e-PunjabDistrict education officer, secondary, Lakhvir Singh Samra said, “A new link has been added and activated about update of vaccination details of eligible students under student menu in e-Punjab portal. Now, schools can update the details of their vaccinated students on the portal. The schools are closed as of now, but we are urging students to get vaccinated. Teachers are also helping by proving them with information on vaccination sites.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/in-ludhiana-12-5-in-15-to-18-age-group-vaccinated/articleshow/89232127.cms||Mehak Jain

Sukhwinder Singh, 40, a resident of Gorsian Hakamrai village, Ladhowal, has received three bullet injuries.Sukhwinder’s neighbour Harpal Singh, who took him to civil hospital, said, “Sukhwinder had double shift on Saturday night and Sunday morning.

After getting ready, he was going back to duty to Rajgarh Estate on his motorcycle around 6.30am on Sunday when two men on a red Royal Enfield bike fired at him.”Sukhwinder said the duo fired at least four shots of which three hit him. “The two soon sped away. Five to 10 minutes later, an acquaintance saw an injured Sukhwinder on the road and informed his family. His family took him to a clinic in the village. When I came to know about the incident, I went there and took Sukhwinder to civil hospital and informed the police,” Harpal added.He said he has never seen Sukhwinder and his family involved in any fight. The family is clueless why Sukhwinder was attacked.PAU police station SHO sub-inspector Rajinderpal Singh, said, “Sukhwinder has suffered two bullet injuries on his right shoulder and one on his lower back. The accused were following him from Ladhowal and opened fire on him on Malakpur Bet-Noorpur Bet Road. The initial probe suggests it to be a case of rivalry as the accused did not try to rob him. However, Sukhwinder and his family said they had no rivalry with anyone. Sukhwinder’s condition is stated to be out of danger.”The police have scanned the footage of the CCTVs installed near the spot. However, the cameras hardly captured anything due to the fog.A case has been registered against the two accused under sections 307 (attempt to murder), 34 (act done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the IPC and Arms Act.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/2-men-fire-4-shots-at-security-guard/articleshow/89232128.cms||---

Khangura has sent his resignation letter to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, copy of which he has posted on Twitter along with the comment, “The decisions we take determine our fate. My resignation from INC, the only Indian political party I have ever been a member of.”According to Khangura’s letter, his father too, who is associated with Congress for 60 years, has resigned. Sources close to Khangura said it was because he was demanding ticket from either Sahnewal or Amargarh constituencies, but Congress fielded other candidates for both seats.In another setback for Congress, several prominent faces of the party who were eyeing ticket from Ludhiana south are likely to revolt against the party. The ticket from the constituency has been given to Ishwarjot Singh Cheema, who is said to be close to cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu, on Sunday. According to sources, due to this development, two-three senior Congressmen are likely to resign from party to either contest elections as independent or join other parties. K K Bawa, chairman of Punjab State Industrial Development Board, who had applied for ticket from this constituency will be holding a press conference today. Besides Bawa, Punjab Medium Industrial Development Board Amarjit Singh Tikka and Nikki Ryait were among the prominent contenders from this seat. In other bad news for Congress from Sahnewal, where party is already facing revolt by prominent leader Satwinder Bitti, Youth Congress president Lucky Sandhu too has now has now opposed the ticket to Vikram Bajwa (son-in-law of former chief minister Rajinder Kaur Bhattal). Sandhu today revolted against the party and organised a rally of his supporters today at Sahnewal and it is likely that he will contest the elections as an independent.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/congress-ex-mla-jassi-from-qila-raipur-resigns/articleshow/89232129.cms||Mohit Behl

They say it’s high time that reliefs, like reduction of GST, easy and subsidised financing, are given to them. Be it fastener manufacturers, auto parts makers or sewing machine parts’ industry, everyone is demanding a special package for the engineering sector, especially the small units, as for almost two years they have been battling different problems. According to Gurpargat Singh Kahlon, president of Auto Parts’ Manufacturers’ Association, “It has been more than four years now since GST came into existence, but to date its rules and regulations are complex. Besides, different tax rates are also causing huge problems. The rate on several auto components and even fasteners is 28%, whereas on most other parts it is 18%. It is therefore the need of the hour to bring GST of the entire engineering sector to a uniform rate of 12%.” Inderjit Singh Navyug, former president of United Cycle and Parts’ Manufacturers’ Association, says, “The small-scale units that are into manufacturing parts of bicycles, sewing machines and autos and fasteners are facing a huge problem of funds for the past sometime. This is because all expenses, be it labour charges, raw material cost and freight, have risen sharply, but we have been unable to increase the rates of our end products. Therefore, we are in dire need of easy financing. The Union finance minister should announce some new schemes through which the micro and small units are given interest-free and easy short-term loans.”Jagbir Singh Sokhi, president of Sewing Machine Technology Park Cluster, says, “Businessmen from the engineering sector are desperately waiting for the Budget and anticipating measures to uplift the industry whose progress has been jeopardised due to the pandemic. The major steps that can result in revival are increasing the income tax exemption limit to at least Rs 7 lakh, introducing a mobile app for easy filing of GST returns and introducing freight subsidy for the factory owners of land-locked states like Punjab.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/pandemic-hit-engg-sector-wants-low-gst-easy-financing/articleshow/89232135.cms||Mohit Behl

Dr Thacker told TOI, “Going by the epidemiology, children are getting infected with Covid in the third wave though testing is on a lower scale among them, but the disease is mostly mild. Second, as was seen in other countries, we have not seen any multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) during the past one-and-a-half months of the third wave.” MIS-C is a serious condition that appears to be linked to Covid-19. According to Mayoclinic, some organs and tissues — such as heart, lungs, blood vessels, kidneys, digestive system, brain, skin or eyes — become severely inflamed of children who go on to develop MIS-C. Dr Thacker said sporadic hospitalisation in children had been reported due to Covid, but most such cases involved those with comorbidities. “In most cases, the fever seems to be abating in two to three days or even sooner than that,” he said. Dr Sanjay Natu, chairman of Indian Academy of Paediatrics, Pune chapter, told TOI, “Most children infected in the current wave present with fever, while some older children also develop headache. Fever lasts for just two to three days, after which the child starts recovering. Most infected children are recovering with basic paracetamol, required for symptomatic treatment. They must only maintain a good fluid and food intake, besides taking sufficient rest to recover.” Dr Rajesh Kulkarni, paediatrician, YCM Hospital, Pune, said, “Over the last few days, I have seen many children with Covid. The age group affected was from six months to adolescents. Many were asymptomatic contacts of adults diagnosed with Covid in the family. Among children who had symptoms, most had moderate to high fever for two days associated with headache and body ache. Some children also had vomiting and diarrhoea. But all of them recovered with symptomatic therapy. Only a couple of them required admission, but none required oxygen. We can now say with reasonable confidence that Omicron causes only a mild disease in children.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/covid-mild-in-kids-during-third-wave-top-expert/articleshow/89232138.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Ludhiana||32% of elderly yet to receive 2nd vax dose||Ludhiana: Even as most of the persons who died this month were partially or not vaccinated and in 60-plus age group, it is a challenge for the health department to get them jabbed. The department officials said most of the elderly deceased had multiple comorbidities and vaccination would have avoided severe symptoms.As per the recent health department data, of the 40 deaths in Ludhiana in the past week, 32 were above 45 years and 23 were 60-plus.Civil surgeon Dr S P Singh said, “The recent data shows that 50% to 60% of those who died were unvaccinated. Between January 1 and 28, 60% of the deceased were in 60-plus age group. We are focussing on getting this age group fully vaccinated as they are vulnerable.”This month’s vaccination data shows that till January 29 evening, 67.9% of persons in above 60-year age group were fully vaccinated. Even as their vaccination started on March 1 last year, 32% of them are yet to receive the second dose. There has been 8% increase in the elderly receiving the second jab from January 1 to 29.In the first week of November, 56% of the elderly had got fully vaccinated. Therefore, there has been an about 12% rise since then.District immunisation officer (DIO) Dr Manisha said, “A number of persons who died recently were unvaccinated or partially vaccinated and 60-plus. We are trying to persuade people, including the vulnerable group, to get fully jabbed. Vaccination will reduce severity of the disease.”“Those who have got both the doses must go for booster shot as the immunity starts waning after months,” said Ludhiana IMA president Dr Bimal Kanish.An elderly man from Pakhowal Road, who has not got the second dose, said, “As the recent wave is receding and there is less likelihood of another wave, I didn’t go for the second dose.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/32-of-elderly-yet-to-receive-2nd-vax-dose/articleshow/89232139.cms||Shariq Majeed

The accident caused a major traffic jam on the Pune-to-Mumbai corridor of the highway. It took almost an hour for the traffic authorities to restore normal vehicular movement. Four of the victims _ Mahavir Tilok (43), Shalini Tilok (20), Seema Raj (36), Masidevi Tilok (65) were fromthe same family from Shanti Park society on Mira Road. The fifth victim, Rihan Ansari (30) of Kurla in Mumbai, was driving the car. “The family was taking Masidevi to a hospital in Nipani along Kolhapur’s border with Karnataka for treatment of an ailment,” inspector Pravin More of the Lonavla rural police said. Assistant inspector Sumaiya Bagwan of Highway Safety Patrol (HSP) told TOI, “The cause of the accident is being ascertained. Prima facie, the car was proceeding at break-neck speed towards Pune. After crossing Karla Phata, its driver seemed to have lost control over the wheel. The car first hit a median before jumping over it and crashing into the container truck which was moving towards Mumbai.” Due to the impact, one of the women sitting next to the driver, was thrown out of the SUV and came under the rear wheels of the container truck. Four others in the SUV died on the spot. Container truck driver Gahininath Shekde (35) of Beed district, escaped with minor injuries. When contacted, Shekde told TOI, “I was driving an empty container to Mumbai. The SUV which was at high speed all of sudden jumped the median in front of me and before I could react, it crashed into my vehicle. The impact was on the lower side of the container. Hence, I sustained minor injuries. Had the SUV hit my truck a little higher, my injuries would have been severe. The road towards Pune was clear and no one had come in front of the SUV.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/5-die-after-suv-hits-median-crashes-into-truck-in-lonavla/articleshow/89232141.cms||Mihir Tanksale

The complainant then questioned their authority to conduct the survey and asked them why they were doing the PMC’s job. This led to a verbal exchange and the subsequent assault,” senior inspector Deepak Lagad said.The victim lodged a complaint with the police later in the evening. TOI made repeated calls to the victim on his cellphone on Sunday evening, but he did not respond till the time of going to press.“The former corporator and his accomplices were moving around in the Mohammedwadi area, asking people if they had received the jabs. They were also urging people to take the jabs if they had not taken it yet. At this moment, the elderly man was walking back to his residence. He asked the former corporator why were they involved in the vaccination drive? He told them that it was the PMC and government’s work and they should not meddle in the vaccine drive,” Lagad said.This led to an arguments between the elderly man and the former corporator and his accomplices. “The former corporator, his sons, and accomplices assaulted the victim with rubber pipes and plastic jars. The elderly man suffered injuries on his hands and back,” he added. We have booked the eight men and are probing the case, Lagad said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/ex-corporator-7-aides-booked-for-assaulting-elderly-man/articleshow/89232143.cms||---

The police seized his cellphone and took out mirror images of the same so that forensic experts could carry out a data dig out. “The objective is to establish the persons with whom he was in contact with. The data related to the TET, which he may have deleted, and other such information,” an officer associated with the probe told TOI. Police said Khodwekar, arrested from Thane on Saturday morning, did not divulge much information during the recording of his statement in custody.A senior police officer told TOI, “Khodwekar has mostly responded with silence to the questions posed by us during his custodial interrogation. Now, we are focusing on gathering the digital and documentary data against him.”“During his tenure with the state education department, Khodwekar was in touch with Maharashtra State Council of Examinations (MSCE)’s commissioner Tukaram Supe, GA Software’s director Pritish Deshmukh, and more importantly with consultant to the education department Abhishekh Savarikar,” the officer said.In December last year, the cyber police arrested Supe, former MSCE commissioner Sukhdeo Dere (61), Deshmukh, former manager of GA Software Ashwin Kumar (49) from Bengaluru, Savarikar and others in the case.“While interrogating Supe, it was revealed that Savarikar had prepared a list of over 300 candidates and passed it on to Khodwekar,” the officer said.“Khodwekar gave it to Supe and Supe made the necessary changes in the marks and answer sheets of the candidates in the list,” added the officer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/cellphone-of-arrested-ias-officer-in-tet-case-seized/articleshow/89232144.cms||---

---||Pune||Consider all flu cases Covid, Omicron leading strain: NIV||PUNE: It’s winter, but scientists at the National Institute of Virology said they haven’t found a single case of seasonal influenza or other respiratory viruses during routine screening in the past three weeks. The experts said this apparent absence of seasonal viruses means one thing: the Omicron variant has made SARS-CoV-2 the dominant virus in the region, and Covid should be suspected in anyone showing up with acute respiratory distress. “Positivity rate for influenza and other respiratory viruses has reduced to zero this month,” an ICMR official told TOI on Sunday. “We have not detected a single case in the last three weeks. That simply means Omicron is currently the predominant strain and every case of acute respiratory illness should be suspected and treated for Covid unless proven otherwise.” For SARS-CoV-2, the positivity rate among ICMR-NIV’s samples had jumped to 50% in mid-January, from the 15% to 20% in December and early January. As for influenza and other respiratory viruses, positivity rate was 10% to 20% among the swab samples tested until recently, especially in August, September and October. And a handful of influenza positive samples were also detected in December. The ICMR official said, “The ICMR-NIV tests 350 to 450 swab samples every day for SARS-CoV-2, influenza and other respiratory viruses. These samples are mainly drawn from community and hospitalized cases in Pune and adjoining areas. Of them, nearly 50% samples have been testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 from mid-January, which shows predominance of the pandemic Omicron strain currently.” In a week, ICMR-NIV screens nearly 40 hospital samples for respiratory viruses. “Every swab sample is tested for SARS-CoV-2 as well as endemic influenza viruses. Other respiratory viruses including RSV and parainfluenza, are also being tracked. We have not seen a single case of respiratory viruses in the samples screened in January so far,” the official said. Physician Dr Narendra Javadekar said, “The ICMR-NIV observations indicate SARS-CoV-2 has replaced seasonal influenza viruses common in the winter. That means we should treat a person with flu or common cold as a Covid case.” Dr Javadekar also drew attention to Covid testing. “Sensitivity of RT-PCR test is 70%, which means we may be missing 30% of the cases. Again, how a swab sample is drawn is a key determinant. Many flu patients are currently not undergoing Covid tests. But the elderly and those with comorbid conditions should remain vigilant.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/consider-all-flu-cases-covid-omicron-leading-strain-niv/articleshow/89232146.cms||Umesh Isalkar

However, the chill factor in the air remained the same and may continue for the next few days, said IMD officials. The continuing incursion of cold northerly winds, besides, the reduced gap in the day and the night temperatures and the presence of a western disturbance has contributed to the prevailing cold conditions, IMD officials added. The Lohegaon observatory, which covers the eastern fringes of the city, recorded a night temperature of 11.7 degrees C on Sunday, which was lesser than the 12.1 degrees C recorded on Saturday. Northerly winds have been penetrating the state for the last few days and this condition is likely to continue in the coming days too, met officials said. “There is an anticyclonic circulation at the lower atmospheric level. Thus, the northerly wind pattern is taking turns towards the east. Because of these conditions, minimum temperatures are expected to increase gradually in the days to come. The weather condition is likely to remain dry till the end of January. The city’s night temperature may hover between 10-12 degrees celsius,” said a met official. “The night temperatures may remain below normal range by one or two degrees celsius, but the days are expected to remain cooler. The day temperature maybe around 28-29 degrees celsius in the next few days,” the official added. At the same time, the day temperatures of Pune city and other weather stations in the Madhya Maharashtra, recorded over 30 degrees celsius. Shivajinagar and Lohegaon observatories recorded 31.7 and 31.4 degrees celsius.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/night-chilly-at-8-9c-but-day-temp-goes-up-by-over-20-deg/articleshow/89232147.cms||---
---||Pune||Covid-19: Posers on delay in rollout of DCGI-approved jabs||PUNE: The three vaccines against Covid-19 — Covovax, Corbevax and ZyCov-D — receiving the Drug Controller General of India’s nod last year for emergency use in the country are yet to be used in the immunisation drive in India, casting posers on the delay in their utilisation. Experts claimed that this was the right time to expedite the rollout of the approved vaccines because the government had started the vaccination of adolescents and precautionary doses were being administered to the vulnerable population and frontline workers. A leading public health expert said these three vaccines’ manufacturers would have to ensure enough supplies before the rollout was announced, though. Currently, only Covaxin is being administered to children, while all the three vaccines rolled out last year —Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik V — are being used as precaution doses. Covovax, manufactured by Serum Institute of India (SII), and Corbevax of Biological E received the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI)’s nod for restricted use in an emergency setting in December last year. The Zydus Cadila-manufactured “ZyCov-D” was given emergency usage approval by the DCGI in August 2021.  Experts felt that the rollout of these three would have strengthened the vaccine basket of India against Covid-19. Officials from the Union health ministry admitted that the firms’ production capacity was an issue in introducing these three vaccines in the current programme. He said with most of the population been vaccinated with Covishield and Covaxin, the focus of the new vaccines would be in poorly-vaccinated areas, especially in the Northeast states. A senior official from the Union health ministry, under the condition of anonymity, said they had placed orders for new vaccines for the states and areas with poor vaccination. “We should start getting the supply of at least ZyCovD in approximately a month’s time. After the emergency authorisation is issued to a vaccine, the central government can place orders, and it has been done. The other two should also be included shortly,” said the official. When ZyCov-D was cleared, many states were allocated doses. But some are yet to receive them. Maharashtra had placed an order for nearly 14 lakh doses for areas with poor first dose vaccination, mainly in Nashik and Jalgaon districts. “We had got the sanction in November, but we are yet to receive the vaccines,” said a senior public health official of the state.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/posers-on-delay-in-rollout-of-dcgi-approved-jabs/articleshow/89232148.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The director of primary’s education, Dinkar Temkar, issued instructions to schools following a prolonged process this year which was carried till December. Temkar said that the students were facing academic loss due to late admissions. According to instructions released by the education directorate, the lottery will be drawn only once in the starting of the admission rounds and schools will be given a list of applications which would be on waiting in case the lottery admissions are not fulfilled. “We have instructed schools that even if there are vacant seats after September 30, the admissions should not be continued and stopped at where it was,” said Temkar. For two years, the admission process has been going on till December-January causing major academic loss to students who receive admission in the last round. According to instructions released by the education directorate, the lottery will be drawn only once in the starting of the admission rounds and schools will be given a list of applications which would be on waiting in case the lottery admissions are not fulfilled. The applicants will be given a fixed period of time to confirm their admissions and if they fail to confirm within the given deadline, then applications from the waiting list will sent a text message on registered mobile number.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/sept-30-deadline-for-schools-to-complete-rte-admissions/articleshow/89232150.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Pune||Stylish Musetti keen to get back to winning ways||Pune: Lorenzo Musetti belongs to that special group of tennis players whom the fans would pay to watch.The 19-year-old Italian combines the power of modern game with elegance and a large part of that has to do with his one-handed backhand.He still has a long way to go in terms of being a contender in majors but clearly a future Grand Slam champion in the making.The single-handed backhand is one of the sport’s enduring beauty, and that clay court-bred Europeans should excel in it makes it all the more delightful.One expert explanation for this sweet anomaly is that the players are being coached by those who had excelled with one-handed backhand in the not so distant past.Musetti, the 2019 Australian Open boys’ champion, offered a different, more practical view on the subject.“For me, it was natural. When I started to play it was with one-handed backhand. I continued like that,” said Musetti, the second at the $494,000 Tata Open Maharashtra. “I think it was the right choice to make. When I first got my racquet, the first time I played, it was natural (for me) to play with one hand.“Some things are never gonna change. There are a lot of players that play naturally with two-handed backhand and they are never gonna change. “What you are comfortable (with), you go with it.”Musetti was one of 10 Italians — second only to the USA (15) and Spain (12) — in the men’s draw at this year’s first Grand Slam in Melbourne.The teenager himself bowed out in the first round, as well as in the lead-up event in Adelaide. His epic five-set loss to Novak Djokovic in the fourth round of the French Open now seems like long ago but he still derives inspiration from that match.“That was one of the best matches I have played and for sure it helped me to understand a lot of things, that I can be at that level and reach that level with my game,” Musetti said.“When you compare (yourself) with World No. 1 there is nothing (like it). For a young player it is really helpful. I hope to reach that level again, to play a lot of matches like that.“I played two good matches with very good opponents (this year). They showed that they were playing their best tennis. “Both of the matches were close and I am here (in Pune) to play matches, trying to go as far as I can and get the confidence back, and the game that I used to have earlier.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/stylish-musetti-keen-to-get-back-to-winning-ways/articleshow/89232151.cms||---

The civic administration will publish the proposed new wards on February 1. The directives were given by state election commission to the civic body on Saturday. “Citizens will be able to give their suggestions and objections on the delimitation till February 14. The hearing is expected to be completed by February 26 and the draft with remarks on the hearing has to be submitted to the state election commission by March 2,” directives from Kiran Kurundkar, secretary of state election commission, said. As per the directives the delimitation has been finalized for 173 corporators up from the existing strength of 164. A three-ward panel system has been declared for the elections scheduled in February. The existing system is of four-ward panel. The civic body will have 58 electoral panels. Three corporators each would be elected from 57 electoral panels and two corporators from one electoral panel. After a delay, the draft delimitation plan was submitted to the state election commission on January 20. The deadline was January 6 but was extended to January 15. But submission could not be done in the stipulated period. The restrictions due to Covid 19 spread and emergence of Omicron led to obstacles in submission.

Not more than 10% of all kinds of vehicles transporting students to and from schools in Pune district will start operations, transporters have said, adding that the “sudden” decision to reopen schools has caught them off guard. “We were earlier informed that the schools would be reopening from February 15. Suddenly on Friday, a decision was made to reopen the schools from next Tuesday. How are transporters going to be ready? This has not happened for the first time and the sudden decisions are giving us no time to prepare,” Kiran Desai, the working president of the Pune Bus Owners Association and a task force member of school bus transport appointed by the state government, told TOI. At present, there are around 10,000 vehicles of different kinds carrying students to schools in Pune district. The number has come down by almost 5,000 from the time the pandemic hit. “I have not been approached by any school to start transportation. This is happening for the third or fourth time that schools are reopening and shutting down due to surge in Covid-19 cases. At present, Covid cases in Pune are on the higher side. Some schools contacted me informing they might start in March and they wanted to keep an eye on the situation now and continue with the online classes,” Raju Latamble, a transporter who has more than 200 school buses, told TOI. He said, “Even if we are approached by a school to start the services, we would need at least three weeks because we need time to get the buses ready and bring back the staff.” They added that bringing back the staff, especially the women bus attendants, was another challenge. “They want guarantee of prolonged employment without being fired and a salary hike of at least 30%. Most of them who have left are into other forms of employment. Similar is the situation with our drivers and conductors.,” Desai said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/just-10-of-10k-school-buses-may-ply-from-feb-1/articleshow/89232153.cms||Joy Sengupta

---||Pune||Bridge courses, mental well-being part of state roadmap for learning||PUNE: The focus in the next academic year would not be limited to just improving the fundamental learning objectives of the students, but also helping them with their mental well-being. While another learning loss survey would be conducted to gauge where the students stand so that a roadmap can be prepared for what more needs to be done to bridge courses as well as for planning extra classes, there would also be programmes to mentor children and help them tide over the two years of gap in offline education they encountered, officials from the education department said. Apart from this, the state has also planned to reduce drop-out rate and encourage girls’ education by adding standards VIII to XII in neighbourhood schools where classes are only up to Std VII. The change would be reflected in the textbooks itself as bilingual textbooks are being introduced to improve student engagement and language skills. “From next year, we will introduce a single textbook formula to reduce the weight of school bags carried by students every day. This will be introduced in Std I from the academic year 2022-23 and will be implemented for all primary classes later. Once the new State Curriculum Framework is designed, work will also be cut out for us to revive the textbooks as per the new Education Policy,” Krishnakumar Patil, director of Maharashtra State Bureau of Textbook Production & Curriculum Research (Balbharati), said. Unlike this year, when students received the textbooks months after the academic year began, they will be delivered on time, Patil added. Vikas Garad, deputy director of State Council of Educational Research and Training, said that the next academic year will focus on introducing more co-curricular activities for better interaction between pupil and teachers as well as among pupils. The focus will also be on a robust assessment process, and more emphasis on the mental well-being of the child. “As you know due to online education, there is limited teacher-pupil interaction and there is almost no peer learning. We are seeing a trend where students are lagging not just in classwise learning objectives, but also behaviourally, there are some drawbacks. Our priority is that in the coming years, we would try to bring things back to normal and in this project, we would also seek help from child psychologists, counsellors, NGOs and interested parties. A school is like a small ecosystem where the student gets to learn life skills too. While academics is a major part of it, so are things like working in a team, accepting failure, helping each other, working with people from different backgrounds and thinking processes which we learn along the way in schools. We also need to inculcate reading habits in them and de-addicted from online devices. We need to make them listen, ask questions, seek answers and so on. So various co-curricular activities are also planned,” Garad said. Garad said that a learning loss survey would be done to understand the lacunae and accordingly bridge courses would be suggested. With the possibility of another session on online learning, Garad said that classwise, chapter wise videos are also on the cards which will be uploaded on the YouTube channel of SCERT so that every student can access it whenever they want for free. There will also be a survey on out-of-school children so that proper measures can be taken to bring them back, said Vishal Solanki, commissioner of education. “Only when the physical schools start regularly will we be able to authentically conduct a survey on out-of-school children. Secondly, we already had discussions with many NGOs and others regarding sex education in schools pre-pandemic.

Test positivity rate in Dakshina Kannada, which stood at 10.9% a week ago, has dropped below 8%, while CFR in the coastal district is disturbingly higher than that of Karnataka. On Saturday, the overall CFR of Karnataka was 0.2%, while the corresponding figure for Dakshina Kannada was 0.7%. Of the 50 Covid fatalities reported in Dakshina Kannada till January 30, 31 were reported in the past week. Dakshina Kannada district health officer Dr Kishore Kumar M told TOI that most of the people who had succumbed to Covid-19 in Dakshina Kannada district in the past month were elderly citizens, and those with co-morbid disorders. “Nearly 95% of the Covid patients who died had severe co-morbid conditions, including chronic kidney and liver ailments, heart diseases, and, in some cases, genetic disorders as well. Problems in the liver contributed to the death of many patients. All Covid patients who have died during the third wave breathed their last in the hospitals. No Covid patient isolated at home has been reported dead. The case fatality rate is, however, markedly lower than it was during the first and second waves of Covid,” said Dr Kishore Kumar said. The DHO admitted that the Covid curve spiked in Dakshina Kannada during the second and third weeks of January, and the number of patients who had to be hospitalised too rose, albeit slightly, in that period. “In the past week, those who have died were those in whom the infection was severe, in addition to suffering from other illnesses for a prolonged period. More than 60% of those who died, succumbed within 72 hours of being admitted to the hospital, while some passed away 10 days later,” said Dr Kishore Kumar. As on Saturday, the active caseload in Dakshina Kannada stood at 4,792, of whom 436 were being treated across various hospitals. Only 90 Covid patients require oxygen, while four are on high-flow oxygen, 54 are in the intensive care unit and 24 are on ventilator, the DHO added.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Driving skill tests on all 7 days to clear backlog created by curbs||NEW DELHI: Starting Monday, driving skill tests for a permanent driving licence will be carried out on all seven days of the week. The decision has been taken by the Delhi government’s transport department to clear the backlog caused by suspension of tests earlier this month. From January 6, all driving skill tests and learner’s licence tests were suspended by the department in view of the rising number of Covid-19 cases, even though online ‘faceless services’ continued to function. This Friday, the suspension was revoked, with restrictions being lifted on other activities in the city with the dip in Covid-19 cases and positivity rate. “Applicants can now take a driving skill test appointment for Monday also, which is the day when tests are not carried out otherwise,” an official said. “Driving skill tests were suspended for some time and those who had appointments couldn’t appear for tests and no fresh appointments were being allowed either. As a result, there has been a backlog, which we hope would clear up in some time with the additional Monday slots now being open,” he said. The official said that many people prefer taking the tests during the weekend, on their day off from work, and that is why the department kept driving test tracks operational during the weekend, while transport officials took their leave on Monday. “We will make some rearrangements so that tests can be carried out all days in the week. This will continue for the time being and we are hopeful of clearing the backlog in the next few weeks,” he said. While all activities relating to the driving skill test and learner’s licence test, including fresh online appointments, were suspended, the existing appointments were rescheduled, and SMSs were sent to the applicants. The Delhi government revoked the order suspending the driving skill tests on Friday with the number of Covid-19 cases dipping. Meanwhile, to make fitness tests of smaller commercial vehicles at its Burari facility easier and more efficient, the department has floated tenders for setting up 10 automated inspection and certification lanes. Fitness tests of 300 small vehicles like autorickshaws and taxis are carried out manually at the facility every day on average.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/driving-skill-tests-on-all-7-days-to-clear-backlog-created-by-curbs/articleshow/89230086.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Pune||Plenty to prove for Indian quartet||Pune: When the season’s first men’s tennis event on Indian soil gets underway on Monday, the spotlight will be firmly turned on the four home players in the fray.The Tata Open Maharashtra, the fourth edition in its current avatar and the 26th instalment overall, has always been about the marquee player it has been able to attract.But it has also brought into limelight the Indian wildcards and the occasional direct acceptances. Whether it be the star combination of Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi, or Somdev Devvarman’s run to the final, the tournament has thrived on and supported home grown talent with equal measure.And with the field lacking a top-10 player in its last two editions ever since the calendar was rejigged to accommodate the ATP Cup, it has become a huge opportunity as well as a responsibility for the Indian players.Yuki Bhambri, Ramkumar Ramanathan, Prajnesh Gunneswaran and Arjun Kadhe will step on the court with different aspirations but they all have something to prove — justify their spot in the 28-player draw.Bhambri, playing with a protected ranking, hopes to revive his career for umpteenth time after yet another recovery from a knee injury.But at 29, the Delhi lad knows that time could be running out for him, at least in singles, and he needs to make the most out of this week.Currently ranked in the 1000s, Bhambri, ranked as high as 83 in 2018, is easily the most gifted tennis player India has produced in recent years. But whether he can still reproduce the form that saw him beat the likes of Gael Monfils only he, and his knee, can tell.Of the four, Ramkumar Ramanathan is the one that has the momentum going with him. The Chennai lad seems to have turned it around in 2021 with his maiden Challenger title and had a spectacular start to 2022 with the doubles title in Adelaide. For Prajnesh Gunneswaran, it is more about rediscovering the self-belief that propelled him to No. 75 three years back. Kadhe, the local lad, probably carries the heaviest cross. An ATP main draw appearance couldn’t have come at a more opportune moment for the Pune player, but having focussed on doubles , it remains to be seen how much he can take advantage. Manish, Sasi crash outThe two Indians in the qualifying draw, Sasikumar Mukund and Manish Sureshkumar, lost 3-6, 3-6 to Altug Celikbilek of Turkey and 2-6, 3-6 to Vit Kopriva of the Czech Republic respectively.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/plenty-to-prove-for-indian-quartet/articleshow/89232161.cms||---

With delays in completion of the Pune Metro work, residents said that it must be fast-tracked to avoid inconvenience. Pune Metro officials said that the pillar was being erected and it would be over by February after which the underpass would be reopened for vehicular traffic. About seven months ago, the underpass was shut down because of the two metro pillars that were coming up at the tunnel area. Commuters coming from the airport or Vimannagar or even to Ahmednagar-Pune highway had to take a detour from Vadgaonsheri signal and enter Kalyaninagar from Shastrinagar junction. Those coming from Koregaon Park or Kalyaninagar towards Vimannagar had to take the Harinagar route and cross the entire Vadgaonsheri to go towards Vimannagar. Simi Agarwal, a resident, said when the work started they gave a deadline of six months. “Now, it is about eight months and the work is still not completed. Taking the detour is not just long but also takes a lot of time because of the traffic,” she added. Another resident from Vimannagar, Tushar Marathe, said, “My office is in Koregaon Park and the route that was just about 15 minutes from my place now takes 40 minutes in peak hours. The work should be completed soon.” Sohal Shaikh, a resident of Vadgaonsheri, said, “The problem with the officials is that they do not give a proper timeline of work. They say six months and it is not yet completed. The underpass always has some issues and once in two to three years it is always shut for some reason or the other.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/ramwadi-underpass-waits-for-metro-work-to-finish/articleshow/89232163.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

The actor-MP visited the memorial of Mahatma Gandhi in Alandi, a pilgrim place, on Saturday to pay homage to him on the eve of his death anniversary. He, along with a group of his supporters and youths, sat at the memorial for a few minutes. Talking to media on the sidelines, Kolhe said, “I humbly want to say sorry to those whose sentiments have been hurt. But I just want to tell you that I have never supported the ideology of Godse and would not support it in the future too. In fact, they should understand one thing that the film was shot in 2017.” Kolhe claimed that if his role as Godse portrays one side then he would do the needful to present the other side. “I will soon do what is necessary to prevent sending a wrong message to the people,” he added. The thoughts of the father of the nation, Kolhe said, will always be there with us. “I have just played the character of Godse in the film. It does not mean that I endorse and support his ideology. Gandhiji’s thoughts will always be with us. It will never be erased because of such a small thing,” he added. “I visited the place (Alandi) because Gandhiji’s ashes were immersed in the holy river of Indrayani. I am happy that today’s youth has faith and devotion in his ideology. His message of non-violence, truth and forgiveness to the world is invaluable,” the MP from Shirur said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/ncp-mp-kolhe-apologises-for-hurting-sentiments/articleshow/89232166.cms||---

---||Pune||Charges at new parking lot in airport may remain unchanged||Pune: Parking charges at the under construction multi-level parking lot of Pune airport is expected to remain unchanged, sources said. “The construction work of the parking lot is 90% complete. The drainage work has been done and the power sub-station and the air-conditioning system are working fine. As far as the parking charges are concerned, they are expected to remain the same. The Airports Authority of India has uniform parking charges for all its airports and hence the charges will remain the same in all likelihood,” a source at the airport said. According to the charges published on the AAI website for the Pune airport, the fee for parking a car for half an hour is Rs30. Between half an hour and two hours, the fee will be Rs85. After two hours, the charges will increase by Rs20 per hour. For two-wheelers, the parking fee for half an hour will be Rs10 and Rs20 after half an hour for a maximum of two hours. Thereafter, there will be an increase of Rs20 for each hour. For SUVs, the charge until half an hour is Rs30 and after half an hour until two hours, the charge is Rs100. Thereafter, there is an increase of Rs20 for each hour. Beyond 7 hours and up to 24 hours, the parking charges for the above vehicles will be 300% of the fees taken after half an hour until two hours. The new parking lot, costing around Rs120 crore, consists of a ground and three floors and can accommodate 1,000 cars. “We are looking at the completion of the project by April end. The project, however, also involves construction of a skywalk connecting the second floor of the parking lot to the existing terminal building. The land was given to us recently and hence the skywalk will take at least three to four months to get completed. The project will surely solve the parking woes, which will be a major relief for the flyers,” another source said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/charges-at-new-parking-lot-in-airport-may-remain-unchanged/articleshow/89232171.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Pune||Only one third villages in Pune start waste management plants||PUNE: Issues related to the availability of land and internal disputes within gram panchayats have affected the Pune Zilla Parishad’s (ZP) plan to have a solid waste management plant in each of the 1,100-odd gram panchayats in the district. The ZP had planned to complete the project by October 2, 2021, as part of the `Swachh Bharat Mission. However, it has so far been able to start work on only 355 of these plants. Solid waste disposal has been a problem in villages with more than 5,000 population which prompted the ZP to go for the ambitious project. “As per the policy, the gram panchayat and block development officer of the respective tehsil need to get technical sanction at the tehsil level and complete the project. Only those projects which cost more than Rs 5 crore will be passed by the ZP. As such, five projects we have already sanctioned,” deputy chief executive officer Milind Tonpe (water and sanitisation department ) of the ZP said. About Rs156 crore is already with these gram panchayats. There is no dearth of funds. But still, the works were not completed within the deadline, Tonpe added. “Some of the gram panchayats have finished a compost plant and plastic disposal unit on their lands. Those gram panchayats that do not have their land get vacant land under the management of the district administration to set up the plant,” another senior official from the ZP said. A section of officials from the department pointed out that internal disputes over awarding the contract of the plant to a private agency has become a problem. “Thus, many gram panchayats could not finalise their plants design and proposals at their levels. Also, in some tehsils, block development officers are not working in coordination with the villages. As a result, the projects have been stuck,” the officials added. Over Rs 40,700 crore have been allocated to help over two lakh villages achieve solid and liquid waste management (SLWM) under the Swacch Bharat Mission (Grameen), the jal shakti ministry had said last year. While the Centre will spend around Rs 14,000 crore, states will spend over Rs 8,300 crore and the remaining funds will come from others sources, it said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/only-1/3rd-villages-in-pune-start-waste-mgmt-plants/articleshow/89232172.cms||---

Further, references to RSS or Hindu leaders could lead to law & order issues, they said. The event was organised by CPM, TPDK and VCK.According to police, the organisers had installed a flex banner with a photo of Mahatma Gandhi without getting permission.“While taking the oath, the organisers used some words against a particular religion which would lead to law & order issues,” a police officer said.Meanwhile, CPM state secretary K Balakrishnan issued a statement on Sunday condemning the Coimbatore city police for arguing with the organisers.Meanwhile, urban local body election flying squad officer Sureshkumar lodged a complaint against the event organiser with the Rathinapuri police who registered a case against Padmanaban from CPM, Ku Ramakrishnan from TPDK, Susi Kalaiyarasan from VCK and 20 others under sections 143, 341, 269 of the Indian Penal Code and section 4 of Tamil Nadu Open Places (Prevention of Disfigurement) Act.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/tiff-between-police-politicos-at-mahatma-death-anniv-event/articleshow/89232174.cms||---

They would remain in kraals for a month and the new mahouts and assistant mahouts (kavadis) would train them to follow their instructions.According to an official source, Suyambu was kept at Chadivayal elephant camp for more than two years to tackle man-animal conflict in the Coimbatore forest division. It was sent back to Kozhikamuthi elephant camp in 2020 after it started indulging in ferocious activities and disobeying the mahouts. A forest officer, who didn’t want to be identified, said, “The kumki was not responding to the commands of its mahout and kavadi for the past few weeks. So, we decided to keep the animal inside the kraal for a month.”The tusker (Ashok), he said, was brought to Kozhikamuthi elephant camp from Arignar Anna Zoological Park at Vandalur four years ago. “It killed its kavadi V Arumugam near the camp on January 16 while he was trying to take the elephant for grazing. After that, the tusker was reluctant to follow the commands of mahout.”The officer said Anaimalai Tiger Reserve field director S Ramasubramanian, deputy field director M G Ganesan, forest veterinary officer A Sukumar and elephant experts had given their consent to keep the two elephants inside the kraal for a month a few days ago. Subsequently, both the kumki and the tusker were shifted to Varakaliyar elephant camp from Kozhikamuthi in trucks on Sunday and kept in kraals.“Suyambu was well trained to become a kumki. We have appointed new mahout Suresh and kavadi Prasad to handle the elephant, while mahout Manikandan and kavadi Kannan would take care of the tusker (Ashok). The tusker was never kept in a kraal before, as it was rescued by the forest department as a calf. Ashok is expected to obey the commands of mahout and kavadi soon,” the officer said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/wayward-elephants-detained-in-kraals-at-varakaliyar-camp/articleshow/89232177.cms||A Subburaj

The day of Gandhi’s assassination is observed as ‘Shaurya Diwas’ by the mahasabha. Announcing the awards, Ashok Sharma, vice-president of the ultra right-wing outfit, said, “This is the first time we have conferred this award on those who believe in Godse’s ideology and promote it. The award includes a medal and a commendation letter.” The recipients include religious leader Kalicharan Maharaj who was arrested on January 12 in Maharashtra for derogatory remarks against Gandhi. He had been granted bail by a Thane court on Friday.

This year the expectation is that the Budget would provide at least 10% of the GDP on the education sector.Experts felt there is a need to focus on education, skill development, better infrastructure and enhanced employment opportunities in this year’s budget. “Despite tall claims, budgetary allocation for the education sector has never crossed 6% of the GDP. I hope that trend doesn’t continue this year too. At least 7-8% of the GDP should be allotted to the education sector. The government should extend and provide initiatives to support the ed-tech environment so that infrastructure can be further strengthened in the country,” said Swoyan Satyendu, chief operating officer, ODM Educational Group.“This year started with a fresh wave of the pandemic that further shaken the backbone of our education system. The learning loss needs immediate addressal in the Union Budget,” said Monalisa Bal, chairperson of KIIT International School. She said development of digital infrastructure did not receive due consideration in last year’s budget and hence, it is imperative to allocate sufficient funds for the development of a robust digital infrastructure. “We must ensure that no student is left behind owing to financial and technological disadvantage,” she added.“We expect to see an increase in the allocation for education from 6%, as was done in 2021,” said Silpi Sahoo, chairperson of SAI International School.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/call-for-more-budget-outlay-on-education/articleshow/89232185.cms||Minati Singha

---||Bhubaneswar||Genome study on 300 samples||Bhubaneswar: The Institute of Life Sciences (ILS) on Sunday started genome sequencing of 300 samples collected from 14 districts to ascertain if there are Covid-19 variants other than Omicron and Delta circulating in the community. The ILS genomic study by random and cluster sampling will help to ascertain the extent of spread of Omicron in various districts and new variant (if any). “The genomic study for surveillance will continue even if Omicron replaces Delta completely in the state, which is likely to happen in the next two weeks. Now, Omicron accounts for 70-75% of the Covid cases. The focus is now to establish correlation between different variants and hospitalisation parameters like oxygen demand, ICU requirement and other complications,” said Ajay Parida, director, ILS. The last time the ILS came out with its genome sequencing report in the third wave was on January 19, when Omicron had already emerged as the dominant variant in the community with 58% samples testing positive for it. The samples from 10 districts had been analysed at that time.Recently, the Omisure kit has been distributed to all the districts apart from the five cities. The RT-PCR-based kit helps to differentiate the Omicron variant from other strains of Covid. “We are yet to compile a report on how many samples have been used so far. But Omicron appears to be the dominant variant in Omisure-based surveillance as well,” said Niranjan Mishra, director, public health. The state added another 4,843 infections on Sunday registering the same test positivity rate (7.58%) as that on Saturday. As many as 9,191 patients recovered on Sunday. The recovery figure exceeded the new infections by more than 4,000.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/genome-study-on-300-samples/articleshow/89232189.cms||---
