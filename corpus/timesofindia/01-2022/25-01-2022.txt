This observation was made by a bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and Dinesh Maheshwari while granting bail to Md Enamul Haque, the alleged prime accused in the trans-border cattle smuggling case in which the central agency had also arrested a BSF commandant for his alleged involvement in the smuggling activities, proceeds of which were allegedly paid to political parties and local administration officials. Appearing for Haque, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi said that the CBI has filed a chargesheet in the alleged cattle-smuggling case on February 6, 2021 and followed it up with a supplementary chargesheet on February 21 last year. He said the accused BSF commandant as well as other accused have also been granted bail but the Calcutta High Court had rejected Haque's bail plea even though he has been in jail for more than one year in an offence which prescribes a maximum punishment of seven years imprisonment. For the CBI, additional solicitor general Aman Lekhi said the petitioner is the kingpin of a racket involving BSF personnel, customs officials, local police and others for trans-border cattle smuggling through the porous Indo-Bangladesh border. He also said that Haque evaded a look out notice but he surfaced in West Bengal by reaching West Bengal through land route from Bangladesh, thus, indicating collusion by local police and raising a grave concern for national security. When he said investigation into a larger conspiracy is still pending, Justices Chandrachud and Maheshwari asked, "This open ended investigation is what we do not comprehend. How detaining a person indefinitely will help in probing larger conspiracy when other accused have been granted bail? Is one year and two months, for which he has been in custody, not enough for probing the larger conspiracy?" The bench granted Haque bail saying his continued detention was not warranted.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cant-keep-someone-in-jail-indefinitely-over-national-security-fears-supreme-court/articleshow/89101358.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||World||3 ex-police officers were indifferent to Floyd's pleas: Jury told in opening remarks in fed trial||ST PAUL: Three former Minneapolis officers broke the law by failing to stop Derek Chauvin killing George Floyd during an arrest and were indifferent to the handcuffed Black man's dying pleas, a prosecutor told a jury in opening statements in the federal trial on Monday. Tou Thao, J. Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane are charged with violating Floyd's civil rights during the arrest of the 46-year-old on a road outside a Minneapolis grocery store in May 2020, video of which sparked street protests against racism and police brutality around the world.  Federal prosecutor Samantha Trepel, from the U.S. Department of Justice's civil rights division, said the defendants had broken their oath with a callous indifference to Floyd. She said video captured how Kueng at times seemed more preoccupied with some gravel lodged in the tire of the nearby police car than the man beneath him repeatedly saying: "I can't breathe."  Last year, the defendants' former colleague Derek Chauvin , 45, was found guilty of murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death at the end of a nationally televised state trial in April 2021, and a Minnesota judge sentenced him to 22-1/2 years in prison.  Chauvin, who is white, was also charged alongside his colleagues by federal prosecutors with violating Floyd's civil rights in their capacity as police officers. Chauvin changed his plea to guilty last December. Thao, Kueng and Lane who could face years in prison if convicted, have all pleaded not guilty.  "For more than nine minutes, each of the three defendants made a conscious choice over and over again not to act," Trepel told the jury. "They chose not to intervene and stop Chauvin as he killed a man slowly in front of their eyes on a public street in broad daylight."  She said that the officers had sworn an oath to care for people in their custody, and were required by law to stop Chauvin.  Defence lawyers say the three defendants had a right and a duty to arrest Floyd on suspicion he used a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes, and were not criminally liable for Chauvin's conduct.  "The death of Mr. Floyd is indeed a tragedy," Robert Paule, a lawyer for Thao, said in his opening statement, in which he described the dangers police officers face in making arrests. "However, a tragedy is not a crime." Prosecutors are seeking to convince the jury in the U.S. District Court in St. Paul that the men willfully failed to help Floyd during what Trepel called Chauvin's "slow-motion killing." The indictment says a person under arrest has a right to "be free from a police officer's deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs."  Thao, 36, and Kueng, 28, face an additional count in the indictment, which says they willfully failed to stop Chauvin using excessive force against a prone, handcuffed Floyd, violating Floyd's right to be free from unreasonable seizure.  Thao had worked for the Minneapolis Police Department for eight years. Lane, 38, and Kueng, who helped restrain Floyd's lower body, had joined only a few months prior to the arrest, and Chauvin was their field training officer.  Kueng was "a rookie officer" on his third shift ever on the job and was let down by his seniors with "inadequate training," his lawyer Thomas Plunkett told the jury. He grew up in a racially diverse household and had hoped to change the police department "from within," Plunkett said.  The jury will hear from other Minneapolis police officers who will testify that the three defendants were trained in how to administer medical aid to people in their custody, and taught that simply moving Floyd onto his side could have saved his life, Trepel said.  They will also hear from some of the horrified bystanders who shouted at the officers to check Floyd's pulse as he said repeatedly that he could not breathe, Trepel said.  "After Mr. Floyd lost the ability to speak, the people on the sidewalk stood up for him," Trepel told the jury. "They understood just by seeing his body go limp, listening to his words and then listening to his silence that, unless somebody changed what was happening, he would die."  After the federal trial, the three men still face a state trial for aiding and abetting the murder of Floyd.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/3-ex-police-officers-were-indifferent-to-floyds-pleas-jury-told-in-opening-remarks-in-fed-trial/articleshow/89101467.cms||---

White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters the United States “has never ruled out” the option of providing assistance to eastern flank countries “in advance of any invasion” of Ukraine by Russia. President Joe Biden met his national security team at his Camp David retreat on Saturday and was briefed on options for deploying more U.S. troops to NATO allies in eastern Europe in response to Russia's military buildup along Ukraine's border. Biden was to hold a secure video call with a number of European leaders later on Monday from the White House Situation Room to discuss the Ukraine crisis.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-refining-its-military-plans-for-all-scenarios-on-ukraine-crisis-white-house/articleshow/89101478.cms||---

It will contest from 65 constituencies, while its allies — former CM Captain Amarinder Singh’s Punjab Lok Congress and S S Dhindsa’s faction of Akali Dal, SAD (Sanyukt), will contest from 37 and 17 respectively, BJP chief J P Nadda said on Monday. It is the first time in over two decades BJP is playing the role of senior partner in an alliance in Punjab. It had earlier played second fiddle to the Akalis, leading to considerable heartburn among its cadres who used to argue subservience to Badals fettered the growth of the saffron outfit in the state. Nadda announced the seat-sharing agreement at a press conference at the BJP headquarters in the presence of allies Amarinder Singh and Dhindsa. Hailing Punjab as a “leader”, especially in defence and food security of the country, Nadda said, “Today Punjab needs special attention, it needs a double-engine government and better coordination between the Centre and the state.” “I am announcing a broader seat-sharing agreement. BJP will contest on 65 seats, PLC on 37 seats and SAD (Sanyukt) on 15 seats,” Nadda said. Speaking at the same conference, Singh said for the sake of national security and welfare of the state, all three parties have come together. Expressing concern about the threat to the “hard-earned” peace of Punjab, Singh said a large number of weapons for carrying out nefarious activities are coming into Punjab. “During the course of my last four-and-half-years as Punjab chief minister, at least 1,000 rifles, 500 pistols, RDX, lakhs of rounds of ammunition were caught at the borders. The weapons were also dropped using drones... They were meant for carrying out some nefarious activities,” Singh said. Elections for 117-seat assembly in Punjab will be held in single phase on February 20. The state is set to witness a five-cornered contest this election between BJP and its allies, Congress, AAP, SAD and the farmers' political outfit.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-to-contest-65-punjab-seats-allies-plc-37-and-sad-sanyukt-17/articleshow/89101619.cms||---

---||Business||Amazon faces flak on social media for allegedly insulting Indian flag||NEW DELHI: Amazon on Monday faced the ire of a section of Indian social media users over merchandising some products, including apparel and food items, that feature images of the Indian flag, with some saying that using the tricolour in such a way was an insult and a violation of the country's flag code. In a late evening statement, Amazon said it remains committed to take necessary action against sellers who may have listed any non-compliant products. Netizens shared pictures of items like apparel, cups, keychains and chocolates that feature images or imprint of the tricolour on Amazon.in website, and sought a ban on these items. Hashtags like #AmazonInsultsNationalFlag were trending on Twitter. When contacted, Amazon said Amazon.in is an online marketplace where third-party sellers offer products for sale directly to customers, and as such are responsible for ensuring compliances associated with the sale of these products. "We require all products offered on the marketplace to comply with applicable laws and constantly take appropriate action on non-compliance. Amazon remains committed to take necessary action against sellers who may have listed any non-compliant products," the company said. Some social media users noted that using the tricolour on products is against the Flag Code Of India, 2002. A section of the social media users said such usage is an insult to the national flag while others pointed out that it was a cheap method of increasing sales and that this will not increase the patriotism of Indian citizens. "The flag shall not be used as a portion of costume or uniform of any description. It shall not be embroidered or printed upon cushions, handkerchiefs, napkins or boxes," as per the Code. This is not the first time that Amazon is facing such a backlash. In 2017, Amazon was forced to remove doormats depicting Indian flag that were listed on its Canadian website after a strong protest by India.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/amazon-faces-flak-on-social-media-for-allegedly-insulting-indian-flag/articleshow/89100691.cms||---
---||Delhi||Double masks, social distancing, no mingling at the camp: Josh is high as NCC cadets prep for R-Day parade amid COVID||The cadets at the NCC Republic Day Camp say that this is a dream come true for them – an opportunity they didn’t want to miss despite the pandemic. Attending the Republic Day Camp (RDC) is a dream for every NCC cadet. Those preparing themselves for the camp say that they have not only been focussing on their drill and presentation, but also making sure that they are fit and healthy amid the pandemic. This year, only cadets from Senior Division and Senior Wing have been allowed – those who are fully vaccinated. From getting an RT-PCR done before coming to Delhi, then completing their isolation period for seven days, followed by another RT-PCR to then finally living in a bio-bubble, these cadets are making sure that they are not mingling with people from other contingents, and following all COVID protocols as they prep for parade. But none of this has deterred their joshto be at RDC and living their dream of finally marching at Rajpath on January 26. The cadets at the NCC Republic Day Camp say that this is a dream come true for them – an opportunity they didn’t want to miss despite the pandemicCadets share that they have been taking extra care of their health to be fit for the RDC and have been following all precautions at the camp, including not mingling with other contingents to maintain social distancingSom Shankar Dubey, 19 | Directorate: Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh ‘Have experienced unity in diversity here'RDC is a dream camp for every cadet when I came to my college, I joined NCC and was able to make it here. Here, I’ve been able to experience unity in diversity. We wear double masks, have separate timings for our meals and even maintain social distancing during drills briefs. Alpana Singh, 20 | Directorate: Maharashtra 'Following all protocols to avoid any risks'Cadets have been following all protocols to avoid any risks. This is an opportunity that we cannot let go of. Since my first year in college, I have been preparing for RDC. Marching at Rajpath will always be a proud moment for me. When you march there, people look at you and that was always the dream. And this is something that can motivate other girls as well. Marry Malling, 21 | Directorate: North Eastern Region ‘Despite COVID, I was sure about coming here'This is a one-time opportunity and I have put all my josh. Here, I’ve learnt that anything is possible if you give your best. Despite COVID, I was sure about coming here. I knew I wanted to give my best for this opportunity because it’ll never come back. Ashish Yadav, 19 | Directorate: Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Chandigarh ‘Took care of my health specifically this year because I did not want to miss the opportunity'I got to know about RDC from my seniors and wanted to have the same experience. The discipline was one thing that everyone talked about. Last year, I wanted to attend RDC but couldn’t due to personal reasons and this was my last chance, so I took care of my health because I couldn’t miss this opportunity. Jarnish Bandral, 19 | Directorate: Jammu, Kashmir & Ladakh ‘Taking care of our health has been the topmost priority of all cadets'I’ve got a lot of exposure here and marching at Rajpath made me proud of myself. It was one of the things that we’ve been seeing on TV and to do it finally myself was surreal. Taking care of our health was the topmost priority of every cadet who is here. Aryan, 19 | Directorate: Delhi ‘Trained ourselves at home since colleges were shut due to COVID' For an NCC cadet, RDC is one of the elite camps, and I knew I had to keep myself safe. We trained at home last year because colleges were shut due to COVID-19. We had to prepare ourselves like that. I was motivated to come here because of my seniors. When my seniors came back from RDC, they were disciplined and that inspired me to come here. Ishwarya Jose, 19 | Directorate: Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Andaman & Nicobar ‘Even while having food, we have been allotted separate timings'  It’s a dream of every cadet to be here. Before we came here, we took an RT-PCR test and after coming here, we were quarantined, and then we took another RT-PCR. After being selected for Rajpath, we were isolated from others, and been following all COVID protocols like wearing double masks, using sanitisers and maintaining social distancing. Even while having food, we have been allotted separate timings. Roshini Mariyan MA, 20 | Directorate: Karnataka and Goa ‘Temperature checks are done twice a day'Along with other COVID protocols, temperature checks are done twice a day. I could not come to the camp when I was in school, so I joined college only with the thought of taking part in the RDC. At RDC, I have learnt not to give up. Before coming here, I could not walk much but now we are walking over 3km with a rifle so it has taught me to never give up, and that will stay with me for the rest of my life. Pramila Kunwar, 18 | Directorate: Karnataka and Goa 'Joined NCC for RDC'It is a dream of every cadet to be here, I also had the same josh. I took part in various camps so that I was prepared for RDC and the main reason to join NCC was to be a part of RDC so I had to do this. We have thermal screening twice a day at the camp, we have been maintaining social distancing and have also been making sure that we don’t mingle with others. Aum Mudaliar, 19 | Directorate: Maharashtra ‘We are not mingling with other contingents to maintain social distancing'My father is also a former cadet. Unfortunately, he could not make it to RDC and I did, so he is really proud of me. We wear double masks and maintain social distancing. Even when we go to Rajpath, we make sure not to mingle with other contingents.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/double-masks-social-distancing-no-mingling-at-the-camp-josh-is-high-as-ncc-cadets-prep-for-r-day-parade-amid-covid/articleshow/89097598.cms||Riya Sharma
---||Mumbai||Demand for R-Day products remain low in Mumbai this year||For most Mumbaikars, the R-Day week would spell big business, not just for the retail sector and mall owners, but even for small shops and vendors at signals selling R-Day merchandise like Tri-colour flags, flag stands with self-adhesive stickers, metal flag pins, magnets, tri-colour wrist bands, caps, dupattas and T-shirts.  But this year, like last year, the business is down owing to the pandemic situation. ‘Merchandise sale just didn’t pick up this year’ Arun Kamble, a shop owner near a suburban local train station, shares, “Aaj bhi mere saare Tri-Colour T-shirts pade hain. Before the pandemic, pre-Republic Day sales would pick up a week earlier. In the last two years very few people bought anything.”  A Byculla- based company, specialised in making flags, has seen a sharp decline in the orders. Owner Gyan Shah says, “Offices, government organisations and private building societies would order flags from us. Things changed after the pandemic struck. This year we have seen a 60 per cent decline in orders and sales of flags.”  Another reason for the slide in sales of R-Day merchandise is that there are many who do not want to step out. Bhavika Thakkar, a homemaker, says, “I prefer purchasing things online and have avoided going out much. I would always buy Tri-colour T-shirts and wrist bands for my son. This year due to restrictions we will not be doing any of that.”  Apart from small stalls and vendors, general stores in the city would also be seen selling R-Day merchandise. But, things have changed now. “Just like last year, there is no demand at all this year too. I have bought less than 50 percent of the stock that I would usually buy and I am selling limited number of flags, magnets and flag pins. Hardly anything has been bought this year,” says Amritlal, a small store owner. ‘There aren’t many vendors at signals’ Sonu Singh, a media person, who bought a car last year, says he has always liked having a tiny flag on his dashboard along with a Ganpati idol. “Usually a week before Republic Day, all kinds of R-Day merch come up in local markets, near stations and especially at signals. This year it was tough to spot a vendor. I finally spotted one and managed to purchase what I was looking for.,” he says.  Footfalls in stores across Mumbai have also taken a hit, say retailers. “As compared to last month, January 2022 has seen almost a 55- 60 percent less footfall. People across the city are no longer going out shopping,” says a spokesperson from a mall.  Arjun Rathod, a tech professional from Mira Road, feels that the pandemic has changed multiple things and that has affected the overall R-Day buzz in the city. “Since people are home- bound and there are no gatherings, there is no buzz. No one is buying tri-coloured T-shirts because they are going to be at home. Our office would give us sticker flags when we went to work, but now we are working from home.” ‘With schools reopening sale might pick up’ After the State Government allowed schools to reopen in Mumbai on Monday, vendors say they are hoping for better sales. “Children usually buy flags for Republic Day and so we are hoping to do some business in the next two days. On the morning of R-Day, sales may pick up. But, in the  current situation I am not expecting that much,” says Bhagwati, a store owner from suburban Mumbai. ‘I don’t buy R-Day merch anymore’Young mothers from the city have a different point of view when it comes to buying patriotic merchandise, especially flags on R-Day. Gandhali Paranjpe, co-founder of a sports company and mother of twins, says, “I stopped buying flags a few years ago because by the end of the week, or max in a month's time it all lies about gathering dust and I feel that is the biggest insult to the Tricolor.” Aparna Achrekar, an entrepreneur, and partner at a digital start-up, agrees. She says, “Honestly once the plastic or paper tears, the most difficult part is disposing it. To me, a disfigured flag is like a chopped idol of God. There should be a code of what you should do with those small flags after R-Day. And also my teenaged child has outgrown buying Tri-colour caps and wristbands.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/demand-for-r-day-products-remain-low-this-year/articleshow/89110415.cms||Debarati S Sen

The Kishore Biyani-led Future Group firm said due to the continued impact of the Covid-19, the restricted business operations of the company and the current financial situation, the liquidity position has still remained affected. "This has caused us to miss the service of the payment of interest due on the dollar Notes (listed on Singapore Stock Exchange) on January 24, 2022," Future Retail Ltd (FRL) said in a regulatory filing. The terms of issuance of the dollar Notes provides for an additional period of 30 days for payment of interest from the due date, in case FRL misses the original due date, it added. "Accordingly, we are proposing to make payment of the interest within additional period of 30 days from the interest due date on the dollar Notes," said FRL. The Senior Secured Notes notes had an interest on 5.60 per cent and due in 2025. Earlier, this month FRL had missed the "Due Date" for payment of Rs 3,494.56 crore to the banks as it failed to sell its assets due to its ongoing litigation with amazon impacting its monetisation plans. In August 2020, the Future group had announced Rs 24,713 crore deal for sale of the retail and wholesale business, and the logistics and warehousing business to Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd, a subsidiary of Reliance Industries Ltd.However, its e-commerce major Amazon is contesting the deal through its 49 per cent stake in Future Coupons Pvt Ltd (FCPL), which is a shareholder in Future Retail. The matter is presently in dispute before the Supreme Court and Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC). Reliance Retail Ventures had for the second time extended the timeline for completing its Rs 24,713 crore deal with Future group to March 31, 2022 as it still awaits regulatory and judicial clearances.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/future-retail-misses-servicing-of-interest-payment-on-dollar-notes/articleshow/89101771.cms||---

---||India||Egyptian mummy showcases keep safe our Constitution||A little rain in Delhi on January 24, 1950 did not dampen the spirits of the members of the Constituent assembly. Huddled together, in the Constitution (now Central) Hall of Parliament, they were anxiously waiting for assembly proceedings to begin at 11am for the last time. There were two critical items on the day’s agenda. First was the election of the President of India. This one was momentous but straightforward because Dr Rajendra Prasad was the only candidate for the position. The second item was more personal. That day, each member would sign a document that would guide independent India’s destiny — the Constitution of India. Constituent assembly members signed three copies of the Constitution. PM Jawahar Lal Nehru was the first to sign since he had to leave early and Dr Prasad the last. One was a printed copy in English, and two were in English and Hindi hand-lettered by two expert calligraphers. Artists from Shantiniketan also decorated each page of the calligraphed versions. The two calligraphed Constitution copies are kept in the library of Parliament, and the institution shoulders the responsibility of preserving them for the nation. Their preservation is critical because written documents get damaged by prolonged environmental exposure. Inks and colours fade, plus air pollutants and insect infestation can irreparably damage paper. In the mid-eighties, the Indian Parliament and the Egyptian government started looking for preservation solutions. The former for the two calligraphed Constitutions, and the latter for 27 royal mummies. The Egyptians reached out to the Getty Conservation Institute (GCI) in the United States. Dr Shin Maekawa, a Japanese-born American, led GCI’s project to design a storage and display case for the mummies. An engineer by training, Dr Maekawa had worked at the NASA-owned Jet Propulsion Lab before joining GCI. He laid stringent design parameters for the oxygen-free cases for the royal mummies. They had to be readily manufacturable, low maintenance and cost-effective. The Parliament of India reached out to the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in Delhi for developing a case for preserving the Constitution. The point man at NPL for this project was its scientist Dr Hari Kishan. He would later go on to head NPL’s Quantum Phenomena and Applications division. Dr Kishan would work extensively to fabricate a glass case with some success. The missing piece of the problem was a seal on the edges of the display case that guaranteed it remained airtight and no oxygen could leak into it. While visiting France to develop a glass case, he would learn about GCI’s efforts in designing similar cases for the Egyptian mummies. Dr Maekawa and the GCI team had successfully made a sealed display case to ensure that minimal oxygen would leak into it over an extended period. In 1993, GCI and NPL agreed to collaboratively design, install and test GCI’s hermetically sealed cases for the preservation and display of the Constitution. A year later, GCI would ship two display cases for the English and Hindi versions of the Constitution to India. And after a year of testing, the two copies of the Constitution were placed in the airtight nitrogen-filled cases in 1995. Since then, a team of NPL scientists has carried out annual checks on the working of the two display cases. The work done by Dr Shin Maekawa and Dr Hari Kishan has ensured the preservation of the calligraphed Constitutions that were signed 73 years ago for future generations. While their efforts protect the physical book, the people of India have to preserve the letter and spirit of the Constitution. As former Supreme Court Justice H R Khanna, who upheld civil liberties during the Emergency, wrote: “A constitution is not a parchment of paper; it is a way of life. Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty and, in the final analysis, its only keepers are the people.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/egyptian-mummy-showcases-keep-safe-our-constitution/articleshow/89101788.cms||Chakshu Roy

Vodafone Idea MD and CEO Ravinder Takkar during the earnings call said that the minimum price of Rs 99 set by the company for about a month long service is not an expensive proposition for those who are using 4G services. "We would expect that its possible that there could be another price hike in 2022 but certainly at some point the price hike will take place. The last one was almost 2 years earlier which I believe is a bit long. We certainly would expect less than two years but in 2022 we will have to see how quickly these prices get embedded. Probably, it could be 2023 as well," Takkar said. VIL subscriber base declined to 24.72 crore from 26.98 crore in the year-ago period because of increase in services rate by the company. Despite the tariff hike, its average revenue per user (ARPU) declined by about 5 per cent to Rs 115, compared to Rs 121 in the same quarter of 2020-21. Debt-ridden telecom operator Vodafone Idea last week reported widening of its consolidated loss to Rs 7,230.9 crore for the third quarter ended December 2021. The company had posted a loss of Rs 4,532.1 crore in the same period a year ago. Consolidated revenue from operations declined by 10.8 per cent to Rs 9,717.3 crore from Rs 10,894.1 crore in the corresponding quarter of 2020-21. VIL's total gross debt, excluding lease liabilities and including interest accrued but not due, as of December 31, 2021 stood at Rs 1,98,980 crore, comprising of deferred spectrum payment obligations of Rs 1,11,300 crore, AGR liability of Rs 64,620 crore that are due to the government and debt from banks and financial institutions of Rs 23,060 crore. The company's cash and cash equivalents were Rs 1,500 crore and net debt stood at Rs 1,97,480 crore. The debt-ridden company has opted to pay interest of around Rs 16,000 crore through preferential share. This will result in the government holding 35.8 per cent stake in the company. VIL CFO Akshaya Moondra said that the conversion of debt into equity will reduce interest charge by Rs 1,600 crore on an annual basis.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/vodafone-idea-expects-another-hike-in-mobile-services-rates-this-year/articleshow/89101833.cms||---

The Nomura India Business Resumption Index (NIBRI) -- which compares the activity in a particular week with that of the pre-pandemic levels -- fell further to 100.5 for the week ended January 23 from 102.2 in the previous week, the Japanese brokerage said. The index fell because of a fall in the mobility levels as seen in the Google workplace and retail and recreation mobility, which fell by 10.7 percentage points (pp) and 4.4 pp, respectively, while the Apple driving index inched 1.7 pp higher after a massive 84 pp fall over the past two weeks. The labour participation rate inched up to 39.8 per cent. The rate of increase of new cases has moderated even as new infections breached the 3 lakh a day mark from being at the 2.5 lakh level in the week-ago period, it said, pointing out that Delhi and West Bengal have reported lower rates. Air traffic is a third lower than the peak achieved in December before the onset of the third wave but railway passenger revenues have stabilised, it said, adding that activity should improve in February or March.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/business-activity-dips-to-pre-pandemic-levels-amid-third-covid-wave-report/articleshow/89101868.cms||---

The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), that frames policy for the income tax department, had on January 18 notified the rules stating the method of calculation of capital gains with regard to ULIPs with annual premium of more than Rs 2.5 lakh and subsequently issued a circular the next day charting out various aspects of their taxation. Income-tax department sources told PTI that the rules and guidelines were notified by the CBDT to give effect to the announcement made with regard to ULIPs in the last Union Budget. These do not bring any new taxation provision but only clarify the method of calculation of capital gains when it comes to redeeming ULIPs in specified cases, they said. "The Finance Act of 2021 carried out amendment in section 10(10D) of the Income-tax Act following which the sum received under ULIPs issued on or after Feb 1, 2021, shall not be exempt if the annual premium payable for any year exceeds Rs 2.50 lakh. "This provision was enacted to create level playing field between mutual fund investment and ULIP investment," a senior I-T department official said. Clarifying the various aspects and concerns over the taxation of ULIP redemptions in certain cases, the official said the move was made after it was found that ULIPs were being preferred by investors for investment purposes as compared to insurance. "In case of mutual funds, its redemption is charged to capital gains tax. However, in case of ULIP the redemption was exempt, even though the insurance part of the premium was very less and investment part of the premium was high," the official said. Another official said that this amendment in the Finance Act of 2021 "ensured" that both mutual fund units and ULIPs operate on the "same footing." "However, a general exemption was provided to those cases where annual premium is not more than 2.5 lakh in a year. This 2.5 lakh benefit was provided for ULIPs (even if it was not there for mutual fund) so that premium paid for life insurance part does not get hit," the official said. The second official quoted above added that the Finance Act of 2021 also inserted sub-section (1B) in section 45 of the Income-tax Act to make income from ULIPs "taxable as capital gains" just like redemption from mutual fund is taxable as capital gains. "The amendment (in the Finance Act of 2021) also made it clear that if there is more than one policy, the Rs 2.5 lakh premium limit for a year would be applied by aggregating the premium of such policies. "Hence, there was a need for providing clarity by way of a circular, informing the investors how taxable income is to be calculated when there is more than one ULIP ," the second officer quoted above said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/wealth/mutual-funds/taxation-of-ulip-proceeds-to-create-level-playing-field-with-mfs-i-t-department/articleshow/89101891.cms||---

Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said Monday no final decisions had been made on deployments, which he said would happen only if the Nato alliance decides to activate a rapid-response force “or if other situations develop” in connection with tensions over Russia's military buildup along Ukraine's borders. “What this is about is reassurance to our Nato allies," Kirby said, adding that no troops are intended for deployment to Ukraine itself. Kirby further said defense secretary Lloyd Austin recommended to Biden that up to 8,500 troops be ordered to prepare for potential deployment to Europe in light of signs that Russian President Vladimir Putin is not de-escalating his military pressure on Ukraine. Kirby said he was not prepared to identify the US-based units because they were still being notified. “We’ve always said we would reinforce our allies on the eastern flank, and those conversations and discussions have certainly been part of what our national security officials have been discussing with their counterparts now for several weeks,” said White House press secretary Jen Psaki. Later Monday, Biden was to hold a video call with several European leaders on the Russian military build-up and potential responses to an invasion, the White House said. The Pentagon's move comes as tensions have soared between Russia and the West over concerns that Moscow is planning to invade Ukraine, with Nato outlining potential troop and ship deployments, Britain saying it would withdraw some diplomats from Kyiv, and Ireland denouncing upcoming Russian war games off its coast. Prior to the US announcement, the Western alliance’s statement summed up moves already described by member countries, but restating them under the Nato banner appeared aimed at showing resolve. The West is ramping up its rhetoric in the information war that has accompanied the Ukraine standoff. Russia has massed an estimated 100,000 troops near Ukraine’s border, demanding that Nato promise it will never allow Ukraine to join and that other actions, such as stationing alliance troops in former Soviet bloc countries, be curtailed. Some of these, like any pledge to permanently bar Ukraine, are nonstarters for Nato — creating a deadlock that many fear can only end in war. Russia denies it is planning an invasion, and says the Western accusations are merely a cover for Nato’s own planned provocations. Recent days have seen high-stakes diplomacy that failed to reach any breakthrough and maneuvering on both sides. Nato said Monday it is bolstering its “deterrence” in the Baltic Sea region. Denmark is sending a frigate and deploying F-16 warplanes to Lithuania; Spain is sending four fighter jets to Bulgaria and three ships to the Black Sea to join Nato naval forces; and France stands ready to send troops to Romania. The Netherlands also plans to send two F-35 fighter aircraft to Bulgaria from April. Nato will “take all necessary measures to protect and defend all allies,” Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said. "We will always respond to any deterioration of our security environment, including through strengthening our collective defense.” In Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was Nato and the U.S. who were behind the escalating tensions, not Russia. “All this is happening not because of what we, Russia, are doing. This is happening because of what Nato, the U.S. are doing,” Peskov told reporters. The Nato announcement came as European Union foreign ministers sought to put on a fresh display of unity in support of Ukraine, and paper over concerns about divisions on the best way to confront any Russian aggression. In a statement, the ministers said the EU has stepped up sanction preparations and they warned that “any further military aggression by Russia against Ukraine will have massive consequences and severe costs.” Separately, the EU also committed to increase financial support for embattled Ukraine, vowing to push through a special package of 1.2 billion euros ($1.4 billion) in loans and grants as soon as possible. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken held talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Friday and said the U.S. would give Russia written responses to Moscow’s proposals this week, offering some hope that any invasion could be delayed for at least a few more days. The West is nervously watching Russian troop movements and war games in Belarus for any signs of an invasion. Russia has already invaded Ukraine once, annexing the Crimean Peninsula in 2014. It also supported pro-Russian Ukrainian separatists fighting the Kyiv government in the country's eastern region known as the Donbass. About 14,000 people have been killed in the conflict. Asked whether the EU would follow a U.S. move and order the families of European embassy personnel in Ukraine to leave, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said: “We are not going to do the same thing.” Britain said it is withdrawing some diplomats and dependents from its Kyiv Embassy. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said an invasion was not inevitable, but “the intelligence is pretty gloomy.” He added that "I think that sense can still prevail.” Ukraine's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Oleg Nikolenko, said the U.S. decision was “a premature step” and a sign of “excessive caution.” He said Russia is sowing panic among Ukrainians and foreigners in order to destabilize Ukraine. Germany has issued no similar order, with Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock stressing that “we must not contribute to unsettling the situation further." At the EU meeting, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said he would inform his counterparts about planned Russian war games 240 kilometers (150 miles) off southwestern Ireland — in international waters but within Ireland's exclusive economic zone. “This isn’t a time to increase military activity and tension in the context of what’s happening with and in Ukraine.” he said. “The fact that they are choosing to do it on the western borders, if you like, of the EU, off the Irish coast, is something that in our view is simply not welcome.” NATO members Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania said they plan to send U.S.-made anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles to Ukraine, a move endorsed by Washington. In talks with European allies throughout the crisis, administration officials said they have remained cognizant that Europe’s trade, energy and financial linkages with Russia are far more significant than they are for the U.S. Russia's brittle economy is overly reliant on energy exports. President Vladimir Putin has made clear his ambition to diversify the economy, particularly in sectors like defense and civil aviation, but the U.S. and European allies have a dominant position in producing and exporting the technologies, software and equipment crucial for Russia in those sectors. Throughout the talks, European officials have underscored having a “legitimate analysis and understanding of... what will actually make Russia hurt” and what the “collateral costs” might be, according to a second senior administration official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/us-puts-8500-troops-on-alert-amid-ukraine-crisis/articleshow/89102179.cms||---

We feel proud when we see that the youth of India are innovating, taking the country forward,” the PM said at the virtual awards ceremony in which he conferred select children with the “Pradhan Mantri Rashtriya Bal Puraskar” for accomplishments across fields, including innovation. The PM awarded certificates to the recipients digitally using block chain technology. The PM also lauded the children for showing their “modern and scientific thinking” in the vaccination programme. “Since January 3, in just 20 days, more than 40 million children have got the corona vaccine,” he said. Highlighting the leadership children have shown in the Swachch Bharat Abhiyan, he appealed to them to be ambassadors for “Vocal for Local” and lead the campaign of ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’. Modi said policies and initiatives in all sectors are keeping youth at the centre. He cited initiatives like Start-Up India, Stand Up India, Digital India and Make in India. This, he said, is in sync with the speed of the youth of India, who are leading this new epoch both here and abroad. Among those present at the ceremony was women and child development Minister Smriti Irani. The prime minister also remembered the contribution of Birbala Kanaklata Barua, Khudiram Bose and Rani Gaidinilu to the freedom struggle. “These fighters had made the country’s freedom the mission of their lives at a very young age and dedicated themselves for it,” he said. Talking about the unveiling of a hologram statue of freedom fighter Subhas Chandra Bose at the India Gate, he said, “The biggest inspiration we get from Netaji is of duty and of nation first, and you have to proceed on your path of duty for the country.” He also recalled his visit to the Nowshera sector of Jammu and Kashmir on Diwali last year where he met Baldev Singh and Basant Singh who had played the role of child soldiers in the post-independence war. They helped our army at such a young age without caring about their life. The Prime Minister cited examples of the bravery and sacrifice of the sons of Guru Gobind Singh. Twenty-nine children, including 14 girls, were awarded in six fields - innovation, scholastic achievements, sports, arts and culture, social service and bravery. Each child has been given a medal, a cash prize of Rs 1,00,000 and a certificate. The PM also greeted everyone on the occasion of National Girl Child Day.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-toasts-young-innovators-indian-ceos-of-global-majors/articleshow/89101862.cms||---
---||Business||Budget: Increase in trade infra spending to boost exports||NEW DELHI: An increase in budgetary allocation for creation of trade infra will boost exports, said Crisil Research. Notably, it said the budget should focus on developing infrastructure in shipping and logistics to reduce time and non-tariff costs. "Exports in India have historically ridden the global growth wave. But when that recedes, as expected this calendar year, exports cannot rely on external demand alone to prop it up. India also needs to consolidate the recently seen increase in share of industrial or investment goods in overall merchandise trade, Crisil Research said. "To tackle both these, the budget's focus on developing infrastructure in shipping and logistics to reduce time and non-tariff costs of trading across borders will be imperative." Further, it said that an increased budgetary allocation in the form of 'grants-in-aid', as envisaged under the trade infrastructure for exports scheme, which seeks to create first or last mile connectivity for export-oriented projects, will drive the objective of enhancing competitiveness. Besides, Crisil Research said facilitating finance and insurance cover for exports should be another focal point of the budget. Last year, after the budget, the ministry of finance had announced 'grant-in-aid' infusion of Rs 1,650 crore for the National Export Insurance Account (NEIA) to underwrite Rs 33,000 crore of project exports in the FY22-26 period. The NEIA aims to ensure the availability of credit risk cover for project exports. "The progress on this front has been relatively slow this year " according to the ministry of commerce, the NEIA supported exports worth only Rs 91.4 crore by issuing insurance cover worth Rs 58 crore between May-August 2021. This initiative could be expedited through announcing steps to support project exports. In addition, it cited that the budget should focus on the opportunity of the China-plus-one policy. "Relentless focus on electronic and electric exports will be important to take advantage of this." "The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme is a good starting point for this." Thus, a serious effort to reach the $1 trillion target for merchandise exports needs to begin with this budget "by initiating measures in terms of infrastructure spending, reduction in tariff costs, and enhancement of credit risk cover to facilitate trade."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-increase-in-trade-infra-spending-to-boost-exports/articleshow/89101936.cms||---
---||World||Jihadist fighters holed up with minors in Syria prison||HASAKEH: Kurdish forces geared up Monday for an assault on a prison in northeast Syria that Islamic State group fighters stormed last week, sparking fears for the fate of hundreds of under-age detainees.  IS fighters on Thursday rammed two explosives-packed vehicles into the Kurdish-run Ghwayran prison to launch a brazen jailbreak operation that has plunged the city of Hasakeh into chaos.  The attack is the group's biggest since their once sprawling self-styled "caliphate" was defeated in 2019. It has already killed more than 150 people, most of them jihadists.  Fighting drove some 45,000 residents of Syria's largest Kurdish city to flee their homes, according to the United Nations, but the violence receded on Monday with the presence of hundreds of children inside the prison complicating an assault.  The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said US-backed Kurdish forces "started to infiltrate the part of the prison that remains under the control of IS fighters," after freeing several Kurdish fighters and prison staff held captive by the group. The IS fighters were holed up in one building on the northern side of the prison, according to the war monitoring group.  The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces said that around 300 IS fighters had surrendered to its forces following a raid on one of the buildings housing holdout jihadists.  An AFP correspondent in the area saw buses and military vehicles transferring what appeared to be IS fighters out of the prison.  The semi-autonomous Kurdish authorities running the region imposed a state of emergency across Hasakeh, after at least seven civilians were killed in the crossfire.  According to rights groups and the UN, more than 700 minors are thought be held in Ghwayran, a former school converted into a detention facility that is badly overcrowded, housing at least 3,500 suspected IS members. Eva Hinds, spokeswoman for UN childrens' agency UNICEF, said the plight of the trapped minors, around 10 percent of whom are believed to be 15 or younger, was a source of "grave concern".  "The SDF initially allocated a special section for children," Hinds said. "Many of them have adult relatives inside and have since joined them in other sections."  Sara Kayyali, Syria researcher at Human Rights Watch, said: "These children are effectively trapped in Ghwayran prison."  HRW heard voice messages from an injured minor at Ghwayran who reported "there are dead bodies everywhere," Kayyali said.  "It's not clear if they have any kind of medical assistance," she added, explaining that most of the minors were aged between 12 and 18.  Save the Children said it had also received audio testimony indicating that "there have already been multiple child deaths and casualties".  It said the minors in Ghwayran are from dozens of foreign countries, as well as Syria and Iraq.  The SDF, the Kurdish authorities' de facto army, charged in a statement that IS "continues to hold children hostage and is using them as human shields to protect themselves" from a counter-offensive. The US forces based in the region, who were the main support in the Kurdish offensives that put thousands of jihadists into custody three years ago, deployed heavily in Hasakeh. The US-led coalition helicopters flew overhead as a full curfew was enforced across the city, an AFP correspondent reported.  According to the Observatory war monitor, at least 154 people have been killed since the attack began late on January 20.  Among them were 102 jihadists, 45 members of the Kurdish security forces and seven civilians, Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman said.  Analysts saw the attack on one of the biggest prisons in the region as a sign that IS needs manpower to continue rebuilding following the demise of its "caliphate".  While it is unclear how successful IS will have been at springing fighters from Ghwayran, the operation marks a new step in the jihadist organisation's resurgence.  But analysts also argued that while the IS has trumpeted the attack on its propaganda channels and that it might provide a morale boost for its sympathisers, it would do little to change the military balance on the ground.  In a statement issued Monday, the US-led 'Global Coalition' against IS said the jihadist attack was "a desperate attempt to replenish its depleted ranks and to regain lost momentum."  "The Global Coalition is determined to ensure it fails," it said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/jihadist-fighters-holed-up-with-minors-in-syria-prison/articleshow/89101937.cms||---

In separate replies to questions from one Dhiraj Kumar Gupta, the defence ministry has revealed the total estimated seating capacity at the Republic Day celebrations in the national capital was around 1.06 lakh. In 2019 and 2020, the government had issued around 1.2 lakh invitations and admits cards each year free of cost to government employees and office bearers of committees, commissions under central government, PSUs, autonomous bodies and nationalised banks. It also said that people could buy tickets at Rs 20, Rs 100 and Rs 500 from counters across Delhi but “without any reserved seat”. In 2019, nearly 32,000 such tickets were sold. The number of visitors was drastically pruned in 2021 because of the Covid-19 pandemic and this year it would be far less. Gupta told TOI that the idea to take up this fight against “inequality and VIP culture” struck him in 2015 when he was visiting a government office at Shashtri Bhawan. “Then US President Barack Obama was the chief guest and I saw how there was a long queue outside a counter where tickets for the Republic Day parade were sold. Many were going back with disappointment and they were being asked to come back in the afternoon. I felt when this is a national celebration why the common man has to struggle to get a ticket while government officers and VIPs could get them easily and that too free of cost,” he said. Gupta said he started pursuing the issue and after getting responses of how people had to buy tickets. He also made suggestions to the government. “Why can’t the government make it free for all and have an online booking of passes? Why can’t people living in other parts of India get them and can plan their visit?” he asked. Till 2020, the tickets were being sold only in Delhi. Gupta has been running a campaign ‘Karbadh Yachna Abhiyan’ to end this “inequality” while arguing that every citizen pays for the parade on Rajpath and hence there can’t be double standards.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/free-passes-got-lions-share-of-r-day-seats-in-2019-and-2020/articleshow/89101945.cms||Dipak K Dash

Youngkin issued the order as one of his first acts after being sworn in as governor January 15, and confusion has swirled over the implications since then. Some districts have interpreted the order as being at odds with a state law that deals with COVID-19 mitigation in schools and have opted to keep pre-existing mask mandates in place for students.  Some observers took to social media over the weekend to urge parents to follow the governor's order, regardless of their school district's position. On Monday, as students reported to classrooms, there were no immediate reports of major issues requiring intervention by law enforcement.  With the order facing a legal challenge filed last week by a group of parents and another filed Monday morning by seven school boards, Youngkin urged patience and asked parents to listen to their children's school principals for the time being.  "Listen to a principal today. And I know that there are some school systems that are doing things that are inconsistent with respecting the rights of parents. ... Let's respect it right now and let this legal process play out," he said in an interview with Richmond radio station WRVA Monday morning.  He seemed to acknowledge the possibility of conflict, saying: "This is not a moment for us to forget that we're all in the same boat and love one another."  Monday's legal challenge was brought by seven schools boards in the state filed a lawsuit in Arlington County Circuit Court seeking to block the executive order.  In a message to parents, Fairfax County Public Schools Superintendent Scott Brabrand he hoped the lawsuit will allow for a swift resolution of the conflict between the governor and local boards that believe a mask mandate is a necessary public health measure.  "It is imperative that decisions about education and school safety are made locally in order to champion the best interests of our students and community," Brabrand said.  In addition to Fairfax, the state's most populous jurisdiction, the school boards in Alexandria, Richmond, Hampton, Falls Church, Arlington County and Prince William County, joined the suit. Collectively, the jurisdictions represent more than 350,000 students.  The lawsuit argues the state constitution gives local school boards the authority to run their districts. It also cites a state law that requires school systems to follow federal health guidelines, which include recommendations for universal masking.  "At issue is whether locally elected school boards will maintain the exclusive authority and responsibility conferred upon them by Article VIII, Section 7 of the Constitution of Virginia to supervise the public schools in their respective school divisions or whether the governor can unilaterally infringe upon that authority through an executive order," the lawsuit states.  Youngkin's spokesperson Macaulay Porter said the administration was disappointed that the school boards were acting counter to parents' rights.  "The governor and attorney general are in coordination and are committed to aggressively defending parents' fundamental right to make decisions with regard to their child's upbringing, education and care, as the legal process plays out," she said in a statement.  Supporters of the executive order say the state law is not in conflict with Youngkin's executive order because the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention only recommends mask-wearing and does not mandate it.  Fairfax County School Board Chair Stella Petarsky said the existing mask mandate has allowed the school system to maintain in-person learning throughout the school year.  "We have held trend transmission levels low," she said. "We have not had to shut a single school because of COVID. We've kept our kids in the classroom, and we're going to do everything in our power to ensure that we continue that."  In Loudoun County, also in northern Virginia, no students were sent home Monday morning for defying the mask order, Wayde Byard, a school district spokesperson said.  Those who refused to wear masks were routed to school auditoriums where they could do virtual work through the school's online platform, he said. Lunch periods were adjusted to ensure maskless students would receive lunch, he said.  At Woodgrove High School, for example, about 30 students out of more than 1,400 refused to wear masks. Four or five parents opted to pull their children. The rest stayed at the school, isolated from masked peers, he said.  He said there were angry parents at a few schools, but principals defused the situations.  "It was pretty much a non-event," Byard said.  Monday's lawsuit comes after a group of parents in Chesapeake field a petition last week at the Virginia Supreme Court challenging the executive order.  The Supreme Court justices took no action on the lawsuit last week and it was not immediately clear if they would do so Monday.  Democrats commended the school boards who challenged Youngkin on Monday and accused him of using children as political pawns.  "Youngkin is quickly on his way to becoming the most divisive and authoritarian governor in our commonwealth's long history," state Sen. Mamie Locke said at a news conference.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/virginia-governor-youngkin-faces-new-lawsuit-as-mask-order-kicks-in/articleshow/89101974.cms||---

They have also suggested fiscal incentives to address logistics challenges, and reduction of income tax on partnerships and LLP's to support MSME players. The Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) said that there is a need to encourage large Indian entities to build an Indian shipping line of global repute as it would help reduce dependence on foreign shipping lines. It said that the export sector is facing major issues due to rising freight cost and its dependence on global shipping companies. "Overseas marketing is a big challenge for exporters, more so for MSMEs, as it entails a very high cost. We need to bring the Double Tax Deduction Scheme for Internationalizations to allow exporters to deduct against their taxable income...A ceiling of USD 5 lakh may be put under the scheme so that the investment and tax deduction are limited," FIEO Director General Ajay Sahai said. Mumbai-based exporter and Chairman Technocraft Industries Sharda Kumar Saraf said that Reimbursement of Duties & Taxes on Export production (RoDTEP) is one of the most important tools to support export marketing, but its present budget of about Rs 40,000 crore, is inadequate. "We hope the finance minister will take cognizance of this fact and provide a suitable budget for RoDTEP," Saraf said. Plastics Export Promotion Council of India (Plexconcil) Chairman Arvind Goenka suggested that the import duty on plastic finished goods should be atleast 5 per cent higher than polymer raw materials. "For instance, import duty on PVC Resin is 10 per cent and that on value added PVC goods is also 10 per cent thereby there is no incentive to boost domestic production," Goenka said. Council for Leather Exports (CLE) Chairman Sanjay Leekha recommended reinstatement of the exemption for duty free import of critical inputs for leather garments and footwear; and extension of the basic customs duty exemption for import of lining and interlining materials. These measures would promote value addition within the country and make the products competitive in the global markets as compared to the goods of competing countries, besides boosting exports, Leekha said. He has also recommended reinstatement of basic customs duty on import of wet blue, crust and finished leathers as the exemption was removed last year. Sharing a similar view, Chairman of Farida Group Rafeeq Ahmed said that steps for the labour intensive sector - leather in the budget will help in creating more jobs and pushing exports. "The government should consider removing import duty on finished leather. Measures should be announced for setting up micro parks for the sector," Ahmed said. Hand Tools Association President S C Ralhan said that the government should announce some provisions to promote container manufacturing in India. "Budget should also consider extending income tax concessions forMSME exporters," Ralhan said. During April-December 2021-22, exports rose 49.66 per cent to $301.38 billion.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/exporters-seek-support-measures-in-budget-to-boost-shipments/articleshow/89101979.cms||---

This braveheart from Andhra Pradesh, who will be celebrating her birthday on Tuesday, held her ground , engaging in a conversation with one of the terrorist for 4 to 5 hours, negotiating and eventually preventing families from being targeted by them. She is one of the 29 awardees for 2022 who were conferred with the “Pradhan Mantri Rashtriya Bal Puraskar” in the bravery category on Monday at a virtual ceremony by PM Modi. In fact, 14 of the awardees were girls, an apt acknowledgement of girl power on National Girl Child Day. Children were awarded for their accomplishments in six fields — innovation, scholastic achievements, sports, arts and culture, social service and bravery. In a first, digital certificates were given to the awardees for the years 2022 and 2021 using blockchain technology developed by IIT Kanpur. Among those who shared their stories with the PM were Remona Evette Pereira, a Bharatnatyam dancer from Karnataka who recalled how after her father’s death her mother did not let the difficult circumstances hinder her ambitions. She credited her mother for helping her in overcoming the fear of dancing on broken glass. The 16-year-old has been performing for 13 years and has won many accolades. Interacting with Master Avi Sharma, an awardee in the scholastics category from Indore, the PM inquired about the secret of his prolific output with regard to various aspects of the Ramayana. Avi, who is also one of the youngest mentors of vedic mathematics, recited some couplets from his abridged version of Ramayana that he has named “Bal Mukhi Ramayana”. Awardees who were seen steering change during the pandemic include Puhabi Chakraborti, 15, who developed a user interface to control a spirometer. Meedhansh Kumar Gupta, 12, developed a portal providing all-related information on Covid-19 on a single platform during the early stage of the pandemic. Aakarsh Kaushal, 17, developed an MIS RTPCR portal to manage the situation of Covid-19 in Haryana’s Karnal district. The project has been expanded to other districts of the state.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/braveheart-maths-wiz-dancer-and-covid-warriors-among-29-to-bag-bal-puraskar/articleshow/89101975.cms||---

According to the ratings agency, the government is also expected to continue its focus on improving connectivity across India and speedy implementation of projects like Bharatmala for the road logistics sector, dedicated freight corridor (DFC) for the railways and Sagarmala for the waterways. The Union government is set to present Budget 2022-23 on February 1. There has been a traction in policy initiatives for the ports sector in the current fiscal with the operationalisation of the Indian Major Ports Act, 2021 and notification of market-based tariffs under the Act, notification of the revised Model Concession Agreement for PPP projects and passage of the Inland Vessel Act, 2021 in both houses of Parliament, Icra said. While these measures are favourable for the sector and will aid in attracting private sector investments, increased budgetary support from the government for flagship projects such as Sagarmala, inland waterways, among others, will provide a boost to the execution pace and investments, it stated. In the past few years, the allocation to Sagarmala and the inland waterway projects in terms of budgetary support has remained low (about Rs 500-600 crore) compared to the cost of planned initiatives under these schemes, indicating a high reliance on private sector participation, Icra said. "In this context, even if the government continues with its past policy and does not introduce higher budgetary allocation to these plans, some incentives or other measures to boost private investor interest that facilitate more active participation could be expected," it noted. Further, any budgetary support for the modernisation of shipyards (public as well as private) or other incentives which will help in meeting the government objective of greater indigenisation of naval contracts will boost manufacturing under the 'Make-in-India programme', as per the note. Icra, in its note, also expects the government to reduce taxes on diesel in the forthcoming Union Budget while at the same time looking for a push for higher absorption of EVs (electric vehicles) particularly for last-mile connectivity through subsidy /incentives. The ratings agency also said there is a need for finalization and implementation of National Logistics Policy for continued push for reforms in the sector to reduce inefficiencies and improve global competitiveness for the logistics sector. Icra also said that the logistics sector requires continued push for higher digitisation and automation to lower compliance costs through policy support besides push towards creation of a skilled workforce for the sector as well as reforms towards upliftment of livelihood of the workforce.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/icra-expects-enhanced-budgetary-support-for-waterways-logistics-sectors-in-budget/articleshow/89102003.cms||---

Releasing its impact-based weather forecast, the Met department said “cold day to severe cold day conditions” are very likely in some pockets over west Madhya Pradesh during the next three days; over Punjab, Haryana-Chandigarh-Delhi and East Madhya Pradesh during the next three days; and over Uttarakhand, West Uttar Pradesh & Saurashtra & Kutch during the next two days. On its impact, the IMD flagged “an increased likelihood” of various illnesses like flu, running/stuffy nose or nosebleed, which usually set in or get aggravated due to prolonged exposure to cold. Though “isolated light rainfall” is very likely over Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh and Uttar Pradesh during the next 24 hours (Tuesday), the weather is thereafter expected to be “dry” before a fresh ‘western disturbance’ which is very likely to affect western Himalayan region from January 29. Meanwhile, other regions too may face chilly weather. Cold wave to severe cold wave conditions are very likely in isolated pockets over Saurashtra and Kutch during the next two days and over Rajasthan on January 27-28. Similarly, cold wave conditions are very likely over the Gujarat region during the next four days; over Rajasthan during the next five days; over west Uttar Pradesh during January 27-29, over north Madhya Maharashtra on January 26-27 and over east Uttar Pradesh on January 28-29. The situation may lead to very dense foggy conditions in Punjab, Delhi-NCR and western UP during the next two days. The IMD said it may “affect some airports, highways and railway routes” in the areas of met- subdivision such as Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh & Delhi; West Uttar Pradesh, East Uttar Pradesh, West Rajasthan and East Rajasthan.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-more-rain-but-colder-days-ahead-predicts-imd/articleshow/89102110.cms||---

The move will also bring closure to a three-decade-old case on the border row in the Supreme Court. “We had fruitful discussions on the border issue with the Assam CM in Guwahati yesterday. Both the state governments are in favour of an out-of-court settlement,” Nagaland CM Neiphiu Rio said in Kohima on Monday. The two states share a 512km border. Rio said delegations of both governments are likely to meet home minister Amit Shah early next month and formulate the process to resolve the dispute. In August last year, the Nagaland assembly adopted a resolution that the dispute with Assam should be settled mutually with the involvement of local communities of both states.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nagaland-and-assam-ready-to-settle-border-row-out-of-court/articleshow/89102156.cms||Prabin Kalita
---||India||India’s vaccination strides impressive, but reaching next billion could be a challenge: World Bank||NEW DELHI: India has made extraordinary progress on Covid-19 vaccination in a short period of time but vaccinating the next billion will require reaching a poorer segment of the population, for whom the main barriers to vaccine access may include knowledge, awareness, proximity and convenience, the World Bank has said. “A greater focus on these aspects of last-mile service delivery may offer the key to bringing the pandemic one step closer to its conclusion,” World Bank economists Arushi Bhatnagar and Owen Smith said in a blog. From the efforts of frontline workers to the rollout of an innovative technology platform, the vaccine campaign has been an impressive all-round achievement to protect India’s population from the virus. But the arrival of the Omicron variant has added greater urgency to Covid vaccination efforts worldwide, and so it will be even more important to sustain the momentum achieved so far, it said. Citing data, the blog said findings suggest that vaccine hesitancy is no longer a major constraint, if indeed it ever was. The share of households stating that they were not willing to receive a Covid vaccine if it was offered free of charge by the government declined from 14% in January to less than 3% by August, the blog said. It said the survey findings also highlighted gaps that remain. “The share of households reporting that at least one member had been vaccinated quadrupled from 17.5% in April to 70.4% in August. Consistent with administrative data, there are significant differences in vaccination rates across states,” according to the blog. The blog notes the findings point to other potential barriers to wider vaccine access. There are significant gaps in vaccine coverage between urban and rural areas (66% vs 52%) and between those with and without mobile internet access (59% vs 51%).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indias-vaccination-strides-impressive-but-reaching-next-billion-could-be-a-challenge-world-bank/articleshow/89102189.cms||---
---||India||Indian students in global survey think way they study will not go back to how it was pre-pandemic||NEW DELHI: 86% of Indian students think that access to digital content has changed the way they learn and 56% think that the way they study will not go back to how it was pre-pandemic. According to a survey, globally 44% of Gen Y and Gen Z respondents expect changes brought in by Covid-19 to become permanent. A new EY report, ‘Are Universities of the Past Still the Future’, argues that universities in advanced economies are facing a number of existential issues in the wake of the pandemic. Based on EY’s analysis about the future of the higher education sector and 29 interviews with university leaders from the US, UK, India, Singapore and Australia, the report finds that universities will quickly need to adapt to a new reality due to demographic shifts, geopolitical challenges, changing workplace demands and high student expectations for a quality digital experience. As per the report, changing attitudes and behaviours toward digital and emerging technologies present new opportunities for universities across the globe to reinvent learning delivery. The generation of students coming through are digital natives. While 77% of the of the Gen Y and Gen Z respondents to the global survey said that the way they use technology changed during the pandemic, this proportion is higher in emerging economies (88% in Indonesia, 86% in India and 85% in Brazil) as against 66% in Scandinavia and 67% in France. Globally 45% of the Gen Y and Gen Z respondents think that the way they study will not go back to how it was pre-pandemic, which again is higher in emerging economies (56% in India and 55% in Brazil) as against Western Europe (32% in France and 35% in Scandinavia). According to the findings of the survey, “Universities are moving to make quality digital learning a part of their core offering. Some are partnering with online learning platforms. A few are partnering with or acquiring digital first universities with fully formed online programs ready to go.” The balance of power will shift from the learning provider to the learner. Now, students have greater choice and flexibility. So, universities must offer courses that are distinctive enough to be selected. “You have to think, what can you be distinctive at? If you have an online offering, it is almost infinitely scalable, but the customer will also be free to choose the best provider. So, you have to offer something really good and distinctive,” said Professor Adam Tickell, vice-chancellor, University of Birmingham, UK. The report suggested greater regulation and accreditation of providers, to help prospective students and employers evaluate the relative value of credentials. “By adopting some form of common standards, the students should be able to transfer their credits across programs and institutions,” professor Souvik Bhattacharyya, vice-chancellor, Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-students-in-global-survey-think-way-they-study-will-not-go-back-to-how-it-was-pre-pandemic/articleshow/89102293.cms||Manash Pratim Gohain
---||Mumbai||Sensex dives 1,500 points on selling by foreign funds||MUMBAI: As fears about rising inflation stoked rate hike fears across several markets around the world, strong selling by investors on Dalal Street pulled down the sensex by over 2,000 points in late trades on Monday. However, some buying at lower levels in the closing hour helped the index to close at 57,492, down 1,546 points on the day. A rumour about a hike in long term capital gains tax rate in the Budget, which was later denied by the government, also added to investors' nervousness, market players said. In the last five sessions, the sensex has lost nearly 4,000 points, from its recent closing high at 61,309 on January 17. One of the main reasons for this slide is the selling by select foreign funds, market players said. If interest rates in the world's leading economies go up to rein in inflation, that would make getting money expensive and hence these fund managers are taking some money off risky emerging markets, including India, analysts said. Recent data bolsters this logic. Monday's selling was led by foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) with a net outflow at Rs 3,752 crore, that took the month's net withdrawal figure to about Rs 15,000 crore or $2 billion, BSE and CDSL data showed. Institutional sales people, who interact with foreign and domestic fund managers on a daily basis on behalf of brokers, said that a large part of the current selling is by hedge funds and ETFs while long-term investors like insurance companies and pension funds are not bearish on India, and hence not selling aggressively. The day's selling left investors poorer by nearly Rs 9 lakh crore with BSE's market capitalisation now at Rs 264 lakh crore. On a year-to-date basis, investors are poorer by Rs 5.3 lakh crore, official data showed. Despite the sharp sell-off, there are analysts who are assuring investors that the current sell-off is expected to ebb in the next two-three sessions. According to Harendra Kumar, MD, Elara Securities India, in December the sensex had seen a low at below 56k mark and we are yet to reach there. "Yet, investors are much nervous now mainly because there is a shift in investors' preference from growth stocks to value stocks," he said. What this means is that investors globally, including in India, are shifting from those companies with high price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio to reasonably lower P/E numbers. In India, stocks like Zomato and PayTM are growth stocks while companies like Reliance Industries, Maruti, ICICI Bank, etc, are value stocks. "There is a perceptible shift in investor preference" from growth to value stocks, he said. "The going for the high P/E stocks in the short run would be slightly challenging." Market players also said that compared to in the US where technology stocks have a huge weight in the indices and are being hammered, in India, similar tech-enabled companies have almost no weight in leading indices. Hence, investors should not panic and sell every profit-making stock, irrespective of the industry they belong to. On Monday evening, the leading indices in the US were hammered again with the Nasdaq composite index down over 3% in mid-session, while Dow Jones index was down 2% and S&P 500 2.6%.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/sensex-dives-1-5k-pts-on-selling-by-foreign-funds/articleshow/89102553.cms||---

The woman, who sustained multiple injuries, was rescued by commuters and taken to the hospital.The couple has been living separately for the past eight months and has a seven-year-old daughter from their marriage. The woman has filed for divorce and is involved in a custody battle for the child, who currently lives with the father. The matter is pending before the court in Gurgaon.Sunaina (26) works with the marketing department of a private company and lives in Gandhi Nagar. On Saturday, as she was returning home from work, her husband Ajit (30), an Ola driver by profession, intercepted her near the Umang Bharadwaj Chowk.

Meanwhile, on February 2, the department will organise an event to celebrate World Wetland Day at the Sultanpur National Park. During a webinar on wetland conservation organised by the state forest department on Monday, Jagdish Chandra, principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife), Haryana, said, “The state has been working towards notifying wetlands and conserving them. We have already got the Ramsar tag for two of our wetlands last year.”Currently, only two wetlands in Haryana have the Ramsar tag — Sultanpur National Park, Gurgaon, spread across 353 acres, and Bhindawas Wildlife Sanctuary, Jhajjar, covering more than 1,000 acres. Both wetlands are home to a wealth of bird species and attract many migratory birds every year, including the black-winged stilt, pond heron, pied kingfisher, purple heron, shoveller, white-breasted waterhen, white-breasted kingfisher and prinia.Chandra said, “Birds come to rest on these wetlands where specific trees help attract the birds. So, they were declared Ramsar sites, but they face threats, too. The Sultanpur National Park faces threats from large-scale construction activities around it. We are now working to protect water bodies and wetlands across the state.”Chandra stressed that India needs more Ramsar sites. “The economic value of wetlands is very high, and they are a source of groundwater recharge. They absorb carbon and thus, can act as climate change mitigators. But they are constantly under threat. Every district needs to come up with a management plan for these wetlands.” Manju Pandey, joint secretary, Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change (MoEFCC), who was part of the virtual meeting, pointed out that India has a target to have 75 Ramsar sites this year. “Till now, we have 47 Ramsar sites, and we are planning to touch the 75 mark this year,” he said. Ramsar sites are wetlands of international importance, which get legal protection and management guidelines, according to the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, 1971.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/come-up-with-wetland-conservation-plan-forest-dept-tells-dist-admins/articleshow/89102555.cms||Ipsita Pati

These illegal colonies, covering two to eight acres, have come up at Bhondsi, Farrukhnagar and Ghamroj in the last few months, police said.Around 11.5 acre in Bhondsi was developed into three illegal colonies by the offenders. The colonies were developed on plots measuring 1.5 acre to six acre. In Farrukhnagar, three illegal colonies on over 12.5 acre agricultural land were carved out by the offenders. The department has written to Farrukhnagar police to register FIR against 17 people. Similarly in Ghamroj, five offenders had carved out illegal colony on six acre. As per DTCP compliant, the land falls within Urban Area limit of Gurgaon. “The Section 3 of Act no. 8 of 1975, provides that the land owner shall get a licence before carving out a colony within Urban Area from the competent authority. Section 7 (i) of Act of 1975 prohibits sub division intention to sub division of land for carving out the colony. Section 7 (ii) prohibits construction in a colony for which license under section 3 of Act of 1975 has not been granted,” the complaint reads.District town planner (enforcement) RS Batth said, “The offenders have violated the norms by sub-dividing land for the purpose of colony. The offenders are deliberately continuing with the contravention of provision of Act of 1975 and rules.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/register-firs-against-31-violators-for-building-illegal-colonies-cops-told/articleshow/89102556.cms||Rao Jaswant Singh
---||Gurgaon||Portal to monitor dust pollution launched||Gurgaon: A government portal for the real-time monitoring of pollution levels at construction and demolition (C&D) sites was launched on Monday. The Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) portal is likely to bridge the gap between regulatory policies and their implementation by allowing timely interventions during those times of the year when the air quality deteriorates.Created on the directions of the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM), the portal features a live dashboard to reflect ambient air quality status at specific construction sites once the registrations, mandatory for any site that’s more than 500 square metres in area, are complete. The pollution sensors at the registered C&D sites will send data directly to the portal, according to the HSPCB.Using the portal, the board also plans to check the compliance with dust mitigation measures at the sites and reduce emissions at the source. On Dec 20, 2021, the CAQM had directed the state to commission a portal to monitor the spike in air pollution during winter, owing to a combination of adverse meteorological factors and local emission sources such as construction and demolition waste, dust, waste burning, vehicular emissions and stubble burning.“The portal is now functional,” S Narayana, HSPCB secretary, said, adding that all C&D sites of over 500sqm area must register on the portal. The HSPCB does not yet have data on how many C&D sites are over 500sqm, but the registrations will give an approximate idea.“Additionally, the construction sites should have reliable and economical PM2.5 and PM10 sensors, installed and linked to a platform with live dashboard accessibility for the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), government agencies and the administrative departments concerned,” Nipun, assistant environment engineer, HSPCB, said.He added that after the registrations, the HSPCB could check if the construction units are following all dust control measures, including covering construction material and debris and using water sprinklers and anti-smog guns to reduce dust emissions. “This will strengthen monitoring of dust control measures at the C&D sites. The regional officers will be going and assessing sites if the live data shows any issue, and penalties can be imposed, accordingly,” he said.The construction sites have been given a checklist for compliance with the dust mitigation measures in the NCR, including the use of anti-smog guns, water pills, water cannons, hoses, fire hydrants, sprinklers, etc.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/portal-to-monitor-dust-pollution-launched/articleshow/89102557.cms||Ipsita Pati

Sethia was suspended on August 10. The probe has so far led to 15 arrests, including henchmen of a gangster and two city-based doctors and recovery of Rs 6 crore of the stolen cash. According to its status report filed before the court, the STF believes the total cash stolen to be around Rs 30 crore. The STF took over the probe on October 30 after allegations of glaring lapses in the police investigation. It arrested two doctors, who allegedly told a gangster about the cash and helped plan and execute the crime. In their disclosure statements, the doctors claimed they paid Sethia a hefty bribe. Sethia was made accused in the case after the additional sessions judge in his order on December 2 observed, “From the… disclosure statement of accused Dr Suchinder Kumar Nawal, it is clear he has given illegal gratification to DCP Dheeraj Setia for hushing up the matter. He (Nawal) is also disclosed to have delivered huge amounts in the form of gold, dollars, etc… to DCP for said purpose. From perusal of the police file, I have not found any concrete step taken for taking the investigation to its logical conclusion on the basis of disclosures made by accused Dr Nawal. As such, the investigating agency has failed to perform its statutory duty with utmost care, especially when involvement of a senior police officer has come on record.”The judge had also issued directions to the STF to file a status report with details about action taken against Sethia. On December 16, the judge directed the STF to examine the role of all police officers who had dealt with the case, either in a supervisory capacity or as investigators. On December 18, the court issued an arrest warrant against Sethia. On January 17, the court again issued a strongly worded order and questioned the STF’s probe and its “complete silence with regard to the examination of roles of police officers who remained associated with the case or otherwise”. Sethia filed for anticipatory bail on January 21. “The officer has filed an application for changing the court. The district judge will decide on the application. The anticipatory bail application will be taken up after the order of the district judge,” said public prosecutor Jagbir Sehrawat.Gurgaon: Dheeraj Sethia, the IPS officer who was suspended during the investigation into a massive cash heist last August from two flats at a condominium in Sector 84 for allegedly taking a bribe from the accused, has filed an application before the district and sessions judge, seeking a transfer of his case from additional sessions judge Jasbir Singh’s court.Sethia was named as an accused in the case on December 8 by the special task force (STF), which took over the probe from the police and added sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act and section 411 (dishonestly receiving stolen property) of the IPC to the FIR of theft that was registered at Kherki Daula police station in August.

---||Gurgaon||Parks not maintained? Municipal Corporation of Gurgaon says it’ll withhold upkeep fee||GURGAON: The Municipal Corporation of Gurgaon (MCG) has decided to withhold the maintenance costs for parks, which are not in good condition due to lack of upkeep work by RWAs or ward committees. At a recent MCG meeting, it was decided that the executive engineers of the horticulture wing will direct the RWAs or ward committees concerned to properly maintain the parks, failing which the civic body won’t release the maintenance fees. “I have directed the staff to keep a watch on the parks and conduct a survey. The parks, which are not in good condition, will no longer receive maintenance. Since the park maintenance rates have also been increased from Rs 3 to Rs 4 per square metre, we expect the quality of upkeep to improve. The maintenance payments will be released based on the condition of parks,” said Subhash Yadav, nodal officer of the MCG’s environment and sustainability wing. There are 938 parks in the MCG limits; 320 are managed by RWAs and 551 by ward committees. According to the MCG, the parks will get categorised as A, B, C and D. While category A parks will be considered the best-maintained, categories B and C will be the parks that need renovation. The category D parks will need a complete overhaul, said officials, adding that they have already identified 18 such parks, which will undergo renovation. “We are preparing the estimates for the renovation of the category D parks so that work on them starts soon,” said an MCG official. The RWAs, meanwhile, said that it was a good idea, but they are apprehensive that the MCG will favour the ward committees over the RWAs. “If any agency, whether an RWA or ward committee, is not doing their job, they are wasting taxpayers’ money. It is a good decision, but the problem is that the MCG officials deal with the ward councillors directly. The councillors give satisfactory certificates to the MCG for the development works in their wards. However, RWAs have no such power, so the chances of officials favouring ward committees are higher,” said Suraj Lalit Bhola, general secretary, Sector 9A RWA. Ravinder Yadav, councillor, ward number 3, said that RWAs maintain most parks in his ward, but if the councillors and RWAs maintain the parks jointly, both will be fair and accountable. “The RWAs and the ward committees, which have destroyed our parks, should not be given upkeep work by the MCG. But there are some RWAs in my ward which contribute funds to maintain the parks. So, those who want to do their job will do it even in the absence of funds; others won’t even if paid for it,” said Yadav.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/parks-not-maintained-mcg-says-itll-withhold-upkeep-fee/articleshow/89102559.cms||Vishakha Chaman

Officials said they are currently seeking public feedback. “This will be an entirely new master dividing road that will be constructed to provide residents and commuters with an alternative and easy travel between the two sectors. The project has been planned keeping in mind the needs and requests of residents,” said a senior GMDA official. In its current form, the project includes the construction of the master road along with a roadside drain. It also involves the creation of a concrete kerb and installation of road safety and devices such as road studs and traffic signboards. “At present, we have put up details of the proposal on the GMDA website for public consultation. Once feedback is obtained and incorporated where possible, we will float tenders and allot work,” said the official. He added that the project, once started, is expected to take about eight months to complete. Located close to the Delhi-Gurgaon border on one end and the Dwarka Expressway on the other, both sectors 109 and 112 see a high level of vehicular footfall as they house churches, temples and gurdwaras, as well as commercial spaces and residential societies. Residents have welcomed the GMDA’s plan. “A new road will definitely help residents. My only concern is how long it will take for this work to actually be completed because agencies never seem to be able to abide by their timelines,” said Dhan Singh, a resident of Bajghera village.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/new-master-road-for-sectors-109-112-soon-to-cut-travel-time-gmda/articleshow/89102560.cms||Sakshi Dayal
---||Gurgaon||Gurgaon: Kanwar Pal says ‘no’ to reopening, private schools to continue protests||GURGAON: Though some private schools have launched a statewide ‘Shiksha Bachao, School Kholo’ (Save Education, Reopen Schools) campaign, the Haryana education minister has ruled out any such possibility until the Covid situation stabilises. “No decision over the reopening of schools. Though we were planning to open schools at 33% capacity on different days, no decision has been taken yet. As the Covid cases decline, we can think over it (reopening of schools),” education minister Kanwar Pal said in a statement on Monday. The private schools, however, made it clear that they would continue with their protest. And as part of their campaign, the school owners met the respective deputy commissioners in districts like Gurgaon, Bhiwani, Hisar, Panchkula and Jind and handed over to them a memorandum addressed to the CM. Private Schools Welfare Association president Ram Awtar said, “We have been forced to come out on the streets and protest for school reopening. The situation was different during the first and the second waves. When it has been proven that this variant is not lethal, we don’t see any logic behind keeping schools shut.” In fact, private school associations said the academic institutions would be recalling students to the campuses regardless of the government’s orders, citing their inability to continue with online classes because of tech and budgetary constraints and the overall deterioration in the quality of learning. “The government is just making populist statements to show that they are serious. On the ground, schools and parents are against the order and many are already running schools. Many more are going to open by the end of this month,” said Yashpal Yadav, state president of Haryana Shikshan Sansthan Sangathan. Parents, too, condemned the prolonged closure of the schools and demanded the government reopen the academic institutions adhering to all Covid-safety protocols norms for the safety of the kids. Parents said that in the coming days they too will take to the streets to lend support for the school reopening demand. Anju Kapoor, a parent of two kids, said, “It appears that the government has taken education very lightly. Kids are now showing visible signs of deep learning gaps. They are missing out on behavioural learning and social skills, and losing the discipline they had when they went to school. We are worried about their future.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/minister-says-no-to-reopening-pvt-schools-to-continue-protests/articleshow/89102561.cms||Siddharth Tiwari

Most of them filed nominations as either Independents or from smaller parties. Of the 52 candidates in GB Nagar, 23 had filed their nominations from Noida constituency, 16 from Dadri and 13 from Jewar. The maximum number of 10 nominations were cancelled from the Noida seat, with seven candidates representing Sarv Samaj Party, Shiv Sena, Bharatiya Mahasangh Party, Public Political Party, Bharatiya Insan Party, Al-Hind Party and Bharatiya Jan Jagriti Party, respectively. Three filed nominations as independents. In Ghaziabad, six nominations were cancelled from Muradnagar, followed by Sahibabad (5) and Ghaziabad (4). Loni and Modianagar seats saw the cancellation of two and one nominations, respectively. Officials said the nominations were cancelled due to discrepancies in the documents filed by them.

Natthu Singh Chaudhary (71), a retired SBI manager who had filed his nomination papers from Muradnagar, said, “I contested the UP assembly polls in 2017 and Lok Sabha elections in 2019. My agenda was to ask people to move over caste and dynasty and vote for those who can raise their issues. Criminals and uneducated people had occupied space in major political parties.” His nomination was cancelled as he had left several columns blank. “After I was reminded about it, I gave separate pages completing those columns. I did not know that I was required to fill the entire nomination form afresh,” he added. Meanwhile, a day earlier, BJP rebel and Loni Nagar Palika Parishad chairman Ranjeeta Dhama threatened to set herself on fire, along with her daughters, in front of UP CM’s residence if her nomination was rejected.

---||Noida||Noida: D-day nearing, nervousness and relief at Emerald Court||NOIDA: It’ll be the culmination of a battle that began exactly 10 years ago when the twin towers on the Emerald Court compound – Apex and Ceyane – are brought down, likely in May. On the Supertech Emerald Court compound is palpable relief about finally seeing towers that dwarfed the rest of the complex go. But there’s nervousness too about the demolition exercise, which is also being felt on the other side of the Emerald Court boundary wall at ATS Greens Village. The twin towers, which the Supreme Court held illegal and ordered the demolition of on August 31 last year, will be brought down by Mumbai-based Edifice Engineering. The countdown to the demolitions began on Sunday with Edifice and Supertech signing the contract, work order and agreement for the exercise. Nearly 2,200 people live in Emerald Court. While two towers — Aster 2 and 3 — of the housing complex are located barely nine metres from the twin towers and are likely to be most affected by the vibrations, people living in other towers of Emerald Court have also been advised to leave the society for at least five to six hours when the demolitions happen, residents said. At ATS Greens Village, where 700 of the total 736 flats are occupied, residents of at least four towers — 6, 6A, 7 and 8 —located about 40-50 metres from the twin towers, are closest to the demolition site. On Monday, the president of the society’s RWA Bharat Bhusan said, “I have already written to the Noida Authority two to three times urging them to include residents of nearby housing societies in any decision related to the demolition of the twin towers. All the residents are anxious and scared about the fallout of this demolition exercise. So far, the Authority has not responded to our queries or shared any plan of action.” Bhusan, who lives in tower 6, said he has also written to the Noida Authority CEO seeking insurance cover for damages, if any, to their housing society during the exercise. “There will be vibrations when the debris falls on the ground. So, we need to prepare ourselves. How are we supposed to do it if the Authority does not share any plans with us?” he asked. UBS Teotia (80), the president of the Emerald Court RWA, which initiated the legal battle against the twin towers in 2012, said their relentless pursuit of justice would finally bearing fruit. “For the last 12 years, we had a very bad experience and perhaps it will continue for another 6-8 months after the demolition exercise. Of course, residents are worried about how the entire exercise will be undertaken, whether it will be safe and what could be the after-effects. But we have been informed that Edifice Engineering, which will carry out the demolition exercise, has global exposure and experience,” he said. The society’s RWA vice-president, 74-year-old SK Sharma, agreed that there were concerns. “People are apprehensive about their safety, but we have been assured that there will be no damage to the adjacent structures and human life,” he said. Vinod Chandra Srivastav, the RWA secretary added, “The Aster 2 and 3 buildings (the ones closest to the twin towers) were not getting air and not getting sun. The residents had a very bad life for several years. We want that the agency that has been finalised should do it very carefully so that the safety of the people is not compromised and the safety of the other structures is taken care of so that people can live happily once this is over.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/d-day-nearing-nervousness-and-relief-at-emerald-court/articleshow/89102573.cms||---

All the goods that were stolen have been recovered. The accused have been identified as Bheem and Vishal, both residents of Greater Noida, and police say that the two were interested in leading a ‘luxurious lifestyle’ and it is for that reason that they took to crime. “On Thursday, we received a complaint where the complainant, Ajay Kumar, a resident of MU1 in Greater Noida, stated that some miscreants had broken into his house when he was away and had stolen his valuables,” a senior officer at Dadri police station, said. The thieves had managed to steal a laptop, an iPad, three mobile phones, a hard disk, two watches and the keys of the Bullet motorcycle of the complainant. Following the complaint a case under section 380 (theft in dwelling, house, etc.) and 454 (lurking house-trespass or house-breaking in order to commit offence punishable with imprisonment) of the IPC was registered against unknown people. “We had formed teams to investigate the case. CCTV footage of the area was scanned. On Monday morning we received a tip-off about the movement of the two suspects near Ajaibpur railway crossing,” the officer said. Teams were formed and the two accused were nabbed, police said. “We have managed to recover all the stolen goods from their possession. During interrogation, the accused revealed that they wanted to make some quick money and live a luxurious lifestyle, following which they started getting involved in such acts,” the officer added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/two-held-for-robbery-at-gr-noida-house/articleshow/89102575.cms||Advitya Bahl

The changes, notified in light of a fresh surge in Covid cases, will kick in soon after the President delivers a joint address to both Houses on January 31. On February 1, Lok Sabha will meet at 11 am for the presentation of the Union Budget. From February 2 to 11, the first half of the Budget session, the Lower House will sit from 4pm to 9pm, while Rajya Sabha will operate during the morning hours, likely from 9am to 2pm. LS and RS chambers and galleries will be used for seating members with physical distancing norms in place, a Lok Sabha bulletin issued on Monday said. So far, timings have only been notified for the first half of the Budget session. Between the month-long adjournment, standing committees will examine demands for grant raised by various ministries and departments. Both Houses will reconvene on March 14 and the Budget session is expected to conclude on April 8. The shift sitting for both Houses was introduced in the monsoon session of Parliament in 2020, with RS meeting in the first half of the day and LS in the second half.

The Houses reverted to their original timings from the second part of budget session in 2021.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lok-sabha-rajya-sabha-to-operate-in-separate-shifts-during-budget-session/articleshow/89102552.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Pandemic effect: General medicine gets an edge in Karnataka colleges||BENGALURU: Fees of a few PG medical courses in Karnataka colleges under ‘NRI and others' quotas have been increased for the coming academic year, with college-wise revisions pegged between 5% and 50%. General medicine, which costs around Rs 90 lakh to Rs 1.2 crore in some top-bracket colleges, is vying with radiology as the most-sought-after specialization this time round, mainly due to the raging pandemic that has headlined its importance among medical students. Fees for general medicine and radiology are nearly the same — at Rs 1.2 crore a year — under NRI quota in at least one private college in Bengaluru. Interestingly, the general medicine course in the government-owned Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute costs Rs 1.1 lakh a year, or a tenth of the NRI-quota fee. "Earlier, general medicine was not as well paid as that of a radiologist. With the pandemic, the importance of an intensivist, who is either specialised in general medicine or anaesthesia with additional training has become extremely important. The demand for both courses has gone up," said an official of a deemed university. Karnataka has 3,084 post-graduate medical seats for 2021, the seat matrix for which was announced on the Karnataka Examinations Authority website on Monday. As many as 926 seats are in the government quota, 39 in the government PWD quota, 1,186 in private quota, 396 for in-service candidates and 537 for NRIs. Interestingly, there has been a steep hike in fees for general medicine in NRI/others quota as mentioned on the KEA website. In Shivashankarappa Institute of Medical Sciences, Davanagere, the fee has seen nearly a 50% rise, up from Rs 60.1 lakh in 2020 to Rs 90.1 lakh in 2021. In MS Ramaiah, the fee this year is Rs 85.1 lakh as against Rs 70.1 lakh last year. Jaya Jagadguru Murugharajendra Medical College, Davanagere, is charging Rs 90.1 lakh as against Rs 80.1 lakh last year. In Vydehi Institute of Medical Science and Research Centre, Bengaluru, the fees is Rs 75.1 lakh, a hike of Rs 5 lakh from last year. At Sapthagiri Institute of Medical Sciences, students have to pay Rs 1.2 crore for a general medicine seat in the NRI quota, same as last year, and Rs 1.3 crore for a PG seat in radiology. The fees under the government quota is Rs 7.1 lakh and private quota Rs 11.5 lakh. The NRI quota fees for pediatrics, general medicine, ophthalmology and gynaecology in this college is quoted at Rs 1.2 crore on the KEA website. In some colleges like in Kempegowda Institute of Medical Sciences, the fees for MD dermatology is more than that of MD radio diagnosis under NRI quota. While the former was Rs 90.1 lakh the latter is Rs 85.1 lakh. "With NEET counselling coming in even for NRI seats, the fees has to be paid in white. Not many can afford to be transparent and pay such huge amounts through bank transaction," said a medical professional.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/pandemic-effect-gen-medicine-gets-an-edge/articleshow/89102627.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas
---||Mumbai||Covid-19: Elderly make up 84% of Mumbai’s 3rd wave deaths||MUMBAI: Senior citizens account for 84% of Mumbai’s Covid-19 deaths in January so far, making up a much higher proportion of fatalities than during the second wave. But the Omicron-driven third wave has claimed fewer lives (159), way lower than the second wave peak. As per BMC data, of the 159 deaths, 134 were of people above 60 years, 20 (13%) were between 40 and 60, and five (about 3%) were below 40. The numbers show that up to 86% had one or more underlying health conditions; many were also unvaccinated or partially vaccinated. In comparison, during the second wave in April-May last year, the proportion of senior citizens succumbing to Covid had dropped to 65% and 60% respectively. 'Virulence seen in second wave is now missing'Deaths of people between 40-60 years had increased to 30% in April and 32.5% in May. Deaths had increased even in age groups under 40, where the case fatality rate touched 5% and 7% in the two months. "The virulence seen in the second wave was definitely missing in the third wave, and that is reflected in the death figures," said Dr Rajas Walinjkar, who heads the Covid-19 unit at SevenHills Hospital. In the second wave, believed to be driven by the Delta strain, younger people died despite being treated with the right medicines. "None of the Covid-19 patients went into a cytokine storm this time that was commonly seen in the second wave," Dr Walinjkar added. The third wave started around December 21 and peaked on January 7 with 20,971 cases. Given the fact that there is a lag of a few weeks between cases and deaths, the city started daily recording deaths in double digits since January 11. The curve was much steeper during the second wave last year. After reporting 391 deaths in March, deaths jumped to 2,727 in April and 1,858 in May. Doctors argue that if the share of incidental Covid is taken away from Covid deaths, the numbers could be even lower in the third wave. Dr Arpita Dwivedy, head of critical care at Hiranandani hospital, said that they have recorded six deaths, but all were among elderly patients with underlying conditions. Among them was an 84-year-old woman who came with myocardial infarction and incidentally tested positive for Covid. Another deceased had very high bilirubin levels and malignancy, but she too tested positive for Covid-19. "If you ask me how many people died of pure Covid complications in my ICU, I would say none in this wave," said Dr Dwivedy. However, it doesn't mean there are no serious Covid patients with bad lungs in the ICU. "About 25% of ICU patients are serious with pure Covid complications and high HRCT scores of 20/25. The good news is they are recovering even though they are taking longer," Dr Dwivedy said, adding that whether such cases are Delta or Omicron can't be said with certainty. Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state government task force on Covid-19, also said that senior citizens need to remain watchful even if Covid is triggering mild symptoms. "Those who are unvaccinated, partially vaccinated or severely immunocompromised should continue to remain extremely cautious," Dr Joshi added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/elderly-make-up-84-of-citys-3rd-wave-deaths/articleshow/89102595.cms||Sumitra Debroy

However, some buying at lower levels in the closing hour helped the index to close at 57,492, down 1,546 points on the day. A rumour about a hike in long term capital gains tax rate in the Budget, which was later denied by the government, also added to investors’ nervousness, market players said.In the last five sessions the sensex has lost nearly 4,000 points, from its recent closing high at 61,309 on January 17. One of the main reasons for this slide is the selling by select foreign funds, market players said. If interest rates in the world’s leading economies go up to rein in inflation, that would make getting money expensive and hence these fund managers are taking some money off risky emerging markets, including India, analysts said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/sensex-dives-1-5k-pts-on-selling-by-foreign-funds-ltcg-rumour/articleshow/89102591.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Central Mumbai flat sales rose 93% last year over 2019: Study||MUMBAI: Central Mumbai led the revival in property sales in 2021, Thane had the highest stamp duty collection in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) , while the western suburbs brought in the highest sales value of Rs 49,000 crore, found an industry study released on Monday. Flat registrations in central Mumbai (Parel, Dadar, Prabhadevi, Wadala, Matunga) jumped 93% from 2019 and 71% from 2020. There were 7,337 registrations at an average Rs 35,000 a square foot in the belt. Of these, the luxury segment had a 77% share in sales, said the report ‘MMR Housing Uptick Aided By Support’ conducted jointly by CREDAI-MCHI, Colliers and CRE Matrix. Stamp duty slash helped sales, but no. of unsold flats in MMR still highThane (Kalwa, Majiwada, Wagle Estate, Kolshet, Kasarvadavli) accounted for the highest number of registrations with a 42% share in MMR, and the highest stamp duty collection. There were 1,02,054 property registrations at an average price of Rs 10,300 a sq ft. The clear preference here was for flats priced below Rs 1 crore, said the report. The western suburbs (Andheri, Goregaon, Malad, Kandivli, Borivli, Dahisar) recorded 37,985 property registrations at Rs 21,300 a sq ft. The sales value of about Rs 49,000 crore accounted for one-fourth of the total sales revenue in MMR. "Incentives introduced by the Maharashtra government triggered activity in MMR's residential market and helped the market spring back from the dampened demand environment due to Covid-19," said the report. "There was a direct benefit seen on affordable and mid-segment demand, led by the incentives. However, there is still room for some continued support for homebuyers in an uncertain economic environment.'' The slashing of stamp duty had a positive impact on homebuyers as it directly reduced the financial outgo while purchasing a house, it added. For instance, a homebuyer who bought a property with an agreement value of Rs 70 lakh, paid stamp duty of Rs 1.4 lakh between September 1, 2020, and December 31, 2020, and Rs 2.1 lakh between January 1, 2021, and March 31, 2021, as against Rs 3.5 lakh without a rate cut at 5%. The market conditions have improved, but MMR continues to see substantial unsold inventory. For perspective, the unsold inventory at the end of December 2021 was just 1% lower from that of 2020. "Despite a spurt in sales (measured through property registrations) led by stamp duty cuts and other concessions, unsold inventory still stands higher than pre-Covid levels. This underscores the importance of continuous short-term relief measures that can keep market sentiments positive," said the report. Overall project launches in Mumbai increased 3% from 2020, but continue to be about 4% lower than pre-Covid levels.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/central-mumbai-flat-sales-rose-93-last-year-over-2019-study/articleshow/89102580.cms||---

The victim’s card had been fraudulently used to buy an expensive phone and some other items, but the Matunga police managed to coordinate with the e-commerce company, and asked them stop the delivery and refund the money. The applicant was organising a lunch programme for his friends and wanted to book tables in a central Mumbai restaurant. He looked up the restaurant online and found a contact number listed. Unaware that it was a fraudster’s number, the complainant called him up and requested to book tables. The conman asked for an advance. He asked for the victim’s credit card details, including CVV number, etc, and then asked him to share the OTP sent on his mobile phone. When the victim got a message about a transaction for Rs 1.1 lakh, he realised he had been duped and approached the police. Since he contacted the police within a couple of hours of the crime, the cops were able to take quick action as well. PSI Rajabhau Garad and team coordinated with the nodal officer of the payment gateway and then contacted the e-commerce platform. “The money was refunded to the applicant,” said a police source. The buyer was from Jharkhand, said police.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/city-cops-nip-cyber-fraud-in-the-bud-1l-refunded/articleshow/89102640.cms||Mateen Hafeez

A complaint was filed before the Court of Judicial Magistrate First Class (JMFC), Mundawar for offences under Indian Penal Code for obscenity and criminal conspiracy, section 67 of Information Technology Act 2000 (transmission of obscene material) along with section 4 and 6 of Indecent representation of women (prohibition) Act. The case was transferred to Mumbai in 2017 on apex court orders. Shetty had attended an AIDS awareness event in 2007 in Rajasthan, said her lawyer Madhukar Dalvi arguing her 2017 discharge plea and said the complaint against her is “baseless and frivolous.’’ The magistrate, Ketaki Chavan, in the order made ready on January 24, said, “after giving the prosecution and accused an opportunity of being heard, I am satisfied that charge against present accused ie Shilpa Shetty is groundless.’’  The accusation against Shetty was that the complainant read an article and saw photographs of their public display of affection. It also led to a nationwide protest where Shetty and Gere’s effigies were burnt on the streets.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/2007-case-shilpa-shetty-discharged/articleshow/89102641.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Mumbai||Mumbai's daily Covid cases fall to 1,857 on weekend effect, ebbing wave||MUMBAI: Continuing with its declining graph, Mumbai’s daily Covid cases on Monday dipped to 1,857 — almost a tenth of the caseload a fortnight ago and the lowest so far this year. The state also reported a 30% drop in cases in the last 24 hours while adding 28,286 cases on Monday. The state reported a drop in Covid deaths as well for the fourth day in a row, but it was still higher than the average daily fatalities recorded for the last few months. The state registered 36 deaths, of which 11 were from Mumbai. Officials attributed much of the drop in numbers to low testing during the weekend. Only 34,301 tests were done in the city, when the usual figure has been almost double that during the Omicron wave. “The low tally is due to the Sunday effect,” said BMC additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. “But the third wave is on the decline and we have other parameters pointing to that as well,” he added. Daily hospitalisations have dropped, the percentage of occupied beds has dipped to 10.2% as against 15%-plus a week ago and the doubling rate of the infection has more than doubled in the same time to 144 days. Kakani said the only concern right now is the daily toll, which is in double digits (after remaining in a single digit for five months) but this is in keeping with the trend of deaths peaking about a fortnight after the peak in cases. “Every life is important, but the death rate during the third wave has been 0.07% unlike the earlier two waves,” said Kakani. Kakani said the city’s caseload could drop below 1,000 over the week. The tally across the Mumbai Metropolitan Region too dropped by half, with 4,773 cases registered on Monday. State government officials said cases in Mumbai were clearly declining and the surge is now being reported from other districts, especially the Pune region. “We are closely monitoring the tests carried out in these districts. With positivity rate on the rise, districts have been asked to ramp up testing,” said an official. According to the health department’s daily Covid bulletin, the Pune region reported 9,165 cases, the highest in the state. Nashik region stood third with 3,401 cases. Like Mumbai, hospitalisation is not on the rise in other districts. Nearly 90% beds are vacant in the state. “Once cases start spreading to smaller districts, we could see a higher rate of hospitalisation. Though the caseload may be smaller than Mumbai, it could be enough to overwhelm the health infrastructure in those areas,” said an official. He said it is clear from the Mumbai example that the Omicron wave is sharper but shorter, and it is expected that by mid-February, cases in the state will start to report a decline. “Once cases in cities like Pune, Nashik and Nagpur, which are seeing a surge at the moment, start to decline, there will be an overall dip in the state’s tally,” said the official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/city-cases-fall-to-1857-on-weekend-effect-ebbing-wave/articleshow/89102642.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Mumbai||Covid-19: Omicron accounts for 89% cases in Mumbai, shows genome sequencing||Mumbai: The latest round of genome sequencing has found that Omicron is the dominant strain in the city. In the eighth round of sequencing, a total of 373 samples were sequenced at the laboratory in Kasturba Hospital. Of these, 280 samples belonged to Mumbai residents. BMC said that 89% of the city’s samples were infected with Omicron, 8% with Delta derivatives and 3% with Delta variants and rest with other subtypes. In the seventh round of sequencing, the Omicron variant was found in 55% cases, while in the round prior to that, 62% of cases in Mumbai were found to be Delta derivatives.

School heads said attendance on Monday was not as satisfactory as in December. Veena Donwalkar, principal, Chhatrapati Shivaji School, Dharavi, said the attendance in classes 1 to 4 was poor.Secondary and higher secondary students put on their woollens and got to school. “Over 175 students (44%) made it to school this morning despite the cold,” said Abhishek Kulkarni, teacher at Laxmibai School in Mulund. At Bright High School in Bhandup, students in uniform made it on time for their lectures.Some school heads said they will continue online as parents are not confident. “We will open on February 1 if parents’ response is good,” said an Andheri school principal.St Xavier’s College has got consent from 66% parents of Class 11 arts students. “We will start offline from January 27 when students with consent can be in class,” said vice-principal Hasnain Naqvi.Meanwhile, pre-schools began welcoming students after 10am. Podar Jumbo Kids centres saw 55-62% attendance. Centre heads spoke about students’ excitement. “Parents are a little anxious about sending children to offline schools but in the coming weeks we hope to get more children,” said director Dr Swati Vats. Philomena Tella, centre head, EuroKids International, Mulund, said the response from parents has been overwhelming. School education minister Varsha Gaikwad has requested parents to send kids to schools.Schools had begun reopening in October 2021 after the March 2020 lockdown. On January 3 this year, the government was forced to shut them due to rising Omicron cases. Classes 10 and 12 were allowed in the hybrid mode in line with their offline board exams in March-April. Degree colleges and universities in the state are awaiting chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s nod to open. They were initially ordered shut till February 15.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/secondary-pre-primary-buzz-on-a-day-few-city-schools-open/articleshow/89102644.cms||Sandhya Nair

The HC bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice M S Karnik heard Sumedha Rao, counsel for the petitioner – an NGO called Prameya Welfare Foundation, who said applicants whom the petitioner is representing, are from poorer section and finding it difficult to upload the annexures. The web portal is for administrative convenience, said the HC, adding “getting compensation is their right’’ and families of Covid-19 victims cannot be deprived of ex gratia only because they filed applications physically. Rao said that the physical applications were filed before the web portal was opened. The Supreme Court has in its order October said that compensation must be given even where application is not made by identifying the claimants, she submitted. State government pleader Purnima Kantharia said the web portal has streamlined the process with amounts reaching beneficiaries directly and said the NGO could help the applicants submit the forms online too. The HC observed that the SC order was that the administration must reach families who had lost a member to Covid. Observing that the state keep the SC order in mind, THE HC asked, “why should you be so technical?’’||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/hc-hears-plea-on-50000-ex-gratia-to-covid-victims/articleshow/89102645.cms||Swati Deshpande

The saffron parties were then in an alliance. “After Babri, there was a Shiv Sena wave in North India. Had we contested polls there at that time, there would have been our (Sena) PM. But we left it for BJP,” he said. Raut said it was Sena which had helped BJP gain a foothold in Maharashtra. “We took BJP from bottom to top in Maharashtra. BJP only uses Hindutva for power,” he said. Raut said Sena would now fight polls in all states. “CM Uddhav Thackeray has given a clear message. We want to expand across the country, and are ready to face the challenge of fighting for it,” said Raut. He said the party was contesting in Goa and UP. “We have won the Lok Sabha seat in Dadra-Nagar Haveli and started work in south Gujarat,” he said.

Now, Godse’s supporters have selected the same date to release the film. It must be banned. It should be ensured that it is not released in any cinema house nor on the OTT platform,” Patole said in a letter to the CM. Patole pointed out that the world observes January 30 as non-violence day and that Gandhi promoted the concept of non-violence and truth throughout life. “Unfortunately anti-Gandhi people are releasing the film on his death anniversary; Congress will not allow it. We are against glorification of such events. I was planning to personally call on the CM, but due to his ill-health, I sent a letter,” he said. —Prafulla Marpakwar||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/cm-urged-to-ban-release-of-godse-film/articleshow/89102647.cms||---

The court said the state should present the data it has to the MSBCC which should then examine its correctness and make a recommendation to the state. The next SC hearing is on February 8.“We received a lot of data from the state. The commission will meet on January 28, and review the data. We will then make an interim report for the court,” said a member of the panel.The data shared include NSSO material, data on OBC representation in polls with the district collectors, data from the education department, the social justice department and admissions data on OBCs, sources said. However, what will be key is data on the political representation of OBCs, not their socio-economic status or their numbers.Meanwhile, OBC affairs minister Vijay Wadettiwar lashed out at being excluded from information. “While food and civil supplies minister Chhagan Bhujbal briefs the media, I am not even given information on which lawyer is appearing on this issue in court.

Meanwhile, during this course of over a decade, several fire disasters have taken place, including the fatal Kamla Mills tragedy.The matter is of enormous public interest and has profound implications on the Right to Life, stated the PIL.Under Section 46 of the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966, any draft notification has got a statutory force — the regulations need to be implemented at once, the PIL pointed out.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/fire-safety-draft-rules-hc-to-hear-petition-on-feb-7/articleshow/89102649.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Fire brigade got over 3,000 blaze calls in 2021, 34% less than in pre-pandemic 2019||MUMBAI: There was a 34% drop in calls for fire incidents in Mumbai between 2019 and 2021, when restrictions were in place to check the spread of coronavirus. The Mumbai Fire Brigade received 3,515 calls in 2021, 4,512 calls in 2020 and 5,324 in 2019, according to BMC data. In the past five years, firemen have attended to a total 22,764 fire-related calls. Senior fire officials told TOI that the dip could have been due to the pandemic-induced lockdown imposed early in 2020 which slowed down businesses and even forcing some to shut shop. “As most people were working from home, fire calls from commercial establishments and office spaces automatically dipped. Usually, the electrical load in office units with air-conditioning units and computer systems working all day is high and there is a chance of short-circuit,” said a fire official. Another official said one of the reasons for the drop is the fire brigade’s awareness campaigns to educate citizens on the importance of fire safety. As part of the drive, citizens are trained to identify different kinds of fires, how to operate an extinguisher, and exits to use in case of a fire . Fire officials further said that they have been constantly working upon improving their response time. Following the blaze at the 60-storey One Avighna Park at Currey Road in November last year, the BMC had informed the civic standing committee that in a congested city like Mumbai the response time for blazes especially during peak hours touches 20 minutes even while the Centre mandates it to be around 6.5 minutes. RTI activist Santosh Daundkar said that fire incidents in the city can be curbed if regular inspections of buildings are undertaken by officials. “In case of any deficiencies, they would be able to point out the same which the structure could then rectify,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/fire-brigade-got-over-3k-blaze-calls-in-21-34-less-than-in-pre-pandemic-19/articleshow/89102650.cms||Richa Pinto

Indrani claimed that Korke reportedly saw the ‘murder victim’ last year in Srinagar and pleaded that the cop’s statement be recorded. Indrani had filed a handwritten application dated December 28, 2021. Her lawyer Sana Raees Khan on Monday submitting it before the special CBI court judge sought a reply from Central Bureau of Investigation. The special Judge granted the agency time till February 4 to file its reply. Indrani, alleged by CBI to be the biological mother of Sheena Bora who she allegedly murdered in April 2012, said, “On November 25, 2021, around 7 am, I was approached by a lady who said she needed to discuss with about something important.’’ Her plea said the woman claimed that “in June end or July 2021, she had met and spoken with my daughter Sheena Bora’’ “standing near Dal Lake’’ when she went on a vacation to Srinagar. Her application says Korke claims Sheena asked if she had come to put her “behind bars’’ and that she tried to reason with her daughter saying she must come forward as her “parents are incarcerated for her murder’’ and claimed “Sheena replied to her ‘I have started my new life’`. Indrani’s application says that the woman cop told her that a man who looked like a foreigner arrived on a motorcycle and Sheena hurriedly left with him. In view of the “new revelation’’ the prosecution agency must say whether it took steps to record the statement of Korke as she is willing to give her statement, said her application. Indrani was not physically present in court on Monday. Her application said she had on hearing the details told the woman co-inmate that she would inform the CBI of their conversation and also subsequently the special trial court.

According to the police, the complainant runs Mahavir Jewellers at SBS Road at Colaba. On January 21, Qureshi visited the shop and said he urgently needed money for his pregnant wife’s hospitalisation. The ornaments appeared to be genuine gold so the jeweller gave Qureshi Rs 1.4 lakh. Two days later, the complainant showed the gold ornaments to their association, which declared them fake, merely polished with gold. Qureshi’s mobile phone was switched off.

He was stopped and told to file the statement as an affidavit. After Singh’s March 2021 ‘letter bomb’ when he had alleged that Deshmukh had asked cops to extort Rs 100 crore a month from pubs and restaurants, this seems like a retaliatory salvo. Sources said Deshmukh will file the affidavit in a couple of days. On Monday, as the commission was about to wind up proceedings, Deshmukh, who was standing in the witness box, said: “I want to tell Param Satya Jayate to the commission.” He began reading from pages in his hands, but was stopped by Justice Chandiwal, who said Deshmukh can’t orally disclose the information, if he wants to make a statement, it should be as an affidavit. Significantly, Singh has submitted an affidavit before the commission, saying he would not like to cross-examine anyone or lead evidence, while Vaze has said neither Deshmukh nor any of his staff members asked him to mobilise funds. Deshmukh was asked on Monday how the controversial Vaze was appointed to lead the prestigious CIU (crime investigation unit) and who had drafted the questionnaire for JCP Milind Bharambe, who conducted a probe against Vaze after the allegations. He replied it was the task of the Mumbai CP’s office, and then added: “Apparently, it was the exercise of the home department.” Asked what action was taken on the report submitted by the Mumbai police, Deshmukh said since the home department received the report on March 30, he got only five days to act on the report. He resigned after that. Deshmukh admitted that the appointment of DGP Hemant Nagrale as Mumbai police commissioner was in a way a demotion, but both the posts — Mumbai CP and DGP — are equivalent. Asked if Nagrale was posted as CP to fix Vaze, Deshmukh said he was not responsible for the posting, it was the government’s prerogative.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/deshmukh-lines-up-affidavit-bomb-for-param-bir/articleshow/89102659.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

The forecast for Tuesday is that the minimum will dip to 14 degrees. The minimum recorded by the Met’s Santacruz observatory was 15 degrees Celsius while it had been at 21 degrees on Sunday. The minimum recorded at the Colaba observatory on Monday was 16.2 degrees Celsuis. The day temperatures recorded also remained on the lower side as Colaba and Santacruz observatories recorded maximum temperatures of 24.6 degrees and 24.8 degrees respectively. These cool weather conditions come a day after the city witnessed occasional dust-raising winds which had led to a reduction in visibility in the city. Monday’s maximum temperature of 24 degrees was unusual for the month of January. In at least last one decade the lowest January day temperature has been 25.3 degrees recorded on January 17,2020. On Sunday, the Santacruz observatory set a new record with the maximum xof 23.8 — the lowest day temperature recorded in a decade. “Generally, north-easterly winds prevail in the lower level over the region,” IMD said, explaining the reason for dip in temperatures. According to IMD’s 24-hour forecast for the city, minimum and maximum temperatures are expected to stay around 25 degrees and 14 degrees respectively. The weatherman has forecast that while Tuesday will continue to see cool weather conditions, a gradual increase can be expected from the weekend. The lowest minimum for the city this season has been of 13.2 on January 10.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/min-temp-sees-a-sharp-dip-of-6-degrees-may-slide-tonight/articleshow/89102661.cms||Richa Pinto

HC directed MPSC to make arrangements to let these 86 appear for the next exam on January 29 but without creating equity in their favour in their challenge before Maharashtra Administrative Tribunal (MAT). There were 88 candidates who had challenged a prelim exam result on December 23, 2021, before MAT as they did not figure on the list for further exams. On December 24, an interim order declined them relief and 86 of them moved HC, said their lawyer Sandeep Dere, seeking orders to let them take the exam as the tribunal had adjourned on MPSC counsel’s request Monday’s hearing to February 22. The tribunal had not found arbitrary exercise of power by MPSC to warrant interim intervention. HC bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice M S Karnik said when two views are possible, it would not substitute its view unless the tribunal’s view is irrational. “We are not inclined to interfere, however what impels us to grant interim relief’’ is MPSC did not file its reply and its “lack of diligence’’ led to an adjournment by when the exam would be conducted and if the petitioners succeed before MAT, the selection process would be in “utter chaos”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mpsc-told-to-permit-86-more-candidates-to-take-jan-exam/articleshow/89102662.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Mumbai||IPO listings see 2L cr erosion, tech startups account for half||Mumbai/Bangalore: The selloff in the market in the past few weeks has wiped out over Rs 2 lakh crore from recently listed stocks that include leading ones like One97 Communications (Paytm), FSN E-Commerce Ventures (Nykaa), Zomato, PB Fintech (PolicyBazaar) and CarTrade. However, Nazara Technologies, a gaming company that is backed by billionaire investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, has remained mostly insulated from the recent rout in tech-enabled, consumer-facing companies.Consider this: Since listing a little over two months ago, Paytm, the digital money transfer pioneer in India, has lost nearly half its value to a current market capitalisation of Rs 59,472 crore. Worse, from its IPO price of Rs 2,150, at the current market price of Rs 917 on the BSE, it has lost over 57% of its value. Similarly, on Monday, Zomato lost 20% and closed at the lower circuit, while Nykaa, after dipping to its life-low of Rs 1,693 during the day, closed at Rs 1,735. These two stocks are still trading at a premium to their respective IPO prices, while Paytm, CarTrade and PolicyBazaar are in the red.Six tech-enabled, new age companies that listed in 2021 have together lost about Rs 1.2 lakh crore in market cap since listing. Nazara Tech, on the other hand, is still in the green with its market cap up nearly Rs 3,000 crore since debut.The selloff in the Indian market in these stocks is partially due to the recent tech rout in the US markets, traders said. In the US, the Nasdaq Composite index is down a little over 18% and could technically enter bear territory if it falls 20% or more from its recent peak in mid-November. There, experienced fund managers are moving from stocks of companies that offer high growth opportunities to those of established businesses, called value stocks. A similar trend is observed in India too, analysts said.According to Arun Kejriwal, director at the investment advisory firm KRIS, since mid-2021, some of the tech-enabled companies listed as the market was in a bull phase. Although most were loss-making, yet the stocks did well on the bourses, which in turn attracted a large number of investors. Now that there is a slide in the US market, these stocks are also facing heat from the selloff by local investors.“In the current situation, investors are sure to take a re-look at all recently listed stocks, particularly the loss-making ones,” Kejriwal said. For long, Dalal Street investors have not seen an IPO being withdrawn for lack of investor interest. “February-March could bring about an IPO that could bomb on the Street,” he said, indicating that we may soon witness an IPO being withdrawn.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/ipo-listings-see-2l-cr-erosion-tech-startups-account-for-half/articleshow/89102663.cms||Partha Sinha

State health minister Ma Subramanian released the MBBS/BDS rank lists for government quota and management quota seats, besides 7.5% reservation for government school students, on Monday. Namakkal student Geethanjali S A topped the rank list with 710 marks in NEET. As many as four students have obtained the identical score of 710 marks in this year's rank list and nine students out of the top 10 are from CBSE board. Manimaran M is the lone candidate from state board among the top 10. He scored 697 marks in NEET. The cut-off for general category last year for government medical colleges was 598 marks. This year, it is expected to come down to 588 marks. However, cut-off for government school students is expected to increase, as more students have scored above 250 marks this year. Subramanian said counselling will commence on January 27, with differently-abled candidates being the first category to be given admit cards. The in-person counselling for government school students will be conducted on January 28 and 29. "Online counselling for open category students will commence on January 30.

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Auto driver returns Rs 10,000 he got through wrong UPI transfer||BENGALURU: While auto drivers in Bengaluru often draw flak for overcharging and refusing to ply, a 58-year-old driver from Chamarajpet gave his passenger reason to cheer. Auto driver Gopi R promptly returned Rs 10,000 that was erroneously transferred to him after one ride. At 7.30am on Monday, Shiva Kumar G, an IT consultant and lawyer, boarded Gopi’s auto from Anand Rao Circle. His destination was Rajajinagar. At the end of the ride, the fare came to Rs 120, which Kumar paid using an UPI (Unified Payments Interface) application on his phone. Later in the day, one of Kumar’s friends needed Rs 10,000 and asked him to transfer the money through the same app. However, Kumar by mistake ended up sending the amount to Gopi instead of his friend. A shocked Kumar was unsure how to get the money back, as the amount was significantly large. But Gopi put all his apprehensions to rest when he learnt about the transaction. “Kumar called me when I was ferrying a passenger in my auto. Until then, I was not aware of the transaction. Later, when I checked my bank balance, I realised the amount I had was more than what it should have been. I confirmed to Kumar about receiving the money, but didn’t know how to operate the application on my own. I was able to get some help and successfully return the money to the rightful owner,” Gopi told TOI. Kumar tried to guide him through the process on the phone and was relieved when the money reached him. “I was full of appreciation for the auto driver. I submitted a letter detailing this incident to the city police commissioner and they too have taken note of his honesty and kindness. We should value and respect people who are ethical, so that their stories spread and society can learn from them,” said Kumar. “I have financial constraints and at times, even struggle to pay rent. But in no way will I keep someone else’s hard- earned money. If I work hard, I am sure others do too,” said Gopi. He used to drive heavy vehicles, but had to change his line of work due to unavailability of transportation assignments following the pandemic.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/auto-driver-returns-10k-he-got-through-wrong-upi-transfer/articleshow/89102676.cms||Sanika Athavale

Work is under way in Shivamogga, Mangaluru, Bengaluru, Tumakuru, Davanagere, Hubballi-Dharwad and Belagavi. Speaking to reporters after reviewing the progress, the minister said work picked up pace in the past two years. “Till March 2020, only works worth Rs 880 crore were completed. As of today, works worth Rs 2,646 crore have been completed. Besides, we have taken up 169 new ones worth Rs 1,554 crore. This is despite the scarcity of labour triggered by repeated lockdowns,” he said. He also claimed Karnataka is second in the country in floating tenders on time, fourth in issuing work orders, and sixth in completing works. Apart from pace, the government has also ensured quality of work, the minister added. “We set up Smart City advisory forums in all seven cities consisting of local MPs, MLAs, mayors, DCs and technical experts. These forums will decide on addition and deletion of work and sort out problems arising on the spot,” he said. To speed up work, contractors have been told to deploy labourers and machinery. “We haveimposed a fine of Rs 3.4 crore on contractors for delaying work in these cities,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/smart-city-work-will-be-over-ahead-of-time-min/articleshow/89102677.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Hesaraghatta’s 5k acres may become conservation reserve||Bengaluru: A decade-long movement by citizens and environmentalists to protect Bengaluru’s grassland ecosystem at Hesaraghatta seems to be finally yielding some results. Forest minister Umesh V Katti directed his department to submit a proposal at the next wildlife board meeting on declaring nearly 5,010 acres of Hesaraghatta open land as Greater Hesaraghatta Conservation Reserve. The direction came at a virtual event on Saturday where the minister interacted with environmentalists on the need to conserve wetlands, grasslands, catchments and waterways for a better Bengaluru. “The minister was convinced about the proposal and the importance of safeguarding such an ecosystem and agreed to bring it before the board at the next meeting. Hopefully, it will get approved this time,” said Siddharth Goenka, member of the state wildlife board. This recommendation has been pending before the government since 2013. If the board approves it, it will put a blanket ban on commercial exploitation and illegal activities in the area. In January last year, the board, then headed by former chief minister BS Yediyurappa, rejected the proposal, allegedly under pressure from Yelahanka MLA SR Vishwanath who opposed the move even though many board members favoured it.According to officials, the government can declare any land, excluding the designated national park or sanctuary, as conservation reserve under Section 36C of Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. However, environmentalists fighting for the cause are sceptical the government will approve the proposal considering the real estate lobby and the fact that their own party MLA is opposing it.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/hesaraghattas-5k-acres-may-become-conservation-reserve/articleshow/89102680.cms||---

Two accidents involving BMTC buses were reported on Monday alone. In Malleswaram, a two-wheeler rider was killed by a BMTC bus at 6.30am. In another incident, a BMTC bus hit the median near Thirumagondanahalli, close to Bommasandra on Hosur Road at 8.50am, leaving the conductor injured. “In Malleswaram, a two-wheeler rider suddenly came from a cross-road and the driver swerved the bus to save him, but couldn’t avert the accident. In Thirumagondanahalli, the driver lost control and hit the median. In both cases, over-speeding appears to have led to the accidents, but investigation is on. In fact, the driver who was involved in the Thirumagondanahalli accident was earlier warned for over-speeding,” said a BMTC official. On Friday, 25 passengers had a narrow escape after a BMTC bus (KA-57 F1592) caught fire near Makkalakoota signal, close to KR Market, reportedly due to a short circuit. Officials said probe is on. According to BMTC records, the number of bus breakdowns in the city increased from 1,243 in 2018-19 to 1,284 in 2019-20. However, the number of accidents involving BMTC buses reduced from 286 in 2018-19 to 224 in 2019-20. BMTC managing director V Anbu Kumar said: “The Thirumagondanahalli accident was due to negligence of the driver and we have decided to take action against him. We have also checked the visuals of the Malleswaram accident. The two-wheeler rider entered the road without checking for other vehicles on the main road, but the bus too was over-speeding, so the driver also couldn’t save him. We condemn both accidents and will take suitable action.” Kumar said they are running 5,500 buses covering 50,000 trips and 10 lakh km a day. “The number of accidents involving BMTC buses is less than 1%. We will train our staff to reduce accidents. Around 2,000 buses from the current fleet have covered 8 lakh km. We will scrap these aged buses next year, once they touch 9 lakh km. The bus catching fire was a rare instance. Though it had nothing to do with maintenance, we have decided to take the matter seriously,” he added. Lack of maintenanceA BMTC driver on condition of anonymity, said: “There was no focus on maintenance of buses for the past two years, especially after Covid-19 hit. Many over-aged buses are still running. There is also shortage of spare parts due to financial crunch. But drivers are often made scapegoats for these accidents, even though many of them are due to brake failures.” Sources said many drivers are often stressed to complete trips on time, due to which they tend to over-speed and drive recklessly. There have been many complaints about brake lights of buses not working. Damages & costStatistics show BMTC’s average vehicle damage losses between 2012 and 2016 stood at around Rs 1.8 crore per year, while legal fees and compensations paid from 2012 to 2016 came to Rs 9 crore annually. With BMTC having taken an exemption from paying vehicle insurance, the transport corporation has to bear costs of compensation payouts from its own kitty.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/back-to-back-accidents-put-bmtc-under-lens-md-says-will-take-action/articleshow/89102684.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

While Kranti Rath Yatra will seek proper implementation of Article 371(J), that provides special status to the KK region, the padayatra will urge the government for expeditious implementation of Kalasa-Banduri project that envisages drinking water to the parched districts of Kittur Karnataka. Prior to these, the party will resume Mekedatu padayatra from Ramanagara where it was suspended on January 13 owing to surging Covid cases and a public interest litigation filed in the high court. As the padayatra covered around 70km for five days from Mekedatu to Kanakapura, the party will restart it soon after the third wave recedes and cover another 100km to reach Bengaluru where the march will culminate in a public meeting. “Plans are afoot to take out all three yatras and we’re just waiting for improvement in the Covid situation. We’ll first finish Mekedatu padayatra and then launch the other two,” said KPCC working president Saleem Ahmed. The Congress is embarking on its protest programme notwithstanding chief minister Basavaraj Bommai’s announcement that he will call an all-party meeting on water issues, following a review meet he convened on Saturday. “The Congress is only trying to play politics; it is not interested in getting justice to people. In fact, Mekedatu padayatra has worsened the situation as it prompted Tamil Nadu to announce its Hogenakkal phase-2 project proposal,” said water resources minister Govind Karjol. The Supreme Court has postponed hearing of a petition filed by Tamil Nadu against Mekedatu project from Tuesday (January 25) to February 16. Karnataka on Monday requested the SC to reconstitute the bench hearing the Krishna river water dispute as two judges have recused themselves and list the Mahadayi case at the earliest. “The government is taking all these steps only after we started the agitation. So, the programmes like padayatras that we’ve planned are necessary,” said former water resources minister and Congress MLA MB Patil. Congress MLA Priyank Kharge said Kalyana Kharge Kranti Yatra aims to pressure the government to reconstitute Kalyana Karnataka Regional Development Board (KKRDB), constituted under Article 371(J) to ensure special provision for development of the region, even as the government is dithering on nominating members to it. “The CM had promised in the assembly on September 23 last year that KKRDB members would be appointed in 10 days, but he failed to keep his word. The fight is against this indifference,” said Kharge.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/cong-plans-yatras-in-kittur-kalyana-karnataka-regions/articleshow/89102693.cms||B V Shiva Shankar
---||Mysuru||Congress plans yatras in Kittur, Kalyana Karnataka regions||BENGALURU: After the controversial Mekedatu padayatra, which supposedly gave much-needed traction to the party in old Mysuru region, the Congress is planning yatras in Kalyana Karnataka and Kittur Karnataka regions.

Her counsel submitted that she has been in custody for the last two years serving the default sentence and can be released extending the benefit under section 428 of CrPC.Rejecting the request, Justice Sreenivas Harish Kumar said the section deals with setting off the period spent by an offender in jail and in the case on hand, the trial court has not awarded a sentence of imprisonment to her. “In all these cases, the petitioner has been directed to undergo simple imprisonment in case she defaults in paying the fine amount. Therefore, if she is serving the default sentence, it is always consecutive and benefit under section 428 of CrPC cannot be granted,” the judge stated. With regard to her six appeals, the judge noted that the petitioner has admitted her signature on all the dishonoured cheques. “Her specific defence is that she did not borrow money and on the other hand, the cheques issued by her were misused by the respondents. But the trial court said since the petitioner herself admitted in the insolvency petition filed in the City Civil Court that she was indebted to many persons, including the respondents, and that she owed Rs 32 lakh to the latter, her defence is improbable and held her guilty under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The findings of the trial court have been confirmed by the appellate court... The findings on facts cannot be disturbed,” the judge observed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/hc-dismisses-womans-plea-in-cheque-case/articleshow/89102696.cms||---

The child's mother, grandmother and six others were also arrested on Sunday night from Balapur when the deal was being struck. Police were tipped off by locals. Police said that accused Syed Althaf Ali had divorced his wife about six years ago and had been looking for someone to take care of him. Ali found the 14-year-old through auto driver Akeel Ahmed (34) from Balapur who was introduced to him by common friends. Ahmed along with Zareena Begum, Shabana Begum, Shameen Sulthan, Nasreen Begum, Zahaid Bee, all from Balapur, in their first meeting had offered the mother and grandmother of the child Rs 5 lakh to send her with Ali. But the deal did not work out as Ali refused to pay more than Rs 3 lakh. Recently, the girl's family ended up in financial problems as her uncle met with an accident. The mother then agreed to sell the girl for Rs 3 lakh, Balapur inspector B Bhaskar said, adding that the father had deserted the family long ago. On Sunday, when Ali reached the house of Zareena Begum in Balapur to finalise the deal, police arrested them. The accused were booked under IPC sections 370, 370 (A) r/w 511, Section 17 of Pocso Act and Section 3&5 of PITA.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/mum-man-tries-to-buy-14-yr-old-girl-in-hyd-held/articleshow/89102701.cms||---
---||Chennai||Chennai: Roads laid too high, rules given go-by||CHENNAI: Everyone from the chief minister down has inspected the new roads being laid across the city. However,, on many stretches the height of the road rises in defiance of government orders.  It is not just on the interior roads where milling machinery cannot enter but also on bus routes that are wide enough. For instance, the height of the road laid last week on Raghavan Street in Perambur had increased by at least six inches when measured using tape. Raghukumar Choodamani, a local civic activist, said, “This will cause inundation during rains. We have raised complaints. The Indian Road Congress (IRC) rules clearly specify that the roads should be milled to a height of 40mm and a bituminous concrete be laid to the same height. However, in our locality, the contractors milled the road only to 20mm.” It was also found that some roads were relaid in less than two years. The road on Rajabather Street was laid in 2019-20. It has been relaid in 2021-22. Similarly, the road on Raghavan Street was laid in 2017-2018 at 19 lakh, has been re-laid twice later – once in 2019-2020 at 21 lakh and again now in 2022. "Frequent re-laying of the road will only increase its height. The IRC rules specify that the roads should be re-laid only once in five years, while the State government rules say they shouldn’t be damaged for at least three years,” Raghu said. In localities such as Ayyappan Koil in Nanganallur and Kamaraj Nagar in Perungudi, the bituminous layer was laid over concrete road, and milling wasn’t carried out.  In Besant Nagar and Nungambakkam, the height of the re-laid roads had increased by 20mm when measured. S Rajendiran, chief engineer of roads in the corporation, said for stretches where the base layer is less than 20mm in height, permissions were taken to re-lay roads without milling. Activists say the critical issue is not milling but increase in the height of the road. Jayaram Venkatesan, convenor of Arappor Iyakkam, said, “The order of the chief secretary says the road height shouldn't be increased at any cost.” In some parts of the city where the height of the bituminous layer is 2-3 feet, the residents have requested the corporation to ensure milling for a deeper depth before re-laying them. However, engineers said it was not possible as such work would disturb the utilities.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/roads-laid-too-high-rules-given-go-by/articleshow/89102708.cms||Komal Gautham

The SHRC held that police not providing medical records while remanding the petitioner lent truth to the allegation that she was beaten and warned against mentioning the same to the magistrate. This was substantiated by medical report from the jail authorities. According to a petition from S Sundari, her family owns a property at S Kolathur near Madipakkam. On February 21, 2011, she got a phone call from a sub-inspector, asking her to come to the police station for an inquiry. Since personnel at the station said the SI had gone to the property, Sundari and her family members went to the site to find the fence being removed by private persons. When they tried to intervene, police personnel took them to the police station where they were beaten up by the police, according to the complaint. The petitioner claimed the then inspector at Madipakkam police station foisted a case against her family members and they were sent to remand. In response, the retired police officer stated that he had received a complaint stating that the petitioner’s family was illegally claiming ownership of two plots and that the revenue officials had confirmed this. One of the complainants had sought police protection to carry out some work on the property after the petitioner’s husband attacked one of the workers and the petitioner was arrested following due process. After perusing all submissions, SHRC member A Chittaranjan Mohandoss held that there was human rights violation in the way the police handled the case, that they acted in a biased manner and that the petitioner is entitled to receive compensation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/pay-50k-to-victim-of-police-excess/articleshow/89102717.cms||---

---||Chennai||Chennai may get rain followed by drop in temperature||CHENNAI: Some parts of the suburbs received short spells of rain while the city experienced an overcast weather on Monday. Weathermen said the city and the suburbs have chances of getting light rain at least for the next two days while coastal areas have a possibility of receiving light to moderate spells at least for the next four days. By the end of the month, however, humidity may drop, and winter-like conditions may return with coastal areas like Chennai also likely to experience temperatures a degree or two below normal at night. For the next 48 hours, IMD has forecast light rain over some areas in the city and the suburbs while the skies may be generally cloudy. Maximum and minimum temperatures may be around 29°C and 24°C. “This is because a feeble trough, which is an elongated region of relatively low pressure, is extending from Orissa to south coastal Andhra Pradesh. So, there may be some patchy rainfall,” a meteorologist said. According to IMD’s five-day forecast for the state, light to moderate rainfall is likely to occur at isolated places over coastal Tamil Nadu till January 28 while the rain may spread to some adjoining districts, Ariyalur and Trichy starting from January 26. On Monday Meenambakkam station recorded 17.8mm till 8.30am and some traces of rainfall till 5.30pm while Nungambakkam remained cloudy and dry. Maximum temperatures dropped to 29.7°C and 29.1°C in Nungambakkam and Meenambakkam, which were 0.2C and 1°C below normal while minimums rose to 24.2°C and 21.1°C in both the stations, which were 3.2°C and 0.3°C above normal. But by the end of the month, the weather conditions may change, and temperatures may begin dropping. “The cold northerly winds are touching up to Telangana where temperatures have already dropped five to six degrees below normal. It was delayed in Tamil Nadu due to the cloud formation. By the end of the month, we can expect minimum temperatures to drop in Tamil Nadu including coastal areas,” said Mahesh Palawat, chief meteorologist, Skymet Weather. Blogger Pradeep John in his tweet said coastal areas might also experience foggy conditions due to warm dry winds moving over cold land areas in the mornings.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/city-may-get-rain-followed-by-drop-in-temp/articleshow/89102720.cms||---

The bench made the observation while hearing a batch of public interest writ petitions seeking deferment of the elections in view of the third wave of the pandemic. “Unnecessarily we should not create panic,” the judges said, referring to the latest WHO reports and considering the recent decline in Covid-19 cases in major cities like Chennai. The government and the SEC are mindful, a circular on protocols and precautionary methods to be followed from nomination to declaration of the elections was also released earlier, the court added. Earlier, representing one of the petitioners, senior advocate S Prabakaran submitted that with the spread of new variants, surge of Covid-19 cases and containment of zones it is risky to conduct the elections. The bench wondered as to why the petitioners were not approaching the SC before where pleas regarding the elections were already pending.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/hc-wont-defer-civic-polls-but-monitor-it-for-pandemic-protocol/articleshow/89102722.cms||---

The first bench of Acting Chief Justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari and Justice P D Audikesavalu issued the direction on Monday, pointing out that only the state home secretary should head the commission as per the rules. The court then directed the state to clarify as to whether the rules had been amended to appoint a retired judge of the court as the head of the commission. To this, advocate-general R Shanmugasundaram submitted that the appointment had been made as per the directions of a division bench of the court. Recording the same, the court directed the AG to produce a copy of the judgment by January 31. The issue pertains to a batch of pleas challenging the validity of certain provisions of the Tamil Nadu Police (Reforms) Act, 2013. The petitioners also wanted the court to direct the state government to constitute an independent police complaints committee as directed by the Supreme Court to go into complaints of police brutality and torture. According to the petitioners, the Apex Court has made it clear that the committee shall comprise independent panel members nominated by the Chief Justice of the high court.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/can-ex-judge-head-tn-police-commission-hc-asks-govt/articleshow/89102723.cms||---

The statement came after two days ago Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari at a public event said the NHAI was finding it difficult to source construction aggregates and getting environmental clearances in Tamil Nadu due to its bureaucratic system. As a result, NHAI had foreclosed four major highway projects last year. So, Gadkari urged Stalin to look into the issues and resolve them. In a letter to Gadkari, Stalin said, "Considering the efforts taken by the state government and the resultant progress in the field, your statement has been a bit surprising to me." Stalin said around 80% of the issues were resolved through meetings participated by collectors, NHAI officials, contractors and top bureaucrats. Further, the issues relating to specific projects, whenever highlighted by NHAI, (like Vikaravandi – Kumbakonam – Thanjavur Road and Melur – Karaikudi Road) have been resolved with interventions of state highways minister EV Velu and chief secretary V Irai Anbu, he said. The chief minister said NHAI too has to take some corrective measures, which are causing delays. For instance, NHAI in some cases has not agreed to the valuation of land fixed by the Competent Authority for Land Acquisition (CALA) or the arbitration awards given by the collectors, putting the process in limbo. Similarly, in many cases applications seeking permission to borrow land are being given without the requisite documents. In some instances, the applications have been given for sites which are not feasible due to stagnation of water in ponds/ tanks or falling in eco sensitive zones. Such applications need to be scrutinised before submission, he said. Since Tamil Nadu has two spells of monsoon and generally tanks/ponds are under water for six months, permission to borrow land is granted for three months. However, considering the request given by NHAI, Stalin said action is being taken to amend the mining rules to give permits for longer periods.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/gadkaris-remarks-on-challenges-in-tn-road-projects-surprising/articleshow/89102725.cms||---

His prolific form in front of the goal also saw him making a move to RB Leipzig at the start of this season and the 26-year-old Portuguese has continued to impress at his new club too.While Silva’s primary target now is to help Leipzig, currently sixth in the Bundesliga, reach the top-four at the end of the season, he has also started preparing for Portugal’s crucial World Cup playoff round to be held in March this year.Portugal finished second behind Serbia in the group stage of qualifying and will now have to go through the playoff path in which they have been drawn with four-time world champions Italy. While Portugal will face Turkey in the semifinals on March 24, Italy will host North Macedonia on the same night. The winners of the semis will face each other in the final for a place at the Qatar World Cup to be held from November 21 to December 18 this year.The match is still more than two months away but Silva says he is mentally gearing up to help the 2016 Euro champions reach the quadrennial event in Qatar. “We want to achieve this World Cup goal badly and are totally focused. I believe we will surely qualify and we realise that we have to give more than 100 per cent to achieve our target. And we will do everything we can to qualify,” Silva said during a virtual media interaction recently.The World Cup will also be 36-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo’s last shot at the title and Silva wants to do it for his legendary Portuguese teammate. “I was young when Cristiano was charting his own path to success. All the kids started emulating him, including myself. When I got to play with him for Portugal, I got a chance to get close to him and know him better. Of course, I learnt from him and became a better player while working on all his tips. When we play together or in training he is always helping his teammates get better. Now, it is our turn to repay him,” Silva asserted.Elaborating on the tips Ronaldo had offered him, Silva said: “I remember the best thing which he told me was during a training session when we were practising free-kicks. He told me to change my foot position and how that would help me while taking a free-kick. It was a very small adjustment but it brought about a big change in the way I take free-kicks now. So he has obviously helped me grow as a footballer,” Silva waxed eloquent on the Manchester United striker.Watch RB Leipzig and other Bundesliga matches LIVE on Sony Sports Network||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/its-our-turn-to-take-ronaldo-to-wc-silva/articleshow/89102728.cms||---

KRMB had submitted the first report in response to a petition filed in NGT by nine residents of Andhra Pradesh against Telangana's PRLIS. The board had filed another report in NGT in response to a petition filed by the Andhra Pradesh government against Dindi LIS. "PRLIS and Dindi LIS in Telangana are listed as major, ongoing, unapproved and non-operational in the gazette. The DPRs are required to be approved by the apex council within six months after publication of the notification. However, we haven't received the DPRs in respect of PRLIS and Dindi LIS," KRBM executive engineer Iva Sankaraiah informed the NGT. He recalled that the notification clause states that if any such completed unapproved projects in both the states must cease to operate if they fail to get approval. As per the minutes of the second apex council meeting held on October 10 2020, it was resolved that both the states would submit DPRs of new projects to the boards immediately for appraisal and for subsequent sanction by the apex council. Both the chief ministers agreed to submit DPRs. On July 15, 2021, the Union ministry of jal shakti had notified the jurisdiction of Krishna River Management Board, which provides the required authority and power to the board in terms of administration, regulation, operation and maintenance of listed projects on Krishna river in the two States. "Both the state governments shall stop all ongoing works on unapproved projects as on the date of publication of the notification until the said projects are appraised and approved as per the provisions of the (AP Reorganisation) Act in accordance with the decision taken in the second meeting of the apex council. If approvals are not obtained within six months after the publication of the notification, full or partial operations, if any of the said ongoing unapproved projects, shall cease to operate," it said. "Within six months of the publication of the notification both state governments shall complete the unapproved projects appraised and approved as per the provision of the second meeting of apex council. If approvals are not obtained within the stipulated time of six months, such completed unapproved project shall cease to operate," it added. As per KRMB records, Telangana, through a GO, had accorded administrative approval for Rs 35,200 crore to take up PRLIS for irrigating an ayucut of 10 lakh acres and providing drinking water during flood season to the drought-prone areas of Mahabubnagar, Rangareddy and Nalgonda districts. Telangana has also approved Rs 6,190 crore for Dindi LIS, which envisages providing drinking water to fluorosis-affected areas and irrigation facilities to drought-prone areas of Nalgonda and Mahabubnagar districts.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/krmb-to-ngt-t-didnt-submit-dprs-for-palamuru-dindi-lifts/articleshow/89102730.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

Chief election commissioner Sushil Chandra, in a televised address on the eve of National Voters Day celebrated each year on January 25, said the strength of the total electorate in the country, as of today, stood at 95.1 crore. Compared to 91.2 crore eligible electors at the time of 2019 general election to the Lok Sabha, this translates into an approximate 4.3% increase. Chandra said that among the 95.1 crore voters as on date, 49 crore were male and 46.1 crore female, 1.9 crore senior citizens above 80 years of age, 81.4 lakh persons with disabilities and 19.2 lakh from the services. He added that the number of newly-registered voters as on date stood at 1.4 crore, as compared to 1.5 crore voters aged between 18 and 19 years who were eligible to vote for the first time in 2019 Lok Sabha poll. The CEC further said that nearly 25 lakh new voters are eligible to vote in the current assembly polls in the states of UP, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Goa and Manipur. Incidentally, the commission has been relentlessly working to push up the enrolment of female voters who are old enough to exercise their franchise but were not yet registered in the rolls. Even ahead of announcing the current assembly polls in five states, the EC had undertaken a special exercise to identify areas with less female voter enrollment in states like UP and reached out to them through local staff including Asha workers to motivate them to come forward and register themselves as voters. Chandra said that the government recently amended Representation of the People Act to allow new voters to enroll on four different dates in a year against a single date earlier.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/female-voters-up-5-1-male-3-6-since-2019-lok-sabha-polls-cec/articleshow/89102669.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: MIM former leader gets life for murder||HYDERABAD: A former vice chairman of Adilabad municipality was sentenced to life imprisonment for firing at political rivals and killing a former municipal councillor during an argument over street cricket in December 2020. Mohammed Farooq Ahmed (45), a former district leader of AIMIM, was also fined Rs 12,000 by a special court in Adilabad while acquitting two other accused. On December 18, 2020, Farooq had picked up an argument with rivals Syed Zameer (60), his brother Syed Mannan, latter's son Mohtesin (18) and others over street cricket at Tatigadda colony in Adilabad town. "When Farooq's teenage son wanted to play, Mannan's son asked him to buy a cricket ball to join. Things soon escalated into an argument between elders of both the families," Adilabad II Town CI P Srinivas said. During the argument, Farooq pulled out a revolver and shot Mohtesin in the waist. When Zameer tried to intervene, Farooq shot him twice and also attacked Mannan on the head with a sword, special public prosecutor M Ramana Reddy said. Zameer succumbed while undergoing treatment in Hyderabad. Police filed a chargesheet against three including Farooq in March 2021 and based on Adilabad police request the high court transferred the case to the first additional sessions court of Adilabad, which treated it as a special case. After the chargesheet was filed, Farooq had attempted to end his life in Adilabad prison. "Farooq was convicted for murder, attempt to murder and using a firearm without licence. Farooq's licence had expired, which he had not renewed," Reddy said. The video of the incident recorded on the mobile by the son of the deceased, bullets recovered from the bodies of the victims, the statements of eyewitnesses and forensic experts played a key role in securing the conviction.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/mim-former-leader-gets-life-for-murder/articleshow/89102742.cms||---

The survey, commissioned by the Karnataka Evaluation Authority, has also revealed that 45 % bicycles are used by family members of the students. “Less than half of the beneficiaries, overall, bring bicycles to school regularly. Regular bicycle usage is even less among girls. Road conditions, houses being near the school, frequent damage of cycles and houses being too far are some of the reasons for non-usage. Statistical tests show that road conditions have a significant effect on the regular usage of bicycles,” the survey, done across eight districts, found out. Yadgir, Kalaburagi, Uttar Kannada and Belagavi from north Karnataka were among the surveyed districts. The survey has also pointed out that only 13% beneficiaries receive the cycles in first two months --- June and July --- of the academic year. “Current dates for procurement, bid evaluation and selection of supplier are not early enough to ensure timely supply of cycles to students, since it takes 90-120 days for the supplier to provide the cycles and other processes such as quality checks at various levels and assembly,” the survey found out. The survey also pointed out that the bicycles were of poor quality. “More than 40% students reported that parts of the cycle were missing in the newly received bicycles and had to add parts such as a bell or a seat cover. Bicycle quality is seen to deteriorate year on year after receipt. While 8% bicycles were damaged at receipt (as evident from beneficiary survey responses), 24% one-year-old cycles and 33% two-year-old cycles checked through direct observation were damaged. More than 40% used bicycles had defects on parameters such as a rusted frame, worn gear teeth and rusted forks. Rusted brakes and locks are common quality defects of used cycles. According to the parents, the bicycles become unusable by the time students reaches Class X,” the survey said. Box Key findings: * Around 72% of total surveyed beneficiaries (about 74.1% female & 69.8% male) said they face difficulty riding bicycles because of the difficult terrain and sometimes bad roads. According to 18 per cent respondents, the roads between their house and school are filled with potholes. * Approximately 46.2% of respondents bring bicycles regularly to school. 17.9% said the cycles got damaged frequently so they did not bring them to school regularly. On average, an individual needs to spend around 100 rupees a month to keep the cycle running. * After receiving a bicycle, 49% respondents preferred using them. * There has been significant improvement in the overall confidence level of students after receiving bicycles. Approximately 90% respondents were found to be happy all the time with 32% boys and 20% girls showed confidence in travelling to places other than their school alone. *Approximately 72% surveyed principals said they have formed a school inspection/quality check committee. Members of both school and district inspection/quality check committees were quoted as saying that they had not undergone mandated technical training for doing the quality checks.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/bicycles-distributed-by-government-help-improve-attendance-at-schools/articleshow/89100725.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

Digital payments like UPI are electronic instructions that authorise intermediaries such as banks to facilitate transactions. Even if they are ‘cashless’ modes of payment, they involve transfer of fiat money (government-issued currency). Now imagine a UPI-like system where digital currency issued by a central bank is transacted instead of bank balances. The need for interbank settlement disappears and you have the option to pay someone securely, without third-party risks. What if money itself could be ‘digital’? The RBI has called for a complete ban on crypto as it believes partial restrictions won’t work. But, at the same time, it is considering issuing its own digital currency by leveraging the technology that powers crypto. “A central bank digital currency (CBDC) would also potentially enable more real-time and cost-effective globalisation of payment systems. Time zone difference would no longer matter,” said T Rabi Shankar, RBI deputy governor, in a speech last year. The RBI defines a CBDC as a legal tender issued by a central bank in a digital form. “It is the same as a fiat currency and is exchangeable one-to-one with the fiat currency. Only its form is different,” said Shankar. The RBI is working towards a phased implementation strategy to minimise disruption. But what is the need for a CBDC in India where cash is popular? According to Shankar, countries with significant cash usage are seeking to make issuance more efficient as CBDCs can reduce the cost of distributing money. Cryptocurrencies came up in the last decade promising secure, anonymous, and efficient transactions. However, being decentralised — which means no authority can regulate them — privately issued virtual currencies threaten state control over money. A US Federal Reserve paper released last week, seeking public opinion on the CBDC, noted that CBDCs’ foundation — a combination of cryptographic and distributed-ledger (blockchain) technologies — was created by crypto. But apart from the underlying technology, there are no similarities between crypto and CBDCs, say legal experts. “People are not acquiring crypto to transact, they are investing because they believe the asset would appreciate as the value of fiat currency deteriorates due to excess supply,” said Manvinder Singh, partner, J Sagar Associates. He added that the CBDC is expected to be a mode of payment and not an asset like crypto. According to a report by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), about 86% of the world’s central banks are doing research on CBDCs, which would help preserve public ‘trust’ in money and provide electronic convenience. However, CBDCs could disrupt the status quo of The RBI’s deputy governor too noted the risk of banks’ credit-creation ability getting constrained. “It is important to design & implement CBDC in a way that makes the demand for CBDC, vis a vis bank deposits, manageable,” he said. Authorities have the option to allow CBDCs only for wholesale use (like inter-bank transfers) initially to minimise disruption in commercial bank operations. A legal framework would also need to choose either a distributed or centralised ledger, define the level of anonymity and role of banks, and address cybersecurity concerns. While the advent of crypto has indirectly advanced the development of CBDCs, the concept is not recent. In the 1980s, American economist and Nobel laureate James Tobin had suggested that Federal Reserve Banks in the US could make available a widely accessible “medium with the convenience of deposits and the safety of currency”. According to the BIS report, 14% of the world’s central banks, led by the Chinese regulator, were deploying CBDC pilot projects. The first government-backed paper currency too was issued in China in the 1120s.

However, Nazara Technologies, a gaming company that is backed by billionaire investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, has remained mostly insulated from the recent rout in tech-enabled, consumer-facing companies. Consider this: Since listing a little over two months ago, Paytm, the digital money transfer pioneer in India, has lost nearly half its value to a current market capitalisation of Rs 59,472 crore. Worse, from its IPO price of Rs 2,150, at the current market price of Rs 917 on the BSE, it has lost over 57% of its value. Similarly, on Monday, Zomato lost 20% and closed at the lower circuit, while Nykaa, after dipping to its life-low of Rs 1,693 during the day, closed at Rs 1,735. These two stocks are still trading at a premium to their respective IPO prices, while Paytm, CarTrade and PolicyBazaar are in the red. Six tech-enabled, new age companies that listed in 2021 have together lost about Rs 1.2 lakh crore in market cap since listing. Nazara Tech, on the other hand, is still in the green with its market cap up nearly Rs 3,000 crore since debut. The selloff in the Indian market in these stocks is partially due to the recent tech rout in the US markets, traders said. In the US, the Nasdaq Composite index is down a little over 18% and could technically enter bear territory if it falls 20% or more from its recent peak in mid-November. There, experienced fund managers are moving from stocks of companies that offer high growth opportunities to those of established businesses, called value stocks. A similar trend is observed in India too, analysts said. According to Arun Kejriwal, director at the investment advisory firm KRIS, since mid-2021, some of the tech-enabled companies listed as the market was in a bull phase. Although most were loss-making, yet the stocks did well on the bourses, which in turn attracted a large number of investors. Now that there is a slide in the US market, these stocks are also facing heat from the strong selloff by local investors. “In the current situation, investors are sure to take a re-look at all recently listed stocks, particularly the loss-making ones,” Kejriwal said. For long, Dalal Street investors have not seen an IPO being withdrawn for lack of investor interest. “February-March could bring about an IPO that could bomb on the Street,” he said, indicating that we may soon witness an IPO being withdrawn. Additionally, since the Covid-led pandemic started in March 2020, a large number of new investors with no experience of a bear market had started investing. A large chunk of these investors had invested in these tech-enabled stocks. With these stocks showing some weakness, some of these new age investors are now panicking and selling, creating a vicious cycle of a slide in stock prices & panic selling, more slide & more panic selling, a stock dealer said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ipo-listings-see-rs-2l-cr-erosion-tech-startups-account-for-half/articleshow/89101838.cms||Partha Sinha

Further, SpiceJet has been asked to submit a list of all the employees on February 5 who were so appointed under the fixed-term contract basis for the last 2-10 years so that the work would be provided to them on a seniority basis and, in any case, without employing contract workers in their place. The airline had earlier this month challenged the industrial tribunal order. The HC heard advocates Mahesh Shukla for SpiceJet and advocate Jaiprakash Sawant for the All India SpiceJet Staff and Employees Association for “quite some time”, according to the order. The association submitted that the workmen were terminated from January 1 despite a status quo order passed by the Central Government Industrial Tribunal, Mumbai on December 29. The airline management said the workmen were on fixed-term contracts and they have not been terminated but their term of employment expired. However, Justice Ghuge made it clear in his order that, “Insofar as the contention of the management that Section2(oo)(bb) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 would be applicable to the case of these workmen, I am afraid that when these workmen have been working, though on contracts of service, for tenures of 24 months under each contract, for about 8-9 years, Section 2(oo)(bb) would have no application.” The section says termination of employment on non-renewal of employment agreement upon its expiry shall not be considered as ‘retrenchment’. The workmen said they were appointed by SpiceJet on fixed-term contracts in the beginning but given extension for years and must be continued and no contract workers be employed in their place. The HC posted the airline’s petition for urgent hearing on February 8 and said “until further orders, the respondent-union would not precipitate the issue by filing any application for execution of the impugned interim order”. It also directed the company that status quo “be maintained as existing today and no new contractual employees or personnel be deployed by any agency”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hc-spicejet-cant-use-new-contractual-employees/articleshow/89101910.cms||Swati Deshpande

Digital health and wellness platform HealthifyMe saw 2.3x growth in new and old user subscriptions so far in the month of January, 2022, much higher than the previous months. HealthifyMe saw a 22% rise in transaction volume for home workouts and personal training since omicron hit in the month of January, as compared to a 15% growth in the same month last year. Its co-founder and CEO Tushar Vashisht said though there is a steady growth in new user registrations in the month of January, the revenue grew from Rs 15 crore in January, 2021 to Rs 35 crore in January, 2022. This is more than double, recording the strongest January sales so far, he added. The average age of customer stands between 30-35 years on these platforms. Vashisht said “Not just for weight loss, but there is a clear demand for specific-ailment oriented wellness and nutrition programs in recent times. More people want to keep disorders like diabetic, PCOS under control. Another online fitness platform Fittr, saw its monthly average value of user subscription under its fitness and nutrition (F&N) services category increased from Rs 10,235 in 2021 to Rs 12,000 in January, 2022. Its co-founder Jyoti Dabas says this is largely driven by rising demand for premium Fitness & Nutrition packages. “The month of January is one of the peak months for fitness. On the value terms we saw revenue growth of 60% in January, 2022, much higher than the previous months, which was largely driven by demand for standard and premium training with experienced coaches. Although renewal of membership took a slight hit in the early days of January, 2022, it picked up in the last five days,” she added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/home-workouts-digi-fitness-under-the-spotlight-amid-rising-omicron-infections/articleshow/89101269.cms||Mamtha Asokan
---||Dehradun||LPG cylinders below Rs 500 if Cong voted to power in U'khand: Baghel||Dehradun: Congress on Monday said it will bring down prices of domestic LPG cylinder to below Rs 500 in Uttarakhand if the party is voted to power. Launching the theme song of party’s election campaign, “Char Dham, Char Kaam (four shrines, four projects), in Dehradun, Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel also said Rs 40,000 per annum would be given to five lakh poor families to lead a ‘dignified life’.” He announced that four lakh jobs would be provided to youths. “We will also come up with a scheme to provide certain health facilities at people’s doorsteps,” Baghel said. Addressing media persons in Dehradun, Baghel said, “We have identified four major issues – inflation, unemployment, LPG prices and health services – faced by the people of Uttarakhand, and Congress has decided to come up with some promises in the party’s election manifesto.” “When BJP came to power, LPG cylinder used to cost less than Rs 400, but now it has more than doubled,” Baghel said, adding unemployment and inflation are major issues bothering the people of the country and the state. Health care services are a matter of concern in Uttarakhand due to its geographical locations and difficult terrain. “We will use technology to ensure that the best possible health facilities are provided at people’s doorsteps. If required, we will use drone technology to improve health care services,” he said. Baghel also said BJP has “cheated” the people of Uttarakhand by giving them three “incompetent” CMs in five years. “They (three CMs) were afraid of contesting elections, addressed coronavirus as ‘ Corona ji’ and claimed that the US ruled the country for 200 years. This shows the level of their incompetence. I am confident that Congress will come to power in Uttarakhand,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/lpg-cylinders-below-rs-500-if-cong-voted-to-power-in-ukhand-baghel/articleshow/89099043.cms||Kautilya Singh

The arrests have solved 10 such cases, police claimed. The accused have been identified as Mukesh Kumar Singh (19) and Dular Kumar Mandal (21), both previously involved in a cheating case, Dular’s brother, Pintu (22), a compounder at a clinic, and Chetlal (24), who also has a criminal record. Seven mobile phones and SIM cards, Rs 1 lakh, a car bought from the cheated money and documents have been seized. A complaint was received on the home ministry cyber crime portal from one Arvind, who alleged that on January 13, he received a message from a mobile phone number with a link for KYC of his wallet. He clicked on it and filled all details, including password, OTP, card number and CVV, police said. “Immediately, he got a call in which the caller introduced himself as a wallet executive and asked him to download Any Desk app on his phone and share the code of the application. After sharing the code, money started getting deducted from his wallet and bank accounts,” said deputy commissioner of police (north) Sagar Singh Kalsi. The caller also made him download the app on his wife’s phone and transferred all the money available, Kalsi said. “They were duped of Rs 10 lakh.” Investigators found that while the suspects were from Jaipur, the money was withdrawn from various bank accounts in Jharkhand, West Bengal and Maharashtra, the DCP said. “Two police teams were simultaneously sent to Jaipur and Jharkhand. Pintu and Mukesh, who were arrested from a rented flat in Hastinapur Vistar, Jaipur, said Dular and Chetlal had gone to Jharkhand via Kolkata to collect the money. They were arrested from Giridih, Jharkhand,” Kalsi added. The suspects used to buy pre-activated SIMs of Orissa and West Bengal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/4-men-held-from-2-states-for-cyber-kyc-fraud/articleshow/89101748.cms||TNN
---||Delhi||Delhi: BJP, AAP in a war of words over Lokpal issue||NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party on Monday accused the Aam Aadmi Party government of “misleading” the people of Delhi on the issue of the Jan Lokpal Bill. Addressing a joint press conference, Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta and North-East Delhi MP Manoj Tiwari said the Delhi assembly had passed the Bill more than six years ago, but the AAP government was yet to take it to the logical conclusion. Reacting to the allegations, AAP in a statement said that BJP was playing politics over the issue of corruption by raising the issue of Lokpal when their own lieutenant governor rejected the proposal. “Replies to our RTI applications make it clear that the Delhi assembly passed the Bill in December 2015, but the file was sent to the LG office only on September 25, 2019. It was returned to the law department within two days,” Gupta claimed. He added that when BJP asked about the status of the Bill on December 29, 2015, the elected government claimed that it had been sent to the LG for his approval. “Where was the file lying for those four years and why did the AAP government lie?” Gupta asked. BJP MP Manoj Tiwari said that AAP had promised in 2013 to appoint Lokpal as soon as it formed the government but there has been no development even after eight years. AAP, however, said that BJP was playing politics over the issue of corruption. “They are only playing dirty politics by raising the issue of Lokpal when their own LG rejected the proposal. BJP is the most corrupt party in the history of independent India. They have no right to speak on corruption,” AAP said in the statement. The party said that the AAP government had eliminated corruption in 49 days. But when AAP formed the government again in 2015, BJP snatched away ACB (anti-corruption branch). “Why did the BJP’s central government take away ACB from the Delhi government? They didn’t even take a single step against corruption. We challenge them to return ACB to us and we will show how corruption can be completely eliminated,” the party stated.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/bjp-aap-in-a-war-of-words-over-lokpal-issue/articleshow/89101741.cms||---

A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh said it will take up the petitions on a “day-to-day” basis and asked the AAP government to address the issue. “We want to first deal with the issue of the constitution of town vending committees (TVCs) by Delhi government, which according to the petitioners was bad,” the court said. Besides the issue of the constitution of TVCs, the petitions have also raised a challenge to the validity of the Street Vendors Act, its implementation, certain provisions of the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Scheme, 2019 and other connected issues raised by various market associations and vendors and hawkers. When senior advocate Rahul Mehra, representing the Delhi government, wished to address submissions on the issue of the validity of the Act, the bench said it does not want to hear arguments on that as it has already heard the Centre’s counsel. “Justify constitution of TVCs first. Don’t forget you are here to assist us. You will assist us in the manner in which we want you to assist us. We are telling you to first advance arguments on the constitution of TVCs,” an irked bench made it clear to Mehra.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/hc-fast-tracks-hearing-on-street-vendors-act/articleshow/89101737.cms||---

Following reports of bull trawling within 2-3 nautical miles of Goa’s waters, a meeting was organised last week by Akhil Goa Kshatriya Pagi Community, former Canacona MLA Isidore Fernandes and fisheries department officials. Fernandes pulled up the fisheries department for not acting against Karnataka fishermen who are using bigger trawlers which is affecting the livelihood of local fishermen. This incident first occured on November 25 last year. “When our poor Pagi community are suffering, how can we sit quiet?” the former MLA said, and assured the fishermen that their problems will be redressed within eight days He said that the fisheries department should have intercepted the Karnataka fishermen trawlers who are violating the 12 nautical miles limit set for them for fishing.

Others who spoke and were present were Olencio Simoes, Janardhan Bhandari, Divakar Pagi, Ratnakar Dhuri, Anup Kurtarkar and others. During the incident in November last year, 25 high-speed big fishing boats were found fishing illegally in Goan territory near Talpona, and were intercepted by fisheries department personnel assisted by Coastal police under police Inspector Navlesh Desai.

The herd of bisons were first spotted by Michael Pereira and Ackroyd Fernandes who were proceeding to Chaudi. They immediately alerted the motorists and waited for nearly 20-25 minutes until the animals crossed the road. Pereira and Fernandes said that the bisons might have come to quench their thirst at Talpona river. There have been several reports of wild animals attacking pets in Canacona taluka. Ten days ago, a domesticated pig belonging to Peter Fernandes was lifted by a leopard. A year ago, a bison had damaged a moving vehicle by jumped on it. However, the driver escaped with minor injuries. Last year, TOI had reported that residents living near forested areas in the interiors of Canacona taluka had witnessed an increase in sightings of bison and bear, and hence locals fear attacks by animals.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/presence-of-bisons-alarms-motorists/articleshow/89125097.cms||---

The makers of our Constitution have gifted us with universal adult franchise. It is, therefore, the duty of every citizen to exercise this right to vote,” Pillai said. In his Republic Day message, Pillai said, “Goa is renowned for its communal harmony. People across religions have been living in unity, fraternity and solidarity. All festivals are equally respected and celebrated by all communities. The people of Goa have a tradition of peace and friendship. Let us resolve to preserve this unique cultural heritage of Goa.” While exhorting people to remain faithful to the Constitution in letter and spirit, he also said they must dedicate themselves to the realisation of a “self-sufficient, new India.” Pillai, in his address, honoured the Architect of the Indian Constitution, B R Ambedkar. “The nation is indebted to this iconic leader and I am sure the observance of this day will inspire the young generation to do great deeds for our nation. On this occasion we also remember the sufferings and sacrifices of the Indian Air Force, which has commendably safeguarded our country and maintained India’s unity and territorial integrity.” The governor also praised the country’s “remarkable vaccination achievement” amid the pandemic. “It is indeed commendable that we have been able to administer over 1.6 billion doses. These vaccines have been indigenously researched, developed and manufactured by our brilliant scientists and are a demonstration of fulfilling the call of Atmanirbhar Bharat. We have been able to show to the rest of the world that we are second to none in producing medicines and vaccines that met the world’s highest standards,” he said, even as he praised all the doctors, frontline staff and healthcare workers for their great service toward protecting the people during the pandemic.

Madkaikar said though he was contacted by other candidates for his support, including Elvis Gomes who is Congress’ Panaji candidate, he has decided to support Utpal and will campaign door to door for him. He was offered a ticket by TMC but he declined. “Luizinho Faleiro met me, AAP’s Valmiki Naik had also asked me to support him. My whole team and I will work for Utpal,” Madkaikar said. He said TMC had given him a very good offer and he had several rounds of meetings with its senior functionaries. The people who called, he said, requested him to back late Manohar Parrikar’s son. “If I were to contest on a TMC ticket, they said, there will be a division of votes. Their motto for backing Utpal is to defeat Babush (Atanasio Monserrate), and since I want the same, I decided to support Utpal,” he said. Meanwhile, former mayor Surendra Furtado said he would soon decide whether to support Utpal or not.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/ex-mayor-backs-utpal-to-defeat-monserrate/articleshow/89125108.cms||---
---||Delhi||AUD Go-Ahead To Entrance Exams For UG Admissions||New Delhi: In an academic council meeting held on Monday, Ambedkar University Delhi (AUD) gave its nod to conduct common entrance examinations for undergraduate admissions from the upcoming academic session. A committee was also constituted to finalise the modalities for implementation of the entrance tests. Undergraduate admissions at AUD are currently based on Class XII examination results while the varsity conducts entrances for postgraduate admissions. AUD vice-chancellor Anu Singh Lather told TOI, “The proposal to conduct entrance exams for undergraduate courses has been approved and a committee will be constituted to look into special requirements of programmes that are a little offbeat. The various schools will be given autonomy to decide what they want.” However, the university has not yet decided whether the CU-CET (Central Universities – Common Entrance Test), which is conducted by the National Testing Agency, will be implemented or some other entrance examination. “They will have to see how to design the same as each school will have its own requirement, so that will be discussed accordingly. For instance, the law school might want to subscribe to CLAT, while we would like to subscribe to CAT for MBA, but these would all depend on the deliberations,”Lather said. An academic council member further explained, “AUD offers various kinds of courses that might not match with the basket of courses that the national-level entrance will offer. While some courses might be similar to the ones being offered by the central universities, a few others might not be there. So the committee will be deliberating on these factors, especially on whether we will be a part of the national-level examination or a state-level one.” “The committee, which is likely to be notified in a day or two, will chart out modalities in a way that students do not face any problems. They have to appear for their board examinations and presenting multiple entrance examinations does not make sense. The idea is to provide a single window system for better ease. However, the variety of courses at AUD also needs to be taken into account,” the official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/aud-go-ahead-to-entrance-exams-for-ug-admissions/articleshow/89102406.cms||Shinjini Ghosh

This follows its latest Series-D fundraise of $72 million led by TCV (Technology Crossover Ventures). The round also saw participation from Darwinbox’s existing investors like Endiya Partners, Salesforce Ventures, Sequoia India, Lightspeed India, 3One4Capital, JGDEV and SCB 10X. This has taken its total funding to over $110 million so far. Darwinbox is the 84th startup from India to make it to this exclusive club that also includes newly minted unicorns like Analytics Saas (software as a service) player Fractal and Edtech startup LEAD School that made the cut in January this year. While in the past, a couple of Hyderabad born startups like Zenoti (spa & saloon management) and HighRadius (fintech) did join the unicorn club, this key milestone was achieved only after they shifted their headquarters to the US. Most Hyderabad startups move their HQs to other Indian cities such as Bengaluru or overseas to plug into the growth phase due to the lack of a mature venture capital ecosystem in the city. But Darwinbox's success has provided the breakthrough moment for Hyderabad's startup ecosystem, which has players such as VC player Endiya Partners led by Sateesh Andra that bet big on Darwinbox when it was taking baby steps and has been invested in each round since. Darwinbox was founded in 2015 by the Telugu trio of Chaitanya Peddi, an XLRI Jamshedpur alumnus, Jayant Paleti an IIT Madras and IIM Lucknow alumnus and Rohit Chennamaneni, who did his BTech from VIT and MBA from IIM Lucknow. The founders say the latest funding will “supercharge Darwinbox’s global expansion plan by allowing it to accelerate its platform innovation agenda, strengthen its product, engineering, and customer success teams along with scaling its go-to-market presence in South Asia, SEA, and MENA”. The company expects its overall team to grow by 100% and is also gearing up to foray into the US market later this year. “The company intends to use the funding in hiring senior-level talent to catapult it to the next stage of growth as well as in R&D to finetune its products to cater to new geographies such as US as well as in building its brand,” Darwinbox co-founder and product head, Chaitanya Peddi told TOI. The company is also eyeing inorganic growth opportunities through acquisition of startups that have complementary offerings, Peddi added. Currently, the startup has over 700 employees spread across 13 offices in India as well as South-East Asia and Middle East. “We may hire another 400-500 people in India and treble our headcount in South East Asia from the existing 80 people. Good talent comes at a cost, specially senior-level talent and this funding will be very useful,” he explained. Darwinbox, which has clocked a blistering growth of 200% since its last fundraise from Salesforce Ventures a year ago, has emerged as the youngest and only Asian origin player on Gartner’s Magic Quadrant for enterprise cloud HCM, which is considered the gold standard for any software, Peddi pointed out. “In addition, this year, we will be bolstering our platform offering with a host of ancillary services and solutions that enterprises can plug and play to compose an integrated HR tech ecosystem,” Peddi added. Pointing out that Darwinbox’s journey and milestone will inspire many more entrepreneurial ventures from Hyderabad, Sateesh Andra, managing director of Endiya Partners, said: “Today, Indian technology firms are competing and winning at a global level. When I first met Darwinbox six years ago, they were one of the very few SaaS technology firms to start in Hyderabad. Since then, we have come a long way. The highly passionate and experienced team led by three Telugu boys along with promising technology talent in the city made them the fastest growing start-up.” “Investing behind technology to manage talent has become inevitable for organizational success. Darwinbox’s demonstrated ability to build agile, innovative, and user-friendly solutions along with deep customer centricity has made them a platform of choice for several leading enterprises,” said Jessica Neal, former chief talent officer at Netflix, and a venture partner at TCV.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/darwinbox-evolves-into-hyds-1st-true-blue-unicorn/articleshow/89102767.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

But while institutes are shut for students due to the Covid third wave, DoE has asked schools to continue and to speed up the vaccination drive for students in the 15 to 18 age group. “Heads of all institutions shall endeavour to complete vaccination of children from 15 to 18 years of age as soon as possible,” the DoE has told all government, aided and unaided secondary and higher secondary schools. The directorate also has permitted schools to conduct practicals for science subjects during this period up to February 15. “As per directions of the state disaster management authority, the educational institutions in the state will remain closed till February 15, 2022. Students may be called in the school for science practical in staggered manner by following Covid appropriate behavior,” the circular reads. So far, around 80% children in the 15 to 18 age group have been administered first dose of Covid vaccine in Goa and the state health services will begin vaccinating students in the age group with second dose starting from January 31. Children are being vaccinated across 529 government, aided and private high and higher secondary schools in the state. Post vaccination, students are kept under observation for 30 minutes, after which they will be able to return to their routine. Schools have provided separate rooms to health services staff in the institute premises where the vaccination is undertaken.

On January 7, the industrial court had derecognized the ST union in response to a petition by Maharashtra State Transport Workers’ Congress (INTUC) in 2012 for violation of Maharashtra Recognition of Trade Unions & Prevention of Unfair Labour Laws Practices (MRTU & PULP) Act, 1971. State INTUC general secretary Mukesh Nigote said the MRTU & PULP Act deals with the regulation of industries in the country to attain the goal of empathy between employee and employer. “The ST union was not functioning in the interest of the employees but in the interest of the employer and the said recognition was granted under misrepresentation,” said Nigote. The INTUC allegations include that the ST union was a pro-employer and periodic settlement with MSRTC reduced the pay package of the employees, instead of increments. The ST union allowed the corporation to implement anti-employee policies whereby MSRTC created a junior pay-scale and junior employees had to work for five years on a consolidated pay, and there are several anomalies in their pay structure, the allegations go on to add. Responding to the ruling, the ST union stated that the industrial court order was bad in law and failed to appreciate the wage settlements between employees and MSRTC. It submitted that the union has a membership of over 41,000 employees amongst the workforce of 93,000 employees and “had always worked for the betterment of the employees”. The union also challenged the locus standi of INTUC. However, Nigote alleged that between 1996-2012, due to the recognized union’s lackadaisical approach, wages of MSRTC employees increased only by 17% while national wages of other state transport corporations increased by 40%.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/top-st-union-challenges-its-derecognition-in-hc/articleshow/89101648.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

Referring to suggestions sent by staff associations of over 20 colleges, DUTA members said that the feedback will be collated and a consolidated report will be sent to the varsity. DUTA president AK Bhagi said, “In the new structure, there will be a loss of academic content. So, a committee has been constituted to consolidate various suggestions and submit a report to the university. Drawbacks of the structure, its impact on teaching-learning process, among other aspects, will be looked into and formalised by the committee based on the feedback sent by staff association members.” The university had on Friday released a draft framework of undergraduate curriculum in line with the National Education Policy 2020, and asked stakeholders to put forth their suggestions by January 30. In the draft structure, the number of credits required for a four-year undergraduate programme has been reduced to 176, which is different from the 196 credit course structure that was passed by the varsity’s statutory bodies in August last year. Stating that the teachers’ body was one of the biggest stakeholders in the varsity, Bhagi added, “We are hoping that the university listens to us and accepts the recommendations. Writing to them and urging to consider it is our first step. If it does not accept it then we will have to resort to other modes to register our protest against the same.” Earlier, staff associations of several colleges had written to DUTA over a proposed change in the course structure, which has already been passedby the statutory bodies.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/duta-panel-to-give-feedback-on-new-framework/articleshow/89102432.cms||TNN
---||Delhi||Pipeline to take excess groundwater from GK-II to CR Park reservoir||New Delhi: To utilise the groundwater being extracted from six tubewells that started working in Greater Kailash II recently, Delhi Jal Board (DJB) has issued a tender for laying lines to supply the water to the reservoir in CR Park and mixing it with drinkable water. The work will be completed by March 31, an official said. “After laying the pipeline, we will be able to increase pumping of water for a longer duration and supply it through a new piped network. This will enable further reduction of groundwater at GK-II and feed the neighbouring areas,” said the official. The department has installed six piezometers to monitor the level of groundwater near six tubewells sometime ago as per the direction of Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) after residents of GK-II raised the issue of seepage of water into their basements in August 2020. The readings of piezometer taken on January 20 at South Delhi Municipal Corporation’s parks at GK-II stated that the water was available at the height of 3.2 metres at E-Block Udai Shankar Park, 4.6m at the park opposite M Block market, and 2.7m at the park in front of E Block Sehgal Market-I, said a resident. Among the other parks, water was found at 12.4m at E Block Sehgal Market-II, 9.8m in M Block park and 9.2m opposite S-21. “As per the readings, the most affected area is between Gurudwara Road and some parts of M Block adjoining E-Block Sehgal-I side. Extracted water is now fed into the water supply system of GK-II and being pumped for only seven hours from 9am to 4pm,” said GK-II Residents Welfare Association president Sanjay Rana. “We requested for an alternative solution to further reduction of groundwater levels and thankfully DJB started work on the pipeline project,” he said, adding that they had shared the piezometre readings with CGWB.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/pipeline-to-take-excess-groundwater-from-gk-ii-to-cr-park-reservoir/articleshow/89101782.cms||Vibha Sharma

Telangana’s irrigation officials have said the project components that exclusively serve their territory and drawal already monitored at canal head works should be excluded from the gazette notification issued by the Ministry of Jal Shakti. GRMB’s sixth sub-committee meeting was held on Monday mainly to finalise the handing over notes of Medigadda barrage with Kannepally from Telangana and old Venkatanagaram pumping scheme. The meeting was chaired by GRMB member secretary B P Panday and attended by sub-committee member Sridhar Rao Deshpande and Telangana irrigation officials Subramany Prasad . From AP, chief engineer of Godavari Delta System Pulla Rao and other officials were present. Telangana officials argued that they informed GRMB earlier that they were ready to hand over only Peddavagu medium irrigation project on Godavari and project components listed under schedule 2 of the gazette notification and the rest were not common projects. “We have refuted AP’s demand on taking over projects of Telangana on Godavari basin that were providing waters to unserved areas of Krishna basin. The diversions by the state were well within its dependable share entitled and within the ambit of GWDT award and does not attract the KWDT awards by any stretch of imagination. This was conveyed in earlier board meetings also,” a Telangana irrigation official, who attended the meeting said. Even with respect of Peddavagu project, the sub-committee held a detailed discussion and finalised hand over notes. officials said KRMB has been involving members of sub-committees during site visits and in the preparation of handing over notes, but the GRMB cannot act contrary to that stand. “During the 5th sub-committee meeting of GRMB on 17.11.2021, Telangana said the Board secretariat cannot unilaterally conduct project site visits without involvement of a member of the sub-committee in such visits and that any project report or handing over notes prepared without involvement of sub-committee member. We are reiterating the same view,’ Telangana officials said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/take-over-only-common-projects-t-tells-grmb/articleshow/89102795.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Hyderabad||Telangana CM K Chandrasekhar Rao slams changes to IAS rules, writes to PM Narendra Modi||HYDERABAD: Registering a strong protest against the proposed amendments to the All India Service (AIS) cadre rules on Central deputation of officers by the Centre, Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao said the amendments were against the federal spirit of the Constitution, both in letter and spirit and strain the Centre and state relationship. The CM in his letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday asked the Union government to desist from the proposed amendments in the interest of administrative fairness. The Centre has recently proposed to amend Rule 6 (deputation of cadre officers) of the Indian Administrative Service Rules 1954. With this, the Centre need not take the state government’s consent to send an AIS officer on central deputation. The Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) wrote to all the states seeking their opinion on this before January 28. Several state CMs were opposing the Centre’s proposal on deputations. “The proposed amendment to the AIS cadre rules is nothing but amending the Constitution of India relating to the Centre-state relations. Instead of such a backdoor method of amending the AIS service rules, it should muster courage to amend the provisions by the Parliament,” KCR said. While terming it as a dangerous move (amendment), which is against the constitutional framework and spirit of cooperative federalism, KCR said if the proposed amendments are affected by the Centre, the state would be reduced to an insignificant entity. The CM said the proposal was aimed at indirect control by the Centre on the officers working in the states and also amounts to interfering in the functioning of the state government. “This is also targeted harassment of officers and their demoralization besides impacting accountability of officers to the state governments. The state government would become helpless entities in AIS officers’ matters,” KCR said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/kcr-slams-changes-to-ias-rules-writes-to-pm/articleshow/89102796.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Hyderabad||G Kishan Reddy blames Telangana govt for delay in railway projects||HYDERABAD: Union tourism minister G Kishan Reddy wrote a letter to Telangana CM K Chandrasekhar Rao stating several rail projects were getting delayed in Telangana due to ‘lack of cooperation from the state government’ as he termed it. Kishan Reddy said there was laxity on the part of the state government even pertaining to the MMTS phase-2 project. He explained the state had contributed only 129 cr when its share was 760 cr. Though the railway board had agreed to extend the MMTS connecting under phase-2 to Yadadri at the request of the state government, the project could not take off as it was yet to contribute its share of two-third cost, the minister, who represents Secunderabad in the Lok Sabha, said. In the letter written on Monday, he said TRS leaders have been alleging that the Centre was not releasing funds for railway projects in the state. “The fact is the state government itself is not releasing its due share of funds and not completing land acquisition for rail projects,” he said. Kishan Reddy said in the last seven year under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s rule, the allocations for rail projects by the Centre had increased by nine times. He pointed out that while the budget allocated was 250 cr for rail projects in Telangana during 2014-15, the allocation was 2,420 cr in 2020-21. The increase in railway network was 194 route kilometres. “If only the state contributed its share and completed land acquisition, there would have been far greater progress,” he said. The Union minister cited examples where the state government had not discharged its responsibility. “For the Manoharabad-Kothapalli new railway line of 151 km, the state government is to bear one-third of the cost and provide land, but 100 cr is still due from the government and 342 hectares of land has not been handed over for development of the railway line,” he said. While 54 road over bridges have been sanctioned for Telangana, in many cases, he alleged that there was not enough cooperation being received from Telangana with regard to drawing approvals and other technical matters.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/kishan-blames-t-govt-for-delay-in-railway-projects/articleshow/89102797.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

A single judge of the high court reserved his orders in her plea urging the court to quash the case against her filed by the CBI. She contended that if the trial court goes ahead, hearing the discharge petitions and framing charges against the accused even before the HC pronounces its decision on the same subject, it would result in the miscarriage of justice and would cause irreparable injury and grave prejudice against her. She also mentioned in her petition that the trial court, upon objections from CBI, had dismissed her plea to put forward the new developments before the CBI court.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/ias-officer-srilakshmi-moves-t-hc/articleshow/89102801.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Lineages Behind Surge Among Vaxxed||HYDERABAD: Coronavirus’ Delta variant and its sub-lineages were responsible for vaccine breakthrough infections in Hyderabad and other parts of Telangana through the second wave of Covid-19, reveals a study by a team of city researchers. Vaccine breakthrough infections were observed in people vaccinated by either Covishield or Covaxin. The study, involving genome-wide analysis by Asmita Gupta, Reelina Basu and Murali Dharan Bashyam of the laboratory of molecular oncology, Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD), revealed that there was a sudden change in the landscape of the nucleotide variations (NV) of the novel coronavirus coinciding with the second wave. The study also revealed that the Delta sub-lineages were marked by presence of several NVs over and above those that defined the Delta. Also, Delta sub-lineages like AY.20 and AY.39 had relatively higher numbers of NVs compared to other sub-lineages observed in Telangana.  The study was published in preprint server MedRxiv recently. “A large fraction (70%) of vaccination breakthrough cases belonged to the Delta lineage, followed by (sub-lineages) AY.44 (5.2%), AY.20, AY.43, and AY.39 (5% each). Interestingly, 57%, 39%, 29%, and 22% of all samples classified as AY.32, AY.43, AY.35, and AY.20 respectively, belonged to vaccination breakthrough cases,” the researchers said. The genome-wide analysis also gave an insight into the novel coronavirus variants and their sub-lineages that were in circulation in Hyderabad and Telangana during the second wave of Covid-19. It revealed that there were several nucleotide variations completely mutually exclusive with those associated with previously circulating lineages. There was also a preferential co-occurrence of specific nucleotide variations in Delta sub-lineages but absent from Delta itself. The study suggested a higher enrichment of certain co-occurring nucleotide variations in vaccination breakthrough (compared to other) cases. As part of the study, the team had analysed the whole genome sequence of 3,543 Covid-19 samples from Telangana collected between April 2020 and October 2021. “The dataset included 313 vaccination breakthrough cases, of which 244 belonged to Telangana. Of these, 154 were completely vaccinated, 149 had received only one vaccination dose, while the status of 10 was unavailable,” the researchers said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/lineages-behind-surge-among-vaxxed/articleshow/89102802.cms||Syed Akbar
---||Hyderabad||Will bring central Act to rein in hospitals: T to HC||HYDERABAD: The Telangana government on Monday informed the high court that it will soon put in place the Centre’s stringent Clinical Establishments Act replacing the state Act. The HC gave state four weeks to implement it after its counsel sought time to frame the rules. The central Act of 2010 is aimed at regulating treatment costs at private hospitals and would replace the Telangana Allopathic Private medical care Establishments Act (registration and regulation) Act, 2002. The Centre had given states the option to adopt the central law or follow their existing state laws. In 2017, both the Telangana assembly and council passed resolutions to bring in the central Act. The direction from a bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Abhinand Kumar Shavili on Monday came while hearing a PIL by Vijay Gopal, president of Forum Against Corruption, accusing the state of inaction in protecting people from exploitative corporate hospitals. However, state counsel Sanjeev Kumar pointed out that the Centre was yet to form the competent authority to fix charges for hospital services. “We adopted the central law because there was no conflict with state law. It is true there was some delay in making the rules. But at the same time it should be noted that a competent authority has to be formed by the central government to fix charges for various hospital services in consultation with the states. Till now, the Centre has not yet formed that authority,” Sanjeev told TOI. The petitioner had contended that there was a huge public uproar during the pandemic over exorbitant charges by private hospitals and the state, despite its promises, had not brought in the central Act. “Though the state adopted this central Act on March 25, 2017, it has not equipped the law with the required rules to implement it in the state,” the petitioner said. He sought the immediate constitution of a grievance redressal facility in line with the provisions of the central Act, both at the state and district levels. Petitioner’s counsel V Siddhartha Goud said, “There are allegations that the state has not informed the Centre about adoption of the central law till now. Its RTI replies are not showing Telangana in the list of states that adopted the central Act.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/will-bring-central-act-to-rein-in-hospitals-t-to-hc/articleshow/89102803.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

Patients are complaining of having long-lasting symptoms such as fatigue, dry cough, body ache even after ‘recovery’. “I tested negative for Covid-19 a few days ago, yet I feel very weak and have a dry cough. I am unable to resume work and carry out day to day activities,” said Vidya Dev, a resident of Madhapur. In most cases, people suffering from Omicron are recovering within five to seven days. Some of those who have recovered are also complaining of persistent headache, joint pain, sleep disturbance, concentration difficulties, among other issues. Doctors fear that even mild cases of Covid-19 can trigger ‘long Covid-19’, which means long lasting residual symptoms of the virus. “In addition to weakness and dry cough, there are a lot of patients that are complaining of persistent gastrointestinal symptoms, occasional lose motions, cramps in the abdomen, loss of appetite. These are side-effects of the virus,” said Dr Sanjeev Singh, a proctologist, who is also the national secretary for the Indian Medical Association’s Academy of Medical Specialities. In some cases, doctors have observed neurological symptoms post-recovery. “Lot of people are complaining of brain fog syndrome, insomnia, anxiety, forgetfulness and are not as swift in completing tasks due to enormous fatigue. The new variant enters the spinal fluid and crawls up to the brain, resulting in an inflammatory response, which is a lingering effect,” said Dr Guru N Reddy, chairman and managing director of Continental Hospitals. Doctors have advised people to be careful as complications from Omicron are yet to be ascertained.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/omicron-patients-suffering-long-lasting-symptoms/articleshow/89102804.cms||Preeti Biswas

Official sources said that there are only six international passengers out of 75 patients, who are currently admitted for Covid treatment in TIMS. Since Omicron-variant emerged in the state, TIMS happens to be the only state-run hospital providing treatment for international passengers coming in from ‘at-risk’ countries. Officials point out that most of the Omicron cases that came for treatment, happen to be youngsters with mild symptoms. However, there are a lot of patients with co-morbidities. Officials said that there is a surge in admissions across all wards and four patients are currently getting treated at the ICU. “Previously it was around 65 admissions and now it has risen to 75. The figures change by the end of the day,” TIMS superintendent Dr Ehsan Ahmed Khan said. On the other hand, there is a surge in people seeking patient services. On average around 70 to 80 patients are coming every day including people testing positive for Covid and regular seasonal flu.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/tims-sees-decline-in-intl-ve-patients/articleshow/89102809.cms||---

Amid surge in Covid-19 cases, doctors across the city have advised people to not panic and not to consult multiple doctors at once. “I have got cases where people have taken the booster dose and yet consulted doctors in multiple hospitals just to be sure. Some are landing up at private hospitals for monoclonal therapy after consulting multiple doctors at once. It is not required as one can simply consult a doctor who is specialised into the area of concern,” said Dr K Shankar, superintendent of Fever Hospital, Nallakunta. From prescribing symptomatic medicines to antibiotics among series of tests, different doctors are recommending different line of treatments for Covid-19 patients resulting in massive confusion. Doctors have advised people to rather stick to a healthcare professional who is aware of your health history and can guide you in the right direction. In many cases, doctors say that patients are panicking and landing at hospitals for not so serious conditions. Doctors have also advised against self-medication as it may lead to other complications.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/dont-consult-multiple-docs-say-experts/articleshow/89102811.cms||---

He was speaking after laying the foundation stone of package-II of ‘Outer Ring Road Phase-II’ water supply scheme at Alkapur township in Manikonda, that will see new water lines and service reservoirs built as part of it. As much as Rs 587 crore has been earmarked for completion of the water supply scheme. For the entire ORR Phase-II project, the government has allocated Rs 1,200 crore. KTR said the project will benefit close to six lakh people living in 978 gated communities and colonies. At present 600 million gallons of water per day (MGD) is supplied to meet the demand of Greater Hyderabad, the minister said the city will receive 1,000 MGD by 2051. “To make this happen, works pertaining to Sunkishala — tapping of Krishna water — is on in full swing. We are spending Rs 1,400 crore for it,” he said. About two years ago, residents of Alkapur township held protests to air their water woes. Addressing a public meeting at Alkapur, KTR said, “The Centre is implementing our schemes across the country and ‘Har Ghar Ko Jal’ is one such scheme that has been modelled on the Telangana government’s ‘Mission Bhagiratha’. My government and its schemes have become a role model for the country.” He added: “Once upon a time, it was said that what what Bengal does today India does tomorrow, now the concept is what Telangana does today, India does tomorrow. The Rythu Bandhu is one such an example that the Centre is implementing in 11 states as PM Kisan scheme.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/city-will-be-getting-1k-mgdwater-by-2051-says-ktr/articleshow/89102814.cms||Sunil Mungara
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Investment frauds rife as profit lure tempts many||HYDERABAD: Investment fraud is becoming rampant in the city, and on an average every day two cases are being registered despite police crackdown and awareness drives. Fraudsters are duping victims on the pretext of offering exorbitant profits for paltry investments. In one such example, in the second week of January, P Brahmananda Reddy, 41, a private employee from Chevella, lodged a complaint with Cyberabad police stating that he and 17 others including friends and family members lost 8.73 lakh to fraudsters who lured him into investing in bogus schemes offering an exorbitant interest. Reddy told police that he came across Lime O2O app. When he clicked on a link received through SMS, he was directed to a telegram group where he was given various investment options including 20 per day for 70 days with 500 investment and 750 per day for 90 days with 15,000 investment. As he received interest promptly for a few days, Reddy made 17 others invest through the app as the fraudsters offered him 12% commission on each new investment made through his reference. “After we invested 8.73 lakh, the fraudster who went by the name ‘Seema Trivedi’, stopped communicating,” the complainant told police. In another complaint, V Chandra Shanker Reddy, 31, an engineering graduate from Shamirpet, approached police saying that he received a message on WhatsApp in the last week of December 2021 mentioning that a software firm is looking to recruit part-time and full time workers with 800 to 13,000 daily salary. When Shankar clicked on the link in the message, a webpage opened where he was asked to register and complete tasks like clicking on various items and answering various questions. Once the tasks were completed, the wallet on the webpage showed that there was 300 balance for withdrawal. He later accumulated much more. The money he made was only visible in the e-wallet of the app. He was unable to withdraw it. When he asked the reason, the fraudster asked him to transfer certain amount to get access to withdraw the money from e-wallet. He then sent 2.58 lakh (not at one go) and lost that amount. “We arrested several fraudsters including Chinese nationals involved in the investment fraud. We are working on the latest cases too. On an average, we are getting two to three complaints every day in the city,” said a senior cyber crime officer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/investment-frauds-rife-as-profit-lure-tempts-many/articleshow/89102815.cms||---

The accused also injured his sister when she tried to intervene. The accused was identified as Sudheer Kumar, 25, a graduate. Victim was Konda Papamma. According to police, Papamma along with her daughter Suchitra and Sudheer has been living in Ramkote. “Papamma, a widow, used to work as a labourer. Sudheer completed graduation and worked as a driver for a while. Currently, he is unemployed due to mental health issues,” assistant commissioner of police (ACP), Sultan Bazar, P Devender said. Around 2.30am on Monday, Papamma noticed that Sudheer was working out in the house and told him to sleep. “Papamma told Sudheer that it was not the right time to exercise and advised him to sleep. Sudheer picked up a dumb-bell and attacked Papamma on the head. With severe injuries, she died on the spot,” Sultan Bazar inspector D Bhikshapathi said. Suchitra tried to intervene and save her mother, but Sudheer hit her too with the dumb-bell and pushed her away. Alerted by neighbours, night duty police personnel immediately rushed to the spot and shifted the body of Papamma for post-mortem examination to Osmania General Hospital. Suchitra was also admitted to hospital for treatment. “Suchitra also sustained a head injury, but she is out of danger,” the inspector said. Police apprehended Sudheer, who assaulted and bit some locals when they tried to control him. “We shifted Sudheer to Institute of Mental Health at Erragadda. A case was registered against him under Sections 302 and 307 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC),” assistant commissioner of police (ACP), Sultan Bazar, P Devender said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/mom-asks-youth-not-to-work-out-he-kills-her-with-dumb-bell/articleshow/89102820.cms||---

The two major parties, Congress and BJP, have released their list of candidates for the upcoming assembly polls on 64 and 59 assembly seats, respectively. While the ruling party did not field a single Muslim candidate, Congress has fielded just two. The low representation has been pointed out by many, since, according to the Census 2011, Muslim population in Uttarakhand is 14%. “It is unfortunate that secular parties did not give due representation in ticket distribution. Muslims enjoy a decent presence in at least 23 seats and have a heavy presence in nine seats of the plain districts. We will field our own candidates in Muslim-populated seats to teach these secular parties a lesson,” said Naeem Qureshi, president of Muslim Seva Sangathan. “We had a meeting with our party leadership. The BJP will get Muslim votes since they have benefitted from the schemes initiated by PM Modi. We are hoping that BJP will field a Muslim candidate from Piran Kaliyar seat since the ticket of the other minority-dominated seat (Manglaur) was given to Dinesh Pawar,” said Shadab Shams, BJP member and deputy chairman of 15-point programme implementation panel under the state minority welfare department. “We have given three tickets out of 64 to the minority community. We wanted to field six candidates from the minority community which we hope will be realised when the candidates for the remaining 6 seats are announced. A senior Muslim leader from Kiccha seat has refused to contest. So, that seat went to Tilak Raj Behar,” said Tahir Ali, president of the minority-wing of the Congress in Uttarakhand.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/ticket-distribution-muslim-groups-point-out-low-representation/articleshow/89100661.cms||Mohammad Anab

In a letter to the Union finance minister, he said the Centre had not released backward areas development fund for 2019-20 and current year, which comes to about 900 crore. He said 14th finance commission grants to local bodies amounting to 817 crore were also denied without any specific reason. Rao said a special grant of 723 crore was recommended by 15th finance commission for 2020-2021 as tax devolution for state. Grants recommended by finance commission were never denied in the past, he said. Even the Centre’s share on centrally sponsored schemes being implemented by Telangana for the first year (2014-15) was not released, he said. “The entire share of Centre was released to AP by oversight though it was apportioned in the ratio of population between AP and Telangana. The share of Telangana wrongly released to AP amounts to 495 crore. Though the matter was taken up, it is yet to be adjusted to Telangana. It should be released on priority basis,” Rao said. He also requested release of IGST settlement of about Rs 210 crore.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/release-3k-cr-grants-harish-to-fm/articleshow/89102832.cms||Koride Mahesh

---||Kolkata||Covid-19: Favour reopening of campuses in a phased manner, says Bengal minister Bratya Basu||Poulami.Roy KOLKATA: Bengal is likely to reopen educational institutions in a phased manner, education minister Bratya Basu said on Monday. Schools (classes IX to XII), colleges and universities were closed for on-campus classes on January 3, during the beginning of the third wave, a month-and-a-half after they had reopened on November 16. “Chief minister Mamata Banerjee is concerned about the matter. We want to reopen schools step-by-step,” Basu said, when asked about a possible time-frame. “The CM is herself in favour of reopening, but we are looking for a long-term solution so that we do not have to shut everything down again immediately after reopening. The CM will announce the decision after weighing in all these factors.” The state, Basu added, was in favour of reopening schools, “but not at the risk of the lives of the students,” he added. Around 27.7 lakh teenagers in the 15-18 age-group have been vaccinated in Bengal. TOI had reported on Saturday that the education department had started planning for the reopening of educational institutions, and had even held a preliminary discussion with senior state officials at Nabanna the previous day. The education department, sources said, is gearing up to reopen institutions within a week of getting a go-ahead. The authorities have received feedback from various quarters that board students need to get at least one month’s physical classes before the final exams start from March.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/favour-reopening-of-campuses-in-a-phased-manner-bratya/articleshow/89102836.cms||---

Several hospitals have introduced day-care packages for the treatment and a number of claims for these have been registered with TPAs in the last fortnight. Cocktail therapy has been removed from essential Covid treatment protocol in Bengal. But hospitals continue to use it, especially on elderly patients with comorbidities. On January 7, the IRDA had issued a circular advising insurance companies not to reject cocktail therapy claims “under the pretext that it is an experimental treatment”. Sujay Mitra, assistant manager at National Insurance and a part of its medical team, said in the last few days the company had received multiple queries from both retail and corporate customers on antibody cocktail therapy. “We have received and settled some claims as well. But we think more claims will be made in the next 10-15 days as some claims were rejected prior to the IRDA advisory. It will take some more days to correctly assess the number of such claims,” he said. As per established norms, reimbursement claims can be filed within 30 days of hospitalisation. Mitra said since antibody cocktail treatment was mostly being administered in day-care packages, people were generally opting for reimbursement over cashless facility, which takes more time. “We’ll now admit cashless claims too for cocktail therapy, but some people may prefer reimbursement because the amount is low,” he added. Jyotirmay Kundu of Heritage TPA said there was no clarity on the therapy till the first week of January but after the IRDA circular, there has been 200% jump in claims and over 500% jump in queries about the therapy. "We have settled some claims," he said. C Bera, branch manager of Raksha TPA in Kolkata, said they too have settled some claims for antibody cocktail treatment but mostly from corporate customers and so the numbers were not that high. Bhaskar Nerurkar, head of health claims at Bajaj Allianz General Insurance said they too were "supporting the method" and added that Covid claims, which had surged in the first two weeks of January in Kolkata, were now coming down. Sanjay Datta, chief, underwriting and claims, ICICI Lombard said the company had received around 100 Covid intimations under cashless mode in the last 20 days from eastern India, of which 80%-90% were from Kolkata. Alok Roy, chairman of Medica, said it had offered the therapy to many but now the numbers were coming down. Rupak Barua, group CEO of AMRI said response to the therapy in day-care was good.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/not-in-cov-protocol-but-cocktail-therapy-claims-flood-insurers/articleshow/89102837.cms||Udit Prasanna Mukherji
---||Kolkata||‘Blast’ at wedding venue in Kolkata, security staffer dead||Mayukh Sengupta KOLKATA: A member of the security staff died and two were critically injured after the security room on the compound of a luxury hotel in Baguihati collapsed into the underground water reservoir after a deafening explosion and a fire a little after 7pm on Monday. Police and fire brigade sources said there was a wedding reception at hotel Celesta on the arterial VIP Road when the incident occurred, but no one from the wedding party was injured, as the main building was not affected. Police sources said it appeared that the concrete slabs over the underground water reservoir had collapsed. This water reservoir is the emergency reservoir which is used to tackle fires, said an officer, adding, “One possible reason for the accident is an explosion in the pump in the reservoir. When this collapsed, this brought down the security room. Over the security room was an electrical panel, which also collapsed, causing a short circuit and the fire.” Witnesses claimed there were at least three security personnel in the room when it collapsed. It is too early to say for certain what exactly happened. "Forensic experts are at the spot, trying to ascertain the reason. Our first job now is to clear the debris and look out for survivors. There were around three people in the security room when it collapsed. Two have been rescued and sent to the hospital in a very critical condition," said an officer. Till reports last came in, disaster personnel were trying to cut through the concrete slabs to clear the rubble and search for possible survivors. While two persons were found initially, a third man, Chandra Sekhar Bera (38), who was brought out by fire brigade after three-and-a-half hours, later died. He was a security staffer and resident of East Midnapore. "The search operations will continue until the rubble is cleared," an officer said. The cops said the wedding invitee on the main hotel building's seventh floor was prevented from getting hurt because the guards reacted quickly and followed fire safety protocols. Father of the bride Saktipada Sau, who had arrived from Kharagpur, said, "The ceremony had just about started. It was 7 or 7.15pm. All we heard was an explosion and the power snapped. The guards were alert and prompt. They escorted us out through the fire escape. Had they not acted on time, it would have been disastrous."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/blast-at-wedding-venue-security-staffer-dead/articleshow/89102787.cms||---

What happened to that? The state had allocated Rs 100 crore for such construction in the state budget,” Ghosh said.Roy said the Bengal government had declassified all Netaji files with it. “What did the Centre do?” he asked.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/netaji-legacy-bjp-tmc-war-of-words-on/articleshow/89102838.cms||---

The ratio between secured and unsecured credit is also reducing fast. Currently, the bank has a ratio of 40:60 between secured and unsecured credit. Ghosh has set a target of 50:50 in the near future. “Now micro credit encompasses around 52% of our portfolio. The target was to bring it down to 30% by 2025 and we shall achieve that,” he added.The Bandhan Bank MD is also bullish on the home loan portfolio, which is one of its focus areas these days following its acquisition of Gruh Finance from HDFC Ltd. It now has a home loan portfolio of Rs 20,939 crore. “The segment is now 24% of our business which can go up to 30%,” he added.He also said that for the EEB segment (erstwhile micro-banking segment), collection efficiency for December, 2021, stood at 92% (including NPAs) against 86% in September, 2021. “And, it was 97% (excluding NPAs) for December versus 93% in September 2021.”“We have seen an all-round recovery during the quarter with improved collection and increase in disbursement. Q4 historically has been the best quarter for the bank and we are positive of our business going forward. With group loan share in total advances reduced to 52%, the bank is on track to achieve the diversification strategy, which it had laid down for FY25,” Ghosh said.The bank said the share of full paying customers now stood at 89% in December 2021, up from 79% in September 2021. Around 66% of NPA customers continued to make payments in a bid to regularise their overdue loan accounts at the earliest. Around 2/3rd of the bank’s restructured customers continued to pay despite the moratorium.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/bandhan-bank-on-target-to-cut-dependence-on-microfin/articleshow/89102839.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Covid-19: Panel orders hospitals in West Bengal to pass on discounts on cash payments||KOLKATA: The West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission (WBCERC) will issue an order, asking all private hospitals to file an affidavit, along with a bond, saying it would abide by the commission’s advisory on offering discount on medicines, consumables and pathological tests to patients paying their bills in cash. Even if the patient gets a part of the treatment cost from insurance, hospitals are to offer a proportionate discount on the amount paid in cash. The decision to issue the order was taken following complaints of violations of the commission’s advisory on discounts, said officials. “It will take about a week to finalize it. Once done, it will be shared with all private hospitals, mandating them to file affidavits and submit bonds on complying with our advisory,” said said Justice (retd) Ashim Kumar Banerjee, chairman of WBCERC. The commission in August 2020 had asked private hospitals to offer a discount of 10% on medicines and 20% on consumables , apart from capping the rates for tests, doctors’ fees and PPE. The commission clarified these discounts were meant for cash patients, Covid and non-Covid, and will exclude the amount received from insurance companies, if any. The commission recently received a complaint from a patient from Silchar admitted to Medica Superspecialty Hospital with Crohn’s disease complications. After he died, the daughter, Anwesha Dutta, filed a complaint to the commission, related to the treatment. The panel found the hospital had violated its advisory on discounts. While Dutta was advised to approach the state medical council for the treatment part, the health panel scrutinised the bill. The panel said of the Rs 14 lakh charged by the hospital, the insurance company had paid Rs 3 lakh and the rest Rs 11 lakh had to be paid by the patient’s family. “Despite reminders that all cash patients should get entitlement of our advisory on discounts and insured patients on the portion of the bill they have to bear, we find many hospitals violating it. In this particular case, no discount was offered...” the panel said. The commission has asked Medica to revise the bill. “We have not yet received a copy of the order on discounts or any direction in this case. We will take appropriate steps once we receive them,” said Medica chairperson Alok Roy.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/panel-orders-hosps-to-pass-on-discounts-on-cash-payments/articleshow/89102841.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kolkata||Covid-19: Colleges, universities take infrastructure stock amid reopening talk||KOLKATA: Colleges and universities have again started taking stock of their preparedness to hold in-person classes as education department considers the idea of reopening campuses in a staggered manner. The institutes have not yet received any go ahead from the education department to reopen campuses, but the authorities want to be ready with students’ vaccination status, infrastructure for hybrid classes and implementation of safety guidelines. In many colleges, authorities have also started preparing the list of semesters that need to be called in first, depending on their seniority, their need for lab work and examinations. “We have not yet received any nod from the education department, but we want to be prepared from our end so that college can be opened as soon as the government decides,” said Tapan Kumar Poddar, principal at Vivekananda College and president of Calcutta University chapter of All Bengal Principals’ Council. The state government shut down campuses of all educational institutes earlier this month as a precautionary measure against the third wave of the pandemic. But last week, the education department gave indications that the government might be considering the idea of reopening campuses in a staggered manner, following safety guidelines. “Before any decision is taken on resuming in-person classes, we will seek a report from colleges and universities and status of their preparedness,” said an education department official. Many colleges have started collecting vaccination details of their students and their staff. “We found that several students have skipped their second dose. We are telling them to complete it at the earliest,” said the principal of a central Kolkata college. Several colleges are ramping up their digital infrastructure further. “We plan to call students in small batches. So, it is important we have proper infrastructure for hybrid classes,” said another principal. Administrative wings of most colleges are open as non-academic activities are underway. Teachers, too, are visiting the campuses to upload semester examination marks on the university portal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/colleges-univs-take-infra-stock-amid-reopening-talk/articleshow/89102842.cms||Zeeshan Javed

---||Kolkata||Cal HC dismisses Netaji plea, says petitioner ‘late’||Kolkata: Calcutta High Court on Monday dismissed a public interest litigation seeking the court’s intervention on the Centre’s rejection of the Netaji tableau from Bengal sent for the Republic Day parade in New Delhi.A division bench of Chief Justice Prakash Shrivastava and Justice Rajarshi Bharadwaj, while dismissing the plea by lawyer Rama Prasad Sarkar, observed that the petitioner had “belatedly” approached the court. “As the Republic Day celebration is day after tomorrow (Wednesday), therefore, at this stage, no effective direction can be issued,” it observed.Sarkar had filed the PIL last Thursday.Additional solicitor general Y J Dastoor submitted that unlike earlier governments, the present government at the Centre showcased Netaji as an icon and recognized his contribution in hastening the process of Independence.The Centre had announced Netaji’s birthday on January 23 as “Parakram Diwas” and R-Day celebrations have kicked off from January 23 this year as a mark of respect to his 125th birth anniversary, he said. Dastoor also pointed out that a hologram statue of Netaji had been installed under the canopy of India Gate that would be replaced by a statue in August.The additional solicitor general contended that Bengal’s tableau was rejected this year as per rules, and he could furnish the reasons before the court if the state wanted. Bengal advocate general S N Mookherjee submitted that the reasons for rejection have not been communicated to the state government yet.Dastoor also argued that the PIL was not maintainable because there was no demand for justice in the petition.The bench observed: “…we have noticed that apart from the various defects pointed out by the additional solicitor general in the petition and facts disclosed by him, the petitioner has belatedly approached the court.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/cal-hc-dismisses-netaji-plea-says-petitioner-late/articleshow/89102845.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Covid-19: Citizens in Kolkata get back green space after three weeks||Basabdatta Sarkar & Amit Moulik KOLKATA: More people turned out on a murky Monday morning at Rabindra Sarobar and Subhas Sarobar when restrictions imposed in the wake of the third wave were eased for three hours than they had in bright and sunny mornings post the first wave in June 2020 and the second wave exactly a year later. “The turnout was lower than usual on a winter morning. But it was definitely a lot better than the few who had turned up when the lake had reopened last year and the year before. Also, everyone who turned up was masked up,” said Sangita Dey, a resident of Lake Road who works as a marketing research consultant and has been a regular at the Dhakuria lake for a decade and a half. While the fear of the unknown had kept many citizens away in 2020, the double dose mandate for entry after the second wave led to the low turnout then. On Monday though, neither fear nor vaccination was an issue. With most citizens now fully vaccinated and some even administered the booster dose, people were relieved to be back at the lake. While Dey used to walk along Southern Avenue during the three-week shutdown, businessman Gautam Guchhait had stopped exercising altogether. “Some sections of the pavement are encroached upon, there is dog poop everywhere. One is often forced to walk on the road and that is hazardous. I don’t know why the lake was shut in the first place but I am glad it has reopened and we can exercise now,” he said. Across the city at Subhas Sarobar in Beliaghata off EM Bypass, advocate Biswanath Bhowmick who lives on Rajamohan Dutta Garden Lane also wondered what prompts the closure of lakes and parks when they are open-to-air venues where chance of infection is much less than air-conditioned closed spaces that have continued to function. “When people walk and exercise, they stay fit. And that is important to combat diseases. I hope we have seen the last of closures for parks and lakes. I look forward to them staying open for extended hours so that there is no crowding,” he said. Physician Kallol Banerjee, who was among several dozen citizens who had written an open letter to CM Mamata Banerjee, urging her to step in and open parks and lakes, thanked the administration for responding. But he too said it would have been nice if these green open spaces had stayed open till late evening so that people could choose the time to exercise as per their convenience. “Parks and lakes make a difference to people’s physical and mental health. People get rejuvenated just being close to nature. Seeing others exercise is also inspiring. During the pandemic, when children and senior citizens are cooped up at home, parks mean breaking the shackles and hope for a brighter future,” he pointed out. For Keya Chatterjee, a resident of Charu Market, the opening of Rabindra Sarobar meant a reunion with friends who practice yoga there. “I was missing everyone. The yoga sessions we have together are so uplifting. It was great to be back,” said Chatterjee.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/citizens-get-back-green-space-after-three-weeks/articleshow/89102846.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Duare classroom: ‘Paray Shikshalaya’ for students in West Bengal||Poulami.Roy KOLKATA: The state government on Monday launched ‘Paray Shikshalaya’, a community-based schooling endeavour in neighbourhoods targeting primary students up to Class V to revive classroom education in the open. The aim of the programme is to wean back a large section of students who has dropped out of the formal education system in the past two years due to the closure of schools following the pandemic. Launching the ambitious project on Monday, state education minister Bratya Basu said more than 60 lakh students from over 65,000 primary schools will get to learn from more than 2 lakh teachers. The programme will get under way from February 7 and continue till schools formally reopen. Later in the day, the school education department sent a note to all DMs, urging them to take personal initiative to monitor and support the programme so that it reaches out to all target children. The state Sarva Siksha mission project director Subhra Chakrabarti has been made the nodal officer of the programme. While classes IX to XII have had an opportunity to sporadically return to school since the lockdown in March 2020, those in lower classes have hardly had any schooling. Only a limited number of schools in urban areas have had access to online teaching. The state government had earlier this month launched a helpline to connect students in classes VI to VIII with teachers. That initiative is called Banglar Siksha Durabhase. The minister said the local administration will be involved in providing assistance to the project. That will mean involvement of civic bodies like Kolkata Municipal Corporation, Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation and various municipalities across the state as well as panchayats in rural areas. The civic bodies will help set up the logistics required to operate an open-air classroom where all Covid protocols will be maintained. In November 2021, prior to the reopening of classes IX to XII, the school education department had prepared audio-visual presentations as a part of an awareness programme and circulated across all districts. The presentation included jingles and motivational speeches by Basu and eminent personalities like Nobel laureate Avijit Vinayak Banerjee to try and motivate students to continue with their studies despite the challenges.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/duare-classroom-paray-shikshalaya-for-students/articleshow/89102847.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Conman poses as BSF Major, dupes lab with RT-PCR contract promise||Kolkata: A Chitpore-based diagnostic lab — a franchisee of a reputable testing lab with multiple branches in the city — was reportedly duped in the name of carrying out Covid tests for BSF personnel at Kalyani. The accused, claimed police, had even dressed himself in BSF uniform, made a video call and then instructed the centre in-charge — all in the name of winning his trust and distracting the victim while the e-wallet transaction was being executed and forcing him to make an error.Thanks to a new detective department initiative where it is teaching about the first steps to be taken when such cyber fraud complaints reach the local police station, a young SI managed to block the money transfer and the loss — amounting to Rs 15,000 — is likely to be reversed. “At the time of paying/transferring money, UPI PIN/MPIN is required. But at the time of receiving money, UPI PIN/MPIN is not required. So if you are asked to provide a UPI PIN or MPIN at the time of receiving money, you should be careful,” reminded the cops. The owner of the centre, though, has claimed that he had not shared any PIN and had only clicked the payment option before losing money.“It was at 3.05pm last Friday that we received the first call from the accused. He informed us that around 20 odd Army men have been infected by Covid and they need to run a Covid-cum-blood test on each of them. We were asked to give a quotation and it was decided that they would pay Rs 5300 for each test. Accordingly, we asked for a 50% advance. It was then that they sent us an ID card mentioning as one Satish Kumar. It was mentioned he was a constable,” said Kamalesh Ganguly, the owner of the diagnostic lab.Around 6pm, we were told that they would pay us through credit card. Even as we tried the method, the transaction — worth Rs 50,000 — failed. It is then that this accused, who introduced himself as a Major, asked Ganguly to accept payment through a wallet. He claimed to guide me and made a video call to me. The accused was dressed in BSF attire. “At 6.57 pm, the transaction took place where the app asked if it should proceed with the payment. As I was convinced about the uniform, I clicked yes. Immediately, my account was debited instead of being credited,” said Ganguly.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/conman-poses-as-bsf-major-dupes-lab-with-rt-pcr-contract-promise/articleshow/89102848.cms||Amit Moulick

---||Kolkata||Cov clinic worry in residential bldg||Kolkata: On Monday, the West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission (WBCERC) asked the office of director health services (DHS) to send an inspection team to a nursing home in Kalighat operating from a multi-storey building which also has residential apartments. Some residents had raised issues on Covid patients being treated in the health unit. The commission will take a decision on the complaint after getting the reports of the inspection team and the licensing authority.According to the complaint, Ashutosh Nursing Home operates from the second floor on 21 B, Sadananda Road. While the first floor has a bank office and the ground floor has several shops, other floors in the building have residential houses sharing the same lift and the staircases. In May 2021, the commission received a complaint that the staircase and the lift were being used for Covid patients and to bring down bodies of dead patients. The matter then went to the Calcutta High Court’s division bench. The case, however, came back to the WBCERC on Monday where the court said the commission had the authority to take up this case.“During the hearing, the nursing home authority said it has been operating since 1978 in that floor as a maternity unit. But, of late, they had started treating Covid-19 positive patients that has raised concerns with the residents as the building has only one common lift and staircase being used by Covid patients as well as to bring down bodies,” said WBCERC chairman retired Justice Ashim Kumar Banerjee.The residents had not raised any issue before the nursing home started treating Covid-19 patients. The division bench of Calcutta High Court has removed a temporary injunction on Covid patient admission in the nursing home. On Monday the commission could not contact the complainant residents.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/cov-clinic-worry-in-residential-bldg/articleshow/89102850.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kolkata||Cops slap steeper fines for violation of Cov curbs||Kolkata: One might have to shell out more than the fixed Rs 100-Rs 200 fine for violating Covid norms. Surprise raids that are being conducted by cops in areas such as Netaji Nagar, Bansdroni, Bijoygarh-Jadavpur, Southern Avenue belts along with Ballygunge, Shakespeare Sarani and parts of Tangra (where there are higher Covid numbers) have created a major impact among the residents of the neighbourhoods. Police are slapping higher fines in these areas hemming the containment zones. According to Nirmal Banik, who runs a tea stall in Netaji Nagar, cops are keeping a vigil over all places of gathering, especially the tea joints that are frequented by local youths. “The cops have raided my shop several times in the past two weeks. A couple of youths were made to pay fines as they were caught without masks,” Banik said. Santosh Ghosh, a retired KMC official in Bijoygarh, said a joint Covid combat team comprising KMC health officials and cops were doing the rounds ever since the Covid graph shot up. “We can’t blame the government officers as a KMC team is giving adequate warning against shedding the masks. Then cops are penalizing those who are found without masks,” said Ghosh.According to a KMC health department official, the campaigns and raids would go on simultaneously though the Covid cases were dipping in several pockets of Tollygunge under Borough X. “We don’t want to invite infection in Borough X, which had the highest number of containment zones,” a civic health official said. “Those found guilty may have to pay more towards lawyer fees. Since it is not possible to get a lawyer all through the day, certain police stations are fixing a certain amount to be paid to them by the violators. This will be over and above the fine amount. Importantly though, all police stations have been asked to ensure that spot fines are not collected on the road but formalities completed at the police station,” said an officer.Senior cops at police stations said that those bringing their own lawyers will not have to pay extra. “Since the official documentation will be handled by the lawyer, the violator and the lawyer will come to an agreement. If the violator does not wish to appoint his own lawyer, we will provide a challan slip that will have details of the fine,” explained a cop from the south suburban division.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/cops-slap-steeper-fines-for-violation-of-cov-curbs/articleshow/89102852.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||Alipore zoo dogfight: Workers’ union fracas spills on to road||Kolkata: Traffic came to a halt in front of Alipore zoo that witnessed a “takeover” of the zoo employees’ union by the Trinamool-led INTTUC from BJP on Monday.Hundreds of Trinamool workers, led by Trinamool Jai Hind Bahini president Kartik Banerjee and INTTUC South Kolkata president and mayor-in-council member Abhijit Mukherjee, thronged the gates of the zoo, took off the BJP flags at the gate and shouted slogans while launching the Alipore Zoo Ekta Union affiliated to the INTTUC. BJP supporters owing allegiance to Rakesh Singh protested the “forcible change of guards” leading to a scuffle that spilled on the Alipore Road. The Watgunge Police had to struggle to prevent a clash.“There was no recognized union at the zoo. The so-called BJP union was neither a recognized one, nor did they take care of the workers. As many as 300 zoo workers approached us and wanted to get rid of the union that exploited them. They have all joined the Ekta Union today,” said Abhijit Mukherjee.Rakesh Singh, who used to run the BJP union, claimed that the police took the lead in the “occupy zoo union” plan. “How could the police allow hundreds of outsiders to gather in front of the zoo when they should have booked the Trinamool supporters under the Disaster Management Act? We had informed the Watgunge Police about a possible mobilization a day ago. But they looked the other way,” Singh said, staging a protest in front of his house.Singh said: “No union member joined any other union. The Trinamool had launched a whispering campaign that I would join that party. But when they came to know that I was not quitting BJP, the union members decided to stay with me,” the BJP leader said. “They (Trinamool) used force and also the administration,” a union member said.Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar said: “This is unfortunate. It happens in Bengal only.”Trinamool senior Firhad Hakim said, “The zoo workers have the right to choose their own union. Earlier some goons were controlling them. With the formation of this union, they will be able to voice their demands and concerns.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/alipore-zoo-dogfight-workers-union-fracas-spills-on-to-road/articleshow/89102853.cms||---

Traffic cops said that the rehearsal took place during office hours and traffic movement was allowed on the Red Road and its surrounding only after 11.30am. Just when traffic cops tried using the Alipore Road -Belvedere Road to redirect traffic, the escalation of political tension outside the Alipore Zoo main gate added to the pressure. The pressure on DL Khan Road and SP Mukherjee Road and finally JL Nehru Road increased manifold as all other parallel roads were unable to take the pressure. Police said they had plans in place to tackle traffic diversions but the sudden agitation outside zoo caused an upset. “Despite less traffic these are roads where even a five minute disruption can upset regular movements,” said an officer at Lalbazar. The cops also announced traffic plans for Republic Day. Red Road will be closed for all vehicular movement from 10pm on Tuesday till the parade is over. Guru Nanak Sarani (Mayo Road) will also remain closed from 6.30am on Wednesday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/office-time-traffic-hit-in-central-s-kol/articleshow/89102857.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The minimum temperature may slide to 13 degrees by Saturday once the northwesterly winds return and the impact of the western disturbance, that had triggered a low-pressure trough and led to rain over the last two days, wanes. While Kolkata recorded a minimum temperature 16.3 degrees on Monday, the city received 4.1 mm rain over the last 24 hours. It will remain cloudy on Tuesday though chances of rain are low, said Regional Meteorological Centre director GK Das. “The weather could remain unchanged till Wednesday, though rains may stop from Tuesday second half. We expect the weather to turn sunny on Thursday, paving way for a revival of the northwesterly,” said Das.“Since the low-pressure trough across Bihar and Odisha has weakened, there is no other system to block the northwesterly. Once it brings in the chill, the mercury will drop. We expect the weekend to be chilly,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/met-predicts-chilly-weekend-ahead/articleshow/89102858.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Republic Day 2022: Netaji tableau rejected by Centre on Kolkata's Red Road trial run||KOLKATA: The Netaji tableau, remodelled on the one rejected by the Centre, had its first trial on Red Road on Monday ahead of the January 26 show where it will be the highlight. The tableau of the information and cultural affairs department decked up with the words ‘Jayatu Netaji’ and with Netaji’s statue in its frontal part is around 52-feet long, around 11-feet wide and 16-feet high. Artist Monti Paul of Kumartuli, who created the statue and the bust of Netaji, was busy on Monday decking up the tableau to make it more attractive during the show on Wednesday in front of the CM. “The request came last Sunday and I agreed instantly. It is surely challenging to create Netaji’s statue and bust within a week’s time and I took the challenge and worked almost round the clock,” said Paul, who had been curving out figures since mid 80s. He said that he had also created Netaji’s statues which were installed at Lake Town’s Shree Bhumi and Beliaghata. “So I took it sportingly and now, due to shortage of time I cannot create more murals in the tableau which could have added to the attraction,” Paul said. The bust will be at the rear part. It is one of the biggest tableaus and will be the prime attraction of the R-Day parade, an official said. “We made the trial to see if it can move on smoothly during the Wednesday’s grand show,” an officer said. CM Mamata Banerjee after the rejection of the Bengal tableau on Netaji at Delhi’s Republic Day parade had taken an instant decision to showcase Netaji at Red Road’s R-Day parade. Thus, within a week, the new tableau was created and decked up with a statue and bust of Netaji which were both around seven feet tall. The CM on Sunday, while celebrating Netaji’s 125th anniversary, had said: “We will roll out the tableau during the Republic Day parade on Red Road.” She had taken it as a challenge as the tableau was rejected by the Centre at a time when the nation is celebrating Netaji’s 125th anniversary. Netaji oath-taking likely in syllabusThe taking of oath by Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose as Prime Minister in 1943 in South-East Asia may be included in school syllabus. Education minister Bratya Basu has indicated on Monday that the historic event may be included in syllabus and the expert committee has been given charge to review it. Basu said, “I have asked the chairman of expert committee to look into the matter.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/netaji-tableau-rejected-by-centre-on-red-rd-trial-run/articleshow/89102860.cms||Debashis Konar
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Strike derails food delivery, restaurants, consumers take a hit||KOLKATA: A strike by a food delivery aggregator’s partners, which started in Salt Lake and Rajarhat on January 19, has spread to 11 zones on Monday, hitting the city’s hospitality sector and consumers hard. The striking partners are demanding restoration of the base delivery fee of Rs 35 and a special incentive on specific delivery number brackets. Elaborating on the reason behind the strike, a delivery partner of Swiggy from Behala zone, Shanu Debnath, said, “Till 2020, we used to get Rs 35 (base price) for the first 4km of delivery and after that, Rs 5 extra per kilometre. During the lockdown, the base price was reduced to Rs 20. Besides, the special incentive for 14, 24 and 28 deliveries a day was stopped.” Shanu added, “We are demanding that the base price and special incentive be restored and that the additional kilometre fee be increased from Rs 5 to Rs 8.” Suman Ghosh, a delivery partner from the Salt Lake zone, rued that their income had reduced drastically due to the changes. “In the past two years, the price of petrol has increased from Rs 75 to Rs 104, but our income has reduced. Now, after working for 10 to 12 hours a day — during which we ride around 110km — and after deducting fuel and maintenance costs, we earn something between Rs 150 and Rs 200. This is simply not enough,” he said. The restaurants have been hit hard by the strike, though some of them have managed to cater to online orders by using their own delivery personnel. Asif Ahmed, treasurer of the National Restaurant Association of India, (Kolkata), said many restaurants had to face a 50% drop in online orders. “During the pandemic, several restaurants established their own delivery system and that has helped them keep the situation under control,” he said. City restaurateur Debaditya Chowdhury added, “The strike has affected every restaurant, cafe and cloud kitchen. But we’ve managed to keep the situation under control to a certain extent because we have our own delivery system.” A Swiggy executive told TOI on the condition of anonymity that only a small fraction of the delivery partners has gone on strike. “There are some payment related issues and our team is working on it. We hope to resolve it soon. All I can say at the moment is that our delivery partners are paid very well. They also have several benefits including medical and accident insurance, allowances and petrol incentives,” he said.  Swiggy, however, refused to provide details on the number of total zones and delivery partners working in the city.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/strike-derails-city-food-delivery-restos-consumers-take-a-hit/articleshow/89102861.cms||Bishwabijoy Mitra
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: 46-year-old professor molested for feeding strays, 1 held||KOLKATA: A 46-year-old associate professor of chemistry at a reputable south Kolkata women’s college, who’s also a cancer survivor, was allegedly abused, threatened and finally assaulted by a few residents of Paikpara in north Kolkata on Sunday evening after she tried to feed around 14 stray dogs and puppies in the area. The incident was reported from Mullickbagan from where allegations of throwing boiled water on newborn poppies had surfaced barely four days ago. The victim runs an NGO for stray dogs along with her 52-year-old husband and 19-year-old son. Chitpore Police rushed to the spot after the complaint was lodged and carried out an arrest. “We have arrested Biswapriya Roy (45), who works in a private firm, in this regard. He was produced in court where we opposed his bail plea and he has been sent to judicial custody till January 27,” said an investigating officer, adding that they have slapped charges of molestation on the accused. On Monday, the professor returned to the spot and fed the dogs amid cop presence. “She has also been vaccinating the strays at her own cost,” added the officer. “I have been feeding dogs in the north Kolkata area for the past three years, especially during the lockdown period. It is mostly a self funded initiative with the help of my family. I have undergone two cancer operations in 2019. On January 19, we got a call that boiling water was thrown on some puppies. My son came and reported that the strays here were not keeping well. On Sunday, around 4.15 pm, I came to the spot along with my family. We came in two cars. As soon as we reached there, we found three to four people waiting for us,” said the victim. She alleged that initially the men hurled verbal abuses and threatened to damage their vehicles. “They then threatened me by taking the names of politicians. I told them if they have a problem, they can designate a feeding spot or approach police. It was then that Roy attacked my son and husband. When I tried to protest and take a video, he tried to snatch the camera. He then pulled away my shawl, hit me on my chest . He also twisted my left arm and pushed me,” said the professor. She said the feeding of all 14 strays in this area would continue. The accused’s family refused to talk but some locals claimed the victim and her family brought “outsiders” and tried to brush away their “concerns” about safety of kids due to presence of dogs.

---||Kolkata||Kol air quality turns poor from moderate due to cloud cover||Kolkata: Despite rain on Sunday, the city’s air quality swung from moderate (AQI:101-200) to poor (AQI: 201-300) on Monday because of cloud cover and lowering vertical wind speed. The city woke up to a cloudy morning on Monday, with particulate matter hanging low in the air creating smog. Even though it was not a smart rain, Sunday drizzle cleaned up the city’s air to moderate air quality across the continuous ambient air quality monitoring stations (CAAQMS). “The sustained cloud cover and lowering vertical wind (below 2 metre/second) cause a spike in the particulate pollution in the ambient air as the dispersal of pollutants gets weaker with the progress of time,” said state pollution control board chairman, Kalyan Rudra.Ballygunge, Jadavpur and Rabindra Bharati University (BT Road) were the worst polluted zones with AQI hovering above 250. Salt Lake, Fort William and Victoria had a faster recovery of air quality due to vast open spaces. But the places like Ballygunge, Jadavpur and RBU that are located in congested areas remained poor till late evening. The meteorology can deeply impact the city’s air pollution situation. An untimely rain in early December rescued the city’s ambient air when it was sharply sliding to very poor (AQI:301-400). A recent NASA study revealed that the concentration of particulate matter also affects cloud formation. NASA scientists said that the formation of clouds is affected by the lightness or darkness of air pollution particles. This also impacts the earth’s climate.In a breakthrough study scientists explain why aerosols — tiny particles suspended in air pollution and smoke — sometimes stop clouds from forming and in other cases increase cloud cover. Clouds not only deliver water around the globe but they also help regulate how much of the sun’s warmth the planet holds. The capacity of air pollution to absorb energy from the sun is the key to warming up the earth.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/kol-air-quality-turns-poor-from-moderate-due-to-cloud-cover/articleshow/89102863.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Kolkata||Dec track accident victim’s family campaigns for safety measures||Kolkata: They have lost their son in a train accident near the Rishra railway station barely a month ago. The Rathi family has taken it upon themselves to ensure that no other life is lost in the same manner. Rian Rathi, a student of Class-XII at Techno India school, had a dream of a successful career in music. While he had wanted to study chartered accountancy, his soul was deep into music. On December 17, last year, his dreams were shattered when he was hit by a train. His friend, Kaustav Dasgupta, who was along with him, also died in the accident. Rian went out to see off the friend who had come to his house and while crossing the railway tracks, the two were mowed down by a train. Around 7.45pm Rohan called up his brother Rian. “It was usual for us to connect over the phone several times during the day, especially when I am away. That evening his phone kept on ringing and I got a little tense,” recounted Rohan. After several attempts, someone took the call and informed him that Rian had met with a train accident. Rohan immediately asked a cousin to rush to the spot. By 8.10pm his cousin went to the spot and came to know that Rian had been taken to the Sreerampore Walsh Hospital. By the time he had reached the hospital, Rian was lying dead on the hospital bed.“We got to know that the accident had happened between 6.30pm and 6.45pm. After being hit by the train, both Rian and his friend lay bleeding profusely but none came to their rescue,” said Rohan.In a response to a letter by Rian’s cousin Sakshi, the RPF said GRP personnel had reached the spot at 6.50pm and started arranging for a vehicle to take them to the hospital. RPF also said that in case of any accident the station master avails of a vehicle from Rishra Municipality, but no vehicle was available that day. “From the locals’ statements we figured out that Rian had been lying on the track for nearly 45 minutes before a Toto could be arranged. Had Rian be taken to the hospital earlier, his life could have been saved,” said Rohan.“Contrary to some media reports that Rian was talking over the phone while crossing the track, we learnt from locals that he was not talking over the phone. He used hands-free when talking on the phone and he left the device at home,” he said.  “There is no fencing after the platform. Since the area is densely populated, people often try to go to the other side by crossing the track. This has multiplied the risks of accidents. If the railway authorities can put up fencing along the tracks and construct a footover bridge or a subway, that could change the situation,” said Ashok, Rian’s father. “Our son will not come back. At least we can try to do something to ensure that no other parent has to lose their child,” Ashok added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/dec-track-accident-victims-family-campaigns-for-safety-measures/articleshow/89102864.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Two Tollywood actors sever ties with BJP||KOLKATA: Two Tollywood actors — Bonny Sengupta and Sohail Dutta — took to social media on Monday to announce that they have severed all ties with BJP. The actors were both disgruntled but the last nail on the coffin was the politics over the Centre’s rejection of Bengal Netaji’s tableau for Republic Day parade. According to Sengupta’s tweet, the party has failed to “keep commitments as promised”. He also went vocal for not seeing “any form of development” that the party had promised for the West Bengal and Tollywood. Dutta retweeted Sengupta’s post and added that “no sensible person can support the ideology propagated by the ruling party of New Delhi”. Sengupta told TOI that the Centre’s decision to reject Bengal’s Netaji tableau has hurt him immensely. “I am hurt by this exclusion. We can’t engage in political battles over such sensitive issues like Netaji’s tableau,” he said. Dutta is equally peeved. “BJP just wants to deprive Bengal. Netaji is an emotion for us. I strongly condemn what the Centre did with Bengal’s Netaji tableau,” he said. Sohail DuttaBoth the actors also highlighted how they were miffed by the way the party leaders were disrespectful towards artists. “It’s one thing to be earthy and speak one’s mind. But to verbally abuse artists and always demean them is very humiliating. I still stuck on, hoping that people will learn from their mistakes. Now, I see that this party is not doing anything that it had promised for Tollywood. Even during Corona, BJP has not organized any programmes to help people in Bengal. I see no point in sticking on,” said Sengupta, who had joined the party a month-and-a-half before the polls.  Dutta, who had flown to Delhi to join BJP on January 30, 2021, is regretting that ‘emotional decision’. He claimed that the party didn’t get in touch with them after May 2, 2021. “On the contrary, people from TMC have been in touch. I see TMC as my old family though I am not joining that party immediately,” he said. “I have been emotionally very close to Subhendu Adhikari and Rajib Banerjee. I joined BJP because of them and not because of the ideological standpoint. During the elections, I was sent to campaign to at least 30 places. At many places, the party instructed me to address Mamata Banerjee as Begum and Khala. Though I was not keen, I was forced to do so if I wanted to retain my membership,” Dutta said.  He recalled an incident where he was invited to a party event but not allowed to sit on the dais. “BJP doesn’t respect artists. I had wanted to talk to the media about the incident but was stopped by a BJP leader fearing that it would damage the party’s image. I kept silent but now I see that this party is not doing anything for Bengal.

You try to ask them something, but never know how much is too much,” said Neelam Jasraj, whose teenaged son studies in Class 12. The recent cases of the Clubhouse chats, where derogatory remarks were made against Muslim women, and the Bulli Bai app that “auctioned” many from the same community, revealed the involvement of several youngsters — some of them in their teens — stoking fears among parents about where their children spend time on the web. “What do I tell my son when he says his friends’ parents don’t probe as much as I do? If you tell children something twice, they shut themselves up, which is even more dangerous,” said another parent, whose son is a Class 11 student. With the pandemic forcing classes to go online, access to the internet and personal devices has been a double-edged sword. Some parents express a lack of understanding of how technology works while others are wary of intruding and say they don’t wish to invade their ward’s privacy. Meenakshi Agarwal, who has two sons, one in Class 12 and another who has just graduated, said her children refrain from publicly posting comments. “Parents forget to teach children about sensitivity towards girls. When my kids were growing up, I sat with them to make them aware. They will not do appropriate things,” said Agarwal. At the same time, she admitted there’s peer pressure and they could get “influenced”: “As a parent, I do have concerns.” Parents need to “get out of their comfort zone” and understand technology that young adults grasp quickly, according to psychologists. “They need to have digital literacy, but as there is resistance to learn more, the gap widens. They need to be able to have a friendly conversation with their children. There is a difference in connecting with them and probing them in a threatening manner,” Geetanjali Kumar, a psychologist, told TOI. Monica Kumar, another psychologist, said there are various ways a parent can communicate with the child. “Watch a movie together, have a conversation, showcase your behaviour as parents and decide what kind of a role model you want to be. During conversations, gauge what kind of comment you are encouraging. There is a need to indicate what kind of behaviour is appropriate,” said Kumar, a managing trustee at Manas Foundation. Not only parents, schools also play a crucial part, according to psychologists. “Many schools claim to have taken steps on cyber security and safety, but is it helping children? For instance, a school recently held a seminar and children gave a presentation on this topic. But they were just copy-paste slides on phishing and stalking and in no way child-friendly. It is important to explain to children why one should not share images on WhatsApp, Instagram or other social media platforms. It is high time schools make the learning personalised,” Geetanjali Kumar said. However, teachers TOI spoke to said schools have taken steps in this regard and explained to children about the pitfalls. “We have been holding workshops on safety and cyber security, for parents as well. We have asked them to check the browsing history of their children, but kids are smart and most of the time, parents are caught unawares,” Madhulika Sen, senior advisor, Tagore International School, Vasant Vihar, said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/as-hate-casts-web-parents-at-odds-with-how-to-keep-children-in-check/articleshow/89101821.cms||Shradha Chettri

It would take six months to complete the project, said a senior police officer at PHQ. “There would be around 400 such words in the glossary. However, it would remain in use as police lingo,” said the officer.The project was initiated by DGP Vivek Johri owing to concerns raised by chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on the use of the Urdu word “Dastiyab” by an IPS officer at a high-level meet while referring to “recovery of evidence”. Later, home minister Narottam Mishra too ordered to delete Urdu, Persian words from the MP police lexicon, and superintendents of police were told to drop using words from the Mughal era. Sources said MP PHQ has issued a letter asking senior police officers from various districts to submit suggestions within seven days about replacing non-Hindi words in the official lexicon.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/archaic-tongue-twisters-to-be-erased-from-firs-in/articleshow/89102904.cms||P Naveen

Bank unions have now demanded working with 50% attendance.The United forum of Bank Unions (UFBU) has already expressed apprehension that “bank branches could become Covid hotspots”.In a letter to the chief minister, convener Sanjeev Sablok and coordinator V K Sharma have written a letter to the chief minister highlighting the issue. “Instead of six days a week, the banks may be operated for five days with 50% attendance,” they appealed.“At least 10% of the bank personnel are infected in every branch,” said a bank trade union leader said.On Monday, there were hardly any bank personnel in the TT Nagar branch of the SBI. One of the most crowded branches buzzing with business activities, the banking operations were paralysed. A handful of bank personnel were manning the counters. “There are hardly 10 employees and officials,” a bank employee said. Talking to TOI, V K Sharma of UFBU said, “A large number of bank employees are infected. This is spreading Covid.” Banks with their headquarters in Bhopal (administrative offices) have started practicing 50% attendance. “If they can have 50% strength when there is no customer flow, it should be allowed in the branches too,” said Sharma.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/covid-hit-bank-branch-seeks-50-staff-strength/articleshow/89102907.cms||Deshdeep Saxena

---||Bhopal||Political ripples in Madhya Pradesh over Umang Singhar tweet||BHOPAL: A tweet by former Congress minister Umang Singhar and a viral video showing former chief ministers Kamal Nath and Digvijaya Singh during the dharna near CM House stirred Madhya Pradesh’s political cauldron on Monday. On Sunday, Singhar posted a tweet, which mentioned CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan, but the ruling BJP claimed it was targeted at Singhar’s rival, Digvijaya Singh. Singhar, tweeted, “High voltage drama is being enacted in Madhya Pradesh over the past three days, politicians should do politics of dignity and etiquette Shivraj ji.” He attached a photograph of CM Chouhan standing with Nath and Digvijaya, and speaking to a farmers’ delegation from the districts of Rajgarh, Guna, Bhopal and Vidisha. Home minister Narottam Mishra on Monday took a dig at the tweet and said, “Umang Singhar may have mentioned anyone in the tweet, but his target is Digvijaya Singh.” Last Friday, Digvijaya led a farmers’ agitation near the CM’s official residence, alleging that despite calling for an appointment with the CM for a month-and-a-half, he failed to get one. The senior Congress leader sought time to meet Chouhan with a delegation of farmers from Rajgarh, Guna, Vidisha and Bhopal districts, whose land has come under submergence due to the construction of Tem and Suthhalia irrigation projects. Singh sat in dharna with several party MLAs and farmers near CM House for over two hours on Friday afternoon. Midway, he was joined by Kamal Nath. Before joining Digvijaya’s dharna, Nath had an accidental meeting for 25 minutes with Chouhan at the state hangar. Both leaders said they met by chance as the Congress leader was returning from his Chhindwara constituency while the CM was headed for a BJP organizational function in Dewas. Chouhan finally gave time to meet the farmers’ delegation on Sunday and it was the photograph of this meeting that Singhar tweeted. To add to the political ripples, a video — with superimposed speech bubbles — went around, showing Nath and Digvijaya sitting on the dharna. Nath seems to be saying that he had met Digvijaya four days earlier but ‘he did not tell me, so I went to Chhindwara’. Digvijaya says, “It was not necessary to tell you because I have been asking for an appointment for over one-and-half-months.” Nath says, “That is true.” State Congress says there is no internal dispute. “Umang Singhar has mentioned CM Chouhan in his tweet. He meant that just to get an appointment, Digvijaya Singh is having to sit on dharna,” argued PCC spokesman Narendra Saluja. Regarding the video, Saluja said, “It is a simple discussion between two leaders. State party president Kamal Nath did not know of the protest and when he came to know he joined the demonstration. What is wrong with it? All that is being spread is BJP’s malicious campaign and dirty politics.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/political-ripples-in-mp-over-singhar-tweet/articleshow/89102916.cms||---

He was opposed to the views of both Golwalkar and Mohammad Ali Jinnah,” tweeted Digvijaya, adding: “Pandit Nehru was a disciple of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.” Singh also posted a video documentary on Netaji, which quoted the freedom fighter’s views on Hindu Mahasabha and Muslim League. The video claimed that in 1938, after becoming president of Congress party, Bose proposed to bring about an amendment in the party constitution. Through the proposal, he made a rule that no person attached to either Hindu Mahasabha or Muslim League can be a member of any organization of Congress party, the docu says. The video claimed that in August 1942, while addressing the nation over Azad Hind Radio Netaji said, “I want to appeal to Mr Jinnah and Savarkar and all those who are still working a compromise with the British government. They should know that very soon there will be no British Empire. Respect will be paid to all those persons and parties fighting for independence. But British government supporters will not find a place in Independent India.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/netaji-opposed-golwalkar-jinnah-diggy/articleshow/89102918.cms||---

Although there was no problem for the traffic coming from Prabhat Square side but at the Maida Mill side many vehicles were seen jumping the traffic signal and entering the wrong lane to take a shortcut. Traffic police officials maintained that they would deploy cops at the Maida Mill point and would strictly enforce the traffic rules. Notably, heavy traffic jam took place after the inaugural programme at the Subhash Nagar ROB on Sunday night as the tent and stage installed for the programme was not immediately removed. ACP (Traffic) Parag Khare admitted that people were jumping the traffic signal towards the Maida Mill end of newly-inaugurated Subhash Nagar ROB. He said that from Tuesday traffic cops would be deployed at the point and they would strictly enforce traffic rules. He said that as the ROB was inaugurated just a day before, so it will take some time for people to get accustomed to the new route. Police would enforce and make things normal within a week. He said that people coming towards the Maida Mill end of the ROB after the roundabout should take their left lane. They are taking the wrong lane after jumping the traffic signal just to take a shortcut which would be stopped by strict enforcement. He said that on Sunday the traffic jam on ROB was caused by the tent and stage put up for the programme. It was removed late which resulted in the jam. Everything remained normal on Monday and traffic moved smoothly.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/motorists-seek-shortcut-via-new-subhash-nagar-rob/articleshow/89102921.cms||---

More wards and areas than intended were impacted by the water supply outage. Kolar water supply provides for 40% of the state capital’s water requirement. “Jawahar Chowk main overhead water tank could not get water from Kolar. The situation resulted in water cuts and slow water pressures across many areas,” said a BMC water works official. Civic body had stated that water supply would be impacted in only two municipal zones. It included Ibrahimpura, Lakherapura, Peer Gate, Nadeem road, Loha Bazar, Qazipura, Gurjarpura, Kayasthapura, Kumharpura, Amar Basti, Hawa Mahal road, Fatehgarh, Noor Mahal road, Malipura and other areas under BMC Zone 2. Ginnouri, Hathikhana, Jogipura, Kolipura, Bhoipura, some part of Ibrahimpura, Islampura and areas under BMC Zone 5. The outage spread through other areas including zone 2, 3, 4, 6 and zone 7 according to sources. Through the day BMC water supply officials were not receiving calls. Some officials even diverted their mobile phones to other numbers. “Had it been summer season the situation would have been far worse. The weather conditions helped the BMC get over the situation,” said a retired urban development official. Water supply in two BMC zones could be fully restored by Tuesday. The scheduled outage was for interconnection of Kolar pipeline, water supply system in the areas linked with new Kolar project. Shutdown of the water supply was undertaken on Sunday and water supply was only to be impacted in two BMC zones. Some other areas were hit by no water supply or low pressure of supply, according to sources.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/new-kolar-pipeline-hits-water-supply/articleshow/89102922.cms||---

The order was communicated to the additional chief secretary (water resources) and the principal secretary (forests and wildlife) through e-mails and special messengers on the same day (November 5, 2021) itself,” he said.Thomas further said that the order is only a prerequisite for the long process that an application from Tamil Nadu to fell the trees will have to go through, before the request is granted. He said that Tamil Nadu’s request for felling 23 trees in 0.25 hectare just downstream of Mullaperiyar dam is pending for clearance since January 1, 2019, and it needs to be processed at the levels of division, circle, nodal office, state government, regional office and the ministry of environment and forests and climate change (MoEFCC). “The order dated November 5, 2021, of the chief wildlife warden can be considered only as a prerequisite for clearance from statutory authorities at all these levels,” he said. He further said that he had not given any clearance for removing the forest produce from the vicinity of baby dam or from the vicinity of earth dam.The government had cited that the order permitting Tamil Nadu to cut 15 trees from the vicinity of the baby dam in Mullaperiyar concerned interstate matters and was issued without any consultation at the ministerial level. The government had also observed that the order was against the stand taken by the state government in the cases on Mullaperiyar dam issue under consideration of the Supreme Court. The government then concluded that Thomas’s acts prima facie amounted to official misconduct and violation of All India Service Conduct Rules, 1968. He was subsequently placed under suspension under rule three of the All India Services (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1969. Later the government revoked his suspension, but is going ahead with the disciplinary action against him.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/order-issued-after-secy-level-clearance-says-bennichan/articleshow/89102924.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||‘I was relieved when my abuser was held’||Thiruvananthapuram: A recent Pocso case trial has brought to light the importance of teaching children the difference between good touch and bad touch.During the trial, the boy had told the court that the accused shall be punished as he made a bad touch.It was the awareness created in him by his mother and the teacher which gave him the confidence to stand up against his abuser and ensure that the accused got the maximum punishment he deserved.“I was not scared to explain the incident to the police and court as my teacher had instilled in me confidence. I was there when the police arrested the accused and I was relieved when I saw that,” said the boy.The boy had told the court that he knew the difference between bad touch and good touch and he had learnt about it in school.Thiruvananthapuram fast-track special court had found the accused guilty and sentenced him to five years’ rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs 25,000.The incident occurred when he and his younger brother were playing outside their home. The boy was not able to move as his hands were tightly held by the abuser. Soon after the incident, the boy pulled his brother and went inside the house.His parents were shocked by the fact that the incident occurred when all the family members were around. The boy, while remembering his teacher’s lessons, said that the incident had to be reported to police.In order to give him mental support, the parents informed the police.“I have always given my children awareness regarding child abuse. Sex education is not something which has to be talk about in a hushed tone. The world has changed. The need to give basic sex education to children at a very young age is necessary,” said the boy’s mother.“According to me, creating awareness should begin early. He reacted because he was aware. But there are children who are not even able to understand that they are being abused. He was relieved when he saw police arresting the culprit. If parents are not supporting the child, it will surely have a bad impact on their future. Though he got justice, the bitter experience is haunting him. He asks frequently whether the man will come back,” added the mother.The sex education classes were given to children by teachers as part of the orientation given by the school authorities. A one-hour class was scheduled daily to discuss social issues.The lecture on sex education was held a year ago and the boy was able to connect it with his mother’s words about keeping vigil.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/i-was-relieved-when-my-abuser-was-held/articleshow/89102925.cms||---

Between January 17 and 24, Category B patients in the government sector have increased from 449 to 640. As for Category C patients, the increase has been more than 100% in one week; it peaked from 56 to 121 during the same period. The district administration has issued stringent regulations in the district, which came under Category C due to increase in hospitalizations.Medical college is handling the brunt of Category C admissions. As much as 54% of Category C patients are now admitted to Medical College hospital, while 36% are currently under treatment at general hospital. Also, 45% of Category B patients have been admitted to Medical College, while 31% are under treatment at SAT.A total of 112 patients are under Category C at Medical College hospital. Category B constitutes the highest volume of patients at SAT; 71%. The occupancy in second-line treatment centre has also increased in the district from 250 to 389 within a week. The hospital occupancy in the government sector also showed a rise; from 261 to 383 in one week.ICU occupancy in the district has dropped from 40 to 37 in a week. As many as 166 beds in government and private hospital ICUs were occupied as on Monday. Ventilator occupancy for government and private sector was 39. Meanwhile, the district on Friday recorded 3,256 positive cases. While this number showed a drastic dip in positive cases when compared to previous days, officials hinted that dip in number was mainly due to error in portal for uploading test results. The LDMS (Labsys) portal has developed technical glitches and the NIC team has been working on solving the issue. The glitch has resulted in a chaotic situation as health officials are unable to create SRF IDs and laboratories are not able to upload the test results.  At present, an Excel sheet is being circulated and officials are being asked to fill in the details and send it to designated mail id. Hard copy along with samples are also being sent to the laboratories. The lab report available till January 22 showed that there was a dip in number of tests from 20,820 to 13,697 in three days. This was mainly due to test results not being uploaded due to error in the portal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/district-witnessing-rise-in-category-b-and-c-patients/articleshow/89102926.cms||---

The internal committee constituted by the corporation to probe into the fund fraud in zonal offices has completed the hearing of staff under suspension in Nemom and Attipra zonal offices.The corporation council meeting had approved a recommendation to propose the state government to dismiss the staff being caught in corruption and fraud. The city corporation had lost around Rs 32 lakh from its account after the money paid as tax was never credited in the corporation’s bank account. The investigation team had a hard time pinning the responsibility on a single official so that the amount could be recovered. With the police investigation also losing the momentum, an internal team has been placed the responsibility to make the staff accountable and ensure that the money due to the corporation is levied from the officials who had erred. The probe team had earlier confirmed the findings of the audit wing which had unearthed the series of fraud in zonal offices. As per departmental norms, memo needs to be issued to staff responsible and they should be heard before department-level action like censure, increment cut or any other measure could be recommended. At Nemom zonal office, the complaints filed by the corporation with police were mainly against the charge officer and the cashier. In Sreekaryam it was clear that one staff frequently took the money from the zonal office to the bank and when irregularity was detected, he was held accountable.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/civic-body-not-likely-to-revoke-suspension-of-staff/articleshow/89102931.cms||---

The university said in a statement here on Monday that the election is being postponed following a stay order of Kerala High Court and the new date would be announced later. Despite the call for postponement of the election from various quarters, the CPM dominated university syndicate had decided to conduct the election. The university had in fact revised the examination schedule to facilitate the election. Considering a petition filed by a postgraduate student named PK Vineetha, Justice Raja Vijayaraghavan V issued an order directing the university not to conduct the elections for the next 10 days. She pointed out that the election was scheduled without considering the grave Covid situation in the state. SFI state president VA Vineesh said SFI was pushing for the conduct of the election as the democratic forums on campus were inactive for more than two years now. The demands raised by other student organisations, including AISF, that the college election should be postponed were loaded with political motives, he said. SFI candidates won unopposed in more than 30 college campuses of Kerala University, he added. All student unions, except SFI, had requested university authorities to postpone the elections. The Kannur University is about to hold the election on Friday. While Calicut University on Monday decided to finalise the election date at the next syndicate meeting on January 28, the MG University is yet to announce the schedule. KSU state president KM Abhijith said the SFI leaders were pressing for the election with an eye on the university funds. “Majority of students are not on campus. It won’t be fair to conduct elections at this time,” he said. AISF state secretary J Arun Babu said that it is not the right time to conduct elections on campus.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/hc-intervenes-ku-postpones-campus-polls/articleshow/89102932.cms||---

She said the only worrying factor for the health department is that more healthcare workers are getting infected in the third wave. The minister said that only 43% of the ICU beds are in use in the state, and similar is the situation in the usage of ventilators. Only 13% of ventilators in the state have been occupied. The minister has urged not to create panic among people by giving such false and baseless reports. As a precautionary measure, the government has added 222 more ventilator facilities, 239 ICUs and 15,688 additional beds to meet any emergency. If needed more beds and ICU beds will be increased in the hospitals. All precautions have been taken in such a way that no non-Covid treatment is affected. All emergency cases are being attended and it has been ensured that no treatment is denied to any patient anywhere in the state. All such reports that the non-Covid treatment has been affected in many major hospitals of the state are totally baseless, she said. The functioning of hospitals have been affected since more and more healthcare workers are being infected. Hence it has been decided to recruit more people on a temporary basis for Covid care in government hospitals, said the health minister. Hospitals have been asked to take extra care to prevent the spread of Covid-19 cases in hospitals since more healthcare workers are being affected now. Hospitals have been also asked to carry out proper disinfection works at regular intervals inside wards and hospital premises, she added. Hospitals have also been asked to prevent gatherings in the OPs and strictly follow one bystander policy for every patient inside the wards. No shortage of beds in Thiruvananthapuram:As on January 23, 47% of the total beds in government hospitals and 43% of total beds in private hospitals are vacant. Also, 44% of ICUs in the government sector and 38% of ICUs in the private sector are lying vacant, and 87% of ventilators in government hospitals and 53% in private hospitals are also lying vacant. As on January 23, in the medical college hospital, the total number of oxygen beds vacant is 52. The total number of Covid ICUs is 21 and 18 are occupied now. The total ventilator kept for Covid patients are 19, of which only five are occupied. In the general hospital, of the total 25 ICU beds kept for Covid patients, 16 are occupied now.

He said the same civic body had allowed the construction of about 500 hospitals without checking whether they had BU permissions.

Ahmedabad is not alone. All major cities have been recording steady drop in Covid cases for the past two days after peak of the cases last week. But, wait before you believe the third wave has peaked, and rejoice. Pointing at test positivity rate on Monday, experts said that Ahmedabad carried out 15,234 tests to find 4,441 cases in the district — a TPR of 29%. While it was surely less than 37% recorded on January 21, the number of tests plummeted by 36%, indicate numbers. “The queues at antigen testing domes have not decreased, and OPDs at general practitioners is also full. But now citizens have understood that the official records may result in actions like micro containment and restriction of movement so they may not be reporting infections to the authorities,” observed a city-based critical care specialist. “Also, due to the mild nature of the disease, there are fewer chances that the person, who is not recorded on the AMC books, may turn severe..” But officials said the trend may turn detrimental if the persons who are self-testing, self-medicating and self-isolating are not being honest. “There is no way apart from symptoms like dry cough and mild fever to ascertain whether a person is a carrier. This may result in higher spread in the community. Thus, some districts with lower population have actually started getting records of those who are getting cough and cold medicines over the counters,” said another expert.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/citys-daily-tally-goes-down-by-half-in-3-days/articleshow/89102938.cms||---

In fact, you will also not need to rush to a pharmacy to purchase medicines. The Gujarat government has begun work on a project to provide free medical consultation over the phone and provide free medicine to your doorstep. The service is expected to be launched in the next 2-3 months across all major cities, after which it will be extended to smaller towns and villages. Jai Prakash Shivahare, commissioner, health & family welfare department, said, “On the basis of Centre’s suggested model, we will shortly launch eSanjeevani OPD to provide free telemedicine consultation to all citizens. Moreover, citizens will not need to go anywhere for medicines. Through e-prescriptions, patients will receive suggested medicine at their doorstep in minimum possible time, totally free.” The official added that, at present, the government is in the process of selecting agencies that will provide trained doctors for telemedicine consultation and distribute free medicine to citizens on the basis of e-prescriptions. “This system will prove to be a game changer for senior citizens and those who find it difficult to visit a doctor and even for those who cannot afford medicines from pharmacies. Initially, the government will roll out the consultation service. Later, we will offer regular medicine supply,” the official said. “The eSanjeevani OPD and medicine supply services will also be in sync with nearby government hospitals for treatment of citizens like further diagnosis and operations etc. We aim to start a pilot project in a few places. Then, we will implement the project across the state in the coming months. This service will revolutionize the public health service in state,” Shivahare said. He added that apart from ensuring that senior citizens and those who cannot travel get medical service at their doorstep, the service will lessen burden on public health facilities.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/soon-free-tele-consultation-med-delivery/articleshow/89102939.cms||Kapil Dave
---||Ahmedabad||Test-wary Ahmedabad relies on self-medication||AHMEDABAD: Dr Pragnesh Vachcharajani, a city-based general physician, says that for every 10 Covid patients they may be seeing, there might be 10 more who are happy popping Dolo 650 and other over-the-counter medicines without medical advice. “Nowadays, everyone has the prescription of the medicines to take - from sore throat to body ache. Often, the prescriptions get circulated around and the medicines are taken without the knowledge of doctors. It’s not a healthy trend,” he said. As Covid cases reduce in the city over the past two days as per government data, experts are pointing at the base of the iceberg where many with infections have probably not got medical help at all. Dr Dilip Gadhvi, president of Ahmedabad Medical Association, said that there is nothing like ‘non-harmful medicine’. “Every medicine has side-effects, and the treating doctor knows why some of the medicines are prescribed to a specific patient. There could general medicines, but it should not be generalized. The wrong medication cause complications,” he said. Dr Mehul Shah, secretary of Indian Medical Association, Gujarat state branch, said that rational and judicious use of medicines should be under guidance of the doctors only. “Otherwise we will invite other complications or masking of symptoms. We have already seen the impact of unnecessary use of steroids in the past wave,” he said.  Steroids are essential in fighting infectious diseases as they come to one’s rescue during severe inflammation and cytokine storm. Used recklessly, they can cause life-threatening side effects like mucormycosis, as seen in the second wave.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/test-wary-city-relies-on-self-medication/articleshow/89102940.cms||---

The pol’s heritage legacy and its narrow, busy streets present colourful vistas to filmmakers. The pol has been made famous across the globe by many Gujarati and Hindi films including the 2019 biopic “PM Narendra Modi” starring Vivek Oberoi in the PM’s role. However, now a group of residents of Dhal ni Pol say that film shoots cause major traffic jams and drunk crew members ruin the atmosphere. Filmmakers deny these allegations and are ready to boycott Dhal ni Pol and shoot elsewhere. An application to Ahmedabad Police commissioner signed by 67 residents of Dhal ni Pol has demanded that permissions for film, serial, and advertisement shoots be denied with immediate effect. The residents have written that if the shoots continue they will start an agitation. “Film crews violate the terms of permission and cause traffic jams because of which women, kids, and elderly people face problems,” the residents’ application says.  “The residents have complained about this repeatedly at the local police station. However, the commissioner’s office issues permits without taking residents’ opinions into account.” The application goes on to say: “When residents complain, the crew members and the bouncers misbehave with them and threaten them and even beat them.” The application adds: “Crew members violate the Prohibition Act and consume intoxicants openly which spoils kids and is detrimental to the pol culture and traditions.” However, filmmakers said the complaints are unfounded. “The pol has been made famous across the globe because of its portrayal in films and other visual media,” said executive film producer Dilip Dave. Many of his films have been shot at Dhal ni Pol. They include “Thai Jashe”, “Montu ni Bittu”, and “Suryansh”. “Film shoots take place with official permission and we ensure that no terms or laws are violated by the film crew,” Dave said. “Pols are public places and with permissions we have the right to film there.” Dave added that filmmakers not only take permission from police but also take pol groups into confidence. He said filmmakers pay rents to the owners of houses where shoots take place. He said filmmakers also pay the pol groups. “The government is promoting heritage sites for film shoots,” Dave said. “But a few disgruntled people are trying to raise non-issues.” Rajesh Sharma, a film director, said: “Pols are congested places and film crews have large vehicles.” He added: “That may cause temporary traffic issues but production managers are very efficient and solve them in no time.” Sharma shot his Gujarati film “Passport” at Dhal ni Pol. Sandip Raval, a line producer, said: “Only a few people have been complaining. Other residents don’t have any issues with film shoots.” Raval added: “If they keep creating problems for us though we follow every law, we will be left with no option but to boycott Dhal ni Pol.” He went on to say: “There are many other pols in Ahmedabad and elsewhere.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/complaints-complicate-script-for-films-heritage-star/articleshow/89102941.cms||Soumitra Trivedi

Petitioner Keval Kumar from Sabarkantha district filed the petition through lawyer Prashant Chavda taking exception to the recruitment process because, according to him, the state government has not conducted TET for the past four years. Undertaking recruitment process for fresh teachers without holding the eligibililty test for four years violated fundamental and basic rights of thousands of BEd graduates, the petition said. The petitioner also submitted that there is a government notification that says that TET would be conducted every year. However, it was last conducted in 2017, the petitioner added. Every year, nearly 40,000 students graduate from BEd colleges, and those who graduated in the last four years would be the sufferers if recruitments take place before TET is conducted. He claimed that all the benefits of recruitment would be availed by successful TET candidates of 2016-17. The petitioner has requested the high court to direct the state government to conduct TET first and issue advertisement for recruitment thereafter. He has urged that TET-1 and TET-2 be conducted first. For the recruitment of teachers, the petitioner has also asked for age relief for candidates.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/pil-demands-tet-before-recruitment/articleshow/89102942.cms||---

Sequeira said that he left TMC because after going around visiting a few houses in Calangute for campaigning he did not see any prospects for the party. He also said that when they left Congress, they felt that TMC was the only option, which is why they had joined TMC.

In a written representation to state education minister Jitu Vaghani, the association said the situation is not as grim as the second wave of Covid. “Also,neighbouring Maharashtra that witnessed the highest number of daily Covid cases has also allowed in-person classroom studies in schools from January 24. The government has also started vaccination drive for children in the age group of 15 to 18 years. Keeping all these factors in view, the government should consider allowing re-opening of in-person classroom studies in Gujarat from February 1,” it said. Earlier this month, following a surge in Covid cases, the Gujarat government decided to close schools for physical classes for students up to Class 9 till January 31.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/start-offline-classes-from-february-1/articleshow/89102944.cms||---

The project, however, will not be fully commissioned for another two years due to issues in the R-LNG evacuation pipeline, said government sources aware of the developments. Gujarat State Petronet Ltd (GSPL), the transmission company of Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation (GSPC), is to lay an 86km R-LNG evacuation pipeline. The pipeline will connect the terminal to the GSPL gas grid in the state. But construction work is yet to start on the pipeline, said sources. GSPL had raised some issues with the downstream regulator, Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB). GSPL had been waiting for more than two years for the authorization letter to start laying the pipeline. The Rs 622 crore pipeline will be laid between Chhara and Lothpur. “PNGRB only recently issued the authorization letter,” said a source. “Even if the tendering process is completed in the next few months, it will take at least three years for the pipeline project to be completed.” A stretch of the pipeline passes close to the eco-sensitive zone of the Gir Wildlife Sanctuary that is home to Asiatic lions. So the final approval from the state forest department and the Union environment ministry is required, said sources. According to the National Board for Wildlife (NBWL) guidelines, if a project lies within 10km of any sanctuary, a no-objection certificate is required from the standing committee of the board. According to a September 2006 notification, oil and gas transportation pipelines in the vicinity of national parks, sanctuaries, coral reefs, and other ecologically sensitive areas require prior clearance from the Union environment ministry. The State Board for Wildlife, Gujarat, recommended the pipeline project to the state government for consideration about fourteen months ago, said sources. GSPL had entrusted Secon Pvt Ltd with the task of undertaking an Environmental Impact Assessment study and preparing the Environmental Management Plan as well as the Risk Assessment & Disaster Management Plan for the proposed pipeline. The pipeline is expected to be 86.61km long and 36 inches in diameter with total capacity of 18 million metric standard cubic metres per day. The pipeline alignment has been planned in such a way that near the ecologically sensitive areas, cutting of trees will be minimized or avoided completely, said sources in GSPL.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/chhara-lng-terminal-faces-pipeline-delay-work-yet-to-begin/articleshow/89102947.cms||---

While we have already extended our intention to the consul general of India about any kind of help to perform the last rites of the four or sending their bodies home, we decided to organize a meeting so that the community can get together and express their grief,” said Shah. Kashyap Desai, a resident of Ottawa and one of the organizers of the meeting, said that it’s one of the saddest days for Gujaratis and Indians in Canada and all are together in the grief. Ash Patel from Winnipeg said that even they don’t dare to go outside during the blizzards. “One can only imagine what would have happened to the kids.

Anil Thanki, another organizer of the event, said that about 3,000 Gujarati families and students living in the country have expressed their shock and grief. “Not all is rosy anywhere in the world, and it’s surely not worth risking everything you have.

---||Ahmedabad||HC asks Gujarat govt if serial eloper can be publicly shamed||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court has asked the state government whether it can publicize details of a married man who has eloped with different girls only to dump them after exploiting them. This, to create public awareness and take preventive measures to ensure other girls do not fall prey to the accused. As the man in this case was nabbed more than seven months after elopement, the court also asked the police department to state how many man-hours were spent in tracing him so that the expenditure incurred in the process can be extracted from him. The high court has sought replies from the authorities on these aspects on January 31. In this case, a girl from Rajkot city eloped with the married man in May 2021. Initially, Thorala police registered a missing complaint and began searching for her. More than a month later, when she could not be traced, her parents moved a habeas corpus petition in the high court through lawyer Nirav Sanghavi. They complained that the accused was a married man and a father. He had eloped with a couple of girls in the past and this was his modus operandi to exploit them, they told the court. The court sought to know the antecedents of the man and the police reported three incidents in which criminal complaints were registered against him for eloping with the girls. After nearly six months of failed search by Rajkot police, the high court last month roped in a senior officer of Anti-Human Trafficking Cell for the probe. Last week, the girl was traced and produced before the court. The girl told the judges that she regretted her decision of eloping with the man and wanted to go back to her parents. Looking at these cases, the bench of Justice Sonia Gokani and Justice Mauna Bhatt inquired with the state government “the possibility of intimating the public at large in respect of such conduct of Respondent No 4 officially so as to create public awareness by way of a preventive measure to save other innocent girls”. The judges observed that the repeated incidents of elopement had not only made it extremely difficult for the parties but because of that, the police had to work for long and put in many hours; in this particular case the girl could be traced after seven months. The court directed, “Let the details of man-hours spent for the search of corpus be provided to this court for it to consider imposition of the cost.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/hc-asks-govt-if-serial-eloper-can-be-publicly-shamed/articleshow/89102951.cms||---

Police said the boy used to chat with the teacher’s daughter and the teacher threatened to ruin the boy’s life. The 40-year-old teacher Pramod Singh was arrested on Sunday. According to police officers, a Class 10 student of another Kendriya Vidyalaya branch hanged himself from a ceiling fan at his Chandkheda home on Sunday. He was the only child of his parents. Chandkheda police initially registered a case of accidental death and the investigation was handed over to the DSP of the SC/ST cell, Khushbu Kapadia. During the preliminary investigation, it was revealed that the boy was under pressure because Singh was constantly threatening him. “Singh had been transferred from Chennai to Ahmedabad three years ago,” said a police officer. “He was not happy with the boy chatting with his daughter. Singh began to imagine that they were in a relationship.” The officer added: “Singh began calling the boy and pressuring him to stay away from his daughter.” During the lockdown, the boy and the girl could not meet. Later, when the school reopened, they began chatting again. When Singh came to know of that, he called the boy and threatened to ruin his academic life and career. The boy was petrified and blocked Singh’s number. But Singh hunted down the number of the boy’s father. Singh complained to the boy’s father, an engineer with a private firm. The boy hanged himself when he learnt that his father was making inquiries about the alleged affair. Later, the boy’s father gave his statement to police, based on which a case was registered under the Indian Penal Code’s Section 305 (abetment of suicide of a child or an insane person). Singh is in police custody.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/teens-suicide-kv-teacher-arrested/articleshow/89102954.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat HC tells elderly couple to take grandson to his illegal immigrant mother in US||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court has directed an elderly couple from Mehsana to go to the US to hand over the custody of their five-year-old grandchild to their daughter who had immigrated illegally and settled there and could not return to India for now. The woman had obtained an order from a US court more than a year ago for the interim custody of the child who was sent back to India. After the US court’s order, she moved the high court in Gujarat to secure the boy’s custody. In February 2021, the high court had ordered the child’s paternal grandparents to hand over his custody to the maternal grandparents. The mother was insistent on getting her son back and requested her lawyer to ensure he was sent to the US. So, the high court inquired with the lawyer whether the grandparents were able to travel to the US. When the lawyer informed them that the elderly couple have got passports, the high court on Monday asked them to apply for a US visa and to request the embassy to consider their application at the earliest. This case involves a couple from a village of Mehsana district. They had immigrated to the US a few years ago without a valid immigration process. After they had a son, they sent him to India for proper care because they were facing difficulties in raising him. A year later, the couple’s relationship fell apart. The woman obtained the child’s custody rights till August 12, 2021 from a US court but could not return to India to get her son’s custody. In India, the child was with the maternal grandparents for nearly two years. When the custody dispute arose in the US, the child was taken away by his paternal grandparents. The HC ensured that the child’s custody remained with maternal grandparents. While insisting that the maternal grandparents should take the child to their daughter, the judges mentioned in order that the child is comfortable with them and it is preferable to send him to a foreign country with the grandparents instead of sending him with a stranger. Further hearing of the case is scheduled to take place three weeks later.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/hc-tells-elderly-couple-to-take-grandson-to-his-illegal-immigrant-mother-in-us/articleshow/89102959.cms||---

---||Delhi||Centre for a ‘holistic view’ on marital rape||NEW DELHI: The Centre told Delhi high court that punishing forced sex in a marriage as rape is an issue that involves “social and family issues” as well as the dignity of a woman and cannot be looked at from a “microscopic angle”. Urging the high court to give time to have a “consultative process”, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said he would be doing an “injustice to the citizens” if the government’s case was put in a “half-hearted way”. “Your lordships are not just deciding the statutory or constitutional validity of a provision. It may not be looked at from that microscopic angle... Here, the dignity of a woman is at stake. There are social and family issues. There would be several considerations which would weigh with the government to take a position to assist,” he submitted. Maintaining that the Centre has to be “very conscious”, the solicitor general asserted that in view of the petitioners’ submissions and same stand taken by both amici curiae, it would “not be appropriate” for the Centre to not tell the court to have a “wider view of the matter”. The government wants to consider the issue in a “holistic manner”, he added. Justice Rajiv Shakdher, who is hearing the matter with Justice C Hari Shankar, however, said the matter couldn’t be kept hanging and the court would like to conclude the hearings. “I’m not saying no. Let her (amicus) finish. I’ll give you another week-10 days, but beyond that, it becomes difficult for me to,” the judge said. “For some people here, there is a live case (of one of the petitioners), every day matters for a simple reason that some say this abuse is happening, maybe not reported but this is happening. Now it can’t be our answer that it has been there for 100 years, now what is the urgency. Now that we’ve started, we’d like to conclude,” he added. Meanwhile, the amicus said forced intercourse with wife violated her right to bodily integrity and her sexual decisional autonomy, and there was no other legal provision, apart from the offence of rape under IPC 375, sufficient to prosecute the husband for that wrongdoing. Senior advocate Rebecca John argued that the other offences that could be committed by the husband were distinct from the crime of rape.

This comes a week after the state cabinet approved Rs 161.77 crore for the project.While BJP has maintained the project was conceptualised when the party was in power between 2014 and 2019, JMM hit back by accusing the party of trying to claim credit for the tribal party’s work.Speaking to media persons, the district president of BJP, Vijayanand Pathak, said, “This ambitious scheme was conceptualized during the BJP regime in Jharkhand but after the party lost the assembly polls in 2019, the project got stuck and no progress could be made.”BJP leader Vijay Ojha, who was also at the press conference, said, “Although the JMM-led dispensation has already delayed the sanctioning of funds for the project, I hope the project ultimately sees the light of the day and benefit scores of people for whom this was conceptualised.”On January 20, BJP’s Palamu MP V D Ram, too, had claimed that the project was in limbo since 2018. A senior JMM leader said, “The party is always in the habit of claiming undue credit but our government believes in working for the people.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/jmmbjp-spar-over-urban-water-scheme-in-medininagar/articleshow/89102969.cms||---

These mills will be set up in 10 districts namely West Singbhum, Simdega, Godda, Palamau, Khunti, Dhanbad, Bokaro, Latehar, Garhwa and Gumla. Soren said the new mills won’t just generate employment but will contribute significantly to farmers’ income in the state to help them get the right price for their produce. Citing the scarcity of the mills in the state, he said, “On an average, we produce 50-60 lakh metric tonnes of paddy annually but could only process about 15 lakh tonnes into rice due to shortage of mills in our state. Currently, we have only 80 mills but there is requirement of about 100 more. As a result, the government often can’t procure more paddy from the farmers on minimum support price. But once these mills are ready, we will be able to address this issue. This is just a beginning and our plan is to have sufficient mills in every district.”Soren added that food processing and allied sector is one of the priority areas of his government to enhance farmers’ income and boost agriculture sector. “With about 70% of our population living in villages and dependent on agriculture for livelihood, we are working to address all the shortcomings in a timebound manner to improve the entire cycle of production and value addition,” he said.Oraon agreed, adding that the government must also focus on setting up mills for wheat and pulses now. He said, “Paddy is our main crop here but the state is now also producing sufficient quantity of pulses and wheat. We just do not have enough mills to process them.”All the proposed mills have received land at 50% subsidy through the Jharkhand Industrial Area Development Authority (JIADA). Industries department secretary Pooja Singhal said the existing food processing policy, which was originally launched in 2016, has now been extended for another year by the cabinet last week.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/soren-lays-foundation-of-14-rice-mills-to-be-set-up-in-10-districts/articleshow/89102971.cms||ASRP Mukesh

Reacting to Sunday’s violence in Chaibasa where a clash between villagers and police occurred after a fake recruitment drive for an alleged separate Kolhan state, Prakash said it required immense impudence to attack a police station over an anti-national movement for a separate state.He said, “The way the villagers demanding a separate state and laid seize to a police station on Sunday is a clear indication that under the Soren government, such anti-national forces are getting emboldened.”Referring to the Soren government’s move to remove sedition cases from scores of accused in the Pathalgarhi movement filed by previous BJP administration, Prakash said, “That was the first step where this government has hinted that it will be soft on anti-national forces. This is why we are now also seeing a rise in Naxal activities and a fall in the overall law and order situation.”Earlier in the day, Prakash, who is also a Rajya Sabha member, along with the party, Babulal Marandi, convened a meeting of all workers at the party office here as part of a nationwide orientation workshop to launch a micro-donation drive. Addressing the workers, Prakash said people who believe in BJP’s policies and vision can make any sort of financial contribution to strengthen the party. The donation could range from Rs 5 to Rs 1000, he said and tasked each worker to motivate at least 100 people to contribute through the micro-donation app of the party.Marandi, on the other hand, said BJP is aiming to become self-reliant and ‘atma nirbhar’ through the micro-donation drive. Meanwhile, former BJP MLA Barkuwar Gagrai along with his supporters rejoined the party. Before the 2019 assembly polls, Gagrai had left BJP but did not join any other party.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/chaibasa-violence-state-bjp-chief-says-hemant-govt-allowing-anti-national-elements-to-flourish/articleshow/89102972.cms||ASRP Mukesh

The doctors opined that as different variants of Covid-19 have emerged and mutations of the virus will result in the emergence of more variants in the years to come, the government must focus on implementing various surveillance programmes for other diseases, such as swine flu for example, so that they do not emerge as a challenge for the healthcare system, which is already reeling under a pandemic.Medical director and critical care expert at Medica hospital in Ranchi, Dr Vijay Mishra, said, “We all know that the virulence of the mutated strains of Covid-19 are getting weaker with each passing wave. So in order to not get overwhelmed with the emergence of other diseases, we must focus on containing other infections.”When asked about the way forward, Dr Mishra said, “There are several surveillance programmes which are already functioning under the aegis of the state as well as the Union government like TB elimination, vector-borne disease control programme. We need to focus and strengthen them further. This will not only help us in eradicating the risk of other infections but also help us save people from contracting infections like Kalahari, malaria and Tuberculosis, amid a pandemic.”The head of the new trauma centre at Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences, Dr Pradip Bhattacharya, said: “For years we have been facing the problem of different strains of viruses infecting among a major chunk of the population. Right now it is Covid but other diseases like swine flu and vector-borne diseases infect people almost every year and we cannot depend on vaccines every time. The government must focus on testing different kinds of influenza as well as other diseases that emerge from viruses bacteria to ensure that they are also tended to properly.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/doctors-concerned-at-lack-of-surveillance-on-other-diseases/articleshow/89102973.cms||Gaurav Pandey

The Union government submitted this on an affidavit before the apex court in a reply to a plea seeking door-to-door, priority Covid-19 vaccination for persons with disabilities.Collector Singh addressing the media said, “Treasury officers are directed not to disburse salaries of government employees in the frontline workers category without taking their precaution doses of Covid-19 vaccines.”“The precaution doses are linked to salaries. In health care workers cases also the hospitals (private) are directed to only disburse the salaries after eligible staffers take their third dose (precaution dose) of Covid-19 vaccines”, said Collector Singh.“Those health care workers including Asha, doctors and other staffers in government set up will get salaries only after taking their due third dose of Covid-19 vaccines”, added Collector Singh.Union government has allowed precaution dose for health care workers, frontline workers and people aged above 60 year after 39 weeks or nine months of their second dose from January 10.Since then, the district authorities had only administered precaution doses to only 48941 persons- that was only half of people, who were identified for it till January 31.The authorities had identified around 96000 eligible persons including frontline workers, healthcare workers, and 60 plus people for precaution dose till January 31 in the drive from January 10.Because of very slow response to the drive, even after two weeks only half of those eligible had taken their doses in the district.Collector Singh further on the question of Covid-19 vaccination to 15-17 kids added, “We are enquiring into anomalies of categorisation of kids in 15-17- and 18-years group.

This stretch on 100-feet wide Pardeshipura-Jail Road was 60-70 feet wide, creating a ‘bottleneck’ that used to witness frequent traffic jams.During the removal drive, shopkeepers of IMC’s market told senior civic body officials that they ‘purchased’ the shops over 40 years ago and their livelihood depends on the same. “IMC should have relocated us before demolishing the shops. Already marred by COVID-19, removal of the shops will leave us on the mercy of god as we will not be able to earn our livelihood” one of the shopkeepers said. IMC officials assured the shopkeepers to consider their plea and will plan to settle them. Before today’s drive, IMC had issued notices to all those, whose constructions are posing as hurdles in widening said stretch to 100 feet, the officials concerned claimed.Meanwhile, IMC, which has developed a bridge on a nullah flowing through Kulkarni Ka Bhatta area, has sped up the ongoing work of constructing an approach road at both the sides by removing all the constructions posing as hurdles in it.

Due to the negligence of civic authorities, the incomplete multi-storied building is flooded with sewage posing danger to the structure as well as public health. Work on the facility was started than a decade back and it was planned to accommodate around 600 four-wheelers and 1,000 two-wheelers, and also have an amphitheatre. The Rs 18.28 crore project was entrusted to a Hyderabad based construction company in 2011 and the work was supposed to be completed by 2012. But the plan went kaput after the contractor abandoned the project midway. Efforts to restart construction failed even after several meetings in the council as the contractor had approached the court and the abandoned building was completely neglected by authorities. District minister ST Somashekar too had visited the building in February last year and directed the authorities to call for a re-tender to complete the project. However, the carelessness in maintaining the incomplete structure has resulted in sewage flooding the building. The ground floor of the structure is completely filled by sewage from a damaged underground drainage (UGD) pipeline connected to the building. Mayor Sunanda Palanetra told TOI that the corporation will re-tender the project and complete the parking centre. “The incomplete building has become a black-mark for the heritage city. As lakhs of visitors come to participate in the Dasara festivities, seeing the incomplete structure just opposite Mysuru Palace will make them have a bad opinion on the city. It is very sad that the project is still pending for the past decade,” she said. She said the incomplete project is a shame for MCC. “Due to a chamber problem, sewage is entering the structure. We will take up retendering immediately. Based on experts’ report, we will take up the work. The corporation has enough funds to complete it,” she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/sewage-floods-mccs-incomplete-multi-level-parking-centre-in-cbd/articleshow/89102990.cms||---

To prevent delay in the construction of the houses, the construction amount will be cleared in three instalments instead of the regular four,” he said.Somanna said that as there was pressure on the MLAs and he had sanctioned 20 additional houses for each gram panchayat. “The officials have the responsibility to identify genuine beneficiaries even for the additional houses. The authorities must organise a district-level program from February 12-16 to distribute hakku patra to the beneficiaries who have got houses constructed by the Karnataka Slum Development Board. The authorities must also ensure that the local bodies collect property tax from the owners,” he said.he mentioned that earlier money could not be transferred to beneficiaries of the Rajiv Gandhi Housing Scheme due to technical issues, but the problem had been resolved and the beneficiaries would get houses in one-and-a-half-months. “We have sanctioned 4 lakh houses in rural areas and 1 lakh in urban areas in the state. The central government has assured to sanction 18 lakh houses for the state in the coming days,” he said.He also said that the housing department rules had been simplified to benefit people.Earlier, when MLA Yathindra Siddaramaiah said that a bill has not been cleared for 8,053 under-construction houses in his Varuna constituency, department managing director Basavaraj said that 5.70 lakh houses had been sanctioned under the Rajiv Gandhi Housing Scheme and the bill has been cancelled for around 1.55 lakh beneficiaries for failing to construct the houses within the deadline.While MLC AH Vishwanath demanded Rs 5 lakh for constructing the houses, Periyapatna MLA Anil Chikkamadu demanded houses for the Handhi Jogi community.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/somanna-greenlights-work-order-for-10k-houses/articleshow/89102991.cms||---

He said he will be forced to file a public interest litigation against the government. He told reporters that Sanskrit is not the language of livelihood. “A few languages including Sanskrit are dying due to cultural and practical reasons. But the government is giving Rs 300 crore and fertile land to the university in Magadi in Ramanagara district. It is highly condemnable,” he said. Only a few people in Karnataka use Sanskrit language. Instead of giving funds for the university, the government must use it for the development of government schools, hospitals and empowerment of women and children, he said. “As per the 2011 census, only 4,631 people use Sanskrit as a communication language. How many people depend upon the language for livelihood, education, and life?” he said. Former mayor and BSP leader Purushottam alleged that when the government schools and other universities are in a bad shape, the government is planning to spend a huge sum on Karnataka Samskrita University, adding it is anti-people. Activist KS Shivaramu alleged that KSOU funds are also misused for the proposed building of Karnataka Samskrita University.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/will-file-pil-if-govt-funds-sanskrit-varsity-activist/articleshow/89102992.cms||---

As per health department officials, with the expansion of health services, Chhattisgarh is setting new records. At the same time, ACI has treated a total of 22 cases in electrophysiology treatment and ranks fifth in the country along with Kerala. Top three hospitals in this list are from Jammu and Kashmir, while Chandigarh is at fourth place and Advanced Cardiac Institute of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Medical College in Chhattisgarh and Pariyaram Medical College in Kerala got the fifth place. Officials said it is a matter of pride for Chhattisgarh to get this place in the country in matter of treatment related to heart disease. The study of electrophysiology was started in 2016 at Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Medical College located in Raipur. About 70 patients have been treated so far since the facility was started.Electrophysiology refers to the study of ‘electro’ — in other words, the study of the activity of heart. Officials said that the ACI is equipped with state of the art facilities for this complex treatment, and how patients benefit with these facilities is extremely useful. Physicians associated with this institute said that in common parlance, if we assume that the heart works like a motor, then it basically has two functions. The first is that the heart pumps so that the blood circulates in the body and secondly, the structure inside it (arteries), which conducts “electricity/energy” to run the heart properly, have to function properly as well. If any problem arises there, then the heart beats too fast or becomes too slow. For the treatment of this problemat ACI, the problem is first detected and mapping is done. Then the problem is diagnosed by reaching the heart through the thigh vein.With the help of state of the art equipment in this complex treatment, ACI has set a new record by treating 22 patients in last year, officials said. Significantly, for these treatments, 3D EPS (electrophysiology mapping machine) is being used in ACI. This state-of-the-art machine used for mapping in electrophysiology is rarely available. Apart from Raipur, patients are able to get the benefit of this facility only in Jammu and Kashmir and Lucknow. The country's third state of the art machine is available at ACI, Raipur. This machine is used to diagnose the common heart rate problem as well as those complex problems by the doctors of ACI, which is possible only in selected hospitals of the country.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/aci-bags-5th-spot-for-electrophysiology-treatment/articleshow/89102994.cms||---

The high court bench headed by Justice Ahsanuddin Amanullah and Justice B S Bhanumathi observed that the petition was mistakenly posted before them without having jurisdiction according to the roster. One K V Krishnaiah, chairman of Andhra Pradesh Gazetted Officers Joint Action Committee moved the high court in his individual capacity, challenging the GOs pertaining to PRC. Arguing on behalf of the state government, advocate general S Sriram said interim relief cannot be the basis for deriving what is appropriate fitment to be given under PRC. He said the pay package announced by the state government should be viewed in a comprehensive manner. As the overall pay package has increased, similar to cost to company (CTC) in case of private companies, the employees cannot contend the PRC by pointing out individual heads of payment. The high court bench asked the representatives of employees to join the hearing. However, the bench pointed out a technical fault in listing the matter before them. Justice Amanullah noted that the petition was filed in an individual capacity, which should have been posted before a bench dealing with service matters. Even if it is filed in the interest of all employees, it should have been posted before the bench dealing with Public Interest Litigation (PIL) petitions.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/view-pay-package-in-its-entirety-says-ag/articleshow/89102999.cms||---

Positivity rate is increasing significantly in rural areas after Sankranti celebrations and the health wing authorities have deployed special teams and sample collection points to intensify tests there. Penamaluru mandal in the district registered 35 per cent positivity rate after Sankranti. Areas like Kanuru, Poranki, and Tadigadapa on the outskirts of Vijayawada city fall under Penamaluru mandal which has a population of 2.5 lakh. Officials tested 500 samples from this area recently, of which 210 tested positive. Many people in this area are moving to Vijayawada for testing. Mustabada stood second with 28 per cent positivity rate followed by Peda Avutapalli (25 per cent) and Unguturu (20 per cent). Dr Sundar Kumar, health officer at Uppaluru PHC, said hundreds of people from various metro cities visited the rural areas during Sankranti which is the main reason for the sudden spike in the number of Covid-19 cases. He said almost one in every family at Unguturu is sick and they are working round the clock to provide better treatment. Health wing authorities feel gatherings at cock fights, rangolu competitions and other Sankranti celebrations helped the virus spread rapidly in rural areas. Meanwhile, admissions to oxygen and ICU wards of government and private hospitals have increased slightly. Authorities have warned that hospitalisation will further increase in the next ten days. Two new Covid-19 care centres were added to the existing 14 centers in the district. New centres were established at Nuzividu and Nandigama to provide emergency care for the patients who are in need of oxygen.

---||Delhi||At crossroads... How delayed approvals are coming in way of Mukarba Chowk revamp||New Delhi: The Public Works Department’s plan to decongest the busy Mukarba Chowk seems to have hit a hurdle as the agency is yet to get permission from all stakeholders involved in the project. In addition to this, PWD was supposed to start a traffic congestion survey to estimate the problem points and collect data for drawing out the final plan, which has also not yet commenced. Earlier this month, work was awarded to a private company to conduct a three-day survey and submit the data to the department. “Data has to be collected to know the exact congestion points near Mukarba Chowk flyover. However, due to the rising Covid-19 cases, a semi-lockdown was placed and there were curbs regarding the movement of people. Due to this, traffic movement was not as usual at the intersection. We are waiting for traffic to resume normally after which the company can finish the survey,” said a PWD official overseeing the project. The comprehensive decongestion plan was conceptualised last year. According to the initial plan, two elevated roads were to be constructed — one near Bhalswa flyover close to Haiderpur Metro Station and the other near the NH-1 bypass. The company would be carrying out a “Traffic Volume Count” classifying all categories of vehicles for three days and for 24 hours mid-week on a working day. The traffic survey would be done at nine locations. Video recording of traffic flow would be done day and night in 12 directions. The plan would be prepared again according to the number of vehicles. Unified Traffic and Transportation Infrastructure (Planning and Engineering) Centre, the agency setup by Delhi Development Authority to monitor all road infrastructure projects in Delhi-NCR, had been approached by PWD with the decongestion proposal. For this, a clearance was needed from the irrigation and flood control department (I&FC), Northern Railway and National Highways Authority of India (NHAI). “We are trying to get the no objection certificate from I&FC as a few drains pass on the planned routes. As an elevated road has been planned on the national highway, we have written to NHAI to grant permission. The survey will give us the data about the number of vehicles after which the final plan will be prepared,” said the official. The traffic volume survey would be conducted on the stretch going from Outer Ring Road to NH-44 above the flyover, near Shiv Mandir, Sanjay Gandhi Transport Nagar, PWD Office, the central portion above Mukarba Chowk and other places.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/at-crossroads-how-delayed-approvals-are-coming-in-way-of-mukarba-chowk-revamp/articleshow/89101856.cms||---

Despite weekend lockdown on Sunday, he moved around the city for three hours and took stock of various works under the Smart City project. The locals and tourists have been suffering due to the slow pace and scattered work. The narrow dug up lanes and blocked access to the old city is still a concern for the locals and people have been demanding early completion of the work. During his visit Meena instructed the officials to complete these works at the earliest. He took up the drinking water project on priority and instructed officials to replace the old pipelines to control fresh water wastage. He pointed out to the open and hanging electrical and telephone wires and directed officials to immediately take care of it. Similarly, he expressed his concern over the new parking space, the construction work of the flyover and beautification work of the Ayad River.

The renowned and sought-after Sojat mehndi received the Geographical Indication (GI) certificate on Sunday. While the brand was included in the GI list last September, Rajendra Ratnoo, controller general of patents, designs and trademarks, came down from Mumbai to hand over the certificate to the farmers and merchants of the Sojat Mehndi Kishan Samiti and Mehndi Vyapar Sangh Samiti, which had applied for the status, in Pali on Sunday. The GI tag is expected to play a big role in discouraging surrogate products sold as Sojat mehndi. Secondly, it is also expected to increase mehndi exports. Till now, it was the word-of-mouth publicity about its superior quality that helped to attract buyers. Now, there is government recognition of it. A senior official in the industries department said that Sojat mehndi is known for high lawsone, a red-orange dye, content. The quality is determined by its colour, purity, and dyeing property. “The principal colouring content is lawsone. According to minimum Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), for ordinary mehndi, lawsone content should be 1. However, Sojat mehndi’s lawsone content is far better than the BIS minimum standards as it is more than 2.5. The high lawsone content has made it special and unique, in comparison to other varieties,” said Mahendra Kumar Parakh, commissioner, department of industries and commerce. Sojat city, also called 'mehndi nagri', is India’s largest henna cultivating and producing city. It has a special colour due to the area’s soil conditions and rain pattern. The good quality has motivated many local farmers to cultivate mehndi. About 90% of India’s mehndi output comes from Sojat, Marwar Junction and Jaitara area, and is valued at Rs 1,000 crore. Rajjak Ali, general manager, district industries and commerce centre, Pali, said, “There are 160 factories making mehndi in Pali area engaging over 20,000 people. The crop is cultivated in around 40,000 hectares and much of the produce goes to Middle East countries.” GI tag is a form of intellectual property, a certification given to certain goods or products which are unique to a geographical region. It is an integral part of the development which advances economic interests. These tags are a tool to protect the ownership rights on natural resources and manufactured goods. Products having GI tags prevent unauthorised use and provide financial gain for producers through exports.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/gi-tag-in-hand-sojat-mehndi-nowlooks-to-increase-global-footprint/articleshow/89102882.cms||Srikanta Tripathy
---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Elusive greater white-fronted goose pair spotted at Chandlai Lake||JAIPUR: A pair of the greater white-fronted goose from the northern hemisphere (Tundra) was spotted at the Chandlai Lake in Shivdaspura in December. This is the second consecutive year that the birds, which are rarely documented in India, have been witnessed twice at the lake. However, experts say that a pair has never been sighted in Rajasthan before, while a single bird was spotted in Kota and Chandlai last year. These birds travel either to the US or Central Europe from the Tundra region or the north of Russia and Europe. Kishan Meena, a bird conservator, spotted the bird strolling in the grass with other migratory birds in the mid of December. “For 15 days, I got the opportunity to observe the characteristics of the pair. The two birds are very shy and do not usually mix with other bird species. They feed on soft grass, which is found in abundance and goes to the lake only to drink water. The pair follows each other and don’t go far from each other. Maybe they were all alone at a sight which has 30,000-40,000 birds,” said Meena, who goes to Chandlai Lake almost every day. He has documented the sighting of the birds and has uploaded them on various online platforms for the record. The state government doesn’t have any platform, which records the data of rare sightings. “The visit of the Tundra region bird was never recorded in any census. As per my independent count, this is the 303rd species of bird at the lake, making it one of the most diverse destinations for the birds in the country,” said Meena. He recalled that last year, in March, a photojournalist had posted a picture of the bird, sighted in Kota. “I and my friends, rushed to Kota at the possible sights guessed from the photo but found nothing. To my surprise, barely after two days, I could see the never seen before bird, among the group of birds. I took pictures and shared them with the experts. It turned out to be the goose. It, however, disappeared in the next two days, leaving very little to document it,” said Meena.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/elusive-greater-white-fronted-goose-pair-spotted-at-chandlai/articleshow/89103013.cms||---

Bird enthusiasts think this is a good sign for the ecological system. Recently, rare Spanish sparrows and other species of sparrows were spotted here. Three days ago, a delegation of bird enthusiasts including Dr Divesh Saini, Parth Jagani, Dr Shyam Meena, Radheyshyam Pemani, Javed Ali spotted rare birds that have travelled thousands of kilometres from cold countries to desert areas. Divesh Saini said that with the arrival of winter season, birds from Siberia, Russia, and other cold regions migrate southwards. “We conducted a census in the Desert National Park and saw various species. Our team member Musa Khan, a bird guide in Sam saw 200+ species, which include house sparrow, Spanish sparrow, MacQueen’s bustard, Trumpeter finch etc.” He said “Among migratory species of sparrow, the Spanish sparrow is a close relative of the house sparrow. They migrate southwards towards Africa and western part of India in winters. The male sparrow is similar to the house sparrow in plumage, but differs as its underparts are heavily streaked with black. It also has a chestnut rather than a grey crown. Female bird is quite similar in appearance to female house sparrow.” He added, “The Spanish sparrow is usually seen in flocks and feeds principally on the seeds of grains and seeds of grass.” Zoology assistant professor Shyam Sunder Meena said, “In the beginning of August, migrant birds like Rufous-tailed scrub robin, Red-tailed and Red-backed shrike arrive in Jaisalmer for almost two months. They prefer to live in rocky habitats with grass patches. After the monsoon season this area of Thar is full of insects and various of herbs and shrubs. These birds are insectivorous and play an important role in insect and pest control.” Wildlife specialist Parth Jagani said that in Bada bagh area in Jaisalmer two days ago grey hypocolius of bulbul species was spotted. This species was found in 2019 and after a gap of 20-22 months it has been spotted again. Many migratory birds are still arriving in Jaisalmer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/winter-brings-several-rare-bird-species-to-jaisalmer/articleshow/89103015.cms||---

Along with strengthening the ACB with staff and technical resources, adequate budget has been allocated so that it works more strongly in effectively implementing the state government’s policy of zero tolerance towards corruption. Gehlot was reviewing the functioning of the ACB through video conference from the chief minister's residence. Instructing the ACB to act pro-actively in corruption cases, he said in 2021, prosecution sanction has been given in about 90 per cent cases by the state government, which shows the commitment of the government against corruption. He directed that the cases, which are pending due to any reason, should not get delayed due to sanction of prosecution. The CM said the agency caught corrupt personnel red-handed while taking bribe through 430 trap proceedings, which is the highest in any year after the establishment of the bureau. Last year, the ACB arrested 32 officials of the central government in bribery cases and disposed of 575 cases, which is an achievement. Gehlot said in 2021, the decision to sanction prosecution in 587 cases was taken by the state government, which is the highest till date. He said keeping in mind the poor complainants, the state government has set up a revolving fund of Rs 1 crore in order to increase the work efficiency of ACB and increase the pace of research, 239 officers-staff in all ranks have been appointed in ACB. The chief minister described the innovation of ‘Sajag Gram Yojana’ by ACB as a good initiative. He said it could become an effective medium to check corruption in rural areas and prevent wastage in public welfare schemes of the government. He asked the ACB officials not to be confined to the 51 villages selected under the scheme.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/acb-was-given-prosecution-sanction-in-90-cases-cm/articleshow/89103033.cms||---

One of the lawyers even served a notice for a sit-in protest in front of the Gandhi statue on the high court premises in Jaipur. Vimal Chaudhary, who had started practicing in 1977, but was rejected during the selection, said he will stage a protest on the HC premises. Another lawyer, Poonam Chand Bhandari, said eminent lawyers had been neglected during the appointment of 'senior lawyers' in Rajasthan High Court, due to which the lawyers’ community was feeling humiliated.Bhandari, the president of Rajasthan High Court Senior Lawyers Bar Association, said about 126 senior advocates had applied for seniority. He said many advocates, who had been practicing in Rajasthan High Court for about 30 to 50 years and fought thousands of cases, were ignored. The Chief Justice and second senior-most judge of the high court had joined only a few months ago, so perhaps they did not have information about the reputation of all advocates and the senior advocates had not been selected, he said, seeking a revision of the list.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/hc-senior-advocate-list-sparks-row/articleshow/89103036.cms||---

In reply to the Raj Bhavan claims that it was not sitting on any bill that benefits the farmers, the chief minister’s office issued a statement reminding that the Code of Civil Procedure (Rajasthan amendment ) Bill 2020 was passed on November 2, 2020 and was still pending with the governor. The bill was passed along with the three agriculture laws to counter the controversial agriculture laws passed by the Centre. The amendment said, “In order to protect the interests and livelihood of agriculturists of the state, it has been decided that if judgement/debtor is an agriculturist, then his agricultural land to the extent of five acres shall not be liable to attachment or sale. Accordingly, Section 60 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 has been amended.” The previous Section 60 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (Central Act No. 5 of 1908) provided for the property liable to attachment and sale in execution of decree. Proviso to this section provides for certain particulars that shall not be liable to such attachment or sale. That includes tools of artisans, and, where the judgment/debtor is an agriculturist his milch cattle and those likely to calve within two year, his implements of husbandry and such cattle and seed-grain as may, in the opinion of the Court, be necessary to enable him to earn his livelihood as such, and such portion of agricultural produce or of any class of agricultural produce as may have been declared to be free from liability PCC chief Govind Singh Dotasra joining the issue said the code of civil procedure was sent to the governor on November 24, 2020. Food and Civil supplies minister Pratap Singh Kachariyawas also targeted the BJP and the central government for not giving any relief to the farmers through farm loan waiver .||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/govt-reminds-guv-on-pro-farmer-land-bill/articleshow/89103039.cms||---

Kothari was arrested in Mumbai in March after an offence under GujCTOC Act was registered against him in February 2021 and he came out on bail around four months ago. After his bail, Kothari again got involved in multiple criminal activities and two offences were registered against him on charges of threatening. He was booked in Rander police station for issuing threats to a man in December 2021 in a property dispute. Recently, on January 18, he assaulted another man in a property dispute and issued threats for which he was booked in Athwalines police station. In both the cases, Kothari attempted to extort money from the victims though the police did not book him for extortion. Now, considering his repeat offences, cops are likely to approach the court to add additional sections in the original FIRs. According to the police, Imtiaz Bachav (44), a resident of Alfesa tower near Adajan Patia works as a land broker. Bachav, who had a dispute with another property broker, was called by Kothari to settle the issue. When he went to meet him, Kothari thrashed him brutally and also threatened him. After the recent attack on the property broker, Kothari went underground as cops launched a drive to arrest him. A team from the detection of crime branch (DCB) nabbed the accused from a hotel in Nagpur and brought him back to the city for further investigation. Meanwhile, cops have also approached the court to cancel his bail in GujCTOC case. N S Desai, ACP, E division said, “After the fresh offences were registered against Kothari, the police approached the court and requested it to cancel his bail in the GujCTOC offence.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/surat/gangster-kothari-nabbed-in-nagpur/articleshow/89103041.cms||---

It contains worksheets and audio-videos of Hindi, English, Maths, EVS and Social Studies. It also contains information related to early childhood care and education resources. The facility was inaugurated by EDMC commissioner Vikas Anand on Monday. School principals, teachers and students can access these resources using log-in credentials. As students can’t attend regular classes due to the pandemic, the facility is likely to benefit more than 2,25,000 students and 4,500 teachers at 354 schools. “To strengthen digital learning in schools, we have started the e-library, which is a repository of learning resources for teachers and students. The concept is being developed by the education department with the help of Tech Mahindra Foundation,” said an official. To help parents explore the facilities available at primary schools, especially those wanting to enroll their kids, EDMC has got a separate website prepared for each school last month. Each website has information related to online class teaching, students, employees and infrastructure. “Details of number of rooms, washrooms, playground, teachers, their qualification, activities performed, class-wise syllabus, circulars, performance and history are also provided. All websites are updated regularly and their links are on the recently started management information system portal of the east corporation,” said a senior EDMC official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/edmc-launches-an-e-library-for-primary-students/articleshow/89101865.cms||TNN
---||Delhi||NGT gives another push to protect Najafgarh jheel||New Delhi: To ensure a legal shield for the degrading Najafgarh Jheel, National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed the Union environment ministry to prepare an integrated environmental action plan (EMP) for the transboundary wetland. The NGT bench, headed by Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel, has also asked the governments of Delhi and Haryana, which share the lake, to make budget allocations and enforce the EMPs submitted by them until the integrated EMP is finalised. It has asked National Wetland Authority to monitor the progress and submit status reports by July 31. The tribunal has “expressed hope” that the inter-ministerial expert group will ensure the wetland’s conservation and protection with its water quality maintained to “at least Class C”, which makes the water drinkable after conventional treatment. “Healthy biodiversity needs to be ensured. The outlet of Najafgarh Jheel, which is leading to the Najafgarh drain, should remain free from sewage before it joins the Yamuna,” stated the NGT order on January 21 while hearing a 2019 petition by Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) to execute the tribunal’s earlier orders. From 24,000 hectares in 1960 to currently only 2,530 hectares, of which 1,400 hectares are in Delhi and 1,100 in Haryana, the lake is still the largest wetland of National Capital Region. Rich in biodiversity with over 281 species of birds as per official data, the wetland is battling degradation due to pollution, encroachment and other human disturbances like construction. According to the reports submitted to NGT, the degradation of the lake in its core flood area has exposed Delhi and Gurgaon to “high risks of pluvial flooding and reduced groundwater levels”. According to an expert report, “The left-out Najafgarh Jheel is the only landform that ensures safety to Gurgaon and Delhi from the massive floodwater during heavy rainfall resulting from climate change… Najafgarh Jheel is the only safeguard for both the cities against climate change and adaptation to extreme events — extreme temperature and rainfall.” Akash Vashishtha, INTACH’s counsel, argued, “This tribunal’s own Yamuna Monitoring Committee’s report says this jheel is vital for preventing floods in Haryana and Delhi, with areas as large as 212.5m remaining under submergence. Haryana’s draft EMP also states that it is a critical natural infrastructure for the region and is extremely important for groundwater recharge of the water-parched stated.” The notification process has been delayed as Haryana didn’t submit its brief documents to the ministry by October 2021. The brief document is the base upon which the ministry’s wetland division was to finalise the draft notification by November. “The lake had been mapped in 1807, and later in 1808, when an area of 240 sq km was recorded as the jheel; now only a few square kilometres are left with water,” said Manu Bhatnagar, director of INTACH’s natural heritage division.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/ngt-gives-another-push-to-protect-najafgarh-jheel/articleshow/89101866.cms||Kushagra Dixit

In the last two months, nearly 2000 such challans have returned. The traffic police are now going through images captured by CCTV cameras at the traffic automation centre and registering traffic offences. Using vehicle information provided by the state transport department, traffic challans are sent to offenders by post. Assistant commissioner of police (Traffic) M A Nataraj said that in addition to the manual booking of cases, the traffic police are going through images captured by CCTV cameras installed at important places. The police are using apps that help to find out the actual postal address of the RC owner and teams have been formed at the station level to trace the violators by visiting the addresses. “If we do not succeed in tracing the offender, the record of such vehicles remain in our database. Whenever such vehicles come on the road, fine is collected on the spot by officers. Every traffic officer from ASI and ACP has a handheld device and during routine checks, the old case details are also available,” he said. All these offenders are from the state and mostly reside in the city. In the absence of integration of the systems of state and the central transport departments, the traffic police are not sending traffic challans by post to vehicles registered in Kerala and other states. Fines related to such vehicles are collected on the spot. The police, on an average, book about 500-600 traffic violation cases per day. Meanwhile, due to software glitches, about two years ago, there were cases of challans being issued multiple times to the same offender, at the same time. Such cases are closed after seeking permission from the city police commissioner. People can reach out to the nearest police station or officers on duty at junctions, who will look into it, ACP said.A lady from Mudipu claimed that 16 notices were sent to her for a traffic violation in 2020- 2021 and was allegedly asked to pay Rs 11,500, The police have assured to look into the issue.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/nearly-12k-addressee-not-found-traffic-violators-traced/articleshow/89103051.cms||---

They have rejected the float on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose proposed by the West Bengal government. They have also rejected the float on freedom fighters Mahakavi Bharathiyar, VO Chidambaram Pillai, Rani Velu Nachiyar, Maruthu Brothers and other floats from Tamil Nadu. Earlier, the same BJP government had accepted Tipu Sultan’s float sent by Karnataka for Republic Day. The stand by the central government on Sri Narayana Guru’s float proves the BJP is not ready to accept the philosophy of ‘one caste, one religion and one god’ propagated by the social reformer,” Hariprasad said.The BJP lost the only MLA seat in Kerala only because of their stand against Sri Narayana Guru, he said, questioning the silence of BJP state president and MP Nalin Kumar Kateel and chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on the matter. “BJP leaders should have questioned the central government instead of justifying the mistake. Let CM Bommai and BJP president Kateel clarify why the float on Sri Narayana Guru was rejected,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/for-bjp-modi-is-the-only-guru-hariprasad/articleshow/89103053.cms||---

District surveillance officer Dr Jagadeesh told TOI that out of 5,628 active cases in the district, only 8.5% are undergoing treatment in hospitals. “We have noticed a slight decrease in the daily cases in the last four days. However, we cannot conclude that this is a downward trend immediately. The majority of cases are asymptomatic and severity is found only in Covid-19 cases among the aged and those who have several comorbidities. Hence, we have been creating awareness that people, especially the aged and those with comorbidities, should not neglect any symptoms. They should immediately undergo a test,” he said. When students in medical colleges test positive, they are isolated in the same hospital and their numbers are also added in the hospitalisation category. At least 30-40 medical students are in isolation in medical colleges in the district. The district has nearly 350 paediatric cases of Covid-19, he added.1,322 cases in DK, Udupi The coastal districts of Dakshina Kannada and Udupi reported 1,322 new cases of Covid-19 on Monday.

These proposals are yet to be approved by the town planning department. But the builders and developers demanded extending the offline process for the building plans submitted before December 31.The civic body officials said that the state government had given a 50% concession in premium charges by December 31 last year. Moreover, offline submission and approval of the building plans were effective by December end only.Hence, builders and developers submitted the building plans at large in December. Now, the process of approving the building plans submitted by December 31 will be carried out manually up to March 31 only, said NMC officials. The officials said that the online submission and approval of the building plans have been started from January 1 this year.Nilesh Chavan, an architect, said that extending the date for offline approvals of building plans is a good decision. "Although the government has started online submission for the new building plans from January, there is a need to have both online and offline gateways until the online system is foolproof and completely streamlined,” said Chavan, who is also the former president of the Nashik branch of Indian Institute of Architects (IIA).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/plans-given-before-dec-31-to-be-okayed-offline-till-march-31-nmc/articleshow/89103069.cms||---

Vehicle theft has become a challenge for the city police for the past many years, with hundreds of vehicles getting stolen every year. As per the data, in 2018, the police had registered 569 vehicle theft cases, 505 cases were registered in 2019, 417 in 2020 and in 2021, the police registered 460 cases till November end. Meanwhile, over the past two years, the detection rate of stolen vehicles has been only 17%. In 2018, the detection rate was 27%, while in 2019, the detection rate was 21%. Vijay Kharat said that nabbing the criminals involved in vehicle theft is the best option in keeping the thefts under control. He said that once a burglar is arrested, a chain of vehicle thieves is revealed. For the same, he has instructed all the officials to step up intelligence and nab the vehicle thieves. Apart from this, he said that the PIs have also been instructed to keep a watch on the activities of vehicle thieves who are on police records. The cops have been asked to check what these thieves are doing for a living and take necessary preventive action against them. Most of the time, the stolen vehicles are sold in the rural areas or the adjoining districts. Burglars generally sell the bikes to people at a cheaper price since they do not have the documents of the vehicles. The vehicles are sold on the pretext that the documents will be given to them later.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/nashik-cops-step-up-measures-to-contain-vehicle-thefts/articleshow/89103070.cms||Santosh Sonawane

The survey, commissioned by the Karnataka Evaluation Authority, has also revealed that 45 % bicycles are used by family members of the students.“Less than half of the beneficiaries, overall, bring bicycles to school regularly. Regular bicycle usage is even less among girls. Road conditions, houses being near the school, frequent damage of cycles and houses being too far are some of the reasons for non-usage. Statistical tests show that road conditions have a significant effect on the regular usage of bicycles,” the survey, done across eight districts, found out. Yadgir, Kalaburagi, Uttar Kannada and Belagavi from north Karnataka were among the surveyed districts.The survey has also pointed out that only 13% beneficiaries receive the cycles in first two months --- June and July --- of the academic year. “Current dates for procurement, bid evaluation and selection of supplier are not early enough to ensure timely supply of cycles to students, since it takes 90-120 days for the supplier to provide the cycles and other processes such as quality checks at various levels and assembly,” the survey found out.The survey also pointed out that the bicycles were of poor quality. “More than 40% students reported that parts of the cycle were missing in the newly received bicycles and had to add parts such as a bell or a seat cover. Bicycle quality is seen to deteriorate year on year after receipt. While 8% bicycles were damaged at receipt (as evident from beneficiary survey responses), 24% one-year-old cycles and 33% two-year-old cycles checked through direct observation were damaged. More than 40% used bicycles had defects on parameters such as a rusted frame, worn gear teeth and rusted forks. Rusted brakes and locks are common quality defects of used cycles. According to the parents, the bicycles become unusable by the time students reaches Class X,” the survey said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/govts-bicycles-improve-attendance-at-schools/articleshow/89103075.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

The Congress, which won 15 seats, managed to enlist the support of two rebel councillors, who had contested independently to help consolidate its position. Although the saffron party even tried to have three MLCs and a Rajya Sabha MP from other districts to turn the battle for the posts of president and vice-president into a mere formality, the Election Commission foiled its plan, by agreeing to consider the applications of Congress MLCs and Rajya Sabha MP after the election concluded. Laxman Chandavari and Shakuntala Akki of the Congress filed nomination respectively for the post of president and vice-president of the GBCMC.Supporters of both the parties started trooping into the grounds of the GBCMC right from the morning on Monday, and the atmosphere on the premises resembled on of a battlefield on the eve of war. When former minister and Congress MLA HK Patil arrived at GBCMC, BJP supporters raised slogans in favour of their leaders such as CC Patil. Workers of the Congress reciprocated by chanting slogans praising their leaders to greet BJP legislators and ministers. Before the election got under way, BJP functionary Anil Menasinakai, in an interaction with the media, accused the Congress of resorting to unethical means to grab power in the council. Usha Mahesh Dasar and Sunanda Prakash Dasale both secured 19 votes, with the BJP’s Haveri MP Shivakumar Udasi casting the decisive vote – the Congress candidates bagged 18 votes, including the votes cast by the two Independents, and MLA HK Patil.The results were announced by assistant commissioner Rayappa Hunasagi. HK Patil, however, alleged that the election had not been conducted in a transparent manner, adding that the Congress would take the legal route to challenge the results.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/bjp-pips-cong-by-one-vote-to-wrest-power-in-gadag-council/articleshow/89103078.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

This comes as good news as most people, especially children, find it difficult to take swabs from the nose and throat. PGI doctors feel that this alternative method of sample collection can even be used by people who are not health experts. A PGI study, which was recently published, found that toothbrush samples could be used as an alternative sampling methodology for patients in whom nasopharyngeal sampling was not amenable. “Not only is toothbrush sampling cost-effective and painless but is also a self-collectable modality, which requires no technical skill or mandate to follow special instructions on the part of the patient,” the study said.However, further research with larger sample size is required for the methodology to have a sensitivity of more than 60%. “We need to expand the sample size. The study is ongoing to make it the standard for collection of samples,” said Prof Krishan Gauba, head of the Oral Health Sciences Centre, PGI. The study was premised on the fact that during toothbrushing, oral fluids like saliva and gingival crevicular fluid, along with dental plaque find their way deep into the bristles of the brush. As the SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA has been detected in all three, it is reasonable to conclude that a toothbrush could harbour it too. The study was conducted by the Oral Health Sciences Centre in collaboration with the Department of Internal Medicine and Department of Virology, PGI on 25 symptomatic patients. The age of the patients was two to 72 years. Soft toothbrushes with end-rounded bristles and flexible neck were given to participants, who were asked to brush their teeth in the usual manner.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/covid-samples-can-be-taken-from-toothbrushes-pgi-study/articleshow/89103080.cms||Shimona Kanwar

---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Cops end ruckus, drag opposition councillors out||CHANDIGARH: Ruckus, arguments and cops dragging opposition councillors out of the assembly hall — never-before scenes were witnessed during the first monthly general house meeting of the newly-elected municipal corporation (MC) on Monday. Congress and AAP councillors came together to oppose the BJP and its mayor, not letting the house function for three hours. The arguments began just after the meeting started at 11 am, with the opposition alleging the mayoral election was conducted in a wrongful manner. AAP councillors demanded voting on the confirmation of the minutes’ agenda of the election. The mayor refused, citing no provision. AAP councillors turned aggressive, saying “they do not consider Kaur as the mayor” and demanded voting. Officers comprising the secretary and others told the house as the matter was in the Punjab and Haryana high court —AAP has challenged the election —no discussion could take place. The mayor and officers suggested they were willing to take opinion of the senior standing counsel of the administration regarding voting on confirmation. But both Congress and AAP councillors were not interested. In what seemed to be a pre-planned move, they rushed to the well of the house while shouting slogans against the mayor and the BJP. The AAP councillors accused the officers of being hand in glove with the BJP. When the mayor asked the secretary to read out the agenda, the opposition councillors disturbed the proceedings. In the meantime, Kaur told Gurbax Rawat, a Congress councillor, that her party had abstained from the election, then why was she raising questions over the election. This remark angered the Congress councillors, who joined AAP in demanding voting on confirmation of minutes. Kaur, after directing senior deputy mayor Dilip Sharma to sit on mayor's chair, left the hall. Sharma too tried to pacify the councillors. The joint commissioner-cum-secretary too kept asking councillors to maintain decorum of the house. Finally, the situation forced the mayor and secretary to call police and marshals and Sharma issued orders to vacate the well of the house and take the agitating councillors out of the assembly hall. Police and marshals one by one started forcefully taking the councillors out. Some councillors, however, came back and proceedings of the house started at 2.30 pm. Sources said it was the party leadership decision of both Congress and AAP to not allow the house to function properly if their demands were not met. Councillors of the opposition political party were even seen talking to their senior party leaders during the proceedings of the house. The civic body spends a huge amount on each monthly general house meeting.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/cops-end-ruckus-drag-oppn-councillors-out/articleshow/89103085.cms||Deepak Yadav

However, nobody was hurt in this pillar collapse. The slab of the newly constructed pillar collapsed after midnight on Sunday. The middle portion of the Jamnagar-Rajkot highway on which this bridge is being constructed is covered from both the sides while vehicles are allowed to pass from the service roads. The debris of the pillar fell in the covered area as a result of which no one was hurt. Moreover, vehicular traffic was also not disturbed. This bridge is being constructed by the road and building department of the state government. BS Kalariya, deputy executive engineer of the department told reporters, “The slab was constructed on Sunday evening and a crane working on the construction of the bridge collided with it. As a result, 15-20% of the slab collapsed. It’s the negligence of the crane driver.” According to the sources, had the debris fallen on the road, it could have resulted in injuries. This is the bypass road with vehicles from Jamnagar and Gir-Somnath going towards Morbi, Kutch and Ahmedabad passing through this road. A bridge at Hospital Chowk in the city is under construction and because of that, vehicles coming from Ahmedabad and going to the western parts of the city, enter the Rajkot city from Madhapar crossroads.

The BJP government has failed Indians on several fronts, be it economy, agriculture, employment or industries. “People are of the opinion that BJP is nothing but a ‘jumla’ party. Their only aim has been to remain in power by peddling false promises and fake news,” Sinha said. BJP had promised in 2016 that they would double farmers’ income by 2022. “What happened to it?” Sinha also made a strong observation on the Election Commission stating that “it seems like the covid norms declared by the EC are for all political parties except BJP.

While the 18-year-old girl identified as Rita Ambasaniya died during treatment at Rajkot Civil Hospital, the 20-year-old boy Devraj Mansuriya is battling for life in a critical condition, police said.  Devraj and Rita fell in love as they stayed in the same residential society Aarogyanagar in Wankaner town. However, after Rita's father died, she shifted to Dhamalpar village near the town with her brother and mother.  However, their love affair continued even though she had shifted.  On Sunday, Rita and her family had come to attend the marriage of her maternal uncle's son in Aarogyanagar. In the evening, Rita and Devraj met at a temple where they consumed some poisonous substance.  Rita was taken to Rajkot Civil Hospital where she died while Devraj's condition is said to be critical, said police.  "There were some injury marks on the girl's waist, so we suspected some foul play. But forensic postmortem confirmed that she died due to poison," said sources in Wankaner police station.  Though they belonged to the same caste, their families were opposed to their marriage and this is suspected to be the prime cause of the drastic step.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/couple-in-love-end-lives-as-families-oppose-marriage/articleshow/89103092.cms||---

---||Shimla||Enforce the law in Baddi, NGT to Himachal pollution board||Shimla: After finding that 97 industrial units in Baddi area not discharging waste water at the inlet of the local common effluent treatment plant (CETP), tthe National Green Tribunal has said the practice was a serious non-compliance and was having an adverse impact on public health and environment. The NGT came to know of the situation after the Himachal Pradesh State Pollution Control Board (HPPCB) filed a report with it and pointed to the units not following norms prescribed by HPPCB. The tribunal said the CETP was also inefficient and the situation required immediate regulatory action and defaulting pharma units needed to monitor API (air pollution index) and take remedial steps. Tribunal said this while conducting a hearing on the issue of discharge of toxic industrial pollution in Balad river in Baddi industrial area in Solan and the Sirsa and Satluj rivers. In compliance with NGT directions, HPPCB had submitted the report on September 30 last year, followed by a supplementary report on November 23. It was submitted that out of 456 industries monitored by the HPPCB and a joint committee, 97 industries were found to be non-compliant with norms prescribed by HPPCB for discharge at the inlet of CETP for further treatment.It was stated that no action was taken by HPPCB against 97 industries having hydraulic loading less than 200 KLD, which were found to be not complying with the CETP inlet norms. It said this was because the Baddi Barotiwala Nalagarh Industrial Association (BBNIA) had filed a petition in the state high court against norms.The high court had, vide orders dated September 1 last year and November 10 last year, directed authorities not to take coercive action against them. The principal bench of NGT, headed by chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel, in the order said that only explanation of the state was helplessness due to interim order of the high court. “We note that confusion pleaded is resulting in undesirable state of affairs, to the detriment of helpless public against the mandate of law which does not appear to have been properly brought to the notice of the high court or any other higher forum. We do not find any reason why the state PCB could not enforce law even against violators who are not covered by the interim order granted by the high court, particularly the pharma units discharging more than 200 KLD,” it added.Tribunal has directed the state to take corrective measures to enforce the law for protecting public health and the environment.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/shimla/enforce-the-law-in-baddi-ngt-to-himachal-pollution-board/articleshow/89103095.cms||Anand Bodh
---||Srinagar||About 135 militants waiting to infiltrate into J&K: BSF IG||SRINAGAR: About 135 militants are present at launch pads across the border and are waiting to infiltrate into India, BSF Inspector General, Kashmir, Raja Babu Singh said on Monday. However, he asserted that the overall situation at the Line of Control (LoC) is “peaceful” and said the number of infiltration bids was lesser in 2021 in comparison to previous years. “The overall scenario along the LoC is peaceful. Since the signing of the ceasefire agreement, there has been a general peace all along the LoC in the Kashmir frontier,” the Border Security Force (BSF) officer said while speaking to reporters here. Giving details on infiltration bids, he said in 2021, 58 attempts were made, in which five terrorists were killed, 21 returned and one surrendered. “There have been reports that 31 infiltrated in 2021, 130 in 2019, and 36 in 2020,” the inspector general (IG) said. During 2021, the BSF successfully recovered or seized three AK-47 rifles, six nine-mm pistols, 1,071 ammunitions, 20 hand grenades, two IEDs and 17.3 kg of heroin -- worth Rs 88 crore -- in different operational incidents, he said. The IG BSF said there are reports that “104 to 135 terrorists” are present at different launch pads across the LoC and waiting to infiltrate. “There are also reports that some guides have gone from here and crossed the LoC to that side. So, we need to monitor them as and when they return. Their families need to be monitored,” he said. Singh said there is a lot of synergy between the army and the BSF. “The more we conduct area dominations, keep watch and surveillance, the more difficult it will be for them to infiltrate. We are putting in all-out efforts so that no infiltration is allowed, that zero infiltration happens,” he said. “As and when anyone is spotted crossing the LoC, he is challenged and if firing is used, he is killed like the recent killing of a terrorist on January 2,” the IG BSF added. Asked about the Taliban threat, he said Taliban, “there is nothing like that till now, but we are keeping an eye on the developments”. “Nothing concrete has come into notice so far, but we are keeping an eye on it. We are keeping a strict vigil,” he said while responding to another question about the apprehensions of weapons from Afghanistan making their way into Kashmir. On the issue of drones, the IG BSF, said the drone threat is “very real”. “Last year also, drones were noticed, but no one ventured inside our territory. This year, we are taking enough measures, anti-drone techniques, we are also getting a few drones, and we will tackle it very effectively,” he said. He said the other challenge before the security forces on the LoC is narcotics. “There have been attempts to push narcotics from the other side. We have seized it. We have a zero-tolerance policy against narcotics,” Singh said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/srinagar/about-135-militants-waiting-to-infiltrate-into-jk-bsf-ig/articleshow/89103096.cms||---

He also said that the Border Security Force (BSF) has launched a number of operations along the International Border, including anti-drone exercises and those related to detecting tunnels. The BSF is also conducting joint patrolling with the army, the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and police to thwart nefarious attempts of terrorists, Boora said. “There is input that anti-national elements are likely to create trouble (in connection with Republic Day) but we are very, very alert on and along the border, including the Line of Control (LoC),” he said. “We have heightened our vigil on the border extensively,” the inspector general (IG) told reporters here. Boora said intelligence inputs clearly point towards the possibility of some activities from across the border. “We have got inputs (that such activities) like infiltration or induction of weapons, ammunition, explosives and its assembling inside our area or drug smuggling (can take place). But we are on high alert and we will not allow anyone to succeed in these nefarious designs,” he said. The BSF is carrying out extensive anti-tunnelling drives, special patrolling and depth area domination despite extremely hostile weather conditions. “ We have declared two weeks long heightened vigil on the border and extensively carrying out operations along the border, including anti-tunnelling exercises and anti-drone exercises,” Boora said. The IG said that joint patrolling and exercises are also being conducted along with the army, CRPF and Jammu and Kashmir Police to scuttle any nefarious attempts of anti-social elements. He said that “during this period, every year, there is a stress on the security situation along the borders.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jammu/republic-day-threat-forces-on-high-alert-along-ib-after-input/articleshow/89103097.cms||---

Durairaj, an unemployed engineering graduate was living along with his parents after he separated with his wife. Durairaj’s father Kuppusamy used to reprimand him and ask him to go to work. On March 23, 2015, there was a quarrel between them. Durairaj murdered his father by throwing a grinding stone over his head. Uppiliyapuram police arrested Durairaj from Thuraiyur bus stand on March 25, 2015. The Trichy principal sessions judge in 2018, convicted and sentenced him to life imprisonment. Challenging the same, Durairaj (appellant) filed the present criminal appeal in 2018. A division bench of justices S Vaidyanathan and G Jayachandran said that the medical records show that the appellant was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia since 2004 and was undergoing treatment. Even during his arrest, he was not in a good orientation of mind. The judges said that Chapter XXV of the criminal procedure code lays down the procedure in the case of an accused being a lunatic/ unsound mind. Under Section 328(1) of the CrPC, the judicial magistrate ought to have conducted an inquiry regarding the mental health of the accused person and he should have been treated in accordance with the provisions of Section 330 of the CrPC. This court finds that neither the judicial magistrate nor the trial court had followed this procedure in letter and spirit. The judges said that despite the production of the medical records, the trial court had gone wrong in holding that there is no evidence to show that there was no proof to show that the appellant was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia on the date of occurrence. The judges said that paranoid schizophrenia literally means disintegration of mind and includes hallucination and delusion. From the medical records, it is established that the appellant was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, during the time of occurrence. In view of this fact, the appellant is entitled to the benefit of exception under Section 84 (act of a person of unsound mind) of IPC, said the judges while setting aside the conviction and sentence of the appellant.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/hc-sets-aside-life-sentence-of-man-with-schizophrenia/articleshow/89103099.cms||Kaushik Kannan

---||Madurai||Tamil Nadu: High test positivity rate in 12 districts, but hospitalisation cases marginal||MADURAI: The weekly Covid-19 test positivity rate (TPR) in 12 districts in the state including Chennai, Chengalpet and Coimbatore is more than the state average of 18.1%, with nine districts among them recording more than 20% TPR. However, the number of those requiring hospitalization has been marginal across all the districts. The top three districts with highest weekly average TPR are Chennai (27%), Chengapet (26.3%) and Coimbatore (24.3%). On the other hand, Dindigul (4.4%), Nagapattinam (5.1%) and Kallakurichi (5.9%) have the least weekly average TPR. Apart from Chennai and Coimbatore, which are testing more than 10,000 samples per day, many districts are testing between 3,000 and 5,000 samples per day, while a few districts are testing 1,000-2,000 samples per day. In south Tamil Nadu, at least five out of ten districts, including Ramanathapuram, Theni, Sivagangai, Tenkasi, and Tuticorin have been testing only around 1,000-2,500 samples per day on average but have quite high average weekly Covid-19 TPR. “We are testing as required and trying to increase as much as we can. We cannot force the healthcare staff to collect samples when they are unable to find eligible people for testing. Previously we used to test all contacts of Covid-19 patients, but now only those who are symptomatic are being tested as per protocol,” said a health official. Elaborating on the Covid-19 testing protocol, the director of public health, Dr T S Selvavinayagam, said that a sufficient number of testing is being done in all districts. “We are not setting targets of any sort to any district. Testing is only done in line with the latest ICMR protocol and only if a person is eligible for testing as per the guidelines, they can undergo testing. Hence, asymptomatic people who may be exposed to Covid-19 need not get tested. If eligible people are found to be getting left out for testing, the districts concerned will be advised suitably,” he said. The health officials also noted that across districts, most of the Covid-19 cases are indicative of Omicron variant (85%), while others are of Delta variant (15%). Despite the high average weekly TPR, the percentage of Covid-19 patients requiring hospitalization continues to be marginal. “Though this time the spread appears to be fast and more cases are being reported in a short time, we can definitely say that those with severe breathing difficulties, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission and oxygen requirement are only marginal. The mortality is also being closely monitored and so far there is no drastic increase in the number of deaths,” said a health official from Madurai.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/12-districts-record-higher-tpr-than-state-average-of-18-1/articleshow/89103101.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

Health officials said that even for the second dose, many who are due for it, have not turned up to get vaccinated.As on Monday, as much as 84% of the eligible adult population received the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine while 54% received the second dose. On Monday, only 5,000 beneficiaries received the vaccine dose. “With more than 80% of the eligible adult population covered, the number of those turning up voluntarily for the first dose has significantly reduced. However, many are coming in for the second dose. At the same time, many who are still due for their second dose are also avoiding taking the Covid-19 vaccine despite receiving alerts,” said a health official.Some are forced to put off their second dose since there needs to be an interval of 60 days for those infected with Covid-19 to take the vaccine. “Since I had symptoms of cough and fever, I put off getting my second dose for the time being. Though it may not be Covid-19, I decided to take the jab when I get better. Covid-19 vaccine can also cause mild side effects of fever so I don’t want to risk it,” said S Karthiga, a resident of Balarengapuram.As many as 10,547 beneficiaries, including healthcare and frontline workers and senior citizens, have taken the precaution dose out of 43,688 beneficiaries who are targetted to be eligible till January 31. “We are trying to cover all healthcare workers for the precaution dose as soon as possible in both government and private sectors as they are most vulnerable. We also held a meeting with all private hospitals, instructing them to ensure that their employees get the precaution dose at the earliest,” said the official.Meanwhile, members under the banner of ‘People’s Federation against forced Covid-19 vaccination’ staged a protest on Monday in Madurai, demanding the state and central governments not to force the public to get vaccinated. The protesters held banners and placards and said that the governments must not take away the choice of the people by forcing them to get vaccinated.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/16-adults-in-madurai-dist-yet-to-take-even-one-dose/articleshow/89103103.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

The investigating officer who appeared before the court confirmed that the video circulated in the social media is that of the deceased. However, that alone would not be sufficient. The original mobile phone from which the video was recorded is required for forensic analysis to confirm its authenticity. Petitioner S Muruganantham, father of the deceased girl, who appeared before the court through videoconferencing, stated that the video had been recorded by Muthuvel. He also stated that Muthuvel would appear before the investigation officer and hand over his mobile phone at 10am on Tuesday. Taking cognizance of the submissions, justice G R Swaminathan directed Muthuvel to appear before the investigating officer and hand over his mobile phone on Tuesday. The judge also asked the petitioner and his wife to appear before the investigating officer on Tuesday so that their statements could be recorded. The judge directed the investigating officer to send the mobile phone along with the CD containing the video to the Tamil Nadu Forensic Science Laboratory at Mylapore in Chennai on Tuesday. The judge directed the director of the laboratory to examine the mobile phone and other materials furnished by the investigating officer on the same day and give a report regarding the authenticity. The judge directed the regional forensic laboratory in Thanjavur to submit the viscera report and the postmortem report containing the final opinion to the investigation officer before January 27 evening. Pursuant to the earlier direction of this court, the petitioner and his wife appeared before the Thanjavur judicial magistrate III on Sunday and their statements were recorded under 164 of CrPC. The authenticated copies of the statements were submitted before the court and the same was handed over to the investigating officer. Muruganantham had stated that his daughter committed suicide only because of the torture meted out to her at the hands of the school management following the refusal for religious conversion. However, Thanjavur district superintendent of police told the media that there was no complaint of forcible religious conversion. Since the statement of SP raised suspicion, the petitioner moved the HC Madurai bench seeking CB-CID probe in this case. The case was adjourned to January 28.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/girl-suicide-man-told-to-hand-over-mobile/articleshow/89103105.cms||---

In a letter to Union minister of health and family welfare Dr Mansukh Mandaviya, the MP noted that the online stray vacancy round for AIQ/central and deemed/ PG DNB seats counselling has been slated from March 11 to March 16, 2022. “Inordinate delay in completion of 2021 counselling is no fault of the candidates. In this situation, date for NEET PG 2022 has been announced and it is going to be held on March 12, which is even before the conclusion of NEET PG counselling 2021,” he said. The MP pointed out that it puts many candidates who are attending counselling on the dates after the NEET PG 2022 in great ordeal and fear they may have to waste one year because of clash in dates. “I feel this is unfair and the said decision to conduct examination before the end of counselling for the previous year is taken without application of mind. I would request you to intervene at the earliest and render justice by postponing the exams at least by one month,” he added. Many candidates have posted on various social media platforms, seeking postponement of the NEET PG 2022 with the hashtag of #PostponeNEETPG2022. The NEET PG counselling 2021 was postponed last year by several months due to the matter regarding EWS and OBC quota going to Supreme Court. The court finally giving nod for 10% quota for EWS and 27% quota for OBC.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/su-venkatesan-seeks-postponement-of-neet-pg-exam-22/articleshow/89103107.cms||---

A division bench of justices Pushpa Sathyanarayana and S Srimathy passed the order after the Centre submitted that the approval for the appointments made was awaited. The court was hearing the petition filed by M Senthilkumar, secretary of the DRT Madurai Bar Association, seeking for a direction to fill up the post of presiding officer of DRT Madurai. The petitioner stated that DRT Madurai is one of the largest in the country which has jurisdiction over 10 districts. He stated that the DRT Madurai is not able to discharge its functions properly since its presiding officer has been assigned additional charges of other DRTs. Due to this, the presiding officer was not able to officiate in DRT Madurai on all the working days which resulted in the increase of pendency of cases. He stated that the banks and the financial institutions are proceeding with recovery actions under the SARFAESI Act by issuing auction sale notices and getting orders under Section 14 of the Act for taking physical possession of the properties. In the absence of the presiding officer, the borrowers and other third parties who are affected by the action of the banks and financial institutions are left without any remedy as they are not able to file any appeals to ventilate their grievances. Hence, the petitioner moved the HC Madurai bench seeking for a direction to fill up the post of presiding officer at the earliest, to ensure the proper and smooth functioning of the DRT Madurai.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/expedite-process-to-fill-up-vacancies-in-drts-says-court/articleshow/89103108.cms||---

With the government announcing many schemes for the city recently, Madurai residents hope to see a cleaner city with well-maintained waterbodies in the coming years.Madurai was the second corporation in Tamil Nadu when it was formed on May 1, 1971 after Chennai. At that time, the city was spread over an area of 51.82sqkm with 72 wards.A drainage system was established in the areas surrounding the Meenakshi temple in 1902. The system, which provided drinking water to Madurai municipality by filtering the water from the Vaigai, was initiated during the British era in 1892. The expansion continued and when it became a corporation, the 72 wards got water easily.The corporation was expanded area wise from 51sqkm to 148sqkm in 2011 and the number of wards increased to 100. The expansion resulted in three municipalities, three town panchayats and 11 village panchayats coming under the civic body.Madurai city’s population was 14,70,755 as per the 2011 census. Now, it has a population of 2,57,8201. It has 13 higher secondary schools, nine high schools, 14 middle schools, 26 primary schools, 31 urban PHCs and three siddha hospitals.The city is being developed under the smart city programme at a cost of Rs 1,000 crore. “Solid waste management is something that the corporation has been unable to achieve through proper source segregation. Still it is not free from filthy, smelly garbage,” said A Asokan of Makkal Sakthi Iyakkam.Microcomposting centres established in the wards are yet to become fully functional. As many as 41 MCCs were planned in the city but many of them are not fully functional, said M P Sankarapandian of Sellur.Shifting the wholesale market to the outskirts would decongest the city to a large extent, say many residents.Corporation commissioner Dr K P Karthikeyan said that the announcements made by chief minister M K Stalin will pave the way for the large-scale development of the city. Relaying of roads at a cost of Rs 104 crore has been taken up, he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/covid-hits-madurai-corpns-golden-jubilee-celebrations/articleshow/89103110.cms||---

In its petition, the Vaigai private unaided schools welfare association under the federation of private schools association (FePSA), said that schools being closed for more than one-and-a-half years, students’ learning was greatly affected. “Even the World Health Organization and experts from across the globe are not recommending closure of schools. Prolonged closure of schools is also leading to increase in students being forced into child marriage and child labour,” the association said. The association hence demanded the state government to consider the welfare of students and reopen schools for all classes with 50% attendance on a rotational basis immediately. “More than 80% of students aged 15-18 years have also received first dose of Covid-19 vaccine. A majority of parents are also urging for schools to reopen,” they added. Various district-level associations across the state submitted petitions to their respective district collectors on Monday. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/reopen-schools-with-50-attendance/articleshow/89103111.cms||---

The SP has fielded Sambhal MP Shafiqur Rahman Barq’s grandson Zia-Ur Rehman on the seat.  Meanwhile, SP MLA from Rampur Iqram Qureshi, who won the Moradabad Dehat constituency in 2017, was also denied a party ticket. The SP is fielding Mohammed Nasir on the seat. Qureshi alleged that he was denied a ticket because he failed to fulfil the cash demand for buying the party ticket.  Iqram said, “Akhilesh Yadav is ignoring the people who have been loyal to him for years. We stood by him and helped him hold the party members together during difficult times. But, now, we are being ignored for the people who have changed parties for personal benefits. Such move may prove costly as party workers are extremely unhappy with the ticket distribution.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/denied-ticket-sp-sitting-mla-mohammed-haji-joins-bsp/articleshow/89103113.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

During the launch of this mega programme, the CM had planted a mahogany sapling at his official 1, Anne Marg residence. State environment, forest and climate change department principal secretary Dipak Kumar Singh on Monday said nearly four crore saplings have been planted so far. “An ambitious target of five crore was intentionally kept so that a milestone could be reached. Timber saplings have been mainly planted under the scheme,” he added. Asked about the status of green cover in the state after the addition of new saplings, Singh said the department was calculating the number of trees and would announce the exact numbers soon. The government had earlier said that the forest cover in the state was 15% and the fresh initiatives would make it 17%. Singh added various plans were made to create awareness among common people about the importance of green cover, but some of them could not be executed due to Covid pandemic. “We are using media platforms to take the message to the people.

Its funded by the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO). Inaugurating the lab, Bihar State Aids control Society project director Anshul Agarwal said this new facility would help in assessing the load of virus in the patients suffering from HIV so as to provide the right line of treatment. This lab will provide the viral load assessment free of cost. “The antiretroviral treatment (ART) centres situated in all the districts would send their samples to this lab having the capacity of assessment of 100 samples in a shift. If there is a load of samples, the testing capacity would be increased by doubling the daily shift,” said Anshul. No individual or organisation other than ART centres would have the liberty to send their samples for test in this lab. Though presently this lab would serve only HIV patients, its area of test may be widened for the samples of Hepatitis B and C after certain customisation in the medical tool, he said.

AAP MP Sanjay Singh had stated that the treatment meted out to the woman was unjustified. Singh had also stated, “The police had not listed charges against her but she is being denied bail even though she had been married to Amar Dubey just three days before the incident.”Similarly, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) leader Satish Chandra Mishra had been going on repeatedly making statements in his ‘Prabuddha Warg Sammelans’ that ‘innocent Brahmins’ were targeted in the Bikru case.Mishra had even stated that the report filed in the Bikru case will be investigated if the BSP government is formed in the state. Mishra has also been saying that the widow of Amar Dubey, who has been languishing in jail since the past one year, would be provided best legal aid to secure her release. Now, with the announcement of Assembly election dates, several political parties are in touch and luring Gayatri Tiwari, the mother of Vikas Dubey’s henchman Amar Dubey’s wife, to fight the election. But she declined, saying she is grateful to all of them, but as her daughter is in jail, she cannot contest any election right now.“My daughter is in jail and ill, how can I enter the election fray? We are grateful to whoever is supporting us. Many people came to us and helped a lot,” said Gayatri. She further said, “Congressmen had come to my house a couple of days ago. They had made me speak to their leaders on the phone in Lucknow. They had offered me to contest elections, but I refused.” She said that not only Congressmen, but also the people of SP and BSP had contacted her and told her that they wanted to meet and field her in the election.Amit Pandey, president of Congress Kanpur Nagar (Rural), said, “Congress people had contacted mother of Amar’s widow to contest the elections, but she refused to contest saying she is reeling under mental agony as her widow-daughter is in jail and that she is not in a position to contest election right now.” Meanwhile, in a dramatic turn of events on Monday, Gayatri, a resident of Ratanpur Panki, was called to the office of former SP city general secretary Varun Mishra in Kamla Nagar, where SP leader Major Ashish Chaturvedi offered her a ticket from Govindnagar. Gayatri told media persons, “As of now, getting justice for my daughter is my priority. I do not want to contest the elections, but now SP leaders have assured me that my daughter will be out of jail within a month of the formation of the government, so I am ready to contest," said Gayatri further. To recall, on the night of July 2, 2020, a police team that went to raid the house of the gangster Vikas Dubey in Bikru was attacked by the latter and his aides in the village. Eight policemen, including the then CO of Bilhaur, Devendra Mishra, were killed by Dubey and his aides in the attack.Later, in back-to-back encounters police had killed six accused including Vikas Dubey and his five alleged aides. Also, about 50 people were arrested by the police and sent to jail. Among those arrested by the police included slain Amar Dubey’s minor wife.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kanpur/oppn-woos-kin-of-bikru-case-accused-to-breach-brahmin-votes/articleshow/89103129.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

---||Delhi||Delhi: Why makeover of Meharchand market seems a bridge too far||NEW DELHI: The redevelopment of the Meharchand market has hit a roadblock due to lack of clarity over extension of shops on upper floors that would cover the common area. South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) had in November 2020 approved the standard facade control drawing of the market, enhancing the floor area ratio (FAR) from 100 to 350. While traders were allowed to construct the basement, ground, first and second floors, the civic body didn’t permit extension on the upper floors. “Last year, the shopkeepers submitted a fresh proposal requesting the corporation to incorporate the verandah in the shop area on upper floors,” said Lt Col BK Oberoi (retd), chairman, standing committee. The shopkeepers even agreed to pay for the common verandah in front of their shops, in addition to costs for additional FAR, provided they are allowed to make extensions on the first and second floors. SDMC then prepared a fresh drawing and forwarded it to the town planning department. The proposal will be presented at the next meeting of the standing committee on January 28. However, Oberoi pointed out, there is confusion over whether the common verandah is part of the main road or provided for access to the general public. “The town planning department has been asked to verify details with the original plan. If the 8-foot-wide verandah is part of the road, we can’t provide the space to shopkeepers for personal use,” he said. He added that a meeting will be held with traders before the project is tabled in the standing committee meet. “We want all the buildings in the market to look similar. Since the construction and augmentation costs will be borne by traders, we will ask them about their preparation and plans,” said Oberoi. The key commercial hub of Meharchand Market is located near Lodhi Colony. As per the approved plan, all existing structures were to be demolished to make way for new buildings, with the entire cost of redevelopment to be borne by traders. It was also planned to be declared a “pedestrian shopping street” due to unavailability of parking facilities.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/why-makeover-of-meharchand-market-seems-a-bridge-too-far/articleshow/89101886.cms||Vibha Sharma

At the time of the incident, the victim was around 15-year-old.Keeping in mind the facts and circumstances and seriousness of the offence and without making any comment on merits of the case, there were not sufficient grounds for bail. Hence, the bail application of accused Rajeev Kumar was being rejected, the court observed in its order.The victim in her statement stated that Rajeev’s aunt had called her on August 21,2018 at her room and asked to clean it. After cleaning while she was leaving the room, Rajeev came in and physically exploited her. When she reported the incident at the police station, he threatened her of dire consequences and forced her to withdraw the report.According to ADGC Sushil Kumar, in the meantime, Rajeev had called four other cops who thrashed her father so badly that his hand got fractured and his brother became impotent after they hit his genitals.

As he has been in the jail since January, 5,2022, and has no criminal history, therefore, he should be released on bail.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kanpur/pocso-court-rejects-bail-plea-of-rape-accused/articleshow/89103136.cms||---

In a multi-cornered contest, where the winning margins are expected to be thin and every mandate counts, these votes are a potential game changer.Along with the octogenarians, the defence personnel and people with disabilities (PWDs) will also use the postal ballot method of voting. Those in the defence services can fill a form online for using the facility, while the PWDs have to produce a certificate of disability. Ludhiana has 58,946 voters in the 80-plus age group, 5,168 in the defence category, and 10,766 in the PWD segment. Officials involved in the postal ballot process claim that it will be a challenge for the polling staff to conduct voting through this system because first they must take ballot papers to the prospective voters and then carry these back for counting. One of the officials claimed that in Punjab’s new political situation, where the coming in of new parties such as the Punjab Lok Congress (PLC) and the Sanyukt Samaj Morcha (SSM) had made the assembly elections a multi-cornered contest and the winning margins were expected to be thin, postal ballots could be the game changer.He said: “Earlier we used to depute our staff to bring the senior voters to the polling stations but, this time, more elderly residents are expected to use the postal ballot facility.” Confirming the move, a senior officer in the district administration said: “The block-level officers (BLOs) have the responsibility of getting in touch with the voters who are aged 80-plus and can’t reach the polling station because of health-related issues. They will be offered the postal ballot service.”The senior officer in the district administation also said that even the voters who were down with Covid-19 and spending time in quarantine will also get a chance to vote by postal ballot, as the Election Commission of India had instructed the administration not to deny even a single voter his or her right to vote.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/postal-ballot-potential-game-changer-in-punjabs-multi-cornered-contest/articleshow/89103138.cms||---

They reported a shortage of manpower in the PSPCL offices of their areas, claiming that it was delaying the resolution of complaints. The dozen-odd businessmen from micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) also discussed various other issues with the chief engineer during this meeting. Daba Road Small Scale Manufacturers Association president Amarjit Singh Chauhan said: "The factories of Giaspura, Daba Road and Industrial Area C work round the clock. Their count has increased but the strength of the PSPCL staff deployed to serve them remains unchanged."He said: "Be it night, hot weather, extreme cold, or rain, the production in these factories never stops. For the past some time, the number of staff stationed at the PSPCL offices catering to these areas has not increased in the same proportion as the factories. This is leading to a situation where each PSPCL staffer has to attend to a huge number of complaints and therefore the resolution of these matters takes a lot of time."Chauhan said: "Even for a few minutes of power outage costs the factories lakhs of rupees, therefore, this problem needs to addressed at the earliest. Our association met PSPCL chief engineer Jasveer Singh Bhullar to apprise him of this issue and demand that the staff strength be increased. Bhullar has assured us of a solution and shared with us that he was about to introduce a system of periodic meetings with businessmen to understand and resolve their issues." Another local businessman Paramdeep Singh Sohal said: "We also reported lose wires, dislocation of poles, and the conditions due to which the power supply is erratic.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/pspcl-staff-crisis-delaying-redress-industrialists-inform-chief-engineer/articleshow/89103140.cms||---
---||Ludhiana||Ludhiana’s little UP aspires for roads, schools, water||Ludhiana: Development is the main election issue in the Punjab assembly constituency of Ludhiana South, where Uttar Pradesh and Bihar natives form the voting majority.Balwinder Singh Bains of the Lok Insaf Party (LIP) has won the seat twice in a row. Between 1977 and 2007, Ludhiana South was part of the Ludhiana rural assembly segment, but from 1957 and 1972, it was a separate constituency, while in the 1951 elections, it was called the Ludhiana City South segment. In 2017, Bains defeated Bhupinder Singh Sidhu of the Congress by 30,917 votes. Bains polled 53,955 votes, while his nearest rival secured 23,038 mandates. Hira Singh Gabria of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) finished at the third spot with a total vote figure of 20,554. For the election that is due next month, many voters had picked development as the main issue in the constituency. The state of roads and parks hurts them the most. Data from the 2017 elections suggests that of the 1,49,582 total electors in the assembly segment, 1,01,713 had come out to vote, making a voting percentage of 68%.Voter Muhammad Tamane of Giaspura, who belongs to Sitamarhi in Bihar originally, complained that roads in the constituency were damaged because these routes got waterlogged very easily. He said: "Garbage clearance is irregular and there’s a general lack of development innthe constituency. We have a park that remains logged with sewage and wastewater mostly, because of which it stays out of use." Parveen Kumar, a voter from Sherpur in Uttar Pradesh originally, said: “The local legislator is proactive but the problems remain unsolved. The residents want better infrastructure, roads, sewerage, and educational facilities.”AAP candidate Rajinder Pal Kaur claimed that the constituency’s roads, streets, and sewerage system were in a worst condition and the constituents didn’t have access to clean drinking water. She said: “Instead they get yellow tap water, which is unfit for drinking. There are also no schools, colleges, or dispensaries in the segment. Besides, there are supply of electricity is irregular and there is no proper street lighting. If elected, I will work on creating these basic facilities.Sitting MLA Balwinder Singh Bains said: “We have a proper sewerage system in the constituency and the problem of water accumulation has been solved to a large extent. In my tenure, the roads were repaired every year. Building a government college for girls in the constituency is now on my agenda, so that they no longer have to travel long distance to the city for education. For me, education is development.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/ludhianas-little-up-aspires-for-roads-schools-water/articleshow/89103141.cms||Shariq Majeed

The party is yet to field anyone from Ludhiana South, Gill, and Sahnewal, leaving the aspiring contenders high and dry.Because of no clarity yet on who will get the ticket, the candidates haven’t even started campaigning, lest they get embarrassed in case they don’t get the party’s favour. However, they have started with social-media campaigns in support of their claim for ticket. On condition of anonymity, a Congress ticket aspirant from Ludhiana South said: “Only 25 days are left for the February 20 elections and almost all the major parties have announced their candidates for all seats of Ludhiana. The nominations start tomorrow, but we have no name yet for South, Gill, Sahnewal and even Jagraon.”The aspirant said that the longer the high command will take for announcing the names, the more trouble it will be for those who will be finalised, because they will get very less time for campaigning. He said: “We request the high command to cause no further delay and declare candidates by tomorrow under any circumstances.”A Congressman who has applied for ticket from Sahnewal said: “The 2022 elections are very different from the earlier polls in the country because of the Covid-19 restrictions. The campaigning methods will have to be altered accordingly, which needs more planning and time. Our rivals have a head start over us, as they have launched their campaigns and contacted an huge number of voters already.

Doctors generally prescribe medicines based on the narrated experience of the patient, which I felt was unscientific. Medications should be based on measurement of tremors,” said Jui (15). She learnt python online and had a prototype ready within eight months. “These involuntary tremors start in the limbs of a patient and I thought why not make a glove with the device attached, so that it is easier to detect them. That is how I came to the final model named JTremor 3D. J stands for Jui and 3D because it measures the tremors in 3D,” said Jui .“I am working on making the device more accurate and compact and trying to obtain approvals to conduct clinical trials,” she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/city-girl-wins-rashtriya-bal-puraskar-for-parkinsons-tremor-measurement-device/articleshow/89103156.cms||Ardhra Nair

The Congress party must think about it,” he said, adding that Patole’s recent statements about the Prime Minister and the Union home minister were highly condemnable. “The usage of words in the chief minister’s speech on Sunday were also very unbecoming. It did not suit his stature,” Patil said. He said BJP members were meeting the governor frequently because of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray not being available and failing to run the government properly. “Shiv Sena is now talking about Hindutva because they have performed very poorly on all fronts as the ruling party. Sena should vehemently tell Congress, and not BJP, that it still preaches Hindutva. Sena should tell the minority communities, whom it is appeasing now, that it has not left Hindutva,” he said. Patil said Shiv Sena was trying to blame its loss in Nagarpanchayat polls on factors like “contesting on less number of seats” or “backstabbing by alliance partners”, but it would not help the party in saving its face because it could not get even a single seat in 43 Nagarpanchayats. He said the parties or leaders who had not done anything wrong had nothing to fear about ED or CBI. “Are leaders like Anil Deshmukh in jail without reason? Have leaders like Sanjay Rathod resigned for no reason?” Patil said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/patil-patoles-remarks-not-in-sync-with-maha-political-culture/articleshow/89103160.cms||---

---||Pune||Pune: Career needs fuel midway subject switch by students||PUNE: A careful look at the form filling data for the semester examinations being conducted by the Savitribai Phule Pune University from February shows that students have switched subjects in the first and second years especially in the humanities stream. Officials who scrutinised the data said it was a reflection of the times. With more students with a will to explore, and with colleges becoming more relaxed about their structures due to online classes coupled with their adoption of choice based credit system, students are able to choose from a wide variety of options now, principals said. V B Gaikwad, principal of KTHM College, Nashik, said that his college has seen this trend in the undergraduate level and not at the master’s level. “There is a big change among students now. Many students have opted for English even though they had not done so in their first term. Then there are cases of a complete change of subjects too. This is not limited to humanities, though the highest numbers are there, but also in the science stream. We have students who had chosen chemistry in first year of their under graduate studies and then picked something totally different in their second year. The online education, the choice based credit system allow such transfers,” Gaikwad said. Sahil Alhat, a second-year BA student, said that he had taken political science in the first year which he dropped in second year and took optional English. “When I was enrolling in BA, I was fresh out of school and didn't know much about the subjects to choose from, the jobs available or what I wanted to do. Now I want to try for MPSC and UPSC exams and I want to specialise in English in my BA final year so that I can take English as my optional subject in the competitive exams. Hence I dropped one of my subjects and added a new subject,” he added. Anshara Shaikh, a final year student of geology had not chosen the subject at all when she enrolled in her first year of graduation. “I was not very aware about the difference between geography and geology and I was also told by some people that both are almost the same. I took admission, only to realise that both the subjects are very different. When I tried to change my subject, I was told that I cannot do it. That is when I came to know that there was a provision to add subjects, which very few people know and colleges do not advertise. I changed my college and added geology as a subject and now in my third year, I am specializing in in as I want to become a hydrogeologist,” she said. Rajendra Zunjarrao, principal of Modern College of Arts, Commerce and Science, said that students are more aggressively pursuing what they want now, which was not the case a few years ago. “The earlier generations also wished to change subjects or add subjects. But there was a fear of actually approaching the principal or the university with such demands because it was widely believed that such changes cannot happen once you have taken admission. But now, students are aggressively pursuing what they think is right, which is a good sign,” said Zunjarrao. “While it is common in graduation, I have someone who changed his mind in postgraduation. He completed his first term in MA Marathi, realized he doesn’t like it and now has taken up history. So, he also has to appear for all term I exams of MA History,” Zunjarrao said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/career-needs-fuel-midway-subject-switch-by-students/articleshow/89103164.cms||Ardhra Nair

The objective is to prevent the recurrence of such accidents. “We are installing chain fencing for some metres and will also put an iron gate at the entrance of the quarry to restrict access to people. So far, we have completed digging pits for iron poles to support the chain fencing. Work will be completed in a fortnight,” Pradip Sankpal, range forest officer, told TOI. According to forest officials, the hill is the habitat of wild animals like Indian foxes and jungle cats. The sighting of birds like peacocks is also very common. However, the decision to install fencing has not gone down well with regular walkers, visitors, and members of the Deccan Gymkhana Parisar Samiti. They said the forest fauna will not be able to access the natural water source. They believe the authorities should have opted for natural green fencing, planting trees and bushes. Sushma Date, a regular visitor and member of the Samiti, said the accident was unfortunate, adding, “But not many mishaps of this kind take place here. The forest department can keep a guard for 12 hours to restrict people from going to the quarry. It will maintain ecological balance on the hill.” Rahul Patil, deputy conservator of forest, Pune division, said, “We have taken all views into account. If people are not satisfied, we will talk to them again to address their concerns. The safety of visitors is also important.” Watch Pune: Forest department begins fencing open quarry after a youth fell down||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/forest-dept-begins-fencing-open-quarry-at-vetal-tekdi/articleshow/89103165.cms||---

---||Pune||Hazare takes up sugar units’ issue with Shah||Pune: Social crusader Anna Hazare has written to Union cooperation minister Amit Shah for setting up of a high-powered committee under the chairmanship of a retired Supreme Court judge to conduct an inquiry into the alleged irregularities worth Rs25,000crore in selling and functioning of cooperative sugar factories in the state. In the letter, Hazare claimed involvement of political leaders and government officers in selling of sugar cooperatives to private entities. He sought “a transparent inquiry” to protect the cooperative sector from privatisation.“Despite efforts by the Centre to revive the cooperative sugar factories, 47 such factories have been sold to private players. These factories faced a burden of illegal loans created by their director boards. Hence, it appears that the financial conditions of these factories were deliberately weakened and finally these entities were sold at low prices. The entire process should be termed as betrayal and forgery as illegal practices were involved,” Hazare said in the letter.He alleged that the politicians involved “are trying to finish off the cooperative movement and support privatisation”. The farmers had contributed to the establishments of those factories by purchasing shares, but they did not receive any returns, he said.Hazare said permissions had been given to the new factories, though the state’s sugar production capacity is limited to 7 crore tonnes. “The permission has been issued to the factories, which hold a total crushing capacity of 9.3 crore tonnes. The Union agriculture minister, food and civil supplies minister and secretaries of the associated departments are responsible for issuing the letter of intention to commence new factories,” Hazare said in the letter.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/hazare-takes-up-sugar-units-issue-with-shah/articleshow/89103168.cms||---

---||Pune||Save for daughters’ education, rural postal dept tells parents||Pune: Celebrating National Girls’ Day on January 24, the Pune rural postal department is running a week-long campaign to encourage citizens to invest in their daughters’ education. Employees of post offices (POs) in the city and rural areas of the district have appealed to parents to visit their nearest PO and open a Sukanya Samriddhi account for girls below the age of 10 years. A dry account can be opened by paying a minimum of Rs250 or maximum of Rs1.5 lakh at any PO, and can be dissolved by the girl in whose name it was set up for higher education after the age of 18. This national scheme — launched in 2015 as a part of the Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao campaign — provides an interest rate of 7.6% and is eligible for tax benefits. BP Erande, Superintendent of Post Offices, Pune Rural, told TOI, “Parents often save money for a daughter’s wedding, not her further education. If parents make a provision for their daughter’s higher studies when she is younger, there will be enough time for even a small investment to gather compound interest and mature, providing her with financial backup.” He said, “We also provide fast-track processing of documents such as the child’s Aadhaar card, as long as the parents can produce her birth certificate. Either of the parents’ Aadhaar and PAN card are required for opening the account, with the child’s name.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/save-for-daughters-education-rural-postal-dept-tells-parents/articleshow/89103173.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

Such an occurrence is usually followed by a drop in minimum temperature due to clear sky conditions over North India, even areas of Maharashtra. Hence, a drop in night temperature in parts of Maharashtra is also expected during the next few days,” Kashyapi said. Maximum temperatures in Pune in the last two days have been below 25C, while night temperatures have been on the higher side due to partly cloudy sky conditions. On Sunday, minimum temperature recorded at all the IMD locations in Pune ranged from 17-19C. In Shivajinagar, the minimum temperature on Sunday stood at 17.2C.

As many as 97.61 lakh beneficiaries have not taken their second dose of Covishield despite becoming eligible for it, while 17.32 lakh have skirted their second shot of Covaxin.The long second dose due list has become a major concern of the state government in the wake of the rising Covid cases in Maharashtra. The state immunisation officials claimed that they had made considerable efforts to create awareness about the vaccines and reached homes in every district to bring out people for the second dose, but the results had not been satisfactory.“We have been repeatedly drawing up the list of the beneficiaries due for the second shot and sharing it with the districts concerned. It is up to the districts to take its cognisance and follow up with the beneficiaries through their nodal officers,” said a senior official of the state health department.Pune, Nashik, Thane, Mumbai and Nagpur have the highest number of beneficiaries missing their second dose of Covishield. Buldhana, Amravati, Washim, Yavatmal and Nanded have the largest number of people due for the second shot of Covaxin.Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar had on Saturday said though the state had not made it mandatory, the government’s intention was to ensure that all the beneficiaries took both the doses of Covid vaccines. He had said one should understand that s/he cannot pose risk to others by not getting fully vaccinated and the state administration would continue to reach out to such people.An average of 3-5 lakh beneficiaries were being vaccinated in a day in the state in the last 10 days — a big drop from 8-9 lakh daily vaccinations last month. The first dose vaccination coverage in the state is above 90%. It is 66% for the second shot.The state immunisation officer, Dr Sachin Desai, said the state had so far utilised 1.5 crore doses of Covid vaccines. He also said the state had nearly 1 crore pending doses of Covishield and 20 lakh doses of Covaxin, which should suffice till the end of this month.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/more-than-1cr-people-delay-2nd-dose-govt-concerned/articleshow/89103179.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Rajat Kher, a financial analyst, said, “We had decided to postpone the celebrations till the situation normalised and the restrictions guest count and timings were lifted. But to our bad luck, we are back to square one this year.” Many couples also find themselves in a financial bind because the event venues and services, for which they had paid in advance, were unwilling to cancel bookings without charging a heavy fee. “After we booked a marriage hall, we were told that only 100 guests will be allowed. We wanted to cancel it and arrange it at our own house. But the marriage hall operator denied return of the deposit. We had no option but to reschedule the date of the event,” said Shobha Thorat, who works in the hospitality sector. Employee at a marriage hall in Katraj confirmed that over one-third of the bookings had been rescheduled, while one-third modified their dates. “This year, clients have found a work around where they have booked the entire venue — indoor and outdoor. At some locations, they have booked all the halls to accommodate more guests that came with the surge pricing.” Rounak Sethi, founder of a wedding management firm, said many couples were getting their marriage legally registered, but were postponing the celebrations. “The marriage registry office is easily witnessing over twice the number of applicants as against the pre-pandemic times. Some couples are getting their marriages registered, but are rescheduling celebrations,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/pandemic-plays-spoilsport-for-couples-this-year-too/articleshow/89103182.cms||Anjali Jhangiani
