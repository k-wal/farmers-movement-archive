The spurt in terror activities by hybrid terrorists — unknown or unidentified terrorists not featuring in police records — in Srinagar since last year, including attacks on cops and civilians, prompted the UT police to suggest the move. The five Srinagar localities that will get new police stations are Ahmednagar, Sangam (Eidgah) downtown, Bemina, Shalteng and Chanapora, said a senior police officer. Two new police posts will be set up in Srinagar’s Tengpora (under Batamaloo PS) and Khimber (under Zakoora PS). The police post in Budgam will come up at Mouchwa (under Chadoora PS), the officer added. Besides upgrading their network, this will help J&K Police reach citizens at their doorsteps and curb crime in these localities. “Residents of these areas had to travel long distances to file complaints and for redressal of their grievances. It was their long-pending demand to have police stations in close proximity,” said a source. Meanwhile, intelligence agencies have suggested transferring several SHOs over their alleged involvement in corruption, claiming that the officers have not put enough effort into investigating hybrid terrorists in their respective jurisdictions.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/srinagar-to-get-5-new-police-stations-2-police-posts/articleshow/88653474.cms||M Saleem Pandit

The board also decided to give an additional Rs 5 lakh to each dead pilgrim’s family, apart from an ex gratia of Rs 10 lakh announced on Saturday. The main prongs of the proposed safety programme are 100% online booking of the yatra, crowd control through RFID tagging, separation of entry and exit routes in the temple, decongestion of the entire 12km mountain trail from the base camp of Katra to the shrine located at a height of 5,200ft. Experts will be contracted to suggest infrastructure designs, logistics and best crowd management practices. These decisions were taken at a special meeting of the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board that was chaired by Lt Governor Manoj Sinha at Raj Bhavan. The LG, who is also the shrine board’s chairman, reviewed the factors that could have triggered the crowd surge and deadly stampede. Board CEO Ramesh Kumar said 35,000 pilgrims were allowed to on December 31 and January 1 as against the National Green Tribunal’s cap of 50,000 a day, keeping in view the pandemic. The CEO was asked to consider resuming the token/group number system discontinued six years ago. The LG pushed for appropriate use of technology such as RFID tracking system for crowd control, particularly in and around the Bhawan—the space in the temple complex that houses the sanctum sanctorum or the sacred, natural “pindies”. The board directed the CEO to implement the master plan for the Bhawan area in phases but strictly within timelines. Safety audit of infrastructure within the temple complex was also discussed. The board suggested building a suspension bridge or a skywalk for managing queues and identifying open spaces that can hold large crowds near the Bhawan and in Katra. It explored options for connecting the shrine with Katra through a ropeway for the aged and infirm.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/vaishno-devi-board-to-step-up-crowd-control-safety-systems-post-stampede/articleshow/88653481.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

Slain terrorist Mohammed Shabbir Malik was carrying an AK-47, seven grenades, ammunition, ration suited for a long haul in cold weather, certificates and a photo that showed him in army uniform with the name tab. “This was a BAT action,” an Army officer said, underscoring that it was clearly a “complete breach of the ceasefire understanding” between the two nations. The Pakistan Army has been contacted and asked to take the body. BAT comprises military regulars and mercenaries from terrorist groups such as Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). They carry out surprise attacks on Indian positions along the LoC. On New Year’s Day, Army stakeout along the LoC spotted the terrorist in a Pathani suit and black jacket. Armed with an AK-47 assault rifle, he was trying to break into India through the anti-infiltration obstacle system across the border. Ambushes were laid along routes the intruder was likely to take and he eventually fell into one. The route he took was similar to the one taken by infiltrators “on April 4, 2020, during Operation Rangadori Bhaikh in which five terrorists were eliminated,” the Army said in a statement. The Army could make out that it was a BAT operation as a “search of the belongings revealed Pakistani identity card and vaccination certificates (issued by ministry of national health services regulation and coordination of Pakistan) that identified him as Mohammed Shabir Malik. The belongings also include a photo of the infiltrator in army uniform wearing the name tab of Shabbir.” This “establishes that Pakistan continues to sponsor cross-border militancy”, the Army said. In another anti-terrorism operation, J&K Police said a terrorist was killed by security forces along the LoC in the Jumagund area of Kupwara district on Saturday. His identity is not yet known.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/bat-action-foiled-pakistani-terrorist-killed-on-loc-in-jk/articleshow/88654110.cms||M Saleem Pandit

---||Mumbai||Miffed at missing kin’s funeral, British Indian calls +ve Covid test a ‘scam’ in FB live from Mumbai airport||LONDON: A British Indian man’s Facebook live video claiming that his positive PCR test at Mumbai international airport was a “scam” which caused him to miss his father-in-law’s funeral has gone viral attracting thousands of viewers worldwide. Manoj Ladwa, 54, born in Porbandar, Gujarat, who now lives in Staines in Britain, where he is director of a construction company, is now in a Covid ward at Seven Hills Hospital in Andheri, despite having initially told staff at Mumbai international airport he would not go there since he had no Covid symptoms and had tested negative before the flight. According to Ladwa, the BMC staff refused to let him have a second PCR test carried out in front of him and after a nine-hour stand-off at the airport with 14 other passengers who tested positive from the same Virgin Atlantic flight, he was eventually taken there. His wife tested negative at the airport and went to the funeral alone. The flight tickets for him and his wife cost £3,000 (approx Rs 3 lakh). The BMC officials, on their part, said that they are following the Covid-19 testing norms as laid down by the state government and civic agency. As per the norms, passengers arriving from countries identified by the government as ‘at-risk’ such as those in Europe including the United Kingdom, are deboarded on priority to undergo RT-PCR test on arrival. “If this sample is also positive then the collected sample for routine RT-PCR shall be sent immediately for genome sequencing and the passenger shall be directed for institutional quarantine. If sample is negative, the passenger shall be allowed to go home for mandatory home quarantine for a total period of 7 days. All symptomatic passengers testing positive at the airport are admitted at Seven Hills Hospital. Any such patient preferring admission in a private hospital can be transferred to Bombay Hospital or Breach Candy Hospital,” a BMC circular said. When the airport authorities refused to carry out a second PCR test, Ladwa started an angry Facebook Live from the airport which has been seen by more than 50,000 people worldwide. In the video he claims he has “magically tested positive” at Mumbai international airport and begs viewers to “speak to anyone they know who can help”. “This is a scam,” he declared. “My wife’s father died 24 hours ago and I am here to get to his funeral. They are denying me an independent test.” Some viewers mistook him for Manoj Ladwa, former communications director for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who also lives in the UK. “It is not the first time I have been mixed up with him,” Ladwa said, speaking to TOI from the hospital ward. “Nobody was prepared to be ferried off to an unknown quarantine hospital where they didn’t know what was going to happen and so we all took a stand and that is when people from BMC turned up and said they were going to raise a case against us, if we did not go into mandatory quarantine,” he said. Ladwa and his wife Sharmili had departed Heathrow on December 29 to attend her father’s funeral in Borivali. Vasant Parikh, 87, had died of lung cancer on December 28. Ladwa booked flights the same day and they both had a PCR test before flying which was negative. The flight landed in Mumbai at 1.30am on December 30 and they had to get to Borivali by 8am for the funeral. Ladwa said there was “mayhem” on arrival at the airport and the PCR tests were carried out in a corridor where other passengers were coming off planes. “The desk where I had my test done had many other test kits on, there was no segregation and the previous person who left seconds before, their cotton bud was placed on top of mine, and then man doing the test, then moved it and picked mine up,” he said, claiming his test may have been cross-contaminated with Covid. “I carried out a lateral flow test in front of officials at the airport which came out negative. I gave two to two passengers and they tested negative. I asked to have another an independent PCR test and they refused.” At 5am, he told his wife to go ahead to the funeral without him. Now stuck in quarantine, he fears he will miss his return flight back booked on January 4 and has contacted his MP Kwasi Kwarteng asking for help. “I have not shown any symptoms from the minute I got ready to board the plane,” he said, adding if he picks up Covid anywhere, it will be at the hospital he is in. “I would have liked the honour of being equivalent of pall bearer and getting my father-in-law prepared – none of that happened. This trip has been destroyed by this,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/miffed-at-missing-kins-funeral-british-indian-calls-ve-covid-test-a-scam-in-fb-live-from-mumbai-airport/articleshow/88653515.cms||NAOMI CANTON

India recorded nearly 1.3 lakh fresh cases during the week (December 27-January 2) — a 12-week high — as compared with the previous week's tally of 46,073, which ironically was the lowest since the middle of May 2020. This was by far the sharpest weekly surge in infections since the beginning of the pandemic in the country. The previous highest increase was 71% recorded during the second wave in April 5-11, 2021. On Sunday, 33,703 fresh cases of the coronavirus were detected across the country (with two states yet to report), another 21% rise from the previous day's count of 27,747, as per TOI’s Covid database. Sunday's tally was five times the number of cases recorded in the country last Sunday (6,542). Such a steep increase is consistent with reports of Omicron's spread in other countries, although the percentage of people being infected with the new variant is yet to be properly estimated. This week’s tally of cases was also the highest seen in India since October 4-10, nearly three months ago, when 1.37 lakh infections were reported. Read Also3,194 new Covid cases in Delhi, positivity nears 5%Delhi recorded 3,194 new Covid-19 cases on Saturday, with a test positivity rate of 4.59%, the highest single-day spike in cases since May 20. It was the ninth consecutive day of tallies not seen since May or June.The biggest surge in numbers was reported in Maharashtra, which logged 41,980 cases during the week, close to the count reported from the entire country in the preceding week. This week's tally in Maharashtra was five times higher than the state's numbers in the previous week (8,292). Bihar reported the highest weekly percentage increase, with cases going from 85 in the December 20-26 week to 1,073, a 12-fold rise although the absolute numbers were low as yet. Bengal recorded the second highest weekly number of cases at 18,524, up more than five times the previous week's tally of 3,550. Delhi registered a nine-fold surge with 10,769 fresh cases in the week, up from 1,155 in the previous seven days. Jharkhand numbers also leaped by nearly nine times to 2,879, from 326. Read AlsoRamp up vaccine coverage: Centre to poll-bound statesIn a high-level meeting with states on Sunday, health minister Mansukh Mandaviya asked states to leave no stone unturned in ramping up infrastructure to manage a surge, the health ministry said in a statement.Other states where this week's cases were at least five times higher than the preceding one included Gujarat (4,410 cases), Uttar Pradesh (1,617), Rajasthan (1,403), Chhattisgarh (1,133) and Haryana (2,285). Overall, weekly cases rose in 30 out of 36 states/Union territories, another statistic that points to the surge now turning into a wave. A notable exception to the rise was Kerala, where numbers dropped by 1% this week. However, the significant slowing down of the decline this week could be a precursor to cases rising in the southern state as well. Meanwhile, India recorded 1,897 deaths during the week, a decline of 22% from the previous week's toll of 2,441. However, a majority of the fatalities recorded in the past several weeks are old deaths that are being added to the records now, mainly by Kerala.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/coronavirus-indias-weekly-cases-up-nearly-3-fold-in-highest-ever-surge/articleshow/88653938.cms||Amit Bhattacharya
---||India||Retain Rs 8 lakh EWS cap for admissions, recommends panel||NEW DELHI: The committee set up to evaluate the Rs 8 lakh income limit for the economically weaker section candidates in admissions to educational institutions had recommended retention of the qualifying mark and with the Centre informing the Supreme Court that it accepts the reasoning, the stage might be set for resumption of the counselling process for the NEET-PG seats that have been currently held up. The Centre on Sunday told the Supreme Court that it would stick to the Rs 8 lakh annual income limit criteria that entitles EWS candidates to a 10% reservation in admissions to educational institutions, including medical colleges, and government jobs, but promised to tweak other EWS- related criteria a bit from next year. The committee advised implementation of its recommendations from next year, which would mean the EWS quota admissions for medical admissions for the present academic year, which is yet to be completed, would be on the basis of the 2019 criteria. The committee said, “The existing system, which is going on since 2019, if disturbed at the end or fag-end of the process would create more complications than expected both for the beneficiaries as well as for the authorities.” Answering the court’s questions on justification of the Rs 8 lakh limit, the committee said, “The annual household income distribution of qualified EWS candidates for NEET-UG and JEE (Mains) for 2020 reveals that a mere 9% and 8.2% of EWS candidates were found to be in the income bracket Rs 5-8 lakhs, respectively. In other words, most selected candidates who got the benefit of EWS reservation had annual family income lower than Rs 5 lakh. That is why the committee has come to the conclusion that the existing annual income criteria of Rs 8 lakh is not over-inclusive." The government said it has accepted the Ajay Bhushan Pandey committee report, which recommended continuance of Rs 8 lakh income limit with riders after a detailed analysis of the criteria. Seeking to respond to the court’s queries, the committee differentiated it from the income criteria adopted to disentitle creamy layer among OBCs for quotas. The committee, comprising former finance secretary Pandey, Prof V K Malhotra of ICSSR and principal economic adviser to the government Sanjeev Sanyal, was set up on November 30 and submitted its report to the government on December 31 after eight meetings. The committee said that the “EWS may, however exclude, irrespective of income, a person whose family has 5 acres of agricultural land and above (as was included in the 2019 criteria which was challenged in the SC).” The change from the 2019 EWS norms would be exclusion of residential assets criteria which was found to be difficult to collate and verify and a compliance burden. The residential asset criteria had drawn serious objections from the SC on the ground that the value of a residential asset varies substantially between urban and rural areas and even within big cities like Mumbai according to the location of the residential property. Read AlsoGovt agreed to review Rs 8L income cap over fear Supreme Court might scrap EWS quotaNEW DELHI: The fear that 10% reservation for the Economically Weaker Sections as a whole may be scrapped by the Supreme Court led to the Centre tamely submitting that it will review the eligibility income ceiling of Rs 8 lakh for the quota catering to mostly the upper castes. While the Supreme CourtThe Centre had set up the committee to revisit 2019 EWS criteria after an SC bench headed by Justices D Y Chandrachud on October 7 remarked, “Economic backwardness is a realistic thing. There is no doubt about it as people don’t have money to purchase books, to even have food. But as far as the EWS is concerned, they are forward class and there is no social or educational backwardness among them. So can you apply the same yardstick of Rs 8 lakh limit for the creamy layer to the EWS? Please remember, with regard to the EWS we are not dealing with social and educational backwardness. What was the basis of fixing the limit or have you simply lifted the criteria for the creamy layer and put it for EWS.” The committee has pointed out that the Rs 8 lakh limit includes all family income, including from agriculture sources making the exercise stricter than in case of OBC quotas. The committee said, “The current gross annual family income limit for EWS of Rs 8 lakh or less may be retained. In other words only those families whose annual income is upto Rs 8 lakh would be eligible to get the benefit of EWS reservation. The definition of ‘family’ and income would remain the same as those in the office memorandum of January 17, 2019.” In the case of admissions to educational institutions, sudden adoption of a new criteria inevitably and necessarily would delay the process by several months, which would have an inevitable cascading effect on all future admissions and educational activities/teaching/examination, which are time bound under various statutory/judicial prescriptions, it said. The committee also suggested a three-year loop cycle monitoring of implementation of new criteria suggested by it for effecting required corrections in future. Read AlsoA third of private school seats for poor not taken in Delhi in year gone byNEW DELHI: The pandemic caused a slowdown in the admission of students from the economically weaker sections (EWS) and disadvantaged group (DG), for whom 25% of the seats are reserved in private schools across the country. While different states follow different admission timelines, a reportExamining in detail the issue raised by the SC: whether an annual family income of Rs 8 lakh is too high as a cut-off for identifying the EWS, and whether or not it was mechanically adopting a number because it was also used for the OBC creamy layer, the committee found that though the specific number of Rs 8 lakh appears to be the same as the OBC creamy layer cut-off, the application of the cut-off is very different in EWS and OBC as the two have different contexts. “The income criterion for the EWS is much more stringent than the one for the OBC creamy layer. First, the EWS’s criteria relates to the financial year prior to the year of application whereas the income criterion for the creamy layer in OBC category is applicable to gross annual income for three consecutive years. Secondly, in case of deciding the OBC creamy layer, income from salaries, agriculture and traditional artisanal professions are excluded from the consideration whereas the Rs 8 lakh criteria for EWS includes that from all sources, including farming. So, despite being the same cut-off number, their composition is different and hence, the two cannot be equated,” it reasoned. Further, under EWS reservation, the definition of family income includes the incomes of the candidate, his/her parents, his/her under-18 siblings, his/her spouse, and children below the age of 18 years. “This in other words means that income of three generations are included in the family income for EWS purposes. The EWS income criteria also includes agricultural income that does not attract income tax. This must be kept in mind when comparing the EWS income criteria with income tax slabs,” it said. Read AlsoWill review Rs 8 lakh income criteria for EWS for reservation in NEET: Centre to SCThe central government on Thursday told the Supreme Court that it has decided to revisit the criteria for determining economically weaker section (EWS) for getting the benefit reservation in view of court raising question on rationality of fixing Rs 8 lakh annual income limit for EWS.The Pandey committee report said, “As per current income tax norms, the effective income tax on individuals is zero for those with annual incomes up to Rs 5 lakh. After taking advantage of the various provisions for deductions, savings, insurance etc., the taxpayer may not need to pay any tax up to an annual income of Rs 7-8 lakh. Thus, the EWS cut-off of Rs 8 lakh, if applied to just an individual, is in the ballpark of income tax requirements for zero tax liability. Once applied to include family income and farm income, however, it becomes much more demanding as compared to the individual income tax exemption limit," it explained. Agreeing with the SC reservations against residential asset criteria specified in the 2019 norms, the committee said it was of the view that “on merit as well as for ease, convenience, and simplicity, the residential asset area criteria should altogether be omitted as it does not reflect true economic conditions and also poses serious complications and burden on EWS families without commensurate benefits”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/retain-rs-8-lakh-ews-cap-for-admissions-recommends-panel/articleshow/88654017.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||India||Covid vaccination for teens starts today, 6.8 lakh register||NEW DELHI: Over 6.79 lakh children between 15-18 were registered on the Co-Win platform till 9 pm Sunday to receive Covid vaccination that will begin for this cohort from Monday. These children will be due to be administered Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin in two doses with a gap of 28 days. The Centre has advised states and Union Territories to provide separate vaccination centres, session sites, queue and different vaccination teams for the 15-18 year age group to avoid any inadvertent mixing of vaccines. While online registration for children vaccination opened from January 1, over 3.23 lakh youngsters between 15-18 enrolled on the first day itself. Children can also walk in and do onsite registration at the designated vaccination centres from Monday onwards. When government opened Covid vaccination for all adults above 18, nearly 2.28 crore registrations were recorded in the first two days (April 28 and 29). While the numbers of children between 15-18 years registered so far are low in comparison to adults, the size of cohorts also vary for the two categories. There are an estimated 7.40 crore children in the 15-18 age group eligible for the vaccination, according to health ministry’s estimates. On the other hand, there were around 94 crore adults above 18 at the time the shots were provided for them with around 55 crore population between 18 and 45 years age. Besides, in case of youngsters, the decision makers are mostly parents – many of whom are still apprehensive about vaccinating children, an official said. “Parents are usually over cautious, we have found. Initially, we do not expect the numbers to be very high. It will pick up gradually with subsiding hesitancy. Similar trends have been noticed in other countries too,” the official said. The government’s decision to start Covid immunisation in children between 15-18 years is based on scientific assessment of local as well as global data that shows 75% of the Covid-19 deaths in children during last two years have been in the same age group, he said. Also while the disease is not widespread in this age group, the more transmissible Omicron raises fears that kids could be affected and bring the infection home to more vulnerable elders. Overall, India has administered over 145.7 crore doses of Covid vaccines so far. This includes over 90% of adults getting at least one dose of the jabs, whereas 65% of adults above 18 years age fully vaccinated with two doses. The government plans to expand vaccination to all age groups in phases. However, since youngsters behave more like adults and their movement and interaction with others are also more, they have been prioritised among children for vaccination. Vaccination of 15-18 year old is also expected to aid education normalisation in schools. The Centre has also advised states to ensure the orientation of vaccinators and vaccination team members and the identification of dedicated session sites for this category of beneficiaries.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/vaccination-for-teens-starts-today-6-8-lakh-register/articleshow/88654151.cms||Sushmi Dey

An additional seven potential candidates under development are also being tested against the variant. Some of the variant-specific vaccines could be rolled out over the next few months, reports Rupali Mukherjee. In India, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has already started research to study the efficacy of Covishield and Covaxin against the new coronavirus variant. The vaccines under development globally include Betuvax-CoV-2, Inovio (INO-4800), Valneva (VLA2001), Oravax, Gritstone (GRT-R910), Daiichi Sankyo (DS-5670) and KM Biologics (KD-414). Some of these could be used as boosters or independent vaccines, latest data compiled by Unicef says. Further, existing vaccines that have already been approved for use globally — including those by Pfizer/ BioNTech, Moderna, Bharat Biotech, Serum Institute of India, Janssen, Sinopharm, Sinovac, Gamaleya, Novavax, AstraZeneca and Anhui ZL — are also being tested to check their efficacy against Omicron. The timelines of rollout for certain variant-specific vaccines among these is as early as this month. Initial results have demonstrated a reduction in the production of neutralising antibodies against Omicron (compared to previously detected strains) for all vaccines tested so far, for most of the companies. However, most of these are lab tests and real-world data is still awaited. Omicron was declared a variant of concern by the World Health Organisation on November 26 in view of an unprecedented number of mutations and preliminary evidence suggesting an increased risk of infectivity and capacity for immune escape. Regarding the pipeline, Unicef says three vaccine candidates are under regulatory review and 12 candidates are at Phase III clinical trials. So far, 30 vaccines have been approved for use for Covid-19 by at least one national regulatory authority. In light of Omicron, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) has accelerated research and development of broadly protective vaccines by investing in Affinivax Inc for a novel vaccine candidate designed to protect against new Covid-19 variants, as well as by expanding an agreement with Gritstone bio, to support the development of a self-amplifying mRNA (SAM) vaccine designed to tackle Omicron and future Covid-19 variants. Tests have also been conducted to study the effect of six booster vaccines on the levels of neutralising antibodies as a potential second line of defence against severe disease. These tests are vital as they provide more information on whether variant-specific vaccines will be necessary or whether booster shots may be sufficient.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/companies-rush-to-roll-out-jabs-specific-to-omicron-strain/articleshow/88654201.cms||Rupali Mukherjee

This followed the Mumbai cyber police registering a case and initiating a probe into complaints that doctored photographs of at least 100 prominent women from the minority community were put up for auction on the app. The ‘Bulli Bai’ controversy has triggered outrage, especially on social media. In her complaint to Delhi police, the journalist said: “I was shocked to find out this morning that a website/portal called bullibai.github.io (since deleted) had a doctored picture of me in an improper, unacceptable and clearly lewd context. This needs immediate action, as the same is clearly designed to harass me…” The uploading of pictures on the ‘Bulli Bai’ app was similar to the ‘Sulli Deals’ upload last July. Once opened, the face of a minority community woman would be randomly displayed as ‘Bulli Bai’. No concrete action has been taken against the perpetrators in the ‘Sulli Deals’ case yet. GitHub has blocked the ‘Bulli Bai’ site. “GitHub confirmed blocking the user this morning. CERT and police authorities are coordinating further action,” tweeted Union IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw on Sunday. He said the government was working with police in Delhi and Mumbai. The special cell of Delhi police has also started a technical probe to track down the culprits. Shiv Sena MP Priyanka Chaturvedi flagged the ‘Bulli Bai’ app on Saturday to Mumbai police and Maharashtra minister of state for home and IT Satej Patil. Taking cognisance of misogyny and communal hatred, Patil ordered immediate and strict action against the culprits. Within hours, Mumbai police initiated an inquiry. “Digital platforms like these are rife with misogyny and communal hatred aimed at women. This is very disturbing and shameful…” Patil tweeted. The National Commission for Women has also written to Delhi police to expedite action in the case “so that such crimes are not repeated”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/firs-filed-in-bulli-bai-auction-site-blocked/articleshow/88654261.cms||Raj Shekhar
---||Business||Work from anywhere: Tier-2 cities to earn big||MUMBAI: In a job seeker’s market, the trend of work moving to talent — and not the other way round — would accelerate in 2022. The norm of work-from-anywhere would get further reinforced and a clear indication of this is that cities like Ahmedabad, Chandigarh, Thiruvananthapuram, Bhubaneswar, Nagpur, Indore, Jaipur and Vadodara, to name a few, are getting captured in the top 10 of Randstad’s salary trend report. Shared exclusively with TOI, the report shows Ahmedabad has emerged strongly as one of the fastest-growing cities in the country. Among tier-2 cities, Chandigarh tops the chart in salaries paid at the junior (average CTC Rs 5.7 lakh per annum) and mid levels (Rs 13.7 lakh) — ahead of the national averages of Rs 4.4 lakh and Rs 11 lakh, respectively. Thiruvananthapuram comes a close second, with a variance of 3.5% and 1.9%, respectively. At the senior level, Chandigarh (Rs 26.5 lakh) stands third, behind Bhubaneswar (Rs 31.2 lakh) and Kochi (Rs 28.8 lakh). Overall, Bengaluru continues to be the top tier-1 city in salary pay-scales in junior (Rs 6.7 lakh) and mid-level jobs (Rs 18.1 lakh), while in senior levels Mumbai (Rs 35.7 lakh) has retained its ranking as the top payer. NCR (Rs 32.7 lakh) ranks third in salaries at the senior job level, but moves between the fifth and sixth positions at the junior and mid levels while Chennai (Rs 5.6 lakh) ranks third at the junior levels with a variance of around 16% from that of Bengaluru. Randstad India MD & CEO Viswanath P S said that while the report reveals a significant jump across the board in average salaries of junior, mid- and senior-level professionals, the firm has also captured the emergence of tier-2 cities last year. “We firmly believe that they (tier-2) are the future talent hubs and job-creation centres. Our conviction has been borne out by the fact that tier-2 cities have made great strides in salary levels due to a lot of investments in building excellent physical and social infrastructure. This is also a great indication of an exciting trend that is emerging — organisations have discovered the advantages of having a borderless, multi-faceted workforce that can deliver ‘anytime, anywhere’ work. So, we could say that work is seeking out talent in this new model, right up to tier-2 cities,” said Viswanath. Expanding from a traditional textile hub to cover chemicals, pharmaceuticals and healthcare, and now IT, Ahmedabad is only marginally behind the national average salary at mid-to-senior levels. At senior levels, Ahmedabad (Rs 31.9 lakh) pays better than Hyderabad (Rs 29.8 lakh), Chennai (Rs 28.6 lakh) and Kolkata (Rs 28.6 lakh). Mid-level and senior account executives in BFSI are paid the most in Ahmedabad (Rs 8 lakh and 15.3 lakh, respectively) after Kolkata (Rs 12.7 lakh & Rs 27.3 lakh), Mumbai (Rs 9.3 lakh & Rs 19.3 lakh) and NCR (Rs 8.7 lakh & Rs 17 lakh). At the senior level, Bhubaneswar leads the table with an average CTC (Rs 31.2 lakh) that is on par with the median level of tier-1 cities. A key factor fuelling this trend is mining and steel manufacturing companies operating in the city as also the IT/ITeS sector that is gaining prominence with companies setting up offices. While Kochi (Rs 5 lakh) ranks third in salaries in the junior level, fourth in the mid level (Rs 12.1 lakh), and second in the senior level (Rs 28.8 lakh), Vadodara too shows an interesting trend in progressively increasing salaries as the job level increases. Randstad said with the increasing push being given for its real estate, healthcare and educational infrastructure, Vadodara should move up further in future. In Jaipur, Nagpur, Lucknow, Indore and Coimbatore, the variances are higher in the junior and senior levels. This could be due to the predominance of non-IT industries in these cities, such as manufacturing, engineering and textiles, says the report. Across the board, there has been a significant jump in average salaries of the three job role hierarchies. On a national scale, the mid-level salaries are more than three times that of the junior levels (Rs 17.3 lakh and Rs 5.5 lakh, respectively), while the senior level salaries are close to twice that of the mid levels (Rs 32.5 lakh and Rs 17.3 lakh, respectively). This trend spans all locations, which shows that a high premium is placed on seniority of job levels. In salaries paid, professional services rank first in the mid-level (Rs 20.5 lakh) and second in both the junior and senior levels (Rs 6.2 and Rs 37.8 lakh). There is also a high demand for and premium placed on ITeS, professional services (emerged as a vital industry post-Covid) and advertising, marketing and PR industries. Average CTCs for senior professionals in these ‘top 3’ industries (Rs 39.4, Rs 37.8 and Rs 35.8 lakh) exceed the top average CTC for the same job level in tier-1 cities (Rs 35.7 lakh). Among IT professionals with an experience of 6-10 years, Hadoop specialists (Rs 24.8 lakh), testing practitioners, other than manual and automation testing (Rs 22.9 lakh), and specialty doctors (Rs 22.5 lakh) feature as the ‘top 3’ hot-skilled professionals. “While IT niche skills still occupy prime positions, specialty doctors occupy the third position among the ‘hot jobs’. Healthcare is poised to occupy a top-paying industry slot in the coming years, along with professional services, IT, and internet & e-commerce — and niche skilled professionals in these industries can look forward to a fulfilling future,” said Viswanath. Function-wise, senior accounting professionals earn most in Bengaluru followed by NCR and Ahmedabad. In HR, payroll skills at senior levels are valued most in Mumbai, Kolkata and Ahmedabad, while in legal, regulatory affairs professionals are most paid in Ahmedabad in mid and senior (after Mumbai) levels. A senior data analyst in BFSI is paid the most in Kolkata (Rs 20.4 lakh) while a senior investment banker in BFSI gets paid highest in Bengaluru (Rs 42.3 lakh). Kolkata is also the highest payer for architects (Rs 49.9 lakh) and civil engineers (Rs 39.5 lakh) at senior positions in the construction and infrastructure industry. Hyderabad is the highest payer for fashion/graphic/accessory designers at junior (Rs 5.9 lakh) and mid-levels (Rs 19.3 lakh) in FMCG & retail. Graphic designers in manufacturing are paid the highest in Kolkata across levels.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/work-from-anywhere-tier-2-cities-to-earn-big/articleshow/88654293.cms||Namrata Singh

Besides, states were also advised to prepare a weekly plan to expand vaccination coverage, particularly in the five poll-bound states of Punjab, Goa, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and Manipur. In a high-level meeting with states on Sunday, Mandaviya asked states to leave no stone unturned in ramping up infrastructure to manage a surge, the health ministry said in a statement. Underlining the new Omicron variant is highly transmissible and many countries are witnessing a surge three to four times higher than their earlier peaks, Mandaviya warned states that a major surge in cases can overwhelm the medical system, asking them to be prepared and re-energise teams at the ground level for effective containment measures. The Centre has also decided to hold a series of webinars from January 5 to 19 on various aspects of clinical management of Covid cases in collaboration with AIIMS, Delhi. In a letter to states and UTs, health secretary Rajesh Bhushan asked all state-level Centres of Excellence (CoEs) and doctors in public and private district-level Covid-19 health facilities to attend these webinars.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ramp-up-vaccine-coverage-centre-to-poll-bound-states/articleshow/88654327.cms||---

Modi said youths will now get the right kind of opportunities in games. He said till five years ago, daughters in UP were afraid to move out of their houses after sunset but now they are “rising like stars” . Referring to the Kairana exodus in which over 250 Hindu families are claimed to have fled due to fear of criminals, Modi said, “People of Meerut and adjoining areas can never forget how houses were set ablaze and people were forced to leave. All this while, earlier governments were indulging in their own games.” Referring to the closure of illegal Sotiganj car scrap market in his speech -- the second time he has done so in his rallies in west UP – he said Yogi govt has “ended the game of theft of cars”. Mocking former CM Mulayam Singh Yadav without naming him, Modi said, “Governments should behave like guardians and motivate and support people with talents. It should not say ‘ladko se galtiyan ho jati hain (boys make mistakes sometime)’.” Mulayam had in 2014 said it’s wrong to give death sentence for rapes as boys make mistakes. Modi also spoke about Meerut’s sports goods, jewellery and gajak-rewari industries. “Meerut is also known as a manufacturing hub of sports goods, which are exported to over 100 countries. This is the true meaning of ‘local for vocal’ and ‘local for global’,” said the PM. The sports university will come up in Salawa village on the outskirts of Meerut city.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-dig-at-opposition-yogi-government-plays-jail-jail-with-crooks/articleshow/88654420.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||India||‘Foreign test kits can’t spot Omicron’s elusive sibling’||PUNE: The elusive sibling (sub-lineage) of the Omicron variant, BA.2, cannot be picked up by the imported RT-PCR kit having an S-gene drop, researchers involved in tracking the virus in India said on Sunday. The variant has three sub-lineages BA.1, BA.2, and BA.3 along with the original B.1.1.529 strain. A senior ICMR virologist told TOI that while they share a number of common defining mutations and appear to be co-circulating, the BA.2 sub-lineage does not carry the Spike del 69-70 mutation. As such, it may hinder the use of commercially available imported RT-PCR kits to diagnose probable Omicron cases from positive clinical samples based on S-gene drop or S-gene target failure. “This means that we have to rely mainly on the whole genome sequencing for Omicron detection,” the expert added. The finding is likely to shake the existing dual RT-PCR testing strategy which the states with confirmed Omicron cases have adopted for faster detection. Under the dual testing, suspected patients’ throat/nasal swab samples are being tested using a standard RT-PCR kit and if detected positive, the same sample undergoes a second test with an imported RT-PCR kit having an S-gene drop. Only those samples showing positive for S-gene drop or S-gene target failure (SGTF) are genome-sequenced, on priority, for faster Omicron confirmation. Besides cost-cutting, the dual testing strategy was expected to help in picking up the highly probable Omicron cases and save resources. The mutations in the S gene of the Omicron variant are being used for differentiating between the Omicron variant and the other SARS-CoV2 variants. “But, in the sub-lineage BA.2, the deletion of 69-70 amino acid position is not present. Therefore, despite being an Omicron variant, the sub-lineage BA.2 can be falsely interpreted as a SARS-CoV2 variant other than Omicron. Therefore, the RT-PCR-SGTF kit should not be relied upon too much for screening of samples for Omicron variant,” the virologist involved in whole genome sequencing said. The cost of genome sequencing goes up to Rs 5,000 per Covid positive sample in India, including the transport, human resource, and other overheads. The cost per kit of a standard RT-PCR kit and imported RT-PCR kit with SGTF is Rs 19 and Rs 240, respectively. Hence, the total cost of the dual RT-PCR costs does not exceed Rs 260.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/foreign-test-kits-cant-spot-omicrons-elusive-sibling/articleshow/88654437.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Sarma asked the employees intending to avail the leave to get ready to furnish a dozen photographs to prove that they stayed with their parents, or in-laws, during the four days. While the state government has allowed leave on Thursday and Friday, the special leave will stretch to weekend holidays on Saturday and Sunday, making it a four-day vacation. Sources said though the government decided to allow the four-day leave for a noble cause, officials were planning to go for outings to tourist destinations, leaving their parents or in-laws alone at home.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/get-pic-proof-of-holiday-with-parents-himanta-biswa-sarma/articleshow/88654667.cms||Kangkan Kalita

Some of them have deferred reopening of physical classes after Christmas vacation. Many schools said parents have started raising concerns over sending their children to campuses when classes resume after Christmas vacation. "We will continue both online and offline classes so as to not force parents to send children to campuses. We've received letters from many parents expressing their concerns as cases have started rising again," said Mansoor Ali Khan, member, board of management, Delhi Public Schools. Schools to observe situation, take a callGEAR Innovative International that had planned to restart offline classes by January 19 said it "will calibrate their action by January 10". "We believe the attendance for offline classes will be affected because of the rising cases. Some trend might emerge by January 10," said M Srinivasan, founder. "We had plans of reopening after January 9. We will now watch the situation and make a decision next week," said Shanthi Menon, principal, Deens Academy. Some schools that were expected to reopen on Monday have deferred starting the offline classes. A school in east Bengaluru has informed its parents that students will continue online class till January 7 and a decision on offline classes will be taken post this based on the situation. A school in north Bengaluru postponed the physical reopening of campuses citing vaccination drive on campus for children of 15- to 18-year-olds by BBMP. It plans to resume offline schooling by January 10. Many campuses have tied up with private hospitals and BBMP for vaccination on campus. Several schools in the city have sought RT-PCR test reports of students returning from other states for physical classes. They have said teachers will also be tested before they resume classes. "We are unsure how the increase in cases will affect the attendance. While we hope our section of parents would continue to send their children for offline school, we request the government that schools should be the last to close if any situation arose. There has been no significant increase in cases from school campuses. Schools cannot take the brunt for others' fault," said D Shashi Kumar, secretary, Association of Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools of Karnataka. Educationists are worried that another round of closure would turn disastrous for children, who have already lost one and a half years of offline classes to the pandemic.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/some-schools-postpone-reopening-stick-to-e-class/articleshow/88654686.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas

The ship, Cordelia Cruises’ Empress, had come from Mumbai. “After testing passengers for Covid-19, some tested positive,” said health minister Vishwajit Rane. “We have not allowed them to dock the ship. They have a tie-up with a private hospital for testing, and we’ve told them to test all passengers before they leave the ship.” However, MPT and health officials said only one crew member (and no passengers) tested positive via an antigen test while the ship was still on its way to Goa, with 2,017 passengers aboard. The antigen result has to be confirmed via an RT-PCR test. Till 11.30pm, about 500 samples were collected and results of first batch were expected by 1am. “Testing will continue throughout the night,” Pathologist Dr Eugene D’Souza, a consultant at Victor Hospital which is doing the tests, told TOI. “We have allowed the ship to berth, but everyone will be tested before they disembark. All the passengers are double-vaccinated. The ship doctor had tested a crew member who had fever for a day. The vessel was kept outside the port limits while the authorities were informed,” an MPT official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/staffer-tests-positive-jitters-for-2000-cruise-travellers/articleshow/88654700.cms||---

After a meeting with CM Basavaraj Bommai earlier in the day, revenue minister R Ashoka said the state government will accept and implement recommendations of the Covid-19 technical advisory committee (TAC) in full. The night curfew that is in force is set to end on Jan 7. The high-powered committee on Covid-19 will meet on January 4 or 5 to discuss the need for more restrictions in the state. We are ensuring enough ICU beds and oxygen supply, says Bommai"We'll soon impose more stringent restrictions across the state and urge people to cooperate with the government. Otherwise, we may have to force a lockdown on the state," said Ashoka. He cited the example of Maharashtra, where the situation is "worsening", and said the neighbouring state may announce a lockdown soon. "We want to avoid a similar situation by assessing the state's requirement in the coming days," he said. Bommai, in Belagavi, said the government was waging a two-pronged fight – augmenting the health system and imposing tough restrictions – against the virus. "We're ensuring there are enough beds, ICU beds and adequate oxygen supply to save lives. I've directed the health department to increase the number of ICU beds and accelerate the vaccination drive. I've asked pharmaceutical companies to keep the production and supply intact," said the CM. Bommai said those coming into the state through Belagavi and Vijayapura districts will have to carry negative RT-PCR report and vaccination certificate and asked district administration to strengthen surveillance at the border checkposts. "These checks will no doubt cause inconvenience for a few passengers, but we have to take this step to protect the people of Karnataka," said the CM.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/3rd-wave-inescapable-more-curbs-soon-ktaka/articleshow/88655586.cms||---

Bommai, in Belagavi, said the government was waging a two-pronged fight – augmenting the health system and imposing tough restrictions – against the virus. "We're ensuring there are enough beds, ICU beds and adequate oxygen supply to save lives. I've directed the health department to increase the number of ICU beds and accelerate the vaccination drive. I've asked pharmaceutical companies to keep the production and supply intact," said the CM. Bommai said those coming into the state through Belagavi and Vijayapura districts will have to carry negative RT-PCR report and vaccination certificate and asked district administration to strengthen surveillance at the border checkposts. "These checks will no doubt cause inconvenience for a few passengers, but we have to take this step to protect the people of Karnataka," said the CM.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/3rd-wave-inescapable-more-curbs-soon-ktaka/articleshow/88654692.cms||---

Nearly 98% of the total toll collected through FASTag accounts for only NH stretches. According to data captured by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), the toll collection increased by Rs 502 crore in December compared to November last year. The year-on-year comparison shows toll collection increased by Rs 1,375 crore in last month against Rs 2,304 crore in December 2020. One of the reasons behind the quantum jump in last month’s toll was resumption of user fee collection at some toll plazas in Punjab and Haryana after farmers suspended their protests. Second, it’s also an indication of more economic activities and third, the road transport ministry has expedited the toll notifications for commencing collections on completed stretches. “However, the increase in collection is a sign of how all leakages have been plugged by implementing FASTag, which is a completely online process,” said an official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/toll-collection-via-fastags-at-record-rs-119-crore/day-in-december/articleshow/88654714.cms||Dipak K Dash

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: BJP, police in tug of war over Bandi Sanjay’s GO 317 stir||HYDERABAD: On a day of high political drama in Karimnagar, police beat up BJP workers and cut through iron grills before taking BJP state president Bandi Sanjay into preventive custody to foil a protest against GO 317 that specifies guidelines on employee transfers. The BJP has been protesting the controversial order demanding that the government revoke the order linked to a zonal system in providing jobs. Sanjay, the Karimnagar MP, organised a Jagaran Deeksha in his camp office in the district on Sunday, where party cadres and leaders from across the state trooped in for the overnight protest. Realising what was happening, the district police sent a notice to BJP local leaders informing them not to organise any political event citing government orders in the backdrop of Omicron's spread in the state. However, hundreds of BJP activists reached Sanjay's camp office in large numbers, ignoring the police order. The police too increased their deployment and around 7.30 pm, amid stiff resistance, the district police started to take BJP activists into preventive custody. Several women cadres also tried to resist, but at the end of the day, more than 150 were initially taken into preventive custody by the police by force. High-pitched slogans were raised against Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao and police when the arrests were being made. Both parties claimed that they were assaulted. The entire drama took an ugly turn when Sanjay and nearly 50 others locked themselves by putting a lock to a grill door of the camp office to prevent police from entering his room. Around 9 pm, police used gas cutters besides construction tools to cut through the metal doors. All Covid-19 guidelines were flouted by both police and BJP activists as they confronted each other. "To implement the state and central government guidelines to avoid the spread of coronavirus, we had to take BJP activists into preventive custody. There was no use of masks or social distance among the protestors,"' Karimnagar commissioner of police V Satyanarayana told TOI after the 150 activists were taken into custody. Police brought in several vehicles to shift the protesting activists. After police broke open the door, a tense situation prevailed with police finding it difficult to take Sanjay, who was surrounded by his cadres, before he was shifted into a police vehicle and taken away to a local police station. The commissioner later said that since the protesters did not heed warnings, despite police appeals using a mike, they had to use force to avoid spread of Covid. "For obstructing police from performing their duties, cases will be registered against the protesters besides on the charge of violation of Disaster Management Act," Satyanarayana said. Huzurabad MLA Eatala Rajender condemned the arrest of Sanjay Kumar, saying it was undemocratic of the police not to let the MP protest peacefully. "TRS will pay a big price for this, it will face the wrath of employees," he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/bjp-cops-in-tug-of-war-over-bandis-go-317-stir/articleshow/88654741.cms||---

His friend, who had managed to escape the attack, was found dead along the railway tracks on Sunday morning. Police suspect he died by suicide. Rahul (24), whose father is the reader of a judge in a Faridabad court, had left home in Sagarpur village around 5pm on Saturday after a phone call from a youth, identified as Hariom. “He left home saying he was going to meet Hariom near the tubewell,” a police officer said, quoting Dharmraj, Rahul’s father. Rahul took along his friend Rinku. When they reached near the tubewell, the police said, a group of 10-12 youths on bikes stopped them. They had an argument, following which Rahul was allegedly attacked with rods and then stabbed with a knife. When the group turned towards Rinku, he fled, the police said. Rinku rushed to Rahul’s home and informed his family members. By the time someone from his family reached the spot, the group had fled, leaving Rahul bleeding profusely from the stab wounds. He was taken to a private hospital in Sector 8, where he died during treatment. His autopsy report said he had lost a lot of blood. Rinku’s family members said he was too disbursed that night to speak. “He told his family he would die too. But they thought he was saying all these because he was saddened by his friend’s sudden death,” said a police officer. On Sunday morning, Rinku left home without telling anyone in his family where he was going. A few hours later, he was found dead by the tracks near Ashwati station. The nature of the injuries suggested he may have been hit by a passing train. The police suspect he might have jumped before a moving train. A case of murder has been registered against unknown persons at Sadar police station. The police said Rahul had been stabbed in a revenge attack. “A case has been registered and the police are trying to trace the accused,” said Sube Singh, a spokesperson for Faridabad police.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/faridabad/student-killed-friend-found-dead-by-rly-tracks-next-day/articleshow/88654749.cms||---

Sunday’s order to the police was the third by the court since December 30.The court of judicial magistrate (first class) Anil Kumar said it would initiate contempt proceedings against the police if the FIR was not filed within the stipulated time. The Gurgaon police commissioner was directed to ensure it was done.It was on Thursday that the court had first directed the police to register an FIR against MGF Developers. After two days, it passed another order and asked the station house officer of City police station to appear before it on Sunday. The police officer informed the court on Sunday that there was a delay in registering the FIR because the complainant, M3M, had not mentioned the “place of occurrence”. He then sought three days’ time to file the FIR.The counsel for MGF also sought three days to study the previous order of the court. However, the lawyer representing M3M submitted a copy of an email it had sent the police commissioner with the previous court order asking for an FIR to be registered attached. The judge observed that the email showed that the city police chief had complete knowledge of the court order, but the FIR was not filed even after that.After hearing all the parties, the court gave the police time till Monday 1pm to file the FIR or face action. “In case of non-compliance, contempt proceedings will be initiated by the court without any delay. The SHO concerned is directed to submit the copy of FIR on or before 1pm on January 3,” the court observed.The petition the court is hearing is related to a land deal that took place between the two developers in 2016. According to the complaint filed by M3M, Emaar-MGF had approached them with an offer of selling 31 acres in Choma village of Gurgaon. M3M claimed to have paid Rs 88 crore for the land parcel in November 2016, but came to know in December this year that the same plot had been sold to another company. “MGF has done a fraud with us. We have full faith in the judiciary system of our country and the police. We are sure that action will be taken and justice will be delivered,” news agency PTI quoted Ekta Yadav, the legal head of M3M, as saying.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/mgf-vs-m3m-court-wants-cops-to-file-fir-by-1pm-today/articleshow/88654751.cms||Bagish Jha

This is the highest single-day spike in infections after May 22, when 516 people had tested positive. Gurugram now has 1,439 active cases, of whom only eight are in hospitals. The rising cases have been a cause for concern for the officials. In December alone, the city added 1,264 cases — an average of 40 a day. This is a sharp rise from just 9 average daily cases in the previous month. Testing, too, has been intensified. On Sunday, 6,038 tests were carried out in total. The positivity rate now stands at 0.6%. In the wake of rising cases, the Haryana government has strengthened Covid restrictions. Cinemas will now be closed and malls and markets will be off limits in the evenings in the city and four other districts where Covid cases are fast rising. While malls and markets would be allowed to operate till 5pm, all theatres and multiplexes, entertainment parks and exhibition venues would be closed, Bars and restaurants can stay open for now but only at 50% capacity. The government will take a call on the additional restrictions again on January 12. Officials urged people to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. “People should get vaccinated at the earliest. As we have been witnessing a surge now, residents should not step out unnecessarily. We have urged police to ensure all Covid protocols are followed in the public,” chief medical officer Virender Yadav said. The rise in cases has also prompted the administration to declare 16 new containment zones. Health department teams will carry out door-to-door screenings and the municipal corporation will resume regular sanitisation. A containment zone will be de-notified after two weeks if there is no further surge in cases. At present, Gurugram has 21 containment zones.

He also told them to reactivate the Covid control room and the district-level task force to monitor the situation. The directions came during a review meeting, taking stock of the Covid-19 preparedness in Haryana.On Sunday, Khattar claimed that the government could tackle a possible third wave. “We are in a better position to control the situation now, with 84 PSA (pressure swing adsorption) oxygen plants installed in various government hospitals and medical colleges and 54 in private hospitals. Medicines and injections are also available in sufficient quantity. From Monday, vaccination of the eligible children between the ages of 15 and 18 would begin. Booster doses will be given to senior citizens above 60 years from January 10,” Khattar said on video conference.Talking about the beds status, Yash Garg, deputy commissioner of Gurgaon, said, “We have reserved 25% of the hospital beds in the city for Covid patients. However, if required, we will increase the number. All the major hospitals have been asked to create special isolation wards, with a minimum of 10 beds, keeping in mind the emergence of the Omicron variant," Garg said. Moreover, two makeshift Covid facilities in sectors 67 and 14 are currently functional. Minor repair work is ongoing at the Tau Devi Lal facility, Garg added, but it will start operations within two or three days. "Currently, only a few beds have patients as most of the cases are mild and asymptomatic," he said.On Saturday, the government had imposed additional Covid restrictions in five districts, including Gurgaon. While allowing malls and markets to operate till 5 pm, the government had closed down schools, colleges, cinema halls, sports complexes, stadiums, swimming pools, entertainment parks and exhibition venues till January 12. “The government issued an order on Saturday, imposing more restrictions, limiting operational time of malls and markets till 5 pm, allowing bars and restaurants to open with a capping of 50% capacity till the night curfew at 11 pm to check the spread of infection. While cases are increasing, there is no need to panic.

It is the second extension in less than a fortnight. With private schools resisting the admissions, the deadline had earlier got extended from December 25 to 31.The extension conveyed to the entire education department via a letter will accommodate students seeking admissions under Rule 134A of the Haryana Education Rules. The directorate of school education has also sought a special committee to iron out the issues, expedite the admissions and upload relevant information online. Education officials are under directions to upload the information of schools denying EWS admissions and reasons they cite.“Despite repeated reminders and consultations with the private schools, it has been observed that there’s a general sense of delaying the admissions. We have now formed a special committee to iron out the issues between the schools and the parents to facilitate the admissions. We have given schools a week to comply with the orders. During this time, officials will regularly update the number of admissions and information about the schools stonewalling the process. This will help us track the progress in real-time and if required, take action,” said a senior education department official.However, some private schools said all pending dues should get cleared before the admissions, with others waiting for court orders. Schools have approached the Punjab and Haryana High Court against the EWS admissions.Till last week, city private schools had admitted less than 20% of 900 eligible students. “It is almost the end of the session, and uncertainty over school reopening has already disrupted the pedagogy. Besides, parents have been furnishing false income certificates. We don’t understand the need for such hurried implementation when the matter is in court,” said Drona Public School principal Bhisham Bharadwaj.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/deadline-of-ews-admissions-in-pvt-schools-extended-till-jan-7/articleshow/88654756.cms||---
---||Noida||Why the toll-free DND drive is taking a toll||Noida: A lifeline for intercity travel since its inauguration in January 2001, the 9.2km Delhi-Noida-Direct (DND) Flyway no longer looks like the showpiece infrastructure project it was built to be. A pale shadow of its former self, it has met the fate of many an Indian road: patches of rough surfaces and potholes, damaged signboards, defunct streetlights in places, absent road markings at others and garbage collecting along the shoulders. Noida resident Rakesh Jha, who takes the DND to Delhi regularly, wonders why potholes aren’t filled immediately on a road as important. He said the ride has become bumpier at the Delhi entry of Flyway near the toll plaza and intermittently elsewhere. Jha has also been regularly tweeting about the non-functional toilets and streetlights along the DND.The state of the DND surprised Avnish Kumar, who lives in Sector 71 (Noida), when he started going to office again after a pandemic-induced work-from-home break. “I have been staying in Noida for 25 years and commuting to and from Delhi, but I’ve never seen the DND Flyway in such a state. Take streetlights, for example. Some are working on the portion between Noida and the old toll shed but as you move further towards Delhi, I find most are unlit. Can’t understand why they not working?” he asked.Surbhi Chandel, a college student residing in Noida, said a well-lit road would be more reassuring for a two-wheeler rider like her, as would be the presence of an ambulance and a police patrol vehicle, especially at night when traffic moves faster. “Driving on the DND isn’t what it used to be, especially for those like me who take the Flyway during late hours,” said Chandel.Brajesh Sharma, a resident of Antriksh Golf View 2 in Sector 78, who had submitted a complaint with the Noida Authority about DND’s dysfunctional streetlights, said: “About nine months back, some of the lights were fixed. But many of these are again not functional.” Sharma pointed to billboards and banners that are conspicuous along the entire stretch of the DND. “So, how can one say there is no revenue flowing in? Isn’t the money that is coming going into the maintenance of the road?” he said.The Noida Toll Bridge Company Limited (NTBCL), which is the custodian of the DND, earns advertising revenue from the ads on the billboards and the gantries along the DND, which is under the jurisdiction of the Noida Authority, the South Delhi Municipal Corporation and the East Delhi Municipal Corporation. The Noida Authority has now stopped giving its space to NTBCL due to a disagreement over payment of licence fees and recovery notices. NTBCL did not share details of the revenues it earned from advertisements from the two Delhi corporations.But problems for the DND began once toll collection from commuters was stopped following directives of the Supreme Court and the Allahabad high court in October 2016. The DND toll was scrapped by the high court, which heard a petition from FONRWA, a grouping of Noida-based residents’ welfare associations, against the “excessive” user fee that was being charged from commuters (Rs 25, one way for a car) and ruled in its favour.The financial troubles of its parent company have also affected NTBCL, which is a special purpose vehicle floated by infrastructure giant IL&FS. The DND was conceived to be run under the build-own-operate-transfer (BOOT) model in the concession agreement signed between the Noida Authority, IL&FS and NTBCL in 1997. IL&FS was responsible for all investments in the project and the agreement gave NTBCL control of the DND for 30 years from the contract date, or till IL&FS could recover its entire investment. NTBCL argued it had not been able to recover its cost, but the court, which perused audit reports of its income, rejected that contention.Not having to pay toll was a relief for commuters but no roadmap was discussed for maintenance of the DND. NP Singh, former president of FONRWA, said that when the court directed that toll collection by the NTBCL will be done away with at the DND, it made no comment on the maintenance of the bridge. “Therefore, it is the responsibility of the Noida Authority and the Delhi government to carry out maintenance work on the DND Flyway through NTBCL. We will write to both the state governments on the issue,” Singh said. Besides, most key roads need major repairs and a safety audit after 20 years of operations. For the DND, no such exercise has been conducted yet.Noida Authority CEO Ritu Maheshwari said problems like potholes, dysfunctional streetlights and broken railings were in the “Delhi portion” of the Flyway. “We had written to our Delhi counterpart to start work on the same. They have started the work on filling up potholes,” she told TOI.Asked about the lack of maintenance, Maheshwari said NTBCL had filed an appeal in the Supreme Court against the high court order stopping toll collection. “The case is still going on in the Supreme Court. The toll bridge company is not doing any work at present. Many notices have been sent. The pothole repair work is currently being done by the local administration,” she said.In an email response, the NTBCL, however, told TOI that the “operation and maintenance (O&M) obligations of the Noida Toll Bridge (including landscaping, security, cleaning, minor repairs, pothole repair and electrical repair) are being carried out diligently, regularly and efficiently by the company despite the collection of user fee been suspended since October 2016 and the government of UP & Noida defaulting in their obligations under the concession agreement to indemnify the concessionaire on account of change in law and (the) authority unilaterally seeking to negate advertisement revenues of DND and disrupt and interfere with revenues of NTBCL”.The company claimed that the work was “periodically reviewed by an independent engineer”, jointly appointed under the concession agreement by the lenders, Noida and NTBCL, and the monthly reports were submitted to the Authority. “The October report has already been submitted to the Authority and no complaints or concerns with respect to O&M obligations have been flagged in the report,” it said.NTBCL said it could not comment on its appeal on the HC judgment and issues relating to undertaking and financing of major maintenance since they were sub judice. “It may be pointed out that despite lack of support from Noida, UP government and Government of NCT Delhi, NTBCL has not delayed or defaulted on any licence fee to EDMC and SDMC, made timely utility and O&M payments, and continues to support the maintenance of the bridge in the timely and efficient manner,” it said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/why-the-toll-free-dnd-drive-is-taking-a-toll/articleshow/88654758.cms||Shikha Salaria

In the first two days of the New Year, the traffic police has issued fines to nearly 60 bikers and impounded five two-wheelers.“All 60 bikers have been fined speeding and hence, they were challaned. The five bikes were impounded because the riders didn’t have the documents.

The facility, being built at Rs 2.5 crore, will dispose of about 300 metric tonnes of dry waste and is expected to be ready in four to five months. It will engage about 400 sanitation workers, officials said. The Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority (GNIDA) has signed a memorandum of understanding with the United Nation Development Program (UNDP) and HDFC bank. While the UNDP will provide technical support for the plant, the private bank will provide funds for the project through its CSR drive. Once ready, the GNIDA will hire an agency to make goods, such as plastic boards, benches, chairs, lamps, decoration items and the road repair works, among others, from the dry waste that will be recycled at the centre. “Under this facility, we aim to proceed with our campaign of disposing the garbage generated in the sector within the locality. Dry waste will be brought for processing with the help of about 400 sanitation workers,” Deep Chandra, addition chief operating officer (ACEO) GNIDA, said. Candra said the process of picking up the waste from the collection centres and turning them into products of daily use will be all done from the MRF. “Products such as benches, plastic boards, lamps, chairs, decoration items to road repair works and other decorative products can be made from the waste processed at the MRF.

---||Noida||Buyers more inclined towards ready-to-move-in flats: Experts||GREATER NOIDA: Worried about delayed possession and insolvency proceedings against developers, people looking to own a house in the twin cities are increasingly investing in projects that are already occupied or where registry has been being executed. Observers tracking the demand and supply scenario in the real estate sector said the volume of transactions this year had surpassed expectations. Data analytics companies showed that buyers preferred ready units rather than buying flats that were priced lower in projects still unoccupied. Officials in the Noida and Greater Noida authorities said a higher number of transfer of memorandum letters had been issued this year for residential properties. Such letters are issued by the authorities after taking charges over the flat price before sale deeds in the secondary market are finalised. Pankaj Kapoor, the managing director of real estate data analytics company Liases Foras, said, “For the past year and a half, we have been seeing a higher demand for ready properties in Noida and Greater Noida. Delayed possession, insolvency proceedings against developers and logjam in execution of registry due to non-payment of dues have changed the preference of buyers. Earlier, people wanted to move into newly constructed units that offered better amenities. But now, they seem to be inclined towards projects that are not stuck in legal tangles.” Santosh Kumar, an officer on special duty at the Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority, said, “Buyers feel that properties that are ready and where sale deeds have been allowed are the safest bet in the current market scenario. Even though such properties are available at a premium and additional cost, buyers are going for them instead of opting for incomplete projects at the moment.” Avinash Tripathi, Kumar’s counterpart in the Noida Authority, said, “While we cannot comment on the primary market sales as we do not track transactions in under-construction apartments, the secondary market was not hit by the pandemic as we had expected. A lot of flats have been sold to new buyers. We observed a steady growth in the secondary market.” Sanjay Sharma, the director of SKA Group, differed. “We have observed up to 30% increase in sales in our projects. Families are aspiring to move into bigger and better living spaces after selling their existing units. Also, there has been a demand in the luxury segment. The registry logjam is a temporary issue. Buyers who know this are moving in occupied projects.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/buyers-more-inclined-towards-ready-to-move-in-flats-experts/articleshow/88654764.cms||Shalabh

The accused left the truck on the spot and fled, police said.According to police, Bulandshahr residents Parul Singh, her husband Manish Singh (32) and their daughter Gargi were visiting a relative at Greater Noida to celebrate the New Year. Around 2.30 pm on Saturday, they were returning to Bulandshahr on a bike — Parul and Gargi riding pillion – when the truck, carrying LPG cylinders, hit the bike from behind in Dadri.

We have seized the truck and launched a search to identify and arrest the driver involved in the accident,” the SHO said.On the basis of a complaint submitted by Manish, police have registered a case against an unknown person under Sections 304 A (death due to negligence), 279 (rash driving) and 388 (causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) of the Indian Penal Code, the SHO said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/woman-dies-husband-daughter-injured-in-crash/articleshow/88654765.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Coming soon: Covid vaccine specific to Omicron variant||MUMBAI: The highly-transmissible Omicron has triggered a flurry of activity globally, with at least 10 vaccine companies developing the new variant-specific vaccine, and an additional seven potential vaccine candidates that are under development being tested against the strain. Significantly, some of these variant-specific vaccines could be rolled out over the next few months. In India, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has already started research to study the efficacy of Covishield and Covaxin against the new coronavirus variant. The vaccines under development include Betuvax-CoV-2, Inovio (INO-4800), Valneva (VLA2001), Oravax, Gritstone (GRT-R910), Daiichi Sankyo (DS-5670) and KM Biologics (KD-414). Some of these candidates could be used as boosters or independent vaccines, the latest data compiled by Unicef says. Further, existing vaccines that have been already approved for use globally, including those by Pfizer/ BioNTech, Moderna, Bharat Biotech, Serum Institute of India, Janssen, Sinopharm, Sinovac, Gamaleya, Novavax, AstraZeneca, Anhui ZL, are also being tested to check their efficacy against Omicron. The timelines of rollout for certain variant-specific vaccines is as early as this month. Initial results have demonstrated a reduction in the production of neutralising antibodies against Omicron (compared to previously detected strains) for all vaccines tested so far, for most of the companies. It may be noted that most of these are lab-tests, hence real-world data is still awaited. Omicron was declared a variant of concern by the WHO on November 26 in view of an unprecedented large number of mutations and preliminary evidence suggesting an increased risk of infectivity and capacity for immune escape. Regarding the pipeline, the Unicef data says three vaccine candidates are under regulatory review and 12 candidates are at Phase III clinical trials. So far, 30 vaccines have been approved for use for Covid-19 by at least one nation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/coming-soon-covid-vaccine-specific-to-omicron-variant/articleshow/88654766.cms||Rupali Mukherjee

Shared exclusively with TOI, the report shows NCR (Rs 32. 7 lakh) ranks third in salaries at the senior job level, but moves between the fifth and sixth positions at the junior and mid-levels, while Chennai (Rs 5. 6 lakh) ranks third at the junior levels with a variance of around 16% from that of Bengaluru. Among tier-2 cities, Bhubaneswar tops the charts in salary pay-scales in senior-level jobs (Rs 31. 2 lakh), followed by Kochi (Rs 28. 8 lakh) and Chandigarh (Rs 26. 5 lakh). Randstad India MD & CEO Viswanath P S said, while the report reveals a significant jump across the board in average salaries of junior, mid and senior-level professionals, the firm has also captured the emergence of tier-2 cities in 2021. “We firmly believe that they (tier-2) are the future talent hubs and job-creation centres. Our conviction has been borne out by the fact that tier-2 cities have made great strides in salary levels due to a lot of investments in building excellent physical and social infrastructure. This is also a great indication of an exciting trend that is emerging — organisations have discovered the advantages of having a borderless, multi-faceted workforce that can deliver ‘anytime, anywhere’ work. So, we could say that work is seeking out talent in this new model, right up to tier-2 cities,” said Viswanath. Read AlsoIndia’s Omicron count crosses 1,700-mark after 123 fresh casesOdisha recorded 23 new infections, its biggest single-day jump so far, taking the total tally to 37. Of the 23 fresh cases, 10 have no recent history of foreign travel. Telangana recorded five cases, taking the state tally to 84.Expanding from a traditional textile hub to cover chemicals, pharmaceuticals & healthcare, and now IT, Ahmedabad is only marginally behind the national average salary at mid-to-senior levels. At senior levels, Ahmedabad (Rs 31. 9 lakh) pays better than Hyderabad (Rs 29. 8 lakh), Chennai (Rs 28. 6 lakh) and Kolkata (Rs 28. 6 lakh). Mid-level and senior account executives in BFSI are paid the most in Ahmedabad (Rs 8 lakh and 15. 3 lakh, respectively) after Kolkata (Rs 12. 7 lakh & Rs 27. 3 lakh), Mumbai (Rs 9. 3 lakh & Rs 19. 3 lakh) and NCR (Rs 8. 7 lakh & Rs17 lakh). At the senior level, Bhubaneswar leads the table with an average CTC (Rs 31. 2 lakh) that is on par with the median level of tier-1 cities. A key factor fuelling this trend is mining and steel manufacturing companies operating in the city as also the IT/ITeS sector that is gaining prominence with companies setting up offices. In Jaipur, Nagpur, Lucknow, Indore and Coimbatore, the variances are higher in the junior and senior levels. This could be due to the predominance of non-IT industries in these cities, such as manufacturing, engineering and textiles, says the report.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/remote-working-tier-2-cities-turn-big-earners/articleshow/88654767.cms||Namrata Singh

I was born Hindu, by religion I am Hindu and will stay Hindu forever,” Mehta said and added that Dabhoi is now moving towards Darbhavati (historical name of Dabhoi). When TOI tried to contact Mehta, he didn’t respond to calls and sent a message he was in a function.  This is the second time that Mehta’s communal remarks have gone viral. In December 2017 while campaigning in the assembly polls for Dabhoi seat, Mehta was heard saying in Patelvagha village that Dabhoi shouldn’t have a population like Dubai. He then went on to say that unlike other candidates, he won’t give a single rupee to madrasas and mosques.  “If some bearded and (skull) cap wearing person is sitting here then forgive me but there is a need to reduce their population. Many leaders here advised me to not make such comments but I said that if 90 per cent people are with me then why should I not talk about 10 per cent,” he was heard saying in the video. He had later claimed that he had talked about not giving his own money to madarsas and not that of the government. The district collector had sought explanation from Mehta for his remarks. Mehta is a realtor, who also owns schools and petrol pumps in and around the city. He is considered to be a strongman in Waghodia Road area.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/bjp-mlas-communal-remarks-go-viral/articleshow/88653496.cms||---
---||Business||‘PSU banks’ books are better than pre-Covid’||Mumbai: Public sector banks (PSBs) have emerged much stronger after the pandemic on account of the clean-up and consolidation that preceded it. In an interview with TOI, Rajkiran Rai, MD & CEO of Union Bank of India (and former chairman of Indian Banks’ Association), which absorbed Corporation Bank & Andhra Bank amid the PSB consolidation, speaks of the year gone by and what lies ahead... How was 2021 for banking? It started with positive signals and in March banks ended FY21 with better balance sheets. In April and May, we saw disruption because of the second wave. It was very brutal, we lost a lot of precious lives, but our people went out to work and strived hard to bring normalcy. We should also give it to the people of the country and the resilience with which the economy bounced back after June. Whether it is asset quality, stress levels or collection efficiency, banks are in a better position than pre-Covid. But what happened in the first and second quarter resulted in slippages. These were reflected in the Q1 and Q2 results. What are the lessons for the economy that can be put to use for the third wave? The complete lockdown in the first wave disrupted the economy. That was required at that time and most countries followed this principle. The lockdown in the second wave was more location-specific. So, disruptions to the economy, supply chain and production were localised. That helped to bounce back quickly. I do not think we will go for a massive lockdown now as people have learnt to take precautions. Many experts in this field say that hospitalisations are fewer under Omicron, but we do not know and we have to take precautions. I think we need to follow all the practices that were adopted during the second wave — digitising transactions, reducing personal contacts and avoiding big events. To what extent have you managed to complete the post-amalgamation restricting? We managed to complete the technology integration in 10 months because of the planning. Today, we are double the size of the erstwhile Union Bank and four times the size of the Corporation. We have a market share of more than 5%, branches in 15 states, and in 22 states our business market share is more than 5% in volume. We are now planning for Samarth 2.0, which is to take the bank to the next level in digitisation — both in terms of technology and tech-savvy human resources. We have created a separate digitisation department, engaged HR consultants and are recruiting specialists. What about the associate companies and subsidiaries of the erstwhile banks? We are in the process of divesting our stake in India First Life Insurance as we cannot hold a stake in more than one life insurance company. We are also selling our stake in ASREC (asset reconstruction company). We have already renamed CorpBank Securities as UBI Services and have developed it as a marketing engine. Today, 40% of our retail business is generated by our 1,000-strong marketing vertical. We plan to replicate this success in UBI Services. Banks that consolidated have lost market share... What is the ambition for future? Last four-five years, PSBs lost market share because they were on a consolidation path — correcting the balance sheet, recognising bad loans, provisioning & raising capital, and then there was the amalgamation. Now we need to focus first on retaining market share, for which we have to grow in line with the industry. I am hopeful that by the end of FY22, we will grow in line with the industry. Next year onwards, we need to grow faster than industry and the digitisation process is in that line. We are already at competitive prices — only technology and products make a difference. Once we have that, customers have no reason to go elsewhere. By March, we will launch our full-fledged trade finance module, which gives businesses full control from their office. Are there any efficiencies that have come in for good during the pandemic? Digital transactions have gone up. Today we have personal loans and Mudra loans, which are end-to-end digital, even renewals of MSME loans can be done in an end-to-end manner online. I think in 9 to 12 months, at least 25% of personal loans can be done through the system without coming to the bank for documentation. The technology orientation is here to stay with fintechs bringing in the revolution. Fintechs are identifying the pain points for customers and offering a product there. For me, this is an opportunity to collaborate as they have already built the technology and are quite agile. At the same time, they do not have the balance sheet support which we do.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/psu-banks-books-are-better-than-pre-covid/articleshow/88653730.cms||Mayur Shetty

The bank said that it was releasing the deposit numbers ahead of its financial results for the quarter ended December 2021, which is subject to approval by the audit committee of the board of directors. The share of retail deposits and deposits from small businesses declined 11.3% in three months from Rs 31,421 crore in September 2021 to Rs 27,871 crore in December 2021. As a result, the share of retail and small business deposits fell from 41.6% to 37.8% during the same period. Deposits in the bank’s current and savings account (CASA) declined to Rs 25,316 crore from September’s Rs 26,734 crore. The bank’s CASA deposit ratio fell by one percentage point to 34.4%. Year-on-year, total deposits were up 9.6%. CASA deposits recorded a 21.3% year-on-year increase.

---||Business||LIC’s IPO pricing may value it at less than Reliance, TCS||Mumbai: The government is likely to value Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) at a price more conservative than what some analysts had earlier estimated. In fact, some had even forecasted that it would be the most valuable company in India. While the valuation will be in several lakh crore rupees, it will be in single digits, which will place it below companies like Reliance Industries (Rs 16 lakh crore) and TCS (Rs 13.8 lakh crore). However, even at a conservative valuation, the initial public offer (IPO) would be the largest in the country. To encourage policyholders to participate in the IPO, LIC would be issuing shares at a discount to customers. The corporation is keen on policyholder participation as, in future, there will be a shift in the distribution of surplus. Currently, the corporation distributes only 5% of its surplus to shareholders as against the 10% that it is allowed to with the rest being distributed to the policyholders. Conservative pricing would provide a sense of comfort to retail investors. Actuarial firm Milliman has submitted its report on the embedded value of LIC, which will serve as the basis of the pricing. According to insurance industry sources, comparing LIC’s assets under management (AUM) with that of private players would give it a disproportionate valuation. This is because a large chunk of the corporation’s funds represents guaranteed return plans, group insurance funds and superannuation funds of employers. The margins in these businesses are extremely low. Currently, State Bank of India-owned SBI Life Insurance has a market capitalisation of Rs 1.2 lakh crore against assets under management of Rs 2.4 lakh crore. LIC has an AUM that is almost 15 times higher. This had prompted many to assign a value of over Rs 15 lakh crore, which is turning out to be too optimistic, according to actuaries. The corporation is likely to make the embedded value report a part of the draft red herring prospectus, which it will file incorporating first-half results. In the past, when the government had fixed an ambitious pricing for public sector units like General Insurance Corporation and New India Assurance, LIC had to step in and support the issue. This time around, the success of the issue will be incumbent only on market demand.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/lics-ipo-pricing-may-value-it-at-less-than-reliance-tcs/articleshow/88653742.cms||Mayur Shetty

The state has till now reported 510 confirmed cases of the fast-spreading variant. Thirty-six of the new cases were reported from Pune, eight from Pimpri-Chinchwad, two each from Pune rural and Sangli, and one each from Thane and Mumbai. Of the cumulative tally of 510, the highest, 328, has been reported from Mumbai, followed by Pune, which has seen nearly 110 cases. Civic officials said that Mumbai numbers include 76 people who landed at the international airport and were found positive.  State officials said that out of total Omicron cases, 193 have already been discharged. In Mumbai, civic officials said that out of 130 international travellers, 128 have been discharged till now. The rest, who are recovering in hospital, don’t have a severe disease.  In Navi Mumbai, which has 10 Omicron cases so far, authorities said they have found community spread of the variant. They said recently six people had tested positive for Omicron but had no travel history, which indicated community spread. According to NMMC officials, all the 10 cases of Omicron so far are asymptomatic.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/50-omicron-cases-take-total-to-510-in-the-state/articleshow/88654770.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Isolation can be reduced to 5 days for Covid+ve health staff||MUMBAI: District authorities can reduce the isolation period of Covid-positive healthcare workers from seven days to five if there is a severe shortage of manpower. Anticipating that a huge surge in hospitalisations could overwhelm hospitals, the public health department has released a new protocol with a shortened isolation period. Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary (health), wrote to all divisional commissioners, district collectors, municipal commissioners and CEOs of zilla parishads stating, “Considering that Omicron variant may infect large number of persons in short time, and the need of trained staff, district authorities can reduce isolation period for trained human resource from 7 days to 5 days as per need in consultation with public health department.” The new protocol for isolation of healthcare providers states that if the medical staffer is asymptomatic and fully vaccinated, he/she can resume work after one week of isolation. That duration can be further curtailed by two days in case of manpower shortage. If the person is asymptomatic but unvaccinated or partially vaccinated, a repeat RT-PCR test will be carried out before they are allowed back. If they test positive, RT-PCR will be repeated after three days and, if negative, they will return to work. Symptomatic healthcare workers will be admitted to hospital, depending on the severity of the disease. Currently, there is not much uniformity in the isolation norms. A state official said that since a majority of healthcare workers are fully vaccinated and have negligible symptoms, they may be called to work early. The US, too, recently shortened the isolation time for healthcare workers from 10 days to a week if they are asymptomatic and test negative, and said it could further be curtailed to five if the manpower crunch is significant. Dr Deepak Baid, former president of the Association of Medical Consultants, said that unless there is a severe shortage of staffers, the isolation period should be the same as that for any patient, which is 10 days.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/isolation-can-be-reduced-to-5-days-for-ve-health-staff/articleshow/88654771.cms||---

He also claimed that a “powerful” BJP minister has been pressuring the ministry of home affairs to extend its Mumbai zonal director Sameer Wankhede’s tenure, which ended on December 31. “ I have two audio clips of a panch in a sensitive case interacting with an NCB official, who is asking him to sign key papers with back dates. I have taken up the matter with the NCB director general. I am sure he will take action on top priority,” Malik said. He claimed that on Sunday, an NCB official, identified as Babu, summoned a panch, Maddy, for signing on backdated papers not in NCB office, but elsewhere. On Wankhede’s term extension, Malik alleged: “It appears to be a deal, else the MHA would have by now iss-ued an order for his new assignment. I am told there is an adverse report against Wankhede, still a BJP leader is lobbying for his continuation in Mumbai.” Malik, who is at loggerheads with Wankhede ever since his son-in-law Sameer Khan was arrested in an NDPS case, claimed there are doubts over NCB’s intention in challenging Kh-an’s bail before the HC. “The main accused is Karan Sajlani, along with six others, but the appeal has been filed only against my son-in-law...” Calling Malik’s allegations false and baseless, an NCB official said: “There is a convention of recording the statement of a panch before filing chargesheet. On the question of filing an appeal against Khan’s bail, the NCB has taken the decision; Wankhede has nothing to do with it.” —Prafulla Marpakwar||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/malik-attacks-ncb-alleges-lobbying-for-wankhede/articleshow/88654772.cms||---

Last month, the BMC had sought an explanation from Byculla zoo officials and its Building Maintenance (BM) department after bids for construction of the new set of animal enclosures at Byculla zoo shot a massive Rs 106 crore above the BMC’s estimates and only two companies submitted bids. In a complaint filed by BJP corporator Vinod Mishra with the EOW through lawyer Komal Kandharkar, the BJP has alleged there was cartelisation and rigging of tenders. The BMC had recently floated two tenders — one for construction of new animal enclosures for Black Jaguar, Cheetah, White Lion, Wallaby, Chimpanzee, Ring Tail Lemur, Mandrill Monkey and Lesser Flamingo; and the other for constructing exhibits for the Hippo, African Savanna, Emu, and a bird aviary. These new enclosures are to be constructed on and received from the Poddar and Mafatlal Mills adjacent to the Byculla zoo. While the tenders were estimated to cost Rs 91 crore and Rs 94 crore, the two companies bid Rs 146 crore and Rs 145 crore, respectively — an escalation of around Rs 106 crore. “We have shared details of both the companies and have asked the EOW to file a case of criminal breach of trust as despite the companies quoting 15% above the estimate, the BMC is not scrapping the tenders. We have asked EOW to take cognisance of the complaint and register an FIR,” Mishra said. BJP MLA Mihir Kotecha, too, had demanded that the tenders be scrapped. “The BMC is dragging its feet on the complaint and protecting officials who seem to be working for the private companies. I will move the HC if the tenders are not scrapped,” Kotecha said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/bjp-seeks-eow-probe-as-bmc-dilly-dallies-on-inflated-zoo-tenders/articleshow/88654773.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Pawar was reacting to Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari’s decision to ask Lokayukta justice V M Kanade to probe the alleged Rs 1,844 crore scam in the BMC’s Ashray Yojana.“The Governor is an important person. He has the right to do what he wants. The CM, the home minister, all of us are constantly on the job to ensure good law and order in the state. We take care that no one will be wronged anywhere. Many complaints come to the Lokayukta. If there is substance in it, then the facts will come out. If there is no truth, people will know that they are making false complaints,” Pawar said. NCP minster Nawab Malik alleged Raj Bhavan has become a political arena. “The Governor is working at the behest of BJP. A letter has been issued to Governor for appointment of 12 MLAs. Why did he not make a decision in this matter?” Malik asked. — Chaintanya Marpakwar||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/truth-will-out-with-lokayukta-probe-into-ashray-yojna/articleshow/88654775.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Most CBSE, ICSE schools in Mumbai defer reopening||MUMBAI: Confusion reigned among schools that open on today after the Christmas break. With no word from the state government, some campuses are welcoming students in, but most, specially ICSE and CBSE schools in Mumbai, have decided to defer throwing open their gates yet again. Moreover, schools that will conduct in-person teaching are expecting a smaller number of students who will walk in. For, several parents who had earlier consented to send their wards to schools after the winter holidays, have retracted their assent. “Almost all the private ICSE schools in Mumbai have decided to defer opening the school for in-person classes by a week. We will continue online schooling, take stock of the situation after a week and then decide whether to open or not,” said Fr Francis Swamy, principal of Campion School. On the other hand, Zeenat Bhojabhoy, principal of Jamnabai Narsee School, said, “We are opening on Monday for parents who may wish to send their children to school. We will be opting for the hybrid mode of school.” She was quick to add that before they closed for the winter break, 30% to 40% had opted to send their wards to school, but the numbers were down considerably after the rising Covid cases. An official from the school education department said that there is no directive to shut down schools. “We have not seen any spike in cases due to re-opening of schools. The increase in cases, except for Mumbai, is not so alarming. Also, the SOP has laid down guidelines to ensure there is no overcrowding in classrooms. Parents have to give consent to send their children to schools, if they are not keen, they can opt for online schooling," said the official. At Podar International School, parents recieved a letter from the school that informed them the school would not open till there was clarity from the state.  The Minister of School Education, Varsha Gaikwad, has convened an emergency meeting of senior officials today to review the plan regarding vaccination of students of Class IX to XII.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/most-cbse-icse-schools-in-city-defer-reopening/articleshow/88654778.cms||Hemali Chhapia

The committee will recommend the names to the state government and the government will send two names to the chancellor. One of these persons will be appointed as the vice chancellor as per the decision of the chancellor,” he said.Earlier, the search committee merely sent the names of the shortlisted candidates to the governor. The amendment also seeks to increase the number of members of the university senate.

Environment minister Aaditya Thackeray tweeted, “Keeping our commitment to clean mobility and encouraging citizens, the Govt of Maharashtra has decided to implement the decision…” To begin with, Mahatma Phule Renewable Energy and Infrastructure Technology Limited (MAHAPREIT) will offer fleet management services from this month, wherein it will supply electric vehicles (on rent) along with charging infra to the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation, said its chairman and managing director Bipin Shrimali on Sunday. “With a key focus on the shift to electric vehicles in government functioning, we are also creating strong infrastructure. For 2022, we have set a roadmap to install 134 EV charging stations across Mumbai, besides having 10 charging stations along the busy Pune Expressway and 70 more on the Mumbai-Nashik-Nagpur national highway NH53," Shrimali said. Each charging station on Nagpur highway will come up on one acre and will have facilities like food malls and parking. The Maharashtra government has also taken a decision to use funds projected to be received under the 15th Finance Commission on electrifying public transport under its EV policy, 2021. The policy aims at bringing at least 1,46,000 new battery-operated electric vehicles (BEVs) on state roads by 2025, estimated to comprise about 10% of all new vehicle registrations by that time.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/state-to-buy-or-rent-only-evs-for-govt-use/articleshow/88654783.cms||Somit Sen

Shared exclusively with TOI, the report shows NCR (Rs 32.7 lakh) ranks third in salaries at the senior job level, but moves between the fifth and sixth positions at the junior and mid levels, while Chennai (Rs 5.6 lakh) ranks third at the junior levels with a variance of around 16% from that of Bengaluru.Among tier-2 cities, Bhubaneswar tops the charts in salary pay-scales in senior level jobs (Rs 31.2 lakh), followed by Kochi (Rs 28.8 lakh) and Chandigarh (Rs 26.5 lakh). Randstad India MD & CEO Viswanath P S said, while the report reveals a significant jump across the board in average salaries of junior, mid- and senior-level professionals, the firm has also captured the emergence of tier-2 cities in 2021. “We firmly believe that they (tier-2) are the future talent hubs and job-creation centres. Our conviction has been borne out by the fact that tier-2 cities have made great strides in salary levels due to a lot of investments in building excellent physical and social infrastructure. This is also a great indication of an exciting trend that is emerging — organisations have discovered the advantages of having a borderless, multi-faceted workforce that can deliver ‘anytime, anywhere’ work. So, we could say that work is seeking out talent in this new model, right up to tier-2 cities,” said Viswanath.Expanding from a traditional textile hub to cover chemicals, pharmaceuticals & healthcare, and now IT, Ahmedabad is only marginally behind the national average salary at mid-to-senior levels. At senior levels, Ahmedabad (Rs 31.9 lakh) pays better than Hyderabad (Rs 29.8 lakh), Chennai (Rs 28.6 lakh) and Kolkata (Rs 28.6 lakh). Mid-level and senior account executives in BFSI are paid the most in Ahmedabad (Rs 8 lakh and 15.3 lakh, respectively) after Kolkata (Rs 12.7 lakh & Rs 27.3 lakh), Mumbai (Rs 9.3 lakh & Rs 19.3 lakh) and NCR (Rs 8.7 lakh & Rs 17 lakh).At the senior level, Bhubaneswar leads the table with an average CTC (Rs 31.2 lakh) that is on par with the median level of tier-1 cities. A key factor fuelling this trend is mining and steel manufacturing companies operating in the city as also the IT/ITeS sector that is gaining prominence with companies setting up offices.In Jaipur, Nagpur, Lucknow, Indore and Coimbatore, the variances are higher in the junior and senior levels. This could be due to the predominance of non-IT industries in these cities, such as manufacturing, engineering and textiles, says the report.Full report on www.toi.in||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/work-seeking-out-talent-up-to-tier-2-cities/articleshow/88654789.cms||Namrata Singh

---||Mumbai||LIC’s IPO pricing may valueit at less than Reliance, TCS||Mumbai: The government is likely to value Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) at a price more conservative than what some analysts had earlier estimated. In fact, some had even forecasted that it would be the most valuable company in India. While the valuation will be in several lakh crore rupees, it will be in single digits, which will place it below companies like Reliance Industries (Rs 16 lakh crore) and TCS (Rs 13.8 lakh crore). However, even at a conservative valuation, the initial public offer (IPO) would be the largest in the country. To encourage policyholders to participate in the IPO, LIC would be issuing shares at a discount to customers. The corporation is keen on policyholder participation as, in future, there will be a shift in the distribution of surplus. Currently, the corporation distributes only 5% of its surplus to shareholders as against the 10% that it is allowed to with the rest being distributed to the policyholders. Conservative pricing would provide a sense of comfort to retail investors.Actuarial firm Milliman has submitted its report on the embedded value of LIC, which will serve as the basis of the pricing. According to insurance industry sources, comparing LIC’s assets under management (AUM) with that of private players would give it a disproportionate valuation. This is because a large chunk of the corporation’s funds represents guaranteed return plans, group insurance funds and superannuation funds of employers. The margins in these businesses are extremely low. Currently, State Bank of India-owned SBI Life Insurance has a market capitalisation of Rs 1.2 lakh crore against assets under management of Rs 2.4 lakh crore. LIC has an AUM that is almost 15 times higher. This had prompted many to assign a value of over Rs 15 lakh crore, which is turning out to be too optimistic, according to actuaries. The corporation is likely to make the embedded value report a part of the draft red herring prospectus, which it will file incorporating first-half results. In the past, when the government had fixed an ambitious pricing for public sector units like General Insurance Corporation and New India Assurance, LIC had to step in and support the issue. This time around, the success of the issue will be incumbent only on market demand.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/lics-ipo-pricing-may-valueit-at-less-than-reliance-tcs/articleshow/88654792.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Mumbai||Chambal’s boy Yash slams 425, 235 & 391||Mumbai: Will India’s next young batting prodigy come from Chambal, which was infamous once for being an area infested with dacoits?Yashwardhan Chouhan, who hails from Chambal, a small town in Madhya Pradesh, has piled up a series of sensational scores while playing for Chambal Division in the under-13 Inter Divisional tournament for AW Kanmadikar Trophy in Indore, organized by the Madhya Pradesh Cricket Association. Turning into an unstoppable run-machine, the 13-year-old right-hander has slammed scores of 47 (vs Ujjain), 425 (248 balls, 87x4, vs Shahdol), 235 (166b, 41x4 vs Bhopal) and 391 vs Indore in the semifinal of the tournament. Overall, he has scored 1091 runs in just 705 balls. Interestingly, he has stroked as many as 197 fours, while not hitting a single six — a proof that the boys prefers hitting the ball along the ground, a rarity in today’s times.The wonderkid’s unbelievable string of scores forced former India wicketkeeper Chandrakant Pandit, currently the Madhya Pradesh head coach, to go to watch him play on Sunday morning. Unfortunately, resuming on 367 overnight, Chouhan was dismissed for 391. “Last night, MPCA secretary Sanjeev Rao called me and asked me to watch this boy play. Since I look after all age group cricket here in MP, it was my duty to have a look at him. He was out to a ball which kept really low. However, he was batting really well. Technically, he looks good, particularly for a 13-year-old. He was playing in the ‘V’ in front of the wicket. If someone is making double hundred, triple hundred and four hundred at the age of 13, it should inspire budding cricketers from around the country. His consistency notching up big scores is amazing. It shows his ability to play a long innings, a good appetite, even at that young an age. It reminds me of a young Sachin Tendulkar and Vinod Kambli, and how their partnership inspired so many cricketers,” Pandit told TOI from Indore.What left Pandit, one of the most successful coaches in domestic cricket, impressed with Chouhan was his approach to the game. “The MPCA CEO Rohit Pandit got me to meet him. I spent 30 minutes with him. I asked him a couple of questions. I asked him: ‘do you feel happy after scoring a hundred? He replied by saying: ‘I like to score as many runs as possible. I don’t like getting out.’ I then asked him: ‘I’ve heard that you have hit so many fours, but no sixes.’ He replied: ‘Why should I try the aerial route when I’m getting runs by hitting along the ground.’ Coming from a 13-year-old, I was really impressed his answers,” praised Pandit. “I don’t know how far he’ll go, but he’s shown his hunger to play a big innings. Even I scored a triple hundred in inter-school cricket, but only once, but I never scored 200, 300 and then a 400! Today, he was out for 391, thus missing out on his second 400-run knock in the tournament. The attack too wasn’t bad,” he said.After his triple hundred, Chouhan took 6 for 46, including a hat-trick, in 17 overs, with his off-spin. The matches in the tournament are being played on a two-day basis in the league stage, and in three-day format from the semifinals onwards.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/chambals-boy-yash-slams-425-235-391/articleshow/88654794.cms||---

Over 2.5 kgs of MD (methaqualone powder) drugs was seized and three persons were arrested last Thursday. The illegal factory was raided just when the drug consignment was on its way for delivery to a farmhouse at Nere village in Panvel taluka. The drug is estimated to be worth Rs 2.53 crore.Those arrested are Kalim Rafiq Khamkar (39), Zaki Afroz Pittu (33) and Subhash Raghupati Patil (40). Based on a tip-off, the Navi Mumbai crime branch unit-3, anti-narcotics cell and human trafficking unit laid a trap to nab Khamkar who was carrying 1.1 kg MD powder in a plastic bag in a car while on his way to deliver it at Nere. His accomplices were also arrested.During police raid, 500 grams each of MD powder was seized from Pittu and Patil while another 500 grams was found kept in a dryer machine. Patil, a BSc chemistry degree holder, had worked in a chemical company and gained expertise in making drugs. He had started making drugs illegally months ago.According to sources, the illegal factory was being run from a farmhouse-like plot in Pezari village which is linked to a high-profile political family from Alibaug. The drug was supposed to be delivered at a farmhouse in Nere for New Year’s Eve party. The farmhouse owner is also under scanner. Police suspicion has further strengthened with the family head of a Pezari political family not returning from his Kashmir trip. The man is a staunch supporter of the politician under scanner. “The progress on the investigation in the drug case will be reviewed on Monday. The owner of the land where the illegal factory was operating will be questioned. Nobody will be spared in this case,” said Suresh Mengade, DCP-crime, Navi Mumbai police.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/navi-mumbai/raigad-politician-under-lens-over-drug-seizure-on-nye/articleshow/88654797.cms||Umesh K Parida
---||Goa||In Ajgaonkar’s Pernem, BJP inducts MGP probable Pravin Arlekar||Panaji: Even as MGP’s probable for the Pernem ticket, Pravin Arlekar, is set to join BJP on Monday, deputy chief minister Manohar Ajgaonkar, who is the governing party’s current legislator from the constituency, is confident of getting the ticket even though his “chances seem bleak”. While the deputy CM has been informed about Arlekar’s joining, he hasn’t been invited for the public meeting at which Arlekar will formally be inducted. Arlekar is the second MGP probable to join BJP after its Mayem candidate, Premendra Shet. Meanwhile, MGP's Pernem unit, shocked by Arlekar's departure, proposed Ajgoankar for the Pernem seat. However, senior MGP functionary Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar said that he is personally against those who are not loyal to their parties. On Arlekar’s decision, Dhavalikar said that the MGP candidate who will join BJP on Monday has betrayed the trust not only of the party but also of the people who supported him in the constituency. He claimed that Arlekar had given in writing that he would not change sides. Dhavalikar, who appeared upset over the loss of his second candidate, the first one being in Mayem, said that he is confident that the voter knows what is happening in the state and will not tolerate this kind of politics. Replying to a question of other probables, Dhavalikar said, “Rajan Korgaonkar is a good man. He is a graduate”. If he joins, then the executive committee will decide. “I will work very hard to ensure that MGP wins the Pernem seat.” Arlekar had earlier denied that he was headed to BJP. State party president Sadanand Shet Tanavade met BJP’s Pernem mandal to inform them about Arlekar’s induction. The karyakartas have been demanding the ticket be given to a local person. Last month, karyakartas from Dhargal demanded the ticket goes to Rajendra Korgaonkar. However, Tanavade said, “Over 70% of BJP’s Pernem mandal support Arlekar’s entry into the party”. Meanwhile, Ajgaonkar said that he formed the CM Pramod Sawant-led BJP government at midnight. “I have confidence in the party, Sawant, Shet and organisation secretary Satish Dhond that they will give me the ticket to contest the 2022 assembly election,” he said. Ajgaonkar said that the party has not invited him to attend Arlekar’s joining ceremony. “If Arlekar joins BJP, it will strengthen the party,” he said. During the 2017 assembly election, Ajgaonkar had contested on the MGP ticket and defeated BJP candidate and former minister Rajendra Arlekar. In March 2019, Ajgaonkar, along with PWD minister Deepak Pauskar, split MGP and joined BJP. A political observer said that wherever the governing has doubts of winning the seat with its incumbent legislator , the party is replacing them by inducting others who are strong in those constituencies. However, the entry of functionaries from other political parties and independents has upset the BJP’s own cadre, which has openly revolted and even threatened to field a party karyakarta as an independent candidate in the upcoming assembly election.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/in-ajgaonkars-pernem-bjp-inducts-mgp-probable-pravin-arlekar/articleshow/88654285.cms||---

The board said that at a time when the state is trying to simplify procedures, the current practice of insisting on NOCs goes against the spirit of ease of doing business and ease of living. “It has been brought to the notice of the government that departments like public works and electricity, which provide utility services, insist on obtaining NOCs from the local panchayats or municipal bodies despite the applicant having obtained the necessary construction licence or occupancy certificate,” chief secretary Parimal Rai stated in the circular even as he instructed all government departments and agencies to discontinue the practice. “It may be noted that insisting upon NOCs from local bodies for providing such utility connections is not mandated under any prevailing law,” Rai added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/noc-from-local-bodies-not-needed-for-utility-connections-ipb/articleshow/88675244.cms||---

Although it has been 22 years since Isro started accepting international customers and has launched 342 foreign satellites from 34 countries, 83% of all such launches it has carried out has come after 2015. This spike in foreign launches also coincides with the beginning of US satellites being put into space by Isro. Between May 1999 and September 2015, Isro, through its commercial arm Antrix Corporation, launched 45 satellites. None from the US. On September 28, 2015, the mission (PSLV-C30) that saw Isro achieve the milestone of launching its 50th foreign satellite was the first time that a satellite from the US was put into orbit by India. The launch involving six foreign satellites — one each from Indonesia and Canada and four from the US — was the first time India launched a satellite from the US. This mission also saw Isro put the country’s first dedicated space telescope, the AstroSat, into orbit. Since that launch, Isro has launched 291 foreign satellites, including three in 2021 — Brazil’s Amazonia-1 and two US satellites — that were launched through the NewSpace India Limited (NSIL), India’s first space PSU that became operational in 2019. While satellites from the US account for 66% or 266 of the 342 launches carried out by India, their share has been much higher when you look at the launched post 2015, at 78%. Aside from the US, the UK and Canada, with 12 satellites each have launched most with India, while Germany, which was among the first countries to partner with Isro, has launched 11 launches using Indian services. Isro Chairman K Sivan said: “The US carries out the most number of commercial launches and unlike many other partners we have, there are a lot of non-governmental launches from the US. And, there are companies that bring such users’ satellites for launch on-board PSLV.” All the 342 foreign satellites India has placed in orbit have been by Isro’s workhorse Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV). After crossing the 50th foreign launch milestone, Isro had said: “Though PSLV was designed to launch Indian remote sensing satellites into polar sun synchronous orbit, the vehicle has repeatedly proved its reliability and versatility by successfully launching satellites into a variety of orbits including polar Sun Synchronous, Geosynchronous Transfer and Low Earth orbits of small inclination, thereby repeatedly proving the robustness of its design.” While India has earned foreign exchange amounting to hundreds of dollars and euros with these launches, NSIL, according to the Centre, has signed six launch service agreements with customers from four countries for launching foreign satellites into space on-board PSLV during 2021-2023. “Foreign exchange revenue of approximately €132 million would be earned through launching these foreign satellites on a commercial basis,” union minister Jitendra Singh had recently said. While this is for the next two years, India has, through launching foreign satellites, earned a foreign exchange revenue of about $35 million and €10 million during the last three (2019-2021) years.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/83-isros-intl-launches-came-post-15/articleshow/88654806.cms||Chethan Kumar

The reason hasn’t been communicated and Oxfam India officials said they are only aware of the information on the MHA website. The denial means the organisation will not be able to receive offshore funds to carry out operations in India from January 2022. “Oxfam India has been working in public interest with the government, communities and frontline workers in the country for decades now. During the pandemic, it joined hands with health departments, district administrations and ASHA workers to provide life-saving equipment and support. The MHA decision will severely hamper these collaborations which have been providing relief to those who need it the most during times of crisis,” said Amitabh Behar, CEO of Oxfam India.The organisation said MHA’s refusal to renew its FCRA registration “will not deter its commitment to serve vulnerable communities in the country and uphold values enshrined in the Indian Constitution”.

In fact, chief minister Basavaraj Bommai set a deadline of 15 days to complete the pothole-filling and relaying exercises, failing which action will be initiated against the joint commissioners. Revenue minister R Ashoka, who briefed media after a meeting, said the CM has set the deadline to fill potholes and repair roads damaged due to heavy rain along 751km. “If it is not met,we will take action against the joint commissioners,” said Ashoka. According to those who attended the meeting, Bommai took the decision to set up two coordination committees — one at the zonal level to ensure smooth development work and stop ad-hoc road-cutting by Bengaluru’s several civic agencies, and another at the state level. In a note released by the CMO, Bommai asked urban development department (UDD) additional chief secretary Rakesh Singh to issue government orders for creation of the two committees. While the zonal-level panel will see representatives of BBMP, Bescom and BWSSB coordinating at the local level along with other agencies, the state-level monitoring committee is likely to be headed by the CM himself along with the chief secretary. Earlier, Ashoka said Bommai has sanctioned Rs 1,500 crore for construction, rectification, rebuilding and cleaning of stormwater drains and that a separate substantial allocation will be made to the new Amrutha Nagarothana scheme for Bengaluru. “A decision on the scheme will be taken up at the next cabinet meeting scheduled for Thursday,” he said. Bommai asked officials to complete TenderSURE roads by March 31, while urging them to expedite whitetopping of stretches without inconveniencing the common man. The CM also directed officials to set up 7,000 CCTV cameras across the city using Nirbhaya funds.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/cm-to-bbmp-officials-fill-potholes-relay-roads-within-15-days-or-face-the-music/articleshow/88654809.cms||---

He alighted near Lalbagh east gate. “I was booking a cab around 6am when two miscreants came on a scooter and snatched my mobile. I fought with them and took back my phone. One of them took out a knife and stabbed me in the stomach, both elbows, and right hand. They snatched my phone and Rs 1,000 cash and fled. But they dropped my mobile accidentally after they noticed some passersby coming to help me,” Mohamed said. He was rushed to a nearby hospital and is said to be out of danger.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/muggers-stab-mumbai-based-techie-near-lalbagh-steal-cash/articleshow/88654811.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||HC allows Lokayukta probe against retd tahsildar in revenue entry case||Bengaluru: The high court has given the go-ahead for a Lokayukta inquiry against a retired tahsildar, who allegedly ordered change in revenue entries in relation to a property, ignoring an interim stay order passed by the deputy commissioner. Dismissing the petition filed by former tahsildar Nagaiah, a division bench headed by justice PS Dinesh Kumar said the Upa Lokayukta and government had come to the prima facie conclusion that the petitioner committed misconduct by violating the interim order and that a departmental inquiry was necessary. “The state government is the employer and the order entrusting the inquiry to the Lokayukta does not suffer from any legal infirmity... the allegation against the petitioner is he ordered change in revenue entries contrary to the interim order passed by the deputy commissioner, which the government has considered as misconduct. Therefore, the contention on alternative remedy is not tenable,” the bench observed. Nagaiah was tahsildar of Bengaluru East taluk (KR Puram) at the time. The mutation entries were made in respect to 2 acres of land at Chikkasandra village, Bidarahalli hobli, in the name of one Muniswamappa and his brother Narayanappa, and 1 acre each was registered in their names. Meanwhile, their sister-in-law Venkatalakshmamma challenged the entries. The assistant commissioner, in an order dated April 24, 2014, allowed the appeal.Bros file revision pleaContesting this order, the two brothers filed a revision petition before the deputy commissioner and obtained an interim stay order on July 10, 2014, and it was communicated to Nagaiah the next day. However, on July 17, 2014, the petitioner changed the khata in Venkatalakshmamma’s name. Thereafter, the matter went to the Lokayukta, following a complaint from the two brothers. A notice was issued to Nagaiah on August 14, 2014.On June 18, 2016, the Upa Lokayukta submitted a report against him recommending departmental inquiry. On August 24, 2016, the government passed an order according sanction and entrusting the departmental inquiry to the Lokayukta. On September 16, 2016, an order appointing an inquiry officer was issued and on November 22, 2016, a notice asking Nagaiah to participate in the inquiry was issued. Nagaiah challenged these orders, contending he had no knowledge about the DC’s interim order. He further claimed the complainants got an alternative remedy available and hence the complaint before Lokayukta is not maintainable.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/hc-allows-lokayukta-probe-against-retd-tahsildar-in-revenue-entry-case/articleshow/88654814.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka’s first LNG terminal inches closer to reality as MoU inked||BENGALURU: Karnataka will soon have its first and the country’s sixth liquified natural gas (LNG) terminal. This is part of the Centre’s larger plan to boost the alternative fuel market to achieve net zero carbon by 2070. An MoU has been signed between the state government and Singapore-based LNG Alliance company, in association with New Mangalore Port Trust (NMPT). The project, with an investment of Rs 2,250 crore, is likely to be launched in the next two years with “minimal” land acquisition and usage of NMPT premises where there’s a dedicated LNG terminal. The company is close to registering its India arm under the name Shakti LNG to manage operations in Karnataka. LNG Alliance said the potential for LNG use in the state is about 2 million tonnes per annum (MTPA), with further expansion likely to create a demand for a whopping 8 MTPA. The project, once completed, will supply LNG to a 300km radius around Mangaluru, with the company considering the option of ISO tankers supplying gas for industrial and transportation use in hinterlands of the state and also for shipping activity along the west coast as part of the Sagarmala initiative. “This will be India’s first dedicated LNG bunkering facility that will provide LNG as fuel for ships through small-scale bunkering shuttles to the west coast, ensuring coastal connectivity and aligned with the Sagarmala initiative,” said LNG Alliance. Karnataka, which is struggling to attract big investors because of the pandemic, is buoyant with the project becoming closer to reality. “LNG Alliance has decided to set up its state-of-the-art terminal after seeing our industry-friendly policy and investment ecosystem. The project will create employment opportunities and generate more than 200 direct jobs. The MoU with LNG Alliance is another major milestone for the state,” said industries commissioner Gunjan Krishna.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/states-first-lng-terminal-inches-closer-to-reality-as-mou-inked/articleshow/88654815.cms||Sandeep Moudgal

Driver Siddappa told police the robbery took place between 3am and 4.30am on December 30 when he was transporting goods in his truck. His family members were also out of station.

---||Bengaluru||Active Covid-19 cases cross 10,000 for first time since October 10; Bengaluru accounts for 84%||BENGALURU: The number of active Covid-19 cases in Karnataka, which has been consistently declining since September 2021, has breached the 10,000-mark again, for the first time since October 10. The number of patients under treatment had continued to dip from September 2021, touching 8,644 on October 31 and 6,574 on December 1, 2021. By January 1, 2022, however, such cases stood at 9,386, crossing the 9,000 mark for the first time since mid-October 2021 before reaching 10,292 on Sunday. However, health department officials reiterated that the number of people needing hospitalisation is still very low both in Bengaluru and across the state when compared to the first and second waves. On preparations to tackle the increasing number of cases, Anil Kumar TK, principal secretary, health & family welfare, told TOI the government has ramped up the number of ICU beds, oxygen cylinders and essential drugs to prepare in case of a third wave but did not give specific numbers. “...These facilities have been placed on stand-by and will be made operational within a week should the situation go awry. However, I do not want to speculate on the possibility of a third wave,” he said when asked if the government foresees another Covid-19 mass outbreak happening. The number of infections is on the rise after a brief brush with pre-Covid normalcy, with Bengaluru alone dealing with 8,671 active cases as of Sunday, which is 84% of the overall active cases in the state. The last time Bengaluru had more than 8,000 active cases was in mid-August. By the end of September, the number had dipped to below 7,500, and further touched 6,531 on October 31. By the end of November, it was under 6,000 and stood at 4,925 as of December 1. After the capital city, Dakshina Kannada district stands second with 231 active cases, followed by Udupi (194), Kodagu (131), Mysuru (129) and Ballari (122). Together, these six districts, with Bengaluru Urban in the lead, account for 92% of the 10,292 active cases in Karnataka. Despite the growing numbers, data on the Omicron variant has loosely established that those infected with this new strain do not necessarily need hospitalisation or emergency medical care. Experts also say that overall hospitalisation has also reduced because the state has also managed to vaccinate a good percentage of the targeted adult population in the earlier drives. Vaccination data as of 6pm on Sunday shows that nearly 78% of the more than 4.9 crore eligible people across the state have been administered both doses. In Bengaluru, 76.5% or more than 80.3 lakh have been given both doses out of the nearly 1.1 crore eligible people. Similarly, Dakshina Kannada has administered both doses to 77% of the eligible population, while it is 84% in Udupi, 93% in Kodagu, 82.5% in Mysuru and 73.5% in Ballari.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/active-cases-cross-10000-for-first-time-since-oct-10-bluru-accounts-for-84/articleshow/88654819.cms||Sanika Athavale
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru couples sue agency for excluding Burj Khalifa from package, win Rs 65,000||BENGALURU: Lured by a Dubai tour package promising visits to the top floor of Burj Khalifa and Ferrari World theme park and desert safari with barbeque, two Bengaluru couples paid Rs 59,000 per head only to find that not only was the trip duration reduced but also major attractions were not covered. They took the operator to a consumer court and won Rs 15,000 each as compensation and Rs 5,000 towards litigation expenses. Gireesh S Konasali, 31, and his wife Rashmi M, 29, of Guttahalli and Yogesh M, 27, and his wife Tulsi YR, 28, of Malleswaram decided to take a pleasure trip to Dubai in October 2019 and booked one with TravBond Tour Agency. The representative promised them four nights and five days in the Gulf, including visits to Burj Khalifa, The Dubai Mall and Ferrari World theme park along with desert safari. TravBond demanded they pay Rs 53,000 per head and the cost was later escalated to Rs 59,000 each. The couples paid the amount towards tickets, visa, accommodation and sightseeing expenses. But the agency failed to share with them the itinerary despite repeated queries. Finally, hours before their travel to Dubai on January 18, 2020, a TravBond executive shared the itinerary with Gireesh, Rashmi, Yogesh and Tulsi. The quartet was shocked to know that the five-day trip was cut short to three days, and Burj Khalifa and Ferrari World were not on the itinerary. Cornered into embarking on the journey at the last moment, the Bengalureans flew to the Gulf and were forced to pay for all the tour attractions from their pocket despite having shelled out Rs 2.4 lakh in advance. The couples returned to Bengaluru and filed a complaint against the general manager of TravBond Tour Agency in Delhi and the branch manager of its office in Church Street, Bengaluru with the Bengaluru Rural and Urban 1st Additional District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, accusing them of unfair trade practices. The travel agency lawyer claimed the complaint was false and an attempt to make wrongful gain from a reputed firm. The attorney said no false assurances about the Gulf trip were given to the couples and attractions like Burj Khalifa and Ferrari World were never included in the itinerary as claimed by them. The consumer court judges, however, noted that the exhibits produced by the couples clearly showed that the world’s tallest building and Ferrari World theme park were included in the tour attractions. The forum reprimanded the travel agency for making the false declarations and giving a tough time to the travellers, including a pregnant woman. In their verdict pronounced on December 7, 2021, the judges ruled that the general manager of TravBond and the branch manager of its Bengaluru office must pay a compensation of Rs 15,000 each to all the four complainants for unfair trade practices apart from Rs 5,000 towards their court expenses, all within six months of the order.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/couples-sue-agency-for-excluding-burj-khalifa-from-package-win-65k/articleshow/88654820.cms||Petlee Peter
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Four years on, Bhattarahalli Lake revival work not over yet||BENGALURU: Bhattarahalli Lake near KR Puram is still waiting to be completely rejuvenated by the civic body. Members of the group working for betterment of the lake said rejuvenation work on the 18-acre water body commenced in early 2017 and is yet to be completed. Balaji Raghotham, member of the lake group, said, “There are several issues including encroachment, problems with the inlet and outlet drains, no place for locals to walk and more. BBMP has been promising to complete the work at the earliest but it is far from completion as we see it.” Residents said the walkway provided by the Palike gets slushy every time it rains and that they have to wait for a day or two before they can venture out for their morning walks again. Aravind M, a volunteer who lives close to the lake, said: “It is not possible to walk inside even otherwise as there is no fence. Many two-wheelers use the path around the water body. Also, volunteers have carried out several tree-plantation drives and in the absence of a fence around the lake, cattle and other stray animals tend to feed on the saplings.” BBMP, however, claimed all core developmental works from their end is done. Work on fencing hasn’t been possible for a long time due to the presence of a notified slum in the lake area. “We can’t call the slum an encroachment, at the same time we cannot fence the lake for the same reason,” a BBMP official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/4-yrs-on-bhattarahalli-lake-revival-work-not-over-yet/articleshow/88654821.cms||Mrinalini Bhat

While there were 95 such zones on December 26, the number rose to 125 eight days later (on January 2). During this period, the number of daily infections in the city went up from 248 to 923. Although the number of micro-containment zones increased in the first week of December, it saw a slight dip post mid-December. Houses or buildings with three or more cases of Covid-19 are declared micro-containment zones. The purpose of this is to contain further spread of the virus into a cluster. More than one micro-containment zone is declared a cluster. However, none of the existing micro-containment zones has Omicron cases since such patients are hospitalised as a precautionary measure. Bommanahalli zone, since October, has consistently had the highest number of micro-containment zones in the city. As on January 2, Bommanahalli had 38 such zones, followed by Mahadevapura with 35, south zone 15, east 12, Yelahanka 11, west 10 and RR Nagar 1. Dasarahalli zone that did not have a micro-containment zone for several weeks now has three. As on January 1, there were 110 micro-containment zones housing 419 active cases and including 877 households. Over 50% are in apartments. When there are over 20 cases in the same location, BBMP declares it a cluster. “We don't have the exact count of clusters. The number of micro-containment zones only indicates BBMP is trying its best to contain spread of infections,” Palike chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta said. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/micro-containment-zones-up-to-125-in-8-days/articleshow/88654822.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka has enough Covaxin to jab 60% of targeted teens||BENGALURU: Karnataka, which is set to kickstart the vaccination drive targeting children aged between 15 and 18 beginning Monday, already has enough Covaxin doses to cover nearly 60% of the 31 lakh youngsters in the target group. As per the Centre, the second dose can only be administered after 28 days of receiving the first. Arundathi Chandrasekhar, managing director, National Health Mission (NHM), told TOI the government had a stock of 18 lakh Covaxin doses. “These will be administered at schools and pre-university colleges across Karnataka,” she said. Of the 31 lakh people in this age group, the government has set a target of covering 6 lakh on the first day — January 3 — which is expected to see as many as 4,000 sessions. As per the Centre’s guidelines, those born during and before 2007 are eligible. The state health department said schools and colleges will be the vaccination centres and provide support staff and space for vaccination. Those children who may miss their session at schools/colleges will be directed to the nearby health centres to get the dose. “Vaccination for children with comorbidities will be carried out in a health facility under the supervision of a medical officer,” a statement issued by the department reads. Children who have dropped out of schools will be gathered and mobilised to government hospitals with the support of the labour, rural development and panchayat raj (RDPR) and urban development departments. “The Indian Academy of Paediatrics and other private paediatricians have been asked to provide complete support to this vaccination drive, especially for children with anxiety, apprehension and other mental conditions,” the statement added. The note read that those schools which are conducting only online classes can fix a day for vaccination and children have to be called on that particular day to avail the dose.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/ktaka-has-enough-covaxin-to-jab-60-of-targeted-teens/articleshow/88654823.cms||---

DIG Garhwal Karan Singh Nagnyal said that the SIT is headed by Dehradun SP (rural) Kamlesh Upadhyay and has one circle officer, one inspector and two sub-inspectors as its members. “The decision to form the SIT was taken since the issue is sensitive and there was a demand for independent investigation in it,” he said. The move to form the SIT comes a day after members of the Muslim community took out marches in Dehradun and Haridwar, demanding an SIT probe into the case, a suspension order for a policeman found sharing a laugh with accused seers and immediate arrest of organisers and participants of the conclave. Till now, Haridwar Police was investigating the case. Five persons, including the organiser of the conclave Yati Narsinghanand, have been booked but no arrests have been made yet.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/five-member-sit-formed-to-probe-haridwar-dharam-sansad-hate-speech/articleshow/88653388.cms||Gaurav Talwar
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu aim to help Foxconn fix things||CHENNAI: When reports about labour unrest trickled in from i-phone maker Foxconn’s facility at Sriperumbudur late last month, the Tamil Nadu government moved in swiftly. With a grand agenda to make Tamil Nadu a $1 trillion economy by 2030, the state could not afford to send any wrong signal to global investors even though the issue was only between the company’s contractors and a section of the workers over the food served and living conditions. For the record, Tamil Nadu has the largest number of employees in the organised sector across the country. The state always had good industrial relations that came in handy to market it as a destination for global investors. Soon after getting wind of the unrest, the state directed the district administration and police to immediately take stock of the situation. Senior industry department officials reached out to Indian representatives in Taiwan and their counterparts here. “Nobody is finding fault with the state government, be it the workers or the management. They felt the government functioned as a fair arbiter,” a senior state government official told TOI. Foxconn had gone on the record to accept its mistake in ramping up production too fast.“There is no complaint against wages or food served in the factory canteen, but against the food served and living conditions in the hostel managed by contractors. Foxconn too, having spent huge money to get things in place through contractors, failed to monitor them,” the official said. The process is now on with the district collectors forming committees and officials inspecting the sites, certifying the hostels based on safety and hygiene and limiting the number of women assigned per room. "We have told them not to restart production until all the conditions are fulfilled,” minister for rural industries T M Anbarasan, who visited the spot the previous Saturday, told TOI on Sunday. There are always fringe elements, who try to exploit an issue, said an official “That is something, as an administration or government, we cannot permit. That is something we will monitor and act on in an appropriate fashion,” the official said. “We will continue to support both the employer and the workers and will play the role of a facilitator to make sure that we keep the investment environment in a condition that ensures more people are happy to come and do business with Tamil Nadu,” the official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/tn-aim-to-help-foxconn-fix-things/articleshow/88654825.cms||D Govardan

---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: ‘Adyar, Cooum waters still polluted’||CHENNAI: Despite efforts, there is no significant improvement in the water quality of Cooum and Adyar rivers, the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) has told the National Green Tribunal (NGT). According to the inspection report of TNPCB, dated December 16, 2021, high levels of toxic pollutants and heavy metals were found in the water samples collected from the rivers near Alandur and Thirumangalam. Between March and September, the board collected samples from 12 different locations along the Adyar and Cooum rivers. Lab test results of these samples indicated that all of them had high levels of Ammo-Nitrogen (a toxic pollutant), conductivity, indicating the presence of salts and heavy metals, and Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), the report said. High BOD indicates that the polluted water will have harmful effects on human and marine lives. The TNPCB has directed Chennai Metro Water Supply and Sewerage Board (CMWSSB) to complete pending sewerage works soon. CMWSSB under the Chennai River Restoration Trust (CRRT) project proposed to stop pollution in these rivers by adopting a two-pronged approach. First, it wanted to provide underground sewer connections to all houses and commercial establishments in unsewered locations along the banks of these rivers in the city. Second, it tried to create enough sewage treatment plants (STPs) at appropriate locations. By this, the CMWSSB was optimistic that all the wastewater, flowing through their underground networks will reach their STPs for treatment (removing contaminants) before being let into the rivers. But till now, only 71% of the works have been completed in and around Alandur and Thirumangalam, where pollution was rampant forcing the tribunal to take a suo motu cognizance of this issue in January 2021. At present, there are 27 STPs within the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) limits, and out of this, 14 are still under construction, according to CMWSSB data. Even the 13 STPs, which are under operation, were not utilised to their fullest potential. While these plants can treat 745 million litres of sewage per day, nearly one-fourth remains underutilised. The NGT Southern Zone has directed CMWSSB to submit a report on the progress made on these lines before the case comes up for hearing on January 31.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/adyar-cooum-waters-still-polluted/articleshow/88654827.cms||Ram Sundaram
---||Chennai||Chennai: Albino migrant duck spotted in Pallikaranai||CHENNAI: Birders were in for a pleasant surprise when they spotted a white-coloured duck (Spatula querquedula) in Pallikaranai marshland. Experts confirmed that the bird was an albino garganey. Nature Trust founder K V R K Thirunaranan said one of his team members B Ajith, a Presidency College student, took the pictures of the bird in Pallikaranai on December 19. “Later on, it was shared online, and its identity was confirmed,” he said.  “While watching a large flotilla of ducks at Pallikaranai marshland, one white bird among the garganeys caught the attention of our team members. This bird was smaller in size when compared to shovelers. Except for its body colour, other features such as eyes, tail, and legs of this duck were same as that of garganey.” A similar bird was sighted in Odisha’s Chillika lake in 2016, he said. Garganeys are winter migrants, which travel from Russia, to reach southern peninsular India. Ornithologists from Bombay Natural History Society had recovered 100 garganeys that flew from Russia to various wetlands in the state. These had rings on one of their legs. When the details in these rings were inspected, the ornithologists found out that the birds had flown from Russia. These birds were earloer recorded in Uri in J&K, Bharatpur in Rajasthan, Point Calimere bird’s sanctuary in Vedharanyam, and Thondi in Tamil Nadu.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/albino-migrant-duck-spotted-in-pallikaranai/articleshow/88654828.cms||P Oppili

The shed at ward 124 in Zone 9 (Teynampet), where about 240 vehicles from various wards are parked, saw water stagnation up to three feet. This caused a delay in garbage collection in some of the wards in Teynampet. Vehicles from other zones were diverted to collect the garbage later. When TOI visited this shed on Sunday, all the damaged vehicles were seen parked. There were also yellow markings of rain-water levels on the walls. A resident from Zone 9, who faced a delay in garbage collection, meanwhile has raised this issue on Corporation’s Namma Chennai app. Ramesh R, in his complaint, had said garbage was not collected in his locality and when he questioned the local ward sanitary inspector, he was told the vehicles were damaged in the shed. His complaint was forwarded to the Assistant Engineer of the ward. A staff monitoring the shed said they were not informed about the weather updates on December 30. “This is a low-lying area. The vehicles were shifted during November to another shed as there was prior communication on weather,” he said. A fleet staff, who was in the shed, said the batteries of the vehicles were damaged and the engineers were deployed to repair them. Attempts to contact Urbaser Sumeet for official comments did not get any response. However, the cost of such battery-operated vehicles ranges from Rs 1 to 2 lakh. Corporation officials said they have informed the zones to manage the waste collection without any delay.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/rain-damages-150-battery-run-garbage-collection-vehicles/articleshow/88654829.cms||Omjasvin M D

Last month, Bhakyaraj 35, a farmer from the Cauvery delta, returned for a final check-up and to thank the doctors who cured him of rhino-orbital mucormycosis or the post-Covid complication called black fungus.  The treatment cost 25 lakh and half of it was borne by the government under Chief Minister’s Health Insurance Scheme and a half of it was sourced through an NGO, by the government. Bhakyaraj, a diabetic, was shifted from the Thanjavur general hospital to the RGGGH when his condition deteriorated. The specialists at the Chennai hospital had to deal with five life-threatening complications.  Interventional radiologist Dr S Kalpana said the main arteries leading to the brain were dilated. “We could not place a normal stent since the ballooning was longer than usual. We had to purchase two flow diverters costing 20 lakh. These are thinner stents that ensure smooth supply through the arteries. Aneurysm was treated by placing coils,” she said. The doctors accessed the blood vessels through a 5mm incision in the patient’s hip. The whole process monitored by digital subtraction Angiography. The intervention was done on October 15 and the patient was discharged on October 26.  RGGGH dean Dr E Theranirajan said the patient came back for a check-up on December 6 and he was doing fine. “The person’s life was saved because of the timely management by interventional radiology and other specialists at the RGGGH, along with support by the government,” he said. Bhakyaraj’s wife, in a video message, said she did not have words to thank the government and doctors, who caured such a life-threatening illness free of cost. More than 10 specialists, nurses, anaesthetists and health care assistants from various departments were involved in the treatment.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/how-gh-saved-man-from-jaws-of-black-fungus/articleshow/88654830.cms||Omjasvin M D

The court directed the manufacturers to pay the arrears from April 2020 onwards within two months. The directions were in response to a petition from K Ponraj, President of Salt labourers’ union (CITU), Tuticorin. According to his petition, the state government had revised the wage structure of salt workers from April 2020 at the rate of 466 per day including weekly holidays. However, the manufacturers continued to pay 405 to male workers and 395 to female workers, which is less than the minimum wages fixed by the government and there cannot be variation in pay among male and female workers, the petitioner contended. There are about 20,000 labourers working in the salt pans in Tuticorin. The presiding officer, P Murugan ruled in favour of the labourers and directed the manufacturers to adhere to the wage revision prescribed by the Tamil Nadu government and also directed the manufacturers to compensate 10,000 to the petitioner uniocn. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/city-court-wants-salt-workers-paid-revised-wages/articleshow/88654831.cms||---

Three streets in Teynampet, behind Stella Mary’s College, have been underwater for the last three days. Apart from the inundated rainwater, the reverse flow of sewage has added to the woes of about 5,000 families living in Muthiah Street, Babu Street, and Elliamman Kovil Street. The streets are submerged in sewage water emanating a stink.  When TOI visited this locality on Sunday, it found the stormwater drain was not functioning. The civic body had deployed two pumps to send the water into the stormwater drains along Cathedral Road through hose pipes that are ten meters long. The residents are finding it difficult to step out of their homes to even buy groceries as they are afraid of potholes and electrocution. Bhagyam M from Babu street, said they have not stepped out of their house for the last three days. “There’s ankle-deep water mixed with sewage. It’s not flowing anywhere and with two motors, it may take a week for all the water to get pumped out,” she said.  The Corporation officials admitted that the SWD built does not have a proper gradient to remove the water. “We will add more pumps here. We have also informed the Metrowater to fix the drainages to stop the reserve flow of sewage,” the official added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/three-teynampet-streets-in-heart-of-city-still-flooded-by-rainwater/articleshow/88654832.cms||Omjasvin M D

Stating that the drug menace especially near educational institutions, crimes against children, road traffic accidents, and cybercrimes would be the specific challenges for the year ahead, he said that the law and order was well preserved, crime investigation was remarkable and enforcement work was efficient due to the dedication and tireless efforts of the officers. In a circular, the DGP expressed concern over incidents of custodial violence and non-registration of crimes. “It is the responsibility of every unit officer to lead by example in terms of absolute integrity, personal courage, stern countenance, and pure professional ethics. Officers shall desist from doing anything that is unbecoming of a member of this dignified force,” he said. The force has risen to the occasion to fight the monster of caste related murders in the south, and the revenge rowdy murders in the north. 'Operation rowdy Vettai 'resulted in the arrest of 3,325 suspects under various sections of law and confiscation of 1,117 dangerous weapons. The drive against drugs (DAD) crackdown netted an all-time high seizure of contrabands. The involvement of the Tamil Nadu Police in the war against Covid-19 is gauged by the death of 139 police personnel because of the Covid infection in the second wave of the pandemic. The DGP also thanked the government of Tamil Nadu for granting the one-day weekly off to the constabulary through an amendment in the PSO.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/drug-menace-cyber-crimes-on-police-agenda-in-2022-tn-dgp/articleshow/88654833.cms||---

Starting December 20, fresh cases have risen steadily across the city. All city zones have recorded a 30% rise in cases with Anna Nagar, Teynampet, Kodambakkam, Royapuram, Adyar and Valsaravakkam seeing the steepest rise in the past one week. Reaons have been smaller gatherings and lack of enforcement of covid protocols in the public places during the Christmas and New Year celebrations. 'The civic body has decided to engage 1,000 volunteers, five for each ward. These workers will go from door to door to check people for infections and ensure that home quarantine patients follow protocols. The decision was taken at a meeting headed by health minister Ma Subramanian. The civic body will now focus more on the home quarantine patients as the new variant has only fever and sore throat as symptoms. Quarantine stickers will be back too, with the volunteers mandated to assist patients through the entire-checkup process and help them with all requirements until they are treated. Gagandeep Singh Bedi, corporation commissioner, said that they will re-open 22 screening centres. “Five are functioning now. Since colleges and schools cannot be used, we are looking at alternative sites. By Tuesday, they will be opened for public," he said. The corporation has announced that the Chennai Trade Centre will be turned into a Covid care centre with 800 beds. Telecounselling centres, one per zone, will also be up and running by Tuesday, he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/civic-body-revisits-strategy-to-test-more-step-up-surveillance/articleshow/88654836.cms||Komal Gautham

Due to a spike in cases, the state government has reversed its decision to resume normal classes for Class IX to XII from January 3, apart from barring physical classes for Class I to VIII till January 10. While asking schools to conduct physical classes for Class IX to XIII, the school education department asked schools to maintain protocols like 20 students per classroom, face masks and staggered breaks. Due to non-availability of space and teachers, some schools are planning to call students in batches while others are planning to call 50% students to avoid over-crowding. V Shanthi, headmistress of Vidyodaya Girls Higher Secondary School in T Nagar, said, the school may call 50% students from Class IX to XII for physical classes to maintain the 20 students per classroom norm. M Sathish Kumar, principal of Vana Vani Matriculation Higher Secondary School, (IIT-M campus), said, the school will divide students of Class IX to XII into two batches to maintain social distancing inside classrooms. “Class IX and XI students will attend physical classes whenever Class X, XII do not have tests. During the test days, they will attend classes online,” he said. GRT Mahalakshmi Vidyalaya Matriculation Higher Secondary School in Ashok Nagar is planning to work only till 1pm to avoid students having lunch and mixing with other students. "We have arranged two students in a row and plan to work only till 1pm. Students will not be permitted to have lunch at schools," said Agnes Rita, principal of the school. Most schools have scheduled online classes for Class I to VIII. Schools with more students like Everwin Matriculation Higher Secondary School in Kolathur are planning to employ additional teachers and conduct daily classes for Classes IX to XII. Colleges are preparing students for offline semester exams from January 20. "We have completed syllabus for second and third year students. Still about 20% of syllabus need to be completed for first year students. If Covid-19 cases continue to rise, we can conduct physical mode exams by extending number of exam days. We can conduct semester exams yearwise by following all Covid protocols," said S Santhosh Baboo, principal of DG Vaishnav College. Professors warned the degrees may not be valued by the recruiters if the state government again go back to online mode of exams.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/schools-plan-to-call-half-their-students-to-avoid-over-crowding-clusters/articleshow/88654837.cms||A Ragu Raman

The popular tourist hotspot of Mamallapuram was teeming with travellers largely from Chennai and neighbouring districts even as cases continue to spike across the state.  Scores of visitors who explored the ticketed monuments ignored the mandatory mask rule at public places. The situation at Kovalam beach was no different. The tourist hotspot was flocked by hundreds of people without masks and social distancing. Footfall at the beach was high on Sunday with cars parked on both sides of the road leading to the promenade. This caused massive traffic snarls. There was poor enforcement of Covid-19 protocols in both these places. While about 5,000 people visited ticketed monuments of ASI on Friday, the number spiked to around 12,000 on Saturday. The TTDC's houseboat at Muttukadu recorded a footfall of 2,000 visitors on Saturday and Sunday. Mamallapuram-based tourist guide R Stalin said that nine out of ten visitors to Mamallapuram on Sunday did not wear masks. Meanwhile, ASI sources said that entry into the monuments was not allowed without masks, and that people remove their masks once the enter the main gate of the monument. When contacted, Chengalpet district collector A R Rahul Nadh said special teams comprising revenue and police department and the local body have been formed to ensure that Covid protocols are not violated at tourist hotspots.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/masks-find-no-takers-among-visitors-to-mamallapuram/articleshow/88654838.cms||---

The annual sale was particularly high in 2021 at Rs 30,222 crore, when compared to Rs 23,000 crore in 2020 Of the five days, December 31 resulted in Rs 172 crore in sales as 1.6 lakh cases of Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) and 1.5 lakh cases of beer were sold on the last day. The one-day sales in 2020 was higher at Rs 193 crore on December 31, but the overall target set by excise officials was met in 2021, overjoyed officials said. The highest sale was on December 27, at Rs 202 crore as people stocked alcohol to celebrate the New Year. However, many liquor store owners were unhappy with sales, claiming that government revenue was met because the stock was lifted by them, but over-the-counter sales were down. “Over-the-counter sales were reduced primarily due to Covid-19 concerns, and permission for New Year events was unclear until the last minute, a store owner said. According to sources, sales in January could be lower because many stocks are still unsold.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/t-toasts-2021-with-record-925-cr-liquor-sales-in-years-last-5-days/articleshow/88654840.cms||Sribaala Vadlapatla

However, data from health department on registrations shows the initiative is yet to pick up pace. As on Sunday night, only around 4,000 of around seven lakh eligible across Greater Hyderabad and Rangareddy had booked their vaccination slots through the CoWin portal. Around five lakh of the eligible population under the 15-18 age group are from the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) area while another 2.33 lakh are from Rangareddy district. According to officials, only around three thousand from the age-group in Greater Hyderabad and around 400 from Rangareddy district had been registered as of 9 pm on Sunday. While the state health department had initially announced that the vaccine would be administered to the newly-eligible group only through government facilities, they have now told private hospitals that they can also administer the vaccine if they have Covaxin doses in stock. As per the Centre’s current guidelines, only Covaxin doses are to be administered to the 15-18 age group. As a last minute change, health authorities also permitted walk-ins for administration of the Covid-19 vaccine. “We have made elaborate arrangements to ensure that anyone who faces difficulties entering their details into the CoWin portal, can walk into a vaccination centres and have their details entered,” a senior health department official explained. Officials have also been directed to work closely with schools and colleges to ensure maximum vaccine coverage. “We made the slots available on the CoWin portal on Saturday evening. We are now hoping that registrations will grow gradually over the next few days as many parents would like to wait and see how the vaccine works,” another top health department official said. Doctors and paediatricians across the state are advising parents to have their children vaccinated, especially in the wake of the rising number of Omicron cases. “The virus is highly unpredictable but there is no need to panic,” said Dr Kachan S Channawar, a paediatrician at Kamineni Hospital. “However, for the next four weeks, caution is required. Vaccination and use of masks are critical,” the doctor said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/slow-registration-of-slots-ahead-of-15-18-vax-drive/articleshow/88654841.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The finance department said that if cost escalations exceed the expenditure sanction by more than 10%, a revised expenditure sanction will have to be sought from the finance department. However, cost escalations will be permitted only if the cost of the project is more than Rs 2 crore and if the time frame for project completion is more than four months. The special relaxation for cost escalations will be in force for a one year period or till the state government decides to withdraw it. “The department will be allowed to exceed the expenditure sanction up to 10% without referring to the finance department. In case the revised expenditure sanction on account of this notification exceeds 10% of the original sanction amount, it will be submitted to the finance department for accord of revised expenditure sanction,” said chief electrical engineer Raghuvir Keni. The relaxation and delegation of powers to accept revised expenditure sanctions comes based on recommendations of a special committee constituted by the state government to study the shortage of labour and non-availability of material as a result of the lockdown and the restrictions thereafter, due to the increase in Covid-19. Since the start of the pandemic, the prices of raw materials has shot up exponentially and many contractors have approached the government seeking an upward revision in the contract costs. The state is trying to find a way to expeditiously complete various infrastructure projects that are incomplete due to this. “The state government has considered and accepted the recommendations of the committee to provide relief. Concurrence of the finance department came on December 23,” said a government official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/10-cost-escalation-for-power-projects-allowed-without-need-for-fresh-sanction/articleshow/88654270.cms||TNN

For this, the apex body has alerted 4,300 RWAs under it, through social media by updating their Covid-19 SOPs.“We have told RWA presidents and secretaries concerned to follow similar procedures to the ones implemented during the first and second waves in the interest of residents’ safety,” UFERWAS executive vice-president, Major (retd) Shiv Kiran, told TOI.RWAs have been instructed to keep ready a list of doctors and medical staff residing in their areas, approach them if people are detected with Omicron, and take help in ensuring the patients are either put in home isolation or admitted to hospitals. As per UFERWAS representatives, while the exact number of people who have not taken both doses is not known, it is estimated that around 10-20 per cent residents are yet to complete their two doses of the Covid-19 vaccine.“RWAs should take assistance from the state health department, GHMC and NGOs to tackle the present situation and keep track of officials, emergency numbers among others to avail ambulance services of both private and government hospitals when in need,” a UFERWAS member said.“In fact, the government is telling people that wearing masks is mandatory. People in apartment buildings, gated communities and other housing schemes must follow this strictly. Security personnel and other workers operating in the premises must also adhere strictly to these norms,” said Harshvardhan, an RWA representative from Secunderabad. “It is also advisable not to go back to your home towns over Sankranti and visiting shrines for Vaikunta Dwaram darshan in light of the current situation,” said another UFERWAS member.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/rwa-body-directs-colonies-to-ensure-full-vax-coverage/articleshow/88654844.cms||Sunil Mungara

Arrangements have been made to administer doses to 150 to 200 beneficiaries per day. “We have enough vaccine vials,” said the health department official. The beneficiaries have to visit health centres along with registered phones.

Also, wearing masks at all times around other people has been emphasised.This particular variant has a doubling rate of less than two days, which means the number of patients getting infected could double in two days flat. While so far around 80 Omicron positive cases have been detected in the state, largely among international passengers who had returned to the state and were tested at Rajiv Gandhi International Airport, genome sequencing was not being conducted on samples elsewhere. “These positive cases are from less than 200 samples, which means every second Covid-19 positive sample taken at the airport had tested positive in the genome sequencing,” a source at RGI Airport said. State health authorities have, meanwhile, said that it was not possible to do many genome sequencing tests and it could be assumed that the new variant would spread rapidly. “The country has around 50 labs that can perform genome sequencing. Hence, it is not possible to test every suspect.

An additional 170 acre for CCI township and 1,500 acre for 48 million tonnes limestone deposits was also available. “There is required water and 2 KVL electricity supply for the unit,” he added. “Reopening of CCI unit will not just help Telangana but also neighbouring states, including Maharashtra.

Will he continue to stay in hiding in Telangana as he has been doing over the last 20 days or make a large withdrawal to travel somewhere else? Police are keeping their fingers crossed on his next move. The 21-year-old jawan, B Sai Kiran Reddy of Siddipet district, who has been missing since December 6, withdrew all his money soon after. The small amounts that his family deposited in his accounts was also used by him. His salary is expected to be credited into his account soon and cops are hoping for a fresh lead to track him through ATM transactions. “We are sparing no effort to trace him. We have been tracking every movement and we are getting to know where he is withdrawing money. But he has been elusive. He has been trying to hide. He has neither reported for work at Faridkot at his unit nor contacted his family or friends,” Husnabad ACP Satish told TOI. Sai, who is from Pothireddypalli in Cheriyal of Siddipet, left Hyderabad by flight to Delhi on December 5. The following day he was supposed to report at his unit in Fardikot but got down from train at Bhatinda and took a cab back to Delhi. He then surfaced in Telangana. Police found that he had withdrawn money from ATMs in Karimnagar, Narsampet and Warangal. The last lead was in Bhadrachalam where he withdrew the small amounts which his family had deposited at the suggestion of the police.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/cops-counting-on-missing-jawans-pay-for-fresh-lead/articleshow/88654849.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

The deceased, V Narasimha Reddy, was a worker of Mahalakshmi steel and cement shop in Badangpet. It was Narasimha Reddy’s birthday on Saturday and in the afternoon he left home to meet friends. On Saturday night, Narasimha Reddy’s friend, Md Ghouse, called his family members to inform them that a group of people have assaulted them while they were consuming liquor at an open place behind KK Garden in LB Nagar and during the assault, Narasimha Reddy fell unconscious. “Narasimha Reddy’s family rushed to the spot and shifted him to a nearby hospital. He was declared brought dead,” LB Nagar inspector V Ashok Reddy said. Subsequently, Narasimha Reddy’s brother Hanumantha Reddy lodged a complaint with police alleging that his brother was assaulted by Manik, his brother Goutham, their associates Mittu, Manoj and Raghava. Based on the complaint, police registered a case and launched an investigation. During the initial probe, police found that Narasimha Reddy went to the open place along with his friends Ghouse, Sai and Raghavender on Saturday afternoon to celebrate his birthday. Subsequently, Raghavender called his friend Tilak Goud to the spot and they all started consuming liquor. Later, their acquaintances Manik, Mittu and Raghava also reached the place and started consuming liquor separately. “Initially, an argument broke out between Tilak and Manik over a petty issue. Manik informed about the same to his brother Goutham. At about 9.30 pm, Goutham along with Manoj and some others reached the spot and attacked Tilak and his friends with sticks and stones. Narasimha Reddy sustained injuries on his head and chest when he tried to intervene,” the inspector said. Ghouse, Tilak and his friend Bhanu who came to the spot along with his father Srinivasa Goud also sustained injuries in the attack. “The injuries were minor and we have registered a case under sections 302, 307, 147 of the IPC,” the inspector said. Some of the accused have reportedly been taken into custody.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/bday-bash-goes-wrong-as-man-dies-in-drunken-brawl/articleshow/88654850.cms||---

Addressing a gathering of Kshatriya Seva Samiti on the occasion of Alluri Sitaramaraju’s 125th birthday, the minister stated that the sacrifice and heroics of the Telugu freedom fighter deserved greater recognition at the national level. “Perhaps due to discrimination against south India or Telugu states, he was never hailed as a national hero,” the minister added.The minister praised the Kshatriya community, saying Telangana has a very good rapport with them and they own large parcels of land around Hyderabad. The minister went on to say that “in the past, by selling 10 acres of land in Andhra, people could get 100 acres in Telangana, but now by selling 100 acres of land, only an acre around Hyderabad can be purchased.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/alluri-yet-to-get-his-due-at-natl-level-goud/articleshow/88654851.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Road closure and free water bones of contention for Secunderabad Cantonment residents||SECUNDERABAD: While the civilian roads’ closure issue continues to rile residents and 3.5 lakh commuters in Secunderabad Cantonment, extending 20 kilo litre free water scheme to Cantonment residents on the lines of Greater Hyderabad residents has remained unresolved. Though board meetings were conducted six times in a span of one year, no solution was arrived at on both the issues . Apart from this, residents were upset with the SCB for collecting road tax to lay new water lines and property tax, besides levying garbage charges from them. However, property owners were happy that SCB excluded certain areas like cellar/basement, watchman rooms, parking, staircases, balconies, lift rooms and generator rooms and other structures after the board announced relaxation under floor space index provisions. The SCB took another major decision by allotting its land to build a fire station, exclusively for the Cantonment. The abnormal water tariff continued to be a bone of contention for residents who say the rates were way too high when compared to the charges collected in GHMC limits. With regard to strengthening of stormwater drains, the SCB built retaining walls and culverts soon after some areas experienced inundation during the floods. One thing which kept the SCB officials on their toes the entire year was the pandemic and vaccination drives. An official said the fact that the Cantonment had registered a low death rate due to Covid-19 was because of measures taken by the board to control the spread of the virus. The Swachh Survekshan-2021 Award was a high point for the SCB, which was selected under the ‘self-sustaining Cantonment’ category. The SCB health and sanitation wing got the award for its performance in keeping the Cantonment clean and free of garbage.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/road-closure-and-free-water-bones-of-contention-for-cantonment-residents/articleshow/88654857.cms||Sunil Mungara

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Old City awaits solution to traffic woes||HYDERABAD: Narrow roads and traffic congestion continue to plague commuters across the Old City area as many road development works remain pending due to the paucity of funds and other legal disputes. Traffic snarls across the old city are not anything new for its residents as chronic congestion has been on the rise as the city expands. “The urban growth has been mostly focused towards the west and north side of Hyderabad and we have been neglected in the worst possible way,” Mohammed Rizvi, a resident of Himmatpura, told TOI. Regular traffic jams are most common on the Chandrayangutta road, where different road development works are still progressing. Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) officials are yet to complete property acquisition for the road widening works on Himmatpura to Fateh Darwaza via Dhoodh Bowli. Inordinate delays in completing projects have made the traffic congestion worse during recent times. A case in point would be the Chandrayangutta flyover extension works which have been progressing at a snail's pace. The flyover extension along with road-widening was approved by the standing committee way back in 2018 and since then delays arose due to other works, such as the construction of box-drain pipes, sewage pipelines and underground electrical cables, being taken up simultaneously. Since then, till now, traffic extends from Chandrayangutta main junction to Hafiz Baba Nagar, Falaknuma road and Kandikal gate road. “The traffic during peak hours stretches more than two kilometres in this area and we mostly find no traffic police present there or only one traffic home guard to streamline the entire stretch,” Sheikh Ajmal Basha, a jewellery shop owner, said. GHMC officials took up 20 road development works in the last two years across Chandrayangutta, Charminar and Yakutpura constituencies to tackle the existing bottlenecks. “In Yakutpura constituency , we have acquired over 600 properties to complete three major road widening projects. Around 370 properties were for road widening works from Himmatpura to Fateh Darwaza via Dhoodh Bowli. The old city will see a significant difference in the traffic scenario this year,” a senior GHMC official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/old-city-awaits-solution-to-traffic-woes/articleshow/88654865.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

Apart from private hospitals and other private healthcare facilities, a total of 159 government vaccination centres have been designated for the vaccination of the 15-18 years age group. The estimated number of beneficiaries is around 10 lakh. Most of the government vaccination centres (61) have been set up in schools, mostly those that are run by Delhi government, apart from those run by municipal bodies. Centres have also been set up at three colleges, including Shyam Lal College and Vivekananda College in east Delhi. Designated centres would also function from 20 hospitals including AIIMS, Safdarjung, Hindu Rao, Maulana Azad Medical College, Lady Hardinge, Ram Manohar Lohia and Swami Dayanand Hospital. To ensure that all eligible teens are vaccinated as soon as possible, the Delhi government’s Directorate of Education issued a circular directing heads of schools to play an important role in the exercise, apart from guidelines for schools that have been designated as centres. Each school has been asked to identify a nodal in-charge to coordinate the activity, apart from directing that class teachers of relevant classes and sections must ensure that parents are informed to take their children to nearest vaccination sites. The circular informs the schools that have been identified as centres for vaccination of teens that parents may accompany the children to the school, which should provide facilities like a separate room, staff for queue management and a verifier. While prior registration should ideally be done on the CoWIN portal, all eligible beneficiaries can also walk-in for registration to any nearby designated vaccination centre with their ID proof, and get vaccinated. There are also plans to set up temporary camps at schools for vaccination of its students of this age group, for which a mobile vaccination team can be deployed by district authorities, the circular states. While the vans would be deployed for sufficient days, depending on the number of students to be vaccinated, the circular says that the beneficiaries can be informed and mobilised to school on designated days.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/schools-gear-up-to-welcome-teens-this-time-for-vax/articleshow/88653888.cms||Sidharatha Roy

Two years ago, Telangana postal circle had proposed to open a passport seva kendra at the General Post Office (GPO), Hyderabad for the benefit of old city residents, who apply for passports. Officials of the postal department also urged Hyderabad Lok Sabha MP for his help in opening this seva kendra.In 2019, the first passport seva kendra started its functioning at Mahabubnagar and subsequently, more centres opened at Warangal, Wanaparthy, Vikarabad, Siddipet, Nalgonda, Medchal, Medak, Mancherial, Mahabubabad, Khammam, Kamareddy, Bhongir and Adilabad head post offices.These units were opened jointly by the regional passport office, Telangana and Telangana postal circle, at the earmarked post offices.“As Hyderabad GPO comes under Hyderabad Lok Sabha constituency, we have asked Asaddudin Owaisi, to help open a seva kendra here. In fact, an exclusive chamber was also identified inside the post office, too,” chief postmaster, Hyderabad GPO, A Subramanyam told TOI.“Moreover, Hyderabad GPO is a well-known post office in the twin cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad.

The home has a general physician, nurses and a clinical psychologist to take care of the homeless. People of all communities are welcome in the shelter home, said the mosque panel.This is the first time in Hyderabad that a religious place has opened its doors to shelter the homeless with all medical facilities. About 70% of the beds are reserved for the elderly while 30% are kept for the young destitute.“With biting cold sweeping across the state, rendering many abandoned and homeless people in the lurch, we have opened a home and shelter for the aged and the destitute at a mosque in Rajendranagar. The home is supervised round the clock by a doctor, nurses and bedside staff,” said Helping Hand Foundation managing trustee Mujtaba Hasan Askari, who has been convincing mosque committees across the city to take up social and medical service to the poor.There is also a facility for physiotherapy. A dietician will ensure that the homeless get the nutritious food. A clinical psychologist will tackle mental health issues of the elderly inmates. “Many senior citizens are victims of loneliness and deprivation, and the role of the clinical psychologist will be to counsel and help them fight the mental stress,” he said.The mosque facility has high standards of hygiene and sanitation. It is one of the few old age care centres outside the government to offer shelter, food and medical care free of cost to senior citizens, homeless and the destitute regardless of their caste or faith. An in-house kitchen under the supervision of a clinical nutritionist will provide healthy and hygienic food for the residents, Askari added. The shelter was set up after a survey by the HHF which revealed that many senior citizens, who are suffering with chronic diseases particularly stroke induced paralysis, do not have the means to sustain medical costs. “A lot of senior citizens are living alone without proper care. Unfortunately, there aren’t many old age care facilities free of cost for such citizens,” Askari said, explaining the reason for the shelter.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/with-cold-sweeping-across-state-city-mosque-opens-its-doors-to-homeless/articleshow/88654868.cms||Syed Akbar

---||Kolkata||Covid-19: Bengal curtails Delhi flights, closes schools||KOLKATA: The Bengal government on Sunday brought back a number of restrictions it had relaxed following the ebbing of the pandemic’s second wave, in the wake of Covid numbers steadily shooting up over the last few days, on a day the state recorded 6,153 and Kolkata 3,194 cases, the highest single-day hike since last May. According to the restrictions order issued by chief secretary H K Dwiwedi, all academic institutions — schools, colleges and universities — will remain closed till January 15. Swimming pools, salons, spas and wellness centres will also remain shut. The night restriction (between 11pm and 5am) has been brought forward by an hour: from Monday, it will start from 10pm. And while all modes of local transport will be permitted till 10pm, the movement of local trains has been curtailed: from Monday, the last local train will start from its point of origin at 7pm, with 50% seating capacity. In Kolkata, the Metro will ply at its usual timing, but at 50% capacity. In accordance with the new norms, the movement of people and vehicles and public gatherings between 10pm and 5am will be strictly prohibited, apart from essential services. State agencies have been asked to strictly enforce public compliance with masking and distancing rules to contain the spread of the disease. Offices — both government and private — have been asked to go back to the ‘50% employees at a time’ work arrangement, while encouraging work from home.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/stricter-curbs-back-in-bengal-as-state-sees-steepest-rise-in-cases-since-may/articleshow/88654873.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Kolkata||In Kolkata, Kafeel seeks plot for charitable hospital||Kolkata: Kafeel Khan, the paediatrician dismissed after the 2017 Gorakhpur oxygen shortage that took the lives of 80 children, is keen to meet chief minister Mamata Banerjee to explore the possibility of setting up a charitable hospital in Bengal. On a visit to the city, Khan said he was inspired by the CM’s “fight against fascism”. Khan had first come to the city in 2018 for a film festival where he narrated his story after the screening of a documentary. “People knew that my wife was a dentist, how my brother was shot and even my daughter’s name... My one-day trip extended to a week,” he said. Khan recalled that in five years of Yogi Adityanath’s BJP regime, he had been behind bars four times for a total of 500 days. Asked about the most painful incident of his life, he said he wouldn’t underline his “500 days in prison, job termination, family’s pain, financial condition, long legal battle and the feeling of untouchability” in Gorakhpur. “I was sent to prison when my daughter was 11 months old and was released when she was about to be 2. The day after I came out of prison, she screamed seeing someone sleeping in the bedroom. My face was new to her,” Khan said. History repeated itself in the case of his son, who was 8 months old when Khan was charged under the National Security Act. “He was one-and-a-half years old when I was released. It took months to make my son understand that I, and not my elder brother, was his father. As a paediatrician, I saved kids but my own children became alien to me,” he said. Khan is happy with the way CM Mamata Banerjee fought the assembly elections. “Bengal was the last bastion BJP wanted to destroy. It was a commendable victory for Banerjee that gives us hope as UP goes to polls,” he said. The Bengal CM, he said, reinforced his belief that one should not bend if one is right. Asked if he would join politics, Khan said his priority was his ‘Health for All’ campaign. “Our health system has not collapsed because of Covid-19. The pandemic has only exposed how the health system has collapsed.” “I would love to meet Mamata Banerjee,” he continued. “I have been terminated from my job and am searching for a plot of land where I can set up my Mission Smile hospital. I’ve spoken to the Rajasthan government and will be talking to the Bihar government. I would like to req-uest Mamata Banerjee to give me a plot of land where a charitable hospital can be set up.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/in-kolkata-kafeel-seeks-plot-for-charitable-hosp/articleshow/88654874.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Kolkata||Tigress to be freed today, hunt on for tiger||Kolkata: Sunderbans Tiger Reserve on Saturday evening undertook two big operations as one team was deployed to capture a tigress that had entered Kumirmari village and another guarded Glasskhali, more than 15km away, where a tiger had been hiding since December 31.While the Kumirmari big cat was successfully darted within 2 hours — it was first seen at the house of one Shyamapada Mondal around 8pm — and rescued by staff, the tiger at Glasskhali on Sunday morning returned to its earlier location at Chargheri, where it had been spotted on Friday.“The Kumirmari incident happened very close to the Bagna range office. The staff was preparing to capture the other big cat that had entered Glasskhali, but we wasted no time and immediately shifted a team to Kumirmari. The tigress was tranquillized by beat officer Uttam Biswas with two darts around 10pm and later put inside a cage,” said a senior forest department official. Foresters suspect it had probably come from the forest of Jhila.“The rescued tigress looks fit. It’s aged around four to five years. It has regained consciousness and drunk water. Once it completely revives, our vets will do a check-up. We will release it on Monday,” said STR deputy field director Justine Jones. Meanwhile, the department is surrounding Chargheri with two layers of nylon nets. STR field director Tapas Das said they were exploring both options of capturing the animal or driving it back to the forest.“The place where the tiger is hiding now is very dense. We are also in the process of shifting the trap cages to Chargheri and setting up two ‘machans’ there,” said Jones. He said an excavator machine was likely to be brought to the site on Monday to clear some of the vegetation, so that tranquillizing teams could get a clear view of the big cat. The tiger had injured a forest guard on Saturday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/tigress-to-be-freed-today-hunt-on-for-tiger/articleshow/88654875.cms||Krishnendu Mukherjee

It could slide further, said the Met office. With the northwesterly wind gaining strength, the mercury may drop below 13 degrees on Monday or Tuesday, according to the Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC).But the slide could be halted on January 6 when a western disturbance is likely to emerge in north India. Its impact, however, may not be felt before January 7 or 8.Last week, a western disturbance reached Gangetic Bengal through central India from Jammu and Kashmir. It had triggered clouds and rain in Bihar, north Bengal and western parts of Gangetic Bengal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/chill-to-stay-in-kolkata-for-the-next-48-hrs/articleshow/88654877.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Bengal: Flights from Delhi, Mumbai now only on Mondays and Fridays||KOLKATA: Flights from Delhi and Mumbai will be allowed into Kolkata, Andal and Bagdogra only on Mondays and Fridays.  The rule will come into effect from January 5 as part of curbs announced by the state government on Sunday to shield the state against rising Covid infection. This will mean cancellation of nearly 195 flights a week and rescheduling of travel plans of several thousand passengers who have booked in advance. But, as the restrictions kick in from Wednesday, the airlines will maintain pre-scheduled arrivals and departures from all cities till Tuesday. Last year, the state had restricted flights from Delhi and Mumbai along with four other cities to three days a week. While restriction on flights from Delhi was lifted in December 2020, curb on Mumbai flights was removed in November 2021 when Covid cases dipped after the second wave. “Flights from Delhi and Mumbai will be allowed to operate to Kolkata only two days a week, Monday and Friday,” state chief secretary HK Dwivedi announced at the state secretariat on Sunday while announcing the re-imposition of restrictions across various sectors in the wake of the warnings from health experts about the impending third wave and evidence of spiraling cases in the past seven days. The decision left people booked to travel to Delhi and Mumbai as well as those travelling abroad via these cities searching for answers. “My husband and I are booked to travel to Delhi on January 6, Thursday, and return on January 9, Sunday. What do we do now?” wondered Rajani Jaggi. The city currently has 14-odd arrivals from Mumbai and around 22-odd arrivals from Delhi daily. “Although we are yet to receive final instruction from the headquarters, we may run some outgoing flights to these centres on the five days,” an airline official said.Air India is contemplating deploying wide body aircraft between Delhi-Kolkata and Mumbai-Kolkata on the two days allowed, said an official. While airline officials rushed to drawing board to check if they could continue to operate outgoing flights to these cities and re-book flyers on incoming flights via other cities as they had done earlier, travel agents said they were flooded with calls from anxious clients. Not just international travellers, even domestic business travel could take a major blow. “Nearly 60% of business travel from Kolkata happens to these two cities. Corporate executives and businessmen won’t risk travelling and then get stranded for four days,” said Travel Agents' Federation of India chairman (east) Anil Punjabi. Others, though, are optimistic airlines will find a way out like they had last year when they scheduled flights from these cities with single stops at cities like Raipur, Bhubaneswar, Lucknow, Nagpur, Hyderabad or Visakhapatnam. “For flyers transiting Mumbai and Delhi, airlines should operate direct flights to these cities,” said Travel Agents’ Association of India chairman (east) Manav Soni.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/flights-from-delhi-mumbai-now-only-on-mondays-and-fridays/articleshow/88654878.cms||Subhro Niyogi

All government offices, including public undertakings, will be functioning with 50% strength at a time. The government is also encouraging work from home module. Officials from the state secretariat said the government is also planning to go for skeletal service and will rotate staff on alternate days. However, senior officers and health workers are expected to attend on all days.Calcutta High Court has also asked to reduce manpower and keep attendance to 66% at a time. Non-essential departments are to be suspended.IT and IT enabled services will also function with 50% of employees at a time. “The 50% attendance rule as advised by the government has to be followed and we have to make sure that all employees get their double vaccination. It would not be much of a problem for IT companies as already work from home module is in place. But firms which are engaged in IT enabled services will have to reorganize themselves as per the fresh guidelines,” said Sector V Stakeholders Association vice president Kalyan Kar. The management, owners and supervisors of all offices, establishments and workplaces will be responsible for provisioning of Covid safety measures, including regular sanitization at the work places, vaccination of employees and to comply with the directives.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/wfh-staff-rotation-back-at-private-govt-offices/articleshow/88654879.cms||Suman Chakraborti
---||Kolkata||Exam worries loom as schools scurry to shift to online mode||Kolkata: The new Covid restrictions announced on Monday, which included shutting down of schools and colleges, have made city schools shift their offline exams and classes back to the online mode. Students of Class XI across several city schools had offline unit tests scheduled from Monday. Lakshmipat Singhania Academy, for instance, has unit tests for classes IX and XI from January 5 which will now be shifted to the online mode. State affiliated Jodhpur Park Boys’ School has two more exams left which will be shifted to online mode from Monday. St Xavier’s Collegiate School will conduct unit tests for classes IX and XI from January 10 in online mode.Most of the city’s private schools have just finished the first phase of board exams. Many have deferred their exams after the new government directive on Sunday.A few students, who have missed offline Semester 1 exams due to health issues, were allowed to sit for the offline reassessment starting from January 10. Three students from La Martiniere for Boys and one each from Calcutta Boys’ and St Xavier’s School have missed Semester 1 exams due to health issues. The new directive has put a question mark on whether schools will be able to conduct the exams on campus. Only one student of Class XII had missed the semester one exams. The ICSE council has allowed him to take a reassessment test but we are still waiting for the date of examination,” said M Thamacin Arulappan, principal, St Xavier’s Collegiate School.St Xavier’s Collegiate School had a plan to call classes IX and XI for physical classes from the middle of January. “Students have unit tests from January 10 which will be conducted online. According to the new directive, classes for IX to XII will now be shifted from offline to online mode,” said Arulappan. Director of Lakshmipat Sighania Academy, Meena Kak, said, “Classes IX and XI have unit tests from January 5 which will be conducted online.” DPS Ruby Park has decided to shift offline exams which are going to start from Monday to the online mode.Jodhpur Park Boys’ had to reschedule the test exam dates due to civic polls. The exam started from December 27 and will be completed on January 4. The school authority has decided to shift the last two exams to online mode. “Students will get the questions on their smartphones and after completion of the paper, they need to upload answer scripts. Hard copies will be submitted by the parents later,” said Amit Sen Majumder, headmaster.Rammohan Mission School was planning a new schedule for offline classes which has now been cancelled. Schools like South Point, La Martiniere, St Xavier’s Collegiate School have decided to shift all offline classes to online mode.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/exam-worries-loom-as-schools-scurry-to-shift-to-online-mode/articleshow/88654880.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Hosps, schools, 37 KMC clinics gear up as 15-18 vaccination rolls out today||Kolkata: The vaccination rollout for 15-18-year-olds will commence on Monday despite schools being shut.In Kolkata, all medical colleges and hospitals, 37 KMC health clinics will give Covaxin and 16 schools will be part of this vaccination drive, said Ajay Chakraborty, director of health services. Across the state, the vaccination drive will commence in one school each across the 479 blocks and civic bodies. The drive will take place across 338 hospitals.“We have 60 lakh Covaxin doses to begin the drive for this age group,” said Ashim Das Malakar, state family welfare officer. There are around 48 lakh eligible recipients in this age group. “We are prepared to offer the jab to about 1,000 recipients a day. We have close to 10,000 Covaxin doses in our stock to start with. We will replenish our stock as and when required,” Said Rupali Basu, managing director & CEO, Woodlands. The hospital will be conducting the drive from its dedicated vaccination camp which is close to the hospital and keep it open from 9am to 7pm. “Currently, we have 400 doses of the vaccine and have indented for about 2,500 vials. We will see how the response goes before deciding if we would need to requisition for more doses,” said Sudipta Mitra, CEO of Peerless HospitalHospitals like Belle Vue, which did have Covaxin stock, is yet to get its order delivered. It has already tied up with three prominent schools but said it would be able to activate drive only after vials arrived. “We placed order for 5,600 doses of Covaxin. Since our supply has not arrived yet we will not be able to roll out our drive by Monday, but it should take off by January 7,” said Belle Vue CEO Pradip Tondon.Hospitals like AMRI had sent its old Covaxin stock for re-labelling and has placed fresh order for 10,000 doses. In absence of Covaxin stock the hospital chain has not activated itself for registration on Co-Win. “We had sent vials containing 3,600 doses for re-labelling. Even as the government has announced the shelf life of Covaxin for a year we did not want to use the old stocks we had without re-labelling as recipients might raise an issue. Hence we will not be able to begin our drive on Monday,” said a source at AMRI Group of hospitals.Vaccination camp will start at South Point School from January 4 on junior school premises. Around 3,000 students have been identified. “Slots need to be booked in advance and the amount needs to be prepaid,” said Krishna Damani, trustee. The Heritage School has asked for consent letter from parents. “We have around 1,100 eligible students and more than 200 parents have given consent,” said Seema Sapru, principal. KMC will organize a camp at St Xavier’s Collegiate School ground from January 4. Daily, 250 students will get the jabs. “We called 6-7 from the old boy’s association who will help them to do registration,” said M Thamacin Arulappan, principal.Sakhawat Memorial has asked for consent letter from parents and students have been told to come with their parents. Two data entry operators will be present for registration and one doctor will also be present, headmistress Papia Nag Singha Mahapatra said. Bagbazar Multipurpose Govt Sponsored School has divided slots for students and Class-XII students have been called on first day. Taki House has asked students to get ready for registration.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Metro operations @ 50% capacity, local trains till 7pm||KOLKATA: Commuters will once again face curbs on transport services after six months, after state government curtailed Metro and local train occupancy by 50%, as part of fresh measures to combat the third wave. Metro is reducing hours by 30 minutes from Monday and will run 270 services instead of 276. The last train from Dakshineswar now leaves at 8.48pm and from Kavi Subhas and Dum Dum at 9pm instead of 9.30pm.  To check footfalls, Metro Railway will stop issuing tokens too. Ever since these single-journey tickets were reintroduced from November 26, Metro’s ridership along the North-South corridor jumped from less than 3 lakh to 4.5 lakh. “Metro Railway will temporarily suspend issuance of tokens to operate with 50% capacity,” a spokesperson said. Only smartcards will be issued. On November 28, the Kavi Subhas-Dakshineswar corridor registered 3,57,764 daily ridership. On Christmas Eve it attained the 4.5-lakh milestone. Last Monday, the utility crossed 4-lakh mark along the North-South line. Tokens, costing Rs 5 for the shortest 2km journey, encouraged more people to take the Metro. “The multiple-travel smartcards, costing Rs 120 at the minimum may dissuade irregular commuters and would reduce ridership,” an official said. Restrictions have also been clamped on suburban trains. The last local will now leave its point of origin at 7pm, with 50% seating capacity. Long-distance trains will operate as usual. Intra-city and intercity bus services will continue with the 10pm deadline. “Since both government and private offices will function with 50% staff, we are asking bus operators to limit capacity,” a transport official said. “To avoid overcrowding, operators may run as many buses as possible. The state transport undertakings will run its full fleet. But no buses after 9pm from points of origin,” a WBTC officer said. Autos can’t run beyond 10pm, except those facilitating passengers of long-distance trains. Cab operators will have to carry relevant documents for ferrying passengers to and from airport, station or emergency requirements, an official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/metro-ops-50-capacity-local-trains-till-7pm/articleshow/88654882.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Carry valid documents during 10pm-5am night curbs||KOLKATA: Night restrictions will be back from 10pm to 5am and all persons travelling at night should either carry valid IDs, hospital-issued documents, travel documents, or earlier issued e-passes, police said. West Bengal chief secretary HK Dwivedi on Sunday announced that movement of people, vehicles and public gatherings of any kind will be prohibited between 10pm and 5am. Only essential and emergency services will be permitted. Officers clarified that those with valid ID cards — ones they have been using before restrictions were eased — need not worry. “The same documents must be kept ready to show at nakas,” said an ACP. Lalbazar has asked all its men on duty to allow everyone with valid documents and ID cards, even if they do not carry e-passes. Documents issued by hospitals and travel tickets too will be considered. The drink-driving nakas at night will now be even more strict while checking vehicles post 10 pm. “We have had enough experience last year and it will be nothing new,” said a joint commissioner, stating that breathalyzer tests will continue. The police said that they will also carry out massive crackdown on those not wearing masks. “While vehicle checks will be stringent at night, we have asked all units to intensify mask vigil during the day,” said a senior officer. According to cops the focus will be on the markets. On Saturday and Sunday (till 3pm and even before the state imposed restrictions), cops had already charged 1,277 persons for not wearing masks and arrested 786 individuals for breaking Covid protocols. “If you have ventured out with your car despite not being an essential-duty person or travelled without any medical emergency, be prepared to receive an SMS from us asking you to explain your action,” said an officer. Those receiving such SMS will be asked to send a clarification email. “We will use our CCTV cameras to track down such vehicles that will violate restrictions. If the explanation provided is found to be unsatisfactory, we will slap charges under IPC section 188 and section 51 (b) of the Disaster Management Act,” said a senior officer at Lalbazar. Officers from police stations and traffic guards are seeking more clarity about the night drives. “According to the order, malls, markets, restaurants and pubs can operate till 10pm. The same order says night restrictions too will start at 10pm. Earlier, there was nothing specific on whether patrons and employees of these places will be accorded time to return home,” claimed a cop on EM Bypass.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/carry-valid-docus-during-10pm-5am-night-curbs/articleshow/88654883.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||Kolkata to get list of 11 micro containment zones today||KOLKATA: Total 11 micro-containment zones will be declared in the city on Monday, said chief secretary HS Dwivedi on Sunday. KMC sources said that a probable list has been prepared and sent to mayor Firhad Hakim who will take the final decision. A formal announcement is expected later after a meeting in this regard by senior KMC officials in Kolkata. Senior police officers, who are working in coordination with KMC, indicated that a majority of the containment zones are located in south and central Kolkata. A few clusters from Sealdah, Taltala and the southeast, from where multiple cases have been reported, will be included in the list of containment zones. “This time, government colonies, especially those where the residents have constant interaction with the public, have been worst hit,” said a source. In contrast, the areas, which have reported a higher number of Covid cases in south Kolkata, are mainly high-rises and standalone buildings where gatherings during the festive season led to a rise in Covid cases. However, their overall numbers are less. “We are planning to bring them under containment due to their proximity with densely populated areas,” said a KMC health department officer. Cops indicated that the markets located near these containment zones will also be under watch. The biggest worry for cops and KMC is the slums, especially since several are located close to the infected zones. The chief secretary spoke of setting up three safe homes where those with symptoms in such slums can isolate themselves.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/city-to-get-list-of-11-micro-containment-zones-today/articleshow/88654884.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||In a week, Kolkata Police Covid count rises from 2 to 63||KOLKATA: On the day of Christmas, Kolkata Police had reported two active cases. Three days ago, nine cops had tested positive on a single day, taking the active cases to 11. On Sunday evening, the number of active cases stood at 63 with 18 fresh cases being reported on Saturday and 13 on Sunday.  Three of them are IPS officers, including an additional CP and two joint CPs. One of the joint CPs has been diagnosed with Covid for the third time. Thirteen of these cops are admitted at different hospitals in the city, the highest since July last year. “Total 50 Kolkata Police personnel have tested positive for Covid-19,” said an officer from the KP welfare cell that has been monitoring the health of cops since the beginning of Covid. Most of these cops have been vaccinated with both the doses. According to sources, the fresh cases were mostly found among the cops who were out on duty between Christmas and New Year.  “A sergeant from Jorabagan traffic guard was at the forefront of our drive against drink-driving. He and his family members have been infected with the virus. Several cops, who were on duty to maintain law and order, are keeping themselves isolated from their families,” said an officer.  Lalbazar asked all OCs and ACPs to fall back on the old SOPs.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/in-a-week-kol-pol-cov-count-rises-from-2-to-63/articleshow/88654885.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Harshad Panchal, a resident of Waghodia Road, told the police that he was duped of Rs 3.92 lakh by Sandip Patel who stays in Subhanpura area. Panchal said that he had worked with Patel in a private company many years ago. The accused contacted Panchal on Facebook in 2020 and told him that he has started a business. Patel then talked with Panchal on phone and offered the latter partnership in the business. The accused even did an online video call meet with Panchal along with one Satyen Trivedi. Some days later, Patel called up Panchal and took his credit card and OTP number for a transaction. Panchal told the police that Rs 3.64 lakh went out of his bank account and Patel told him that the money has been transferred to a Hong Kong-based company. The accused then made a fake email id in Panchal’s name and used the money to take Gold Club membership. Patel also took Rs 27,500 from Panchal to give distribution documents for the business. The complainant soon realised that he was duped by Patel following which he approached the police.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/engineer-files-cheating-plaint-against-former-colleague/articleshow/88653510.cms||---
---||Delhi||Power demand higher in Delhi than 2020 on 227 days of last year||NEW DELHI: While the Covid-19 outbreak and the lockdown in 2020 had resulted in Delhi’s power demand dipping significantly after a constant rise for many years, last year saw the demand rising again and almost come close to the all-time high. The city’s highest peak power demand in 2021 was 7,323 MW, just a shade lower than the all-time high of 7,409 MW recorded in 2019. However, what is perhaps a better parameter of gauging the rise in demand, on 227 days in 2021, or 61% times, the peak power demand was higher than the corresponding days in 2020. According to officials, 2021 not only saw the intense second Covid-19 wave, but also excessive weather conditions. As the year came to a close, the capital experienced extreme cold waves. The city witnessed an intense monsoon that continued well into late October recording 1,512.4mm of rainfall till December 29, the second highest ever. The extreme weather events, along with Covid related restrictions and their eventual easing had an impact on the power demand, sources said. A month-wise analysis showed that peak power demand in December 2021 was higher on 58% or 18 corresponding days vis-a-vis December 2020. For November 2021, it was higher on 15 corresponding days compared with November 2020. Similarly, October saw higher demand on 18 corresponding days compared with the previous year, while September saw only six such days. But August and July recorded higher demand on 21 days each, while June saw higher demand on 23 or 77% of the days, May on 20 days, March on 24 days, and January on 23 days. On the other hand, while February saw higher demand on 10 days, April saw higher demand almost throughout the month, ie 28 days (93%). The highest peak power demand recorded in December 2021 was 4,685 MW, the last day of the year. This was not only the highest of December last year, but also surpassed that of 2020 (4,671 MW) recorded on December 30. On December 16, 2021, the peak power demand crossed 4,000 MW for the first-time this winter season and, since then, it has crossed the 4,000 MW-mark on 16 occasions. “Ensuring reliable supply in any season is as much the function of proper power arrangements as also accurate demand forecast and robust distribution network. The backbone of BSES’ power supply arrangements during the winter months includes long-term agreements from power plants, including hydro and Delhi-based gas fuelled generating stations,” said a BSES spokesperson.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/power-demand-higher-than-2020-on-227-days-of-last-yr/articleshow/88653897.cms||Sidharatha Roy

Surat district had reported 14 new cases. However, in what comes as good news for the authorities, no new case of Omicron variant was reported during the last 24 hours. Notable here is that Sunday’s figures touch May 2021 levels when the city scored over double century in fresh cases at record 228 cases in one day. Among the 209 new cases, two are young females having international travel history. According to Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC), a 26-year-old girl who lives in Limbayat and studying in Canada tested positive. In another case, a 17-year-old girl from Katargam area falling under the North zone tested positive after returning from Dubai where she had gone on vacation.

---||Kolkata||Fresh Covid cases: 21-fold spike in Kolkata in 6 days, 14-fold surge in West Bengal||KOLKATA: Bengal and Kolkata have witnessed the sharpest surge in Covid cases since last week with the number of patients jumping 14 times in the state and an overwhelming 21 times in the city in six days between December 27 and January 2. This is much higher than the spikes that the city and the state had seen during the peaks of the first and second waves when the number of cases had risen far more gradually. This probably points at the fact that the virus, in its present form, is far more transmissible than what it had been previously, said a section of experts. From a mere 148 cases in Kolkata on December 27, the number of Covid positive cases leapt to 3,194 on January 2, a 21-fold increase that has never been recorded in such a short span since the beginning of the pandemic. The number of cases in Bengal, on the other hand, soared to 6,153 on January 2 from just 439 on December 27 — a 14-fold rise. The state’s positivity rate, too, soared from a mere 1.7% on December 25 to 12% on January 1. While the number of daily cases had been far higher in the city and the state during the peak of the second wave in May, the spike had been slower. For instance, Kolkata had recorded 3,885 new cases on May 1, which crawled up to 3,973 five days later and eventually touched 3,951 on May 15 when the second wave was at its peak. Bengal, which had recorded 17,512 cases on May 1, moved up to 18,102 on May 5, 19,445 on May 10 and peaked at 19,511 on May 17. The case spike had been even slower during the peak of the first wave in October, 2020. From 783 cases on October 10, Kolkata crept to 784 on October 15 and reached 895 on October 24. Bengal, too, saw an increase of less than a thousand cases between October 10 and October 24 in 2020. While the state had clocked 3,591 cases on October 10, it reached 4,148 cases on October 24. The state is now witnessing the biggest wave of the pandemic in terms of transmissibility that has pushed up the numbers overnight, said Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education & Research (IPGMER) professor, Diptendra Sarkar. “Even though weak, the current strain is easily the most infectious and it has been proved by the rapid surge that we saw in the city and the state over the last five-six days. This will continue till at least a fortnight when we could reach the peak of this wave,” said Sarkar. Each subsequent wave of the pandemic will see the number of the affected rise in geometric progression, said Belle Vue Clinic internal medicine consultant Rahul Jain. “The virus may have got weaker but Omicron is far more transmissible and is driving this wave. Over the next few weeks, a substantially large section of the population will get infected. Even if the number of hospitalizations remains low, the huge number of patients, who would require treatment, can make the health system collapse,” said Jain.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/fresh-covid-cases-21-fold-spike-in-kol-in-6-days-14-fold-surge-in-state/articleshow/88654886.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Kolkata||Kolkata malls will return to pre-Puja closure timings||KOLKATA: City mall operators welcomed the state government restrictions that will allow the facilities to operate till 10pm and were thankful a shutdown was not declared like it was done during the first and second waves. At the same time, they assured the government that malls would continue to strictly adhere to Covid measures and prevent the facilities from turning into hot spots. The mall managers at South City, Acropolis, Quest, Mani Square and the two City Centres reworked on the mall timings following announcement of the new restrictions. With malls required to shut at 10pm, most of them have told retailers to down shutters by 9pm while restaurants will take the last order at 9.15 pm-9.30pm. Acropolis plans to open an hour early at 10am instead of 11am to make up for lost business in the late evening. “Covid has taught us to be flexible and think on our feet,” said mall GM K Vijayan. All malls will return to pre-Puja closure timings from Monday. “Footfall has declined already. Usually it is a lean period till mid-January,” said Quest mall vice-president Sanjeev Mehra. South City, the city’s most popular mall that attracted upto nearly 65-70% of the capacity footfall during the peak periods ahead of Durga Puja and during Christmas, said it will ensure the visitor count does not breach the 50% mark. “We are allowing only fully vaccinated adults into the mall. We will continue to enforce mask and distancing protocol. There will be no let up on our part,” said mall VP Manmohan Singh.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/city-malls-will-return-to-pre-puja-closure-timings/articleshow/88654887.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Kolkata||Couples, event planners start cutting guest lists as state limits wedding attendees to 50||Kolkata: With the state on Sunday limiting attendance at social, religious and cultural gatherings to 50, weddings — that had soared to a record 1.8 lakh in Bengal in 2021 — are likely to take an immediate hit. The directive issued by Nabanna has thrown a number of wedding planners in a state of confusion about how to execute the event under these new guidelines. Those set to get married are trying to prune the guest list and cancelling the associated functions. Yet others said they would like to defer their weddings. In 2021, Bengal had over 1.8 lakh weddings, a record high in recent years. A great number of these had been scheduled for 2020 but were pushed back due to the pandemic. IT professional Priyanka Mukherjee, whose wedding was scheduled later this month, had a guest list of over 600. “If it is a matter of safety, then I would surely comply with the recent regulations. But it will be very difficult to decide at such a late stage how to reduce the guest list to 50 invitees. However, I think that my bigger concern are the issues that will be raised by the night curfew. I will worry about how my guests would be getting home,” she said.Wedding photographer Shubhojit Das said, “The biggest problem that we face with sudden restrictions is the drastic budget cuts.” He explained that when the number of guests at social and religious gatherings are limited, then the bride or groom often requests that he reduce his staff so that they can retain more people on their guest lists. “Since the restrictions were issued today, I have already received calls from two clients making this request,” he said.A number of weddings have also been cancelled or pushed back indefinitely after the notice. A Delhi resident originally from Beliaghata, Devendra Lal Mitra has decided to cancel his wedding scheduled on February 2. He was alarmed after two of his colleagues were diagnosed with the Omicron variant. “I had been planning the wedding for about eight months and I regret not being able to finalize the date for December 2021,” he said.Meanwhile, a Chicago-based doctor had a wedding planned for his daughter at ITC Sonar Bangla on February 5. But with travel restrictions, they do not know what to do now. “I will just wait till further notifications by the government before making a decision. Until then, all my plans are indefinitely postponed,” he said said.Marriage registrar Anita Chakraborty suggested that since the pandemic, while social weddings have been delayed or rescheduled, marriage registrations have continued at a regular pace. “At this moment, since it is Poush in the Bengali calendar — which is considered inauspicious for marriage — I am not finding many Hindu couples. But Muslim and Christian marriage registrations are continuing as normal. After this month, I expect Hindu marriage registrations to also continue like usual. We practice social distancing, and make sure the couple and witnesses are sanitized and vaccinated before entering our office,” she said. These restrictions will be in place till January 15, when further instructions will be issued by the state government.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/couples-event-planners-start-cutting-guest-lists-as-state-limits-wedding-attendees-to-50/articleshow/88654888.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Lighter restrictions bring relief to food-and-beverage sector||KOLKATA: The new set of restrictions to be introduced from Monday will impact restaurants, bars and clubs, but they could have been harsher. Hence, there is some sense of relief for bars, restaurants and clubs. According to new restrictions, bars have to operate with 50% capacity and must shut down by 10pm. The president of Hotel and Restaurant Association of Eastern India, Sudesh Poddar feels at least they would be able to do some business. "We welcome the decisions of the government as the industry would not like to do business over Covid. Even with restrictions in place, we will be doing some business that will help meet payroll and statutory payments. We will advise our members to close by 9.30pm so patrons can safely return home by 10pm,” he said. The owner of Peter Cat, Mocambo and Peter Hu!, Nitin Kothari, said 8.30pm-10.30pm is the peak dinner time for most restaurants, but considering the current situation, it is a sensible move. “The state has done what any responsible government would do. They have applied their mind and have given some time to customers,” he said. Debaditya Chaudhury, director of Chowman, Oudh 1590 & Chapter 2, feels this order brings some relief as it could have been worse if the government decided to close the dine-in option completely. “However, this is peak season for us and business will be affected as we can only operate at 50% occupancy and have to close by 10pm. At the same time, business from home delivery and online food delivery will not be affected,” he said. Pradeep Rozario, owner of KKs Fusion and Mio Amore, also felt this was the best decision considering the situation, though he added that restaurants would lose the family crowd as they generally come after 8.30pm. There are 4,000-5,000 bars and restaurants in the city and outskirts with a combined annual revenue of Rs 6,000-Rs 7,000 crore. The bar and restaurant industry in Kolkata had suffered a loss of Rs 4,000-Rs 4,500 crore since the beginning of the pandemic in April 2020. The premier city clubs are also gearing up to follow the new rules. The secretary of Calcutta Rowing Club, Chandan Roychowdhury, said, “We will not allow guests for the next two weeks from Monday.” The club will close all swimming pools and rowing from Monday. Tolly Club CEO Anil Mukherjee said, “We will scale down operations and discuss the issue in the committee.” The manager, operations, of Princeton Club, Sanjay Karmakar, said it is closing the gym and spa, and the new last-order time will be 9.15pm.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/lighter-restrictions-bring-relief-to-food-and-beverage-sector/articleshow/88654889.cms||Udit Prasanna Mukherji

Eco Park in New Town, which registered huge footfall on Christmas and January 1, will remain closed till January 15. It will be the same for Nicco Park. Victoria Memorial Hall registered large crowds during the festive weekVictoria Memorial Hall has decided to shut down the museum, as well as its lawns, till further notice. Indian Museum, Science City and Birla Industrial & Technological Museum will also be closed till January 15. Birla Planetarium, though, is yet to take a call. Sources said they were evaluating it since they could operate with 50% capacity as auditoriums, theatres and cinema halls have been allowed to do so. “We have been operating at 50% capacity all along, even though the capacity was raised to 70% earlier,” said an official. The Alipore zoo, which also saw large crowds last week, will be closed to public till January 15 according to the government order. Speaking about forest, a senior department official said that though no order had been issued till now, they might suspend operations from Monday itself. He said that sanctuaries and national parks, though, are not considered typical tourist zones. According to the order, the Botanical Garden at Shibpur, Howrah, will also remain closed for now.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/tourist-spots-parks-zoos-to-be-closed-till-january-15/articleshow/88654890.cms||---

Less than 1% of the city’s population come to gyms and this is also a place where utmost level of sanitization is maintained. The government could have been lenient like allowing gyms to operate with fewer patrons or limited number of days in a week. The decision to completely suspend operations is going to hurt the industry badly which has already suffered a lot through the pandemic,” said Gagan Sachdeva, proprietor of Karma Fitness Studio and a senior member of Bengal Gym Owners’ Forum.Fitness enthusiasts were also upset about the decision, but said they would stick to the regulations set by the state and will work out at home and over online sessions to keep themselves fit till the time gyms reopen.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/fitness-industry-worried-over-closing-doors-again/articleshow/88654891.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Kolkata||27th Kolkata International Film Festival on schedule, but with 50% audience||KOLKATA: The physical edition of the 27th Kolkata International Film Festival (KIFF) will be held from January 7 this year. KIFF chairperson Raj Chakraborty said, “We will abide by the government notification. KIFF will be held maintaining all health protocols. There will be 50% occupancy for all screenings. That is exactly what was done in 2021 when the 26th KIFF’s physical edition was held successfully.” Regional director, INOX (East) Amitava Guha Thakurta recalled how cinemas had reopened last August with 50% seating capacity. “Later, the restrictions were relaxed to 70%. We have always been maintaining all health protocols. We believe we will overcome this situation too,” he said. Ratan Saha, chairman, exhibitors’ section, Eastern India Motion Pictures Association, said the 50% occupancy at cinemas is the best that the government could have allowed. “If the situation is stable, things will continue this way. Otherwise, I don’t know what the future holds for us. People themselves are responsible for this state. Unless they wear masks, it is impossible to fight the virus,” Saha said. Joydeep Mukherjee, who has the lease for Star, said, “The government has not specified alternate seating arrangements. All we have to ensure is that we sell only 250 out of the 500 tickets.” Navin Choukhani, Navina’s owner, is happy for cine-exhibitors. “We will follow all health protocols. However, the release of many Hindi films, like ‘RRR’, ‘Radhe Shyam’, ‘Valimal’ and ‘Prithviraj Chauhan’, have been postponed. I don’t know about the Bengali movie releases now,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/27th-kiff-on-schedule-but-with-50-audience/articleshow/88654892.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Don’t come to campus after winter break, colleges, universities tell students after govt order||KOLKATA: Many colleges and universities scheduled to resume classes in the offline mode after Christmas break scrambled to inform their students not to come to campus on Monday after the state announced all educational institutes would remain shut due to rising Covid cases. Sunday’s announcement disappointed both students and teachers. However, most of them said they had been expecting it given how fast the cases were rising. Jadavpur University, on Sunday, sent out a notice saying some staffers in Aurobindo Bhavan and Central Library had been diagnosed with Covid and hence, these buildings will be closed on Monday for sanitization. The authorities in colleges and universities had informed students that examinations would be held in the online mode. Many had earlier decided to hold offline examinations, but changed their minds after a rise in cases in the past week. Some residential colleges were scheduled to bring in more batches on campus after Christmas break, but they have now informed students that classes will be online till further instructions. “We were planning to call in more students for offline classes in the coming weeks, but the plan has now changed as the government has announced educational institutes will be shut due to rising cases of Covid. Even those students who were already coming for offline classes will now only be attending online classes. Examinations for various semesters are already underway in the online mode,” said Father Dominic Savio, principal of St Xavier’s College. Jadavpur University had summoned students of BSC UG-I and UG-III from January 3 for offline classes. “But all classes will be now held online,” said Snehamanju Basu, registrar. At Ramakrishna Mission Vidyamandira, too, classes will be held online. “This is a residential college and we have to be very careful before we call students on campus,” said vice-principal Swami Mahaprajnananda. Maulana Azad College used WhatsApp groups for online classes to inform students they will be shifting back to the virtual mode from Monday. “We were taking hybrid classes, so the infrastructure for online classes is still in place,” said principal Subhasis Dutta. All classes will be held in the online mode at Presidency University as well. Calcutta University had announced that all examinations of the university and its affiliated colleges will be held on digital platforms in the middle of last month.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/dont-come-to-campus-after-winter-break-colleges-univs-tell-students-after-govt-order/articleshow/88654893.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Kolkata||Complete closure will hit us badly, say salon owners but hope this halts rising Cov graph||Kolkata: The total closure of beauty parlours, salons and spas from Monday has elicited a mixed response. While owners would have liked a partial closure, many feel that this restriction is a step in the right direction.Soma Santra, front office supervisor of Vedic Village Sanjeeva Ayurveda Centre located inside the Vedic Village Spa Resort, said they will refuse patrons who come only for relaxation. “This move will definitely curb the rising numbers. We will be following the restrictions imposed and reopen only when instructed by the government,” Santra said.Anjali Sambtani, owner of Juice Salon that has two branches in Alipore and Rowland Row, too will do the same. “The number of clients, in any case, weren’t too high as people are apprehensive. This new restriction is like a body blow for us. The only consolation is that with this kind of a measure, we will hopefully be able to return to normalcy soon. But I wish we were allowed to operate with 50% occupancy,” she said.Beautician Sharmila Singh Flora, who runs a parlour since 1992, remembers how last year she had received requests from loyal patrons, asking her to reopen her parlour during the lockdown. “A diabetic patient needed a pedicure urgently. Elderly people needed haircuts. They wanted us to down shutters but reopen the back gate to the salon. We refused and when we reopened, we ensured protocols were followed. It is sad steps were not taken earlier to control the crowd and we are bearing the brunt again. Owners will survive but I wish the government understood the plight of the foot soldiers. A partial closure of salons would have been a better option,” she said.Those who offer beauty services at home are hoping that they will get calls now. “We have families to run and bills to pay. I am hoping that with parlours shut, my clients will call us,” said beautician Rakhi Sarkar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/complete-closure-will-hit-us-badly-say-salon-owners-but-hope-this-halts-rising-cov-graph/articleshow/88654894.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

The angioplasty was done on a 58-year-old man from Mapusa, a chain smoker who had several comorbidities such as uncontrolled diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and chronic kidney disease. He was hospitalised for congestive cardiac failure and recurrent angina with a history of heart attack, for which he had undergone angioplasty. After he suffered another cardiac failure recently, his creatinine level was elevated. The angioplasty was conducted by consultant cardiologist Dr Ajeya Mundhekar with the help of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), a cutting-edge technology that taps the medium of ultrasound to visualise an artery from inside to aid highly complex procedures, and minimise dependence on traditional contrast media.. “The procedure is of great help to patients needing angioplasty and who have kidney disease. Zero-contrast angioplasty was performed for the first time in Goa. It aids in faster decision-making and to save life by preventing the risk of kidney failure and dialysis,” Mundhekar said. The patient was turned down by several surgeons due to the high risk involved in a traditional angioplasty procedure. “We passed a wire through his arteries and for imaging, we used a camera-like device to perform IVUS of his artery. We viewed from inside how tight and how long the blockages were, (and) traced the calcium deposits,” he said. “This definitely brings a big hope in treating patients with chronic kidney disease. While the surgery can be performed on patients of all age groups, the zero-contrast angioplasty is particularly necessary for patients with impaired kidney function,” he said.

Congress leaders Ramniwas Rawat and Kamleshwar Patel addressed a press conference to condemn the “arrest of OBC Mahasabha workers”. The party said that it was not a Congress agitation and that it had only lent support to the OBC Mahasabha and its agitation. “The Mahasabha has supporters of different parties and groups, including Congress, but we were not directly involved in the agitation. However, we stand in solidarity with them and condemn the police lathi charge on protesters,” said party spokesperson JP Dhanopia.

---||Bhopal||VD: Cong trying to debase atmosphere in MP with help of OBC Mahasabha||Bhopal: BJP state president V D Sharma said on Sunday hit out at the Congress alleging that the party is trying to vitiate atmosphere in the state with the help of OBC Mahasabha.  Referring to the attempt by OBC Mahasabha to hold demonstration at CM House,Sharma said that the Congress has shown its anti-OBC face not once but on several occasions. Be it the issue of 27 percent to OBCs in jobs or reservation for OBCs in the panchayat polls, OBCs know very well that Congress has only been initerested in their "political" use rather than working for their welfare, he said. “Now, the Congress has put forward its B team to vitiate atmosphere in the state. The team is an "expert" in doing this, as it only see problems of OBCs or dalits in BJP-ruled states, what is happening in other states is never their concern. They conveniently gloss over the incidents taking place in Rajasthan or Maharashtra”, Sharma said. He said, “When a dalit Dhanprasad was burnt alive in Sagar district during Kamal Nath's rule in MP, no one from the Bhim Army came forward to express solidarity with the victim's family. Now, leaders of this team are portraying themselves as the biggest advocates of the rights of OBCs. Congress has done nothing for the OBCs and therefore it's resorting to "negative" politics to incite the people of this section. He said, “Shivraj Singh Chouhan government by withdrawing the notofication of panchayat elections has proved that it wants to carry along all sections of the society. Referring People of OBC groups know that their interests are safe only with the BJP and any attempt to vitiate peaceful atmosphere in the state won't be allowed to anyone".||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/vd-cong-trying-to-debase-atmosphere-in-mp-with-help-of-obc-mahasabha/articleshow/88654927.cms||---

Addressing a press conference at PCC headquarters on Sunday, former minister Kamleshwar Patel said that the manner in which the protestors were arrested and beaten up and their mobiles were snatched reflects the anti-OBC character of the BJP government. He said that the peaceful protest was aimed at highlighting the genuine demand of OBC Mahasabha members at the CM House, but they were chased away by the administration. He said that hundreds of workers of OBC Mahasabha were cane-charged and taken into custody, many of them are still missing. Patel said that section 144 of the IPC was imposed in the city citing Covid protocol, but only a day earlier there was"path sanchalan" of RSS workers and police & administration in place of stopping it were providing security to the participants of "path sanchalan". "The RSS cadres holding "path sanchalan" were not stopped for violating Covid protocol, but workers of OBC Mahasabha, who had come to protest over scrapping of reservation in panchayat elections, were beaten up and detained", he said. Stopping people from the OBC section from raising the issue of reservation reflects the anti-OBC face of the BJP government in the state”, he said. Patel said that the RSS believes in anti-reservation but the Congress would not allow the RSS and BJP to scrap reservation. Former minister Ramniwas Rawat, who also addressed the press conference, said that "unnecessary" changes in the panchayat election process were made by the state government with the intention to ensure that OBC reservation in panchayats is scrapped. Accusing the state BJP of making false allegations against the Congress, he said that BJP wants to defame the Congress on OBC reservation by misinforming the people but what happened with workers of OBC Mahasabha today was seen by the entire state and the country and it is clear as to which party is with the OBCs and which is against them.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/cong-slams-police-action-against-obc-protesters-in-bhopal/articleshow/88654928.cms||---

The school education department has decided to conduct the on-spot registration vaccination. DEO Bhopal, Nitin Tripathi said that schools have done all kinds of preparations for the vaccination. “There was a meeting on the day where all the officials have been instructed to ensure complete vaccination of the students and others in the age group of 15-18 years age group,” said Saxena. Notably, the vaccination against Covid-19 of 36 lakh school children in the 15-18 age group in Madhya Pradesh will begin from Monday, with plans afoot to administer doses to 12 lakh beneficiaries in this segment on the first day, a senior health official said. “We have plans to administer doses to 12 lakh children on Monday. The state had earlier set a record of 30 lakh doses in a single day. However, with children we can’t be hasty. After covering schoolchildren, we will target school dropouts,” he said. He added that 98 percent of eligible beneficiaries, or 5.22 crore out of 5.49 crore people, have got the second dose of the vaccine in the state. As per the official records, around 6% of 8.25 crore (population of MP) are children of the age group 15 years to 18 years. About the documents to be carried by the students Saxena said, “School I-D card is enough to take the vaccination. Even if students provide any other government card line Aadhar and others they will get the vaccination.” The biggest challenge while conducting vaccination for the 15-18 years children will be the schools’ drop-out. Around 22% of students are drop-out in class 10 in the state. In Bhopal, around 1.13 lakh students will have to be vaccinated in the age group of 15-18.DEO Saxena said that there are around 700 schools in Bhopal wherein 1 lakh students will have to be vaccinated in the age group of 15-18 years. “In Bhopal district, there are 40,297 students in the 15 years age group which is the highest number of students to be vaccinated in the 15-18 years age group,” said Saxena.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/over-1l-teenagers-to-get-the-jab-at-177-schools-in-bhopal/articleshow/88654930.cms||---
---||Delhi||AAP, BJP spar over Rajan Babu hospital||New Delhi: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has sought the resignation of North Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor Raja Iqbal Singh over the dilapidated building of Rajan Babu TB Hospital. An AAP functionary said the mayor should resign on moral grounds. “How will he take care of the entire corporation if he can’t take care of one hospital in his own ward? Despite the fact that the standing committee deemed the building dangerous, patients were being treated and the mayor was making false statements,” added the functionary. Addressing a press conference at AAP’s headquarters on Sunday, north corporation’s leader of opposition Vikas Goel said, “We went to the hospital and shared videos showing the structure in a dilapidated state. We also showed visuals of how patients were admitted on all floors. We filed a complaint the same evening at Mukherjee Nagar police station requesting that the premises be vacated.” “It’s a shame that functionaries of the BJP-led north corporation didn’t bother to visit the hospital and made bogus assertions. The mayor issued a statement claiming that no one was being treated in the wards. However, the chairman of the standing committee mentioned that 9-14 wards were operational and an attempt was being made to relocate patients. He also agreed that the structure was unsafe and experts from IIT-Roorkee had been asked to look into it,” claimed Goel. Reacting to the charges, Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said before targeting the mayor unnecessarily and demanding his resignation, AAP functionaries should clear their stand on the alleged incident in which three children died due to wrong medication at a mohalla clinic. “AAP MLA Atishi has made it a prestige issue to get Rajan Babu Hospital shut to satisfy her ego. Health minister Satyendar Jain gave an unjustified order to shut down the hospital. Before seeking the mayor’s resignation, AAP should tell when Jain will resign for the death of the three children,” said Kapoor.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/aap-bjp-spar-over-rajan-babu-hospital/articleshow/88653908.cms||---

The move came a day after former chief wildlife warden of the state, JS Suhag, had been issued a show-cause notice by additional chief secretary Anand Bardhan for failing to use his authority to stop the illegalities. “CTR has a specific line of command. Any activities happening here should not escape the notice of officials. We have sent a letter to the director asking for an explanation as to how the illegal construction was happening here without him knowing,” said Singhal. Illegal constructions in some of the most critical zones of Corbett were first highlighted in a TOI report last year. Taking suo motu cognisance of the report, the Uttarakhand HC directed the forest department to form a three-member committee to inspect the site and submit a report “with regard to the nature and extent of the illegal construction being carried out along with details of the people responsible for carrying out the same”. It had also ordered the department to spell out the steps being taken against the defaulters. TOI had highlighted through its report a visit by a team of the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) in September which confirmed the presence of illegal structures in Corbett. The NTCA team had termed the encroachments “an excellent example of administrative and managerial failure” and recommended a vigilance inquiry and action against errant forest officers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/illegal-constructions-corbett-director-issued-show-cause-notice/articleshow/88653423.cms||---

Sources said that the school education department is considering to instruct schools to conduct only online classes for test of the academic session soon. Even several schools are in confusion about opening the on-campus classes after the winter vacation.

In just seven days, 345 new active patients have been added and it has increased by more than double to 608 on January 2.Adding to the concern, during the past seven days, positivity rate — number of people testing positive out of every 100 samples tested — has increased by 300%. On December 27, it was only 0.05% ie, out of 2,000 samples tested only one person was positive. It has now increased to 0.20% on January 2, as in every 2000 samples tested, at least five were found positive.Given to the speed at which the infection is spreading in Madhya Pradesh, it is high time that people adhere to Covid-appropriate behaviour. The government should also intervene to ensure that appropriate Covid-19 behaviour like wearing masks, maintain social distance, maintaining hand hygiene, stopping all sorts of public gatherings is restricted, said experts. Vaccination should also be speeded up, even while ensuring adequate precautions. they warned.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/from-128-to-608-active-cases-rise-by-375-in-a-month-in-mp/articleshow/88654940.cms||Amarjeet Singh

---||Bhopal||How to keep your furry friends happy this winter||BHOPAL: Our furry friends need a little extra care during the ‘under-the-covers-front-of-heater’ weather . Pet parents share tips on how to keep our animals happy and warm during the winters. Like humans, pets too are susceptible to cold and cough. “To avoid risk of infection and cold during winters it is important to change pet’s drinking water regularly, because it tends to get cold really quickly,” says Diya Shrotiya, who has two dogs – Agatha and Candito. Dogs with flat faces—like pugs—have difficulty in breathing, and must be taken extra care of. Baths should be limited to once a month in winters,” says Neeti Khare, an animal activist who has three dogs – Ganga, Gauri and Netri. Allowing them time in the sun is important too, says Kankika Soni. “My cat loves sun bathing. We have put a bed and blanket for him on the terrace where he spends most of the morning,” she says. Tanu Awasthy, a dog parent and a member of Foster for Furballs, which helps in rehabilitation and rescue of animals, says ‘outside time’ for pets should be restricted during evenings. Play with them indoors in the evenings, so that they can release their energy. Pets forced to remain inactive for long hours may get irritable. Evening time is also jacket time. “It’s not correct to think that your dog does not feel cold because it has fur. Animals feel cold just like us. It is also essential to ensure that they have a comfortable and warm place to sleep,” says Neeti Khare, an animal activist. For those who wish to help stray animals, you can place old bed sheets in a secure dry place in your locality for them to sleep on, says Awasthy. Soni says she cuts up old clothes to repurpose them as sweaters for puppies in need. “Jute beds cost just Rs 100 and can help save lives of stray animals who do have any place to go to, to escape the harsh winters,” says Khare. Cats usually try to find warmth near tyres and under the engine of vehicles. Before you start your car check under your vehicle to avoid accidents. Van Vihar’s defence against the cold: To ensure that the wild animals are comfortable, the doors and windows of their rooms have been boarded up. A cot and room heater has also been placed in the shelter so that the animals can sleep comfortably.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/how-to-keep-your-furry-friends-happy-this-winter/articleshow/88654944.cms||Tanya Srivastava

At crowded places, too, people are seen without wearing masks in plenty. And, if questioned, their response ranges from blatant "What is your problem if I am not wearing masks?" to " I develop infection if I continue wearing masks for a long time" to " I have breathing problem that's why I don't wear masks" to "I had just taken off the mask to click a photograph." As people turned up in large numbers for outing during the last three days to celebrate arrival of new year, crowd in markets and places like Van Vihar, Sair Sapata and Museum of Man swelled and despite the fact that at some of these places security guards were checking masks at the entry gate, a large number of people could be seen without masks and social distancing was obviously out of question. When TOI asked a youngster at Sair Sapata, why doesn't he wear a mask, came the reply' I am not wearing a mask because I don't want to. Do you have any problems?" In New Market, too, a lot of people were not wearing masks despite the fact that many of them knew that the Corona cases were on the rise and the third wave seems imminent. A trader said, "When the media was talking about the third wave in September or October, I knew it would happen in the new year- somewhere in February or March as it had happened in 2021. At that time, we were told to get vaccinated, but vaccination has also failed to control the pandemic as several countries are already facing the Omicron wave. I don't know how much a mask saves you from infection but if it helps, people should wear it.” When asked why he is not wearing the mask himself, he said, "I have just opened the shop, so I have taken it off and otherwise also, you cannot wear the mask all the time but when there is a buyer in the shop, I do put up the mask." The administration, police and Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC), which had so far been avoiding imposing a penalty for violation of Covid protocol particularly for not wearing a mask at public places because the daily count of new Corona cases was generally in single digit may start a campaign to enforce the Covid norms in right earnest after the cases reached the figure of 24 on Saturday and 42 on Sunday. "Along with the awareness campaign, the administration will start fining people too for not wearing masks though vaccination drive is still our top priority as children in the age group of 15 to 18 years have to be vaccinated from tomorrow. 40,000 children in this age group will be vaccinated on Monday, pre-booking of 8,000 has already been done", said spokesperson for the district administration, Arun Rathore.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/bhopalis-shun-covid-norms-despite-threat-of-omicron/articleshow/88654948.cms||---

The chief minister should break his silence on this issue, he said.“If the state government has denied such a recommendation from the chancellor, then it has insulted the President of the country,” said the Union minister. “The state government has no moral authority to interfere in the matters of universities, and it is also a matter of concern that Kerala University syndicate has not even considered the chancellor’s recommendation,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/satheesan-has-become-pinarayis-spokesman/articleshow/88654952.cms||---

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Potters slowly tread their way back to life||Thiruvananthapuram: The ´kumbarans´ of Aruvancode village in Nilambur have been sleeplessly working for the past one month. The Aruvancode village is well known for its pottery products including murals, sculptures and kitchen utensils.Vijayakumari M is one such person who came to Thiruvananthapuram as a representative of the village hoping to see the result of the villagers’ hard work.The pandemic hit the pottery makers very badly and the sale also went down. Vijayakumari has collected products from the 50 families in the village to help them sell the products. She has been doing this for the past 22 years. This time she decided to exhibit the products in Thiruvananthapuram. The reason behind such a decision is the recognition and profit she received last time when she conducted the expo in the state capital.The terracotta products, including tawa, varieties of pots, jug, cup, frying pan, showcase items, sculptures, indoor plant pots and candle stands are showcased in the terracotta exhibition being held at Gandhi Bhavan, Thycaud. The exhibition will end on January 5. The price of the product varies between Rs 100 to Rs 2,000. Even though this is the first day of the exhibition, Vijayakumari is happy about the sale.“While thinking about an exhibition and sale, the first place that came to my mind is Thiruvananthapuram. This is my third exhibition here. The reason behind that is the recognition and profit I got last time when I organized an exhibition in the city. Many people here still use this traditional terracotta utensil. In order to make more products for the expo, I have taken out a loan. I believe that I can repay the money with the profit,” said Vijayakumari M.The products are made in such a way that it can be even used in the oven. It will take a week to finish the work of a product which will also undergo polishing. The high-quality clay to make the products has been sourced from Palakkad.

For this, the interested labourers will be given training to enhance coconut farming. The farmers can contact the farm army for all activities regarding coconut farming in the wards, including Kazhakootam, Chanthavila and Kattaikonam. The services, including manuring, weed and pest prevention, and planting new saplings will be available. The labourers will be paid an amount of Rs 100 per tree. The budget for the scheme is Rs 50 lakhs.“I have seen a large number of people complaining about the diseases of coconut trees. All I could do was to prescribe medicines for that. But in order to apply the medicines to the affected part, they have to climb the tree. But almost all the farmers are not able to climb the tree. So, we have decided to help them by providing labourers for coconut farming. In order for the coconut cultivation to thrive, we need to start from the very bottom. That is why training is provided at the ward level. In addition to recovering old coconut trees, new coconut seedlings will also be planted,’‘said Deepa S, agriculture officer of Kazhakootam Krishi Bhavan.The rhinoceros beetles parasitizing in the tender part of the coconut tree results in bud rot disease and the tree will get destroyed. The beetles live in the stagnant cow dung. The agricultural department has also come up with a solution to resolve this issue by introducing the cultivation of trichoderma mushrooms in cow dung. The trichoderma is a fungus with antagonistic effects. It has the ability to fight against other fungus. Thus, this will also prevent the tree from bud rot diseases.The livestock farmers are being trained to make trichoderma from the stagnant cow dung. This has also given them an opportunity to get an income and can also avoid hassle caused by stagnant cow dung. The manure thus made will be paid an amount of Rs 15 per kilogram.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/farm-army-to-battle-issues-in-coconut-cultivation/articleshow/88654957.cms||---
---||Delhi||Letter & spirit: Dak Bhavan courtyard turns over a new leaf||New Delhi: The centre of Dak Bhavan, which used to be a dump yard, has undergone a transformation that was unimaginable till a few years ago. The courtyard, now titled Frangipani Aangan, was created as a place to connect by Central Postal Ladies Organisation (CPLO), a non-profit registered society of the Department of Post, which undertakes community work in addition to their official responsibilities. The courtyard’s walls are adorned with Warli art, Sanskrit shlokas in delicate calligraphy and its windows are covered in glass artwork. It reiterates the idea of a harmonious workplace where anyone can take a few moments of respite. CPLO also operates four creches and a cafeteria. A senior functionary of CPLO said, “Some brilliant ideas got exchanged when we were sitting, talking and connecting with each other a few years ago. It helped one realise that there was more to life than just file work.” It is hard to believe that Frangipani Aangan, covered with beautiful champa trees and bamboo plants, was not too long ago the desert of out of order coolers, airconditioners, water tanks and broken furniture. Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for Swachh Bharat Abhiyan a few years ago, Smriti Sharan, a senior IPoS official, and her colleagues set about cleaning the dump yard. India Post Payments Bank and the then CEO AP Singh supported CPLO’s endeavour by funding the entire project. In his recent Mann Ki Baat address, Modi commended the formation of Frangipani Aangan, which was a proud moment for Sharan and CPLO. Calligrapher Shipra Rohatgi and plant stylist Namrata Yadav were commissioned by CPLO to do the unimaginable and their all-women team worked relentlessly for three months to make Frangipani Aangan a reality. “We also have very supportive male colleagues who dreamt the dream with us. Once we set the ball rolling, there was no stopping us,” said another IPoS officer. The Sanskrit shlokas profess the virtues of keeping the earth green, by planting flowers and fruit-bearing trees. The glass art is a mix of murals and catchy Hindi words that signify the myriad moods found in nature like dhwani, aviral, sangeet, suryoday, raag-rang, etc. The quotes were picked up from the Puranas in the National Archives. The tapestry artwork gives a sense of windows overlooking the past. “The PM spoke about CPLO because it has that power to connect women and empower them. Over time, we have become one big family. Though we are immersed in our own spaces and are busy doing our work, we come together to give back to the community,” said Sharan. During the pandemic, CPLO members held food distribution drives for migrant workers. They also stitched and sterilised masks for frontline workers by following an assembly line production system and collecting and distributing essentials in Meerut, Modinagar and Muradnagar. The UP government gave them support by asking police to assist them in their mission to feed the masses. They worked solely on crowdsourced funds. “It has been a life changing experience for us. When we came together to create this beautiful space, it gave us a bond that has lasted years. It made us find our purpose and opened us to new unexpected experiences,” said CPLO member Namrata Yadav. Sharan said, “Frangipani Aangan serves as a wonderful example of all the possibilities that come into being when ideas are shared and heard and people come together to give back to the society. The mission is to create small islands of tranquillity and beauty where people can always meet and connect.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/letter-spirit-dak-bhavan-courtyard-turns-over-a-new-leaf/articleshow/88653448.cms||Arundhati Jain

In some areas, overgrown wild bushes provide enough cover for these creatures to hide and frequently appear in the open where they attack dogs and pigs. A motorcyclist said that he was recently chased by a leopard while travelling home to Khawat. The animal disappeared when some vehicles were seen on the road. However, last week, two leopards were sighted at Gotcamolem, following which several motorcyclists had to make a retreat, and it was only after phoning their friends that they made a safe journey home. Gotcamolem residents had written to the deputy conservator of forests, Margao, highlighting the thick bushes that have grown in the uncultivated and abandoned fields situated in the vicinity of their homes. Even the range forest officer (RFO), Canacona and RFO wildlife visited the place and took stock of the situation. The residents of these areas expressed alarm after wild cats have been attacking domesticated dogs and pigs. It is learnt that a wild cat also attacked a calf at Ardhofond. Some residents in Agonda also informed that wild cats have lifted their petdogs. CCTV footage at one place recently captured a leopard entering the verandah at a house in Agonda and pounced on a dog tied to a leash. Inmates in the house awoke to the dog’s cries, and opened the door to find the leopard disappearing into the darkness.  While locals admit that the wildcats have been sighted often, and have lifted only domesticated animals, they are afraid that humans could soon be the target of such attacks.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/fear-grips-canacona-locals-as-leopards-attack-dog-pigs/articleshow/88654315.cms||---

What is sanctioned strength, and vacancies of doctors and nurses at the Civil hospital in Ahmedabad? What are the names of persons whom SVP hospital has administered Remdesivir injections? How many Covid-19 deaths have taken place at AMC-run hospitals? In all the above instances, information was not provided to applicants who filed queries under Right to Information (RTI) Act citing confidentiality clause as the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 is in force. Ever since the outbreak of Covid-19 almost two years ago, public authorities, especially those in the health sector, have been denying information by citing section 4 of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, allege activists. RTI activist Alpesh Bhavsar says earlier this year he sought information on patients treated by private designated Covid-19 hospitals and the expenses incurred. Six of the seven Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) zones said information was confidential under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, one zone provided it. “The authorities cite section 4 of the Epidemic Diseases Act, but all we are seeking is information. There is no intention of initiating legal proceedings. When we appeal, authorities are then forced to provide information,” he said. Section 4 of the said act has no mention of not providing information. It in fact grants protection to persons against legal proceedings for anything done in good faith, say activists. Section 4 of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 reads – “Protection to persons acting under Act. No suit or other legal proceeding shall lie against any person for anything done or in good faith intended to be done under this Act.” In almost all such cases, RTI activists have had to go for appeals, with the respective public authority or the commission when a majority of the information should ideally be part of voluntary disclosure. RTI activist Pankaj Bhatt sought information on th number of Covid-19 deaths in AMC-run hospitals since the outbreak. “The AMC cities confidentiality clauses, but the law regarding birth and deaths says these figures should be updated on the government website periodically,” Bhatt said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/officials-use-corona-to-mask-rti-queries/articleshow/88654960.cms||Meghdoot Sharon

Legal ownership rights (property cards/title deeds) are issued by mapping of land parcels using drone technology. The scheme aims to cover all the villages across the country by March 2025.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/drone-flying-under-svamitva-takes-off/articleshow/88654967.cms||---

Cumin acreage at present is 35% lower than the area sown with the spice in the same period last year.Gujarat has seen around 3 lakh hectares sown with cumin as of December 27, 2021. Cumin acreage stood at 4.46 lakh hectares at the same point in the last rabi season, shows weekly data compiled by the state agriculture department. Cumin cultivation has reached just 69% of the three-year average acreage of 4.35 lakh hectares. Market players attribute the reduction in area under cumin to diversion to other crops, mainly mustard and gram (chana). The trend, according to market players, is more or less the same in neighbouring Rajasthan, which is another important cumin growing state in the country. “While cumin prices remained stable throughout 2021, oilseed prices rallied sharply following the surge in edible oil prices. As a result, a large number of farmers have turned to mustard this rabi season, as mustard oil prices touched a record high,” said a member of the Federation of Indian Spice Stakeholders (FISS). The switch to mustard/rapeseed could be seen from the fact that its acreage in the state has jumped substantially to 3.35 lakh hectares as of the last week of December 2021 from 2.13 lakh hectares at the same point last year. Mustard acreage at present is 173% of the three-year average for the crop. The area under gram (chana) has risen to 10.19 lakh hectare this rabi season from 7.83 lakh hectares last season.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/cumin-acreage-declines-in-state/articleshow/88654968.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Public spaces can be increased by land management: Study||Ahmedabad: The Cept University’s City Studio for the budding urban planners looked at Ahmedabad from different lenses of space usage, public transport, walkability, requirement of water and solid waste generations among others.The studio encompassed mapping by the students for the space usage and potential for development. A senior faculty member said that due to unplanned development during the formative years of the city, many setbacks – the land pockets around developed plot with or without structure which are not utilized – are created. Such setbacks are relatively less in the newer areas with introduction of TP schemes. Likewise, the western city parts also had relatively higher share of the setbacks – Navrangpura had 41% such land compared to 13% in Odhav due to higher built-up area.Senior Cept University officials said that the idea of the City Studio was to give the students a peek into how the city functions on multiple levels and tweaking even one factor can have implications on its nature and characteristics. One of the projects explored the growth of the city over the decades and factors that shaped the modern city, whereas another project highlighted how Amdavadis are preferring private vehicles – mostly two-wheelers – for commute over public transport.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/public-spaces-can-be-increased-by-land-management-study/articleshow/88654969.cms||---

The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on Friday named K L Rahul as the captain of the Indian team for the ODI series against South Africa after injured Rohit Sharma was ruled out and named the Gujarat pacer as Rahul’s deputy.Bumrah’s ascendancy to the second top-most position follows his stupendous performance in all three formats of the game. His 106 wickets in 25 Tests have been the cornerstone of India’s two triumphs Down Under and the Covid-curtailed Test series in England. He also has 108 wickets in 67 ODIs besides 66 scalps in 55 T20Is.The Gujarat Cricket Association (GCA) on Saturday said it was a proud moment for Gujarat that Bumrah has been named the vice-captain of the team. GCA secretary Anil Patel told TOI, “Prior to this, cricketers from Gujarat were part of the senior Indian team but have never helmed or deputized.”  “He is a deserving candidate for this post as he has performed wonderfully well over the last few years. But being named as vice-captain of the team actually came as a surprise for us. Generally, in India, batters are preferred for leadership positions. Very few bowlers have become captain or vice-captain of the team,” Anil stated. For the record, leg spinner Anil Kumble, who retired in 2008, was the last bowler to captain India before M S Dhoni took over the reins. Former Gujarat captain Parthiv Patel, who retired in December 2020, had captained the Indian U-19 team but was never a regular in the senior team though he played 25 Tests, 38 ODIs and two T20Is. Prior to him, Gujarat cricketers Jasu Patel, Deepak Shodhan and Dhiraj Parsana represented India but none were regulars in the team.Former head coach of Gujarat Vijay Patel, under whom Bumrah and Parthiv began their career, said the pacer's experience at international level made selectors go for him as the vice-captain. “It’s a very good opportunity for him as once Rohit is back, Rahul would be his deputy. Selectors went for him as he has good international experience,” Vijay told TOI over phone. “Though Bumrah never captained Gujarat, his inputs were very relevant. He is a calm and composed cricketer who knows how to handle the pressure,” Vijay added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/bumrahs-elevation-as-vice-captain-a-proud-moment-for-gujarat-cricket/articleshow/88654970.cms||Sabu Cherian

---||Ahmedabad||Rasikas sit far apart safely, get more soul room||AHMEDABAD: The select, double-jabbed group that comprises the audience of Saptak 2022 would have pleased John Milton. In Book 7 of “Paradise Lost”, he writes: “Still govern thou my song/Urania, and fit audience find, though few.” Perhaps some will imagine Milton sanitizing his hands with snobbery when he calls for intellectual fitness. But Saptak rasikas, both the connoisseurs and the tentative tasters of classical, have the necessary cultural qualification: being human. Raga carries in its meaning “colour”, “mood”, and “passion”. Aficionados have more sensitive receptors for those three raga ingredients than beginners. But like Shakespeare, classical music can be unravelled for wealthy surprises at any level. At this year’s Saptak, fitness bears a clinical load rather than the weight of aesthetics. The organizers have acted responsibly by restricting the audience size to 400. In the pre-pandemic era, more than 4,000 people usually came for the acme of the festival’s offerings. The new arrangements make no difference to Dr Ashwini Bhide-Deshpande, scheduled to perform on Monday. When TOI asked her what she thought of the possibility of sparser shouts of acclaim, she said: “I never aspired to the ‘wahs’ and the buzz.” She added: “I aspire only to the grace of God and the grace of the raga.” In the 2013 Saptak edition, Bhide-Deshpande offered both forms of grace by presenting “Mahadeva Shankara” in Raga Jhinjhoti. Some took a dose of devotion from this doyenne of the Jaipur-Atrauli Gharana, others enjoyed a shot of purely rational pleasure of music. Yet another section of the audience, one suspects, received an emotional booster from a combination of both the jabs.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/rasikas-sit-far-apart-safely-get-more-soul-room/articleshow/88654973.cms||Kannan Somasundaram
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: PPA fresh queries put brakes on Polavaram project||AMARAVATI: The wait to get the final investment clearance for the Polavaram project is getting longer as the Polavaram Project Authority (PPA) has raised fresh queries about the number of total oustees in the submerged villages. The PPA had also directed the state government to get the stay on environmental objections extended by the ministry of environment, forests and climate change. With jal shakti ministry promising to clear the proposal after getting suitable recommendations from the PPA, the state government is anxiously waiting for the PPA’s call. Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy is visiting New Delhi to seek support from the Centre to clear hurdles in Polavaram project. In fact, the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) appointed by the jal shakti ministry had stamped its nod for payment of Rs 47,725 crore under revised cost estimates (RCE) almost a year ago. The TAC studied thousands of documents submitted by the state government and also went through various objections and suggestions made by the experts. It had also examined the proposal cleared by Central Water Commission (CWC) which had in fact put the project cost around Rs 54,000 crore at 2018-19 price level. The TAC had brought down the cost to Rs 47,725 crore and forwarded it to the finance ministry for final approval. To the utter shock of the state government, finance ministry reiterated that it was committed to pay the project cost only at 2013-14 price level which is around Rs 23,000 crore. After deducting the amounts reimbursed to the state, finance ministry wanted to pay the balance amount around Rs 8,000 crore. Rattled with the finance ministry’s response, the chief minister and YSRCP MPs exerted pressure on the Centre to reconsider its decision and grant funds at 2018-19 price level. Subsequently, the finance ministry asked the jal shakti ministry to re-evaluate the project cost by removing drinking water component. At this juncture, jal shakti ministry directed the Polavaram Project Authority (PPA) to re-examine the entire proposal and send suitable recommendations. The state irrigation department had already submitted voluminous records to the PPA seeking its support to put the cost at Rs 47,725 crore. However, the PPA has been delaying sending the final recommendations seeking clarification after clarification from the state government for the past eight months.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/ppa-fresh-queries-put-brakes-on-polavaram/articleshow/88652907.cms||Samdani MN

She had clicked the link to get delivery updates, mentioned an FIR filed with the Vastrapur police station on Saturday. The victim is Apurva Munet, 25, a resident of Samruddhi Apartments, who hails from Madhya Pradesh. She has been working as a senior interior designer with a private firm in Thaltej for the past two years. She stated in her FIR that she had ordered one pair of denim trousers on November 28 and another on November 29 from a shopping portal of a leading denim company. Munet said in her FIR that the pair she had ordered on November 28 was delivered on December 3. But there was no sign of the November 29 order. On December 14, she searched for the customer care number of the delivery firm concerned. She called the number and a person asked her for the tracking ID and confirmed that her package was with the delivery firm. She asked him if she could collect her package personally. But the man insisted that their courier would make the delivery. The man told her to update her address by paying Rs 3 using a link sent to her. Following his instruction, she paid the money after which she received a confirmation message. Later, the man called and asked for her preferred delivery time. On December 14, at around 8.30pm, she began receiving messages about money being deducted from her two bank accounts linked to a UPI payment app. In all, she ended up losing Rs 94,000. Having realized that she had been cheated, she approached Vastrapur police and filed a complaint.

A senior police officer said that cybercrooks send emails with attached malicious links and files. If people open such a link or a file, their system —cellphone or computer — is compromised and criminals gain access to vital information. Recently, the cyber cell of the state police issued an advisory on cybercrooks using the Omicron test lure. In some instances, when someone hoping to get a free test clicks a link, bank account information is sought innocuously. Those gullible enough to divulge private information find their accounts emptied, according to the advisory issued by the cyber cell on December 30. In many cases, people ended up sharing their details with fraudsters and lost their money in this time of crisis, said a police officer. The officer said that a formal complaint is yet to be filed in relation to such cheating cases. “In most cases, people receive an email which is ostensibly from the National Health Service (NHS) of the UK,” the officer said. “The message offers the Omicron test.” The email senders also instill fear by saying that if the test is not taken, the recipient will be placed in isolation to prevent the spread of the infection, said the officer. “So people are lured with a free test and threatened by the prospect of isolation,” said another senior police officer. “Some people fall into the trap and are cheated.” Sources in the state police said that cybercrooks also trawl the browsing history of a target and reach out if information on the Omicron test has been looked up. Moreover, cybercrooks use addresses that appear to be from private and government hospitals. Police advise people to scrutinize domain names to check the authenticity of websites and report any suspicious activity on the cybercrime portal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/omicron-test-lure-bank-accounts-emptied/articleshow/88654981.cms||---

A complaint has been filed with Ahmedabad Police. The two were accompanied by a judicial magistrate first class (JMFC), who like them is from Korba district of Chhattisgarh. But she has not been made an accused in the case. According to sources in railway police, the accused are Ravi and Sharad Pandey. Sharad is an advocate in Korba. A complaint filed by a commercial supervisor in Western Railway, Azizkhan Pathan, states that Sharad posed as a high court judge and Ravi was introduced as a health officer. They brandished a letter apparently signed by a senior deputy commercial manager of Western Railway. So they were given the facilities they demanded. On December 26, Sharad called the Gir-Somnath collector and the sub-divisional magistrate and identified himself as a deputy secretary of the law ministry from Delhi. He told the collector that a high court judge, soon to be promoted to the Supreme Court, and two advocates were coming to the Somnath temple. He asked the collector to make arrangements for VIP rooms, protocol officers, and vehicles. Sharad made similar calls to sub-divisional magistrate Saryu Zankar. However, when there was no message from Gandhinagar, Zankar got suspicious and informed police. On inquiring, police learnt that Sharad, Ravi, and the JMFC had taken a flight from Raipur to Ahmedabad. The brothers had asked the deputy commercial manager of Western Railway to arrange rooms in the guesthouse. Sharad and Ravi visited the temple town of Dwarka and there they had introduced themselves as IAS officers. Sources in police said that the brothers craved VVIP attention. An investigation is underway to determine the benefits they took as VVIPs, causing a loss to the public exchequer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/vip-con-2-dupe-wr-posing-as-judge-health-officer/articleshow/88654983.cms||---

Input of tomatoes from Madanapalle once again picked up pace and the cost of tomatoes fell to Rs 42 per kilogram at wholesale markets. The cost of okra, ridge gourd and other vegetables have also come down by 40%. “The price of vegetables usually registers a sudden fall in winter. But a shortage of vegetables resulted in price hike and customers cut down on their shopping lists. The market is recovering slowly and we are expecting sales to boost during Sankranti season,” said M Ragunath Reddy, a wholesale trader from Kaleswara Rao market. Rajiv Gandhi wholesale market and Patamata rythu bazaar were flooded with consumers on Sunday and sellers arranging queues following Covid-19 guidelines.

On December 24 last year, the state law department formally notified the law, which is titled “The Jharkhand State Employment of Local Candidates in Private Sector Act, 2021”. The law mandates tighter norms for employers to follow the mandate. Under the law, the government will set up a dedicated website where the local candidates can register themselves to get employment. Only the registered candidates can avail benefits of the new law. Employers, which include companies, MSME units, societies, limited liability partnership firms or any individual who is employing 10 people or more, will have to fill up 75% of its total post vacancies which have a gross monthly salary of Rs 40,000 or less, through local candidates from the website. The employers can hire non-locals only if the local candidates fail to match the skills, qualifications and proficiency of the notified job. The exemptions can be sought before a five-member enquiry committee headed by the local MLA and comprising the deputy commissioner, circle officer, district labour superintendent and the district employment officer. The employers will also have to furnish quarterly reports to the government about their vacancies and recruitment through the designated portal.

In a letter to the Ranchi deputy commissioner-cum-chairman of the district disaster management authority on Sunday, additional chief secretary (ACS) Arun Singh said, “There is an urgent need for Ranchi district to consider strict Covid management and control measures in the surge areas to bring the situation under control.” Singh said the district reported 99 cases from December 19 to 25 and they rose to 1,300 from December 26 to January 1. He added that the positivity rate of the district increased to 3.01% against 0.26% earlier. Singh said: “The issue needs to be addressed pro-actively and immediately to ensure that neither transmission spreads further nor we reach a situation of increased mortality due to late detection of cases.” The ACS advised the district to enhance testing in a focused manner while maintaining a ratio between RT-PCR and RAT. He advised the administration must conduct pro-active contact tracing and either isolate or quarantine the contacts of Covid-positive patients. At least 30 contacts per positive case must be traced and tested within 24 hours, he added. The ACS directed that a single war room should be established with logistics to strengthen the contact tracing system. The ACS said the five-fold strategy of testing, tracking, isolation, treatment and vaccination must be followed and the pace of vaccination should be increased in district. Singh added that the critical infrastructure, including beds, human resources, equipment, drugs and consumables need to be ensured. The ACS cautioned that the district administration should not be lulled by the data as Omicron is equally fatal for those who are not vaccinated and have co-morbidities. He said going by the trend of rising cases, the state will have 20,000 active cases by the second week of January. Instructions have been issued to all districts in this regard, the ACS added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/take-steps-to-contain-covid-surge-govt-to-ranchi-admin/articleshow/88655002.cms||Sanjay Sahay

The state recorded 1,007 fresh cases on Saturday. From Monday, the state government will roll out the vaccination for the 15-18 years age group as part of the nationwide drive, but the abrupt surge in the number of infections in the state has put many into a quandary. Madhulika Jaiswal, a class XII student of Jawahar Vidhya Mandir (JVM), said, “As there is a sharp rise in the coronavirus cases across the state, it is better that the schools shift to the online mode. Amid such rapid increase in the cases, one is likely to get infected. Although the schools are taking precautions, we students will obviously interact with our friends and classmates, which somehow may add up to the total number of cases as we are unable to detect who is infected and who is not.” Anuj Kumar, a class VIII student of Bishop Westcott Boys’ School Namkum, said, “Schools should totally be functioning online in view of the rising cases. Offline classes may lead to an increase in the cases amid the new variant scare. We are not willing to attend physical classes now.

Of those 26,181, over 6000 were moderate anaemic pregnant women. The information was compiled for a divisional review meeting of health services held in the last week of December last year.The high-risk conditions among pregnant women include those above 35 years of age, obese, have a pre-existing illness like blood pressure, history of clotting in limbs, said regional director (health services) Indore division Dr Ashok Dagaria. “The monitoring of high-risk pregnant women is done to prevent any complications at time of delivery and avoid any fatalities there. The better monitoring during the pregnancy further helped in reducing those illness”, said Dr Ashok Dagaria. The identification could be done because the division reported high ANC registration, said Dr Dagaria. ANC registration leads to regular check-up helping in early diagnosis of high-risk pregnant women among them prompting interventions on time leading to reduction in chances of maternal death during deliveries, said Dr Dagaria. “The registrations are the most useful for pregnant women from deprived classes helping them in getting benefits of the various welfare schemes of the government”, added Dr Dagaria.

---||Agra||Woman on protest for 81 days dies at dharna site||Agra: Rani Devi, 48 -- who had been protesting for 81 days demanding a road and proper drainage system in Dhanoli, Ajeejpura and Siroli villages in Agra – died at the protest site on Sunday morning. Other protesters said she had gone to sleep the night before but did not wake up in the morning. Another woman, sleeping next to Rani, was rushed to hospital in an unconscious state. Locals have been staging protests in the area for past 81 days and have expressed themselves in many different ways to get their voices heard. They shouted slogans at the district headquarters, went bald, sat inside potholes and waterlogged roads, went on a hunger strike, and placed posters to boycott the coming assembly elections. A few of them even pasted “for sale” banners on the walls of their houses. Rani was a resident of Vikas Nagar, under the jurisdiction of Malpura police station. She had been regularly protesting at the Siroli-Dhanoli road protest site since October 13. She was living with her 22-year-old son, Neeraj (first name only) in a rented house near the site. Neeraj, a labourer at a shoe manufacturing unit, said, “I used to tell my mother to not go to the protest site at night but she was adamant. She had slept there on Saturday. She didn’t wake up when I went to give her tea on Sunday morning. Her body was cold and stiff. We called a doctor who declared her dead. The district administration is solely responsible her death.” Confirming that Rani died at the protest site, SDM Lakshmi N said, “The body has been sent for post-mortem. We will try to give the family some monetary assistance from the chief minister's relief fund and benefits under other government schemes.” Meanwhile, the other woman who fell unconscious is 85-year-old Kirti Devi. On December 5, Kirti, along with one Chaudhary Prem Singh, had dug up land near the protest site and observed a sit-in protest. Social activist Savitri Chahar, who is leading the protest, said, “In the past three years, we have raised issues such as lack of sanitation and hygiene, waterlogging, and poor road and drainage. We had staged a protest over these issues last year as well following which the local authorities told us they will resolve the issue of waterlogging, but nothing has been done so far. Public representatives also turned a blind eye to our problems.” Chahar told TOI that waterlogging damaged many houses in the area. She said pothole-riddled roads caused many accidents and lack of cleanliness and negligence by local authorities caused death of at least 10 children due to viral fever and dengue in September and November. District magistrate Prabhu N Singh said, “Development works worth Rs 43 crore have been proposed for Dhanoli and nearby areas. Following the demand of locals, construction of roads was initiated. Earlier, temporary arrangements were made to clear waterlogging. We are also working to develop a permanent drainage system. Suitable help will be provided to the deceased woman's family.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/woman-on-protest-for-81-days-dies-at-dharna-site/articleshow/88652946.cms||Deepak Lavania

The Department of Collegiate Education (DCE) through a circular dated January 1, 2022, has asked college principals to ensure that students participate in the survey in which youth up to the age of 29 can participate. The questionnaire has questions related to how Covid-19 impacted the lives of the youth, whether they got the education of their choice in their place, the reason for dropping out of studies, access to career counselling centres, reasons for unemployment, the relevance of the education they had pursued to get employment, aspiration to engage with the political leadership, the support system for mental health issues, participation in local self-government activities like gram sabhas, ward committees, civil society organisations, expectations from the government of Karnataka to enhance ease of living, climate change, human development index and other issues. Panel member Chakravarthi Sulibele said the idea behind this exercise was to get feedback from the youth on their expectations while preparing the new youth policy. “We want to prepare a realistic policy,” he said. “All these days, the policies were prepared behind four walls of a building. But we want to prepare a policy that will help the youth in getting empowered. Panel members are visiting various districts to ensure that a huge number of the youth participate in this drive,” he said. Girish N Gowda, a para Olympian, said: “The new policy should give more stress towards building a healthy society and enable the youth to be independent. It should cover all critical areas of human development, including physical and mental health, quality education, sports, etc. It should be implemented in a timebound manner.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/panel-seeks-feedback-from-students-on-youth-policy/articleshow/88655014.cms||---

These are basic needs of industries and to promote manufacturing at local levels, the state should subsidies basic requirements.”Demand of electricity by industries in the year 2021 has jumped by around 10 per cent from a year earlier due to increased usage and new connections in industrial belts.Industries of Indore, Pithampur and nearby areas consumed 570 crore units of electricity from January to December 20, up by 10 per cent from a year ago, according to Madhya Pradesh Western Region Power Distribution Company. Daily demand of electricity in industries this year remained between 1.40 crore units to 1.61 crore units and a total of 570 crore units were consumed until Dec 20 this year, according to Madhya Pradesh Western Region Power Distribution Company.Madhya Pradesh Western Region Power Distribution Company managing director Amit Tomar said, “Electricity demand has jumped this year because many new industrial connections were provided and production capacities in industries picked up post pandemic requiring more electricity.” Virendra Kumar Porwal, executive president, Malwa Chamber of Commerce and Industries said, “The state government should keep a cap on the rates of electricity because with fixed and minimum charges per unit rates for small units come over Rs 10 per unit and this is a major deterrent.” Industries of Pithampur, Indore and Dewas constitute over 70% of total consumption.

As many as 71 students from five villages of the taluk have not attended classes, as their parents migrated to the coffee estates in Kerala with their children, after getting jobs there, through which they can earn daily wages. According to S C Shivamurthy, block education officer (BEO), Gundlupet, this issue happens every year, even though the education department is working hard to convince the parents to not allow their children to disrupt their education. “This year 71 students from Bhimanabeedu, Kothanur, Annur, Bhimanapura, and Kodahalli have gone to the coffee estates in Kerala along with their parents. A total 70 of these students are are from four of the above mentioned villages, while a student is from Bhimanabeedu,” he said. “Earlier, 200-250 students were going to Kerala with their parents every year. After continuous efforts, we are able to bring down this number now. Last year, due to Covid-19, they didn’t go to Kerala,” he said. “Two years ago, I had visited a few coffee estates in Kerala, to bring back the students. In these coffee estates, the parents are able to earn Rs 700 to Rs 800 per day. They get paid on Saturdays. As this amount is lucrative for them, the families go to Kerala to work. We tried to convince them not to take their children, by providing them hostel facilities, or getting them admitted in schools where their relatives stay, but a few parents still take their children along with them to Kerala,” he said. “Generally, a majority of the families return by Shivaratri, while a few return by Ugadi. This is a seasonal migration,” he added. According to the authorities, many agents work for the coffee estate to find labourers. Taluk Teachers’ Association president Mahesh said that poor families migrate more in search of work, as the job opportunities in the taluk are less. “Gundlupet’s economy is based on rain-based farming activities. After the rainy season, job opportunities come down. So, the families migrate in search of jobs,” he said. Shrikant Raje Urs, executive officer, Gundlupet taluk panchayat, said that awareness is being created among the people, to avail jobs under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), instead of going to Kerala.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/parents-leave-for-kerala-71-kids-set-to-miss-school-in-mysuru/articleshow/88655020.cms||Shrinivasa M

As on December 30, the district vaccinated 97% of its eligible population, with the first dose of the vaccine. It has set a target to vaccinate 7.8 lakh people, by administering the first dose of the vaccine. Yelandur taluk has achieved 101% target achievement, Chamarajanagar (96%), Gundlupet (95%), Kollegal (98%) and Hanur (96%), in administering the first dose of the vaccine. The vaccination drive began in the last week of January 2021, in a phased manner, by first inoculating health department staff and frontline Covid warriors. It ran successfully for the initial few months, but had to be stopped due to a shortage of vaccines in the middle of 2021, when the second wave of the pandemic started in the district. Though the district received enough stock of vaccines in the coming months, people hesitated to get jabbed, when Covid cases started to drop in the district. Despite such ups and downs, the district administration and health department were successful in implementing the vaccination drive launched by the government. The district has achieved 73% of its target, by vaccinating over 5.7 lakh people with both doses of the vaccine. Though the people were voluntarily coming in large numbers in towns, hobli headquarters and city limits, the health department officials faced a lot of challenges in a few pockets of rural areas, due to the vaccine hesitancy of residents of tribal hamlets and in villages on the fringes of forests. However, with the coordination of officials from the revenue, health, panchayat raj and police departments, the district is now inching closer to achieving 100% vaccination coverage, by convincing the people who hesitated to receive the jab, to get vaccinated, said Dr Ankappa, Chamarajanagar reproductive child health officer. Speaking to TOI, Chamarajanagar district health officer Dr K M Visveshwaraiah said that the district health authorities have intensified the vaccination drive to cover the remaining eligible population, who were left out from receiving the first and second doses, following directions from deputy commissioner Charulatha Somal. Instructions have been given to all taluk health medical officials to ensure 100% vaccination coverage by the end of this month, with effective coordination with ASHA workers and education, panchayat raj and revenue department officials. “As the government announced that those between 15 and 18 will be vaccinated, the district administration has made preparations by holding special camps to inoculate those in this age group. The district health authorities are strictly enforcing measures to ensure that people follow Covid-appropriate behaviour, with the help of local administration officials, amid the threat of the Omicron variant of the novel coronavirus,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/vaccination-drive-on-track-in-chamarajanagar/articleshow/88655024.cms||---

Charging the BJP with using leaders belonging to ‘Shudra’ communities to justify the decision, Siddaramaiah dubbed the proposal ‘anti-Hindu’. “Temples are independent even now, and the government is only nurturing them. When the government is administering them, even the last person has the right to enter them. By taking them out of the government’s purview, temples may be barred to Dalits again, which will be a blow to the values of the Sharana movement. The people must oppose this proposal,” the former CM said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/siddaramaiah-opposes-move-by-govt-to-free-temples-in-state/articleshow/88655025.cms||---

As many as 9,500 individuals including 900 medical students of Chamarajanagar Institute of Medical Sciences have registered for eye donation. Inspired by actor Puneeth Rajkumar, who was a native of Gajanur in the district, the district administration had launched the eye donation following his death two months back. The district administration launched the drive along with the district chapter of Indian Red Cross Society and Chamarajanagar Institute of Medical Sciences (CIMS). Of the 9,500 who have registered to donate their eyes, half were college students including 900 medical students of CIMS. Puneeth’s example inspired many people to register and donate their eyes, said sources. A large number of youths from towns like Kollegal and Yelandur have also registered for eye donation. Indian Red Cross Society district unit secretary Dr Mahesh, who is also working at CIMS, said they are not only receiving good response for eye donation registration but also receiving enquiries for donating eyes after people’s death. The willingness among families to donate a relative’s eyes has also increased, he said. “In the last two months, the society was able to retrieve the eyes of two donors and sent to the JSS Eye Bank of Mysuru. But it could not retrieve the eyes of two other donors as a proper system to remove eyes is not available in CIMS. As there is no eye bank eye hospital in the district, the society must seek the help of JSS Hospital of Mysore or the government-run KR Hospital in Mysuru for removal of eyes of donors,” he said. CIMS dean and director Dr Sanjiv told TOI that pledges for donating eyes started picking up in the district in the last two months with an increase of 80 to 90%. Anyone above 18, even those with diabetes, hypertension, heart and kidney ailments, can pledge and donate eyes, he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/over-900-medical-students-pledge-eyes-in-cnagar/articleshow/88655026.cms||---

Continuing his attack on the JD(S) top brass, Lakshmana, who interacted with representatives of the media in Mysuru, called on Kumaraswamy to furnish details of reservoirs constructed in Karnataka either during his stint as CM or his father, HD Deve Gowda’s tenure. “We would also like incumbent irrigation minister Govind Karjol to point to any lake that has come into being because of his efforts till date,” the Congress spokesman said.Of the 26 reservoirs across the state, 21 were constructed under governments headed by the Congress. “The Krishnaraja Sagar Dam was commissioned by Mysuru maharaja Nalwadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar, while the remaining four reservoirs were constructed by the British. The JD(S) and BJP have contributed nothing to the irrigation sector,” said Lakshmana, questioning Kumaraswamy’s remarks against the Congress each time the latter criticised the BJP’s policies. Lakshmana said that the Siddaramaiah-led government had prepared a detailed project report (DPR) in 2013. “The cost of the Mekedatu drinking water project was estimated to cost Rs 5,387 crore. The report had even been submitted to the central government for approval, but was rejected. The second proposal, wherein the cost of the project was increased to Rs 9,500 crore, was also rejected. The BJP-led government has increased the cost of the project to Rs 10,500 crore. If implemented, the project will benefit more than two crore people,” Lakshmana said.Weighing in on the controversy surrounding director of Rangayana, Cariappa, Lakshmana urged the government to suspend him, pointing out that his activities had disturbed peace in Mysuru city.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/hdk-attacking-cong-at-instance-of-bjp/articleshow/88655028.cms||---

Radha never did it, instead, he made open statements before the press. Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy took the issue seriously and provided security, but he sent the gunmen back,” Vellampalli said.“Radha Krishna’s house is located on a main road and many vehicles pass through it. Moving on the road doesn’t mean they are doing recce for murder. We strongly condemn such allegation,” endowments minister said.

Sales of vegetables have also increased in rythu bazaars. The cost of vegetables increased rapidly with incessant rains in November 2021. Tomato crop on thousands of acres were damaged by a cyclonic storm in Chittoor district. Severe shortage sent tomato prices northward to touch the 125 per kilogram mark. Later in the first week of December, traders started importing tomatoes from Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Jharkhand and Telangana, at prices ranging between 65 to 70 per kilogram. Input of tomatoes from Madanapalle once again picked up pace and the cost of tomatoes fell to 42 per kilogram at wholesale markets. The cost of okra, ridge gourd and other vegetables have also come down by 40%. “The price of vegetables usually registers a sudden fall in winter. But a shortage of vegetables resulted in price hike and customers cut down on their shopping lists. The market is recovering slowly and we are expecting sales to boost during Sankranti season,” said M Ragunath Reddy, a wholesale trader from Kaleswara Rao market. Rajiv Gandhi wholesale market and Patamata rythu bazaar were flooded with consumers on Sunday and sellers arranging queues following Covid-19 guidelines. Meanwhile, the demand for chicken skyrocketed during New Year.

A mobile clip of the tigress chasing the gypsies reportedly recorded by a nature guide has gone viral on social media. The big cat can be seen moving close to the Gypsies on the track at a tri-junction before chasing them. Though she did not attack people on board the vehicles, there was a moment of panic among them. “Both the drivers reversed after seeing the charging tigress. Fortunately, as there were no other vehicles on both the tracks, they could reverse in speed,” said a forest official. He said, “As a precautionary measure, the route has been closed for tourists again till further orders. We have also installed cameras at many places in the zone for continuous monitoring of the tigress.” Experts claim chasing vehicles could be a part of the natural instinct of the tigress, but it has never attacked any human till date. Dharmendra Khandal, conservation biologist of Tiger Watch said, “The tigress lives in Zone-1 and its movement is recorded near the human settlements including Ganesh Temple road and Jhoomar Baori. It has never charged at anyone. Some big cats do chase vehicles. Earlier, when tourist activities were less at Ranthambore, there was a tigress named Nasty, which regularly charged vehicles.” This is the third time Sultana has reportedly charged a vehicle. On November 25, a forest staff had a close shave during patrolling when she chased his motorcycle in Zone-1. In a video that went viral in 2019, Sultana came dangerously close to tourists before sprinting alongside their vehicle. The 26-second clip was purportedly shot by tourists.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/sultana-chases-safari-vehicles-in-ranthambore/articleshow/88655039.cms||---

Covid guidelines issued by the home department said the order is applicable for both government and private schools within the limits of Jaipur Municipal Corporation (Greater/Heritage).The government’s move comes on a day the city reported 224 fresh infections, which took the active cases count past the 1,000 mark.“Schools are advised not to force students from classes 9-12 to attend offline classes. They are advised to run online classes as per their schedule,” said Kana Ram, director, secondary education, Bikaner. In other districts, the district collectors, district magistrates and local education officials have been directed to hold discussions with the government before taking any call on schools and colleges. Considering the risks associated with mass gathering of people in marriages, the state has re-imposed the limit of allowing a maximum of 100 persons. The only relief is that the figure excludes band players and cooks. It will be applicable from January 7.Marriage parties have to inform the details of the wedding on covidinfo.rajasthan.gov.in or dial 181. “Since Covid protocols are barely followed in marriages, sub divisional officers (SDOs) have been assigned the task of monitoring the protocols,” said an official. The airport Covid team has been directed to compulsory check the RT-PCR test reports of international passengers. Until the RT-PCR test report comes negative, a passenger will have to stay at home or be under institutional quarantine. Similarly for domestic passengers, it is compulsory to show their double vaccinated certificate and RT-PCR negative report 72 hours prior to arrival at the airport.“In case passengers fail to show the double vaccinated certificate and the RT-PCR negative report, he/she has to undergo the instant RT-PCR test,” reads the report.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/stricter-curbs-in-city-as-cases-surge/articleshow/88655043.cms||---

The urban housing department had earlier proposed to construct nearly 23,000 houses for economic weaker section (EWS) and lower income group (LIG) across the state under public-private and partnership (PPP) model. However, the construction work was stalled after only 10-15% allottees managed to deposit the instalments. An official said, "The department will take loan of Rs 200 crore to complete these projects. While Rs 160 crore will be spent to construct the pending 19,244 houses under Jan Awas Yojana, Rs 40 crore will be spent for constructing 4,112 affordable houses". Earlier, to achieve the target of the ambitious scheme, the state government had provided major relaxations to developers in the state. The government had relaxed the conversion of land policy for developers constructing houses for economic weaker section (EWS) and lower income group (LIG) under the Mukhyamantri Jan Awas Yojana. However, nothing can give the project a momentum during the pandemic. An official source said, "Private parties developing residential projects on their own land have to reserve 10% of the saleable area in proposed colonies and 7.5% floor area ratio in apartments for EWS and LIG categories. However, if the plotted development is less than 2 hectares and less than 5,000sq m (flat development), the developers have the option of paying charges". For plotted development, developers can deposit 10% cost of the saleable area land. This cost is levied as per the reserve price or district lease committee (DLC) rates. Similarly, the department charges Rs 100 per sq ft for 7.5% of the floor area ratio (FAR) for flat development.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/govt-to-take-200cr-loan-from-centre-to-build-houses-for-poor/articleshow/88655045.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan pomegranate farmers suffer losses due to high national supply||JAIPUR: High pomegranate supply in the country has led to losses for the farmers in the state as they struggle to sell their yield. Despite good production, the farmers are in a fix as they are not getting buyers for their pomegranates, which is also comparatively smaller in size. Earlier pomegranate was sold for Rs 70 to 100 per kg in the mandi but now state farmers are getting only Rs 15 to Rs 50 per kg in the wholesale market. The drastic difference in prices is leading to severe losses for the farmers. Rajendra Narang, president of Muhana Mandi Fruit Vendors Association, said that it is a blessing that the Maharashtra pomegranate is not in the market or else most of the produce from the state would have gone to trash. “This year, due to bumper production in other states and Rajasthan, our sale has been affected. We are not getting desired buyers. Also this year’s produce is smaller in size, which has added to our woes. As better quality and big size pomegranates can be bought from other markets, the farmers in Rajasthan fail to get their desired price,” said Narang. Another reason is said to be the winter rains, which has slowed down the sale of all juicy fruits. Pomegranate juice is in demand but due to winter and small size, that part of the market is also very slow. Hastimal Rajpurohit, a farmer from Barmer, has been calling up traders desperately to sell off his pomegranate produce but couldn’t find anyone offering a reasonable price. He is amongst thousands of pomegranates farmers in Rajasthan who are not getting good prices in the market due to high production in the country. “I am not sure if I will be able to sell my production this year. This year has been really difficult as no one is ready to pay the price. Our produce is hardly getting Rs 30 per kg,” said Hastimal. A farmer in Padru village had to face severe loss as due to lack of buyers, his 40,000 kg of pomegranates rotted on the trees. More than 10,000 farmers in Barmer, Sirohi, Jaisalmer, Jalore, Pali are impacted by this crisis.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/raj-pomegranate-farmers-suffer-losses-due-to-high-national-supply/articleshow/88655049.cms||---

Recently, there was no room vacant in Jaisalmer hotels due to Christmas and new year after the heavy inflow of tourists. But, now due to the increasing cases in many states, cancellations have begun. Enquiries for tourist bookings have almost stopped. Around 15-20% bookings have been cancelled. Till a day back, all the rooms in hotels and tent resorts were full in Jaisalmer. Hotel tent resorts were full till January 4-5 but increasing cases of omicron variant and binding by the state government have started affecting the tourism business. Tourists in many budget class hotels and tent resorts have started cancelling their bookings which has worried hoteliers, tourism businessmen, guides, Langa Manganiyars and camel riders. Around two years ago, there was heavy tourist flow in this season. Mayank Bhatia, a hotelier, said, "due to increasing cases of omicron variant in many states including Rajasthan there is a situation of fear in tourists and many cancellations have been done. In the last two days, no new booking enquiries have been received. If this situation continues, then once again the industry could suffer a big economic loss". A three-star hotel's general manager Shashi Kumar said that booking cancellations have started due to a new variant of virus whereas there was a possibility of good tourist inflow in the month of January but now it looks difficult. In the last two days, enquiries regarding bookings have stopped and this could be a danger bell. Many people associated with the tourism business could suffer economic loss. A leading tourist guide Arun Purohit said that in the last two months there was a good inflow of tourists but now hotel bookings are getting cancelled and it will cause heavy loss.

Tomatoes, coriander, lady finger and cucumber farms in Dudu, Bassi, Chaksu and Chomu have been hit hard. “As the crops in Dudu, Bassi, Chaksu, Chomu, Tonk were damaged due to the ground frost and abrupt weather conditions, prices of tomatoes increased in the wholesale market. Hence, it is available in the retail market for Rs 35-45 per kg,” said Abdul Sagir, a wholesale trader at the Muhana Mandi. Till mid-December the prices of tomatoes were Rs 60-80 per kg. But after the arrival of the local harvest the prices dipped and tomatoes were available for Rs 25-30 per kg. Due to the ground frost and abrupt weather conditions the prices of other vegetables including coriander, green chilli, brinjal and cauliflower have also gone up. Navratan Sharma, a farmer of Kacholiya said, “From December 20-26 due to ground frost and rainfall, vegetable crops were damaged in the state. However, we are expecting good vegetables in the second lot of the winter season. Hopefully the prices will drop. On Sunday prices of a few vegetables were less at the Bassi Mandi.” Yet, traders at the Muhana Mandi on Sunday stated that from Tuesday onwards there will be a dip in the prices of daily vegetables. “It was a temporary phase as the prices will start dipping from Tuesday onwards as from Monday the vegetable supply will increase at the Muhana Mandi. The customers will benefit with the drop in prices,” said Shiv Shankar Sharma, a wholesale trader at the Muhana Mandi. Usually, in January and February, good vegetable produce comes from the local farms. “Despite a disappointing start, it appears that in the next couple of days, prices will be favourable. The prices of every vegetable will reduce as Muhana Mandi on Sunday too witnessed a good number of trucks and vehicles carrying vegetables,” said Anil Mawandia.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/cold-wave-leads-to-mild-rise-in-vegetable-prices/articleshow/88655056.cms||---

But, it does not mean that people lower their guards and avoid Covid-appropriate behaviour. Amid rising cases, the state government is imposing restrictions and those not wearing masks and flouting night curfew and other restrictions, may invite action. The city breached 1,000 active cases for the first time since June. Though the city is witnessing a jump in daily infections, city hospitals are not witnessing hospitalisation as patients are recovering under home isolation. The patients are not showing any requirement for oxygen support as of now, which was most commonly seen during the second wave. Not only in RUHS Hospital, but other facilities including private ones are not witnessing hospitalisation of Covid patients in proportion to the number of patients getting tested positive. One of the biggest private hospitals official told TOI that not a single case of Covid was admitted to the hospital. CM Ashok Gehlot praised doctors posted at RUHS Hospital saying that while providing treatment to Covid-19 patients, the doctors visited ICUs even at 2am, 3am for monitoring of the patients on ventilators. Gehlot said it while holding a meeting with all party leaders, religious leaders and NGOs on Sunday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/active-cases-cross-1k-mark-in-city-but-majority-recovering-at-home/articleshow/88655057.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Cases of runaway kids soar, says railway child help desk||JAIPUR: The help desks for children have been working during the pandemic to deal with issues faced by the minors. Jaipur railway child help desk officials claimed that while the number of cases have reduced compared to previous years, they are getting higher number of runaway cases. According to officials, while there were around 350 cases of child trafficking, child labour and runaways in 2019-20, they reduced to approximately 185 cases between April to December 2021. Most of the runaways are between the age group of 12 to 16 years. Anup Yadav, coordinator, Jaipur railway child help desk, told TOI, “The number of cases has reduced because of the lockdown as no trains were plying. Preferred mode of transport for child labour and trafficking was railways, especially trains coming from Bihar. However, we found that after the trains started plying again, majority of cases were of runaway children as opposed to the previous years. Year 2020 was an exception as we had only 92 cases but that was essentially due to the pandemic". Recently, three cases of runaways in Pali were brought before the local child welfare committee (CWC) in which the children ran away from home after being chided for spending too much time using mobile phones and being on social media. Out of these cases, one child actually ran away from home in Gujarat’s Vapi and reached Pali. Elaborating on this recent trend, Sitaram Sharma, chairperson, Pali CWC, said, "this is fairly a new trend and in past two months we had 3-4 cases where the children ran away because of trivial reasons like being asked not to use the mobile phone. In majority of the cases, the children are teenagers and parents have told us that their child’s behaviour had changed due to extensive mobile use". The field workers lamented that while mobile phone use has increased during the pandemic, parents also will have to tell their children about the pros and cons of the same. "We have also appealed to the parents that they should talk to their children about the good and bad aspects of technology. We cannot run away from the fact that technology has become a part of our lives and at times when parents are very strict then children also react. When such cases come to us, we counsel both of them," added Sharma.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/cases-of-runaway-kids-soar-says-railway-child-help-desk/articleshow/88655059.cms||Yeshika Budhwar

On Sunday, more than hundred PWD contract workers from Bicholim, under the banner Labour Supply Society, gathered at the office of the workers’ legal advisor, advocate Ajay Prabhugaonkar, at Bicholim and requested him to submit a memorandum to the state government on their behalf. They said that about 465 workers are working on contract basis for PWD offices in Bicholim taluka from the last nine to 15 years, but as of today, they have not been alloted TS, which is mandatory after completion of 8 years of work. The workers also said that they are getting a meager salary of Rs 10,000/month, which is not enough for sustenance of their families. They further said that the government has recently recruited 270 contract workers through the recruitment process and hence they be given justice at the earliest.

Delta Corp Ltd aimed at setting up an integrated resort development over 3 lakh sqm. The project includes three hotels, a convention centre, a multiplex cinema, a retail area, a water park, banquet facilities and a children’s entertainment area. The cabinet decided to defer the decision after Ajgaonkar objected to it. “I have objected to the proposal as no one was taken into confidence in the constituency, including the panchayat,” the deputy CM said. The Goa Investment Promotion and Facilitation Board had received an application in December 2019 from Delta Corp Ltd for setting up an integrated resort development at Dhargalim in Pernem and to recommend to the government to demarcate and notify the reference area as an investment promotion area. The board, in a meeting held on October 26, 2020, has granted an in-principle approval to the aforesaid project. In a meeting held on September 1, 2021, the board recommended the reference area of the project, measuring 3.8 lakh sqm to be declared as investment promotion area (IPA). Under the provisions of sub-section (2) of Section 42 of the Goa Investment Promotion and Facilitation of Single Window Clearance Act, 2021 (Goa Act 19 of 2021), the government issued a proclamation in respect of Delta Corp Ltd for the said project. The proclamation was published in the state government’s official gazette dated November 25, 2021. The government also gave a one month time period, from the date of publication of the proclamation, for objections to the said proposal to be submitted in writing, with reasons, to the director of industries, trade and commerce (DITC). On December 15, 2021, DITC received an objection from a group under the banner of Calangute Constituency Forum. It mentioned that the in-principle approval for the said project granted by the Goa-IPB is not in the interest of the Pernem people, especially the people of Dhargal village, and also the state at large. DITC had highlighted that since the complainant is not from the taluka/panchayat where the project falls in, the contention of the complaint was devoid of any merit.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/govt-defers-nod-to-delta-corp-for-electronic-casino-at-pernem/articleshow/88675110.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Row over construction of cricket pitch on waqf land||JAIPUR: Civil society groups have opened a front against cabinet minister Mahesh Joshi alleging his role behind the ‘illegal’ construction of a cricket pitch on Karbala Maidan at Jal Mahal for a tournament organised by his close aides. The ground is listed as a property of Rajasthan Board of Muslim Waqfs (RBMW), a body that comes under the department of minorities. The RBMW has denied giving permission to construct a cricket pitch for a tournament and demanded its removal and police action against encroachers. The ground comes under Hawa Mahal constituency and Joshi is a local MLA. The incident come to light on Thursday when the locals saw the construction on the ground. Initially, they thought it was being done by the board. Later, when they could see that a cricket pitch was taking shape, they objected and informed the RBMW office. The posters and banners of the tournament have pictures of Joshi and his son Rohit further angered the locals. TOI called up Mahesh Joshi and Rohit for comments but got no response. Since then locals have been protesting against the alleged illegal construction claiming that ground is only used for religious functions. Mujahid Naqvi, the spokesperson of Milli Council Rajasthan, has accused Joshi of using his influence to encroach Waqf board land. “I am shocked that such a bizarre incident has happened right under the nose of our local MLA Joshi. His role in the illegal construction cannot be denied,” said Naqvi. Aqueel Khan, chief executive officer (CEO), RBMW, said he had sent a letter to the district collector and the deputy commissioner of police, Jaipur South, to remove it. “As per the rules, pukka construction is not allowed until permitted by the RBMW board. The construction has violated the norms of the waqf Act,” said Khan. The rising protest has forced the organisers to contact the secretary of the minorities department, Purna Chandra Kishen, for help. “Rohit Joshi (son of Mahesh Joshi) came with organisers and informed that every year, except 2021, matches took place at the ground. The organisers are ready to remove the pitch at their own expense after the tournament. The message has been communicated to the RBMW office,” said Kishen. In response to Kishen’smessage, Khan said, “The CEO doesn’t have the powers to grant permission for construction. It is the sole right of the board which is yet to be constituted.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/row-over-construction-of-cricket-pitch-on-waqf-land/articleshow/88655062.cms||---

A team of medical officers went to check them on Sunday morning and prescribed medicines. According to the residents, since last few days, Ganesh Nagar, Phutleya Baad, Govindpuri, Jamna Devi, Gayatri Nagar, and Kumawat colony, have been getting polluted water from the pipeline of the Public Health and Engineering Department’s (PHED). Pradeep Joshi, a resident of one of the colonies said that they get water supply twice a day. “The morning water supply is clean but, in the evening, we have been receiving dirty yellow water, which has an unbearable odour. Although we didn’t drink that water, it went into the underground water tanks in the houses which impacted our health,” said Joshi. However, surprisingly, PHED officials claimed that no water was supplied to the complaining colonies in the evening. Mangturam Jain, assistant engineer at PHED in Sodala said that they have checked the entire area but couldn’t find any leakage in their pipeline. “PHED supplies water in these areas only in the morning. We are yet to find out how they are being supplied water and moreover polluted water. We are keeping an eye on the situation,” said Jain. Residents of the colony claimed that they were advised by the PHED officials not to consume water supplied in the evening. “Today we received clean coloured water but the foul smell persisted. No satisfactory action has been taken yet. Still water supplied in the evening gets mixed in our water tanks,” said Joshi.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/drinking-polluted-water-makes-sodala-residents-ill/articleshow/88655063.cms||---

The Protestant church was established by the Britishers when Bandikui was an important railway junction. More than 60 British Christians and Anglo-Indian families (mostly railway employees) used to reside near the church. However, after independence, most of these families shifted to other places in search of better opportunities. Currently, only one Protestant family resides in the vicinity of the church that was last operational in 2013. Sandeep Edwin, president of the Rajasthan Christian Youth Association, said he had been fighting for the restoration of the Church for a long time. "In 2013, prayers were held in the church for the last time. As a community, we have no one left there to look after it. The government has sanctioned funds for the restoration of many heritage sites. It should look into the Christian heritage of the state too," said Edwin. The condition of the abandoned church continues to deteriorate by the day. The church bell was stolen a few years ago along with doors and windows. The stained glasses with mother marry and Jesus’s portraits painted were broken along with the white marble Baptism pond. The wooden benches and other furniture were stolen leaving an empty hall that has now become a gathering point for miscreants. Secretary of the Diocese of Rajasthan, Church of North India, Rakesh Samual, said they had met politicians but no strong step was taken to preserve the church. "We met politicians too. As a small community, we are not in inadequate numbers to restore the church and to maintain it for years after that," said Samual. The deputy director of the archaeology department, Krishnakanta Sharma, said if the building is more than 100-years-old, we will look into its historical importance and send a proposal to the Jaipur circle superintendent. Many Anglo-Indian families, that have lived in Bandikui, have written about the beautiful times they had spent during Christmas. One online blog has mentioned that Christmas used to be a month-long celebration for the Protestants.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/govt-fund-sought-for-restoration-of-140-yr-old-church-in-bandikui/articleshow/88655066.cms||Parul Kulshrestha

Till now, the state has managed its fight against the coronavirus excellently with cooperation from all quarters, and all possible steps will be taken to protect against the disease, he said. Gehlot was interacting with religious leaders, public representatives, political leaders, social activists and NGOs via video-conferencing from his official residence. The whole world faced a horrific situation due to the Delta variant of the virus during the second wave, he said, adding people had to deal with shortage of oxygen, hospital beds and life-saving medicines. Even at this adverse time, Rajasthan saved many lives. Medicines were flown in, and the situation was monitored at a high-level, he said. In the last few days, the Omicron variant has spread in more than 125 countries, and as per experts, this variant is highly transmissible, Gehlot said, adding that people will have to be very careful and cautious. Medical Minister Parsadi Lal Meena said Rajasthan has suggested to the Centre to expand the vaccination drive for teenagers in the 15-18 age group to include those above 12 so that the maximum number of children can be protected.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/gehlot-calls-for-vigilance-to-protect-against-covid/articleshow/88655068.cms||---

Also, police are identifying the areas where the cases are rampant."Firstly, we are in touch with the Telengana police, who have a portal in which we mutually share the information on the conmen. We upload and share the mobile numbers used in cheating and also the IMEI numbers of various mobile phones. This enables other states to access the database if needed. Thus, in case of a big cheating case, it can facilitate not only us but also other states during investigation," said Tejaswini Gautam, Alwar SP.She added police are aiming to ensure if a conman gets arrested in a case in Alwar or Bharatpur and manages to get bail, he can get re-arrested in his other cheating acts in other states. "If they will continue to get booked repeatedly, they will not find time to repeat such crimes," the SP added.Meanwhile, Bharatpur SP Devendra Bishnoi said police have identified the pockets and areas where the cases are rampant."In these areas, we will organise awareness camps where we will associate with the family of the conmen to give them a loud and clear message that they can’t get away with this crime easily," Bishnoi added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/mewat-cops-share-database-of-conmen-with-other-states-to-solve-crime-faster/articleshow/88655070.cms||---

However, their arrival was delayed by a month this year as they are usually here in November. Wetlands in Bardha Dam have been a favourite with the Pelicans for decades but this year they have been seen in wetlands of Ramnagar pond of the district. This is also because fishery contractors’ employees at Bardha Dam drive away the winged visitors away fire crackers. The fishery contracts for the dams pose a threat to the existence of Pelican and other migratory birds that stay here for around four months, said wildlife activist and former honorary wildlife warden, Prithvi Singh Rajawat. With snowfall in middle Asia, Pelicans that weigh around 9 to 15 kilograms live on fish and consume 5-7 kg per day. They fly around 3,000kms to reach here for safe winter stay and breeding, said Rajawat. He said the state government should keep a dam free from fishery contract in every district so that winged visitors can have a safe stay. The provisions of Wetland Act should be effectively implemented, and agriculture and non-forest activities should be banned in ponds and wetlands, he said. There are eight species of Pelicans and of them Rosy Pelican or White Pelican and Dalmatian Pelican, the largest member of Pelican family arrive every year in southern and eastern parts of Rajasthan. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/winged-visitors-throng-wetlands-in-bundi-dist/articleshow/88655077.cms||---
---||Mangaluru||Omicron threat: Students forced to fly abroad early||MANGALURU: The Omicron threat is forcing students studying abroad to fly there in advance, to ensure that they don’t get stranded, in case flights get cancelled, or there is an increase in fares. For instance, Ashwil Melita Veigas, a resident of Bajal, has travelled back to Australia almost two months in advance. A cyber security student at Deakin University, Australia, she said, “My course commences on March 1. With Covid cases rising, I fear that the borders could be sealed again. The moment bookings opened, I booked my ticket and landed here on December 20. I have been planning my higher studies for the past four years, and did not want Covid-19 to ruin it,” Ashwil told TOI. Seetaram, a resident of Bengaluru, who has secured admission in Brunel University London, UK for an MSc in engineering management, has travelled a month in advance. He said that generally students studying abroad fly a week or two in advance, before the course commences. “Since my study visa started a month before the start of my programme, I decided to get there earlier. This was because I saw that the air fares were getting more expensive, and the fear of rising cases of the Omicron variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. I have been recommending the same to my friends. Reaching here early also helps you settle down at ease, before classes commence,” said Seetaram, whose classes begin in the first week of January. Akshay Chaturvedi, founder and CEO, Leverage Edu, an education company, said that there is absolutely no reason for panic. “Countries like the UK, US, Canada and others are better prepared to welcome fully vaccinated students. Moreover, it is important for foreign universities to keep an open line of communication with students,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/omicron-threat-students-forced-to-fly-abroad-early/articleshow/88655079.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

He said the city police launched an extensive probe into the issue and are verifying details from various angles. In the meantime, we have also taken all measures to ensure safety and security of Radha Krishna, he said. Kanti Rana added various state-level agencies were also involved in the investigation along with the city police. The issue is being seriously looked into and the allegations that the police are not doing enough is far from truth, he noted. Referring to the allegations made by TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu that why police are not registering a zero FIR based on his letter to DGP, Kanti Rana said legally it is not possible to register a zero FIR in the absence of a cognizable crime. Reassuring the safety and security of Radha Krishna, the city police boss appealed to not spread any rumours on the issue which could vitiate peace and tranquillity in the city. “We are also in touch with Radha Krishna and have explained to him the security measures taken by the city police.

He said that the Delhi government was fully prepared for any situation but, currently, only a fraction of beds available for Covid-19 patients was occupied. “Covid is on the rise in Delhi, the numbers are seeing a jump day by day. However, I want to reiterate that the situation is not worthy of panic and, thus, I am presenting data to support it,” Kejriwal said during a digital press briefing. “There’s no need to worry, but we need to be completely cautious about the virus,” he added. Kejriwal said that on December 29, 2021, Delhi recorded 923 cases; the number went up to 1,313 on December 30; and 1,796 on December 31. Then, 2,796 new cases were recorded on January 1, 2022. He said there were 6,360 active cases in Delhi (till Saturday), while the number was 2,191 on December 29. “Roughly, there has been a rise of approximately 4,000 active cases in three days. But, while 262 hospital beds were occupied by Covid patients on December 29, the number dropped to 247 on January 1,” he said, adding that this meant that the Covid-positive patients now had very mild symptoms and didn’t need to go to hospitals. “As of today, only 82 oxygen beds are occupied in Delhi and this number has remained stable for days. Barely anyone coming to the hospital requires oxygen even when there are 6,000 active cases,” he said. Kejriwal , however, also said that the Delhi government was preparing 37,000 oxygenated beds “to be ahead of the virus at all times”. “At present, there are about 6,300 active cases. On March 27, there were about 6,600. But back then, 1,150 oxygen beds were occupied while today only 82 are taken. About 145 patients were on ventilators, today only five are,” he said -2021. “I just want to tell the people of Delhi that there is no need to panic at all,” he said. “We all have to be completely responsible; we must wear masks in public, follow social distancing and wash hands with soap. The variant is very mild and your government will always stand with you,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/dont-panic-just-0-2-of-beds-taken-cm/articleshow/88653470.cms||---

Therefore, most of the farmers have refrained from registering their vineyards for the export considering that they will not get adequate rates from the traders due to the rise in freight and other charges.This resulted in a poor response from the grape farmers initially. But some farmers, who had decided not to register their vineyards earlier, did register after the extension of the deadline to December 31, 2021.The Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development authority has made registration of vineyards mandatory for the grape-growers since 2004 to promote export quality grapes production.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/7381-more-farmers-register-vineyards-for-grape-export/articleshow/88655090.cms||---

The passengers with confirmed tickets, who were travelling with their family members, were being forced to free up some space on a three-seater berth for the children, women, senior citizens. Shubhangi Bendale, a 48-year-old woman, who was travelling with four family members to Shegaon on Friday, was forced to share her seat with people who had barged into her coach. The incident occurred at 9 pm as a result of which, there was an altercation between the family members and the people travelling without reservations. “It was horrible and the people threatened me and my family members. I contacted the Railway Protection Force through social media and they reached the coach within 10 minutes. They finally deboarded those people, which was a major relief to the passengers,” Bendale said. The people seated in the gangway did not give an easy way to the families who boarded the train at Nashik and it took them at least 20 minutes to reach their seats and then another 20 minutes to ask the people to vacate the seats. Similar was the case with Nashik-based Sandesh Raut and his wife travelling from Manmad to Aurangabad on Saturday. “The people were not listening to any of the passengers with confirmed tickets despite the fact that people with current bookings were allowed only in select trains, and questioned how did these people manage to enter the platforms amid restrictions." The railway authorities from the Bhusawal division said that they received a large number of complaints via the dedicated number 182. Due to this, the staff had been deployed in the long-distance trains to ensure that genuine travellers got all the help from the department. “A few trains were cancelled during the weekend, which resulted in people who were desperate to travel getting inside the train without tickets. Such people are being caught and penalized,” the officer added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/train-tourists-without-reservation-irk-passengers/articleshow/88655093.cms||---

President of Allahabad Chemist & Druggist Anil Dubey admitted to TOI that that prices of the life saving drugs including anti biotics and anti- inflammatory drugs has increased around 40 percent in past four months.

He explained that the government has successfully overcome the Covid-19-induced financial crisis with its effective management. He added the state is progressing towards achieving double-digit growth post-Covid-19 recovery. The minister lashed out at the Opposition TDP and its ‘allied’ media houses for spreading false campaign with regard to the debts of the state.  In a statement issued on Sunday, Buggana said the TDP leaders were deliberately spreading lies despite Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) confirming that revenue deficit is slowly coming down to the permissible levels. He said the state government had in fact managed to ensure that per capita income do not go down even during the pandemic with aggressive implementation of the welfare schemes. “State’s revenue deficit and fiscal deficit were relatively better than the country’s numbers,” Buggana said. He said the GSDP in 2020-21 fiscal was badly hit only due to the Covid-19. “Despite having positive trend without any impact of pandemic, the state’s GSDP was dipped to 4.88 per cent during 2018-19 from the previous 10.09 per cent during the TDP regime. This is lowest growth rate reported by other key states in the country,” said Buggana. He added the GSDP shot up to 7.23 per cent in 2019-20 under the able leadership of YS Jagan Mohan Reddy. The GSDP in 2020-21 was however impacted due to the Covid-19 outbreak and dipped to 2.58 per cent. “This is much better performance than the bigger states .”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/revenues-in-fine-fettle-double-digit-growth-target-min/articleshow/88652985.cms||Samdani MN

Also, in probably first-of-its-kind decision taken by an educational institute, the university has decided to blacklist former auditor - chartered accountant (CA) K G Patel & Company, Anand - in connection to the financial irregularities to the tune of Rs 37.30 crore. The university’s syndicate members took the decision recently based on a report submitted by a five-member committee headed by retired judge of Gujarat high court Dhiren Karia. The forensic audit assignment was carried out on honorary basis by Shah Sanjeev & Associates, chartered accountant and certified fraud examiner from Vadodara. TOI had earlier reported that the probe panel had held former CAO and former auditor responsible for gross negligence in discharge of their duties. “We have also decided to write a letter to the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, the apex accountancy body, regarding the irregularity carried out by the former CA recommending action from the institute,” said SPU vice-chancellor professor Shirish Kulkarni, who had constituted an inquiry based on a demand raised by syndicate members. While Bhatt, whose suspension order will be issued on Monday will face departmental inquiry, the university has also decided to constitute inquiry against its former officiating registrar Dr Mohan Patel, currently principal of N S Patel Arts College. “The accounts of financial year 2014-15 were signed by him as registrar of the university,” said Kulkarni. The probe report has ruled out financial fraud or scam but has pointed out accounting mismatch. The books of accounts of any organisation tallies with its audited financial statements. At SPU, the books of accounts were not tallying with the audited financial statements. In financial year 2014-15, there were two separate debit entries in ledger accounts amounting to Rs 29.22 crore and Rs 8.08 crore. These adjustment entries were passed in the accounts. This was passed to match audited statements with books of accounts. During the forensic audit, 5,496 ledger accounts of financial year 2014-15 were scrutinised. Of this adjustment entries were found in 1,649 ledger accounts.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/spu-suspends-former-cao-in-a-first-blacklists-audit-firm/articleshow/88653548.cms||Prashant Rupera

These are vehicle owners who have made the full payment and the number plates are ready,” a transport officer told TOI. “A check is required on the number of bookings and the number of installations. Once the ones that have missed or skipped installation are pulled up, they should fall in line and complete the process,” the officer said. Currently, only new vehicle owners have been able to get vehicles pre-installed with HSRPs directly from the respective car dealerships. Vehicles that were purchased prior to the law coming into force were therefore mandated to install the unique number plate. While the installation process started full swing two years ago, the pandemic-induced lockdowns and restrictions since then have limited the number of installations per day. Cases of Covid-19 infections among the HSRP fitting centre staff also temporarily forced operations to shut at a few locations, only to resume later. These gaps, however, resulted in a gradual decrease in the overall footfalls at the centres even after restrictions were lifted. “Complete implementation may take some time. There are some vehicle owners that are living overseas while many others have yet to come forward to even make the booking for HSRPs,” the officer said, adding that the special drive will help give momentum to the initiative.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/drive-to-install-high-security-plates-on-vehicles-resumes/articleshow/88654336.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: 600 private buses on road to boost public transport||NEW DELHI: Commuters are likely to get some relief from Monday with more private buses hitting the roads as part of the extended ‘Paryavaran Bus Service’, originally started to augment public transport as Delhi faced an air emergency in November 2021. With the Level 1 (Yellow) of the Graded Action Response Plan (GRAP) in place, only 50% seating is allowed in public transport buses and standing passengers are not permitted. While the existing fleet of buses in the capital already finds it difficult to accommodate the growing demand, the major dip in the carrying capacity has made it tougher for commuters to find a bus. “The buses engaged under the Paryavaran Bus Service, mostly private chartered buses, were provided special permits to pick and drop passengers while plying on routes fixed by the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC). While the permits had expired, these buses have now been re-engaged till January 31 and the special permits have been renewed,” an official said. “More than 600 buses had reported for duty till Sunday morning and more are expected to join in the coming days,” he said. “DTC and Cluster Scheme buses are also being operated in full capacity to meet the demand,” he said. Transport minister Kailash Gahlot had tweeted on Friday that keeping in view the difficulties being faced by the public due to the restrictions, the Delhi government has decided to extend the duration of private buses running under Paryavaran Bus Service till January 31, 2022. “I hope this will help in providing relief to bus commuters in Delhi,” he had tweeted. Passengers have been finding it difficult to board buses, which now have limited carrying capacity. On Thursday, a group of people blocked the MB Road and damaged DTC buses after not being allowed to board buses due to seating restrictions. AC buses in Delhi can seat up to 35 passengers but are able to carry only 17 at time, apart from a bus marshal. Non-AC buses, the fleet size of which is much higher, can seat 41 passengers and can cater to up to 19-20 passengers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/600-pvt-buses-on-road-to-boost-public-transport/articleshow/88653480.cms||Sidharatha Roy

On a pilot basis, Tolankere lake surroundings will be lighted with green energy. CW Shakeel Ahmed, managing director, HDSCL, said, “The required solar energy for operating streetlights is 6.25 KVA. A solar panel with the same capacity will be installed at Tolankere lake area and the power so generated will be used for the operation of streetlights. The solar panels will be designed in the shape of a butterfly, which is the logo of HDSCL. Praveen, electrical engineer of HDSCL, said that there are a total 170 LED lights in and around Tolankere lake, of which around 100 will be connected to solar energy. From 7pm to 10pm solar energy will be used for streetlights, after 10pm for high mast lights. Analysing the feasibility of the pilot project, green energy will be used for other projects too. “With the solar energy we can save around Rs 70,000 per year. The payback period for the investment starts from the 6th year,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/hdscl-to-use-solar-energy-to-power-streetlights-in-twin-cities/articleshow/88655108.cms||J Abbas Mulla

Many of their transfer applications have been awaiting approval for a long time.Data collated by the Karnataka State Government Employees’ Association shows that around 100 teachers were suffering minor to severe diseases, including cancer, heart and kidney ailments. However, the state government is yet to issue a notification owing to the volume of vacancies that are yet to be filled in Kalyana Karnataka.In all, as many as 4,008 teachers in the Kalaburagi division were posted from southern and central districts of Karnataka. Of these, 3,178 have sought a transfer. Many of the teachers have been working in the division for the past 10 to 15 years. Shamala S, who has been working at a school in Ballari for the past 12 years, “I have no problem continuing here but there is the added responsibility of having to take care of my elderly parents,” she said.Raghunath, a high school teacher in Koppal, told TOI, “Many teachers are crying daily to be transferred. Many teachers are away from their spouses for a long time. Teachers are knocking on the doors of the education department regularly seeking a transfer.”Syed Hafizullah, an activist involved in the education sector, said that nearly 25% of the teaching posts in the region was vacant. “When this is the situation, teachers who have sought a transfer will not be getting one. Teachers who have sought a transfer for genuine reasons will not be able to do their jobs well considering the pressure they are under. The state government must take steps to fill the vacant posts and transfer teachers to ensure that children are imparted quality education,” Hafizullah said.An official working with the department of public instruction in the Kalaburagi division said that the government was recruiting more than 4,000 guest teachers to tide over the crisis. “Once the recruitment process is completed, the teachers will be transferred,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/more-than-3k-govt-school-teachers-in-kalyana-ktaka-want-transfer/articleshow/88655110.cms||Shreyas HS

Both are believed to have frozen to death — their bodies are believed to have been lying there for the past few days. It wasn’t clear if they had lost their way and ended up in the meadow where temperatures are sub-zero currently. Police officials said the bodies were identified on the basis of airline tickets found in their pockets. “Prima facie, it appears that they were from Mumbai as they took a flight from there. It is yet to be established how long the bodies were lying there and the relationship between the two,” said Chamoli SP Shweta Choubey. Based on the information available, both boarded a Mumbai-Dehradun flight on December 8 and stayed in Haridwar till December 12 before leaving for Joshimath. “After reaching Joshimath, they checked into a guest house. They travelled to Auli by ropeway the next day and were supposed to return on December 15,” Choubey said. Vinod Rawat, a police official at Chamoli, said, “Ee were unable to contact their families.

Bheemappa told TOI that under Section 372 A of KP Act, flying any flag apart from the national flag is unconstitutional. He submitted the memorandum on this ground, he said.In response to an RTI query on the flag, the Nippani CMC said the corporation started hoisting the flag after this was decided by its members in May 1990 and was there for all these years.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/maratha-flag-at-nippani-cmc-attracts-admin-query/articleshow/88655116.cms||---

People have stopped wearing masks in public places and observe social distance,” said a public health expert. “The Omicron variant of coronavirus is not yet in the community and mostly found in travellers coming from outside India.

The administration will release a draft of the policy in the second week of January, informing people about benefits of purchasing electric vehicles in the long and short term. The policy will contain multiple features to encourage residents to go for the purchase. Sources said besides promoting e-bikes for short distances, some of the key features of the policy will be to give financial incentive on purchase of EVs. The UT is weighing tie-ups with dealers for agreement and free registration. Free parking facilities and exemption from road tax are likely to be the other relaxations. Those going in for electric vehicles in the first year of the launch of the policy will end up saving more money. Multiple meetings and deliberations of a three-member committee comprising chief executive officer of Crest, municipal commissioner and deputy commissioner had taken place to make the policy viable, result-oriented, and interesting. The committee had given many suggestions to the administration in the recent past. “With the city already receiving electric buses recently, the electric vehicle policy 2022 is all set to be launched from the start of the next financial year, April 1. As it will be the first-ever EV policy, the real strength will be to promote EVs and encourage people us them, so that maximum come forward to opt for them instead of fuel-based vehicles,” a senior UT official. “People will also get multiple incentives to shift from fuel vehicles. Good technology-oriented EVs are entering the market. People can choose them with full faith as they have a long life,” the official added. The policy will see making registration of EVs easier and quicker by offering immediate online registration. The registration will be allowed for two, three, and four-wheeler EVs. Besides other issues, reducing pollution in the city is another crucial factor behind bringing the policy.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/with-incentives-galore-city-to-get-its-first-ev-policy-in-april/articleshow/88655120.cms||Deepak Yadav

Ask these 108 emergency services ambulance staffers carrying an injured person in an accident in Amreli on Sunday and being blocked by pride of Asiatic lions on the state highway. It was indeed an intense battle of wits between man vs wild as law prohibits honking at the lions, while life, literally, was slipping away in front of their eyes. The incident took place on Saturday night when 40-year-old Prakash Bariya’s bike rammed into a Nilgai near Vanda village of Savarkundla and he received serious head injury. He was being taken to Amreli Civil Hopsital from Savarkundla to Amreli, when a pride of lions blocked the road of the ambulance which was speeding to save a life. The ambulance staff slowed down the vehicle, while they simultaneously started treating him inside the van to save precious time. Meanwhile, three lions came on the state highway and decided to jay walk in the middle of the road. Now, according to Wildlife Act rules, vehicles have to stop till the time the lions vacate the roads by themselves. This, then proved to be truly critical for the ambulance staff, who knew that every minute counted for the injured person. Emergency medical technician, Jagdish Solanki said, “The lions came on the road when we reached near Gokharvara hotel. They started walking on the road ahead of the vehicle for about a three kilometre stretch. We had no option but to slow down our pace till we turned towards Amreli city by crossing Shetrunji river. We had to respect pride and obey the rules too.” Seeing the extraordinary situation, the emergency staff started treatment of the patient under instructions of doctors over the phone.

Sanghavi, who was in Palitana, was referring to the two cases of women being allegedly lured into marriage by men belonging to a different faith by faking their identities and fake documents reported from the temple town. "There is nothing wrong with falling in love. But conspiring to trap gullible girls by faking identities and making bogus documents cannot be tolerated. Such people will not be spared anywhere in Gujarat,' the minister told reporters.  Sanghavi said the government has taken both (Palitana) cases seriously and the investigations show that there was a conspiracy to deceive the girls.  Four people were recently arrested and three from New Delhi booked after a woman eloped with a man from a different religion and both got married. Investigation had revealed that the accused had prepared fake documents to register their marriage in a Delhi court. "There are certain vidharmi (heretic) people who are running a conspiracy to trap Gujarat's girls. I am warning them to mend their ways as Gujarat police is in no mood to show any leniency and stringent action will be taken against them," he said.  Sanghavi went on to appeal to people to approach the police without fearing social stigma if someone is trying to lure their daughters into such traps. "We will ensure that your identity is not disclosed," he said. Referring to the issue of non-vegetarian food being sold in Palitana, Sanghavi said the vegetarian zone rules will be enforced strictly by the administration. “Palitana is a pious land and we will make all necessary arrangement to maintain it as vegetarian town. It’s not important who eats what, but their food habits should not hurt religious sentiments of people from other faith,” he said. Palitana, pilgrim town of Jains, is India's first fully vegetarian town.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/wont-spare-love-jihadis-warns-guj-hm/articleshow/88655130.cms||---

They carry out surprise attacks on Indian positions along the LoC.On New Year’s Day, Army stakeout along the LoC spotted the terrorist in a Pathani suit and black jacket. Armed with an AK-47 assault rifle, he was trying to break through the anti-infiltration obstacle system across the border.

The systems are to be installed in coastal areas, as per a directive of the high court. However, the question arose about whether in Goa a tower can be erected on sand dunes. An expert member of the GCZMA examined the issue and found that the tower is not being installed over a sand dune and that setting up of such systems was permitted as per CRZ norms. “The CRZ notification at Para 8 (l)(i)(d) permits erection of such structures in CRZ I area which include sand dunes,” the GCZMA noted. As part of the national cyclone risk mitigation project being implemented by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), risk mitigation infrastructure is being created in eight cyclone prone states of the country. The five western coastal states include Goa, Gujarat, Karnataka, Kerala and Maharashtra. Creating EWDS infrastructure is currently under progress in Goa, Karnataka and Kerala. The tropical Indian Ocean has been experiencing a rapid increase in ocean warming, with the strongest warming seen in the Arabian Sea. This has caused the recent increase in frequency of cyclones. However, in recent years, the loss of life during cyclones in the country has been drastically reduced due to infrastructure like EWDS. The EWDS are operated by the State Disaster Management Authority, which uses it to alert people about the impending disaster.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/cyclone-warning-system-at-morjim-gets-coastal-body-nod/articleshow/88654358.cms||---

This is the maximum number of single-day Covid cases detected among the healthcare workers in Bihar so far. These doctors and MBBS students got themselves tested after 17 of their colleagues and batchmates had tested positive a day before.

According to ECR chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar, ‘Kavach’ will b installed first on the Pt Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Junction-Gaya-Dhanbad Grand Chord route. Railways is likely to float a tender to this effect this month and the work on this route will be completed in about six months from now at an estimated cost of Rs160 crore, he said.‘Kavach’ will be on the pattern of European Train Control System (ETCS) to check possible mishaps on tracks during winter or in any other weather conditions. The device is indigenously developed by research designs and standards organisations (RDSO) of railways in Lucknow in collaboration with two other firms, Kumar said.The ‘Kavach’ will be installed inside the cabin of locomotives linking directly through radio system to stations located on the entire route through which passenger trains will pass. This device is being introduced after five years of successful trial in Secunderabad division of the South Central Railway (SCR), the CPRO said.The greatest advantage of the device is that it will display on device monitor system about all aspects of signal condition. ‘Everything will be displayed on the ‘Kavach’ monitor fitted in the locomotive cabin,” he said, adding the device has inbuilt automatic brake system which will check the possibilities of either front or rear collision of the passenger trains through sensor.As compared to the present ‘fog safe device’ (FSD), Kavach is the product of the latest technology equivalent to ETCS level 1. Once installed, railways will bring a revolution in the signalling system in the country. The FSD to some extent has improved traffic operation system in foggy weather conditions. Detention of trains due to dense fog will thus become a passe soon after installation of ‘Kavach’ on fog-prone routes under the ECR, he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/rlys-to-launch-kavach-for-safety-on-tracks/articleshow/88655154.cms||Kumod Verma

Police had been looking for Ayub following the mysterious disappearance of three youths of Siwan in November last year. The STF team has taken Ayub to Siwan on Sunday morning for interrogation in several cases. Three youths — Anshu Singh, Vishal Kumar Singh and Parvendra Yadav — of Siwan mysteriously disappeared in November last year.

A resident of Gyaspur village under the Siwan police station area, Ayub was once a close aide and main shooter of late Mohd Shahabuddin. However, he and his brother rebelled against Shahabuddin and formed their own gang. Police sources said, “Acting on a tip-off that Ayub along with his family members had been to Gangtok to celebrate the New Year and will be returning to Muzaffarpur, the STF team along with Siwan and Baisi police intensified patrolling at Dalkhola checkpost checking the vehicles entering the district from West Bengal. Ayub was thus nabbed with his family near Purnia.” Ayub and his younger brother Rais Khan are the most wanted gangsters of Siwan. They are running the infamous Khan brothers gang and are involved in several land grabbing, extortion, kidnapping and murder cases. Siwan SP Shailesh Kumar Sinha told this newspaper on Sunday that STF sleuths are interrogating Ayub. “The gangster was brought to Siwan on Sunday morning.

With 14 new Covid cases recorded by the health department, the tally of active cases in the city rose to 37. This was a high number of new Covid infections in a day recorded in the past several weeks. The rise in cases indicates the gradual setting in of the third corona wave.

The new cases were reported from IIT, Aramapur, Panki, Kalyanpur, Juhi, Kakadeo, Harjinder Nagar, RK Nagar, Kidwai Nagar, Barra and Harsh Nagar areas of the city. The health department had recorded five Covid cases on Friday and nine cases on Saturday. In spite of surge in cases, people have completely shunned masks and nobody is seen following social distancing norms at public places. The cases are rising despite night curfew because people are moving around freely during day hours without wearing masks. A big crowd of people could be seen at Kanpur Metro stations where there is a craze for taking the first ride in the Metro train. The health department informed that over 3,100 samples were taken for conducting Covid-19 tests.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kanpur/covid-cases-surge-again-in-city-amid-laxity-in-following-norms/articleshow/88655163.cms||---

Only one parent can accompany the child for registration and they should put on masks and maintain social distancing." Given the paucity of staff, since the nurses are on strike, there will be limited vaccination session sites. "Later, these sessions will be organised in schools as well," said an official in the health department.The schools have asked the parents for their consent. Dakha Government Senior Secondary School principal Dimple Madaan, who is education department’s nodal officer for vaccination, said: "When the schools opened on January 1 after winter break, we sent messages to the parents for their consent. We expect to receive the replies in a day or two."She said: "Once we have the consent, we will approach the dispensaries close to the schools and take the students there on our own, like we did for Covid-19 sampling. However, if the session sites are far, then it will hassle us, as the strength in most of the senior secondary schools is way more that we can handle over a longer journey. The lack of conveyance will make it risky to take so many students to the sites."Madaan claimed that the principals will convince the health department to organise the camps in the schools, and once they receive the consent, they can invite even the neighbouring schools over for the sessions. Otherwise, visiting the dispensary is risky for the school authorities, as the teachers will be held accountable if anything goes wrong."District education officer (DEO) Lakhbir Singh Samra said: "The principals have informed eligible students about the vaccination sites and asked for their parents’ consent. Most of the children above 18 are vaccinated." Central Board of Secondary Education’s deputy city coordinator Harmeet Kaur Waraich said: "Most of the private schools are off till January 10. The administration should hold the vaccination camps in the CBSE schools after reopening."She said: "If the camps are arranged in the schools, not only it will be feasible for the teachers and safe for the students but also more schools can be combined for the same. We will seek consent from the parents and inform them about the sites but if they want assurance from the schools, we are ready to give that as well. The parents need awareness and encouragement." Dr Anurag Chaudhary, nodal officer for vaccination at Dayanand Medical College and Hospital, said: "We have ordered the vaccine and will receive the supply soon. The rate will include user charges."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/better-if-shots-for-15-administered-inside-schools-principals-advice/articleshow/88655166.cms||Mehak Jain

Addressing a media conference here on Sunday, the minister said Radha Krishna is trying to gain political mileage by making baseless comments.  “If Radha Krishna feels that some miscreants did recce to kill him, he should immediately complain to the police. Radha never did it, instead, he made open statements before the press. Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy took the issue seriously and provided security, but he sent the gunmen back,” Vellampalli said. “Radha Krishna’s house is located on a main road and many vehicles pass through it. Moving on the road doesn’t mean they are doing recce for murder. We strongly condemn such allegation,” endowments minister said.  Vellampalli said people of Vijayawada forgot Radha Krishna who is a part-time politician who never stayed with the public.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/minister-seeks-evidence-of-death-threat-to-radha/articleshow/88653016.cms||Venu Lanka

The owners of Focal Point factories and plots that lie in the PSIEC’s jurisdiction wanted this relaxation to recover from the economic impact of Covid-19 pandemic.In a statement issued on Saturday, Kotli had said: "Keeping in view the economic slowdown and resultant disruption in the supply chain as a result of Covid-19 Pandemic in previous years, we have decided to extend the policy of the relief to the PSIEC plot holders once more, from September 16, 2021, to December 31, 2021." Welcoming the decision, Ludhiana MSME (micro, small, and medium enterprises) association president Harish Kairpal said: "We are grateful to the industry minister for accepting our long-pending demand of waiving the interest that the PSIEC charged under various schemes and for various offences. Kotli on Saturday gave the PSIEC plot holders three more months of interest relief. The old deadline had expired on September 16, 2021."United Cycle and Parts Manufacturers Association (UCPMA) former president Inderjit Singh Navyug said: "The extension of the interest-free period is a big relief to the local industry, as the focal points are home to many factories and this waiver applies to all the schemes. For all intents and purposes, the PSIEC will charge us no interest or penal interest. The business had suffered unprecedented disruption during the first and second waves of Covid-19."The industrial focial points of the state are otherwise in a a pitiable condition and these factory zones need upgraded infrastructure such as internal roads, street lights and sewerage networks.

On Saturday, police booked LPA president Rajinder Ghai and some other members of this parents’ union, charging them with trespass, criminal intimidation, criminal conspiracy, committing an obscene act in a public, and obstructing a public servant from discharging his duty. Government Teacher Union, Gazetted Education Schools Association, Headmasters Association, Ministerial Staff Clerks Association, Democratic Teachers Front, retired principals, and Bharatiya Kisan Union (Dakaunda and Ugrahan) condemned the LPA’s action.Teachers’ front media coordinator D S Chinna said: "We will take mass leave of absence and protest outside the DC’s office on Monday. We want the culprits arrested or we will intensity the protest." Central Board of Secondary Education’s deputy city coordinator Harmeet Kaur Waraich told TOI: "It is unfortunate. The parents should not have misbehaved with the DEO. What message have they given to their children by acting so irresponsibly. They need urgent counselling after their arrest. Teachers are most respected members of society and a DEO represents them all." The alumni of Ludhiana’s SCD Government College also condemned the incident. Alumni association coordinator Brij Goyal said: "Insulting the teachers is unacceptable." Supporting the teachers, Deepak Puri, parent of a 14-year-old student, said: "Aggressive people shouldn’t be let into any office. Yes, the LPA represents the parents but no parent will support its behaviour. If they had a grouse and it was unaddressed, they could have gone to the law, the court, or the education minister." Retired principal Anoop Passi said: "The culprits should be put behind bars. They make videos inside the schools to blackmail the principals and the teachers, and they threaten the staff." The LPA office-bearers didn’t pick up their calls. To avoid the press, they switched off their mobile phones.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/parent-assn-reps-on-the-run-after-insulting-deo-teachers-protest/articleshow/88655170.cms||Mehak Jain

The drive has kicked off amid strike by more than 70% staff, mostly contractual healthcare workers under National Health Mission scheme.Civil surgeon Dr S P Singh said, “Covaxin is to be used for 15-18-year age group. The vaccination will be done at the existing sites and not in schools. There will be separate teams for their vaccination and other rules remain the same.”To start with, it will be done at six urban community heath centres (UCHCs), civil hospital in Ludhiana (urban) and sub-divisional hospitals in outer areas. They have asked the health blocks, including Pakhowal and Payal, among others, to vaccinate the age group and they will do it if they get vaccinators for it, he added.The health department officials said the vaccination will be done in Ludhiana at community heath centres (CHCs) in Jawaddi, Shimlapuri, Subhash Nagar, Giaspura; Mother and Child Hospital (MCH) in Vardhman; civil surgeon office complex; Dr Ambedkar Bhawan, Salem Tabri; and civil hospital.

He mentioned in the letter how for want of architects’ technical input, the government and volunteer agencies had failed to decongest the roads despite all efforts. He wrote that: "This is the situation even in the upcoming smart cities such as Ludhiana, Amritsar, and Jalandhar. Apart from the lack of coordination between development agencies, the other reason is unauthorised construction, where many big buildings cover the entire ground floor, leaving no space for the parking lot."He suggested multilevel parking lots for all the upcoming smart cities, including Ludhiana, and regretted that the state administration had not used the central grants for urban renewal optimally. The letter mentions common problems across all Punjab cities along with the solutions that can be discussed and implemented quickly.The Punjab chapter of the Indian Institute of Architects has requested the Punjab government to sit with the state’s architect-planners and special purpose vehicles (SPVs) of the smart cities to take up citizen-desired projects to make cities more liveable. The letter mentions urban issues other than traffic as well. Those issues include garbage disposal, rainwater harvesting, sewerage, water supply, landscaping, proper electrification, LED street lights, functional traffic lights, and CCTV (closed-circuit television) cameras for surveillance and security.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/architects-want-say-in-planning-write-to-cm/articleshow/88655172.cms||---
---||Ludhiana||GST raid without notice: Businessmen oppose rule||Ludhiana: GST hike on textiles rolled back, local businessmen are up in arms against the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) once again, this time over a new rule applicable from January 1. The rule says that in if the GSTR-3B return fails to show the exact tax due, there can be a GST raid on the business without notice, and the owner will get no hearing.Calling this "a draconian rule", the businessmen demand that it be withdrawn and claim that its implementation will lead to unnecessary harassment of the honest businessmen who miss payment deadlines due to genuine reasons. Fasteners Manufacturers Association of India president Narinder Bhamra said: "We fail to understand why the central government and its departments such as the CBIC have to impose harsh laws on businessmen and then repent.”He said: “A few days ago, after a countrywide protest, they had to roll back the proposed hike in the GST on textiles and garments from 5 to 12%. But they failed to learn from this mistake and imposed other rule on us that gives undue powers to the tax inspectors to raid our factories anytime on the pretext of recovering taxes. This seems a conspiracy to finish the country’s business sector."Knitwear Club chairman Vinod Thapar said: "It is beyond our understanding why the government has allowed its departments to make it tougher for us to do business. The new rule is weird, since in case a garment manufacturer has shown invoices of Rs 50 lakh in his GSTR-1 but showed taxes on only Rs 5 lakh of sales in GSTR-3B, the GST officers can just barge into his factory to recover Rs 45 lakh without notice. There are situations when some businessmen can make this mistake inadvertently or due to some genuine reasons. The government should reconsider its decision and scrap the rule."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/gst-raid-without-notice-businessmen-oppose-rule/articleshow/88655174.cms||Mohit Behl

Commission president KK Kareer and member Jaswinder Singh ordered them to pay a composite compensation of Rs 5,500 besides refunding the subscription fee of Rs 5,500 to customer Kanika Dhir of Kitchlu Nagar.In her complaint to the commission on November 15, 2018, the complainant said she had joined the gym at Kitchlu Nagar Chowk, Humbran Road, and paid Rs 5,500 subscription fee for four months (July 27, 2018, to November 27, 2018). She started visiting the gym, but found that there was no woman trainer and some of the equipment also did not function properly. On August 16, 2018, she learned that the gym has downed shutters. She visited the premises, but wasn’t heard. On August 20, she received a message from Mohit (proprietor/ partner/ authorised signatory of the gym), saying the facility would not operate until further notice. As the opposite parties didn’t appear, proceedings took place ex parte. The commission held, “From the evidence, it stands proved on record that after having received the subscription fee for four months on July 27, 2018, the opposite parties closed the gym indefinitely within less than a month.

Its cellphone based functionality would alert nearby farmers, government agencies and other stakeholders about the impending threat. The technology innovation has won the PhD scholar, Snehal Jamalpure, an award by National Bio Entrepreneurship Competition. Snehal and her team under scientists Kishore Paknikar and Jyutika Rajwade have devised ‘Matsya Suraksha’, a technique for identifying viral diseases affecting the aquaculture industry. She was among the 46 finalists, who were rated on uniqueness, scalability and business potential factors. Snehal said, “On a global scale the viral diseases lead to huge economic losses that run into billions. Matsya-Suraksha will allow farmers to detect fish infections on-site in less than 30 minutes and help take remedial measures. The paper-based biosensor comprises specific recognition elements like antibodies, peptides etc and gold nanoparticles as the label to visualize the result of the diagnostic. These procedures for bio-sensing and detection of viral pathogens have been standardized earlier in the laboratory at ARI.” In addition to the paper-based biosensor, ‘Matsya Suraksha’ provides cellphone-based functionality which would alert nearby farmers, government agencies and other stakeholders about the impending threat.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/ari-team-develops-kit-totackle-viral-threat-to-fish/articleshow/88655187.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

After Arora disconnected the call, the miscreants sent him abusive audio recordings and also threatened to shoot him dead.Following this, Arora lodged a written complaint with the Division 7 police on Sunday. Arora has suffered attacks twice, once in a targeted killing bid. He said, “I have been receiving abusive and threatening calls for the past one-and-a-half months from international numbers, but I ignored them. On Sunday, I received calls from two different Pakistan numbers. They threatened me not to appear before the court to give statement as a witness in the targeted killing case hearing in February. When I disconnected, they sent voice notes from different numbers, abusing me and threatening to shoot me soon. I have given a written complaint at Division 7 police station. The police have initiated a probe.”On February 22, 2020, Arora was attacked by unidentified assailants in Sector 39, Ludhiana, when he and his friends, including another leader of the same organisation Mani Sheera, were sitting in the latter’s office in Satkartar car bazaar. They escaped unhurt. “An FIR was lodged against unidentified accused and my security was increased. Later, the then ADGP (intelligence) RN Dhoke had told me that it was a terror attack,” said Arora.Prior to this, on February 3, 2016, radicals had attacked Arora near Basti Jodhewal when he was having soup at a stall. A bullet had grazed his neck. However, on June 22, 2016, Ludhiana police booked Arora, his then gunman and accomplices for stage managing the attack.

With this, the state’s tally of confirmed Covid-19 cases linked to the Omicron variant shot up to 510 and the district’s tally reached 108. Pune mayor Muralidhar Mohol on the highest single-day reporting of Omicron cases in the civic limits said there is absolutely nothing to worry as all the positive patients are under observation. They either have mild symptoms or no symptoms at all, he said. He said the authorities are taking necessary precautions in terms of treatment of the positive patients. Sanjeev Wavare, the assistant health officer of the PMC, said around 4,000 international travellers have been reported from November 1 in the Pune limits. On Sunday’s single-day spike in Omicron cases he said more than 350 close contacts have been traced but refrained from divulging more details. The press statement from the state public health department said out of Sunday’s 50 reported patients, 38 have been reported by the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), and 12 by the National Centre for Cell Science (NCCS).

---||Pune||Highway patrol team steps up drive on seat belt adherence||PUNE: The city unit of the Highway Safety Patrol (HSP) has stepped up its drive against four-wheeler drivers violating the mandatory use of seat belts while driving on the Pune-Mumbai Expressway. Inspections had come to a halt for the better part of 2020 and the first half of 2021 because of the situation caused by Covid-19 infection. The HSP gradually started checking for seat belt violations from July 2021 and has now accelerated action. A total of 7,538 drivers and co-passengers have been monetarily penalised between January and November this year for violating the seat belt norm as against the 2,971 fined in the entire 2020. In 2019, the HSC had fined 16,391 motorists for such violations. Earlier, the police used to slap a fine of Rs200 on individuals driving without seat belts. However, from December 1, 2021, the police have started charging Rs500 from such violators. According to the HSP, the police will charge Rs1,500 from the driver caught for the second time without a seat belt. Wearing seat belt is considered an effective way of reducing accident deaths on high-speed corridors such as the expressway. It has often been seen that many deaths could have been averted had the drivers or the co-passengers been wearing the seat belts as most mishaps result from cars and SUVs crashing into stationary or slow-moving heavy vehicles. The police said that many a times, rear-seat passengers have died after hitting a stationary vehicle at a high speed on the expressway. “We inspect vehicles at the Urse toll and also our interceptor vehicles check the cars or SUVs at different points of the expressway. The inspections will continue,” said Sanjay Jadhav, the HSP superintendent of Pune. Jadhav said, “If a driver or a co-passenger is found without wearing seat belts on the expressway, we impose fines on them.” “After the Covid-19 outbreak in the country, we stopped taking action against motorists driving without seat belts as the policemen check cars and SUVs personally at the toll plazas. This would have made policemen and motorists vulnerable in the wake of the infection,” Jadhav said. He added, “Inspections have been resumed to reduce fatalities on the expressway.” Most four-wheeler passengers fail to wear seat belts even though it is mandatory, even in city areas.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/highway-patrol-team-steps-up-drive-on-seat-belt-adherence/articleshow/88655195.cms||---

Covid guidelines issued by the home department said the order is applicable for both government and private schools within the limits of Jaipur Municipal Corporation (Greater/Heritage). The government’s move comes on a day the city reported 224 fresh infections, which took the active cases count past the 1,000 mark. “Schools are advised not to force students from classes 9-12 to attend offline classes. They are advised to run online classes as per their schedule,” said Kana Ram, director, secondary education, Bikaner. In other districts, the district collectors, district magistrates and local education officials have been directed to hold discussions with the government before taking any call on schools and colleges. Considering the risks associated with mass gathering of people in marriages, the state has re-imposed the limit of allowing a maximum of 100 persons. The only relief is that the figure excludes band players and cooks. It will be applicable from January 7. Marriage parties have to inform the details of the wedding on covidinfo.rajasthan.gov.in or dial 181. “Since Covid protocols are barely followed in marriages, sub divisional officers (SDOs) have been assigned the task of monitoring the protocols,” said an official. The airport Covid team has been directed to compulsory check the RT-PCR test reports of international passengers. Until the RT-PCR test report comes negative, a passenger will have to stay at home or be under institutional quarantine. Similarly for domestic passengers, it is compulsory to show their double vaccinated certificate and RT-PCR negative report 72 hours prior to arrival at the airport. “In case passengers fail to show the double vaccinated certificate and the RT-PCR negative report, he/she has to undergo the instant RT-PCR test,” reads the report.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/stricter-curbs-in-city-as-cases-surge/articleshow/88653965.cms||---

The bridge is reserved for two-wheeler movement and heavy vehicles are prohibited on it. A video showing the bus climbing the median to negotiate an acute turn on the bridge went viral on social media, following which the Deccan Gymkhana police had written to the PMPML higher-ups seeking stern action against the errant bus driver. Dattatray Zende, the PMPML’s traffic manager, told TOI, “Both the driver and the conductor of the bus have been suspended. We did not even wait for the police report to come by and placed the two under suspension with immediate effect. All drivers and conductors have been instructed to obey traffic regulations and not endanger the lives of passengers in anyway. Both the driver and conductor are responsible for the buses they drive each day. Such mistakes cannot be tolerated.” “We will take legal action against the bus driver after receiving a report from the PMPML,” Karpe said adding, “A case of rash and negligent driving can be registered against the bus driver,” said senior inspector Muralidhar Karpe of the Deccan Gymkhana police. Police said on December 25, vehicular movement on the Lakdi Pul was prohibited to facilitate the installation of the Pune Metro Rail girder. Instead of taking any other bridge to cross the Mutha river, the driver drove the bus on the ‘Z’ bridge. “We sent a notice to the PMPML administration on December 27 after coming across the video clip,” said Karpe. “The bus driver should have used another route to reach Deccan area instead of driving on the narrow lane of ‘Z’ bridge,” Karpe said. “It was risky for both, the passengers as well as for the ‘Z’ bridge users. Not only this, some cars and tempos also followed the bus on the bridge,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/bus-goes-on-a-dangerous-run-on-2-wheeler-bridge/articleshow/88655197.cms||Joy Sengupta

In a press statement, PMC stated that each site will offer 250 Covaxin doses, half of which will be available via walk-in registration, while the rest via online registration. All 40 sites under PMC are distributed across the 15 zones of the civic body.Meanwhile, the PCMC has stated that its eight hospitals will offer 500 doses each, all via prior online registration. Pune rural has also planned around 100 sessions across 13 talukas in the district for the said age category on Monday.Suryakant Devkar, chief immunisation officer at PMC, told TOI, “The vaccination for the age group of 15-18 years will be inaugurated at Dalvi Hospital in Shivajinagar in presence of the Pune mayor Muralidhar Mohol and civic commissioner Vikram Kumar. The beneficiaries will be given roses, masks, or pens across different sites. Considering the possibility of the crowding of parents as well at the vaccination sites, distancing will be strictly followed.” Devkar said that it is unlikely they will conduct separate vaccination camps in schools or colleges for 15-18-year-olds. PCMC commissioner Rajesh Patil told TOI, “There are ample doses available for beneficiaries across the eight civic hospitals that plan to offer the same. All these sites are spread across eight zones under our civic limits.” Notably, the 15-18 age group will be offered only Covaxin — there is no choice of Covishield, as per the health department officials. On Sunday, the district recorded vaccinations of only 10,479 beneficiaries across the district’s 231 government and private vaccination sites till 8 pm. The district now has administered a total of 1.51 crore doses of Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik V, of which 87.14 lakh are first doses and 64.20 lakh are second doses.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/online-vax-slots-for-15-to-18-age-group-open-from-today/articleshow/88655198.cms||---

The incident took place in the early hours of Saturday. While the police are yet to arrest the guard, who is on the run, an investigation has revealed that he was upset with his supervisor, who had not paid him salary for the last two months. Sarvankumar Shah (44) of Dehu has filed a complaint with the Bhosari MIDC police in this matter. When contacted, Shah told TOI that early on Saturday morning, he was informed about the incident at the site in Moshi. “When I reached there, I found that windscreens of 12 heavy vehicles, including dumpers and mixer trucks, were broken. A light commercial vehicle with a generator was completely charred at the spot,” Shah said. Shah said that he came to know that one of the security guards at the site had gone berserk and damaged the vehicles. “The guard was deployed by a private security agency, which we have appointed at the site,” Shah said. Shah said, “We suffered losses of more than Rs6 lakh, that too for no fault of ours. We have sought an explanation from the security agency.” An officer from the Bhosari MIDC police told TOI that a prima facie probe has revealed that the guard was upset as he did not get his salary for the past two months. “In a fit of rage, he damaged the vehicles. We have launched a search for him,” the officer said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/denied-salary-guard-damages-12-vehicles/articleshow/88655200.cms||---

We can also increase vaccination sites whenever the same is needed,” Pawar added.Beneficiaries can register their names via the Cowin app as well. However, the ZP authorities said around 5,000 had registered/enrolled their names for via the app, so far. “We got a dismal response through the application, so we will be conducting on-the-spot registration and vaccination at the school-level through the primary health centres (PHCs) in the rural areas. It will help us cover maximum beneficiaries of the age group,” said Dr Abhay Tidke, the district immunization officer.Tidke said around 2.2 lakh beneficiaries were eligible from the group to get vaccine doses in rural Pune.“Most of these beneficiaries are from Std IX to XII. Their school identity card is sufficient for them to get the vaccine,” Tidke added.Apart from school students, Tidke said that angwadi and Asha workers would identify beneficiaries at the village-level and administer doses.“This number would not be big in the district. But still, we have a plan for it,” Tidke added.Ayush Prasad, ZP’s CEO, said the heads of all 96 PHCs were told to monitor the drives and address the concerns in their limits. “Vaccination of students will be conducted smoothly as our PHCs and sub-centres have been told to work in tandem with school authorities,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/zp-gives-approval-for-on-spot-vaccination-in-101-centres/articleshow/88655202.cms||---

KS Hosalikar, senior IMD scientist and head of the surface instrument division at the Climate Research and Services of IMD, Pune, told TOI, “The city will not experience a significant change in minimum temperature at least for the next 48 hours. Thereafter, temperature is likely to go up due to western disturbances and associated weather systems in the next few days.” The city’s night temperatures have remained above normal by two to three degrees Celsius for the last two weeks. On Sunday, Shivajinagar was 15.7 degrees Celsius and Lohegaon 17.1 degrees Celsius, which were above normal in the range of four to five degrees Celsius, said the IMD officials. The city on Sunday recorded a slight increase in the day temperature. Shivajinagar recorded 29.2 degrees Celsius and Lohegaon 28.2 degrees Celsius, which were below normal in the range of one or two degrees Celsius, added the meteorological officials. As per the forecast, minimum temperatures are expected to be slightly higher than normal during this period, from Wednesday (January 5) onwards. Hosalikar said parts of Pune district, such as Shirur, the NDA area and other places on the outskirts, recorded single-digit minimum temperatures on a few days in the last two weeks. Officials also predicted partly cloudy sky conditions on Monday. Skies will remain clear on Tuesday and Wednesday. From Thursday to Saturday, partly cloudy conditions return. “Day temperatures will hover from 29-30 degrees Celsius; night temperatures will be between 15-19 degrees Celsius,” said an official from the IMD, adding, “Cloudy skies conditions will have an impact on day temperatures and this usually keeps them below the normal range. At the same time, night temperatures remain on the higher side. This is due to less sunlight reaching the Earth’s surface.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/city-to-experience-cool-days-warmer-nights-imd/articleshow/88655203.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune airport set to get new terminal, parking lot in 2022||PUNE: The city airport is looking ahead to the completion of its new terminal building and multi-level parking lot this year after accomplishing the crucial runway re-carpeting work last year. The new terminal building is expected to be operational by August giving a boost to passenger traffic, facilities and flight movements. Similarly, the multi-level parking is expected to go functional from March and could end the perennial parking problems at the airport. “It is a crucial year considering two important projects — the new integrated terminal building and the multi-level car parking lot — will be ready this year. The projects will elevate the airport in terms of facilities and infrastructure. The projects are expected to end the many problems flyers face each day at the airport and also play an important part towards the increase in flight and passenger traffic,” an airport official said. In October 2021, Pune MP and airport advisory committee chairman Girish Bapat had said the car parking facility needed to start from January simultaneously with the ongoing construction work, as parking has become a major problem at the airport. An official, however, said there’s some more work to be done before it’s finally opened to public. “The project consists of a skywalk, which will connect the parking to the existing terminal building. We have been told that the parking lot will be ready by March. Vehicles can be parked in the facility from March, while the work on the skywalk will continue and will be completed by April. We are expecting full-scale operations of the parking lot from April end,” an airport source said. Officials said while the construction of the multi-level parking was around 75% complete, the new terminal building’s construction was also in advanced stages. “The new terminal building is important for the airport and has many features. The work is around 65% complete and we are expecting it to be ready and operational by August. However, some bottlenecks such as shifting of the existing cargo-hold area and vacation of land by HPCL and BPCL remains. The timely completion of the project depends on them. It has been more than a year that the existing cargo-hold area is awaiting a shift. The new terminal building cannot be integrated to the existing one unless the bottlenecks are removed,” another official said. Flyers as well as aviation experts said the projects needed to be completed on priority. “At present there are far too many infrastructural problems at the airport and flyers are never at ease. While parking is a major hassle, the scene inside the terminal building is mostly chaotic. While the two projects are a welcome step and should be completed on priority, wonder why isn’t the state divulging details on the new airport announced in 2016?” asked Shekhar Devadiga, a trader and frequent flyer. Aviation analyst Dhairyashil Vandekar said the focus needed to shift on the proposed new airport. “The new projects can hold the capacity of the airport for some time considering that the Pune airport is among the 10 busiest airports in the country. The focus needs to be on the new airport project at Purandar,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/pune-airport-set-to-get-new-terminal-parking-lot-in-2022/articleshow/88655205.cms||Joy Sengupta

They should help sensitize voters about candidates and the importance of voting, because ultiately, an informed decision about voting is a must, said Jagdeep Chokkar, co-founder of the Association of Democratic Reforms. He was speaking at a panel discussion organised to mark the eighth anniversary of ‘RTI Katta’, an initiative of city-based Right To Information activists. Chokkar was speaking on “citizen activism and civic elections”, and said “constitutional awareness is a must for the public as the voters”. Activists should work as models for the other citizens, he said.Mahesh Zagade, former principal secretary (GAD) of Maharashtra, said that asking questions about candidates and their parties is very necessary for the voters. Activists can ask questions on behalf of the people to the candidates. They must probe how elected members are going to work in making the civic administration and municipal facilities better. Corner meetings should be organised to interact and question the candidate, he added.“The one ward system is more effective that the multi-ward system and should be promoted,” he said. According to the activists, the initiative aims at creating awareness about RTI. It has been started to educate people about the power given to them under this act.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/role-of-citizen-activists-can-help-voters-says-expert/articleshow/88655206.cms||---

The incident occurred between 2am and 7am on Saturday. Senior police inspector (SPI) Swati Desai of the Sahakarnagar police informed TOI, “Ganesh Manohar Fartade, who was unmarried, and his mother, Nirmala Fartade, a patient of blood pressure, deiabetes and a knee ailment, were both living in a 1 BHK rented flat in the society for the last 12 years at least. His father had died earlier, and his two aunts live in Erandwane and Salisbury Park.” “Fartade lost his job as an engineer with a private company in March 2021, and was struggling to find a new job. He landed in deep financial trouble after suffering losses in the stock market and also ran into debts,” Desai said, citing a five-page note Fartade had written on paper and then clicked pictures of the notes finally sending them to his aunt on WhatsApp. “He also mentioned that he was worried about his mother’s health and if he ends his life, his mother would suffer a lot,” Desai added. “Frustrated by his day-to-day struggle for survival and the expenses towards the treatment of his mother, Fartade drafted a note explaining the reasons behind his drastic action and then sent it to his aunt in Erandwane around 2.45am,” said inspector Yunus Mulani of the Sahakarnagar police. “His aunt saw the message around 7am when she woke up and alerted other relatives. Fartade’s other aunt from Salisbury Park rushed to his flat and raised an alarm on realizing that the flat was locked from inside,” Mulani added. The police, called at the site, broke open the door and found Nirmala lying in the bedroom with a rope tied around her neck and a plastic bag covering her face. Fartade was found hanging from a ceiling hook in the bedroom. “Investigation revealed that Fartade gave excess medicine to his mother to sedate her before suffocating her by covering her face with a plastic bag and then strangling her with a rope,” said Mulani. “We have recovered the cell phone used for posting the note and have recorded statements of his relatives and other witnesses,” he said. He added that a case of murder and accidental death was registered later on Saturday night. “Fartade’s cousin, Shonit Sawant (35) of Erandwane, lodged a complaint in this regard,” Mulani said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/jobless-engineer-in-debt-kills-mother-hangs-self/articleshow/88655208.cms||---

At present, one such bus has been designed on instructions from MSRTC vice chairman and managing director Shekhar Channe,” D G Chikorde, works manager in the Dapodi workshop ,told TOI. “It took us around a fortnight to design the bus. We had designed a similar bus in the past as per instructions of the senior officials but more changes were needed. Mahabaleshwar Darshan is an important service for the MSRTC. The roof of the bus has been designed with toughened glass and passenger can see the surroundings as they travel. Similarly, the windows of the bus are wide to almost waist height for a better viewing experience,” Chikorde said.  “We will be working as per the directions of the senior officials. More such buses will surely be developed and given to the different divisions especially for Mahabaleshwar Darshan. Since Pune isn’t very far from the tourist spot, the division will be getting such buses too. The seating arrangement in the bus has been created differently and resembles that of a movie theatre.

Stating that former deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam (OPS) had recently asked the government to do away with the GST on application and other fees, he said it looked like OPS was either not aware that the same was introduced during the AIADMK regime in 2018 or had conveniently forgotten the same. “While the AIADMK government had made efforts to collect the GST arrears, the DMK government has suspended the move,” Balaji said. He was in the city to inaugurate construction of new roads in the corporation limits at a cost of 3.18 crore. “New roads will be laid for a distance of 7.01km.” Referring to the OPS statement that the DMK, which had opposed the AIADMK move to install meters for free power connections to farmers, was silently fixing the same, the minister said the exercise had begun in 2016 by the previous government. He said more than 4.52 lakh farmers had registered for the free power in the past 20 years and chief minister M K Stalin had given an assent to provide connection to one lakh farmers in a year. To a question on the irregularities in procuring garbage bins for the Coimbatore corporation during the AIADMK rule, the minister said that irregularities were also found in procuring vehicles for garbage collection. "Several such incidents took place in the past. They will be identified and the government will take legal action against those involved," he said. The minister later visited 21-year-old Mohan Kumar, of Pollachi, who was undergoing treatment in a private hospital on Mettupalayam Road under the ‘Innuyir Kaappom’ scheme after he met with an accident on December 22, 2021. Under the scheme, empanelled hospitals could provide free treatment to the accident victims in the first 48 hours and claim the expenses later.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/no-gst-on-power-bill-says-minister/articleshow/88655216.cms||---

The temporary staffers which are backbone when it comes to teaching and non-teaching activities at the campus were anxious after university had put a halt on the appointment process. Gujarat government, through a circular issued in the first week of November, had asked all the state university to consult it before taking any decision regarding appointments of temporary staff members. “Based on the circular issued by the state government, we have sent details of all the temporary staff members to the government and sought its guidance,” said MSU registrar Dr K M Chudasama. “The syndicate members have passed a resolution to continue services of such staffers as the academic year has already begun from June. We will abide by the directives from Gujarat government. But till we receive guidance the services of such staffers will continue as per the existing terms and conditions,” he said. The syndicate members will review their decision again after 90 days if there is no directive or guidance from Gujarat government by then.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/msu-to-continue-with-temporary-staff/articleshow/88653560.cms||---

---||Meerut||Meerut boy develops IoT-based badminton racket with sensors||MEERUT: Parth Batra, a class 12 student from a city school, sought to develop a device that could store data of a player’s game, like the movement and speed of their shots, which can be reviewed later to work on the performance. Batra, who is also a badminton player at a Noida stadium and has received world class training in Thailand, hit upon the idea of making the racket itself into a recording device, using Internet of Things (IoT) technology, which can be used to track physical objects with sensors. The lad, who is a science student, realised during his training that the feedback of each player can be improved using the technology. “A coach cannot always keep a watch on every single player’s game. Then what can be done to fix this. I thought what if we can record our actions which can be seen later. We can not only see our game, but also those who play really well. We can analyse it and can make them better,” said Parth. Curious to know what his idea can actually do on the ground, the student then attached a simple badminton racket in a new form through IoT. “Through the racket that I have made, the movement data of the shots played by the badminton player can be viewed on the computer screen and can also be analysed with the help of Data Science. What is special about this process is that it can be determined through analysis what type of movement will help the player to improve his game. Many such complex techniques are being used today under the discipline of sports analytics to enhance the quality and skills of sports and players,” added Parth who had used accelerometer and gyroscope sensors along with an arduino nano programming board to develop the racket and send data to the computer. The badminton racket is now used by him and several other players at the stadium venue.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/meerut-boy-develops-iot-basedbadminton-racket-with-sensors/articleshow/88655223.cms||---

At present, the STF sends the seized or recovered wildlife parts to the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) in Dehradun for forensic examination.Though the STF’s main mandate is to curb organised crimes and drug trafficking in the state, protection of endangered wildlife species and crackdown against wildlife smugglers has also remained its focus area. “We feel the necessity for establishment of a wildlife forensic unit at the State Forensic Science Laboratory (SFSL) or the Odisha University of Agriculture and Technology (OUAT). Wildlife body parts are being recovered at regular intervals. It costs a lot and takes a long time to send the wildlife crime exhibits to the WII in Dehradun for a forensic test,” an STF officer said. The STF has seized at least 22 leopard skins, 12 elephant tusks, 7 deer skins, 15 pangolin scales and rescued 8 pangolins since 2020 till now. Altogether 51 people were arrested during the period for their alleged involvement in the wildlife crimes. Experts said there is a need to sensitise enforcement agencies in wildlife crime scene investigation and proper collection of evidence through regular training and workshops. “The government should rope in expert agencies to provide advanced training on wildlife crime analysis. This would help their capacity building to combat wildlife crime,” said R N Sharma, who works in wildlife conservation. Recently, chief minister Naveen Patnaik praised the STF for effectively curbing wildlife crimes in the state. Last year, the STF launched a helpline number (9439263646) to receive information on wildlife crimes.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/stf-seeks-spl-forensic-unit-for-study-of-wildlife-parts/articleshow/88655225.cms||Debabrata Mohapatra

In bulk of the cases, unidentified cyber crooks took away money from victims by offering them high returns through different schemes, purchases of pharmaceutical products, online trading, installation of mobile towers and sending gift parcels from abroad. The Crime Branch had also started an investigation to trace a cyber criminal, who defrauded nearly Rs 7 lakh from five persons after hacking the WhatsApp number of Manoj Pattnaik, the chief executive officer (CEO) of Odisha Computer Application Centre (OCAC) in November last year. The hacker took control over Pattnaik’s WhatsApp number and sent messages to his close contacts claiming that he required urgent financial help for treatment. Though the victims of all the cases transferred money to some accounts shared by the scammers, the investigators have not yet succeeded in tracing those persons. In the OCAC CEO case, the Crime Branch claimed that a Nigerian gang was involved. But the cops have not been able to trace the real culprits.

Chadha accused the Charanjit Singh Channi government of registering a weak FIR against Majithia ahead of the Punjab legislative assembly elections.The Congress government, which had promised to end the drugs trade in Punjab within three weeks, did nothing in the last five years, he claimed. He alleged, “Now that the assembly elections are approaching, an unsuccessful attempt is being made to mislead the people of the state by registering an FIR against Akali Dal leader Bikram Singh Majithia.”He alleged that the Aam Aadmi Party had already expressed apprehensions that under a “secret deal” between the Channi government and SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal, it was decided that an FIR would be registered against Majithia but he would not be arrested.This was being done to return favour to the Badal family which had helped brother of Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, who was allegedly involved in the Ludhiana City Center scam, he claimed.Chadha expressed surprise that despite an FIR and rejection of anticipatory bail against Bikram Majithia, he was not arrested. He said that it has been almost two weeks since the FIR was registered on December 20, 2021.“Majithia is roaming freely despite being denied anticipatory bail. Pictures of accused offering prayers at Harmandir Sahib on New Year, are going viral on social media,” he said.Chadha also alleged that Channi and Sukhbir had “complete complicity in the drugs trade”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/aap-accuses-cm-of-deliberately-not-arresting-majithia/articleshow/88655235.cms||---

Selja said the BJP MP from Bhiwani himself raised allegations of illegal mining in Dadam and the miners digging deep into the ground without permission. “It’s clear that nothing was right in Dadam. Due to illegal mining in the Aravallis, the tax revenue of the country and the state was stolen,” she said.Selja said if a fair investigation would be conducted, the Dadam mining case could prove to be the biggest scam so far in the history of the state. “Its scope goes beyond what people can think. Therefore, it is important to have a high-level fair investigation,” she added. She said the state government had not made any announcement for the families of those who lost their lives and the injured in this incident. “This shows the insensitivity of the state government. The Congress demands Rs 25 lakh as assistance be released to the families of each person who lost his life due to the fall of the hill and Rs 10 lakh be released to the injured,” she said.Selja said the mining in Dadam was done as a part of a well-planned conspiracy. “No mining company or mafia has the guts to hollow out a mountain on its own. There are fixed stakes in it. Therefore, along with the general public, there is a ban on the entry of media, cameras and drones in the Dadam mining area. All this was done so that they could tear the mountain at their own will which resulted in the fall of the mountain,” she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/hry-mining-mishap-cong-demands-probe-aid-for-kin/articleshow/88655237.cms||---

Former AAP MP Dr Dharamvira Gandhi, who has been strongly opposing any alliance with AAP, was also present during the function.Even as the speakers at the meeting did not mention any names of senior farm leaders, common refrain was that SSM should contest polls alone and should not have any alliance with AAP. The organisers said that they got support from 45 other organizations. Senior farm leader Ruldu Singh Mansa and actor-writer Amit Mann, who is one of the organisers of Joojhda Punjab, a front launched by some prominent Punjabis from diverse fields, also attended the function. Jamoohri Kisan Sabha leader Kulwant Singh Sandhu, who is also part of SSM, said the meeting was organised to expand the SSM and other organisations were told that they could keep their independent identity even as they would become a part of the SSM. “We decided that SSM would not have any alliance with any party, including AAP. Any farm leader now deciding to ally with AAP would be doing on behalf of his organisation and not on behalf of SSM,” Sandhu told TOI. Asked that how many farm groups, which were part of the SSM were present at the meeting, he claimed that not all were invited and 11 of them attended the meeting. However, Ruldu Singh Mansa told TOI that more groups have joined the SSM and from among the initial SSM members, only seven attended the meeting. He confirmed that the SSM leaders are in touch with a political party but declined to elaborate further. From the initial members, apart from Kulwant Sandhu and Ruldu Singh Mansa, Bogh Singh Mansa of BKU Mansa, Prem Bhangu, Kanwalpreet Singh of Kisan Sangharsh Committee, Harjinder Tanda of Azad Kisan Sangharsh Committee are learnt to have attended the meeting.Dr Gandhi told TOI that it is learnt that a senior farmer leader was in talks with a political party which could not be treated as pro-Punjab and if that happened, the farmer leader would never be forgiven.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/section-of-ssm-rules-out-poll-pact-with-aap/articleshow/88655240.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Sultana chases safari vehicles in Ranthambore||Jaipur: Tourists at Ranthambore National Park (RNP) on Sunday were in for a shock when tigress T-107, popularly known as Sultana, chased their open safari vehicles in Zone-1. A mobile clip of the tigress chasing the gypsies reportedly recorded by a nature guide has gone viral on social media. The big cat can be seen moving close to the Gypsies on the track at a tri-junction before chasing them. Though she did not attack people on board the vehicles, there was a moment of panic among them. “Both the drivers reversed after seeing the charging tigress. Fortunately, as there were no other vehicles on both the tracks, they could reverse in speed,” said a forest official. He said, “As a precautionary measure, the route has been closed for tourists again till further orders. We have also installed cameras at many places in the zone for continuous monitoring of the tigress.” Experts claim chasing vehicles could be a part of the natural instinct of the tigress, but it has never attacked any human till date. Dharmendra Khandal, conservation biologist of Tiger Watch said, “The tigress lives in Zone-1 and its movement is recorded near the human settlements including Ganesh Temple road and Jhoomar Baori. It has never charged at anyone. Some big cats do chase vehicles. Earlier, when tourist activities were less at Ranthambore, there was a tigress named Nasty, which regularly charged vehicles.” This is the third time Sultana has reportedly charged a vehicle. On November 25, a forest staff had a close shave during patrolling when she chased his motorcycle in Zone-1. In a video that went viral in 2019, Sultana came dangerously close to tourists before sprinting alongside their vehicle. The 26-second clip was purportedly shot by tourists.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/sultana-chases-safari-vehicles-in-ranthambore/articleshow/88653976.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Punjab posts nearly 300% rise in Covid cases in 4 weeks||CHANDIGARH: The pandemic has again started to spread its tentacles in the state of Punjab by recording a massive spike of close to 282% in cases in the last four weeks. The resurgence of cases, which by and large remained under control for nearly four months, ahead of the assembly polls and threat of rapidly spreading highly infectious Omicron variant has left public health experts worried. The state reported 1,675 fresh cases in the last four weeks. Between December 5 and 11, 246 cases had surfaced, the count of which went up to 939 during the week ending on January 1. During the period, the number of containment zones increased by 12. Pathankot emerged as the worst affected district with the highest weekly positivity rate of 4.61%, followed by Patiala at 2.67%. Bathinda and Mohali are the two other districts with a weekly positivity rate of 2.25% and 1.26%, which is higher than the state's average of 1%. Patiala and Pathankot account for nearly 44% of 1,041 active cases in the state. Patiala has a maximum of 244 active cases while in Pathankot 211 patients are under treatment. There are 114 active cases in Mohali, 112 in Jalandhar and 110 in Ludhiana. The situation appears to be under control in other districts. Spike attributed to increase in poll related activitiesPatiala and Pathankot account for nearly 44% of 1,041 active cases in the state. Patiala has a maximum of 244 active cases while in Pathankot 211 patients are under treatment. There are 114 active cases in Mohali, 112 in Jalandhar and 110 in Ludhiana. The situation appears to be still under control in other districts. The spike has been attributed to an increase in poll related activities with political parties and people not following the Covid appropriate behaviour. Leaders of all political parties are leaving no stone unturned to persuade voters by organising big gatherings during which laid down norms-social distancing and wearing masks-are thrown to the wind. Dr Rakesh Kumar Gupta, president of Strategic Institute for Public Health Education and Research (Sipher) warned that any laxity at this time can prove fatal. "All stakeholders - politicians and the general public - need to act responsibly and should follow Covid appropriate behaviour so that the pandemic is kept under control," said Dr Gupta who urged them to keep the horror of the second wave in mind. Considering the possible threat of rapid spread, the Election Commission of India, during the recent visit to the state, had directed the Punjab state election commission to ensure compliance with the laid down norms. In case of violation of norms, the commission has the power to bar the defaulting candidates from holding public gatherings. Besides that, necessary action under Disaster Management Act and Epidemic Diseases Act will be initiated by the district administration.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/punjab-posts-nearly-300-rise-in-cases-in-4-weeks/articleshow/88655243.cms||Vinod Kumar

The BJP Punjab affairs in charge, Gajendra Shekhawat, landed at the residence of SAD (Sanyukt) leader Nidhark Singh Brar at Moga on Sunday and admitted him into the saffron party. Interestingly, as the SAD (Sanyukt) is registered in the name of three leaders including Nidhark Singh Brar as general secretary and spokesperson of SAD (Sanyukt), he has joined saffron party informally and after SAD (Sanyukt) will elect some other leader as party general secretary in a day or so, Brar will formally become member of BJP. Brar says he will not contest the election and will oversee affairs in the organisation as he wants to concentrate in national politics. Brar says he is joining BJP after getting affirmation from Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa. Brar, Punjab’s former State Information Commissioner, had sided with Dhindsa after leaving Shiromani Akali Dal led by Sukhbir Singh Badal. Brar, speaking to TOI, said that the BJP is the only party which not believe in nepotism and democracy is still alive in BJP. “No case of corruption has ever been heard in the last 7 years, and the BJP also raise India’s prestige at the international level. Going by it, I have joined the BJP after speaking to Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa. I will concentrate in organisational matters at the national level,” he said. Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa, when contacted, said, “Shekhawat and Brar had spoken to me and I gave my consent to it. He might have some issues in the party, but was working well”. He confessed that Nidhark Brar is one of the three leaders in whose name party is registered and now another leader will be made general secretary.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/amritsar/bjp-poaches-from-own-ally-as-sad-sanyukt-gen-secy-brar-joins-party/articleshow/88655245.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Chandigarh||Haryana: Dadam ‘gold mine’ mining lease has been controversial||CHANDIGARH: Allotment of quarries in Dadam hills of Tosham in Haryana’s Bhiwani district has always been considered a ‘gold mine’ for mining firms. The allotment of lease or contract by the state government for Dadam hills has been controversial with allegations of favouritism marring the process. Even in its order dated August 11, 2017, the Supreme Court had pulled up the Haryana government, observing that the “influence in high places was used” when the government granted mining lease worth Rs 115 crore of Dadam hills in Tosham to a firm that was not even eligible for allotment of the mining contract. A division bench comprising Justice Madan B Lokur and Justice Deepak Gupta had passed these orders while hearing a plea filed by M/s Sunder Marketing Associates. The issue before the apex court was whether the petitioner should be allowed to surrender the mining lease granted to it and if so, under what conditions, if any. “This is a classic case of someone (the petitioner in this case) apparently having influence in high places, using that influence to violate the law and get a benefit that would ordinarily not be granted to anybody else. We cannot say with any degree of certainty how high is the reach of the petitioner but it is quite apparent from the facts of the case, that the reach is pretty high,” the top court bench had observed. Case of high influence: SCA joint venture of M/s Sunder Marketing Associates and its associate Karamjeet Singh & Company was the highest bidder for the Dadam quarry in Bhiwani district with a bid of Rs 115 crores per annum towards dead rent or royalty, whichever is higher. The auction was held in December 2013. Importantly, the joint venture was qualified to participate in the auction, but the petitioner, M/s Sunder Marketing was not qualified to participate in the auction as a single bidder. Later, one of the partners, M/s Karamjeet Singh & Company surrendered its share for certain reasons. On this, M/s Sunder Marketing asked the government to permit it to continue the mining contract. On the basis of the opinion taken from the Haryana advocate general, it was proposed by the concerned mining engineer on June 10, 2015, to allow the transfer of the entire share of the joint venture in favour of the petitioner, subject to certain conditions. This was approved by the superior authorities, including the chief minister of Haryana. Importantly, it was done by the Haryana government despite the fact that M/s Sunder Marketing individually was not even eligible to get that mining lease as a single bidder. Observing it as a case of use of "high influence" by M/s Sunder Marketing in getting Dadam mining lease despite being not eligible, the Supreme Court had held that under no circumstance could the letter of intent or the mining lease have been transferred from the joint venture in favour of the petitioner. "It is this totally illegal transfer carried out within five years of the execution of the mining lease that has prompted us to believe that the petitioner could exercise influence in high places," the SC had held. The apex court, however, had permitted M/s Sunder Marketing to continue mining till November 30, 2017. There were allegations that during that extended period, M/s Sunder Marketing had carried out excavations in the Dadam hills area beyond the permissible norms.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/dadam-gold-mine-mining-lease-has-been-controversial/articleshow/88655246.cms||Ajay Sura

Channi had threatened to sit on dharna against Purohit over the delay in clearing the file “under pressure from BJP”.In a press statement issued here, Purohit said the file regarding regularisation of the services of contractual employees was reverted to the office of Punjab chief minister with six queries to be clarified by the state government. The file was received by CMO on December 31, 2021, and the reply to queries was awaited, the governor said. “I advise the chief ninister to give reply to the queries raised on the file,” said Purohit, and added, “Once the reply comes, the Bill will be re-examined at the governor’s secretariat.”“The Bill regarding regularisation of the services of contractual employees was passed in the state assembly on November 11, 2021. After a lapse of nearly 20 days, the said file was sent to Punjab Raj Bhawan on December 1, 2021. During the month of December, the governor was on tour to various districts of the state. The governor concluded the tour on December 21 and thereafter, on December 23, CM Punjab came and met him at Punjab Raj Bhawan. The file was duly studied and reverted with observation/queries to CMO on December 31, 2021.”The queries raised included the state government’s note having no mention of the current status of court case ‘Anika Gupta Vs state of Punjab, the vires of the ‘The Punjab Adhoc, Contractual, Daily Wage, Temporary Work charged and outsourced employees welfare Act 2016’, which the new bill seeks to repeal and replace.The government was also asked to clarify the number of pending court cases challenging the old Act, besides elaborating whether the current Bill is not in contravention of the order passed on April 4, 2017, by the Punjab and Haryana high court in which the state government was asked to examine the legality of the Act in the light of the decision of Supreme Court in a cases titled ‘state of Karnataka Vs Uma Devi (2006.)The other observations included reference to the opinion of the advocate general dated August 28, 2021, which held that several aspects of the Bill were in contravention of the Supreme Court’s decision. The state was asked to explain how the new bill was not in contravention of the decision of the Apex Court. The governor in the note stated that contractual employees had been recruited from time to time without following the reservation rules and sought an explanation of whether their induction would not disturb the reservation ratio. “Will this not adversely affect the welfare of the underprivileged class of people eligible for reservation?”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/channi-factually-incorrect-should-respond-to-queries-governor-reacts/articleshow/88655248.cms||---
