The agency also stated in the charge sheet that five arrested accused, Minhaj Ahmad, Museeruddin, Shakeel, Moid, and Mustaqeem, were in touch with terror outfit Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind (AGuH), an auxiliary unit of al-Qaida. All the five accused have been booked under the charges of waging war against the government of India, concealing with intent to facilitate design to wage war and other charges including punishment for raising funds for a terrorist act, punishment for recruiting persons for a terrorist act, punishment for being a member of a terrorist gang, membership of a terrorist organisation under the unlawful activities (prevention) Act, 1967. The charge sheet was filed in the special NIA court in Lucknow. NIA in its charge sheet has stated that accused Minhaj Ahmad was radicalized online by two al-Qaida terrorists based in Jammu and Kashmir and that he had entered into a conspiracy with them for recruiting members for AGuH and for committing terrorist acts. Minhaj recruited Museeruddin into the al-Qaida fold and involved him in the conspiracy for committing terrorist acts in UP. It also stated that Museeruddin and Minhaj Ahmad procured arms, ammunition, explosive material and conducted reconnaissance of vulnerable areas for carrying out blasts with an intention to wage war. The other three accused, Shakeel, Mustaqeem and Moid, aided and abetted Minhaj and Museeruddin in procuring weapons and ammunition, thus becoming a party in furtherance of the conspiracy. NIA also said that the case was still under investigation. This module was first busted by the Uttar Pradesh Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) with the arrest of two operatives, identified as Minhaz and Museeruddin, from Lucknow on July 11 and their three associates, Mustaquim, Moid and Shakeel, on July 14. All the five were arrested from different places in Lucknow. ATS had also recovered explosives used for making the improvised explosive device (IED) in the form of a pressure cooker bomb from their possession. NIA had taken up the case on July 28 and registered a fresh case. ATS in its probe had also accused Minhaj Ahmad and Museeruddin of being in touch with Umar Halmandi, the chief of AGuH. Halmandi, according to the investigators, was operating from the Pakistan–Afghanistan border and was recruiting young men for different terror operations in India. ATS had also claimed that the accused were planning blasts around Independence Day and investigators had recovered an IED in the form of a pressure cooker bomb from the Lucknow residence of one of the accused.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nia-files-chargesheet-in-al-qaida-module-case/articleshow/88742248.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty

"A decision to this effect was taken at the security review coordination committee (SRCC) meetings held on July 18, 2021 and September 19, 2021," they said. According to sources, only sitting CMs of J&K are entitled to SSG cover after the Union home ministry amended the Jammu and Kashmir Special Security Group Act of 2000 on March 31, 2020. The ADGP has been directed in writing to reduce the posted strength of SSG personnel to the bare minimum (for ex-CMs), preferably headed by a DSP, to maintain continuity. He has also been asked to post a suitable number of personnel in the security wing for close proximity teams (CPT). "These personnel will continue to receive an allowance (25% of basic pay) as at present," the communique stated. The ADGP has also been directed to post the remaining SSG personnel to other wings to make best use of their knowledge/training and expertise. "All resources (including vehicles, access control gadgets, etc.) of the SSG, except such resources as may be required by SSF, be transferred to the security wing," the letter states. The SSG was created by a law enacted by the J&K legislature in 2000 when Farooq Abdullah helmed the government. Before the enactment of the law, the security of former CMs was governed by the rules and standing operating procedure issued by the CID wing of the J&K police in October 1996.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jammu-and-kashmir-administration-cuts-ssg-cover-of-4-ex-cms-kin/articleshow/88742334.cms||M Saleem Pandit

The debate ensued from an oral question by Lord Harries of Pentregarth asking what representations the UK government was making to Delhi about the "blocking of overseas funds for the Missionaries of Charity and other NGOs". Peers lined up to ask what Britain was doing to seek to have these funds unblocked, with one, Lord Foulkes of Cumnock, suggesting the UK should get multilateral groups like the Commonwealth ecretariat involved because "sometimes multilateral organisations can be better than getting a lecture from the UK". Lord Alton of Liverpool warned there would be appalling consequences for India’s most vulnerable people unless this "iniquitous decision" was reversed. "The work of Mother Teresa and the charity she founded, the Missionaries of Charity, is renowned throughout the world. What possible reason could the Indian government have for wanting to hinder and block their work," asked Pentregarth. "The rumour is it is continuing pressure from Hindu nationalism because people might come into contact with Christianity and eventually convert to it. We need to know from the Indian government in writing what is their reason so we can examine the validity of their reasoning." Lord Bruce of Bennachie said indigenous and government agencies in India do not reach many of the poorest people and asked the UK government to ask Delhi to "explain how those people will be reached if the agencies serving them are withdrawn". Nearly 6,000 organisations lost their FCRA licences on 1 January, either because they failed to renew them or their applications were rejected. On December 25, the MHA refused to renew the FCRA registration of the Missionaries of Charity. Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon, minister for South Asia, representing the UK government, said the UK was raising these issues in constructive manner with the Indian high commission in London, and the Indian government directly, and he was requesting further information so he could analyse the reasons why these licences have been revoked "to allow us to make much more qualified representation". The Indian high commission in London said in statement it would not" like to comment on a discussion between Hon’ble Members of the Parliament of the UK". "It appears to need reiteration that this is a matter of routine processing by India’s ministry of home affairs — of renewal applications for FCRA approval submitted by thousands of India-based entities, including the Missionaries of Charity. An examination of facts would make it clear that no single community, religion or source of funding has been particularly ‘targeted’ or any accounts frozen by the government of India. All these applications for renewal of FCRA licences have been processed as per well-established procedure," the statement said.

"On 22/12/2021 militants targeted and killed a property dealer, Rauf Ahmed, in Safakadal area. After the incident the Srinagar police started investigating this killing. During the course of the investigation the movement of some suspects was detected in Srinagar city," a police statement said. "Based on further analysis and credible human intelligencewp, the Srinagar police detected suspicious movement of militants in Bhagat Barzulla area and, along with the CRPF, laid special nakas and apprehended two militants of the banned militant organisation TRF/MGH, offshoots of LeT and JeM, near Barzulla Bridge," the statement read. Identifying the arrested militants as Suhail Qadir Khanday of Tral Pulwama and Suhail Mushtaq Waza, resident of Nikloora in Pulwama, both active, the spokesperson said two pistols, two pistol magazines and 30 pistol bullets were initially recovered from the spot. "On further questioning of the militants, incriminating material, arms and ammunition — including 2 pistols, 6 pistol magazines, 69 rounds, and two pistol silencers have been recovered from their hideout in Srinagar city. So far, four pistols, eight pistol magazines, 99 live rounds and two pistol silencers have been recovered in the case," the statement read. "They identified two associates — Basit Bilal Makaya , a resident of Qamar Abad Qamarwari, and Naikoo Imad Nasar, resident of Kiloora Shopian — who were operating with them as OGWs," the police spokesperson said. A case under FIR No. 08/2021 has been registered at Saddar Police Station under sections of the Arms Act and UAPA Act, the spokesperson said. The police spokesperson added that "during questioning the arrested militants disclosed that they were operating in Srinagar city on the directions of one person, Asif Maqbool Dar, resident of MIG Colony Bemina, at present in Dammam, Saudi Arabia, and Sajjad Gul, resident of HMT Parimpora, at present in Pakistan". "… the handlers from Saudi Arabia and Pakistan were providing weapons and money through a network of OGWs (that are) being identified. This module has also done a recce of security installations like the NIA office, Delhi police headquarters, etc., and shared the same with their handlers in Pakistan," the spokesperson said. "As per the investigation the targets in the city for killings were also selected and conveyed to them by Dr Asif Dar and Sajjad Gul. Suhail Qadar Khandy was working in Saudi Arabia with Dr Asif Dar and, in August 2021, on the direction of Dr Dar, he came back and started working as an operative of TRF/MGH for coordinating the collection of arms and ammunition, money and militant attacks in Srinagar," the statement read. Meanwhile, IGP (Kashmir) Vijay Kumar said there were "already three more case FIRs registered against Dr Asif Dar in Srinagar for using provocative language to invoke disaffection against government establishments" and "promoting enmity between different groups". He said it was for the first time that "Dr Asif was found directly involved in militancy in Kashmir".||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/2-let-jem-terrorists-2-associates-arrested-for-killing-of-srinagar-property-dealer/articleshow/88742418.cms||M Saleem Pandit

Another major observation by the experts is that the chest CT scan reports are also showing normal results in most patients affected by the virus this time. Covid-19 task force member Dr Shashank Joshi told TOI, “A significant difference between the current Covid surge and the Delta wave is that the former has in most cases mainly upper respiratory tract symptoms with fever duration much shorter, sometimes as short as 72 hours. Delta was associated with high-grade fever stretching over a long time.” Dr Joshi said clinical features of Omicron (from the cases seen in the past three weeks) were painful/ burning/ sore /scratchy throat, fever, headache or body ache, cough (occasionally productive), stuffy nose, nausea or bloating, myalgia and persistent fatigue lasting for two to five days. Dr Vasant Nagvekar, consultant (infectious diseases) and a member of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force, said, “Though chest CT scans are not advisable for the mild Covid patients, results of 90-95% of those opting for the test are normal. During the Delta wave, chest CT scan results of a majority of the moderate to severe patients were abnormal. The current surge is suggesting mild upper respiratory illness with fever lasting for 48-72 hours.” Dr Nagvekar added that at his hospital, none of the Covid patients was currently on oxygen support. Dr Zirpe said in the current surge, the patients were witnessing one or two spikes in fever, and that too low grade fever around 99-100°F, which settles down in two to three days.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/covid-duration-of-fever-in-current-surge-shorter-say-experts/articleshow/88743154.cms||Neha Madaan
---||---||Election Commission advisory may push for self-restraint from parties||NEW DELHI: Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan, who was called by the Election Commission (EC) on Thursday for a fresh update on the Covid situation as well as vaccination status in the five poll-bound states, is said to have ruled out any cause for alarm or concern because of “very few” cases of Omicron infection.  The expert assessment, sources told TOI, has cleared the way for the EC to go ahead with announcement of polls, while putting in place a protocol to ensure proper adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour during campaigning and conduct of poll.  During the commission’s meeting with the health secretary, also attended by AIIMS director Randeep Guleria and ICMR chief Balram Bhargava, a complete review was done on current Covid infection status and inputs of the medical experts were taken on the safety measures to be ensured during the election process. Guleria and Bhargava were also consulted by the EC on medical symptoms associated with infected patients and their recovery graph.  According to sources, Bhushan told the EC that not only were the Omicron cases very limited in the five states, but even the weekly positivity rate was low at 0.24%-2.1%. Also, the vaccination rate was up since the health secretary last met the EC on December 27, 2021.  As per latest data shared by the health ministry, Uttar Pradesh has a weekly positivity rate of 0.24%, 88% first dose coverage and 52% second dose coverage. Punjab has a weekly positivity rate of 2.1%, with 76% coverage of first dose and 42% of second dose. Uttarakhand weekly positivity rate stands at 1.01%, and it already has 98% of its population covered by first dose and 81% by second dose. Goa has the highest first dose vaccination rate of 113% (due to outsiders getting the vaccine in Goa) and its second dose coverage too totals 96%. Manipur, however, remains a cause for concern for the EC with its 57% first dose coverage and 43% second dose coverage, even though its weekly positivity rate is low at 1.1%.  The EC has asked the health secretary to ensure that vaccination coverage is pushed up further in states like Manipur, Punjab and UP.  The EC on Thursday also met home secretary Ajay Bhalla to discuss the law and order situation in the five poll-bound states and deployment of central paramilitary forces. As many as one lakh central paramilitary and state armed police personnel may watch over the UP polls that could stretch to seven-eight phases.  TOI has learnt that physical poll rallies may be allowed with stricter curbs, given the assessment of “non-alarming” situation in the poll-bound states shared by the health ministry.  Among the possibilities being examined by the poll panel are banning public meetings in closed spaces. Even the rallies that may be permitted on open grounds will have to follow tighter norms with a cap on the number of attendees.  Sources said the EC will issue an advisory to the political parties seeking self-restraint on their part while campaigning and requesting them to switch to virtual campaign as far as possible. Roadshows may be banned.  The EC sources also said that it will make the state disaster management agency (SDMA) responsible for enforcing Covid-appropriate behaviour and curbs. The commission will also fix responsibility on the district election officer concerned in the event of a major violation of Covid norms and take strict action, including removal of the errant officer from duty and even suspension. Candidates and star campaigners at whose rallies norms are violated may also face cancellation of their future rallies.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/election-commission-advisory-may-push-for-self-restraint-from-parties/articleshow/88757056.cms||Bharti Jain

Compared to a peak demand of around 3,000 MT a day during the first wave in 2020, demand had soared to over 9,000 MT when the Delta variant took a severe toll. “It was a highly commendable effort by my predecessors and the industry, which worked together. This kind of a response was difficult in the developed world and production was ramped up from around 1,000 MT a day to 9,000 MT,” said Anurag Jain, secretary in the department for promotion of industry and internal trade. The heavy demand for oxygen, which was seen to be a key reason for a large number of deaths due to an unprecedented wave of infections, saw the government invest heavily in creating capacity, including setting up of plants in hospitals across the country. A panel under NITI Aayog member VK Paul had asked the government to be prepared to supply 17,000-18,000 MT of oxygen in case of a third wave. Jain said that experience in other countries suggests that Omicron patients did not require oxygen support or ICU beds in large numbers. Currently, demand is estimated at around 1,600 MT a day. “The system is ready. If needed, we can meet demand up to 19,000 MT,” Jain said, adding that the PSA plants set up using funds from PM Cares and budgetary support from the Centre and the states alone are capable of supplying nearly 4,000 MT a day.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/medical-oxygen-output-ramped-up-to-meet-daily-demand-of-19000-metric-tonnes-government/articleshow/88743319.cms||---

India had last recorded 1 lakh new infections in a day on June 6, 2021 — 214 days ago — when the second pandemic wave was on the wane. On Thursday, the tally of fresh cases swelled to nearly 1,17,000 (116,964, with one state yet to report), as per TOI’s Covid database. On Wednesday, India had reported 90,889 new cases. A similar rise in daily Covid numbers — from 10,000 to 1 lakh — had taken 103 days during the first wave of the pandemic in India (when cases peaked at 98,795) and 47 days during the second wave. So, the current rate of growth appears to be five times faster than it was at the beginning of the second wave, which peaked at over 4 lakh daily cases.

The Congress government in Punjab instituted a separate inquiry headed by a former acting chief justice of the high court into the alleged breach of security protocol, leading to PM Modi skipping his scheduled BJP rally there. Read Also'PM Modi's road journey started after Punjab DGP clearance'NEW DELHI: Not only was the contingency plan for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's road journey from Bathinda to Ferozepur discussed in detail with the Punjab administration and police during the advance security liaison (ASL) meetings conducted by SPG on January 1 and 2, but the final decision toThe Supreme Court also took note of the gravity of the alleged breach and agreed to hear on Friday a PIL seeking a fair probe into the incident to fix accountability of the state government, top bureaucracy and police. The committee led by cabinet secretariat official Sudhir Kumar Saxena includes Intelligence Bureau joint director Balbir Singh and inspector general S Suresh of the SPG. The panel has been advised to submit the report at the earliest, the MHA said. Read AlsoPresident Ram Nath Kovind expresses concern as PM Modi gives first-hand account of security breachNEW DELHI: Displaying solidarity with PM Narendra Modi and making a political statement on the security breach during his Punjab visit on Wednesday, BJP leaders tweeted pictures of the PM at Kedarnath with a "long live Modiji" message while several, including Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Chouhan, heldPunjab has asked the probe panel led by Justice Mehtab Singh Gill (retd) to submit its report within three days. Principal secretary Anurag Verma of the home affairs and justice department is part of it. Central government officials alleged that what was witnessed on the flyover was "a surprising scene of connivance between Punjab Police and so-called protesters" as only state police were aware of the PM's precise route. "Never has such police behaviour been witnessed. This is the single biggest lapse in security of any Indian PM in recent years," a senior official said. The MHA had said on Wednesday that the PM’s schedule and travel plans were communicated well in advance to the Punjab government. "As per procedure, they have to make the necessary arrangements for logistics, security as well as keep a contingency plan ready. Also, in view of the contingency plan, the Punjab government has to deploy additional security to secure any movement by road, which were clearly not deployed," it said. Retired judge Gill, who is currently the state's chief vigilance commissioner, told TOI it was "a very serious matter" that the PM's convoy got stuck. "What has been done is not acceptable, and we will fix responsibility (for it) at the earliest." Shortly after setting up the inquiry in accordance with the MHA's directive, CM Charanjit Singh Channi maintained there was no laxity on the state government's part and accused PM Modi of trying to defame Punjab with his "main zinda wapas ja raha hoon (am going back alive)" remark. Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu termed the episode "a conspiracy to deflect attention from issues of Punjab in the name of national security". He claimed attendance at BJP's rally in Ferozepur was only around 500, which is why the PM turned back. "They are now trying to divide us, but we Punjabis and Sikhs, in particular, are sons of the Gurus and will remain united," Sidhu said at a rally in Barnala. The PM was stuck on a flyover near Piareana village on the Moga-Ferozepur route because of a blockade by farmers participating in the #ModiGoBack campaign started by farm groups demanding a legal guarantee on MSP, among other things. He was visiting Punjab after a gap of two years since his last trip to inaugurate projects cumulatively worth Rs 42,750 crore. The state probe panel's brief is to investigate why the police administration failed to ensure smooth movement of PM Modi's convoy despite clear advance instructions from the police headquarters. ADGP (law and order) Naresh Kumar Arora had on January 4 written to all commissioners of police, SSPs, IGs, and DIGs of all ranges to make appropriate security and route arrangements in their respective districts for the PM's January 5 rally. "You are further directed to keep a watch on the movement of farmers and they should not be allowed to move to district Ferozepur to disrupt the rally. Any dharna may result in roadblocks, therefore, please make necessary traffic diversion plan in advance," reads the communication. In an earlier communication to all the commissioners and SSPs on January 2, the AIG (law and order) had informed them that a one-lakh-strong crowd was being mobilised for Modi's rally.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mha-punjab-to-separately-probe-pm-modi-visit-security-lapse/articleshow/88743383.cms||---

As per the SPG Blue Book, the overall responsibility for ensuring safety of the PM rests with the state government and the DGP is responsible for implementation of the rules. The details discussed with the Punjab administration and police during the ASL meetings on January 1 and 2 covered route survey and identification of vulnerable points to be secured with strong police deployment, in view of intelligence inputs regarding possibilities of disruptions. In fact, a contingency rehearsal was also carried out on January 4 for the journey, according to sources in the Centre. A source said the Punjab police was fully aware of the threats faced by Modi, with their internal documents and communications about securing the roads for the PM's visit mentioning a traffic diversion plan in advance, as "dharna may result in roadblock". A special mention exists in the internal communication of the Punjab police to keep a watch on the movement of farmers and stopping them from going to Ferozepur to disrupt the PM's rally. The events of January 1, 2 and 4, run counter to the Punjab government's claim that it was not kept in the loop on the PM's contingency road journey. Sources in the Centre also ruled out the Punjab police being unaware of any "sudden change of plan" from helicopter journey from Bathinda to Ferozepur to a road journey. An officer said that when the helicopter journey was not possible, SPG director discussed with the Punjab DGP the possibility of the PM undertaking a safe and secure road journey from Bathinda to Ferozepur. It was only after getting the DGP's clearance that the road journey was planned. Officers of SPG had multiple conversations from DGP Punjab regarding the road journey, with SSP Bathinda piloting the motorcade from Bathinda to Ferozepur district and SSP Ferozepur piloting from the Ferozepur district border. Also faulting the Punjab police and administration for doing a shoddy job, a central government official said the police control room failed to inform the pilot of the motorcade about some so-called protestors on the PM’s route.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modis-road-journey-started-after-punjab-dgp-clearance/articleshow/88743506.cms||---
---||India||President Ram Nath Kovind expresses concern as PM Modi gives first-hand account of security breach||NEW DELHI: Displaying solidarity with PM Narendra Modi and making a political statement on the security breach during his Punjab visit on Wednesday, BJP leaders tweeted pictures of the PM at Kedarnath with a "long live Modiji" message while several, including Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Chouhan, held pujas for his well-being. Ministers like Piyush Goyal and Bhupendra Yadav tweeted the Kedarnath pictures while many others referred to the PM calling on President Ram Nath Kovind and giving an account of the security breach in his convoy during his visit to Punjab. He spoke of the President offering his concern and best wishes.  BJP clearly viewed the unprecedented lapse that saw the PM stuck on a flyover for 20 minutes as a very serious matter, given the Punjab administration and police being responsible for the arrangements and also took note of the disparaging tone of Congress's statements as something that needed vigorous rebuttal. There was concern that the incident could be replicated elsewhere and strong signal of disapproval needed to be sent out. While Kovind expressed concern about the serious security lapse, Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu spoke to Modi and suggested stringent measures be taken to adhere to established security protocol. Amidst exchange of allegations among political parties, government sources released a detailed account of how the PM's security protocol was compromised despite timely communication to the Punjab police about his schedule and subsequent changes. "President Ram Nath Kovind met PM Modi at the Rashtrapati Bhavan today and received from him a first-hand account of the security breach in his convoy in Punjab. The President expressed his concerns about the serious lapse," the Rashtrapati Bhavan tweeted. The PM also tweeted, saying, "Called on Rashtrapati Ji. Thankful to him for his concern. Grateful for his good wishes, which are always a source of strength." Sources said Naidu expressed deep concern and hoped that stringent steps will be taken to scrupulously adhere to established security protocol and ensure such situation doesn't recur in future. At the Cabinet meeting on Thursday, most of the ministers expressed anguish and concern over the incident in Punjab posing a serious security threat to the PM, while he was on his way to Ferozepur by road after his chopper could not take off due to bad weather. Seeking blessings for the PM's long life, Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath performed puja at Kashi Vishwanath Temple in Varanasi, the Lok Sabha constituency of Modi, whereas Chouhan performed "Mahamrityunjaya Jaap". BJP secretary Tarun Chugh alleged that the Channi government joined hands with anti-national elements to sabotage PM Modi's visit to Punjab. "The Congress government at the behest of Sonia Gandhi engineered a grave threat to the life of the PM," he added. While Congress issued a statement saying the matter was serious, former PM HD Deve Gowda, several CMs, including Navin Patnaik and Uddhav Thackeray, expressed concern over the incident and suggested a high level inquiry.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/president-ram-nath-kovind-expresses-concern-as-pm-modi-gives-first-hand-account-of-security-breach/articleshow/88743567.cms||---
---||India||Instead of ‘antics’, China should settle LAC issues: MEA||NEW DELHI: In strong rebuttals of recent Chinese actions, India on Thursday slammed Beijing for renaming of places in Arunachal Pradesh, saying instead of such antics it should settle issues on the western LAC, and also said that reports of the PLA's construction of a bridge over Pangong Tso, east of the LAC, were being monitored to ensure India’s security interests were safe. Asking Beijing to focus on resolving the standoff in remaining areas at the LAC along the western sector, the government also described a letter by a Chinese diplomat to Indian MPs expressing reservations over their presence at a Tibet-related event as inappropriate, a clear red rag for the Chinese government. India asked Beijing to not complicate the situation further by “hyping” normal activities by MPs in a “vibrant democracy”. In its first reaction to the Pangong bridge issue, the government said India remained committed to improving border infrastructure and providing logistical support to its armed forces. “Calling Tuting as DouDeng or River Siyom as XiYueMu or even Kibithu as Daba does not alter the fact that Arunachal Pradesh has always been and will always remain an inalienable part of India,” said MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi, adding that the Chinese exercise was ridiculous and meant to support untenable territorial claims. “We hope that instead of engaging in such antics China will work constructively with us to resolve the outstanding friction points in areas along the western sector of the LAC in India-China border areas," he added. Asked about the images of Chinese soldiers unfurling the Chinese flag in the Galwan valley, the official said Indian media had already released images contradicting the claims made by Chinese media. On reports about a bridge being constructed by China on the Pangong lake, the official said this was being done in areas that had been under illegal occupation by China for 60 years now. “As you are well aware, India has never accepted such illegal occupation,” he said. Separately, the official further added, India had been taking all necessary steps to ensure that its security interests are fully protected. “As part of these efforts, government has also, in the last seven years, increased significantly the budget for development of border infrastructure and completed more roads and bridges than ever before. These have provided much-needed connectivity to local population as well as logistical support to armed forces. Government remains committed to this objective,” he said. Asked about reports that the political counsellor at the Chinese embassy wrote letters to MPs objecting to their participation in an event about Tibet, the official said the substance, tone and tenor of the letter were inappropriate. “Chinese side should note that India is a vibrant democracy and Hon’ble MPs, as representatives of the people, undertake activities as per their views and beliefs,” he said. “We expect the Chinese side to refrain from hyping normal activities by honourable MPs and complicate further the situation in our bilateral relations,” Bagchi added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/instead-of-antics-china-should-settle-lac-issues-mea/articleshow/88743619.cms||---
---||India||Medical admission delay: SC 'shares' concern, quota ruling today||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday will pronounce its decision on the inclusion of 27% OBC and 10% EWS quota in medical admissions, just 16 hours after it reserved verdict on petitions challenging the extension of these two quotas for NEET-PG admissions for 2021-22 academic session. The Centre on Thursday told the Supreme Court that admissions to central educational institutions had provision for 27% OBC quota since 2006 and EWS quota for more than two years and argued that it is incorrect on the part of petitioners to accuse the government of changing the rules of the game mid-way by extending these reservations to medical admissions for 2021-22. After hearing the petitioners who have challenged the two quotas in medical admission and solicitor general Tushar Mehta who proposed early resumption of stalled medical counselling for undergraduate and PG medical courses, a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and A S Bopanna reserved judgment at 4.30 pm on Thursday. The judgment, to be pronounced at 10.30 am on Friday, will allow early resumption of counselling for medical seats with or without the quotas. Meeting head on a fusillade of charges from counsel for petitioners questioning the rationality of extending OBC and EWS quota to medical admission, Mehta said that providing reservation to socially and economically backward classes — OBC and EWS — is constitutionally imperative and the SC in a string of judgments more than a decade ago has upheld this view. He said the government respects the SC's consistent rulings against reservation in super-speciality courses and that NEET-PG is not a super-speciality course. The focus of the arguments by petitioners was against inclusion of 10% EWS quota and the Rs 8 lakh annual income criteria for the purpose. Extricating the government from a difficult situation, in which the bench repeatedly questioned the rationale behind the income benchmark, Mehta said the EWS income criteria is very different from the income criteria of Rs 8 lakh fixed for weeding out creamy layer from cornering benefits of the OBC quota. Picking up from the arguments of senior advocate Arvind Datar, the bench asked whether Rs 5 lakh annual income would be a reasonable benchmark for EWS category. Mehta said while the Rs 8 lakh annual income for OBC is computed individually on the basis of earnings in the past three years, for the EWS category the income is total household income for the past year. Moreover, possession of five acres of land would disqualify one to be categorised under EWS quota. However, he said the Ajay Bhushan Pandey committee recommendations, accepted by the Centre, tweaking the existing EWS criteria would be applicable from next year. He said changing the EWS income criteria for admissions to the 2021-22 academic session would further delay the admissions and cause shortage of resident doctors. Appearing for Federation of Resident Doctors Association (FORDA), advocate Archana Pathak Dave said because of the delay in PG admissions, the resident doctors’ strength has declined to almost one-third, forcing them to work very long hours at a time when there is a third surge of Covid patients. The bench said, “It is a genuine concern of not only the resident doctors but the entire citizenry. Your concern is well taken and shared by the Supreme Court.” After the SG explained the difficulties that would be faced by EWS candidates if the criteria were tweaked, the bench said, “We understand why the Pandey committee and the Centre is saying the tweaked norms would come into force from next year.” The SG also said that the Supreme Court has consistently ruled just because an alternative view is possible, the court cannot substitute the Union government’s well-considered decision with its own view. The SC can always strike down a decision if it is not in consonance with the mandate or provisions of the Constitution, he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/medical-admission-delay-sc-shares-concern-quota-ruling-today/articleshow/88743666.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

"These two budgets proposed development projects worth Rs 10,000 crore, but only 20% of the proposals are in the implementation stage," said a senior BBMP official.The cabinet, at its meeting, also gave its in-principle approval for projects to decongest roads connecting Kempegowda International Airport and Tumakuru. The projects include constructing a four-lane flyover parallel to the existing flyover on the airport road from Hebbal. While three lanes of the flyover (to come up on the west side of the existing one) will be dedicated to airport-bound vehicles, one lane will merge into Tumakuru road.The proposal includes construction of a three-lane flyover on the east of the existing Hebbal flyover to decongest the junction. Another two-lane flyover proposed from KR Puram to Hebbal will merge into the new flyover. "Once all these projects are realised, we'll have a 10-lane road to the airport from the city," Madhuswamy said.These projects are planned jointly by BBMP, BDA, BMTC, Bescom and KRiDE keeping in mind the traffic volume expected by 2050. "The cost and other details are yet to be worked out. We've asked officials to prepare a detailed report," he said.The cabinet gave approval for taking up development works in urban local bodies at a cost of Rs 3,885 crore over the next five years. "Under this programme, Grade I corporations will get Rs 40 crore each, Grade II Rs 30 crore each, municipal councils Rs 10 crore each, and town panchayats will get Rs 5 crore each," Madhuswamy said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/eye-on-bbmp-polls-cabinet-clears-6k-cr-for-bengaluru-infra/articleshow/88743685.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Survey: 46% Bengaluru rural kids exposed to Covid-19||BENGALURU: A seroprevalence study conducted in Bengaluru Rural district in June-July last year has shown that 46% of children in the 0-18 age group have been exposed to Covid-19. Researchers from Bangalore Baptist Hospital conducted the study between June 14 and July 13 with healthcare workers doing a house-to-house survey as the second Covid wave was ebbing in the state. With their consent, the survey was conducted on 213 boys and 199 girls in Doddaballapura and Devanahalli taluks, where Baptist hospital has its centres. The researchers have submitted the study — ‘Covid serosurvey among children after the second surge in a rural district of South India' — to PLOS One, an international scientific journal, for publication. "The study's findings are a relief. Even though vaccination in children is still in its early phase in India, most children would have had an exposure to Covid (asymptomatic infection) and have developed antibodies," said Dr Caroline Elizabeth George, head, community health, Bangalore Baptist Hospital, who led the survey. As per the study data available with TOI, the seroprevalence was highest in the age group of 0-6 years at 57.8%. While 50.4% in the age group of 11-15 years showed antibody presence, 43.6% from the age group of 16-18 years and 35.9% in the age group of 6-10 years had antibodies. Dr George said results of seroprevalence among the adults done around the same time (two weeks prior to that of children) had showed 62% of the adults had developed antibodies against SARS-CoV2. "In the studied cohort, almost one in two children had developed Covid antibodies by June-July 2021. Most of the children would have had asymptomatic infection. Some of them may have had mild infection, but they didn't have enough symptoms to get tested. None was tested for Covid," said Dr George. In June 2021, a high-level expert committee for prevention and management of the third wave, headed by Dr Devi Shetty, had recommended to the state government to conduct sero-surveillance study for analysing seroprevalence in the 0-18 age-group in the state. This was suggested by the technical expert committee, too. However, the state's health and family welfare department has not taken it up yet.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/survey-46-bluru-rural-kids-exposed-to-covid-19/articleshow/88743691.cms||Sunitha Rao R
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu govt mulls transfer of governor’s power to appoint vice-chancellors to CM||CHENNAI: The Tamil Nadu government is considering enabling the chief minister to appoint vice-chancellors — a power now vested with the governor who is also the chancellor of state-run universities. The government is consulting legal experts in this regard. In the assembly on Thursday, chief minister M K Stalin said the government may introduce a resolution on the matter during the upcoming budget session. PMK floor leader G K Mani, while participating in the debate on the thanksgiving motion on governor's speech, said there were many issues concerning universities including delay in appointments of VCs. He advocated for appointment of VCs by the chief minister himself. It would put an end to the issues surrounding appointments of VCs in state universities, he said. The CM was in discussions with experts to take over powers of governor in appointment of VCs, higher education minister K Ponmudi said, adding that governments appoint VCs in many states. "I would like to inform the BJP members (here) that even in Gujarat, where our PM Narendra Modi served as chief minister earlier, the CM has been appointing VCs since 1949," Ponmudi said. "Our PM is aware of it. You (BJP MLAs) can take this to the notice of the PM," Ponmudi said. He pointed out that the Maharashtra government introduced an amendment (the Maharashtra Public University Act 2016) to empower itself to appoint VCs.After a tussle between West Bengal government and the state's governor, the government appointed a vice-chancellor recently. Similar tussle is going on in neighbouring Kerala too. "To resolve such issues, state governments should have powers to appoint VCs. Our CM feels so. Before the next assembly session, a decision will be taken," he said. Intervening at this stage, Stalin said the government would pass a resolution in the assembly in this regard. The PMK and MNM welcomed the CM's announcement. Actor-turned-political Kamal Haasan's Makkal Needhi Maiyam welcomed CM's announcement. The party had issued a statement saying the government should appoint VCs instead of governor. PMK youth wing leader and Rajya Sabha MP Anbumani Ramadoss welcomed CM's announcement and noted that his party general body had adopted such a resolution recently. He tweeted that the PMK would support the government's initiative. Since R N Ravi assumed office as governor in September last year, he had called meetings of VCs to discuss university issues. The government was not comfortable with such meetings as Ravi had apparently asked VCs to implement the national education policy.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/tn-mulls-transfer-of-guvs-power-to-appoint-vcs-to-cm/articleshow/88743720.cms||Shanmughasundaram J

The beleaguered PSU has been informed by the state revenue department in December that the land parcels, located in such premium commercial and residential localities like Egmore, Flower Bazaar, Triplicane, Royapettah and Vyasarpadi and suburban areas like Ennore, Ambattur and Chengalpet town could not be ‘monetised' without the consent of the Tamil Nadu government. BSNL has identified eight prime properties for sale in the first phase. The revenue objection was raised when the BSNL officials approached the former for patta transfer-related issue. While the title for most of the land parcels that were given by the Tamil Nadu government to the department of telecom (DoT) in the past were transferred in the name of BSNL, there were certain problems in ‘pattas' of a few land parcels. Since these lands were originally acquired by the state government and allotted to the department of telecom for a specific purpose, the assets could not be sold or used for any other purpose, the state has reasoned.The development comes days after Tamil Nadu finance minister PTR Palanivel Thiaga Rajan highlighted the rights of the state government over such properties when they are being privatised by the Union government. However, C K Mathivanan, senior vice-president of the national federation of telecom employees, said post-monetisation, BSNL was likely to utilise the resources only for improving its infrastructure.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/tn-red-flags-bsnls-1250cr-city-asset-monetisation-plan/articleshow/88743723.cms||Yogesh Kabirdoss

The temple won the Unesco world heritage monument tag last year. The Centre in its affidavit filed before the high court said the state was yet to form the Palampet Special Area Development Authority and even the neighbouring two temples along with their land have not been transferred to the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) to enable it to create a buffer zone. "Even the work to protect the temple architecture and lake around Ramappa temple has not been initiated," assistant solicitor general Namavarapu Rajeswara Rao said. "The state is contending that this will be done by the Palampet special authority once it is constituted in September 2022. That is just two months before the WHC deadline,"the ASG said in his status report furnished to the HC. "It is extremely important to develop the vicinity and protect the temple along with its heritage to retain the prestigious world heritage status of the temple," ASG Rao said in his report. Last year, as per the suggestion made by the Telangana HC, the state and Centre had formed a joint committee to develop the temple and make it compliant with the WHC norms. Briefing the HC about the work so far, the ASG said the director-general of ASI had held a virtual meeting on December 16 last year with various state and central authorities. The state was asked to speed up the process of setting up a separate development authority at Palampet where the temple is located. The ASI said it was worried about the huge time being taken by the state to form the Palampet special authority and requested the state to allow the Kakatiya Heritage Trust along with conservation consultant to prepare a heritage inventory in the meantime. Both the Centre and state have to jointly convey the status on the status to the WHC by December 1, 2022. A bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Abhinand Kumar Shavili adjourned the case to June 9.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/centre-blames-state-in-hc-for-delay-in-ramappa-renovation/articleshow/88743726.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha
---||Gurgaon||How evening curbs have hit livelihood of traders in Gurugram||GURUGRAM: The new restrictions on the timings of the local markets announced by the state government on Wednesday, have disrupted the businesses of local traders, hotels, and mall owners, just like in 2020. According to a study by Gurugram Nagrik Ekta Manch, 90% of the daily wagers and 44% of street vendors and stall owners were left with less than Rs 500 at that time. Now, in markets like Sadar Bazaar and sectors 14 and 15 of the city, popular vendors have gone missing and some are preparing to shut their stalls down. A food vendor in Patel Nagar informed that two popular food stall owners have disappeared overnight. “One of them has left for their hometown and the other may also be leaving soon. Firstly, there is a fear of lockdown. Secondly, earnings have dropped by 50%. So, it’s becoming difficult to live in the city. I too might leave soon or rent out my stall to somebody because I’m unable to even meet the expenses for the raw material,” he said. Meanwhile, 40-year-old Rakesh Singh, a migrant from UP said, “I have to sell or rent out my stall now because there’s no way I can make use of it. I work as a guard in a public sector bank. Normally, I would finish my duty by 5pm and open my food stall by 6.30pm.” Further, commercial establishments have also complained about a drastic dip in their revenues due to the government’s directives to close the market by 6pm. Shopkeepers, hoteliers, and mall owners are disappointed that the authorities start shutting down the markets an hour before the curfew time, leaving them no window to generate business during their "golden hour," i.e. 5-9 pm. Traders in local markets rue that they are staring at over 50% losses. “Majority of the people go shopping late in the evening and that’s the period where businesses see maximum activities. All that has stopped. If it continues like this for a few more weeks, people will have to brace for permanent closure of shops,” argued Sector 22 Market Association president, Rakesh Mallik. Malls have also noted a decrease of 20-40% in footfall. Hoteliers too said closing down of markets by 6pm has lowered their businesses by 80%. “Keeping hotels open till 11pm, while markets are shut, doesn’t help at all. Even though the government has given a relaxation of one hour, it will hardly provide any relief to anybody,” said Vishal Anand, head of National Restaurant Association of India (Gurugram chapter).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/how-evening-curbs-have-hit-livelihood-of-traders-in-city/articleshow/88743735.cms||Siddharth Tiwari
---||Gurgaon||Gurugram: 9 illegal colonies came up in 6 months, 58 builders face FIR||GURUGRAM: The department of town and country planning (DTCP) has written to Gurugram police to register FIR against 58 offenders who allegedly carved out nine illegal colonies on 32.5 acre land in and around the city in the last six months. Out of the nine police complaints against the offenders, three have been filed at Sector 10A, five at Farrukhnagar and one at Rajendra Park police stations. These illegal colonies covering two to eight acres have come up at Sultanpur, Gadoli Kalan, Farrukhnagar, Garhi Harsaru and Kherki Mazra in the last few months, police said. Around 20 acre land in Sultanpur was developed into four illegal colonies by the offenders. The colonies were developed on land pieces measuring 2.5 acres to eight acres. The department, after serving show cause notices and restoration orders, has now recommended for FIR against 20 people at Farrukhnagar police station. In Gadoli Kalan and Garhi Harsaru, three illegal colonies on over six acre agricultural land were carved out by the offenders. The department has written to Sector 10A police to register FIR against 27 people. Similarly in Kherki Mazra, five offenders had carved out illegal colony on two acre land. The department has written to Rajendra Park police to register FIR against the developers. Another four-acre illegal colony was developed by six offenders in Farrukhnagar, the department has written to Farrukhnagar police to register FIR against them. As per DTCP compliant, the land falls within Urban Area limit of Gurugram. "The Section 3 of Act no. 8 of 1975, provides that the land owner shall get a licence before carving out a colony within Urban Area from the competent authority. Section 7 (i) of Act of 1975 prohibits sub division intention to sub division of land for carving out the colony. Section 7 (ii) prohibits construction in a colony for which license under section 3 of Act of 1975 has not been granted" the complaint reads. District town planner (enforcement) RS Batth said, “The offenders have violated the norms by sub-dividing land for the purpose of colony. The offenders are deliberately continuing with the contravention of provision of Act of 1975 and rules.” He said contravention/violation of section 3, 7(i), 7 (ii) of Act of 1975 and rules framed is a punishable offence with imprisonment up to 3 years, therefore, police should stop the development of colonies immediately, investigate the matter and register a FIR against the offenders (both developer and as well as land owners) as well as others whose name gets associated with the above referred offence during the course of investigation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/9-illegal-colonies-came-up-in-6-mths-58-builders-face-fir/articleshow/88743737.cms||Rao Jaswant Singh

Unavailability of teachers, the petitioner said, was affecting the education of his 13-year-old daughter and 129 students enrolled at the school.The petitioner, 36-year-old Isab Khan, said the school has been running with just one teacher for several years and this has been hampering the education of his daughter and other girls who study there. After several rounds of meetings with the local administration failed to yield results, Khan said he was forced to take legal recourse.Himself a teacher, who runs an educational institute for primary school students, Khan said, “Mewat (Nuh) has continued to remain backward because there is no access to proper education. Either there are no teachers or no buildings to accommodate students. The authorities think that people don’t want to educate their children but that is not true. I have dreams for my three daughters.”In his petition, Khan has named the Haryana chief secretary, Nuh’s district education officer and principal of Biwan’s Government Middle School for Girls as defendants. A local court admitted his petition on December 21, 2021, and summoned officials from the education department to respond to it. The next hearing is scheduled on January 20.In his petition, Khan stated that there was “only one teacher for the last several years in the school for the education of 130 students of classes VI to VIII”.While the block education officer Inderjit Singh declined to comment on the matter, the cluster head of the block, Hakim, admitted all the 14 schools, including the Biwan middle school, under his jurisdiction, are facing a shortage of teachers and staff members. “Especially the six middle schools in the block have only one teacher. We have raised the matter time and again with higher authorities, but there has been no concrete response to our pleas,” Hakim said.“The problem aggravates as teachers from outside Mewat are not willing to teach here and the government doesn’t want to do anything about it,” he added.The issue of shortage of teachers was recently discussed in the Vidhan Sabha and it was mentioned that there is a shortage of 40,000 teachers in around 14,000 government-run schools in Haryana.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/only-1-teacher-in-daughters-school-father-moves-court/articleshow/88743739.cms||Sagrika Kissu

These incident commanders will be responsible to monitor containment zones and have been directed to ensure that the rules are properly followed by coordinating with the police and health department.  The teams established by the incident commanders will carry out inspections at markets, private offices, and public places to assure appropriate behaviour. The district is currently witnessing a huge spike with 4,220 active cases. “The administration has constituted a team of incident commanders for their respective areas to ensure preventive guidelines issued by the government are being followed on ground. The team will visit the field and inspect government and private institutions and a penalty will be issued, if anyone is found violating the norms. Challan of Rs. 500 will be issued against individuals and Rs. 5000 for institutional violators. Moreover, they will monitor the containment zones to check the spread of infection,” a senior official of district administration has claimed. An order issued by the District Magistrate, Yash Garg, stated that in view of the Covid's third wave, Gurugram has been declared as a sensitive area and therefore it is necessary to appoint the incident commanders for appropriate management in different areas of the district. Ankita Choudhary (SDM) has been designated in-charge of the Gurugram sub-division and rural area while Jitender Kumar Garg and Pardeep Kumar are in-charge of Sohna and Pataudi sub-divisions, respectively. Sumit Kumar will be the incident commander for zone-1, Sanjeev Singla for zone-2, and Satish Yadav for zone-3 and 4. They are the Joint Commissioners of MCG. For the area falling under MCM, Joint Commissioner Brahm Prakash has been given the responsibility.

For this, staff at these premises are to check vaccination certificates of people looking to move within these spaces and regulate entry accordingly.A visit by this correspondent to several of these premises since January 1 showed that by and large, the directions are being at private establishments in the city. Ironically, among the places where this correspondent came across no checks was the main government building in the city – the mini secretariat.At several malls along Golf Course Road as well as MG Road, security personnel at the entrances were stopping people and asking them to display their vaccination certificates before permitting them to enter. Staff who this correspondent spoke to said that, largely, only fully vaccinated persons have been visiting these establishments, as a result of which they have not had to turn away too many people.At Galleria market, where entry is normally unregulated with no guards at the access points, personnel have now been deployed to ensure only fully vaccinated people can enter the precinct. Since security personnel have had to be deployed specifically for this purpose, and the market has multiple entry and exit points, some of those have been blocked to ensure people can only access the market from the points where personnel are deployed.At the branches of multiple banks along MG Road, security guards were seen enquiring about visitors’ vaccination status and asking to see proof before them to enter. The mini secretariat, which houses offices of several government departments as well as senior officials of the district administration, including the deputy commissioner himself was, however, a different story. On Tuesday afternoon, when this correspondent visited the building, a PCR van was patrolling the road outside and a Gurgaon police official was posted outside the main gate. There were no checks of the vaccination status of people walking through the gate. This correspondent was able to enter without being stopped. Entry to the building itself was also unregulated, with people walking in and out without, at any point, being asked to show their vaccination certificates or account for their vaccination status.Later, when TOI asked deputy commissioner Yash Garg about the lack of checks, he said, “We have deployed teams who are supposed to be checking people to ensure only those who are fully vaccinated can enter the building. If they were missing, it means they were absent from duty. We will look into this.”Apart from various establishments, the state guidelines also say auto rickshaw unions are to only allow fully vaccinated persons to avail of their services. This correspondent took a few trips on autos, including from Rajiv Chowk and Galleria Market, but wasn’t asked about her vaccination status by the drivers. At Shankar Chowk, auto driver Suneshwar Yadav, who lives in Nathupur, said he does not insist on asking his customers to show their certificate. “As it is, there are very few customers these days and I cannot afford to refuse them if they are unable to show that they are fully vaccinated. I just take their word if they tell me they are vaccinated,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/-pvt-premises-looking-at-jab-status-free-pass-in-govt-office/articleshow/88743743.cms||Sakshi Dayal
---||Gurgaon||Gurugram: Muslim group goes to cops on FIR, says bid to harass||GURUGRAM: A group of Muslims approached the police on Thursday with a request to quash an FIR filed earlier this week against former Rajya Sabha member Mohammad Adeeb and two others that was based on a complaint from a man associated with the recent spate of protests against namaz in public spaces. The FIR was registered at Sector 40 police station against Adeeb, Abdul Hasim Kashmi and Mufti Mohammad Salim Kashmi after Dinesh Bharti cited a newspaper report to say they had claimed a plot of land – which belongs to the government – as theirs and accused them of instigating riots. The three were booked under sections 153 and 34 (common intention) of the IPC at Sector 40 police station on Tuesday. Mufti Salim, who submitted a complaint against Bharti to the police commissioner, said he came to know about the FIR against him and the others through media reports. “The FIR was filed on the complaint of Dinesh Bharti, who has been booked and sent to jail earlier for disrupting communal harmony and inciting violence in Gurugram,” said Mufti Salim. Adeeb is the face of Gurugram Muslim Council, a group formed by some Muslim residents of the city in the wake of the namaz row. On Wednesday, Adeeb had told TOI he was not even aware of the location of the land in question and the case was filed without any inquiry or investigation. Mufti Salim said he had never made the comments cited by Bharti. “I have neither issued any such statement to the newspaper nor in the public domain that a mosque will be built in Sector 40,” he said, adding that intent of the complaint was to harass him. He accused Bharti of misusing the government machinery against him. Police confirmed receiving the complaint. “We will look into it,” said a senior police officer. Adeeb had said he would move court to get the FIR quashed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/muslim-group-goes-to-cops-on-fir-says-bid-to-harass/articleshow/88743745.cms||---

---||Gurgaon||Hospital stay shorter so far in current wave of Covid-19 cases: Doctors||GURUGRAM: As Covid infections being reported daily jump every 24 hours, the number of patients being admitted in hospitals is increasing too, but the overall numbers are still low and the hospital stay is shorter compared to the last two waves because most patients are not getting severe infections, doctors at several private hospitals said. The average stay in hospitals in the city is around four days at present, primarily because most patients don’t have a lung infection, which is in sharp contrast to the second wave in April and May last year. A few patients need oxygen support but ventilator beds have so far not been occupied in the current surge, according to the doctors. They, however, emphasised these are still the early days of the surge, there is no room for complacency, and people must diligently wear masks to thwart the possibility of an infection so that hospitals don’t get overwhelmed with patients. A total of 28 Covid patients are currently admitted in hospitals in Gurugram. One of the hospitalised patients is undergoing bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) treatment, while 10 are on oxygen support. Seventeen more have so far not needed oxygen support. Only one of the hospitalised patients is less than 30 years old. All the rest are 60-plus. Among those who have recovered from the infection after being hospitalised is a 65-year-old man, who was discharged on Thursday. He was admitted to the Covid ward on January 3. He needed oxygen support but was not admitted to the ICU, according to the doctors treating him. He has hypertension and a cardiac ailment. According to experts, CT scans of most patients in the current wave showed no changes in their lungs due to the infection. “There are no changes in the lungs and no respiratory distress. Less than 2% hospitalisation is being witnessed at present. People who are getting hospitalised have cough, cold and severe myalgia (muscle pain),” Gurugram chief medical officer Virender Yadav said. In the first wave, hospitalised patients had high fever with headache, dry cough and severe weakness. Patients with comorbidities also reported respiratory distress. The duration of hospital stay was 10 days on an average and the hospitalisation rate at the peak was 10%. In the second wave, hospitalised patients had high fever with body ache, weakness, dry cough, loss of smell and taste and respiratory distress. The hospitalisation rate was 12% at the peak of the wave and the average length of hospital stay was 14 days. This time, very few Covid patients are in ICUs. “We are seeing an increase in the number of hospitalisations again, but ICU admission is negligible,” said Dr Manoj Goel, director (pulmonology), Fortis Memorial Research Institute.  “The number may possibly rise soon. People may experience the severity of the virus after 10 to 12 days of infection, and may then require hospitalisation,” said Dr Piyush Goel, consultant (pulmonology and critical care) at Manipal Hospitals.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/hospital-stay-shorter-so-far-in-current-wave-of-cases-docs/articleshow/88743751.cms||Ipsita Pati
---||Noida||Noida adds 3.3 lakh voters since 2017 assembly polls||NOIDA: As compared to the assembly elections of 2017, the candidates vying for the three assembly constituencies in Gautam Budh Nagar district will have to put in extra efforts and widen their outreach. More than 3.35 lakh new voters have been added in the voter list this time around. The population of the district now stands at 25.25 lakh out of which 16.24 lakh are eligible to vote. Compared to the Lok Sabha elections that took place in 2019, the latest voters’ list has 82,939 more names while 27,017 have been deleted. The nodal officer for the district, Vandita Srivastava, additional district magistrate (finance and revenue), said that in 2017, a total of 12.88 lakh voters were enrolled for the assembly polls in the state, while for the upcoming elections 16.23 lakh have registered. While the population of voters in Noida has risen from 5.24 lakh to 6.90 lakh, in Dadri it was a 33 percentage increase from 4.41 lakh to 5.87 lakh. The officials added that a significant growth was observed in the Dadri assembly segment, due to several housing projects coming up in Greater Noida West. “We have seen a lot of homebuyers who have taken possession of their flats in the past three to four years. As a result of that, the population of the district has increased and so has the count of voters,” added Srivastava. Aniket Khare, who bought a flat in Gaur City after shifting from Ballia in 2013, will be voting from the constituency for the first time. "I got a job in the information technology sector and stayed on rent for several years. I bought a flat in Gaur City and have been staying here with my wife for the past three and a half years. Both of us have become voters here," he added. Vivek Mishra, head of department of political science at Gautam Buddha Nagar University, believes that it is better to be a voter in the place of residence as it adds a sense of belonging. “Becoming a voter of the city where one stays is always helpful. It gives more say to a voter in the overall governance of the city. It also adds to the sense of belonging and bonding within the community,” he says. Apart from housing societies, a large number of people from the urban villages have also been added to the list. Though people working in the construction sector have been the most dominant, a lot of jobs in the recent years have been generated in the manufacturing sector. In terms of growth, the overall count of voters has gone up by 26% as compared to that in 2017. Most of the growth has been in Dadri (33%) and jNoida (32%), while Jewar has shown just a 7% growth. The male population among the voters is 56% while that of females is 44%.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/gb-nagar-adds-3-3l-voters-since-2017-assembly-polls/articleshow/88743753.cms||---

Some of the buses will be air conditioned. The service was flagged off from the Kasna Bus Depot by Jewar MLA Dhirendra Singh, Dadri MLA Tejpal Nagar and the UP MLC Srichanda Sharma. The proposed bus routes are meant to cover all the areas of the city. While the maximum residential sectors – 31 in total – will get covered under route number 4, it is route number 2 that will cover the maximum number of villages – 44. The bus on route number 1 will cover the 48.5 km stretch between Nainwa Ka Raipur and Kasna Bus Depot. Other stops on the route include Sirsa, GNIDA office, Tilapta Chowk, Surajpur, LG Chowk and Pari Chowk. Route Number 2 – being the longest – will cover the 71.6 km stretch between Nainwa Ka Raipur and Kisan Chowk, via Sirsa, GNIDA Office, Tilapta Chowk, Kisan Chowk, Surajpur, LG Chowk and Pari Chowk.

The fifth route will be a 38-km ride which will begin at the Noida entry point at DSC road and end at Kasna Bus Depot via LG Chowk, GNIDA Office and DMICIITGNL. The buses will ply on the five routes and recover the cost of service through the sale of tickets. However, GNIDA will bear the operational cost of Rs 30 lakh per month which will be incurred by the UP Roadways after the sale of tickets for the bus service. "We have been receiving requests for local bus connectivity from residents of urban sectors and villages notified in Greater Noida region, for a long time. This decision has been taken to provide easy commute facilities to residents of the city.

The directive follows the complaint against discharge of sewage on open land, roads, internal lanes and the stormwater drains in the villages and the “blockage of stormwater drains with solid waste, plastic waste, construction and demolition waste or other kinds of waste”.Stating that the authorities have failed to enforce citizens’ right to clean environment and the principle of sustainable development, the green court has asked the panel to meet within two weeks, undertake a site visit and ascertain a remedial action plan. Seeking a report within the next two months, the NGT has also directed the committee to draw up an action plan that covers septage management and identify “the authorities responsible for the failure and action to be taken against the violators/erring authorities”.Residents of two Greater Noida villages had approached the NGT with the complaint, stating villagers are being “compelled to clean their sewage/wastewater filled drains themselves and drink polluted water as most of them could not afford purifying RO” or other systems. They also alleged overflowing sewage was damaging roads.Attaching an RTI reply from the Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority (GNIDA), complainants Karamvir Singh, of Milak Lacchi village, and Pradeep Kumar, of Sunpura village, alleged that only 29 out of 122 villages have an operational sewerage system.Observing there were “rampant violation of provisions of Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and Public Trust Doctrine laid down in (the case of) MC Mehta vs Kamal Nath (1997)”, the NGT bench of chairperson Adarsh Kumar Goel and Justice Sudhir Agarwal said, “There is also failure of the authorities to enforce citizens’ right to clean environment and the principle of sustainable development laid down inter-alia in AP Pollution Control Board vs Professor M V Nayadu (1999) and Vellore Citizens Welfare Forum vs Union of India & others (1996). In view of the above, let a joint committee of CPCB, state PCB, GNIDA, DM Gautam Budh Nagar and secretary, urban development, UP look into the matter and take remedial action.” It also appointed the CPCB (Central Pollution Control Board) and the state PCB as the joint nodal agencies for compliance and coordination.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/ngt-form-panel-to-solve-sewage-woes-of-villages/articleshow/88743759.cms||Shikha Salaria

Ironically, Paleker — the 57th South African umpire to officiate in a Test — made his five-day debut with his ‘mentor’ Marias Erasmus at the other end. Like everyone, batting legend Sunil Gavaskar was highly impressed with Paleker’s fine umpiring on Day One of the Test. “So far, he’s got his decisions spot on,” Gavaskar had said. Paleker has already officiated in three ODIs and 29 T20Is. The 44-year-old, who was elevated by the ICC to the Elite Panel of umpires in 2017, had come to India in 2015 to officiate in two Ranji Trophy games. “He had officiated in a Mumbai versus Madhya Pradesh game at the Wankhede Stadium. He had a very good game. I was impressed with his umpiring,” Ganesh Iyer, an ex-BCCI umpire and a former member of the Mumbai Cricket Association’s managing committee told TOI. “We’re so happy that a boy from our village is umpiring in a Test match. We’re really proud of him. His grandfather belonged to our village. His father went to South Africa in search of work, and settled there. He still has a house and relatives here. We’re also his relatives.

The addition of 19,780 fresh cases beat the previous all-time high of 15,014 reported just a day prior. During the Delta-driven second wave, the highest was 11,206 cases on April 4, 2021. While deaths continued to be in single digits (4), Mumbai’s daily positivity rate hit a staggering 30%, reports Sumitra Deb Roy. BMC’s data pegged the new cases even higher at 20,181—an anomaly between daily state and city figures is often due to lag in reporting. The rise in Mumbai’s cases pushed the state’s daily count to an eight-month high of 36,265. The last time Maharashtra had reported more cases was on May 14 (39,923). Active cases in Maharashtra went past the one-lakh mark after six months. Thirteen Covid-19 deaths were reported in the state, registering a negligible rise in fatalities thus far. Also, there were 8,907 recoveries in the state and 2,837 in the city, the highest in a while.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/nearly-1-in-3-tests-positive-citys-count-surges-to-20k-75-more-than-delta-peak/articleshow/88743766.cms||Sumitra Debroy

As scores of doctors, policemen and workers from transportation go into isolation, there are concerns that medical and essential services could take a serious hit in the next few days. Coronavirus in India: Live updatesThe Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) said more than 300 resident doctors alone are down with Covid-19 from the city’s public colleges. In addition, faculty members, nurses, and staffers are infected by the dozens across hospitals. Civic officials admitted that 20%-40% of their workforce is under quarantine. The private sector is hit equally badly, with hospitals like Lilavati in Bandra grappling with more than 130 health staffers infected. At the municipal hospitals, it was decided on Thursday doctors would resume from quarantine within five days instead of seven, if they are asymptomatic. Medical education minister Amit Deshmukh, however, said the situation was under control and the state was empowered to hire medical manpower on contract. Covid positive cases among BEST staffers, especially drivers and conductors, has risen rapidly to 87 in little over a week and this is a cause of concern for the transport body. As many as 21 new cases were reported in a single day on Thursday.

In all, 123 policemen had died of the infection till last year. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, said the rate of infection among medical staffers was a cause for worry. The count of infected healthcare workers at Parel’s KEM Hospital is inching towards 200. Till Wednesday, 81 resident doctors, 24 faculty and 30-35 interns had come positive. There were also infected nurses and ward boys. Dean Dr Sangeeta Ravat said 20% of their staffers are infected. “We have decided to reschedule elective work till we regain our manpower,” she said, adding that wards to isolate doctors as well as patients are filling up in hours.

---||Mumbai||Question before Maharashtra schools & junior colleges: Can Class 10, 12 prelims be held offline?||MUMBAI: A marked rise in Covid-19 infections has put schools and junior colleges in a fix over conducting offline practicals and preliminary exams for classes 10 and 12. With SSC and HSC practicals and exams scheduled between February and April, schools want to finish with on-campus preliminary exams latest by mid-February. Parents, though, have complained of being coerced to get their children vaccinated before they appear for the board exams. Non-state boards such as CBSE and CISCE have directed schools to get Class 10 and 12 students vaccinated first. Both boards are done with their offline first semester board exams. State board schools, too, are gathering information about students’ health and parents’ response to teen vaccination. Bombay Scottish School in Mahim will start vaccinating its Class 10 students from Friday. Principal Sunita George said students will be accompanied by their parents to take the first vaccine dose. As of now, students are visiting Covid jumbo centres for vaccination. Civic schools are transporting eligible students in BEST buses to vaccination centres. Several parents want to adopt a wait-and-watch policy before vaccinating their wards. “My son is attending physical school for practicals. Yet, I don’t want to rush with the vaccine. I will wait for a month and see if there are any side-effects in vaccinated children,” said the mother of a 15-year-old Class 10 student from Bandra. Schools are getting ready to conduct preliminary exams in January’s second week. “The situation is going from bad to worse. We are worried about how to bring students to classrooms for practice tests,” said Veena Donwalkar, principal, Shivaji Vidyalaya, Dharavi. A professor from a Malad junior college said they have scheduled two offline preliminary exams but may have to move them online. “If practice tests are taken online, the purpose of a physical board will be defeated.” A Class 10 teacher from Chembur said students were being readied to write lengthy answers. “The state should now change the exam pattern and make it more objective.” While the exam timetables are out, setting of question papers has not begun, said sources in the education department. “The work of setting papers begins in December. We will watch how the Covid graph moves and take a call on the exam pattern,” said a board official. All classes, barring 10 and 12, will be online till January 31.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/question-before-schools-jr-colleges-can-class-10-12-prelims-be-held-offline/articleshow/88743768.cms||Sandhya Nair

Tope also reiterated that a lockdown was not on the cards. “Shutting Mumbai’s local trains is not under discussion,” he said after a review meeting on Covid cases called by NCP chief Sharad Pawar. “Night curfew and weekend curfew were discussed but finally, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray will decide on the restrictions,” said Tope. He also said there was no plan to have district lockdowns in the state. Officials say various factors are being weighed before deciding on restrictions. Restricting categories of train commuters, and reducing attendance in offices and timings of shops and restaurants are some of the curbs under discussion. “We will have to take steps soon to restrict crowds and gatherings but we will have to take care that these are acceptable to people and do not cripple the economy,” said a senior official. A decision is likely before the weekend. Meanwhile, state minister for food and civil supplies Chhagan Bhujbal said the government would be forced to take harsher measures, including “no vaccination, no ration”, for people who have not taken the jabs. Bhujbal told reporters in Nashik: “Since there are a few who are not taking their shots for no valid reason, we may be compelled to deny them rations, especially in districts where vaccination figures are very low.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/navi-mumbai/tope-locals-will-not-be-stopped-no-lockdown-for-now/articleshow/88746732.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

---||Mumbai||New BMC norms allow home isolation to asymptomatic, those with mild symptoms in Mumbai||MUMBAI: The BMC on Thursday released home isolation guidelines for asymptomatic or mild Covid positive patients in the backdrop of the rapid surge in cases in city. Officials said these guidelines were also to ensure that hospital beds are used only by patients having severe symptoms. However, the civic body clarified that those who cannot isolate themselves at home, will continue to be quarantined at BMC’s isolation facility. The civic body’s guidelines come in the wake of Centre on January 5 making it possible for patients with mild or asymptomatic Covid-19 to home isolate for seven days. “Over the past two years, it has been seen globally as well as in India that majority of Covid-19 cases are either asymptomatic or have very mild symptoms. Such cases usually recover with minimal intenventions, and accordingly may be managed at home under proper medical guidance. The present guidelines are applicable to Covid-19 patients who have been clinically assessed and assigned as mild/asymptomatic cases of Covid-19,” said BMC chief IS Chahal. The revised guidelines mentioned that those with severe symptoms like chest congestion, fever not going down despite three days passing or having oxygen levels below 93 require medical attention and can be admitted in Covid hospitals. However, home isolated patients will require a caregiver to be present round the clock which the BMC said should ideally be a person who is fully vaccinated. This person should be the link between medical officer and the positive patient. Also, those with comorbities will be allowed home isolation but the decision will be taken on the basis of medical evaluation. Home isolation shall not be applicable for pregnant women expecting to deliver in two weeks, said the civic body. A senior BMC official said there are plans to have 300 doctors across all war ward rooms who will provide medical assistance to mild symptomatic or asymptomatic patients. “This will help us better bed management at hospitals,” said a official. Meanwhile, the BMC has also allowed home isolation for close contacts of positive patients who will be tested on the seventh day only in case of symptoms. Following central government orders, the BMC said patients under home isolation will stand discharged and end isolation after at least seven days have passed from testing positive and no fever for three successive days, and shall continue wearing masks. There is no need for re-testing after home isolation period is over.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/new-bmc-norms-allow-home-isolation-to-asymptomatic-those-with-mild-symptoms/articleshow/88743770.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Mumbai||‘Bulli Bai creator’ slammed Mumbai cops in tweets for ‘arresting wrong people’||MUMBAI/ DELHI: The Delhi Police’s Intelligence Fusion and Strategic Operations (IFSO) unit on Thursday arrested the alleged creator of the ‘Bulli Bai’ app and Twitter handle, Neeraj Bishnoi (21), from Jorhat in Assam. This is the fourth arrest in the case. Earlier, Mumbai cybercrime police had arrested Vishal Kumar Jha (21), a Bihar youth studying engineering in Bengaluru; Shweta Singh (18), a class XII passout from Uttarakhand; and Mayank Rawat (21) from Uttarakhand studying BSc (Chemistry) at a college in Delhi University. The ‘Bulli Bai’ case was registered on January 1 followi-ng complaints that doctored photographs and details of 100 prominent Muslim women were uploaded for ‘auction’ on the app hosted on the open-source software platform GitHub. “Bishnoi confessed that he had also created a Twitter account (@Sage0x1) for tweeting about the app. He was monitoring the news on social media and created another Twitter account (@giyu44) to tweet to Mumbai police that they have arrested the wrong persons,” Malhotra said. Bishnoi has allegedly confessed that Singh tried to save him by claiming that she had created the Twitter handle. “He also said he had renamed Jha’s Twitter handle to Khalsa Supremacists to post the contents,” police said. Hours before his arrest, on Wednesday evening, Bishnoi slammed Mumbai police with a series of tweets on @giyu44 even as the city top cop Hemant Nagrale was briefing mediapersons about the three arrests. In the tweets, Bishnoi allegedly took sole responsibility for creating the app and said the three people arrested by Mumbai cybercrime police were innocent. “I will personally surrender if someone arranges for my travel by flight. Slumbai police must publicly apologize for arresting two innocents and defaming them. You have arrested the wrong person, slumbai police. I am the creator of #BulliBaiApp. Not some rando 21 y/o engineer or some 18 y/o mentally insane kid (Who was a minor 4 months back). Got nothing to do with the innocents whom u arrested, release them asap. The first step is to provide them compensation and arrest this @AmirLadka pajeet for giving them wrong information,” he tweeted. He further tweeted that he wanted to take revenge against one Soni Brothers who challenged Jha in “e-wars” on social media and “spoilt his career”. His last tweet mentioned: “When this fiasco started, I wasn’t even aware of what it might entail, so I used my friends’ accounts. Both Vishal and that Swati girl, I used their accounts...they didn’t even know what I was gonna do. Now they got arrested coz of me... feel free to abuse me in comments. I knew about the girl’s father. I knew she was using Twitter for solace,” he tweeted. Singh had lost her father to Covid last year. Though Delhi police had sought details from GitHub using the official MLAT (Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty) channel, they didn’t rely on them and proceeded with their own technical investigation. Delhi police commissioner Rakesh Asthana transferred the probe to the IFSO unit and formed a special team, led by Malhotra and which also comprised cyber experts. “With the help of CERT-IN, the raw data analysis along with the technical details was undertaken and the suspect was identified to be based in Jorhat,” Malhotra said. The team conducted a raid in Digambar Chuk area on Wednesday and after a 12-hour door-to-door operation located the suspect’s house around 11pm. They seized his laptop and mobile phones. Bishnoi had created the app using his laptop—forensics have traced the remnants on the device—and given it to some online propagators for wide circulation. Police also recovered the footprints, like list codes of people whose details were uploaded on the app. Bishnoi was taken to Delhi cyber police station (South East) at 3.30pm where the first case was registered based on a woman journalist’s complaint. Meanwhile, Jha, Singh, and Rawat will be produced before the Bandra court on January 10. —Inputs by Ramendra Singh from Bhopal||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/bulli-bai-creator-slammed-city-cops-in-tweets-for-arresting-wrong-people/articleshow/88743771.cms||Narayan Namboodiri

The unidentified accused had called them up and asked them to update their KYC details for their SIM cards. The caller said that if it were not done, the card would be blocked. It is not clear if the same person had called up these three complainants. The Malabar Hill police registered a case where the 82-year-old businessman told the police that his two bank accounts were debited. The victim got a message with a contact number on his phone. He called up on the number when the receiver said he was calling from the customer care service of a cellular network operator, said an officer. The caller asked the victim to update his Aadhar card details and fill the KYC form in 24 hours. “The caller collected the victim’s debit card details and said that a ‘secret number’ will be sent to the victim’s mobile phone, which he will have to share. It was the OTP. The accused transferred Rs 1.75 lakh from the victim’s account to another account. Later money was withdrawn from an ATM in Jharkhand,” said an officer. In another case registered at D B Marg police station, a 73-year-old chartered accountant lodged a complaint about a similar modus operandi used by a caller to siphon off Rs 1 lakh from his account. In this case too, the CA had shared an OTP with the caller. In the third case, a 73-year-old Kemps Corner resident received a call where the caller asked her to update KYC details or her SIM would be blocked. The caller first shared the victim’s Aadhar card’s four digits and gained her trust posing as he was a genuine caller. The woman shared her bank details and OTP. Soon, Rs 1.5 lakh was deducted from her account. Investigators are now collecting details about the accounts where money was transferred by the accused. A senior police officer said, “One should not share details about bank account, debit or credit cards with anyone. One has to be alert. We have registered three cases.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/3-sr-citizens-share-info-for-sim-card-kyc-lose-4-3-lakh/articleshow/88743776.cms||Mateen Hafeez

The proposal was placed before the civic group leaders on Tuesday, but was not taken up for discussion. After the three wards are split, Mumbai will have 27 administrative wards, three more than the existing 24. The BMC is keen to redraw the boundaries of these three wards as providing civic amenities, like water supply, sanitation and citizen services, has become a challenge owing to the huge geographical area and population size, said a senior civic official. The BMC-appointed two-member panel, comprising joint municipal commissioners Bharat Marathe and Sunil Dhamne, had recently proposed to bifurcate K-East ward into K-South and K-North, and L ward into L-South and L-North. K-East ward has a population of more than 8.2 lakh people living across 16.8 sq km area. “The panel has identified two new locations for K-South and K-North wards and after bifurcation, of the existing 15 corporators, seven will be in K-South and the remaining eight in K-North ward,” said the official. The existing K-East administrative building will be used for both wards. L ward is spread over 15.6 sq km and houses a population of nearly 9 lakh. “According to the proposal, this ward will be split into L-South and L-North. Of the existing 16 corporators, nine will be in L-North and seven in L-South. The existing ward office in Kurla (W) will be converted into L-South ward office and a new L-North ward office will be set up in a BMC building in Chandivli,” the official said. In January 2021, in their reply to BJP MLA Atul Bhatkhalkar, officials of the urban development department had said that the decision to bifurcate P-North ward has been taken, but BMC is still working out the details. “The BMC made a budget allocation of Rs 5 crore for splitting P-North ward, but nothing has been done on the ground for a year. The BMC must carry out rational and optimal reorganization of wards. There are wards like B and C in south Mumbai that hardly have any population. They should be merged so that resources are not wasted,” suggested Samajwadi Party MLA and corporator Rais Shaikh.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/bmc-proposes-to-split-2-more-populous-wards/articleshow/88743777.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Shelar has demanded a special investigation team (SIT) be appointed to look into the serious issue of “water loot” across the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. A copy of the letter highlighting illegal and excessive groundwater extraction, water thefts has also been sent to C D Joshi, Groundwater Survey and Development Agency commissioner. “According to a survey conducted by the Central Groundwater Department, the city has more than 19,000 water wells, of which nearly 12,500 are bore wells. The BMC has issued notices to nearly 251 wells, of which 216 are illegal. Also according to media reports, water worth nearly Rs 80 crore is getting stolen from a single water well. Since there is no regulation or strict enforcement of the law, it is believed that illegal water tanker mafia are looting water to the tune of Rs 3,000 crore in Mumbai alone,” said.

In all, 139 had tested positive; 63 were crew members, nine passengers were from Mumbai and 67 were from outside the city. BMC officials said most of them were asymptomatic and hence allowed to quarantine at home. The cases spread quickly from one crew member to 66 by the time it reached Goa, and then to 139 when it returned to Mumbai, leading civic officials to suspect lapses in isolating the positive patients on board. TOI reached out for a statement to Waterways Leisure Tourism Pvt Ltd, but there was no response. After the ship anchored at Green Gate port in Ballard Pier on Tuesday evening, civic officials said they began testing all on board. The exercise continued till 5.30am on Wednesday. Of the 1,827 persons tested, 139 turned out to be positive. Assistant municipal commissioner Shivdas Gurav, in charge of the A Ward, said their staff was on duty and two laboratories had been pressed into service to ensure testing for all as quickly as possible. “The 60 positive patients already on board were disembarked quickly and sent to either BMC quarantine or paid quarantine facilities. The test for the rest were immediately conducted and once the reports showed 139 were positive, the protocol to either send them for home isolation or institutional quarantine has been followed,” said Gurav, adding that the passengers allowed to go home will have to mandatorily undergo home isolation for seven days and the BMC officials have stamped their hands. The ship had left for Goa from Mumbai last weekend and during the journey, one crew member showed flu-like symptoms. The crew member was tested and it came positive. When the cruise management informed the local authorities at Goa, all on board were tested, and 66 were found to be positive. The number grew to 139 in a few days.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/cruise-ship-with-covid-cluster-finally-empties-2-days-after-return-from-goa/articleshow/88743781.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Mumbai||Mumbai’s home isolation numbers see 300% spike in a week to 3.3 lakh from 83,000||MUMBAI: Following a sharp rise in Covid cases in the city, the number of individuals under home quarantine has shot up 300% in a span of a week— from less than 1 lakh on December 29, 2021, to 3,32,849 as on January 5. On December 29, their number stood at 83,250. Officials said the rise in home quarantine numbers could also be due to the fact that the majority of the cases are asymptomatic. Apart from asymptomatic cases, these figures include close contacts of positive patients and international travellers who are under home quarantine as a precautionary measure. Officials said in case anyone spots a positive patient flouting the home quarantine rule, they can complain about it to the concerned civic war room. Juhu corporator Renu Hansraj said several Mumbaikars are testing positive but the majority of the cases are asymptomatic. “This category hence prefers to quarantine at home. In most highrises, neighbours help out by fetching essentials for them so that they do not step out,” said Hansraj. Cuffe Parade corporator Harshita Narwekar said home quarantine numbers may rise even further considering the rate at which positive cases are increasing. “This time, based on the feedback we have received, the number of cases is high and the severity is lower. Also, there are many cases of entire families testing positive. A lot of people are going in for rapid home testing after purchasing testing kits from local chemists. However, in case it shows a positive result, I suggest they undertake an RT-PCR test,” said Narwekar. The Centre on Wednesday cut the quarantine period after testing positive from at least 10 days to seven. King’s Circle activist Nikhil Desai said there are people who flout the rule as they feel they have taken the two vaccine shots. “Also, there are several reports which indicate Omicron is milder. However, we cannot live with such hopes and need to strictly follow the quarantine rule.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/citys-home-isolation-numbers-see-300-spike-in-a-wk-to-3-3l-from-83k/articleshow/88743782.cms||Richa Pinto

About 57 of the 79 cases were reported from Mumbai, whose overall count of the variant has reached 565. Nationally, more than 2,300 cases of the variant have been detected already. State officials said all cases were confirmed by the National Institute of Virology, Pune. Of the total cases, 381 have already been discharged. About the Mumbai cases, BMC said 31 of the 57 were international travellers. The cohort includes 19 city residents and 12 outsiders detected with Covid on arrival and later found positive for Omicron. 24 individuals detected with Omicron didn’t have any international travel history.

---||Mumbai||As Mumbai's Covid case count surges to 20,000, BMC says it could double soon||MUMBAI: A total of 1,170 people were hospitalised on Thursday in Mumbai, which was a marginal drop from Wednesday’s 1,218 hospitalisations. However, more than 100 (106) were put on oxygen support. While the overall bed occupancy of the city rose to nearly 17%, almost a quarter of the 2,636 ICU beds are now taken. The city’s biggest slum cluster, Dharavi, reported 107 cases, the highest ever one-day count since the start of the pandemic. Civic officials said that considering the daily growth rate—cases increased by 31.7% in 24 hours -- Mumbai could see more than double of 20,000 cases in a day in the next few days. “Our daily highest projection was 20,000 that we reached rapidly. There is a possibility we may see double that number, given that cases are increasing by 30-40%,” said Suresh Kakani, BMC additional municipal commissioner. The city’s active cases reached 79,260, and it is likely Mumbai will breach its previous high of active cases of 91,100 — seen during the second wave peak — in the next 24 hours. Kakani said that although cases are galloping, the corporation has not hit the panic button as the infected are mostly asymptomatic. On Thursday, 85% of the new cases didn’t have any symptoms. “Of the new cases, merely 5% require admission,” he said, adding that almost 35,000 beds are available. About the crunch of ICU beds in the private sector, he said, “Beds are available, but people may not get rooms of their liking such as single or deluxe. Our request would be to focus on the treatment rather than the stay”. Even as the state chalks out curbs to curtail transmission, health minister Rajesh Tope clarified that there was no plan to shut down Mumbai’s local trains. Also, there were no plans for a statewide or district lockdown. However, he said night curfew and weekend curfew was discussed at a review meeting with NCP chief Sharad Pawar, but a final decision would be taken by CM Uddhav Thackeray. Restricting categories of train commuters and reducing attendance in offices and timings of shops and restaurants are some of the curbs under discussion. A decision is expected before the weekend. State officials also maintained that despite a rise in cases, there hasn’t been a significant jump in oxygen usage. Comparing the severity of waves, Dr Pradeep Awate, the state’s surveillance officer, said around 11% of patients were on oxygen and ventilator when the state had 85,144 active cases during the second wave. In comparison, 4% were on oxygen and life-support when active cases crossed 87,505 on Wednesday. Nearly 84% of the state’s cases were detected from the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. Kalyan-Dombivli on Thursday reported over 1,000 (1,172) Covid-19 cases in a day, taking its cumulative tally of cases to 1,47,521. The silver lining was that there were no deaths reported. Thane and Navi Mumbai reported 2,180 and 2,297 cases respectively.

The previous highest was on April 8, 2021, when the area had reported 99 Covid cases. Officials said they have been aggressively testing to curb the spread of the virus and therefore, the numbers are soaring. Covid-19 had entered Dharavi on April 1, 2020, and there were days when over 90 cases were reported from there. For instance, on May 3 last year, 95 cases were reported, while on May 15, 84 cases were reported. On December 25, 2020, for the first time the area reported zero Covid cases since the start of the pandemic. For a long period, Covid cases stayed below 20 there. The first vaccination centre within any slum cluster was set up in Dharavi, where the BMC aimed to vaccinate the senior population and those with comorbidities by setting up the centre at an urban health centre, popularly known as ‘Chota Sion Hospital’.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/dharavi-sees-record-107-cases-in-a-day/articleshow/88743785.cms||---

On Thursday, both the IMD and Colaba observatory recorded maximum temperatures below 30 degrees Celsius. Over the past few days, Mumbai witnessed a rise in temperatures with IMD Santacruz on January 4 recording a maximum temperature of 33.3 degrees. However, on Thursday the IMD Colaba observatory recorded a maximum temperature of 28.6 degrees Celsius while the IMD Santacruz observatory recorded maximum temperatures of 29.5 degree celcius. In case of Colaba, the maximum temperatures recorded was 1.9 degrees below normal while in case of Santacruz it was 1.7 degrees below normal. “An induced cyclonic circulation lies over southeast Rajasthan and its neighborhood which will attract high moisture from the sea. Owing to this a dip in temperatures can be expected,” IMD said. Owing to this, light rain or thunder activity can also be expected in interiors parts of Thane and Palghar districts, says the IMD forecast.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/imd-predicts-drop-in-city-temperatures-over-weekend/articleshow/88743786.cms||---

This led to a global selloff in stocks. As a result, the sensex fell over 900 points in early trades on Thursday and closed 621 points, or 1%, lower at 59,602 with Reliance Industries, HDFC Bank and Infosys contributing the most to the loss.The sensex closed lower after four consecutive sessions of gains, during which it added nearly 2,500 points. The rising number of new Covid infections daily across the country, which could potentially derail the slow and fragile economic revival process, is also making market players nervous.On Thursday, Nikkei in Japan closed nearly 3% off while the FTSE in the UK was down nearly 1% in late sessions. In early trades in the US, most leading indices were down between 0.4% and 1%. End of the session data on the BSE showed that in Thursday’s market, foreign funds were net sellers at Rs 1,927 crore — the first such net outflow figure in 2022.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/sensex-falls-621-points-on-hawkish-us-fed-omicron/articleshow/88743787.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Banks can tag more of small biz deposits as stable||Mumbai: In a move that will make it easier for smaller banks to comply with RBI’s prudential norms, the central bank has allowed lenders to recognise deposits of up to Rs 7.5 crore by small businesses for purpose of maintaining liquidity coverage ratio (LCR). The earlier threshold for deposit being part of LCR was Rs 5 crore.“While the circular intends to align the definition of small business customer across different circulars, it will also have a collateral impact of improving LCR for banks,” said an analyst. The LCR requirement was introduced as part of post-Global Financial Crisis (GFC) reforms by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) — the international association of banking regulators. The idea behind this is that a bank should at all times have liquid assets to meet 30 days’ net outgo under stressed conditions.The LCR is measured by dividing the value of high-quality liquid assets (including government bonds) that a bank holds by the expected outgo in 30 days. While measuring outflows, small business deposits are considered as sticky deposits with lower run-off. When the ticket size of small deposits is increased from Rs 5 crore to Rs 7.5 crore, it means that the quantum of hot money that can go out will decrease and thus improve the bank’s LCR.The revision in LCR norms comes at a time when the RBI is normalising some of the liquidity that it has created for banks to tide over the pandemic. Corporate deposits are considered as hot money and not stable deposits as they are parked for business use. Smaller deposits are considered stable as they also form part of savings. “With the objective to better align our guidelines with the BCBS standard and enable banks to manage liquidity risk more effectively, it has been decided to increase the threshold limit for deposits and other extensions of funds made by non-financial small business customers,” the RBI said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/banks-can-tag-more-of-small-biz-deposits-as-stable/articleshow/88743788.cms||---
---||Mumbai||RIL’s $4bn foreign currencybonds issue is India’s biggest||Mumbai: Reliance Industries (RIL) has raised $4 billion in the biggest foreign currency bond sale by an Indian corporate. It had recently received board approval to raise up to $5 billion in foreign bonds to take advantage of the low interest rate environment and to refinance existing borrowings. The bond issue was subscribed nearly three times with peak order book aggregating $11.5 billion. The bonds were bought by investors from Asia (53%), America (33%) and Europe (14%). It was the largest foreign currency bond issuance from India, RIL claimed, dwarfing the earlier record set by energy major ONGC Videsh when it raised $2.2 billion in dollars notes in 2014. Bharti Airtel had raised $1.25 billion in 2021, which was the biggest debt issue last year. The jumbo foreign currency bond issue was the largest debt capital market transaction at $4 billion and the “tightest credit spreads across each of the long-dated tenors for any corporate in India”, said RIL joint chief financial officer Srikanth Venkatachari. RIL did not divulge the name of the subscribers of the bonds. But, industry sources said the subscribers included Fidelity, Pacific Investment Management Co (Pimco), Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM), Metlife, Eastspring, NeubergerBerman, Blackrock and Lombard Odier. The bonds will be listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange. “Despite heavy competing calendar at the beginning of the year, RIL printed the lowest ever 30-year coupon and the lowest ever reoffer spread on a 10-year bond from an Indian issuer,” said Bank of America India head Kaku Nakhate.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/rils-4bn-foreign-currencybonds-issue-is-indias-biggest/articleshow/88743789.cms||---

Close to 1 lakh of brightest school students take the exam conducted by Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education. The four exams — two each on January 9 and 16 — have been postponed and a decision regarding two others on January 23 will be made in a few days, after taking stock of the Covid situation.The two Olympiad exams on January 9, Indian Olympiad Qualifier in mathematics (taken by class X, XI and XII students) and Indian Olympiad Qualifier in Junior Science (taken by ninth and tenth graders) have been postponed. Similarly, the Indian Olympiad Qualifier in physics and Indian Olympiad Qualifier in biology exams scheduled to be held on January 16, have also been put off right now.The decision was taken “in view of the worsening situation of the Covid-19 pandemic across the country, and consequent closure of educational institutions and travel restrictions announced by the central government and different state governments”.Olympiad team member professor Aniket Sule told TOI, “In about 10 states, schools have been closed and they cannot open them to even conduct any exams. In some other states, there are weekend curfews that have been imposed. We have also received letters from students whose buildings are sealed. Taking all that into account, four exams have currently been postponed and new dates would be announced once there is clarity on the Covid front.”The final decision on the conduct of the Indian Olympiad Qualifier in astronomy and Indian Olympiad Qualifier in chemistry scheduled to be held on January 23 will be announced after January 10. The national Olympiad programme in science subjects culminating in the international Olympiads of 2022 has been disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic.In a departure from the usual three-stage procedure for selecting teams to represent India at the international Olympiads that has been followed in the past, the selection procedure for the 2021-2022 cycle has been condensed to a two-stage process, similar to last year, which includes the Indian Olympiad qualifier and an orientation-cum-selection camp. The objective type test conducted in November and the subjective exam in January have been combined into one exam like last year.Again, last year, all the international Olympiads were conducted online and the Olympiad body would take its decision on this year’s format by March.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/all-india-olympiad-exams-put-off-due-to-rise-in-omicron-cases/articleshow/88743790.cms||Hemali Chhapia

This is being done in view of the rise in Covid-19 cases in the city. Buses run almost packed during morning and evening peak hours. While the checks continued till late evening and figures of those caught without valid vaccine certificates were unavailable, BEST spokesperson Manoj Varade said that commuters were taken by surprise when bus inspectors and conductors demanded the Universal pass. “Many of them promptly showed the double dose certificates on mobile phones or on paper. Our checks continued in most buses and at bus stops in Colaba, Wadala and Mumbai Central, among other places,” Varade said. BEST committee chairman Ashish Chemburkar had announced earlier that there will be random checking for double vaccination certificates BEST has also decided to deploy at least 200 ticket checkers at key bus stops and stations, especially during rush hour, to ensure that people with e-tickets are validating tickets during journeys and to keep a hawk eye on ticketless passengers. BEST general manager Lokesh Chandra said, “We are witnessing a huge rush of commuters, with our daily ridership touching over 28 lakh now. We will soon cross 30 lakh and touch the pre-Covid ridership of 32 lakh. However, we need to keep a check on our revenue and ensure that only those with valid tickets and smartcard passes are travelling in our buses.” For e-tickets, which can be bought using the Chalo mobile app, the ticket is valid for 24 hours. “But if the ticket is not activated with the conductor’s machine, it continues to remain valid for the entire day. So, the commuter can alight from the bus and use the same ticket to board another bus — which is illegal and attracts a penalty of Rs 500. In such cases, the ticket checker can check his e-ticket when he alights at a bus stop.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/amid-covid-spread-best-starts-drive-to-check-universal-pass/articleshow/88743791.cms||Somit Sen

It’s purely a skills-based camp. It is being overseen by chief selector Chetan Sharma. his co-selector Sunil Joshi and VVS Laxman, who is the NCA chief, is also present at the camp” a source told TOI on Thursday. Laxman is soon slated to depart to the West Indies to watch the Under-19 World Cup. The three-match ODI series will begin at Paarl on January 19. The second match will also be played at Paarl on January 21 while the third one will be at Cape Town on January 23.Those who will fly away for the ODI series in South Africa after the camp are Shikhar Dhawan, Suryakumar Yadav, Ruturaj Gaikwad, Venkatesh Iyer, Ishan Kishan (wicketkeeper), Yuzvendra Chahal, Washington Sundar, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Deepak Chahar and Prasidh Krishna.No camp for women’s team before World CupMeanwhile, there will be no pre-World Cup camp for the Indian women’s team before the side departs for New Zealand. “The squad is likely to assemble in Mumbai by the 15th or 16th. They will undergo a week or 10-day quarantine in Mumbai, before leaving for New Zealand, where they will again have to undergo a hard 14-day quarantine in their hotel rooms,” revealed a source.Within the BCCI, there are diverse views on whether a camp should have been held for the Indian women’s team at this time. “We could have held a camp in a bio-secure atmosphere,” said a BCCI official. “The players have played enough cricket in recent times. They played in the Women's Big Bash League in Australia and then in the National One-day championship. In the present case, holding a camp would have been risky for the players,” said another official. The 15-member squad will play the one-off T20 International against New Zealand at Napier on February 9, before playing a five-match ODI series against the hosts from February 11 to 24.The Women’s World Cup will be held from March 4 to April 3.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/odi-picks-undergoing-camp-at-bengaluru/articleshow/88743796.cms||---

Let them arrest me or opposition leader Siddaramaiah or our MLAs and party workers. We will not stop,” said KPCC president DK Shivakumar.He made this statement after home minister Araga Jnanendra warned of action in case of violation of rules. “If they (Congress) go ahead with the padayatra and violate guidelines, necessary action will be taken,” he said.An unfazed Shivakumar said Jnanendra should be reborn to act against them. “I know the home minister well. Who is he to threaten us? We are walking for water and there will be no violation of Covid-19 norms,” he added.Shivakumar also criticised the alleged double standards of the state government for allowing the oath-taking ceremony of 25 newly elected MLCs at the banquet hall in Vidhana Soudha, where scores of their supporters attended the event.“While I am not against the event, it could have been held inside the legislative council or in a closed environment with minimum people. How did the home minister give permission for this? Is he trying to scare us? Congress will not be bogged down by such empty threats,” said Shivakumar.Reacting to Shivakumar’s challenge, Bommai said: “It does not matter what Shivakumar says. The law will take its own course.

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Only DKS & Siddaramaiah will walk on first day of padayatra||BENGALURU: KPCC president DK Shivakumar and Congress legislature party chief Siddaramaiah said only both of them will kick off the 168-km padayatra demanding implementation of Mekedatu reservoir project to avoid Covid protocol violation and avert arrest. Shivakumar said they will walk the first stretch of 15km on Sunday and party functionaries will join on Monday when there will be no curfew. The padayatra is planned for 19 days covering over 50 assembly constituencies. Siddaramaiah said there is no bar on only two people walking on the road and hoped the government won’t stop them. The move also helped the party high command bring together rival camps of Shivakumar and Siddaramaiah who are in the race for the chief ministerial post if Congress returns to power. “The high command has conveyed to both that the party will take a call on the CM after the assembly polls and till then they should work together to bring back the party to power,” said a Congress functionary. Siddaramaiah has been actively involved in preparations for the padayatra. “Some people tried to create an impression that Shivakumar and I are at loggerheads. But, we are united,” he said. The government is ensuring no activities take place near Mekedatu on Sunday. It has ordered all lodges and hotels to shut down. The Ramanagara district administration has made it clear that it will not allow even a single person to venture in public places. “Only those involved in essential services are allowed to commute,” said Jawaregowda T, additional deputy commissioner, Ramanagara. Law and parliamentary affairs minister JC Madhu Swamy said: “Let Congress take up padayatra, there will be no problem for them.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/only-dks-siddaramaiah-will-walk-on-first-day-of-padayatra/articleshow/88743807.cms||B V Shiva Shankar

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka govt moots Rs 244 crore integrated flyover at Hebbal, seeks public opinion||BENGALURU: The urban development department (UDD) has decided to construct a Rs 244-crore integrated flyover as well as extra lanes at Hebbal. This is to ensure better integration of road and rail modes at Hebbal, one of the most congested junctions in the city where traffic from different directions like Kempegowda International Airport (KIA), Tumakuru side, city and KR Puram converges. “The state government and BMRCL engaged RITES Ltd for a comprehensive study and a master plan for capacity augmentation at Hebbal junction to meet the estimated road traffic requirement of 2051 and integration of other modes of transport like Metro and suburban lines,” BMRCL said on Thursday. BMRCL MD Anjum Parwez said these are part of development works in Bengaluru for which the cabinet approved Rs 6,000 crore. BMRCL, on behalf of UDD, has sought public consultation and citizens can share views via email to PRO, BMRCL (chavan@bmrc.co.in) within 15 days.  UDD has proposed an additional two-lane flyover to the west of the existing one making it five-lane movement from city to airport. While existing elevated loop from city to Tumakuru will have to be rebuilt after the new lanes are added, existing elevated loop from city to KR Puram will be retained. Similarly, existing elevated connection from KR Puram to the city will have to be rebuilt. From Tumakuru to city, the loop will be removed to make this space available for multimodal integration and BMTC bus stop. Vehicles will run further and take a U-turn through underpasses and travel to the city over the loop of KR Puram to city as per the proposed plan. “BDA has already planned for construction of a three-lane underpass (for Tumakuru to KR Puram traffic) which will continue. KR Puram to airport, two-lane elevated flyover as planned by BDA will be provided. From KR Puram to Tumakuru, the existing straight road is widened to a four-lane road,” the proposed plan reads. The land required for this is estimated at 33,558 sqm (23,118 sqm of government land and 10,440 sqm of private land). “Piers of the new flyover coming up on the western side will be located over the bund of Hebbal lake. After construction of piers, the lake bund will be brought back to the original condition and piers will not cause any additional constriction to the water body,” it said. Hebbal records over 3.9 lakh PCUs during daily traffic, including 26,896 PCUs during peak hours. By 2051, it will be increased to over 6.9 lakh PCUs with daily traffic at 40,935 PCUs during peak hours.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/govt-moots-244cr-integrated-flyover-at-hebbal-seeks-public-opinion/articleshow/88743810.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||School lodges plaint against kin on girl’s charge about religion||BENGALURU: A private school in BTM Layout has filed a police complaint against the parents of a class 2 student who alleged forceful promotion of a religion by her maths teacher in class. In the complaint, Orchids The International School, BTM Layout, has said the parents intentionally uploaded a video on social media falsely accusing the teacher of forcefully promoting the practice of a religion in the maths class. The school has requested Mico Layout police to summon and counsel the parents. Police have registered a non-cognisable report over the incident. A video of the girl alleging that her maths teacher had asked her to pray to Allah during the class had surfaced on social media on Wednesday. The school had denied the allegations. In the video, the girl is heard saying how the maths teacher asked them to pray to Allah during the money chapter: “Everyone was getting confused and getting all wrong answers in tests. So next day, Ma’am made us pray Allah...Hands were made into bowl shape... Me and few of my classmates were Hindus. We kept telling Ma’am that we were Hindus and we did not want to pray to Allah. But Ma’am said we should pray to Allah and Allah is a better God...” The school, however, called the allegations baseless. “Considering the serious nature of this matter, the management swiftly conducted an intense investigation. The management spoke in detail with the parent of the ward and the said teacher to understand the issue, checked the CCTV footage of the class, spoke to the parents as well as children who attended the said class and asked them if any such forceful promotion of religious act was made,” it said. “After a thorough investigation, we have found that no such instance occurred in the maths class as the teacher focused only on her subject and never said anything about any religion. The children in the classroom have confirmed that the teacher has been accused wrongly and not said anything outside the purview of her subject. Hence we have concluded that the allegation made in the video is inaccurate and untrue,” read a statement from the school.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/school-lodges-plaint-against-kin-on-girls-charge-about-religion/articleshow/88743812.cms||---

Her two children, aged 4 and 2, also came in contact with the blaze and succumbed to the burns. The tragic incident took place at SM Gollahalli village near Doddaballapura town, 40km from Bengaluru.

---||Bengaluru||Need to step out on weekends, unwind after WFH: Professionals||BENGALURU: Many working professionals believe they work hard five or six days a week and need the weekends for relaxing and rejuvenating themselves. Multiple working professionals TOI spoke with said the recent guidelines issued by the state government have raised several questions. Night curfew from 10pm to 5am, 50% occupancy at cinema halls, auditoriums and other similar places, and weekend curfew are among them. Abhiram H, a working professional, said, “We work very hard during weekdays and need a break on weekends. Especially as we are working from home, we need to step out at least on weekends.” The professionals say they are completely on board with night curfew and the 50% cap on theatre occupancy, but are concerned only about the weekend curfew. Suhas Niranjan said, “The city was unprepared for the first wave of the pandemic. But during the second wave, a significant number of people experienced struggle after contracting Covid. Citizens are likely to be more cautious this time by not letting their guard down at any cost.” Many said they are only asking for places to be open even during the weekends with the very same restrictions, and the number of people who step out on weekdays might increase making the weekend curfew redundant. Nidhi Shetty K, another young IT professional from the city, said, “With WFH getting extended for most IT firms, it becomes very difficult for us if we can’t get out for a bit. Man is a social animal. Staying at home during weekends and jumping right back to work might just start affecting work.” She further said, “However, we understand the seriousness of the virus and the consequences of not taking adequate precautions.” Akshay AG, an IT professional, said, “After having witnessed the horrors of the second wave, we can understand why the government took this decision. But we are hoping it finds a way to enforce Covid-appropriate behaviour in a stricter way and gives us relief.” Traders rattled as well Sajjan Raj Mehta, trade activist said, “Since March 2020, traders have been merely surviving. We have not made profit or found scope to improve our businesses. Since the outbreak of the pandemic, we have shown full cooperation to the government not just as traders but citizens. At least out of respect for that, they must hear us out this time. They need to issue revised guidelines and maybe allow the city to open only for a couple of hours on weekends.” PC Rao, president, Bangalore Hoteliers Association, said, “Ours is a business that thrives during weekends and hence the curfew is going to be a big blow. It is highly unlikely that the spread happens only during weekends. Experts have made it abundantly clear that the third wave is going to be mild and yet the government is taking decisions that directly affect our day-to-day business.” Manoj Padikkal, general secretary, Karnataka Salon and Wellness Owners Associations, said, “Since March 2020, 40% of the salons in the city have closed. Salons see their clients mostly during weekends. Although the new guidelines do not specifically mention that salons and spas are not supposed to be open on weekends, if public movement is itself restricted, we have to assume that we also have to lose out on business. We are on board with allowing only double-jabbed clients.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/need-to-step-out-on-weekends-unwind-after-wfh-professionals/articleshow/88743819.cms||Mrinalini Bhat
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru transporters say curbs will hit income, can’t afford another lockdown||BENGALURU:Transport operators, including cab and autorickshaw drivers, are worried that weekend and night curfew will further reduce their earnings. Cash-strapped government transit agencies like BMTC, KSRTC and Namma Metro are also keeping their fingers crossed in the wake of soaring Covid cases. “We are facing a severe financial crisis but the government has imposed curfew at night and on weekends, which will further affect the transport and tourism sectors. For the past two years, the transport segment has completely collapsed due to Covid and work-from-home arrangement,” said K Radhakrishna Holla, president, Karnataka State Travel Operators Association. Holla said they are struggling to pay vehicle and business loans, GST, Motor Vehicle (MV) tax and insurance. “We want the government to check Covid without impacting daily business activities,” he said. Tanveer Pasha, president of Ola Uber Drivers and Owners Association, said: “The state government is playing with the lives of people. We have just started recovering from the losses of previous lockdowns but it is again in a hurry to impose another one. Most drivers are getting business only during weekends.” He said most foreign cities have focused on awareness and enforcement of mask rule instead of a complete lockdown. “The government should allow establishments to open 24X7 to reduce crowds in shops and on roads. Most cab drivers are in a state of panic as they cannot afford another lockdown,” he said. Manoj Padikkal, chairman (school transport wing, south zone), Bus and Car Operators’ Confederation of India, said: “Many school transport operators paid pending MV tax and insurance premium after some schools reopened two-three months ago. But now all schools have been closed and parents are refusing to pay transport fees. There is no MV tax exemption. Many transporters may have to leave business if the government continues to impose restrictions.” C Sampath, general secretary, Adarsh Auto Drivers’ Union, said: “The government has not provided ration kits or sanitisers to auto drivers. Only a few drivers received the compensation announced during the first and second waves. Already, a few people are on the streets due to the Covid scare so business has reduced. The curfew will further affect the earnings of drivers. How will they pay EMIs?” STUs, Namma Metro too bear the bruntBMTC will operate 10% essential services in the city, excluding containment zones, between 6am and 10pm during weekends. However, Vayu Vajra AC airport services will run as usual. “Our daily ridership is around 25 lakh and revenue is around Rs 3.1 crore. We are expecting revenue of only Rs 5 lakh a day during weekends,” said a BMTC official. “Our daily ridership is between 3.3-3.5 lakh compared to 5 lakh before Covid. Curfew at night and on weekends will definitely have an impact on our ridership but we need to follow the government norms to curb the pandemic,” said a BMRCL official. KSRTC officials said their daily ridership is around 23 lakh compared to 30 lakh in pre-Covid times. “We are now operating 7,500 buses compared to 8,250 earlier. The government has allowed buses to operate during night and weekends. But weekend curfew will have an impact because of lack of business activities. We are expecting a loss of around Rs 15 crore a week.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/transporters-cant-afford-another-lockdown/articleshow/88743820.cms||Christin Mathew Philip
---||Bengaluru||HC upholds ordinance on answer scripts||Bengaluru: The high court has upheld an ordinance issued by Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences (RGUHS) governing the Central Assessment Programme (CAP) for theory paper assessment in MBBS, applicable to exams held on or after February 1, 2021. CAP provides for “general valuation” by any two eligible internal examiners from affiliated institutes of RGUHS. In addition, a “deviation valuation” is also provided when the difference in award of total marks between the two examiners is 15% or more of the maximum marks prescribed for the paper. In such circumstances, it would be referred to a third internal examiner for evaluation.Two first-year MBBS students had challenged the ordinance, claiming it resulted in gross discrimination between the nature of evaluation, consideration of marks, and yardstick proposed to be adopted for ironing out differences in evaluation. They also claimed they would have automatically passed as they were eligible as per the Regulations of Graduate Medical Education, 1997, which provide grace marks of up to five. However, dismissing their petitions, justice Sachin Shankar Magadum observed that medical students are required to maintain high academic integrity. “Medical students are placed on a higher pedestal because of their crucial role in the healthcare system. They have to work hard and earn their degree in a fair and honest way by putting in hours to study and completing assignments,” the judge noted.He pointed out that the ordinance notification was placed at a meeting of the committee of academic council on February 1, 2021, and approved by it.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/hc-upholds-ordinance-on-answer-scripts/articleshow/88743821.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Greco-Roman designs with a modern twist enthral many new house owners||BENGALURU: In a move away from contemporary designs, classical designs with open, semi-open courtyards, ancient columns and arched entrances are growing in popularity among new house owners in the city. These designs include Italian Renaissance elements like an arched entranceway, neoclassical statues with a waterbody, a feature wall façade and beige flooring with marble inlay works, among others. The return of the trend is because of the increasing need among people to add cultural elements to the interiors of homes and create something new, different from the modern minimalist designs that had been popular for some time now. Anirudh Joshi, a businessman and his wife Sarika, a homemaker, chose several components of Greco-Roman architecture for their home near Hebbal. “The façade, pillars and even the beadings inside the home will have the touch of classical architecture. It had been on my mind since my trip to Italy eight years ago to have the touch of European architecture in my home,” Joshi said, adding the monotony of seeing similar contemporary designs in every flat prompted him to execute the idea. “It will be just like any three-bedroom house, but with pillars, symmetry and designs that will give you a glimpse of an Athenian temple,” he said. D Suresh Kumar of DSK Architects said in the last four years, they have seen a steady increase in clients requesting classical designs in their homes. “We design a brief of classical designs from our research of Greco-Roman architecture from 15th to 18th century and show it to our clients interested in the trend,” he said, adding Victorian designs are also growing in popularity across the globe. According to him, classical designs, that are equated with luxury, are not just popular among the elite, but even the upper middle-class. This has pushed designers to innovate with materials like replacing wooden beading with POP, which brings down the cost, yet the outcome of the genre isn’t disturbed. “One of our projects — JRC Palladio — is the best example of a classical-styled gated society with semi-luxurious approach. Designing and planning of the entire property are influenced by Greek-Roman architecture and inspired by the approach of Italian architect Andrea Palladio,” he said. Paushika Gupta, founder of Paushika Gupta Architecture and Design, said the charm and elegance of classical designs never go out of style. “The new classicism trend is overall cleaner, less cluttered in appearance and it matches up to today’s desire of easy upkeep,” Gupta said, adding the younger population is enthralled by urns, mouldings, columns, swags in both drapery and decorative motifs, architectural nods-domes, cornicing, use of marble and murals. Rohit Suraj, Urban Zen’s founder and CEO, said exposure through online platforms like Houzz, Pinterest, Archdaily and Dezeen, has increased awareness. “Architects and interior designers are constantly faced with clients coming in with preconceived notions of what they want. The challenge is to stand out in a distinguished way,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/greco-roman-designs-with-a-modern-twist-enthral-many/articleshow/88743823.cms||Farheen Hussain

---||Bengaluru||FC Bengaluru retain Super Division crown||Bengaluru: FC Bengaluru United bounced back from the disappointment of losing out in the I-league qualifiers as they defended their BDFA Super Division league title here on Thursday. The team trained by Richard Hood (head coach) and former India international Gourmangi Singh (assistant coach) ended their campaign in the state's premier league with an unbeaten record and the team’s coronation was confirmed after ASC and Centre held title contenders Kickstart FC to a 3-3 draw at the Football Stadium. The result derailed Kickstart's bid for the title as the team will end with a maximum of 37 points, even if they win their last match, against FCBU's tally of 38 from 14 matches. FCBU won their second straight title registering 12 wins and two draws. They netted a high of 54 goals of which 13 were scored by Slovenian forward Luka Majcen who emerged as the League's top-scorer. Their biggest win was the 9-0 romp against FC Deccan. Hood said he was pleased with team's performance that delivered another trophy in the brief history of the club. "In the first season FCBU finished fifth. After we took over, we first ended in the third spot and then won the next two. The players were determined to put in their best to fight in the I-league qualifiers again,” he told TOI. "It's good way to start the year. Of course (after the disappointment of I-league qualifiers), the win leaves the club in a position to fight for it again,” said Hood who was asked to continue for the Super Division after the team’s setback in the I-league qualifiers. Asked whether the club had a easy run to the title compared to last season when it went to the wire, the coach said: "Last year, we scraped past against BFC by one point after beating Deccan. For the coaching staff this was a short-term assignment after the I-league qualifiers. There were a lot of last-minute signings that came through for us. We didn't have a pre-season and we played the first match after just two training sessions." Results: ASC 3 (Elongbam 10-pen, 50; Tony Huidrom 12) drew with Kickstart Football Club 3 (Solaimalai 81-pen, Sudheer Kotikela 85, Prince Olariche 87).

Currently, the SAI centre is hosting a number of national camps, including athletics and hockey, in which the senior men and women campers and coaching staff number about 140. None of the athletes who tested positive have been hospitalised as they are either asymptomatic or have shown mild symptoms. They have been asked to isolate in their rooms. Their roommates, who have tested negative, too have been quarantined separately. Officials attribute the spike in the cases to the tournaments held in the campus. The South zone inter-university men’s hockey championship, in which 56 teams, comprising 900 players and 80 officials from across south India participated, was held from December 26-30. Earlier, the 3rd Indian Open national para athletics championship was held on December 19 and 20.“While we can’t confirm that the Covid-19 cases are a result of the competitions conducted within the campus over the past two weeks, we had a lot of outsiders in and out of the campus during the period. While there was thermal scanning at the entrance and participants were asked not to go beyond the designated area, it was difficult for us to monitor them,” a source said while indicating that such competitions will no longer be hosted in the premises. Following a surge in the number of cases, SAI on Wednesday issued fresh Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to be implemented at the various National Centres of Excellence and national camps.Safety protocols were ramped up in Bengaluru this week. Athletes are in a micro-bubble with sportspersons from different disciplines not being allowed to interact with each other. They have been split into small groups and practice timings staggered. Like in the case of the first two waves, all staff members coming in contact with the athletes regularly — chefs, cafeteria assistants and cleaning staff — reside within the campus.Also, the Come and Play scheme, through which local athletes have access to facilities across disciplines, has been suspended.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/covid-19-outbreak-at-sai/articleshow/88743831.cms||Manuja Veerappa

The US and the UAE missions — given the high number of Indians there — have the highest case loads. From abandonment or desertion to ill-treatment and physical torture, women continue to suffer from bad marriages. As per the ministry of external affairs (MEA), with the number of overseas Indians increasing, they are receiving several petitions, grievances, and complaints pertaining to marital issues from Indian nationals who are married to overseas Indians. The MEA said it is empowering such Indian nationals by providing information about legal procedures to be followed, filing of court cases, issuance of summons, look-out circulars, revoking or impounding passports, obtaining maintenance and child support, etc. While more than 6,000 complaints from NRI wives have been received by the MEA in the last seven years, as per data accessed by TOI, reply to an RTI query shows that there are 2,156 cases specifically relating to marital disputes. As per the RTI reply, Indian missions in 47 countries are dealing with such cases, with the US accounting for 615 cases and the UAE 586. The data pertains to cases registered between January 2016 and November 2021. “Under a special scheme, the ministry is providing legal and financial assistance to Indian women married to overseas Indians, through lawyers and NGOs empanelled with missions abroad. The scheme is applicable to 51 countries. Petitioners use this assistance to seek redressal from foreign courts on issues such as restoration of conjugal rights, maintenance, contesting ex-parte divorce, custody of children, abuse or harassment by spouse, etc,” an MEA statement on the matter stated. Data from the RTI shows that after the US and the UAE, Singapore (237) has the highest number of such disputes, followed by Saudi Arabia (119), Kuwait (111), the UK (104), and Australia (102). Forty other countries together account for 282 cases. Govindan Nampoothiry, a Kerala-based RTI campaigner who obtained data on the 2,156 cases, told TOI: “As the number of Indians migrating overseas is increasing, a stringent policy to ensure speedy justice as well as relief to the women abandoned by NRI husbands must be framed as early as possible.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/indian-missions-dealing-with-over-2k-nri-marital-disputes/articleshow/88743833.cms||---

After a game of hide and seek for 20 days, he was arrested in Hassan, Karnataka, on Wednesday. Police said the former minister, accused of taking money from people promising them government jobs, had been evading arrest by changing three vehicles — all belonging to Krishnagiri district BJP unit president Ramakrishnan. He had escaped from Hosur into Karnataka and stopped using mobile phones. The Virudhunagar police, who had a warrant for his arrest, missed nabbing him several times. So police teams from Dharmapuri, which borders Karnataka, were called in to help. A team headed by R Sudhakar, IG, West zone, chased him for three days, covering nearly 250km up to Sakleshpur, before arresting him.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/how-missing-car-wheel-cap-helped-cops-nab-tn-ex-min-in-karnataka/articleshow/88743835.cms||Sindhu Kannan

Some pharmacies have disregarded the price cap fixed by the state government and are selling them at a premium.Though the state government has put a cap of 22 on the price of N95 mask, the quality of the mask available at this price is not up to the mark. A reality check by TOI, at pharmacies in Royapettah, Adyar, Taramani, Velachery and Adambakkam on Thursday, revealed that one has to pay 30-50 per cent more to get a good-quality N95 mask. SA Ramesh from Chennai Chemists and Druggists’ Association said, "The government has specified the caps only for ordinary N95 masks and not for five-layered ones or those of higher quality, which are procured at 35 or more per piece. So, it is not feasible to sell them at 22.”Pulse oximeters are being sold at up to 2,000 a piece against the capped price of 1,500. Such practices are more common in standalone drug stores than chain stores.In response, a senior health department official said, “Representatives from the pharmacy fraternity met with top authorities seeking a revision on the capped prices of five items, including surgical gloves. The proposal for a revision is under consideration."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/masks-oximeters-fly-off-shelves-amid-charges-of-profiteering/articleshow/88743838.cms||Ram Sundaram
---||Chennai||Pvt hospital data helps civic body track Covid early||Chennai: The city corporation has identified 87 Covid-19 positive cases by testing 696 patients, who had visited private hospitals and clinics with symptoms of Influenza like Illnesses (ILI). A week ago, the civic body had instructed all private healthcare centres to notify it through mail the details of people who come with symptoms of fever, cold and cough. Following that, a total of 606 hospitals, clinics and CT scan centres sent the data on such people to the civic body. “We get this data from the hospitals daily. This is one of the unique Covid containment strategies of the city corporation,” commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi told TOI. Of the 87 patients who tested positive, 49 are from four zones -- Anna Nagar, Teynampet, Kodambakkam and Alandur. Apparently, the spread of Covid is higher in these zones. The commissioner said, upon intimation from the private healthcare centres, civic body staff visited the patients and collected swab samples from them. “We do not want people who go to private centres to be out of the corporation’s watch. By this way, we are able to trace cases quickly and contain the spread,” he added. Meanwhile, the civic body has sent notices to six hospitals for not sending the data on patients with ILI symptoms. The corporation officials have also found that 119 patients with ILI symptoms had directly gone for a CT scan, without undergoing RTPCR test. They said some of these patients tested positive eventually, and warned people who showed Covid symptoms, not to go for CT scan directly. Recently, in an internal meeting held at Ripon Buildings, the zonal health officials were told to pull up the labs that delayed informing the civic body on patients who underwent RTPCR test, and CT scan and X-ray centres which do not share information on time.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/pvt-hospital-data-helps-civic-body-track-covid-early/articleshow/88743839.cms||---

In a statement he has also sought the state government to release 22 crore for maintenance of the mill and salary disbursement of the employees.Ops said that the mill was not functioning in 2019 – 20 and 2020 – 21 because of poor sugarcane yield. Though the mill was shut, the state government has allotted 39 crores to be paid for sugarcane farmers, salary for mill employees and for the maintenance of the mill.Now that the yield has improved and about 60000 tonnes of sugarcane ready for crushing, government should take steps to resume the functioning of the mill, OPS said. The mill administration has said that they would need 10 crore for maintenance of the equipment and making advance payment for procurement of sugarcane while Rs 11 crore was needed for disbursement of pending salary for the employees. The state government should sanction the amount, OPS said. “About 10000 sugarcane farmers, 500 employees of the mill and scores of tractor, truck drivers, bullock cart owners, load men, traders and contractors would benefit if the mill is reopened,’’ he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/ops-asks-government-to-reopen-madurai-cooperative-sugar-mill/articleshow/88743841.cms||---
---||Chennai||Govt will form panel to probe Smart City project in Chennai||Chennai: Chief minister M K Stalin criticized the erstwhile AIADMK government for the havoc caused by the recent heavy rain in Chennai and said the government would constitute a committee to probe the “ineffective implementation and lapses” in the Smart City project that led to flooding in T Nagar and other parts of the city.Even in 2015 when water was released from Chembarambakkam reservoir, T Nagar was not flooded. “When it took just two days to dewater the flooded areas in other parts of Chennai, it took one week to clear the waterlogging in T Nagar,” said the CM, replying to charges by leader of the opposition Edappadi K Palaniswami that the government had failed to take precautionary measures ahead of the northeast monsoon.Minister for municipal administration and urban water supply K N Nehru recalled Palaniswami’s election campaign speech and said his (EPS) government had spent Rs 1000 crore to improve the infrastructure in Chennai on the assurances that not a single drop of water would stagnate. The recent rain exposed the fallacy in that propaganda, said Nehru.The minister further pointed to the “poor implementation” of the Smart City project and wondered what the AIADMK regime had done for the last 10 years. “The debris generated during the Smart City project in T Nagar was dumped in Mambalam canal, obstructing the free flow of the rainwater and resulted in flooding of T Nagar,” said the minister EPS refuted the charges and said that his regime was not responsible for the recent flooding of Chennai. It was because of “the inefficiency of the present government” in taking up routine measures such as desilting the storm water drains ahead of the monsoon, said EPS.  But Nehru said, “If the previous government had done its work properly, we would not have faced the problem (flooding and waterlogging). The work on storm water drains under the Smart City project in Chennai has not been carried out properly.” Not only Chennai, Tirunelveli, Trichy and several places in TN too faced similar problems. “Our government under the able leadership of our CM has expedited the restoration work. We engaged 6,100 motor pumps in Chennai alone to pump out the stagnated rain waters in low lying areas during the recent rains,” said the minister.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/govt-will-form-panel-to-probe-smart-city-project-in-chennai/articleshow/88743842.cms||---
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin announces all-party meet on January 8 to discuss NEET||CHENNAI: As governor R N Ravi has not sent the NEET Bill to President Ram Nath Kovind and Union home minister Amit Shah refused to meet an all-party delegation of MPs, chief minister M K Stalin said on Thursday, a meeting of legislature parties will take place on January 8 to decide the next course of action in the fight to get exemption for Tamil Nadu from NEET. The main opposition AIADMK extended its support for a “joint struggle” against the entrance examinations for admission to medical and dental courses. Making a suo motu statement in the assembly, the chief minister said the struggle for social justice and against NEET would continue based on the outcome of the meeting. The Union government snatched away the rights of the state governments in deciding admission of students to medical colleges though colleges are being funded by the state government from the state funds. NEET benefited only those students who had access to undergo training for entrance examinations. It rendered school education system meaningless, he said. “These actions not only shatter the dreams of the students but undermine the federal principles. We cannot remain spectators. We cannot remain indifferent to the future of our students being ruined,” the CM said, recalling the unanimous passage of the NEET Bill in September and his meeting with the governor in November to get assent to the Bill. The previous DMK regime had scrapped entrance test for professional courses in 2007. The chief minister said that a delegation of MPs from all parties led by DMK parliamentary party leader T R Baalu presented a memorandum to President Ram Nath Kovind’s secretariat on December 28, explaining the delay in getting assent to the Bill. The memorandum was forwarded to the Union home ministry for action on the same day. “Following this, an appointment was sought from the Union home minister by an all-party delegation of MPs, but the minister is refusing to meet the delegation. Refusing to meet elected members is against the ethos of democracy,” the CM said. The representation that was to be handed over to the minister was submitted to his office on Wednesday. AIADMK member Vaithilingam raised doubts about the government’s efforts given that the NEET Bill passed by the previous AIADMK government did not get assent. Hence, the previous government enacted a legislation to provide horizontal reservation of 7.5% for government school students that helped 435 students pursue medical education. “We extend 100% support to the fight for getting NEET exemption. We are ready to protest with you. But is it possible?” Vaithilingam urged the government to train students to face the entrance test and not ruin the future of students.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/cm-announces-all-party-meet-on-january-8-to-discuss-neet/articleshow/88743843.cms||---

The minister invited the opposition members to join him for an on-the-spot inspection. The DMK government decided to shut down the clinics since it was a temporary scheme as per a government order issued by the previous AIADMK regime, the minister said. “I am ready to take a group of MLAs from your side. I will come with journalists to show you the clinics set up by converting a toilet and a burial ground. You passed an order saying the scheme was initially sanctioned for a period of one year and based on the need and performance, a decision would be taken for further continuance. It is not necessary now because 43lakh people benefitted from our Makkalai Thedi Maruthuvam (healthcare at the doorstep) scheme,” Subramanian said. When former chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami intervened to say the minister was belittling the scheme that was conceived to help the poor, chief minister M K Stalin said the minister was ready to take the opposition members on an inspection tour.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/amma-clinics-on-erstwhile-toilet-burial-ground-says-minister/articleshow/88743844.cms||---

Participating in the debate on a motion of thanks for the governor's speech in the assembly on Thursday, leader of opposition Edappadi K Palaniswami vowed to support the TN government’s efforts to do away with NEET and “eliminate the disparity” between the rural and urban students in pursuing medicine. E R Eswaran of Kongunadu Makkal Desia Katch criticized the AIADMK MLAs, “who raised doubts” about the efforts taken by the Tamil Nadu government to do away with NEET. He said that certain people were calling the government measure “a vain attempt”. Chief minister M K Stalin’s effort was nothing but a “pursuing effect” that would definitely pay off, said Eswaran. VCK floor leader M Sinthanai Selvan, PMK leader G K Mani, Congress leader K Selvaperunthagai, T Velmurugan of Tamizhaga Vazhvurimai Katchi, and MLAs of the CPI and CPM expressed confidence over the efforts taken by the Stalin-led government to free the state from NEET.

---||Chennai||Fearing tax revenue loss, TN delays BH regn of vehicles||Chennai: Worried about tax revenue drops, Tamil Nadu has remained indecisive on implementation of the new Bharat (BH) series registration for personal vehicles.Cars and two-wheelers, registered under the BH series, will get special number plates which will be valid across the country.The move, proposed by the Union road transport ministry in September, was aimed at helping government and private employees, who frequently get transferred to other Indian states. They need not change their vehicle registration numbers after every transfer. While several states/Union territories like Maharashtra, Karnataka and Puducherry have already rolled out this scheme, Tamil Nadu is yet to take a policy decision in this regard, according to official documents dated January 4.Explaining the rationale behind the hesitancy, a senior state transport department official said, "We have already lost enough revenue because of the lockdowns and BH-series might reduce it further". At present, TN collects 10% to 15% of the four-wheeler cost as road tax. The vehicle cost includes Goods and Service Tax (GST). But under the proposed BH series, a state can collect only up to 12% of the vehicle cost and that too the tax amount will be calculated excluding the GST. This means that TN might lose a tax revenue of several lakhs everyday, the official added.Rejecting these claims, Harshavardhan Hebsur, a BH series aspirant, said that the tax slabs for BH vehicles were based on recommendations made by the group of state transport ministers. The ministry in a recent meeting clarified that the tax proposed is 1.25 times more and it will go to the respective state, he said.Hesbur with 50 other aspirants has formed a group, which has tried to put pressure on TN regarding this by repeatedly petitioning and meeting top authorities. "While some of us booked the vehicle after paying the full amount, others are paying their monthly instalments. But the state is yet to decide. Some have started cancelling their new bookings," he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/fearing-tax-revenue-loss-tn-delays-bh-regn-of-vehicles/articleshow/88743847.cms||Ram Sundaram

Sanjeev Bhatia of the 99 Cannons Motorcycle Club said that riding a bullet for more than 6,400 kilometres on the Golden Quadrilateral Road is a significant feat, and it is a proud movement for Hubballi. Riding on this route is the best way to learn about India. It introduces one to distinct food, culture and language. A 27-year-old rider from Pune completed the journey in five days. The journey is fraught with risk in several places, especially in Odisha, Jharkhand and Andhra Pradesh borders. It impressive that a 65-year-old man from Hubballi completed the journey in 14 days, he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/65-yr-old-man-completes-6400kms-ride-in-14-days/articleshow/88741823.cms||J Abbas Mulla

Harshavardhan Sheelavant has recorded in pictures and videos what he calls the slow killing of trees. He said some people peel away at the stems and leave the bruised tree like that a few days. As the damaged stem and roots don’t get enough water and nourishment because of the damage, the tree dries out and dies. Later, they submit applications demanding that the dried dead tree be chopped off. Harshavardhan told TOI that a big tree is being killed at Kuvempu Road, Navanagar, Hubballi. “The circumference of the stem is about 123 inches and its peel is being chiselled out regularly. Once the peel is chiselled out, tree goes dry gradually. Probably the same miscreants also apply for the felling of the tree and get a nod from the forest department,” he said. He said that although he had drawn attention of the forest department, the HDMC and elected representatives through Facebook and Twitter to this practice, no one has acted or responded. Yashpal Kshirsagar, the deputy conservator of forests in the Dharwad division, said: “We are authorised to permit the cutting of trees that are unsafe for citizens. There are some rules before issuing permission. However, we are not entitled to keep a vigil on the practice of killing trees slowly. In Bengaluru, BBMP has its own mechanism. In other cities, it’s not clear. However, if we receive any complaint, we will attend and prevent such efforts.” Rajanna, a shopkeeper in Dharwad, said that such a practice has been on for years. “Many times, the lack of coordination between departments like the forest, Hescom, HDMC, push citizens to cut trees illegally. A citizen in Navanagar had approached the forest department requesting to cut a tree because its branches were touching power cables a year go. Hescom switched off the power supply but the forest personnel did not make it to the spot. This went for six months. Then, the resident paid a bribe to a contractor and it was cut in a day,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/activists-hint-at-conspiracy-to-slowly-kill-trees-in-twin-cities/articleshow/88741784.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

The district has 474 licensed meat shops, though officials and animal lovers believe that the actual figure is way higher. “Only a few are registered, while the ones flouting norms are barely checked. These shops are not supposed to be near places of worship but there is one in Selaqui that isn’t following the norms. Also, these shops are not supposed to keep live animals but goats and chickens are often spotted there. Also, there is no check on hygiene,” said Rubina Nitin Iyer, member, society for prevention of cruelty to animals. She said that they have also filed complaints with local police and district magistrate. “Food safety department is tasked with licensing. We are looking at overall monitoring and prioritising animal welfare,” said a senior veterinary officer. Meanwhile, food safety department has claimed that it is looking into the matter. “It is on our agenda to monitor meat shops in the district. We will work with other departments to ensure that the norms are not flouted. There are several shops that are running without licenses and we will take action against them,” said Prem Kumar Joshi, DO, food safety. Officials said that shops running without licenses can be fined up to Rs 1 lakh and for repeat offenders, it can go up to Rs 5 lakh. The district has challaned 53 such shops in the past year. Efforts will be stepped up to ensure that unlicensed shops are shut down in the coming days, officials said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/action-sought-against-unlicensed-meat-shops-in-doon/articleshow/88741247.cms||Tanmayee Tyagi

The massive surge in Covid-19 cases in the city has led to the situation. Till December, the situation was such that many hospitals were not keen on taking in Covid patients. But things have turned around rapidly. For instance, only nine persons from the city were hospitalised on December 23. Against this, hospitalisation increased to 104 on Thursday. Sources said that while the ratio of hospitalised patients was very low, the steep rise in the number of new cases reported daily has changed the situation. The discharge rate has also remained low as the number of new cases reported was very less about a week back. They added that till the wave was on the rise, the number of active cases and even hospitalisations will continue to increase. Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) medical officer (health) Dr Devesh Patel said that the city was presently prepared to handle hospitalisations. “We already have an existing capacity of around 6,000 beds in the city,” he said. Patel added that the infrastructure and plans remained in place to increase the bed capacity. “We can do what we did during the second wave,” he added. The number of patients needing ventilator or BIPAP machines, however, has not increased significantly. It had reached six patients from one recently but has come down to three again.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/covid-hospitalisation-crosses-100-mark/articleshow/88742300.cms||Sachin Sharma

This led to a global selloff in stocks. As a result, the sensex fell over 900 points in early trades on Thursday and closed 621 points, or 1%, lower at 59,602 with Reliance Industries, HDFC Bank and Infosys contributing the most to the loss. The sensex closed lower after four consecutive sessions of gains, during which it had added nearly 2,500 points. The rising number of new Covid infections daily across the country, which could potentially derail the slow and fragile economic revival process, is also making market players nervous. On Wednesday night, the Dow Jones index witnessed a late selloff while the tech-heavy Nasdaq closed over 3% down. On Thursday, Nikkei in Japan closed nearly 3% off while the FTSE in the UK was down nearly 1% in late sessions. In early trades in the US, most leading indices were down between 0.4% and 1%. Analysts and market players said the US Fed’s hawkish statement could mean a faster end to its easy-money policy, which in turn could lead to some selling by foreign funds in emerging market economies that include India. End of the session data on the BSE showed that in Thursday’s market, foreign funds were net sellers at Rs 1,927 crore — the first such net outflow figure in 2022. According to Motilal Oswal Financial Services head (retail research) Siddhartha Khemka, rising Covid cases and stricter restrictions being imposed too contributed to the negative sentiment in the market. “Global markets witnessed a selloff after minutes from the Federal Reserve’s meeting pointed to a faster-than-expected rise in interest rates due to concerns about persistent inflation. (In 2022), the focus of central bankers across the world has shifted towards inflation and monetary policy normalisation since the pandemic, given the context of US Fed tapering and potential hardening of interest rates (during the year),” Khemka wrote in a post-market note. In the next few weeks, a host of factors would decide the market’s path, market players said. These include potential risks from the spread of the Omicron variant, the upcoming Budget in less than a month, earnings momentum and also the macro-economic data — from India and from other developed countries.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sensex-falls-621-points-on-hawkish-us-fed-omicron/articleshow/88742208.cms||---

Companies have started telling employees to work from home (WFH) and play it safe. Companies that had opened their doors for employees to voluntarily come and work from offices since September-October last year are now asking them to go back to WFH mode. HR representatives say all eyes are on state guidelines and restrictions around the current wave. With government departments declaring 50% attendance for its personnel, the private sector is also shelving plans to get employees back to office.Various companies TOI spoke to — including large employers such as Cognizant, Amazon, Flipkart and new age startups such as Razorpay said they have asked employees to re-adopt WFH. They plan to reassess the situation and decide on a working model. Senior executives and team leads at large IT services firms who had voluntarily started working from office are back to their home offices. Most of the IT firms had decided to bring in close to 70% staff from January, and those plans are now uncertain. Cognizant said it aims to return to office in April, given the uncertain path of the Omicron variant and global outbreaks. “Until then, travel and office-based work will remain restricted. The health and safety of our employees and contractors, their families, our clients and our communities remain our top priority,” a statement from the company said. “Flipkart has been flexible in its approach and created a hybrid model for all our corporate employees, that combines campus and remote work options starting December 2021. In view of the rising cases, we’ve advised our employees to not come into the office for the next two weeks,” a Flipkart spokesperson said. An Amazon India spokesperson said that the majority of the company’s employees are working from home at the moment. Amazon added that they are monitoring the situation closely and will consider the health and safety of employees in making any decision. Most global captive centres (GCCs) had devised global plans to welcome teams in India back to office in a rostered manner from the current month. But they have now told employees that such plans stand cancelled until further notice, and WFH will continue, industry sources said. American firm BNY Mellon, which has presence in Mumbai, Chennai and Pune, said in a statement that they are considering guidance from the medical community and will provide employees with at least 30 days’ notice on eventual return date. The company had previously been allowing vaccinated employees who want to work from the office to do so, subject to local regulations. Most startups and new age digital companies were largely remote and, while some employees had started coming together at offices for better morale, they are back to WFH mode. Fintech major Razorpay has been practicing a hybrid model since offices in Bangalore, Mumbai and Gurgaon re-opened in 2021 and few employees were coming in of their own will. “But as and when we see a surge in Covid cases, we shut down our offices in interest of employee safety. Given the current scenario, we are all working from home. We will continue to monitor the situation and take a call post-January 15 on when the office can reopen,” a spokesperson for Razorpay said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/cos-re-adopt-wfh-on-omicron/articleshow/88742011.cms||Sindhu Hariharan
---||Business||Banks can tag more of small biz deposits as stable||MUMBAI: In a move that will make it easier for smaller banks to comply with Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI’s) prudential norms, the central bank has allowed lenders to recognise deposits of up to Rs 7.5 crore by small businesses for purpose of maintaining liquidity coverage ratio (LCR). The earlier threshold for a deposit being part of the LCR was Rs 5 crore. “While the circular intends to align the definition of small business customer across different circulars, it will also have a collateral impact of improving LCR for banks,” said an analyst. The LCR requirement was introduced as part of post-Global Financial Crisis (GFC) reforms by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) — the international association of banking regulators. The idea behind this is that a bank should at all times have liquid assets to meet 30 days’ net outgo under stressed conditions. The LCR is measured by dividing the value of high-quality liquid assets (including government bonds) that a bank holds by the expected outgo in 30 days. While measuring outflows, small business deposits are considered as sticky deposits with lower run-off. When the ticket size of small deposits is increased from Rs 5 crore to Rs 7.5 crore, it means that the quantum of hot money that can go out will decrease and thus improve the bank’s LCR. The revision in LCR norms comes at a time when the RBI is normalising some of the liquidity that it has created for banks to tide over the pandemic. Corporate deposits are considered as hot money and not stable deposits as they are parked for business use. Smaller deposits are considered stable as they also form part of savings. “With the objective to better align our guidelines with the BCBS standard and enable banks to manage liquidity risk more effectively, it has been decided to increase the threshold limit for deposits and other extensions of funds made by non-financial small business customers,” the RBI said in a circular.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/banks-can-tag-more-of-small-biz-deposits-as-stable/articleshow/88742268.cms||---

It raised $1.5 billion in a 10-year tranche, $1.75 billion in a 30-year and $750 million in a 40-year deal. It had recently received board approval to raise up to $5 billion in foreign bonds to take advantage of the low interest rate environment and to refinance existing borrowings. The bond issue was subscribed nearly three times with peak order book aggregating $11.5 billion. The bonds were bought by investors from Asia (53%), America (33%) and Europe (14%). It was the largest foreign currency bond issuance from India, RIL claimed, dwarfing the earlier record set by energy major ONGC Videsh when it raised $2.2 billion in dollars notes in 2014. Bharti Airtel had raised $1.25 billion in 2021, which was the biggest debt issue last year. The jumbo foreign currency bond issue was the largest debt capital market transaction at $4 billion and the “tightest credit spreads across each of the long-dated tenors for any corporate in India”, said RIL joint chief financial officer Srikanth Venkatachari. “The support received from the marquee international capital market investors is reflective of the strength of our underlying businesses with established growth platforms across energy, consumer and technology as well as robustness of our balance sheet.” RIL did not divulge the name of the subscribers of the bonds. But, industry sources said the subscribers included Fidelity, Pacific Investment Management Co (Pimco), Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM), Metlife, Eastspring, NeubergerBerman, Blackrock and Lombard Odier. The bonds will be listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange. Industry observers said RIL achieved a low interest rate as investors are betting on the India growth story, among other factors. “Despite heavy competing calendar at the beginning of the year, RIL printed the lowest ever 30-year coupon and the lowest ever reoffer spread on a 10-year bond from an Indian issuer,” said Bank of America India head Kaku Nakhate. Agreeing with Nakhate was Citi India CEO Ashu Khullar. “RIL achieved lowest coupon for benchmark 30- and 40-year issuances by any private sector corporate in BBB space from Asia, ex-Japan. This is also the first ever 40-year issuance from India taking advantage of current low-rate environment to elongate debt maturity,” said Khullar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rils-4bn-foreign-currency-bonds-issue-is-indias-biggest/articleshow/88742284.cms||---

Hearing of the case is going on. I assure that online gaming will be put to an end shortly,” he said, amid loud thumping of desks in the treasury. Earlier, AIADMK MLA R Vaithlingam drew the attention of the House to the recent suicides of a bank official and his family in Chennai due to online gaming, while the AIADMK regime led by J Jayalalithaa had destroyed the lotteries and kandhi vatti (money lending) in the state.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/cm-govt-will-end-online-gaming-soon/articleshow/88743850.cms||---

The driver reportedly lost control due to fog-reduced visibility. The deceased, identified as P Selvam, 29, J Sundaramoorthy, 30, and M Saravanan, 27, were residents of Ariyalur district. They were on the way to Tiruvallur district to set up a new water business. Police said Sundaramoorthy had planned to set up a new shop providing water cans in Tiruvallur district. They had planned to stay at their friends’ house in Kancheepuram and then proceed to Thiruvallur on Thursday morning. The trio was driving along Perunagar at around 1.30 am when their car collided with the van. The three died on the spot. The van with 13 people was on its way to Melmaruvathur from Chengalpattu district. Based on the information, a case was registered. The bodies were sent for a postmortem to the Kancheepuram Government Hospital. Police suspect, Selvam, who was driving the vehicle would have lost control due to poor visibility.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/three-die-as-car-collides-with-van-in-kanchi/articleshow/88743852.cms||---

The MLA was referring to the upcoming bus terminus at Kilambakkam. According to the initial plan, an elevated line covering 15.3km was to link the airport at Meenambakkam with Kilambakkam through stations in at least 13 locations. The line was to link several densely populated suburbs like Pallavaram, Chromepet, Tambaram, Perungalathur, and Vandalur. The line, which may run parallel to the suburban train network, will also link several landmarks like Tambaram railway station, Arignar Anna Zoological Park at Vandalur and the moffusil bus terminus coming up at Kilambakkam.  The passengers will take about 40 minutes to reach airport from Kilambakkam once the bus terminus gets ready by the end of this year. They could also take a direct train to Central, which may take an hour, or switch corridors at Alandur or Central to reach Egmore.  When the construction of phase-2 metro rail project is completed, passengers from southern suburbs like Pallavaram and Tambaram could travel to Madhavaram in the northern suburbs via the airport.  Residents in suburbs now want the government to expedite work to build a metro line to link Tambaram with Velachery to ease travel for those living in the ECR and OMR IT corridor. CMRL is linking the OMR IT corridor from Thiruvanmiyur to Siruseri SIPCOT in phase-2 project. “When people living in OMR or ECR arrive at Tambaram, they spend a lot on cabs to reach their destination. If the Tambaram to Velachery line, announced by the previous government, also materialises, then people can easily switch trains and travel between Tambaram and the IT corridor,” said V Seetharaman, general secretary, Federation of residents welfare association in Tambaram.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/govt-moots-new-airport-metro-line/articleshow/88743853.cms||---

According to the bill, developers find it difficult to obtain fresh permission on expiry of the five-year period, in cases where construction projects are yet to be completed. Further, Covid-19 had impacted activity in the real estate sector in the state. The interdependence of supply chains, migration of labour, cost overturns and liquidity constraints are some of the challenges the sector faced. So it would be difficult to complete projects within five years.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/govt-plans-to-extend-validity-of-planning-permissions/articleshow/88743855.cms||---

Hence, Justice S Vaidyanathan has suggested appropriate amendments to the Act to enable a labour court or a tribunal to decide the issues. “The ID Act needs to be amended to enable a labour court or tribunal to decide the issue, as the IAS officers, who are entrusted with such quasi-judicial work, lack familiarity with the strict provisions of the Act on account of their other administrative / official duties,” the judge said. The issue pertains to two petitions moved by Swadeshi Panchalai Thozilalar Urimai Padukappu Sangam seeking to quash notices issued by Swadeshi Cotton Mill and Sri Bharathi Mills regarding closure of the mills. According to the petitioners, the mills are in existence for more than 90 years and on account of loss, it has been decided to wind up the mills by means of filing a closure application under Section 25-O of the Industrial Disputes Act. The management has issued a closure notice dated September 29, 2020, indicating that the mills would be closed with effect from September 30, 2020. The grievance of the sangam was that when a specific provision is stipulated under the act, it is the duty cast upon the authority concerned to hear necessary and proper parties, including the aggrieved parties, and pass orders on the application in respect of closure of mills. The court set aside the notices and directed the mills to follow the due procedure under the law.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/labour-issues-best-left-to-courts-to-decide-says-hc/articleshow/88743857.cms||---

Both the killings took place in a span of 30 minutes. The deceased, identified as M Karthik, 27, alias ‘Appu’ Kathik from K K Street, and S Mahesh, 22, from Mettu Street, were related to each other. They were employed at the vegetable wholesale market in Chengalpet district. The first incident took place at 7.30 pm when the gang hurled a country bomb at Karthik while he was having tea at the bus stand. When the entire area was engulfed in smoke, they attacked Karthik with a machete, leaving his face disfigured. Those gathered at the bus stand raised an alarm when the gang threatened them before fleeing on a bike. The same gang reached Mettu Street, a 10-minute ride from the bus stand, and entered the house of Mahesh while he was watching television. They hacked Mahesh to death, leaving him in a pool of blood. Mahesh and Karthik were rushed to the Chengalpattu Government Hospital where the doctors declared them dead on arrival. The Chengalpattu Town police have registered a case and further investigations are on. According to the police, Karthik is accused of two murders, while Mahesh doesn’t have any previous cases. Police are trying to establish the motive behind the killings. "Since the deceased are related to each other, we are trying to establish the links that led to the murders," an investigating officer said. Police are examining the CCTV footage from the area to identify the assailants.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/double-murder-by-gang-of-three-rocks-chengalpet/articleshow/88743858.cms||---

The court added that it could take up the plea for hearing on January 11.According to the petitioner, in 2016, municipal laws were amended to provide 50% of the seats in local bodies to be reserved for women.Pointing out the anomaly in reserving seats over and above 50% in Chennai corporation, senior advocate S Prabakaran representing the petitioner said, “the phrase ‘not less than 50%’ should not be construed to mean that reservation for women can be provided even beyond 50%.”Pointing out a government order issued in 2019, the petitioner said, 16 seats of Chennai corporation have been reserved to scheduled castes, 16 to scheduled caste women and 89 to women in general category.“Of the 200 seats, 105 seats have been reserved for women both in SC and general category. But as per the 50% reservation for women policy only 84 seats should have been allotted in general category. But flouting the norm more seats have been allocated discriminating men,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/no-bar-to-holding-urban-civic-polls/articleshow/88743863.cms||---

The survey by LocalCircles said that many parents, though concerned about the effectiveness of online education, were more worried about absence of social distancing and poor ventilation in classrooms. Across the country, 52% of parents said that they did not want to send children to school due to rising Covid-19 cases in their districts or cities. The survey had 11,000 respondents from across the country of which 2,109 were in Telangana. “We as a country are going into a critical period and the risk of a large number of children getting infected with Omicron leading to more infections in their families is very high. Unless a district or city is free of Covid-19 or has really low levels of TPR, our recommendation to central and state governments would be to switch to online education and enable the same via mediums like internet, television, radio, etc. for rural locations,” said Sachin Taparia, founder, LocalCircles. Private school managements in the state also said that it looked unlikely that physical classes would be resumed after Sankranti vacation. “The state might direct educational institutions to continue in online mode before January 16 because of the prevailing Covid-19 situation,” said K Praveen Raju, president, Independent School Managements Association. He said his school, Suchitra Academy International School, has already shifted to online mode because of the surge in cases. Y Shekhar Rao, president, Telangana Recognised School Management Association, also said that offline classes may soon be stooped. “I don’t think parents will be willing to send their children back to schools after January 16 as the number of Covid-19 cases is increasing exponentially.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/70-parents-in-t-against-offline-classes-survey/articleshow/88743864.cms||---

On Wednesday, the positivity rate touched nearly 3.6 per cent, remaining around that mark on Thursday too as the state recorded 1,913 positives through 54,534 tests.

The state also saw two more deaths, taking the overall death toll as a result of the pandemic to 4,036. Another 232 patients were declared recovered by authorities on Thursday, with total recoveries now touching 6,75,573.

---||Hyderabad||State: No need to report Omicron cases separately||Hyderabad: The state health department on Thursday said that it would no longer disclose the number of Omicron cases. The department reasoned that there was no point in reporting Omicron case numbers separately as most cases now being reported are of the new variant. According to its last update disclosing Omicron figures, the state was reported to have 94 cases of the variant. However, most of these cases were of persons who had travelled to Hyderabad from abroad and their contacts. With the cases now widespread, it is believed that the Omicron variant is now widespread and it is no longer possible to have each sample testing positive sent for genome sequencing. “...It is not required because ultimately the treatment is the same. We can safely assume that majority of the people testing positive for Covid-19 now are infected with the Omicron variant,” a health official said.

The judge, who heard the state, the university and the civic authorities, said that there was no lawful allotment and delivery of possession of the entire extent of 2,324 acres of land to the university. “There is no GO or conveyance deed to show the transfer of land to the varsity,” the judge said. UoH is Telangana’s first central university granted in 1974 by the then Union government in recognition of the sacrifices made by scores of local youth while fighting for a separate Telangana state in 1969. Further, the judge pointed out, the university itself had requested the state through a letter (dated December 26, 2013) to alienate 1,785 acres to it. A high-level committee appointed by the state recommended that 1,626 acres could be allotted to the university and 159 acres reserved for public purposes. Moreover, the university had also entered into an MoU with the state government in February 2004 and gave away 534 acres of its land to the state for handing it over to IMG Bharat company for developing sports facilities, the judge said. This later turned out to be a scam and the state resumed the land from the accused in the scam. The university did not even ask the state to resume the land to it. On the tussle over laying the road in 18 acres of land, the judge said that this was part and parcel of the 159 acres which was earmarked for public purposes. Further, the said land was taken over by the GHMC pursuant to May 2017 letter of Rangareddy district collector. A blacktop road was laid. High tension electrical lines were passing over this land. Under these circumstances, it cannot be held that the university was deprived of its property or there was a denial of equality before the law to it, the judge said. Further, there were many factual aspects in the writ petition such as claiming vested ownership and continuous possession over 2,300 acres of land by the university. On the other hand, a serious dispute was raised by the state on the very allotment of 2,300 acres, the judge said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/hc-junks-uoh-plea-against-road-says-no-proof-land-belongs-to-it/articleshow/88743896.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

Kovvada Swapna, who hails from AP’s Srikakulam, is popular on social media as Swapnika not only for her art works but also for the lively videos she does. Swapnika, who has completed her graduation, has come to the rescue of an orphaned girl by taking care of her. Swapnika, a talented artist, wields the pencil with her mouth to create portraits after both her hands had to be surgically severed following an accident in which she touched a live electric wire in 2007 in Hyderabad. “When some people suggested to my mother that she should give up hopes on me, she refused to listen to them. As there was no money, she had to wait for three days to get some financial assistance to get a surgery done to severe the affected portion of my hands,” Swapnika recalled about her mother Saraswati. In the last two years, during the Covid-19 lockdown, Swapnika identified those who were in need of clothes, food items and other things and went around villages distributing them near her village in Srikakulam. She worked closely with some NGOs and individuals, including distributing materials that cricketer Hanuma Vihari provided. Actor Sonu Sood has also been of help. With some financial assistance that she got, she set up a bangle shop near her village, which has not been doing well because of the pandemic. It was when she was in ninth standard that she learnt to draw holding a pencil with her teeth. The mouth artist has created more than 100 portraits, including those of film stars in the last three years. “I sell the portraits for a small amount but there are some who looking at my physical condition show their generosity by offering more money. It is this money that makes me think of those who are less fortunate than me and help them out,” Swapnika told TOI. She is in Hyderabad to hone her skills as an artist now. Seeing her enthusiasm in wanting to help others, a social worker got blankets and got them distributed through her. Swapnika and her mother get a monthly pension from the Andhra Pradesh government. She wishes to get a government job so as to sustain her family. “I have never ever got discouraged. I have been a fighter all through. This is also the reason why I decide to help, especially the disabled, in their times of distress,” Swapnika said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/swapnika-charts-new-course-on-canvas-to-help-the-needy/articleshow/88743902.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

Police launched a manhunt to nab Mumbai-based Nigerian peddler Tony and police are devising a plan to act against consumers to reduce the demand for drugs from the city. The accused from the first gang are Imran Babu Shaik (27) of Mumbai, who is the main associate of absconding Tony, and their associate Noor Mohammed Khan (29) of Mumbai, who has been tasked with the duty to peddle the contraband in Hyderabad. According to city police commissioner CV Anand, Tony supplies cocaine through Imran to a team of inter-state peddlers like Noor who, in turn, supplies the contraband to customers of Tony in Hyderabad. “Acting on specific information, our decoy team contacted Noor for cocaine. Noor and Imran came to Hyderabad and checked into Oyo lodge in Punjagutta. Our team arrested them near GVK Mall on Thursday and seized 83 gm of cocaine,” Anand said. The duo told north zone Task Force police they brought about 100 gm of contraband and sold part of it to some clients. Police also seized their cellphones and 30,000 cash. Meanwhile, members of another gang, Syed Khaiser Hussain (30) of Chaderghat, Syed Rashid Ahmed Khan (34) of Gujarat and Najbul Hasan Shaik (24) of Mumbai were arrested at Narayanguda and 15 gm cocaine and 45 gm MDMA were seized from their possession. Hussain, who wanted to supply drugs in the city to make quick money, contacted the other two accused. The trio procured cocaine and MDMA from Mumbai-based supplier Ibrahim for 3,000 a gm to sell the same in Hyderabad for 10,000 a gm, the CP said. The third gang members, AR Anirudh (22) of Dammaiguda and his friend K Avinash (26) of Meerpet, who are addicted to narcotics, decided to sell drugs in the city for a higher price. As per the plan, Anirudh bought Ecstacy pills and LSD blots from an unidentified supplier in Goa. When he along with Avinash was trying to sell the drugs to customers, police arrested them at Trimulgherry crossroads on Thursday. Police seized 27 Ecstasy pills and 17 LSD blots. “As of now, we are focusing only on the supply chain of narcotics. As long as demand is there, supply will continue. Now, we have decided to focus on customers also to reduce demand. We are making a list of customers and will hold talks with various stakeholders including psychiatrists and sociologists on whether to arrest the customers under the NDPS Act or how to go about it,” Anand said. The CP also said that they will hold discussions with consulates of foreign countries and the Centre to address the problem of foreign nationals indulging in peddling.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/seven-drug-peddlers-held-cocaine-mdma-seized/articleshow/88743903.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Next 15 days critical, stricter curbs if spike continues: West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee||KOLKATA: The next 15 days would be critical in the state’s fight against Covid, Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee said on Thursday, adding there “may be stricter restrictions... if the spike continues”. “We have tried to balance life and livelihood while imposing curbs but there may be stricter restrictions if the spike continues,” she said. There was no need to panic but everyone should heed the curbs and exercise utmost caution because of the new variant’s high transmissibility, she added. “Entire families are getting infected because of one person. This variant is sparing no one,” Banerjee said, adding that her drivers and her sister-in-law, too, had tested positive. “My office staff, my two drivers were with me in Gangasagar. They were fine and didn’t realise they had Covid till they tested positive,” the CM said, expressing her ire at “irresponsible beh-aviour and indiscretion”, even singling out her younger brother. “We seem to forget that all of us need to go into isolation if anyone in the family tests positive. My sister-in-law tested positive but my brother tested negative but he still stepped out of home. I am offended. I do not like this. I have asked him to stay at home,” Banerjee said. The CM then outlined the problems with stricter restrictions. “People will ask how they will travel if we stop trains. What do we do? Egoleo dosh, pichholeo dosh (Either way, we will be blamed),” she said. “How long will people shut down life and livelihood? We have tried to provide free rations, health to everyone.” Act strongly against the maskless, CM tells copsBut there was no need to panic, she said, quoting statistics. "Exactly 45,417 people have tested positive between December 30 and January 5, but only 2,920 needed hospitalisation. The positivity rate is 23.1%," she added, urging offices to "encourage working from home". "I have a meeting with the PM on Friday, which I will attend from my Kalighat office," she said. Banerjee asked police to "act strongly" against those not wearing masks. "There are some people who will not listen, not wear masks. I don't believe that the administration can force people to wear masks by arresting and imposing fines," she said, adding that people would have to do this voluntarily for their own safety and that of those around them. "It is not about us any more, it is about keeping our family, the young ones, our friends and neighbours safe. This variant is sparing no one. Experts say the third wave is going to be the last, but it is adding to our anxiety before it goes away," she added, urging people to continue wearing masks and not drop their guard even after the seven-day isolation period was over. This variant's symptoms were deceptive, she said citing experts, adding that it was difficult to tell who had the virus without a test. She also asked the administration to make RT-PCR tests mandatory at inter-state borders and "engage locals and volunteers" if required. "All my senior and important officers are Covid-affected," she said, explaining the challenges confronting the administration. The hospital discharge rate was 97% and the fatality rate was 1.1%, the CM said, adding: "It appears the severity is more in the very old and those with co-morbidities. The government will soon conduct a survey of Covid deaths (in the third wave) to understand who is more at risk." Banerjee also flagged another concern: "About 40% people have still not taken the second dose despite vaccines being available. I would urge everyone to take their vaccines on time. Booster doses can only happen if people are fully vaccinated."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/next-15-days-critical-stricter-curbs-if-spike-continues-cm/articleshow/88743911.cms||---

That means, the vaccine is available to all students who are 14-plus.Board students of both the central boards had taken the first-term examination in December and are waiting for the second term, which is likely to be held in March.

However, a few students are absent bec-ause some of them are down with Covid.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/cbse-prod-to-get-students-jabbed/articleshow/88743916.cms||---
---||Kolkata||All West Bengal University of Health Sciences examinations pushed back||Kolkata: The West Bengal University of Health Sciences on Thursday pushed back all examinations which were due from Friday due to the surge in the Covid situation. The controller of examination at the university notified on Thursday that the examinations stand deferred and will be held only after prior notification of at least a fortnight. The rise in cases has led to deferment or cancellation of many tests. So far, MBBS, BDS, BHMS, BASLP, BPT, BOT, MPhil in Regenerative Medicine and Translational Science, MSc in Human Genetics and MD in Homeopathy have been deferred, an official said. The post-graduate counselling of NEET-qualified students was delayed due to the pandemic and has led to agitations. In most medical colleges, students have been asked to vacate hostels as a number of students and faculty are infected. College authorities are planning to resume online classes.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/all-wbuhs-examinations-pushed-back/articleshow/88743917.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Test at home after work from home: Kol chemists run out of Covid self-test kits||Kolkata: As the number of Covid-19 cases surge in Kolkata and Bengal, sales of self-use test kits and other gadgets, including thermometers and pulse oximeters, have started to rise. People have started to keep a close watch on their health and pharmacies in the city are now scurrying to stock up on them. Rajendra Khandelwal, managing director of Dhanwantari Pharma Group, has not seen such a spike in the sale of self-use Covid-19 test kits in the past couple of months. “In the past four days, we have sold at least 1,000 units of self-use test kits. The demand for thermometers and pulse oximeters is also on the rise,” he said. Self-use Covid-19 test kits had hit the Kolkata market last June, but failed to get much response. After the launch, the central government reduced the GST on it from 12% to 5%, making it more affordable. These test kits can provide results in 15 minutes and are more required in remote areas without better testing infrastructure or laboratories.“We are seeing a quicker movement of the self-use test kits than before. The product initially had a muted response and the number of cases were climbing down at that time. People have started buying the kits again now,” said Somnath Ghosh of Metro Pharma. Rakesh Mehta, who runs Exim Distributor, a distributor for self-use test kits in Bengal, is out of stock. In the past six days, he has sold nearly 50,000 kits. “The demand started to pick up from December 30-31. At present, we are unable to supply to the retailers. New stock of the kits is likely to reach Kolkata by Thursday,” he said. According to him, higher demand for the self-use test kits was seen from south Kolkata in the past six days. “We have also started getting enquiries from Asansol, Midnapore and Burdwan since Tuesday,” he said.Bengal Chemists and Druggists Association thinks the demand is going to increase in the coming weeks. “We will have 20,000 more kits in a day or two. By the end of the week, 65,000 self-use Covid-19 test kits will come to Kolkata. But the customers need to buy from trusted shops only, as counterfeit products have also hit the market,” said Sajal Ganguly, secretary of BCDA.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/test-at-home-after-work-from-home-kol-chemists-run-out-of-covid-self-test-kits/articleshow/88743918.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Surge in Covid now pushes up patient count in ICUs||KOLKATA: The number of Covid-19 infected requiring intensive care treatment is gradually on the rise. Though still significantly lower than what the hospitals had witnessed during the second wave, serious cases have started to trickle in as overall Covid numbers continue to rise sharply in the city and the rest of the state. Currently, among the Covid-19 patients admitted in various hospitals, around 10%-20% are under intensive treatment. “There is a gradual rise in the number of Covid patients needing intensive care treatment. Even 10 days ago, we had just seven patients in the critical care unit. The number has now gone up to 20,” said critical care specialist Sauren Panja at RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences. Doctors said most of those in the ICU now are mostly above 60 years and have comorbid conditions. While about 30% of them had come for treatment of other ailments and Covid-19 was a chance detection, the rest had come for treatment after testing positive. “In the second wave, we had about 50% of total Covid admission requiring care either at the ICU or HDU. This time, the percentage so far is about 20% in my unit. Of the 22 patients requiring ICU treatment, most are above 70 years and have various ailments of the heart, kidney and uncontrolled diabetes. During the last wave, we saw many younger patients needing ICU care,” said pulmonologist Raja Dhar of CMRI. At Belle Vue Clinic, Covid patient count outnumbered those in the non-Covid wards on Thursday. Of all the 183 patients admitted currently, 102 are Covid patients. “The number of patients is rising and hence we have increased the Covid bed count to 125. We have 19 patients in the ICU. But this time, oxygen demand by these critical patients is moderate,” said Belle Vue Clinic CEO Pradip Tondon. “So far, the number of patients needing intensive treatment is still very low as only seven out of 62 Covid patients with us are in the ITU. Thirty of them are above 70 years,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra. In Level IV Covid hospitals like the Infectious Diseases & Beliaghata General (ID&BG) Hospital, the number of patients requiring intensive care is relatively higher. This is because nodal Covid hospitals get serious patients referred from other hospitals. “Those requiring oxygen are mostly patients above 60 years with co-morbidities and also many of them have not taken the vaccine. Some are partly vaccinated,” said Asis Manna, medical superintendent and vice-principal of ID&BG Hospital. Healthcare experts, however, said the pressure on CCUs could go up with the rise in the number of infected. “So far, most cases are mild, including patients getting infected for the second time after recovery from ECMO treatment. But we need about two more weeks to be sure about this trend and not take the current wave lightly, thinking it is going to cause mild illness to all,” said critical care specialist Dipanjan Chatterjee of Medica Superspecialty Hospital.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/surge-in-cov-now-pushes-up-patient-count-in-icus/articleshow/88743919.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Symptoms overlap with common cold’s, prompt call for caution||KOLKATA: As the third wave rages across the city, infecting thousands every day, several more are being infected by non-Covid viruses with symptoms that are almost identical, leading to a divided opinion among doctors on whether and when one should get tested. While a section believes a test is necessary so that the infected can be isolated immediately and a transmission prevented, others point out that the symptomatics should be treated as positives, isolated and given anti-Covid medicines for at least three days instead of waiting for the test result. Adeno virus, rhinovirus, influenza virus and non-novel coronaviruses are on the prowl in Kolkata, warned experts. They strike routinely during this time of the year when temperature fluctuates in winter, they added. “They trigger a bout of cough and cold, body ache and fever. But the difference this time is the fear of Covid which has been leading to a panic. Since transmission has been so rapid this time, we can assume that the majority are Covid positive and should be treated as such. There’s no harm in getting a test done but one shouldn’t wait for the result to isolate,” said CMRI Hospital director of pulmonology Raja Dhar. He added that everyone with symptoms should start taking doxycycline as a safeguard. As the number of Covid patients started leaping last week, thousands have been infected with dry cough, which has worsened leading to body ache and fever, said Belle Vue Clinic internal medicine specialist Rahul Jain. “Most cases have been mild so far and the virus has struck and gone even before many could get tested. But it’s better to get an RT-PCR done or else the infected may unknowingly spread the virus, which is now happening,” said Jain. Those with symptoms, even if they are very mild, should get tested immediately, said Peerless Hospital microbiologist Bhaskar Narayan Chowdhury. “Or else, they will spread the virus. A large number is getting infected by non-Covid viruses, too. But unfortunately, we have an even larger number of asymptomatic positives who have led to this massive spread. Omicron has been mild the world over and this can’t be helped,” said Chowdhury. While getting tested is recommended since symptoms of Covid and other viruses have always overlapped, this time it could be futile due to the large number of asymptomatic positives, felt Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra. “The speed and pattern of transmission suggests that most are asymptomatic, so merely testing those with symptoms will not check the spread. But the brighter side of this sudden explosion in numbers is that the disease has been mild and it will help hasten herd immunity,” said Mitra. There’s very little to distinguish between Covid and other viruses, said internal medicine consultant Arindam Biswas. “In fact, many Covid positives now have milder symptoms than those suffering from upper respiratory infections caused by other viruses. So a test is recommended but a large number of patients with mild symptoms are bound to slip through the net,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/symptoms-overlap-with-common-colds-prompt-call-for-caution/articleshow/88743920.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Doctors return to wards after isolation norm tweak, help hospitals tide over staff crunch||KOLKATA: Private hospitals across the city, which have seen scores of their doctors, nurses and health workers test Covid positive over the last five days, heaved a sigh of relief and greeted the altered isolation norm that now allows the infected to come out of quarantine in seven days.  A few hundred of their doctors and nurses, who are now in isolation, will return to work next week, allowing the hospitals to maintain their work schedule and keep serving Covid patients. Around 150 health workers of RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) are now in isolation. They include around 25 doctors. The change in the guidelines will help in providing a seamless and continued treatment to patients, said zonal head R Venkatesh. “Even if we are able to get half of the infected healthcare workers back in time, it will go a long way in helping to serve the patients well. As per the timeline, we expect 50% of them to join work by next Monday. A few of them have expressed their inability to join back in seven days as they are still a bit febrile and have weakness,” said Venkatesh. Thirty-five health workers, including several doctors, have tested positive at Peerless Hospital and are now in quarantine. “The curtailed isolation period will help us get them back next week. Since all of them tested positive earlier this week, they should return by the middle of next week. On the flip side, many more could get infected over the next few days. But the shorter isolation will prevent a major depletion in workforce,” said Peerless CEO Sudipta Mitra. On Thursday, a doctor at Medica Superspecialty Hospital, where 60-70 health workers are affected, returned to work after a seven-day isolation. “We have around 14 doctors in isolation now and they should return by next week. This will help to keep our services unaffected,” said chairperson Alok Roy. Government hospitals, too, will benefit from the new guideline or else their services would have collapsed, said Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education & Research (IPGMER) professor Diptendra Sarkar. “Around 15 doctors at the surgery department of SSKM are now in isolation. This will allow them to return to work next week. Without them, the surgery department would have faced a shutdown,” said Sarkar, himself in isolation now. With doctors testing positive to Covid at an alarming frequency, some private hospitals in the city have advised their medics to carry on serving at Covid units with all precaution even if they have the virus but remain asymptomatic. While the ‘advise’ has been given strictly at an unofficial level and doctors have been asked to use their discretion, the hospitals say their Covid units will soon collapse if those on duty have to isolate themselves on testing positive. A senior medic, who has been at the frontline of Covid treatment at a south Kolkata private hospital, has refused to get tested even after he developed mild symptoms earlier this week. He has been using PPE and continues to work at the Covid unit. “My symptoms are mild and I am still fit enough to work. I am likely to be positive if I get tested but if I do, I will have to isolate myself. That will land all my Covid patients in trouble since several of my colleagues are already in isolation after testing positive,” said the doctor. Some hospitals, however, pointed out that while the home isolation period has been reduced to seven days, it won’t help those who get admitted to hospital. “Even if they recover in two-three days, their isolation period will begin from the day of discharge and hence they will be serving a longer quarantine,” said general manager (operations) of Ruby General Hospital Subhashish Datta. Twenty-five health workers, including five doctors of Ruby, are now in isolation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/docs-return-to-wards-after-isolation-norm-tweak-help-hospitals-tide-over-staff-crunch/articleshow/88743921.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Kolkata||Met office spies rain in Kolkata next week||KOLKATA: The city may receive light to moderate rain next week under the impact of a western disturbance (WD), which is now brewing in northwest India. As it leads to a “system” in Rajasthan, the chilly northwesterly winds will disappear and warm easterly winds will start flowing in from the sea, pulling the mercury up. The minimum temperature may crawl up to 16 degrees by this weekend, said the Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC). Kolkata recorded a minimum temperature of 13 degrees on Thursday. “We expect rain in Kolkata and its neighbourhood between January 12 and 15 as the WD blocks the northwesterly. The latter may come to a complete halt within the next 24 hours. It will immediately be replaced by easterly winds that will bring in warmth. As a result, the mercury will rise by a degree every day, eventually touching 16 degrees by the end of the week,” said RMC director GK Das. Even though the temperature will rise from Friday, the WD will not lead to clouds and the city will remain sunny, said the Met officials. “We don’t expect clouds before next week,” said Das.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/met-office-spies-rain-in-city-next-week/articleshow/88743922.cms||---

The estimated cost of the project is Rs 12.2 crore. Officials said that cycle racing events would be organised in the velodrome. The officials are also planning to develop facilities for skating in the central open area of the velodrome and an open green field in the middle around the circular oval shaped cycle with a few tiers platform, where spectators can sit. Earlier, Hidco had engaged a consultant to chalk out a plan for the proposed project, which is touted to be the first-of-its-kind in the state. The agency that will be selected to construct the velodrome will have to complete the project within 12 months from the date of the commencement of work. Last year, New Town was declared as one of the 11 stage-1 winner cities of the Cycle4 Change Challenge that was launched by the ministry of housing and urban affairs in July, 2020 for its commitment towards developing sustainable green transport and extensive cycling ecosystem. Hidco and NKDA have been working to develop cycle infrastructure in New Town with a 20km of dedicated cycle lane having already been demarcated. More cycle lanes have been proposed in the township where several cycling events and competitions are being held. The 100 app-based public cycle sharing scheme is also operating in the township with more e-cycles to be introduced. Besides, the authorities are also planning to set up another smart art gallery in the township at the ground floor of the utility building opposite City Centre II mall.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/250-metre-velodrome-on-cards-in-new-town-for-cycling-events/articleshow/88743923.cms||Suman Chakraborti

Police gave its nod to the shutdown on Thursday in view of the reduced traffic volume in the wake of the Covid surge. With the flyover barricaded for the test, both north and south-bound vehicles will avail JL Nehru Road. Lalbazar said they will post extra personnel around the Park Street crossing if required. “We might face a little burden during office hours on Saturday and Monday morning. But there should not be any issue as traffic volume has declined,” said an officer. HRBC has been asked to complete work before Tuesday peak hour traffic. In case of any emergency, a part of the Esplanade-bound traffic will be diverted through Red Road from Park Street crossing. Similarly, the Exide-bound traffic will be diverted through Dufferin Road and Mayo Road via RR Avenue.

The cost of the overall maintenance work has been pegged at nearly Rs 2 crore. The officials said that in the past, there had been several complaints about the lights of the flyover not working properly. “One of the agencies that will be roped in for the maintenance will have to ensure that all the lights function,” said an official. “It was noticed after rain last year that water accumulated in some parts of the flyover’s carriageway due to the clogged rainwater pipes. These pipes will be repaired and replaced if necessary before the next monsoon,” said the official.

Chief minister Mamata Banerjee will also be present at the inauguration, which will be held virtually. The campus was built at a cost of Rs 530 crore. The Centre has provided Rs 400 crore while the rest of the expenditure was given by the state government in a 75:25 ratio. It will work as an advanced cancer research centre and will cater to patients from east and north-east India. An autonomous body under the Centre, CNCI is the only government-run cancer hospital in Bengal so far. Started in 1950, the existing CNCI facility in Hazra has been under tremendous pressure due to the increasing load of patients. An expansion plan for a new campus in Tollygunge, which had been drawn up in 2005, had to be scrapped due to the unavailability of adequate land. The proposal for the Rajarhat unit was made in 2008. The pandemic has delayed the inauguration of the new campus spread over 10 acre of land.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/pm-to-unveil-new-cnci-campus-today/articleshow/88743927.cms||---
---||Kolkata||BMC contestants turn to digital canvassing, calls to dodge C-spread||Kolkata: Candidates contesting for the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC) polls on January 22 are opting for digital canvassing, distribution of leaflets in neighbourhoods and “miking” on autos to avoid gatherings at usual meetings and rallies. From only 20 to 25 daily Covid cases in the civic area even in the last week of December, the figure has gone up to over 300. Several BMC officials and cops from the Bidhannagar commissionarate have been infected, too. Fourteen micro-containment zones have been earmarked in the BMC area, 10 of them in Salt Lake alone. Of those, two new in Salt Lake were added on Thursday. Campaigning for their candidates contesting for councillors’ posts, party workers have been circulating messages through WhatsApp and posting on Facebook. Outgoing mayor Krishna Chakraborty said she did visit neighbourhoods in her Ward 29 with a few party supporters but did not enter any home. “I am seeking people’s blessings from outside their houses, keeping distance. I am focusing on campaigning through social media platforms,” she said. Former mayor Sabyasachi Dutta, too, seemed to adopt a similar campaign mode, walking through the blocks in Ward 31 with a few party workers and seeking votes from outside houses. Dutta himself was seen distributing masks to people not wearing them. A “miking” campaigning is also on across Salt Lake, with party workers making the rounds in autos and urging residents to vote for Dutta.  Former BMC MMiC and four-time councillor Devasish Jana, contesting on a BJP ticket from Ward 31, said he had been meeting people outside their homes, but his focus was on personal communication through phone. Trinamool four-time councillor Tulshi Sinha Roy has also been mainatining safe distance and avoiding anything that could lead to crowding. “I will visit neighbourhoods with only a few party workers and follow all safety norms. I am stressing more on personal contact. I keep contact with people round the year,” said Sinha Roy, contesting from Ward 40. Trinamool candidates have also gone all out with graffiti, especially in Duttabad, Mahisbathan and other places adjacent to Salt Lake. In Salt Lake, parties are depending on hoardings and festoons.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/bmc-contestants-turn-to-digital-canvassing-calls-to-dodge-c-spread/articleshow/88743928.cms||---

He also wanted proper checks at markets so that entry is controlled to closed premises. He also wanted to monitor hospitalization process, as there are apprehensions that there might be bed crisis. He asked officers to give thrust on vaccination so that those with the first dose can have the inoculation completed.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata Municipal Corporation ready for the rush, keeps 330 beds at three safe homes||KOLKATA: The unprecedented spike in the number of Covid cases led KMC to reopen its safe homes but few seem willing to isolate themselves there. Given the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus this time, the civic body on January 2 decided to reopen three homes so that Covid-positive people, who might not have proper isolation facilities, could quarantine there for seven days. But so far, fewer than two dozen patients have been accommodated to the homes that can accommodate 330 people. The first of the homes has been opened at Geetanjali Stadium, meant to cater to residents of south and southeast Kolkata. The second one is at a commercial building located near Science City, where Covid-affected people living in slums in the large parts of Tiljala, Topsia and Dhapa-Mathpukur belt can put up. While those two safe homes had been up and running, the third one on Harekrshna Seth Lane in Cossipore still needed some of the infrastructure to be installed, said a KMC health department official. According to deputy mayor Atin Ghosh, the number of Covid-positive patients at the KMC-run safe homes stood at 20 on Wednesday. A KMC health department official pointed out while the capacity of the Geetanjali Stadium was 100, that of the safe homes near Science City and on Harekrishna Seth Lane were 150 and 80 respectively. Explaining the reasons for the low occupancy, a KMC health department official said people who were testing positive in large numbers were either asymptomatic or showing very mild symptoms. “Amid such a situation, they aren’t willing to move out of their houses and take shelter in safe homes. The 20 patients so far admitted, all are stable. None has required oxygen till now,” said a civic official. Also, with all members in most families testing positive, many did not feel the need to isolate, another official pointed out. There are some lapses on the part of the civic authorities for people not availing of the facilitiy, said a KMC health department official. “Last time, we had advertised about our safe houses well in advance and shared special helplines in every borough. We then built a team of doctors, paramedical staff and security officers before patients had started coming in. This time, we are not as ready as we were last year when we decided to open safe houses. Several of our medical officers, nurses and paramedical staffers are down with fever. We need some more time to give full-fledged services at the safe houses,” a KMC health department official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/kmc-ready-for-the-rush-keeps-330-beds-at-three-safe-homes/articleshow/88743930.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Kolkata||‘Continue prosecutions but reduce close contact’||Kolkata: Police commissioner Vineet Goyal has asked traffic police to reduce direct interaction with motorists, make use of automatic signal systems, discontinue seizure cases and focus on citations and ensure they wear masks and face shields while on duty to take guard against Covid. However, breathalyzer tests and prosecutions will continue. The cops also stepped up mask and Covid prosecutions on a day CM Mamata Banerjee asked police to enforce the mask rule stringently. On Thursday, 245 were prosecuted for not wearing face masks. In other Covid violations, 829 persons were arrested, while 856 were prosecuted for violating the night curbs. “We have prosecuted 1,319 persons for various Covid related violations between Wednesday midnight and Thursday noon,” said an officer last Lalbazar.The development came at a time when a total of 183 Kolkata Police cops have been detected with Covid in the third wave, with as many as 52 cops being found to be Covid positive on Thursday alone. “There is a rumour that we are stopping prosecutions. We have not taken any such decision. The only advice from the top is to avoid direct seizures of documents. Citation and sticker cases shall continue as before. But we are very serious about drink driving prosecutions. Tests shall continue and so shall seizures in connection with the same,” said a senior police officer.Traffic personnel have also been asked to use gloves and face shields in addition to masks while interacting with the public on roads. “This was enforced during both the first and second waves and is just a reiteration of the old order as the importance given to sanitizing the police stations and traffic guards,” added the officer. With traffic volume seeing a steady decline ever since 45,000-plus new cases reported in the state in the past one week, traffic cops are also mulling going back to automatic signalling and instead use the extra manpower in carrying out citation challans. “We have hardly seen any congestion since Monday. We need our personnel to stay fit while at the same time taking people into account if they violate Covid and traffic norms,” said police.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/continue-prosecutions-but-reduce-close-contact/articleshow/88743931.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Among the addresses that have multiple Covid cases and have been identified for containment measures include 24 large housing complexes across Ballygunge, Shakespeare Sarani, Tollygunge, Bhowanipore, Gariahat, Anandapur, Behala and Sarsuna. Four hostels of IIM-Calcutta Joka are located on the southern fringes of the city. “The stats may show that large parts of south Kolkata are under containment zones but that doesn’t actually mean that people here are more reckless than residents in other parts of the city. Since the city’s expansion, large parts of Behala, Joka, Jadavpur and Garden Reach have been included in the KMC area increasing its number from 100 to 144. But there has been no such inclusion in the northern or central parts,” said a senior KMC official. The number of micro containment zones in Kolkata that had almost doubled in a day on Wednesday remained 48 on Thursday following the inclusion of 23 new addresses on Wednesday. While there are hardly four slums in Phoolbagan and Kasba, there are as many as 32 complexes and multi-storeyed residential buildings, out of which 24 are in South Kolkata, five in north and three in central Kolkata. Apart from those like Silver Spring, Urbana, Active Acres and Swarnamani, that were already on the list, multiple other complexes like a tower at Diamond City West in Behala Sarsuna, Blossoms County in Behala Buroshibtala, Maples Apartments in Maniktala and Rukmani Parasmani Apartments in Narkeldanga were included in Wednesday’s list. “Number of cases in our complex is rising at a rapid pace,” said Deepak Agarwal, member of residents’ welfare committee at Diamond City West, which was included in the list on Wednesday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/over-70-of-citys-micro-c-zones-in-south-kol/articleshow/88743932.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

Against the average 4-lakh commuter count last week, the North-South corridor is carrying nearly 1.5 lakh less people these days. On Wednesday, it clocked 2,34,811 footfall and on Tuesday, 2,40,949. On Monday, 2,17,858 people took the Metro as only smartcard holders are allowed to travel. Since Monday, Metro has withdrawn the token system, reduced weekday operation hours from 9.30pm to 9pm along the Kavi Subhas-Dakshineswar stretch, which is Kolkata’s transport lifeline. Consequently, there’s a 2-lakh ridership fall this week, in sharp contrast to Christmas Eve, when Metro breached the 4.5-lakh mark, four days after the utility attained the 4-lakh mark. Ridership fell on Friday even as Covid cases rose. On New Year’s Eve, Metro carried 3,64,539 with 276 services, much less than the Christmas Day passenger count of 4,33,619 with just 230 services. Protyush Ghosh, DGM, Metro Railway, said, “We withdrew tokens precisely because we wanted less people to ride the Metro, in keeping with the state government’s 50% ridership cap, adding, “We shall continue like this until the government revises guidelines.” Metro is currently running 270 trains from Monday to Friday instead of 276, following the state government’s Covid-induced restrictions that only allows it to ferry 50 % of its usual daily ridership.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/metro-commuter-count-dips-by-1-5l-in-a-week-after-token-withdrawal/articleshow/88743933.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

---||Kolkata||Cov’s market distortion: Fewer buyers, low demand, high prices of winter veggies||Kolkata: A large number of people seem to have decided to temporarily avoid visiting markets, among other usually crowded places, fearing contracting the novel coronavirus.  Given the sudden dip in the number of customers, vegetable vendors have been forced to throw away unsold perishable items, incurring a substantial loss. That, in turn, has been preventing the prices to come down. Buyers were literally caught in the vicious cycle of Covid, where low demand prevented drop in prices of commodities, said Gouranga Kar, an economist.Vendors said their usual customers were visiting only when absolutely necessary. “They have become minimalists, buying rice, potatoes and the bare minimum, essential vegetables and quickly going back home. There is no mood for leisurely buying. There is hardly any buyer. After having to dump a large amount of vegetables, now, we are picking up very small amounts to minimise the loss,” said Subal Saha, a vegetable trader at Lake Market.Wholesale prices had dropped, but they did not reflect in retail prices, said Kamal De, president West Bengal Vendors’ Association. This is because most retailers have not been able to bring down vegetable prices, which usually plunge in winter, to make up for the loss. As a result, the gap between retail and wholesale prices has been widening. Winter vegetable prices have been hovering around Rs 40 a kg, which should have dropped to less than Rs 20 a kg by now. Last winter, the prices of vegetables had dropped below Rs 20 a kg. The non-winter vegetables have been selling for pver Rs 150 a kg. “Brinjal is going for Rs 60 a kg, bitter gourd also Rs 60 a kg, green chillies Rs100 a kg and tomatoes Rs 50 a kg. It does not seem like winter. The high prices of winter vegetables have robbed the fun of cooking delicacies in the cold weather. There is a chill in the air, but vegetables prices remain hot,” said Ritabhori Dutta, a homemaker at Parnashree. Dilip Mondal, a trader at Gariahat market, said, “The third wave of the pandemic is sweeping through the city and 75% customers cannot be seen in the markets. People are too scared to come out of their homes as their experience with the second onslaught is still fresh in their memory. If the demand rises, the supply will also be robust and prices will fall.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/covs-market-distortion-fewer-buyers-low-demand-high-prices-of-winter-veggies/articleshow/88743935.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

Following a complaint, the three employees were arrested on Wednesday by Beltarodi police, who have so far been able to recover only one pup’s body. Mayur Nagrale, owner of an eatery near Panjra Toll Naka on Wardha Road, approached Beltarodi police station on Wednesday with a complaint against the owner and employees of the adjacent dhaba. Nagrale claimed that his complaint was based on CCTV footage of his premises, where people are seen thrashing a puppy and lifting it’s body before hurling it over the periphery wall. Three employees, Munna Sharma, Swapnil Uikey and Ulhas Wankhede, of the dhaba adjacent to that of Nagrale’s premises were arrested for their alleged role in killing the puppies. Nagrale, a dog lover, said the three employees had sneaked into his premises twice. In the early morning, they killed two puppies, whose bodies could not be recovered. Later in the evening, they killed another puppy, which was witnessed by someone from his eatery. Nagrale said after scrutinizing the CCTV on Wednesday he approached the cops. “Initially, the FIR was not lodged. The cops booked the servants, who will not act without instructions from their employers,” he said. There was also a dispute between Nagrale’s employees and those of the adjacent dhaba when they went to confront them over killing the puppies. Nagrale’s employees were also bitten by the pet dogs of the adjacent dhaba during the scuffle. Activist Smita Mire, who helped file the FIR, said Zonal DCPs Vinita S and Noorul Hasan helped to take prompt action. “We have also asked cops to invoke the Cruelty to Animals Act,” she said. Senior PI Chandrashekhar Yadav of Beltarodi police station said all appropriate legal actions would be initiated in the case.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/three-puppies-bludgeoned-to-death-for-chasing-ducks/articleshow/88742729.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Mangaluru||Now DK has more active cases than Kasaragod||Mangaluru: After more than a year, the number of active Covid-19 cases in Dakshina Kannada (DK) crossed the tally of the border district of Kasaragod in Kerala. Dakshina Kannada district’s active cases had reduced to less than 100 in the third week of November last year, when there were nearly 800 active cases in Kasaragod. As on Wednesday, the number of active cases in DK increased to 441, while the number reduced to 352 in Kasaragod. The Dakshina Kannada district administration has increased its surveillance measures throughout the district, especially on the Kerala-Karnataka border, to reduce the number of daily cases. DHO Dr Kishore Kumar M told TOI that inter-state commuters from Kerala cannot be blamed at this juncture, when cases are seen everywhere. “We have been witnessing a spike in cases across the district, not only among students from Kerala. In addition to students, cases are being reported among the public too in the district. Though we have been witnessing a spike in cases, the death rate is the lowest, and those tested do not have severe symptoms. Other than slight headache and cold, the majority of those tested do not show any symptoms. Our test positivity rate (TPR) was less than 1% till recently, even when the TPR was above 10% in Kerala. However, the situation is different now. We have also witnessed an increase in cases, when the tally goes up in Maharashtra. People from Dakshina Kannada settled in Maharashtra visit during the year end for festivals, and that also could be a reason for the spread of the virus here,” the DHO said. “The district has been continuing with surveillance measures at all places, even on the inter-state border. The health department is now working to contain the spread of the virus further,” he added. Dr Ashok H, nodal officer for Covid-19 in Dakshina Kannada, said that the number of cases is increasing across the district, as predicted earlier. “The number of daily cases in Dakshina Kannada is increasing every day, despite all measures being in place. We have directed educational institutions in the district to follow the guidelines strictly. We have been conducting an average of 11,000 tests per day in the district,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/now-dk-has-more-active-cases-than-kasaragod/articleshow/88741299.cms||---

Besides this, the neighbouring state has resumed work on a similar project over the Colval river in Sasoli-Maneri villages in its Dodamarg taluka where presently pipeline laying is underway. The Maharashtra state government had unilaterally undertaken the work of constructing an anicut and a jackwell over the Colvale river in 2014. Work on this project, which was aimed at providing 23.8 MLD water to 17 villages and 88.4 MLD raw water to the industrial estate at Adali, was stopped following objection by then Goa chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar. The Khadshi is one of many perennial nallas that emerge from the Western Ghats forest in Padve-Majgao and enters Goa at Mopa in Pernem and eventually joins the Tiracol river at Uguem. Agriculturalists and horticulturalists of Dongarpal, Dingane, Morgao and Netarde in Maharashtra and Mopa, Tamboxe and Uguem in Pernem obtain irrigation water from the Khadshi nullah. Horticulturist Prakash Valavalkar from Morgaon in Dodamarg told TOI that this project will severely affect the natural flow of the Khadshi nalla and threaten their irrigation water supply. Presently, following intervention by Maharashtra minister Uday Samant, work at Adali has been stopped till further directives are received from higher authorities. Villagers from Mopa and the vicinity have urged the Goa government to take immediate steps to restrain Maharashtra from diverting water from the Khadashi nullah. “I will ask our officials to visit the area and submit the fact finding report immediately,” WRD chief engineer Pramod Badami told TOI.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/now-maharashtra-building-anicut-over-khadshi-nullah/articleshow/88736365.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar

They must be identified and police must find oput how they managed to reach the place, he said.“The PM’s security, whether Narendra Modi or any other Prime Minister, is extremely important. If the PM’s security is compromised, then the country’s reputation suffers internationally,” Kamal Nath said.“We have to find the reasons for this lapse. Finally, it is always the SPG that decides PM security. Which route was changed, how much time was taken for the route change and whether adequate preparations can be made with such change in route —- all this had to be decided by the SPG,” he said. Speaking to reporters here, the PCC chief said that there are videos on social media of some people raising slogans of ‘Pradhan Mantri Zindabad’. “Who are they? How did they reach that spot when no leader can reach the Prime Minister without prior appointment?” he asked.Nath said that a probe is being conducted by the home ministry and the state government and it will bring everything to light.Reacting to CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s allegations holding Congress responsible for the security lapse, Nath said, “Shivraj Singh Chouhan has nothing much to say. If it is 18 degrees Celsius temperature today, he will say it is because of Congress. If temperature becomes 10 degrees, then also he will say Congress is responsible for it. He believes that nothing can be wrong when it is Shivraj Singh Chouhan and the BJP.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/nath-questions-the-way-spg-changed-pms-route/articleshow/88743965.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: Omicron must not be taken lightly, warn doctors||BHOPAL: During the last two days, ICU admissions across Madhya Pradesh has increased fourfold. 1.8 times more patients with Covid-19 have been put on oxygen support in two days, going by health department data. Reserved isolation beds demand has also increase fivefold in two days. Medical experts are warning people over being complacent about Omicron wave of Covid-19 infections being less severe. For the uninitiated here is something to consider. “Most of the cases being diagnosed not ascertained to be Omicron. Delta variant is still prevalent. There is a perception that Omicron cases are milder and spread faster and it will become the dominant variant. Evidence for the same is awaited. Covid-19 infection in itself is a concern for which vaccination and Covid-19 appropriate behaviour is needed from all of us to get over the pandemic,” said Gandhi Medical College (GMC) HoD medicine and leading pulmonologist, Dr Lokendra Dave. “There is data wherein Omicron variant is known to be highly contagious. There situation gets worrisome when a surge takes place within days instead of weeks, the healthcare system will be challenged. Also a rise in hospitalization among unvaccinated children is not a situation anyone wants,” said Dr Rajiv Singh. Current situation has heightened anxiety among parents. Between November 30 and December 22 – 22-days, the number of patients with Covid-19 and requiring intensive care treatment increased by one. In the last two days, the number increased from 31 to 65. “It took almost three months for Delta variant to hit 1000 cases in MP (December 26, 2020 to March 17, 2021). Omicron was reported as variant of concern on November 26, 2021. First case was reported from Indore a month later. Ten days ago, on December 27, 2021 MP reported 30 new cases of Covid-19. Today the figure was above 1,000 cases in a single day. Omicron cannot be taken lightly,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/omicron-must-not-be-taken-lightly-warn-docs/articleshow/88743966.cms||---

The 2021 situation is again in front of the students in 2022 as students worry whether their final exams would be online or offline. Notably, last year, board exams were cancelled and students were declared on the basis of the internal assessment. Students said that the ongoing situation is scaring them. “I am not comfortable with online academics. Whether it is an academic class or an exam there should be offline classes. However, the present situation persists for a long time. There may be a situation where we have to appear for online exams again,” said a student Prateek Verma. Students also felt that exams should be offline. “Last year I had to suffer a lot during online exams. During last year’s online exams, I had to face several challenges. I do not want to see the same situation again. I am afraid the same situation may appear again if the cases continue to rise,” said Sarthak Shukla, a student. Even teachers are also worried. “After the second wave ended, we were trying to boost up the confidence of the students about attending offline classes. Even several students had started attending offline classes. However, the Omicron has disturbed the situation again and such is the situation that students do not want to come to the school at any cost,” said a teacher, Swati Sharma. Teachers also felt that students in the absence of offline classes may lose several important academics which were just possible in offline classes only. “For the past two years, students have been suffering a lot. This is not a good situation for school-going students,” said teacher Mukesh Rai.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/students-worried-about-exams-amid-surge/articleshow/88743967.cms||Ramendra Singh

---||Bhopal||Bhopal stays unmasked & unfazed||BHOPAL: Despite regular instructions and even an increase in the monetary fines for not wearing masks, there are still people roaming around who bluntly refuse to wear them. TOI took a stock of different places across the state capital and found that several people in both government offices and private entities are not wearing masks. Mantralaya This is one of the busiest places in the state capital. Both government employees and other citizens could be seen visiting here in large numbers. Even at this place several people were seen without masks. When asked about it, people tried to move out or find their masks. A man showing his mask said, “I have a mask. I was wearing it. As I have to discuss some important things with an official, I removed it. It was tough to interact with the people while having the mask on my face so I removed it. I can wear it again,” said the person who refused to tell his name. There were other people with masks on their faces, but it was no more than a formality. “You can see that most of the people were wearing masks but several of them have put it on their neck instead of their faces. This is not done. By doing this, the safety of others is also compromised. MPT Palash ResidencyHotel is a place where the movement of people is always high. Shockingly, the employees at the Palash Residency did not bother about it. While visiting the reception it was found that the employees were interacting with the guests without wearing masks. A guest at the hotel told TOI that if these employees of a government hotel won’t follow the masks, then how others could be motivated. “I have been coming to this hotel frequently in the past also for lunch and other family functions. However, I have noticed that the receptionist at the hotel never bothers to wear mask. This is highly objectionable,” said a guest without quoting his name. Another guest added, “I wish to know how many government employees have been fined by the district administration for not wearing the mask. Are the rules for the common man only.” Notably, the district administration has increased the fine from Rs 100 to Rs 200. District courtThe situation outside the district court is even worse. Here, social distancing was completely missing. Several visitors were spotted without masks. When asked, a visitor reacted, “Why are you after common man? Go and see how many officers and elite people are wearing the masks. I have come to court for important work. Don’t disturb me,” he reacted. Even the private vendors situated outside the court were not wearing masks. “Look at these vendors. I have never seen them wearing masks. The rising number of Covid cases is because of such situations which are available all across society. This needs to be addressed. New MarketThis is the place in Bhopal which has become vulnerable for every visitor. “Number of masks on the faces of the people have increased compared to the past. However, there are still several shopkeepers in the market who hardly bothers about it,” said Jai Prakash, a retired government employee. He added that there should be a regular campaign by the district administration to fine such people who are not wearing the masks. “Look at the crowd. I am scared to move inside New Market after seeing such a crowd. People should understand that precaution is better than cure and in this case mask and vaccination is the only available cure,” said Akash Lal, a visitor to the New Market.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/despite-the-surge-mask-mandate-not-being-followed/articleshow/88743973.cms||---

Police and Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC) staff were seen checking for masks on the roads on Wednesday. From Trilanga to Ret Ghat, police parties accompanied by BMC staff were seen stopping people for not wearing masks near 7 no. stop, Polytechnic square and Retghat square even as persons without masks and helmets particularly two-wheeler riders turned their vehicle back on sighting the police and taking other routes but some of them, who failed to do it, were caught by the police and fined but it was not so on Thursday.Maybe, the teams formed to enforce compulsory mask norms were doing it more subtly in market areas or other crowded public places and not on the roads. Collector Avinash Lavania had said on Wednesday that several teams comprising a revenue inspector, a BMC and police personnel have been formed for checking masks and making an on-the-spot fine. Spokesperson for the district administration Arun Rathore, however, said there is no change of strategy. “You may not have seen the checking taking place on roads on Thursday but we have limited staff and they are deployed at different places on different days. Checking is also taking place at crowded public places.” However, a vendor at 7 no. stop market on the first day of checking had observed that police should be a little innovative in the way it carries out its checking campaign. “The police pickets at this spot are permanent. If checking gets underway, you know where you can find the police. At this point near 7 no. stop market, near Nutam college, near Apex Bank in the New Market, Polytechnic square and at times at 10 No. market. Accordingly people change their route .” Maybe realising this, the administration changed its strategy on Thursday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/authorities-get-cracking-on-mask-mandate-mobile-teams-keep-watch/articleshow/88743974.cms||---

Moving away to outdoors, Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC) top officials were present at an Swachh Bharat mission linked event at New Market on Wednesday. Under the Swachh Bhopal competition participants took part in street play and other musical categories.

An amount of Rs 8,000 crore will be spent on these projects. Under the "Pradhan Mantri Gatishakti Yojana", information about all the projects built, under construction and proposed in the next one year will be compiled on the GIS platform. Efforts are being made for full utilisation of Narmada water by 2024. Chouhan said that development of irrigation facilities has been a major factor in increasing the production of various foodgrains in the state. “Irrigation area is continuously increasing in the state. Maximum irrigation of land is our top priority. In order to provide maximum benefit of irrigation facilities to farmers, it is necessary that the works of the irrigation projects should be completed within the time frame. Officers should undertake field visits. Give results by setting goals and tasks for each month”, he said. Chouhan said that farmers' participation in irrigation management should be encouraged. If people's participation in water management of farmers increases, then necessary works related to maintenance of schemes will also be completed on time.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/complete-irrigation-projects-on-time-cm-tells-officials/articleshow/88743978.cms||---

The PTR acquired a new night vision (thermal and IR) drone in its squad in the last week of December. The device will help boost security of the reserve, known for its successful tiger relocation programme after all its tigers had vanished in 2008. In August last year , a ‘drone squad’ was constituted for protection, monitoring and management of wildlife in the tiger reserve. The squad consists of a ‘DJ1 Phantom drone with sufficient batteries to operate for long hours, a dedicated vehicle and a drone operator with an assistant, park sources said. “ Monthly schedule has been chalked out for the functioning and use of the machine by the drone squad”, they said. Park director Uttam Kumar Sharma said that the use of drone in PTR has been envisaged for law enforcement, monitoring, search and rescue of wildlife, wildfires firefighting and curbing human-animal conflict. Future use of drone has been planned for ecotourism, monitoring invasive plant species, recreational and educational purposes and documentation of the bio-diversity.” The night device drone is another step to ensure 24-hour vigil in sensitive areas of the park, park director said, adding that more drones may be added for better wildlife management of the park.

---||Nagpur||In 2021, Gadchiroli police seized firearms Maoists looted in 2002-03||Nagpur: Gadchiroli police, which seized 57 firearms from Maoists in 2021, have managed to recover weapons that the rebels looted from security forces as early as 2002-03 in Chhattisgarh. The cops are now tracing the origin of each weapon seized from Maoists. District police are now focusing on charting the source of each firearm seized to ascertain from where they were looted by the rebels after killing security personnel. The exercise is being undertaken to ascertain the role of Maoists in targeting security personnel to rob their weapons and use them to launch assaults on the state forces. A senior official said the findings of the weapon-tracing exercise has underlined that Maoists had been using firearms robbed after killing security forces. “It’s learnt that Maoists have a centralized system of pooling the weapons robbed from security personnel and then distributing them across their cadres,” said the official. The official added, “We are sending the details of seized firearms to different states and agencies, seeking information like when and where they were robbed, and after killing how many security personnel in such encounters.” He said police are also seeking technical assistance from ballistic experts and completing legal procedures to return the firearms to the states and units from where they were robbed. Gadchiroli police also recovered 49 bodies of Maoist rebels from 16 encounters in 2021, which means around three rebels were neutralized per action, setting a record for the last three decades of Maoist violence in the state. Though the number of arrests were lowest (14) since 2009, several top leaders surrendered before the police last year. “We arrested one injured Maoist who had sustained bullet injuries during an encounter last year. He was provided medical attention and taken into custody only after completing the treatment,” said police superintendent (SP) Ankit Goyal, adding that police’s civic action under the umbrella project of ‘Dadalora khidki’ benefited more than one lakh Gadchiroli citizens in 2021 through skill development training, employment generation and other support. The SP said every encounter was analyzed, the faults identified and rectified through expert intervention. “The insights gleaned from each encounter were made the basis for future strategy improvement,” said Goyal. Though more bodies (50) were recovered in 2018, the success then could materialize only after 34 encounters, which are more than double that in 2021. The highest number of arrests (167) had taken place in 2009 when police had suffered 51 casualties (the most in a year) against Maoists.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/in-2021-gadchiroli-police-seized-firearms-maoists-looted-in-2002-03/articleshow/88742737.cms||Soumitra Bose

Left with no option, ASHA workers and women of the village who accompanied Vani held up umbrellas, spread blankets on the wet earth and lit torches to conduct the delivery. Fortunately, the delivery was successful and both Vani and her newborn are fine. While villagers are happy with the birth of a healthy child, they say that the incident has yet again exposed their vulnerability in absence of roads. Talking to TOI, they said people have been demanding the construction of a road in the village for as long as they can remember but in vain. “The mother and the child could have died. They couldn’t be taken to the hospital on time as there was no road. After delivery, they had to be brought back home in a palanquin. The authorities are ignorant of our cries,” said Prem Singh Bisht, gram pradhan, Patalchaura village. He added that an inspection for the construction of a road was conducted in the village some time back but the work hasn’t started yet. “Are the authorities awaiting a casualty to start the road construction work,” asked Bisht. When queried on the issue, GB Joshi, assistant engineer, public works department, told TOI, “We have already conducted a survey for road construction in the village and ground work in this regard would start soon.” Taking cognisance of the episode, Jyoti Sah Mishra, deputy chief, Uttarakhand Commission for Women, has directed Almora district authorities to identify villages where there are expectant mothers but lack road connectivity.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/lack-of-road-rain-force-woman-in-almora-village-to-deliver-baby-in-a-field-under-torch-light/articleshow/88741319.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: This Covid-19 surge four times faster, caution advised for kids||LUCKNOW: What makes adherence to Covid-19 prevention protocol even more essential in the current surge is the fact that the cases are increasing a much faster pace than the second wave even though the rate of hospitalisation is almost half of what it was during the delta surge. Assessment of data undertaken by the state health department — comparing the second wave (March 3 to June 30, 2021) with the current surge (December 1, 2021 to January 3, 2022) — indicated that the present surge is almost four times faster. Data showed that it took 23 days for the cases to increase from about 100 and cross the 1,000 mark. But in the present surge, the jump from 100 to 1,000 came in a matter of seven days. Also, the surge in RT-PCR positivity rate from 0.1 to 1.8 during the second wave took almost 28 days, which is now happening in almost six days. Lower hospitalisation The analysis also showed that the rate of hospitalisation due to the pandemic prevalent now is almost half of what it was at the time of the second wave. Health department data showed that on an overall scale, the rate of hospitalisation during second wave was 9%, which is about 5.5% in the present surge. But considering the pace of growth, medical models indicate that the numbers of patients may be much higher in the present surge than the second wave. Therefore, the risk of overwhelming the health system cannot be ruled out. State surveillance officer, Dr Vikasendu Agarwal said that while admissions in October, November and December remained in single digits, it has increased to 125 in just six days. Of these, two are in the intensive care unit and eight are on oxygen support. Risk same to those with comorbidities Comparative data indicated that the rate of hospitalisation at the tertiary care level remains the same, 1.8%. Experts are of the view that those with any comorbid condition must try their best not to contract the infection by adhering to the prevention protocol, wearing masks, limiting unnecessary venturing out and getting vaccinated. “This means that the elderly, especially with one or more comorbid conditions particularly diabetes, cardiovascular disease or history of lung disease, need to limit movement to crowded places, follow their medication regime and monitory their key parameters as prescribed,” suggested Dr Abhishek Shukla, geriatric health specialist and secretary general, Association of International Doctors. Higher positivity rate in 11-19 age group The data also showed a higher RT-PCR positivity rate in elder children and adolescents (11-19 years age-group) were at a higher risk of contracting the infection, which also calls for additional precautions for this age group. Experts are of the view that wards of children below 14 years of age must stay cautious. “Children must be encouraged to wash hands frequently especially when they return home, keep their nasal passage clean (use of steam in elder children and use of lukewarm water in smaller ones), imposing restrictions to curb development of influenza like illnesses etc,” said Dr Sanjay Niranjan, senior functionary at the Indian Paediatrics Association, UP Chapter.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/this-surge-4-times-faster-caution-advised-for-kids/articleshow/88743206.cms||Shailvee Sharda

Budget estimates had far exceeded the initial projections mainly due to the need of eviction and rehabilitation of families who had for long settled near the canal.An order issued by coastal shipping and inland navigation department on availing funds from KIIFB for rehabilitation of evictees stated that in order to develop the waterways at par with national/state water way standards, eviction and rehabilitation to a great extent was necessary especially in Kovalam - Varkala stretch which required substantial amount of funds. Chief principal secretary to the chief minister had convened meetings to address the issues persisting in eviction and rehabilitation of families settled along the Kovalam-Varkala stretch of the proposed Inland waterway project and forwarded action plans regarding the rehabilitation and resettlement of 1,275 odd families in Kovalam Varkala stretch of inland waterway.About 372 families in Varkala area are to be rehabilitated at a cost of Rs 37.2 crore and 100 families in Veli-Kadinamkulam stretch will have to be rehabilitated at Rs 9 crore.Establishing a navigational channel from Kovalam to Akkulam forms part of a major project to revamp inland waterways transport which will run upto Kottapuram, Thrissur. Once the channel is made till Akkulam, it would be connected to Kollam from where the channel will form part of national waterways. This is being done to enhance transport of goods, tourism facilities and ferry service along Parvathy Puthanar. As per the project proposal, a navigational channel will be established over a distance of 16.1 kilometres from Kovalam to Akkulam. A minimum width of 25 metres has to be maintained and the channel will run at a depth of 2.2 metres across the entire distance between Kovalam and Akkulam. The district administration had successfully carried out the survey of Parvathy Puthanar covering over 60 km in 2018.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/govt-to-acquire-20-acres-pvt-land-to-rehabilitate-families/articleshow/88743996.cms||Aswin J Kumar

The deer was later spotted roaming around in a vacant plot at Kanaka Nagar. It was darted and transported back to the zoo. The animal was brought to a night shelter for observation. It was administered with an antidote and later released into the enclosure. The zoo officials said that the animal could be retrieved within an hour. Earlier a spotted deer had escaped from the enclosure and run into the residential colony at Kanaka Nagar. The zoo authorities said that work is underway on increasing the height of the compound wall. Owing to the large construction, repair work cannot be undertaken simultaneously and is being carried out in a phased manner, the officials said. There had also been instances where lion tailed macaque would escape from the enclosure and give a hard time for the zoo keepers. As per the master plan of the city zoo, for managing issues arising from animal escapes, a special team has been constituted under the leadership of the zoo superintendent. The team includes a veterinary officer and three trained and experienced animal keepers. The team is equipped with the latest tranquilizing devices and restraint equipment.Another team consisting of zoo curator, security staff and police officers has been formed to carry out the emergency evacuation. Mock exercises are carried out at regular intervals, the document says.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/hog-deer-jumps-off-enclosure/articleshow/88743997.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Dabbling in the geometry of art and space||Thiruvananthapuram: Santhosh Sadrak, a Baroda based artist, always had the dream to paint a large canvas. He got inspired by the paintings of Raja Ravi Varma as some of his paintings Santhosh happened to see as a child were about seven feet large. The dream was fulfilled when he joined for post-graduation at Rabindra Bharati University, Kolkata. Now, he has painted a 20 feet large geometric abstract painting.Titled as ´Latent Segment´ this 20 feet painting is the main attraction of the solo exhibition being organized by the Kerala Lalithakala Akademi at Vyloppilli Samskrithi Bhavan. It is a series of paintings in two panels which include the life incidents, emotions, things and travel experiences of the artist in geometric form. Apart from this, there are around 25 small sized geometric paintings. The pictures are painted on canvas cloth with acrylic paints. The artist has left the concept behind the painting to the visitors.As the canvas size is too big, wooden sticks have been used as the frames to give the exact shape. The artist has also tried to bring fresh colours to the art work. The expo has been organized as part of the annual academic grant given by the Kerala Lalithakala Akademi for the talented artists.“I believe that an artist always gets inspiration from his surroundings. I have referred to several national and international artists. My likes and ideas have also changed accordingly. Through latent segments, I have tried to include the elements from our daily life in the form of a geometric abstraction. But I would like to leave the concept behind the painting to the visitors as each has their own perspective. As my dream was to paint a big sized picture, let my picture also convey big. The emotions of the moment can make us complete the shape,” said the artist.While the large studio size in his university provided opportunity to paint a large sized picture, the lack of space in his house forced him to paint a total of 500 small abstractions which he later adopted in “latent segment”. The expo will end on January 9.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/dabbling-in-the-geometry-of-art-and-space/articleshow/88744000.cms||---

The SUCC cited some RTI information to second its argument that Priya Varghese, wife of CM’s private secretary K K Ragesh, does not possess the required qualification to be included in the rank list, in which she has emerged as the top rank holder.The RTI reply that Kannur University gave to the varsity senate member R K Biju underscored the argument that Priya was short of the minimum eight years of teaching experience UGC has prescribed for the post of associate professor. .The RTI reply indicates that Priya had earned doctorate degree only in 2019. After that she worked as the students’ service director of Kannnur University for two years. In June 2021, she re-joined Kerala Varma College, Thrissur, as teaching faculty and in July 2021 she joined Kerala Bhasha Institute as assistant director. In her application, it was mentioned that she had nine years’ teaching experience at Kerala Varma College. Her experience as guest lecturer at the college for two years was also mentioned. However, the three years she spent for PhD and two years’ deputation in Kannur University were not mentioned, the petition pointed out.If PhD is to be considered as the basic pre-requisite in this case, the candidate has only a month’s teaching experience and hence not eligible to be considered for the post, the SUCC observed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/succ-makes-fresh-appeal-to-sanitize-rank-list/articleshow/88744008.cms||---

Jamie Saavedra, global director for World Bank’s Education division former education minister of Peru, on Thursday said that the global average of closure of schools – full or partial – was 289 days. Against this, the closure period was 436 in South Asia including India. Saavedra was speaking at the International Conference of Academic Institutions (ICAI). He talked about the concept of learning poverty and said that poverty and economic development are closely related. “The learning poverty would increase due to the impact of Covid-19… Those who cannot read the texts of the lower standards would grow,” said Saavedra. Giving example of India, he said that a survey compared 2018 and 2020 results and found that 39% of the students in class VII could not read class II textbooks. Another speaker, Andreas Schleicher, head of OECD Indicators of Education System, stressed on seeing the technology as an enabler in the times of Covid with personalized learning system, newer assessment methods and devising strategy to find ways of getting the best out of hybrid mode of education. Anita Karwal, secretary of education of Government of India, said that the National Achievement Survey 2021 aims at diagnosis of learning loss or gaps. “The initiative like PRABANDH are launched to bring back the students who have dropped out for any reasons.

He was clarifying regarding anomalies in undergraduate and postgraduate (UG,PG) examination results, along with vice-chancellor P S Yadapadithaya and registrar Kishore Kumar C K, here on Thursday. PGCET counselling commenced from Tuesday. However, students under MU, who appeared for special BCom second-semester examinations held between December 7-23 are in a quandary, since their results are not yet out, and they cannot attend it. Dharma said that close to 30,000 students had appeared for the examination, and a majority of the candidates are from the commerce stream. “We wanted to start evaluation this weekend, but it was not possible due to the curfew. It will start from Monday. The entire process will be completed by the end of January,” he said. When asked if PG-CET aspirants will lose out due to MU’s unprecedented delay, Dharma said that MU has written to the Higher Education Council of Karnataka to exempt students and accommodate them, as their results are not yet out. “We are expecting a positive reply from the department. Meanwhile, MU has also made a plan to accommodate those students who want to pursue a PG course under the university, but are unable to apply due to the results,” he said. On the delay in declaring examination results and other anomalies, P L Dharma agreed that due to adoption of MULinx inhouse open software, things had gone wrong. “Around 38 colleges have come forth, citing anomalies in the UG result, and we have addressed them all. A help desk was created at MU, and anyone having issues with results can contact their college principal. It will be addressed on priority,’’ he assured. From this March onwards, MU will implement the Unified University and College Management System(UUCMS) examination software for first semester UG courses under the NEP programme. The use of MULinx will continue for other semesters, and will be discontinued in phases, said Dharma, adding that training for UUCMS has already begun in Bengaluru. PG results in a month The postgraduate results too have been delayed. Dharma said that the results will be declared within a month. He said that it was delayed due to a shortage of hands, and unavailability of external evaluators. P S Yadapadithaya said that MU is mulling to go for digital valuation for PG courses from next semester, and that an e-tender is being processed for the same. No discrepancies in laptop distribution Yadapadithaya, on the issue regarding distribution of laptops to SC,ST students, clarified that MU has followed due process to procure and distribute 100 laptops. “It is true that the cost of each laptop is high, and there is a reason behind it. Last time, MU had received several complaints, when cheaper laptops were distributed. The students complained that they were faulty. We did not want the same thing to repeat this time,” said the VC.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/second-semester-spl-exam-results-by-jan-end-mu/articleshow/88741325.cms||---

Pictures that went viral on social media show a shirtless worker without safety gear being lowered into the manhole by a rope. Dalit rights activist and independent MLA from Vadgam Jignesh Mevani tweeted these pictures saying that the worker was made to enter a manhole located near Navratri Chowk in Sector 3B. He tagged official twitter handles of state DGP, Gandhinagar collector, chief minister’s office and the prime minister’s office, demanding action against those responsible for violation of law as well as human rights. “This is a clear violation of Section 5 of the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and Their Rehabilitation Act 2013. It seems that the government and authorities are terribly indifferent towards the plight of sanitation workers. In the past few months, I have come across three such incidents where workers were made to enter a manhole without safety gears,” Mevani told TOI. The Act prohibits state and Union territories from employing workers for manual scavenging of sewer and drainage lines. In July 2019, in response to a writ petition by Manav Garima Trust, Gujarat government had submitted before the Gujarat High Court that state’s civic bodies have been directed to ensure that no person shall be asked to enter manholes to clean the lines.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/worker-made-to-enter-manhole-in-gnagar-without-safety-gear/articleshow/88744012.cms||Soumitra Trivedi

---||Ahmedabad||Wife flees with child, NRI moves Gujarat HC||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Thursday issued notice to the state government and a woman, who is a native of Gandevi in south Gujarat, after her NRI husband complained that she had disappeared with their daughter. The custody of the child had been granted to him by a court in Texas, he told court. The petitioner is a Tamilian living in Dallas city of Texas. The US citizen has sought the custody of his six-year-old daughter from his wife, who allegedly took the child without his knowledge during their India visit. According to details placed before the court, the petitioner, who is an IT professional employed with US defence services, had married the Gujarati woman in the US in 2008. A daughter was born to them in 2016. The father had to approach a district court in Dallas through a child protection committee to secure the child’s custody due to the mother’s alleged behavioural issues. She allegedly suffered from mental health problems. The petitioner’s lawyer submitted that the woman’s father had not been keeping well so the couple with the child flew down from the US. They visited the senior citizen living in Gandevi taluka of Navsari district. The father and daughter were scheduled to return to the US on August 30. However, on the day of the departure, the father realized the child was missing. Upon inquiry, he was told that his wife had taken away the child and disappeared. He then approached the high court and filed a habeas corpus petition, alleging that the administration had failed to pay heed to his complaint as he did not know Hindi or Gujarati. He alleged that his wife had taken away his passport and other travel documents too. He had to visit his native place and Delhi to equip himself with new travel documents, his lawyer submitted. Upon court’s query regarding the whereabouts of the woman, the lawyer said that she lived in Ahmedabad. The petitioner’s advocate cited various judgments to say that the habeas corpus petition was maintainable if a parent has forcibly taken custody of the child. The bench of Justice Sonia Gokani and Justice Mauna Bhatt said that the law in this regard is developed and the court would take a decision in the best of child’s interest. The high court has sought a reply from the government and the woman by February 1.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/wife-flees-with-child-nri-moves-hc/articleshow/88744020.cms||---

Moreover, it will be difficult for artists to travel.” But the good news is that the festival may recommence later this year. “We plan to resume in some form when the situation improves,” Joshi said. That will be a remarkable comeback for the annual music conference that runs uninterrupted for 13 days. Friday was to mark a solemn return: Pandit Sajan Mishra taking the Saptak stage without his brother and mentor. Some phenomena are complete only in a set of two. When Tolstoy is mentioned, Dostoevsky is invoked. When a memorable night is relived, the recollection is illuminated by the aura of stars. And when the Banaras Gharana is imagined, the images of Pandits Rajan and Sajan Mishra come together as naturally as prayer accompanies peace. Covid took away Pandit Rajan Mishra in April 2021. “I am missing my bhaiyya, my guru”, Pandit Sajan Mishra told TOI. “We had been singing together for 57 years.” Pandit Sajan Mishra was to perform with his son Swaransh. But another pair of musicians provided the valedictory recital on Thursday: sitarist Pandit Kushal Das and flautist Shashank Subramanyam. The choice brought the Hindustani-Carnatic equation into focus again. Vidhwan Kumaresh, a violin maestro, gave TOI a perspective. “It is one tree, two branches. It is intriguing that there are so many similar scales but are given different sound in the two systems,” he said. “An example of a parallel is Shankarabaranam and Bilawal and another is Hindolam and Malkauns.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/saptak-cut-short-may-return-in-2nd-raga-wave/articleshow/88744023.cms||Kannan Somasundaram

With discharge of 541 patients, the active cases shot up to 7,027. Analysis of daily cases revealed that the city recorded 5,000 cases in the past four days between January 3 and January 6. It had taken seven months to register the previous 5,000 cases, showing the very rapid rise of daily cases since start of January. On Thursday, the city contributed to 43% of the state’s total daily cases. From December 25 to 31, none of Gujarat’s districts were above 5% of weekly test positivity rate (TPR). Ahmedabad at 3.5% was the highest followed by 1.8% in Vadodara. In a matter of five days, Ahmedabad’s weekly TPR (from Dec 30 to Jan 5) shot up to 11.5%, according to the Union ministry of health & family welfare. Anand district (4.6%) came second and Bharuch (4.5%) came third of Gujarat in terms of weekly TPR. Ahmedabad Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (AHNA) figures revealed that there were less than 100 patients under hospitalization out of which 70 were under isolation and did not require any major medication or care. Experts said that it should be seen as a positive impact of vaccination, even as the number of fully vaccinated persons testing positive has increased in the past few days. The experts pointed at very low severity and mortality even when the number of overall cases are rising. Among other cities, Surat nearly doubled its daily tally from 610 to 1,105, becoming the second city after Ahmedabad to cross 1,000 daily cases in the current wave. Vadodara recorded decrease in cases from 150 to 103, whereas Rajkot recorded 30% rise from 141 to 183. Gujarat did not record any new case of Omicron variant in the past 24 hours.

A key officer close to the development said that for the past one week, the state government has been receiving feedback from government and private experts seeking further restrictions on large public gatherings to check the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. “A number of top national and international corporates who had earlier confirmed their partnership in the summit, also expressed their concern officially, and informed that their top leaders were not willing to take part in such large gatherings. These concerns also played a key role in final decision of postponing the event,’’ sources added. “However the state government was in a dilemma regarding VGGS. If the government continued with the plans to conduct the summit but imposed restrictions on other public gatherings, it would have sent an adverse message to the masses. This is why the government finally decided to postpone VGGS and impose restrictions on public gatherings,” said sources.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/corporate-feedback-need-to-curb-gatherings-influenced-decision/articleshow/88744034.cms||Kapil Dave

Industry estimates suggest that the five-star hotels stand to lose roughly Rs 30 crore worth of business due to the event being deferred. Narendra Somani, president, Hotels and Restaurants’ Association – Gujarat, said, “The industry will face a major setback with the postponement of VGGS 2022. Most five-star hotels in the city were 60-80% booked for the mega investment summit. Now, the industry will face direct losses worth at least Rs 15 crore from guests who had booked for VGGS alone. The loss will be from occupancy as well as food and beverage sales.” On an average, a hotel with brisk bookings does business between Rs 50 lakh and Rs 1 crore. Hoteliers have been facing cancellation of room bookings since Wednesday. “In the past two days, we have seen cancellations of at least 1,800 room nights for the month of January alone. This means an estimated 600 people would have cancelled bookings and more are likely,” said a city hotelier, not willing to be named. “With several events lined up, the first quarter had given a lot of hope in terms of recovery of business in the hospitality sector, which has undergone turbulent times through the pandemic. With the postponement of VGGS, the overall sentiment has taken a hit,” said Neelabh Chug, general manager, Renaissance Ahmedabad . On the brighter side, the hoteliers are expecting a positive sentiment in the coming quarters. “When cases recede, things will bounce back much faster,” said another hotelier.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/city-hotels-stare-at-30-crore-loss-as-guests-cancel-bookings/articleshow/88744037.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Ahmedabad||HC fines farmers for pleas that stalled project||Ahmedabad: In a rare occurence, the Gujarat high court imposed fines of Rs 2,000 each on 58 farmers for litigation that stalled the laying of a power transmission line for seven months following a stay order from the court which resulted in escalation of the project cost, which is a burden on public exchequer.This case involved 58 farmers from Simej and Roopgadh villages in Dholka taluka of Ahmedabad district. They were opposed to the passing of a 765 KV transmission line, which is being laid along 350km between Lakadia in Kutch and Waghodia in Vadodara. The Lakadiya-Vadodara Transmission Project Ltd issued notices to the farmers in January 2021 and the farmers challenged the laying of the line in their fields, saying it would diminish the value of their land, which would then not be put to beneficial use.The company informed the farmers that their land would not be acquired and they would be able to cultivate land under the line. Compensation would also be offered for damage to standing crops while erecting the pylons. The farmers moved the HC complaining about deviations in the lines and alleged that the alignment was not changed to benefit certain industrial units.In rebuttal, the company’s advocate S P Hasurkar cited judgments to submit that land owners cannot insist on a change in alignment of transmission lines.A single-judge bench had ordered the company to maintain the status quo in February 2021 and the stay order remained till September 2021, for seven months, till the court rejected farmer’s petitions. They then appealed before the division bench. Chief Justice Aravind Kumar and Justice Ashutosh Shastri dismissed the appeals with the observation, “The matters of drawing of transmission lines, electrical lines and telegraphic lines are in the domain of experts…The courts will not sit in the armchair of experts to examine technical issues which would have been gone into by the experts.”The division bench was not pleased with the stalling of the mammoth project for seven months. It said, “Such mammoth projects if stalled or are not proceeded within the time schedule, result in escalation of costs and thereby burdening the exchequer and consequentially, citizens are being made to pay. As such, we are of the considered view that petitioners are required to be mulcted with costs.”The judges further said, “Though in the normal circumstance, this court would have mulcted them with exemplary costs, we refrain from doing so keeping in mind that the petitioners are small farmers and a nominal cost of Rs.2,000 payable by each of them to the second respondent (the company) if imposed, would suffice.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/hc-fines-farmers-for-pleas-that-stalled-project/articleshow/88744038.cms||---

The appointment comes after the term of the earlier chairman, which had been extended on four occasions, lapsed. Patil has 25 years of experience in dealing with corporate sustainability, safety, and rehabilitation, reclamation and resettlement at several locations in India and abroad. He has successfully completed more than 25 environmental clearances to the mining sector and other industries in Goa, Karnataka, Odisha and Jharkhand. He is also behind ensuring environmental compliance at more than 15 sites across India and abroad. The new GSPCB chairman had taken a break from his regular job from September 2014 to date, during which time he converted a family farm into an eco-farm complete with plantations of spices, fruit and medicinal plants. The farm also boasts of a butterfly park, bamboo arboretum, water harvesting structures, and adventure sports, among other things. It has been developed into a nature conservation and education centre and adopts new agricultural practices while also creating livelihood opportunities for local communities, especially after closure of mining in Goa. In October, the department of environment and climate change advertised for the posts of chairperson and member secretary at the GSPCB.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/state-pollution-board-gets-new-chairman/articleshow/88736455.cms||---

Now, out of fear, they have left for the south.” The Union minister was in Lucknow to commission three new train services and scores of other infrastructure projects from Gomtinagar railway station. He said, “That family only took votes and gave nothing (to the people) in return.” “Today, there is a double engine government which is working for the benefit of everyone in Uttar Pradesh. Law and peace prevail in the state,” he said. The minister further said, “In earlier regimes, development works were on paper and there was only foundation stone laying, but now, the entire country is witnessing growth and development in infrastructure. In railways alone, projects worth Rs 97,000 crore are under construction.” Vaishnaw said, “Railways is redeveloping stations to prepare them for the upcoming challenges over the next 50 years. We have considered everyone in our vision—be it passengers, small-scale traders, farmers or big business houses. The railways in collaboration with postal service is set to introduce a goods delivery system for every corner of the country. An integration programme is under works for more than 1.5 lakh post offices and 8,000 railway stations.” The idea, he added, is to provide goods delivery service to even small-scale traders. “We have developed the Gati Shakti container of 2.5 tonnes which would be loaded and unloaded by a 5-tonne fork lifter instead of crane at any railway station. The container was under trial at Kathuwas railway station in Alwar, Rajasthan,” said the railway minister. This delivery system will help tribals of Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh as well as weavers of Varanasi to expand their business with the help of railways.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/gandhi-family-left-for-south-out-of-fear-says-railway-min-ashwini/articleshow/88743230.cms||Arvind Chauhan

Nabard will release the funds in a phased manner which will help the state government to put the medical college works on fast track. The works on three medical colleges which were cleared by the Centre have already commenced.  After giving an in-principle consent to grant the loan for construction of medical colleges, Nabard is reported to have asked the state medical and health department to submit the Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) of each and every college. Sources said Nabard has agreed to grant the loan at considerably low rate of interest keeping in view of the fact the government medical colleges are going to play a big role in strengthening the public healthcare system in the state. Though the Centre had sanctioned three medical colleges to the state, the works on the proposed healthcare institutions were lagging due to the paucity of funds. After the Covid-19-induced financial troubles, the state government had constituted Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) to each and every college in order to pool up financial assistance from the bankers. After long negotiations with different financial institutions, state government had prevailed upon Nabard to join hands to grant the loan. State government had also sought a separate loan from Nabard to renovate and strengthen the existing government medical colleges under Nadu-Nedu scheme with a cost of Rs 7,500 crore. This proposal is also under active consideration of Nabard.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/amaravati/rs-13k-crore-nabard-loan-for-16-medical-colleges-in-ap/articleshow/88741364.cms||Samdani MN

Its full-fledged functioning was originally scheduled in June 2020 and then it was to be made fully functional by September 2021. Unfortunately, the glitches are persistent even today. CAAS has raised the issue of glitch with the central authorities on several occasions and even offered its honorary services for testing the portal. But it did not receive any response and as the situation did not improve, the CA body moved the HC requesting that the tax authorities be directed not to levy fee and penalty for any delay in compliance due to technical issues with the portal.

These compensation rates were last revised in June 2016. The state government, through a notification issued late on Thursday, said that in case of human death the compensation has been raised to Rs 5 lakh from the existing Rs 4 lakh. For death of a cow or a buffalo, it has been raised from Rs 30,000 to Rs 50,000. Officials said that in the case of non-milch animals, the compensation was only increased from Rs 16,000 to Rs 20,000. The increase in compensation was much-awaited, as several MLAs and NGOs had been demanded it. A senior officer said that the last time the compensation was revised it was about 18 months before the 2017 election. This time too, assembly elections are due this year. Compensation will be paid only in cases involving lion, leopard, sloth bear, crocodile, wolf, hyena and wild boar. Though Gujarat does not have a tiger population, the government has also included tiger attack. An officer said that in February 2019, 27 years after a tiger had last been sighted in the state, one was spotted along the border with Maharashtra in Dang district. If a tiger was to foray into the state and attack a human or cattle, compensation for it can be paid, and tiger were thus included on the list. Forest department data on man-animal conflict reveals that leopard are the biggest killers in the state, having taken 109 lives in the eight years from 2012-12 to 2019-20. Crocodiles, whose burgeoning numbers in central and south Gujarat have become a cause of concern, claimed 45 lives. While lions are certainly scary, they have killed 13 persons in the state in this period. Data for 2020 and 2021 are yet to be released by the department.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/mananimal-conflict-compensation-hiked/articleshow/88744043.cms||---

Initially, the lift barely moved and then suddenly dropped to the ground floor.

The woman and her husband belong to Jotana taluka in Mehsana. They fell in love and married on September 2, 2021. They were living at Memnagar in the city after their wedding. She alleged in the FIR that her husband behaved well for about two months after their wedding, but later picked fights with her over petty issues.

Along with her husband, her in-laws, whenever they visited her house in Memnagar, humiliated her for coming from an SC community. She said they used caste-based slurs against her and even her husband insulted her, calling her “untouchable”. She then began opposing him and refused to have sex with him saying “how can you have sex with an untouchable”, the FIR states. Five months ago, when she refused to have sex with him, he thrashed her and since then he has raped her multiple times, she alleged in the FIR. On Monday, her husband again picked a fight with her and hit her with an iron rod till she fell unconscious.

Rakesh Shah, a businessman from Satellite, said in his FIR that he received a call from an unknown number around 4.16 pm on December 22. Around 15 minutes later, both his SIM cards got deactivated. He and his son immediately approached the telecom company outlet to get the cards activated. By then, one of the cards was reactivated, but the other was not. Shah was informed by the company’s employee that someone from Kolkata had made a request to cancel his sim card. Shah learnt that the request for cancellation was made from the same number from which he received the missed call. Suspecting something fishy, he checked his bank accounts and learnt that Rs 46 lakh was transferred from his bank account to three other accounts in 11 transactions. Elaborating on the modus operandi, a cybercrime expert said that the fraudsters, after securing their victim’s data such as details of their bank account, credit card, PAN number, address, date of birth and mobile phone numbers, get a fake PAN card made, and then get a new sim card issued in the victim’s name. Once the new sim card is issued, the victim’s mobile phone with the old sim card gets deactivated. This ensures the victim does not get alert messages pertaining to bank transactions while the money is being withdrawn from his account.

---||Visakhapatnam||Post clashes, fishing ban hits Visakhapatnam coast||VISAKHAPATNAM: The simmering discontent between the traditional fishermen and those using ring nets has resulted in fishing ban threatening the livelihood of community members ahead of the Sankranti festival. This also means that seafood lovers may miss their favourite dishes for some time. It may be recalled that tension prevailed at Vasavanipalem, a fishing hamlet in the coastal area of Vizag city on Tuesday, after two groups of fishermen clashed over use of ring nets. Six boats belonging to the two groups were damaged after some set them on fire. Eight persons were injured in the incident. The clash broke out between the fishermen of Chinajalaripeta and Pedajalaripeta over the use of ring nets in the restricted area of Bay of Bengal. The use of ring nets is banned by the AP government within 8 km from the coast. When a group of fishermen with ring nets were venturing into the waters for fishing in the restricted area, the other group with traditional nets protested and entered into a heated argument with them, both on the coast as well as in the sea. The argument led to clashes causing damage to the boats. “Normally, we earn between 500 and 700 a day by catching fish and selling them in the market. The demand for fresh sea fish is high in Vizag city. Now, we may lose our livelihood for some time as the district administration has imposed ban on fishing. We don’t know how many days the ban will continue,” said V Yellaji, a fisherman who uses traditional fishing net. “Over 10,000 fishermen depend on motorboats and traditional nets for fishing. But some use ring nets illegally. The clash has impacted our livelihoods. We are appealing the district administration to form a special team to seize the 70 ring nets in use and protect the livelihood of thousands of fishermen who use traditional nets,” said T Parasayya, leader of the fisherfolk community. “Ring nets deplete the fish stock as the nets catch small ones too. There is a need for a total ban on ring nets to save the marine species and to protect the livelihood of fishermen community,” said Ch Satyanarayana Murthy, president of Dolphin Boat Operators’ Welfare Association.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/post-clashes-fishing-ban-hits-vizag-coast/articleshow/88744065.cms||Nalla.Babu

Even though JMM expressed concerns at the alleged security breach in Modi’s convoy, the party claimed that Modi cancelled his scheduled rally after learning that not even 10% of the expected crowd of 70,000 had turned up.“From our past experiences, we can recall that Shah was due to address an election rally in Chakradharpur in Jharkhand during the 2019 Vidhan Sabha polls. But because of the miniscule presence of BJP karyakartas at the venue, Shah waited for three hours at the Ranchi airport,” Bhattacharya wrote. “The BJP adopts new ways to mislead the people of the country after sensing an inevitable defeat and takes the country’s politics to new lows,” Bhattacharya wrote.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/jmm-mocks-modis-security-breach-in-punjab-writes-to-sidhu/articleshow/88744070.cms||Dhritiman Ray

The last nationwide tiger census had projected zero tiger in PTR but officials had kept contesting the claims.“WII confirmed the presence of a tiger in the PTR based on the six scat samples which we had sent,” PTR’s field director Kumar Ashutosh said, adding, “As the genetic analysis of scat does not determine the gender, we can’t say any if it is male or female. Of the six scat samples, one was certified to be of a leopard.”Remaining samples were unfit for analysis by WII owing to technical reasons. Meanwhile, there are reports that a tigress and her cubs have surfaced in the Mahuadanr range of the reserve. “We have collected samples of scat and hair too in Mahuadanr range which have been sent to WII for genetic analysis,” Kumar said.

The strike has resulted in a complete shutdown of all the three HEC plants and a total disruption of production and delivery schedules.A decision to this effect was taken at a meeting of the Congress-led HEC Bachao Sangharsh Samity organised at the residence of the former union minister, Subodh Kant Sahay, on Thursday. All the eight registered trade unions operating at HEC have unanimously decided to lend their support to the January 10 gherao."HEC workers have been going without wages since July 2021. Since the proposed January 10 gherao is in the interest of the workers, we have decided to go full steam ahead. We have decided to block the main road leading to HEC headquarters. Since many state government offices such as Jharkhand Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd. and the state secretariat at Project Bhawan and Engineers Bhawan are located further down the road, all these offices too would stand paralysed by our blockade," Bhawan Singh, president, Hatia Mazdoor Union, affiliated to CITU, told TOI.“We once again appeal to the Congress, which is a part of the ruling JMM-led government in Jharkhand, to come to the aid of HEC and its workers without any further delay,” Singh noted, adding that the workers strike would continue, till an amicable settlement is reached. Addressing workers, Sahay said that he would be leaving for New Delhi on Friday for talks with the Union cabinet secretary on the HEC impasse.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/hec-workers-to-gherao-headquarters-on-jan-10-as-strike-enters-36th-day/articleshow/88744072.cms||Tapas Biswas
---||Lucknow||‘Cancelled exams on threat to fairness, put guilty in jail’||Lucknow: Handing out appointment letters to naib tehsildars and secondary school teachers on Thursday, chief minister Yogi Adityanath said that his government has made 4.5 lakh appointments over the past five years, and unlike the corruption prevalent before 2017, these appointments had been made in a transparent manner. He said that his government had no qualms in cancelling exams that seemed compromised, and those responsible for it are languishing in jail. “Before 2017, when appointments were announced, family members of the previous government used to descend like characters of Mahabharat to take their cut from these appointments,” the CM said. He handed appointment letters to 57 naib tehsildars, 141 lecturers and 69 assistant teachers who were selected by the Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission. Calling the new appointees the backbone of the state, the CM said that if they were compromised, the entire system would collapse. Under the previous governments, this backbone had collapsed but his government was going to take the state to new heights. “Good governance is not possible merely by changing the government. We need to change the entire system. Officers should get a chance to work in a positive environment. You must work as honestly as your recruitment process,” he said. Saying that the state’s image had undergone a massive change since BJP came to power in 2017, the CM focused on the various government schemes which he said had revolutionised the lives of people. He spoke about the importance of tehsildars in the implementation of various such schemes which are related with revenue. “Since the implementation of the Svamitva scheme by PM Narendra Modi, there has been robust development of rural areas through mapping and demarcation of village properties. This scheme has also provided ownership rights to the right owners which has ended disputes,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/cancelled-exams-on-threat-to-fairness-put-guilty-in-jail/articleshow/88743237.cms||---

It is the responsibility of a state government to make adequate security arrangements for the the Prime Minister, when he is travelling in a state. How could they have a farmers’ protest during the visit of the Prime Minister? Video clips of local policemen drinking tea with the protesters have gone viral. This shows the failure of the state government,” Kateel said. He also charged the Congress of hatching a conspiracy to defame the Prime Minister by flouting rules. “Indira Gandhi had declared emergency when she felt threatened over losing power. The security lapses in Punjab were a conspiracy by the Congress. People will reject the Congress completely, if they continue this in future,” he added. Padayatra to prove leadership by DKS: Kateel Flaying the padayatra for the Mekedatu project planned by the Congress, Kateel said KPCC president D K Shivakumar has planned it to prove his leadership over former chief minister Siddaramaiah. “They have planned the padayatra, as they fear that they will not be able to do well in the next assembly election. The state and central government will take initiatives to solve the Mekedatu issue. However, the Congress has taken up the issue only for political mileage. Siddaramaiah had not taken any initiative to solve the Mekedatu issue when he was the chief minister, and the Congress was at the helm in the Centre. Hence, this is a fight launched by D K Shivakumar to show his influence in the party over Siddaramaih. It is an internal fight of the Congress,” he said. The BJP leader also appealed to the Congress to drop the padayatra in the larger interest of public health. “Congress leaders will be held responsible if there is a spike in Covid-19 cases after their padayatra,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/dissolve-punjab-govt-if-cm-does-not-resign-kateel/articleshow/88741369.cms||---

In 2017, similar remarks by the AAP national convenor and Delhi chief minister, had prompted the Election Commission of India to take note of the remarks. The EC had issued Kejriwal a notice for allegedly promoting bribery in 2017, but Kejriwal and his party appear adamant to repeat their appeal. “Take money from other parties but vote only for Aam Aadmi Party,” the party’s Goa unit said in a twitter post. The party even urged voters to be “selfish” and take benefits both “before elections and after elections” from the political parties. AAP’s social media account said that, right before elections, other political parties distribute money and ‘gifts’ to buy votes. “Accept the money and their gifts. These corrupt parties have looted us for years. It is our money. When they come to you to buy your vote, don’t say no. Take the money. It is, after all, your money,” AAP said. It went on to say that no political party will know whether a person who accepted money voted for AAP. The bizarre election flyer even said that “God will be happy” with people who take money from other political parties, but vote for AAP. “Aam Aadmi Party cannot give money before elections because it is a clean and honest party. They don’t have money. But when Aam Aadmi Party forms government, they will give free electricity, every woman in your family will receive Rs 1,000 a month, they will make excellent schools for your children, all health services will be free and world-class hospitals will be built,” AAP’s e-flyer stated. AAP has promised to provide benefits equal to Rs 1 lakh per year after the elections. Ahead of the 2017 assembly elections, Kejriwal had campaigned in Chandigarh and in Goa where he had urged voters to ask for Rs 10,000 instead of the Rs 5,000 being offered by BJP and Congress.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/ignoring-ecs-2017-censure-aap-asks-voters-to-accept-money-from-bjp-cong/articleshow/88764625.cms||TNN

However, the Indian Medical Association’s Jharkhand chapter is worried about the high infection rate among the doctors of the city. As many as 11 doctors at Ranchi sadar hospital and over 50 undergraduate MBBS students at Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences have tested positive for Covid 19 in the past week. “The infectivity rate among the doctors is high but the symptoms are mostly mild.

---||Lucknow||Unveiling of statues is BJP’s strategy to blur caste lines||Lucknow: Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath is scheduled to unveil an 11-feet statue of his guru, Mahant Avaidyanath, in his stronghold of Gorakhpur on Friday in a development that could turn the political glare back on the politics of statues ahead of the state polls. BJP sources said the statue has been installed at Preetiganj in Bharaiya block under Campierganj assembly seat represented by BJP MLA Fateh Bahadur Singh, son of former UP CM Vir Bahadur Singh. Fateh Bahadur has won the Campierganj seat — formerly Paniara —five consecutive times representing different political parties, including Congress, BSP and BJP. Gorakhpur was the stronghold of Avaidyanath who first represented the seat in the Lok Sabha in 1970 as an independent. He lost in the 1971 general elections when Congress swept the polls but won it again in 1989 as Hindu Mahasabha candidate. He again won the seat in 1991 and 1996 on BJP ticket before passing the baton to his protégé, Adityanath, in 1998. Earlier, Avaidyanath had won the Maniram assembly seat in Gorakhpur five times since 1962. BJP, as a matter of fact, has been installing statues of party stalwarts, religious figures, and national heroes to lend the much-needed propulsion to its mass outreach. The saffron outfit had earlier invoked its founding member Deen Dayal Upadhyay in a big way in February 2020, when PM Narendra Modi had unveiled his 63-ft statue at Padao on Varanasi-Chandauli border. The party has also been highlighting the legacy of former PM Atal Behari Vajpayee by installing his statues at various locations. Months after his death in August 2018, BJP had installed a bust of Vajpayee in Balrampur, his initial political ground. The state government installed a 25 feet statue of Vajpayee at Lok Bhawan, Lucknow, in December 2019. Earlier this month, UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh unveiled Vajpayee’s statue in Sitapur. BJP has also fast tracked the installation of a 51-feet statue of Nishad Raj at Shringverpur in Prayagraj, a 51-feet high statue of Guru Gorakhnath in Gorakhgiri hill in Mahoba, a 40-feet statue of Maharaja Suheldev in Bahraich, and a 12.5-feet statue of Maharishi Valmiki in Valmiki Ashram, Chitrakoot. Experts said by unveiling these statues BJP is sending subtle Hindutva messages cutting across caste matrices in the Hindi heartland. The statues of Nishad Raj and Maharaja Suheldev are particularly important as part of BJP’s strategy to reach out to Nishads and Rajbhars among the Most Backward Classes. Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP), headed by Mukesh Sahni, too had promised installation of statues of bandit-turned-politician Phoolan Devi to promote her political ideology. Even the opposition, especially SP, has been indulging is statue politics with party chief Akhilesh Yadav promising to install statues of Parshuram in various districts, to woo Brahmin voters.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/unveiling-of-statues-is-bjps-strategy-to-blur-caste-lines/articleshow/88743240.cms||Pankaj Shah

The CBI has arrested 12 persons so far who made objectionable and derogatory cases against the judges and judiciary. Avutu Sridhar Reddy from Guntur, Jalagam Venkata Satyanarayana from Hyderabad, Guda Sridhar Reddy from Markapuram, Susvaram Srinath from Hyderabad, Darisa Kishore Kumar Reddy from Railway Koduru and Suddaluri Ajay Amruth from Hyderabad filed separate petitions before the high court for bail. The high court had earlier rejected their applications as the CBI opposed to the bail as the case is still under investigation. All of them moved bail petitions for the second time. Senior counsel P Veera Reddy argued on behalf of the petitioners saying that the case registered by the CBI under sections 153-A, 504, 505(2), 506 of IPC and section 67 of IT Act are not so severe to reject the bail. He said that there have been many instances where courts granted bail to the accused in similar cases. Veera Reddy further argued that the CBI had already filed charge sheet in the court and the petitioners are in jail for more than 60 days. As the charge sheet has been filed and there is nothing to investigate on the role of petitioners, bail can be granted to them he said. Considering the arguments of Veera Reddy, the HC granted bail to the accused with certain conditions. Justice D Ramesh directed the accused to appear before the investigation officer every Wednesday and Friday. They should submit two sureties worth Rs 50,000 each and they should not leave Vijayawada without informing investigation officer.

The NHAI says the project – after necessary land acquisition and approvals – should be ready in two years. The tender is floated for the stretch between Mysuru and Kushalanagar as the last-mile link between Kushalanagar and Madikeri has been put on hold, an NHAI source said. With the 10-laning of Mysuru-Bengaluru road nearing completion, travellers from Bengaluru will have an easy travel to Kodagu in about four hours, giving tourism a leg-up. Instead of expanding the existing Mysuru-Kushalanagar road, the Mysuru-Madikeri Economic Corridor Expressway Project, as it is officially called, will be developed on a new route with bypasses over Periyapatna, Hunsur, Bilikere and Mysuru. The NHAI’s Mysuru-Bengaluru Expressway project director BT Sridhar told TOI that the Madikeri project will bring down the travel time between Srirangapatna Cross (in Mandya district) and Kushalanagar to just one hour.

Justice Ch Manavendranath Roy passed orders after hearing the petitions filed by Thummala Gangi Reddy and T Umashankar Reddy challenging the orders given by Kadapa chief judicial magistrate allowing the CBI petition to turn Shaik Dastagiri as approver in the case. CBI arrested Gangi Reddy, Umashankar Reddy and Dastagiri as accused in the Vivekananda Reddy murder case. A preliminary charge sheet has also been filed in the case. Even as the investigation going, the CBI filed an application before the court as Dastagiri came forward to turn approver in the case. Contending the court’s decision to allow Dastagiri to turn approver, Umashankar Reddy and Gangi Reddy moved the high court. Senior counsels B Adinarayana Rao and T Niranjan Reddy argued that the courts should allow the accused to turn approver only when there is no evidence available. In the present case, the CBI is not depending on Dastagiri statement alone and it is relying on many other evidences. They have argued that once the statement under 164 CrPC was recorded, he cannot be allowed to turn approver by recording his statement again under 306(4)(a) of CrPC. They have further said that Dastagiri was nowhere in picture when the case was investigated by the state police and later by a special investigation team (SIT). CBI counsel A Chennakeshavulu sought time to submit the details sought by the high court. He said the CBI has followed due procedure in the case. The high court posted the matter for further hearing to January 20.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/viveka-murder-cbi-told-to-submit-prelim-charge-sheet-statements/articleshow/88744108.cms||Srikanth Aluri

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: PM Narendra Modi security breach drama to gain voters’ sympathy, says Congress||JAIPUR: The state Congress on Thursday lashed out at the BJP for playing politics over PM Narendra Modi's alleged "security lapse". The party alleged that the charge of prime minister's security breach during his visit to Punjab the other day was a 'drama' enacted as part of a conspiracy to discredit the Congress party and win sympathy before the upcoming assembly elections in five states. Addressing a press conference, chief minister Ashok Gehlot said that it is unfortunate that politics is being played on this issue. He said protest is a part of democracy and it has to be managed. As it is a way of venting out feelings, no one should feel offended. "The Prime Minister is not of a party but of the nation. His security is everyone's responsibility. Nation’s honour and prestige is attached to the post. It is unfortunate that politics is being played on this issue. PM should not have made such a remark ('made it back alive' remark by PM). His remark has put the Punjab CM and his government in poor light," said the CM addressing the media along with state party chief Govind Singh Dotasra. He said it would have been better to gracefully postpone the Prime Minister's rally in Punjab knowing that rain had occurred and chairs were vacant on the venue instead of levelling allegations against Punjab CM and the government. Gehlot said without Special Protection Group (SPG) nod, the PM’s entourage could not move if it was not approved by the PM himself. He said the SPG and intelligence bureau have a major role in PM security but no one talks about it. Adding further, he said, the BJP’s attempt to tarnish the Congress will not succeed as it believes in non-violence unlike the RSS-BJP, which is rooted in violence. He alleged that the BJP had created an atmosphere of hatred and tension among various communities in the country as part of their same thought process. He asked how long the BJP can play religion politics. Now people have realized the difference in their words and actions. Modi's visit to Ferozepur in Punjab was called off citing a major security lapse. The ministry of home affairs has taken cognisance of this serious security lapse and sought a detailed report from the Punjab government.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/pm-security-breach-drama-to-gain-voters-sympathy-cong/articleshow/88744119.cms||---

Such campaigns have been launched by the corporation many times, but nothing has changed till now. Hoardings can be seen on every roadside, on big poles, colony gates, footpaths, and even on dividers. Last year as well, the corporation removed illegal hoardings from many places although they were back in their original places days later. This has caused crores of revenue losses to the corporation and their own hoarding sites are not being sold. More than 500 hoarding sites of the corporation generate around Rs 15 crore of revenue. Last year, the corporation has increased the hoarding sites as well. Explaining the problem of illegal hoardings in the city, JMC-Greater mayor Sheel Dhabai said, “We are adamant that this time we will remove all the illegal hoardings. CM Ashok Gehlot has ordered to remove all hoarding sites. This has been a morale booster for us because a lot of politicians are violating this law.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/jmc-greaters-fresh-drive-against-illegal-hoardings/articleshow/88744124.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Despite being the solar hub, equipment makers skip Rajasthan||JAIPUR: Despite being the No. 1 state in the country for having largest solar power generation capacity, the desert state has failed to bring in investments in equipment manufacturing. In fact, it is at the bottom of the states and far behind the leading ones like Gujarat, West Bengal, Telangana, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu which have become major destinations for solar module manufacturers. TimesViewRajasthan’s position as a leader in solar power generation in the country has less to do with any government intervention and more to do with its natural advantages such as sunny days and large expanses of barren and semi-barren land. But without component and module manufacturing, the benefits that the state can gain from the solar industry are very limited. Officials need to reach out more to the manufacturing sector if they really intent to create largescale economic activity.With only about 165 MW module manufacturing capacity, Rajasthan even lags smaller states like Haryana and others where the solar power generation is insignificant. Industry representatives said without manufacturing of equipment, economic activities of a solar plant is very limited compared to other industries. “The state is diverting thousands of hectares of land for solar power generation. While it is playing a crucial role in contributing significantly to the solar mission of the country, the benefits for the local people are limited,” said Sunil Bansal, president of Rajasthan Solar Association. Bansal said the state has lost huge opportunities by not proactively reaching out to solar component manufacturers. “If the component industry takes off, it will create large number of job opportunities and innumerable ancillary activities which will lift the state’s economy in a major way. Sadly, this has not happened despite Rajasthan being the hub for generation plants,” added Bansal. Some in the industry said that solar has become a real estate play as the benefits are only related to the land, and there is no their value addition. “What the state is getting a subsidized rate by allotting land to solar power developers and an annual tax on land in addition to that, which is miniscule. That’s why the solar industry has not benefitted large segments of people, rather it has taken away pasture land and creating a water scarcity. Cleaning of solar panels require water,” said an industry representative. He said only manufacturing of components and modules can bring in benefits and the officials have no time to meet manufacturers and bring them into the state despite Rajasthan having large scope. Rajasthan has an installed capacity of 8,644 MW followed by Karnataka 7483 MW and Gujarat 6052 MW.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/despite-being-the-solar-hub-equipment-makers-skip-raj/articleshow/88744125.cms||Srikanta Tripathy

During NTCA meeting in New Delhi, which was chaired by Union minister of environment, forest and climate change Bhupendra Yadav, Kumari highlighted that no action has been taken by the Rajasthan government in this regard. Kumari said, “On November 10, 2021, the NTCA had sent the feasibility assessment report to the state government for appropriate action so that the process of declaring Kumbhalgarh and Todgarh Wildlife sanctuary as tiger reserve could be undertaken. Nothing has been done till date.” She urged chief minister Ashok Gehlot and the minister of state for environment Hemaram Choudhary to take needful action on the feasibility assessment report of the NTCA. “The reserves will also give a big boost to tourism and economy in the region,” she added. Earlier, after conducting a survey of the area, a four-member committee has found sanctuary potential as the fifth tiger reserve. In the draft report submitted by the committee suggested to declaring a 2,053 square kilometre area for tiger reserve after fulfilling certain conditions. The reserve will be spread across four districts such as Udaipur, Pali, Rajsamand and Sirohi. A forest official said, the committee had suggested developing the habitat in two phases. In phase-I, the 1,150 square kilometre land falling under the revenue department of Udaipur, Pali, Rajsamand and Sirohi districts was proposed to be transferred to wildlife. “The four districts will transfer 526 square kilometre forest lands to the wildlife. Similarly, 624 square kilometre revenue waste land will also be transferred, which will developed as buffer area,” said an official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/govt-drags-feet-on-declaring-kumbhalgarh-a-tiger-reserve/articleshow/88744129.cms||---

NSUI spokesperson Ramesh Bhati said, “This is not the right decision for the students as a university student should be given preference as she has done Honours specialisation from this university. We must be given preference and five percentage of marks is not a huge advantage.” Rashmi Jain, professor at Rajasthan University, and one of the admission committee members, said, “Until 2011, admission in post-graduation was done on the basis of under-graduate mark percentage. After that, we started admitting students on the basis of the entrance examination. Hence, this system was stopped. But last year due to pandemic, entrance examination couldn’t be conducted so admissions were given on the basis of an under-graduate percentage again.

---||Goa||Margao’s slum areas could decide poll outcome||Margao: With its face-hunting exercise to find a formidable candidate in Margao coming to a naught, BJP appears to have turned its crisis into an opportunity. The fall guy of Pernem, deputy chief minister Manohar Ajgaonkar, is now being seriously considered by the party as its candidate to take on Margao MLA Digambar Kamat. As both Kamat and Ajgaonkar are considered messiahs of Margao’s slum areas, it’s obvious BJP is eyeing these vote banks to give the opposition leader a run for his money. Ajgaonkar almost gave this away when he blamed Kamat for doing no development in Moti Dongor and Azad Nagar, previously known as Babu nagari, named after Ajgaonkar for obvious reasons. “You have stayed behind him (Kamat) and voted for him for 40 years. But what has he given you in return? He has only divided your (Muslim) community on the issue of kabrastan. Moti Dongor is lying without any development. There’s Azad nagar which I had created years ago; there’s no development there since,” Ajgaonkar had said on Thursday while speaking to protesters agitating over the change of zone in the land acquired for kabrastan. Muslims constitute a significant population of slum dwellers in both Moti Dongor and Azad nagar. These two slum areas, besides the hutments near Cine Lata which comprise voters from the Dalit community, are considered to be Kamat’s vote banks which, political observers say, turn decisive in weighing the scales in favour of Kamat every election. If Ajgaonkar does contest against Kamat, there is a likelihood of a split in these vote banks. The behaviour of the voters from these slum areas will prove crucial in determining the outcome of the upcoming elections in Margao, political observers say. As TMC is likely to field former Margao municipality chairperson Ghanashyam Shirodkar from Margao, a former aide of Kamat, and who wields significant influence in Moti Dongor, political observers say, he is also likely poll a sizable number of votes which have traditionally voted Kamat en bloc. President of BJP’s Margao mandal, Rupesh Mahatme, said that the proposal for fielding Ajgaonkar has been discussed with the core party workers of Margao, who he said, have been receptive to it. “It’s up to the party now to decide,” he said. Concurring with the suggestion that Ajgaonkar could divide Kamat’s slum-vote banks in favour, Mahatme said, “Ajgaonkar hails from Margao and has a strong base of supporters from all sections of society. Combine this with the party’s strength and he has good chances of winning from Margao.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/margaos-slum-areas-could-decide-poll-outcome/articleshow/88764645.cms||Govind Kamat Maad

Total 808 cases have been recorded in these areas, and nearly 50 percent of them are from the posh Athwa zone. Total 220 cases were from Rander area, and 104 in Varachha A. Meanwhile, vaccination for teenagers was discontinued on Friday. Sources in the health department informed it was discontinued owing to shortage of Covaxin vaccines, but will resume from Monday in schools and colleges. For other age groups as well, Covaxin will not be available at vaccination centres on Friday. Vaccination for the adult beneficiaries is likely to resume on Saturday.

---||Surat||Only 2.68% of +ve cases hospitalized||Surat: Out of total 112 Covid-19 patients hospitalised in the last three months, only 10 were unvaccinated while 94 were fully vaccinated and eight were partially vaccinated. Explaining the figures, health officials of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) claimed that over 34 lakh people have been vaccinated in the city, so among the hospitalised the number of vaccinated people will be higher. In October last year, Surat city achieved 100% vaccination for the first dose. Since then, one death due to Covid-19 was reported that too in December. However, the vaccination has drastically improved the overall hospitalisation of nearly 2.68% on Thursday which used to remain over 10% in the first two waves. Out of 3,054 active cases on Thursday, 82 are hospitalised. “In the first two waves, nearly 10% required hospitalisation. But due to vaccination, the hospitalisation is nearly 2.68% today,” said an SMC health official. “Since we have covered over 34 lakh population, the majority of patients who will be hospitalised are vaccinated. Of course, their health condition would not become critical like in the past two waves,” said a health official. According to Cowin data, 73 lakh doses have been administered to beneficiaries till now, of which 41 lakh got the first dose while 32 lakh got both doses. Of the total doses, 50 lakh doses were given to the 18-44 age group and 15 lakh doses to 45-60 age group. In the above 60 age group, 6 lakh doses were given while in the 15-18 age group 1 lakh doses were administered.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/surat/only-2-68-of-ve-cases-hospitalized/articleshow/88744137.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

It is the responsibility of a state government to make adequate security arrangements for the the Prime Minister, when he is travelling in a state. How could they have a farmers’ protest during the visit of the Prime Minister? Video clips of local policemen drinking tea with the protesters have gone viral. This shows the failure of the state government,” Kateel said. He also charged the Congress of hatching a conspiracy to defame the Prime Minister by flouting rules. “Indira Gandhi had declared emergency when she felt threatened over losing power. The security lapses in Punjab were a conspiracy by the Congress. People will reject the Congress completely, if they continue this in future,” he added. ‘Padayatra to prove leadership by DKS’Flaying the padayatra for the Mekedatu project planned by the Congress, Kateel said KPCC president DK Shivakumar has planned it to prove his leadership over former CM Siddaramaiah. “They have planned the padayatra, as they fear that they will not be able to do well in the next assembly election. The state and central government will take initiatives to solve the Mekedatu issue. However, the Congress has taken up the issue only for political mileage. Siddaramaiah had not taken any initiative to solve the Mekedatu issue when he was the chief minister, and the Congress was at the helm in the Centre. Hence, this is a fight launched by D K Shivakumar to show his influence in the party over Siddaramaih. It is an internal fight of the Congress,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/kateel-dissolve-punjab-govt-if-cm-channi-does-not-resign/articleshow/88744143.cms||---

It is a protest for water and our rights, not a rally for political purposes. Why should the BJP oppose it, when we are holding a padayatra for the benefit of the people?” questioned D’Souza. He said the party workers will follow Covid guidelines while participating in the protest.  “BJP is referring to Covid-19 and Omicron, to prevent Congress from holding the rally. However, no restrictions are in place for the programmes being held by the BJP. Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai has participated in a programme that witnessed participation of thousands of people, and even the Prime Minister has been travelling the length and breadth of the country, to take part in public programmes,” he added. On the security lapse during the visit of PM Narendra Modi to Punjab, D’Souza said, “Let the BJP government order a probe and take necessary action against officials responsible, if security lapses are found.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/ivan-workers-from-dk-udupi-will-take-part/articleshow/88744144.cms||---

As on Wednesday, the number of active cases in DK increased to 441, while the number reduced to 352 in Kasaragod.The Dakshina Kannada district administration has increased its surveillance measures throughout the district, especially on the Kerala-Karnataka border, to reduce the number of daily cases.DHO Dr Kishore Kumar M told TOI that inter-state commuters from Kerala cannot be blamed at this juncture, when cases are seen everywhere.“We have been witnessing a spike in cases across the district, not only among students from Kerala. In addition to students, cases are being reported among the public too in the district. Though we have been witnessing a spike in cases, the death rate is the lowest, and those tested do not have severe symptoms. Other than slight headache and cold, the majority of those tested do not show any symptoms. Our test positivity rate (TPR) was less than 1% till recently, even when the TPR was above 10% in Kerala. However, the situation is different now. We have also witnessed an increase in cases, when the tally goes up in Maharashtra. People from Dakshina Kannada settled in Maharashtra visit during the year end for festivals, and that also could be a reason for the spread of the virus here,” the DHO said.“The district has been continuing with surveillance measures at all places, even on the inter-state border. The health department is now working to contain the spread of the virus further,” he added.Dr Ashok H, nodal officer for Covid-19 in Dakshina Kannada, said that the number of cases is increasing across the district, as predicted earlier. “The number of daily cases in Dakshina Kannada is increasing every day, despite all measures being in place. We have directed educational institutions in the district to follow the guidelines strictly. We have been conducting an average of 11,000 tests per day in the district,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/now-dk-dist-has-more-active-covid-cases-than-kasaragod/articleshow/88744146.cms||Vinobha K T

However, students under MU, who appeared for special BCom second-semester examinations held between December 7-23 are in a quandary, since their results are not yet out, and they cannot attend it. Dharma said that close to 30,000 students had appeared for the examination, and a majority of the candidates are from the commerce stream. “We wanted to start evaluation this weekend, but it was not possible due to the curfew. It will start from Monday. The entire process will be completed by the end of January,” he said. When asked if PG-CET aspirants will lose out due to MU’s unprecedented delay, Dharma said that MU has written to the Higher Education Council of Karnataka to exempt students and accommodate them, as their results are not yet out. “We are expecting a positive reply from the department. Meanwhile, MU has also made a plan to accommodate those students who want to pursue a PG course under the university, but are unable to apply due to the results,” he said. On the delay in declaring examination results and other anomalies, P L Dharma agreed that due to adoption of MULinx inhouse open software, things had gone wrong. “Around 38 colleges have come forth, citing anomalies in the UG result, and we have addressed them all. A help desk was created at MU, and anyone having issues with results can contact their college principal. It will be addressed on priority,’’ he assured.From this March onwards, MU will implement the Unified University and College Management System(UUCMS) examination software for first semester UG courses under the NEP programme. The use of MULinx will continue for other semesters, and will be discontinued in phases, said Dharma, adding that training for UUCMS has already begun in Bengaluru. PG results in a monthThe postgraduate results too have been delayed. Dharma said that the results will be declared within a month. He said that it was delayed due to a shortage of hands, and unavailability of external evaluators. P S Yadapadithaya said that MU is mulling to go for digital valuation for PG courses from next semester, and that an e-tender is being processed for the same.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/second-semester-special-exam-results-by-jan-end-mu/articleshow/88744147.cms||---

We will take steps to invite applicants in these wards and strengthen ward committees to function in their full capacity,” Shetty said. “Mangaluru is the second city in the state to implement ward committees. The members have many responsibilities. They need to assess the facilities and infrastructure in the ward, ensure solid waste management happens effectively and timely collection of taxes, prepare and submit ward development schemes to the corporation among others. Hence, it is important that ward committees meet every month to enhance transparency, accountability and smooth functioning,” he said.

This follows after pictures and videos of a section of students wearing saffron shawls on campus went viral on Wednesday. Purushothama KV, principal of the college, said that at the co-ordination committee meeting on Thursday, it was decided that neither headscarves (hijab) nor saffron shawls will be allowed on campus henceforth.The meeting was attended by leaders of both communities (representatives from a mosque committee and BJP leaders), old students, members from the governing council, representatives from the joint director’s office, police department and panchayat. The decision of the governing council that met early in the day was conveyed to the members. Those who attended the meeting agreed with the college’s decision that only prescribed uniforms will be allowed.The principal said that Muslim students had been wearing headscarves inside the classroom since five years, and nobody had raised an issue. However, on Tuesday about 34 students came with saffron shawls draped around their neck, without submitting any memorandum or request to the principal or the management.“When I asked them if there was any specific reason for them to come in shawls, like if they were going to Sabarimala, they said that if Muslim students are going to come in headscarves, they will come in saffron shawls,” he said. Following this, an emergency meeting of the governing council was held, and then a meeting of the stakeholders. Local organisations are reportedly supporting the students. A Bajrang Dal leader had allegedly warned the college that Hindus should be allowed to wear saffron shawls, if Muslims are allowed to wear headscarves.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/college-to-students-no-headscarves-no-saffron-shawl-wear-prescribed-uniform/articleshow/88744153.cms||---

Another NMC health official said earlier, Cidco division registered maximum cases. But most of the residents in the Cidco division had tested Covid positive and a herd immunity might have developed there. “The infection was comparatively low in Nashik West division during the first and second wave, but the trend has now changed.

Speaking to reporters here after reviewing the Covid situation in the district, Bhujbal said the denial or rations to the unvaccinated would be on the lines of the “no vaccine, no entry” system being implemented in all government and semi-government offices, shops and establishments, and malls in the district. “Since there are few who are not taking their shots for no valid reason, we may be compelled to deny them rations, especially in districts where the vaccination figures are very low,” said Bhujbal. Noting that the number of active Covid and Omicron cases were rising in the state, Bhujbal said vaccination was the only way to cut down the severity of the Covid infection. He said the second vaccine dose should be taken within the prescribed time after the first dose, adding that delay would render the jab as waste.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/bhujbal-hints-at-ration-denial-to-unvaccinated/articleshow/88744172.cms||Abhilash Botekar

But during the course of inquiry, he failed to answer queries appropriately, that led to his arrest. Confessions by him led to the arrest of the second accused, who allegedly helped him with the identity card and uniform. Senior police inspector Kundan Jadhav, of the Deolali Camp police station, said, “The accused — Mohammad Asad Mujibullakhan Pathan and Aftab Mannan Sheikh, alias Major Khan — were arrested after military intelligence and military police registered an FIR against them for allegedly impersonating a military personnel and trying to enter the high-security zone.” Police have slapped section 170 of the IPC and section 6 of the Official Secrets Act (unauthorised use of uniforms, falsification of reports, forgery, personation and false documents) against the accused duo.

The accused claimed he was an ex-servicemen and showed the identity card of Ex-Indian Army Security Services. Since there is no such organisation, the guard referred the matter to his seniors. Inquiry revealed that Pathan was a former maulana of a masjid inside the campus and was removed. He wanted to gain entry for some reason, and for that, he took help of the second accused.Police said both of the accused are residents of Nashik city and Khan is known to have conducted classes for defence force aspirants.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/imposter-tries-to-enter-deolali-artillery-centre-2-arrested/articleshow/88744174.cms||---

Although officials have cleared nearly 60% of these applications – 2.7 lakh – none has been issued yet, infuriating applicants. The delay in issuance of a ration card has only added to the already long list of problems of the underprivileged.The department of food and civil supplies was to begin issuance of ration cards to applicants, the credentials of whom had been examined and verified, in August 2021. But the second wave of the pandemic delayed the process. On December 17, 2021, commissioner of food and civil supplies department Shamla Iqbal issued an order to officials in all districts, asking them to issue ration cards to those whose applications had been cleared. However, officials in many districts, pointing to the long queues in front of the office, have expressed their helplessness in commencing the process.In Dharwad district, for instance, authorities are issuing cards to families dealing with emergencies, but only after the food inspector and other officials have verified the credentials of the applicants.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/4yrs-on-4-5l-still-wait-for-ration-cards-across-ktaka/articleshow/88744175.cms||---

He said some people peel away at the stems and leave the bruised tree like that a few days. As the damaged stem and roots don’t get enough water and nourishment because of the damage, the tree dries out and dies. Later, they submit applications demanding that the dried dead tree be chopped off.Harshavardhan told TOI that a big tree is being killed at Kuvempu Road, Navanagar, Hubballi. “The circumference of the stem is about 123 inches and its peel is being chiselled out regularly. Once the peel is chiselled out, tree goes dry gradually. Probably the same miscreants also apply for the felling of the tree and get a nod from the forest department,” he said.He said that although he had drawn attention of the forest department, the HDMC and elected representatives through Facebook and Twitter to this practice, no one has acted or responded.Yashpal Kshirsagar, the deputy conservator of forests in the Dharwad division, said: “We are authorised to permit the cutting of trees that are unsafe for citizens. There are some rules before issuing permission. However, we are not entitled to keep a vigil on the practice of killing trees slowly. In Bengaluru, BBMP has its own mechanism. In other cities, it’s not clear. However, if we receive any complaint, we will attend and prevent such efforts.”Rajanna, a shopkeeper in Dharwad, said that such a practice has been on for years. “Many times, the lack of coordination between departments like the forest, Hescom, HDMC, push citizens to cut trees illegally. A citizen in Navanagar had approached the forest department requesting to cut a tree because its branches were touching power cables a year go. Hescom switched off the power supply but the forest personnel did not make it to the spot. This went for six months. Then, the resident paid a bribe to a contractor and it was cut in a day,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/activists-hint-at-conspiracy-to-slowly-kill-trees-in-twin-cities/articleshow/88744177.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

In fact, when the project received the central government’s approval, it was met with jubilation by a section of the public, who had been demanding direct railway connection between the two districts. The existing railway line between the two districts runs via Londa, prolonging the duration of the journey, whereas the new line is expected to reduce the time by half.Farmers in villages across which the new line is expected to run through, fear loss of livelihood. Scores of farmers in this section of Belagavi are engaged in the cultivation of paddy and other crops, and acquisition of land for the railway line will leave them with no prospects.Saraswati B, one of the farmers leading the agitation, said that the government must change the route of the proposed railway line, or drop the project altogether. “We will not relent at any cost,” she said. On January 3, farmers had gathered in front of the deputy commissioner’s office, demanding the cancellation of the project. “The Centre must resolve this dispute,” Saraswati said.Fellow farmer Laxman Patel pointed out that the project would eat into hundreds of acres of fertile land. “How can the state government, which claims to protect the farmers, ask them to sacrifice arable land for this railway line?”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/belagavi-farmers-oppose-railway-line/articleshow/88744179.cms||---

A flying/ pilot training school will come up in Hubballi airport soon, thanks to the efforts by Pralhad Joshi, Union minister for Parliamentary affairs.Joshi had requested then Union civil aviation minister, Hardeep Puri, and present minister Jyotiraditya Scindia to set up a flying training school in Hubballi. Responding positively, Scindia has initiated action in that direction. Joshi has thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Puri and Scindia.Joshi told TOI on Thursday that youths from north Karnataka aspiring to be pilots had to go Bengaluru for training — an expensive affair. “There is shortage of pilots in the country, and according to directorate of civil aviation, nearly 40% of the pilots in India are trained abroad. With a training school coming in Hubballi, many youngsters from middle-class families can afford to undergo training,” the Dharwad MP said.Meanwhile, the Union ministry of civil aviation has also permitted setting up of Flying Training Organisation (FTO) at Belagavi and Kalaburagi airports. Union minister of state for civil aviation, Gen VK Singh, in a reply at Rajya Sabha in December 2021, stated that they have permitted setting up of FTOs also at Jalagaon (Maharastra), Khajuraho (MP) and Lilabari (Assam).As of now, Karnataka has 14 FTOs — 12 in Bengaluru, one each in Hubballi and Mysuru. The FTO at Jakkur airport in Bengaluru is run by the government while the others run by private firms. They charge approximately Rs 20-25 lakh to train the aspirants.Belagavi airport was established in 1942 and Indian Airlines started operations in 1947. Kalaburagi airport is the latest to start operation in 2019.Bidar in north Karnataka has an Air Force Station established during the World War II. It has a premier flying training school run by Indian Air Force.

While recounting his experience travelling on Golden Quadrilateral road he stated that all highways except those in Karnataka are in good condition. In Karnataka, many roads are in bad condition with potholes at some places, he said. He travelled through Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Tamil Nadu, and returned to Hubballi. His next goal is to ride the bike from Hubballi to Kashmir and then to Kanyakumari.

---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: With votes equally placed, mayor’s seat may be a toss-up||CHANDIGARH: With 14 votes each, both Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and BJP are trying their best to reach the magic number which will help them clinch three seats of mayor, senior deputy mayor and deputy mayor. Both parties have set their sights on the lone SAD candidate. Since the SAD is yet to decide whether to participate in the election or not, sources said both AAP and BJP are trying their best to win him over to their respective sides, with little success. If the SAD, like the Congress, also decided to abstain from the mayoral election and the two contesting parties tie at 14 votes, a toss will have to be held to decide who the mayor will be. According to the rules, in case of equal votes on both sides, a toss is the only available option. In such a case, both contenders would have to rely purely on luck. Sources said that senior leaders of the SAD would decide what role the sole party will play in the mayoral election. “The situation has reached the stage where nobody can do anything except for trying to convince candidates of rival parties to support us in the name of development, which is not looking possible at all. Congress’s decision to abstain from the mayoral election has completely changed the scenario,” sources in the BJP said. A senior AAP leader said, “Since this is secret voting for the mayoral poll, if somebody wants to associate with us for development of the city and welfare of Chandigarh residents, we will welcome them, otherwise, let luck decide the fate of both these political parties.” Such a situation has emerged for the first time in the history of the MC since its inception in 1996.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/with-votes-equally-placed-mayors-seat-may-be-a-toss-up/articleshow/88744189.cms||Deepak Yadav
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: AAP tucks councillors away in Kasauli ahead of mayoral polls||CHANDIGARH: After returning from New Delhi in a day to file nomination papers for the all three posts of the Mayoral election on Tuesday, all the 14 newly-elected municipal councillors of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) have now gone to Kasauli. The councillors are likely to come back by late Friday. With only a day left for polling for the Mayoral election scheduled on Saturday, sources said that both AAP and BJP want to save their councillors from each other. Fears of cross-voting or defection plague senior leaders of both parties. “None of the senior leader of the local leadership of the party from Chandigarh has gone to Kasauli, but all newly-elected councillors of the party have gone there to enjoy in isolation. The senior leadership of the party in New Delhi is aware about this and they have been briefed about the same,” sources said. Since all the 14 elected councillors of AAP are new and don’t have any political experience, sources in the party said that they were being approached by people constantly, which they shared with the party’s national leadership. Therefore, the party had taken them to New Delhi on Monday. However, since they had to file nomination papers, they came back on Tuesday. Congress councillors have been staying in Rajasthan since Monday while BJP took its councillors to Shimla soon after filing of nomination papers on Tuesday. Now, AAP councillors are in Kasauli. Cross connectionsSince many political leaders of different parties know each other. AAP’s mayoral candidate Anju Katyal’s husband Satish Katyal and BJP leader Pardeep Bansal have been partners in a real estate business for many years. Sources said a few people tried to connect Bansal and Katyal on the political turf too, but were not successful.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/aap-tucks-councillors-away-in-kasauli-ahead-of-mayoral-polls/articleshow/88744190.cms||Deepak Yadav
---||Goa||Prices of vegetables rise as supply drops||Panaji: A sudden drop in the supply of vegetables at the wholesale market has pushed its price soaring in the retail market. The rising price of green vegetables is therefore pinching the pockets of the common man along with their household budget. “The winter crop is expected to bring in good availability of green vegetables and that should gradually bring the rates down to a lower price. However, this year, so far, unseasonal rain has wreaked havoc in the quality and quantity of crops coming to Goa from neighbouring states and weather conditions are further causing a problem in the shelf life of these greens,” said vegetable vendor Ali Shaikh. Goa mainly sources its vegetables from Belagavi in Karnataka and parts of Maharashtra. The price of onions has seen an increase by Rs 10, going at Rs 60 per kg this week as compared to Rs 50 for the same quantity last week. In addition to this, cauliflower has seen a hike of Rs 20, selling at Rs 60 now. The prices of some of the greens have touched Rs 120 per kg in the retail market showing a 50% increase. These are beans and capsicum, which until last week, were selling at Rs 60 per kg. The golden corn, which was sold at Rs 50 for five units, is now seeing its price doubled with it going at Rs 100 for the same quantity. Selling at Rs 60 per kg, the common kitchen ingredient — green chilli — is also out of bounds for the common man. Tomatoes on the other hand have seen a price drop, going at Rs 60 per kg now as opposed to Rs 80-100 last month. Green peas have seen a 50% decrease in price going at Rs 60 per kg as opposed to Rs 120 for the same quantity last week.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/prices-of-vegetables-rise-as-supply-drops/articleshow/88742870.cms||---

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Dharam Sansad seers plan ‘revenge meet’ in Haridwar after police action||HARIDWAR: Around a week after FIRs were lodged over the Dharam Sansad hate speech, seers here have planned a 'pratikar sabha' or 'revenge meeting', in retaliation to police action in the case. The meeting, to be held at Bairagi camp in Haridwar on January 16, will be organised on a “scale larger than the Dharam Sansad and religious leaders from across the country, of every akhara, will be invited”, Swami Anand Swarup, convenor of the Dharam Sansad core committee, said on Thursday. “Safeguarding our religion is our duty. Even if it’s a crime, we will continue to do it,” Swarup told TOI. On the government recently constituting an SIT to probe the case, he said, “Both Congress and BJP are equally bad for seers”. The decision to have the 'pratikar sabha' came about after an emergency meeting of seers held in Haridwar on Wednesday night to discuss the situation in the wake of police cases against Dharam Sansad participants. “The event is being talked about nationally and internationally. It is now to be ensured that discussions are seen in the right perspective,” Swarup said. He added, "What crime have sadhus committed to attract the charges levelled against them? What justifies the constitution of an SIT against them? Seers are being harassed. If we are to be arrested, we will surrender at the chief minister’s office." The Dharam Sansad was a closed-door event organised between December 16 and 19 at Ved Niketan Dham at Bhopatwala in Haridwar. After it ended, videos of the event emerged, showing speakers making provocative speeches against minorities, with one speaker even issuing death threats to former PM Manmohan Singh for his “minority-appeasement views”. The issue sparked widespread outrage, with rallies being held in Dehradun and Haridwar, demanding action against perpetrators, and former DGPs of Haryana and UP writing to Uttarakhand government over its alleged inaction in the matter. So far, two FIRs have been registered in the case, and over 10 persons booked. A five-member SIT was formed on January 2. However, no arrests have been made yet. The first FIR in the case was registered on December 23 against five persons, including the priest of Ghaziabad’s Dasna temple and the conclave’s organiser Yati Narasinghanand and one of the participants Jitendra Naryan Tyagi (formerly chief of Shia Waqf Board Waseem Rizvi), under sections 153-A (promoting disharmony, enmity or feelings of hatred between different groups on the grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc) and 295 (destruction, damage, or defilement of a place of worship or an object held sacred, with intent to insult the religion of a class of persons) of the IPC.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/in-retaliation-to-police-action-on-dharam-sansad-seers-plan-revenge-meeting/articleshow/88741461.cms||Sheo S Jaiswal

Recently, the administration had asked the Chandigarh Renewable Energy and Science and Technology Promotion Society (Crest) about the progress report on installation of solar plants. The administration had recently also filed review petition before the Joint Electricity Regulatory Commission (JERC) for implementation of Resco (Renewable Energy Service Company) model for installation of solar plants in city. Recently, the power regulatory commission had turned down administration’s plea for implementing Resco model. The Crest had moved JERC for implementing Resco model. The project's nodal agency had proposed this model after the approval of former UT administrator V P Singh Badnore as residents were wary of the initial capital investment. The ministry of new and renewable energy has already enhanced the city’s solar power generation target from 50 megawatt (MW) to 69 MW, to be achieved by 2022. Till date UT has achieved generation of around 46 MW.

However, with fresh demands medical store owners are now restocking their shelves with Ayurveda medicines and herbal health boosters. In Rajkot, on one day the number of cases increased by 400 percent after 141 people tested positive in the city on Wednesday, while 36 had tested positive on Tuesday.“The demand for Chayavanprash, Ukala powder, gargle liquid and Ayurvedic tablets have increased by around 15 to 20 percent in the recent times,” Mayursinh Jadeja, president of Rajkot’s chemist and druggist association told TOI.

---||Rajkot||Atmanirbhar farmers start organic mart||RAJKOT: A group of nearly two dozen farmers in Junagadh have embraced the spirit of entrepreneurship by not just growing organic produce but adding value to the products and selling them independently. What’s more, the farmers have started a small mart of their own in Junagadh city and have touched an annual turnover of Rs 30 lakh. Hitesh Domaliya, a farmer in Vadal village, 12 km from Junagadh city, decided to switch to pesticide-free farming five years ago. He grew mixed vegetables first but it was difficult to find buyers as these were costly. Domaliya then invited academicians and professionals from Junagadh at his farm for ‘bhajiya’ party and showcased his farming method. They were all impressed and promised to purchase vegetables from him. Domaliya then encouraged other farmers to follow his path and purchased ghani (cold press) to extract oil from groundnut with an idea that if farmers can add value to the product they can earn more. He got success in marketing pure oil and got customers in Junagadh. Domaliya said, “There are nearly 25 farmers who have joined hands with me. We sell 100 tins (each of 15 kg) of groundnut oil every season. We sell grains, oils, flour, milk and other products and our yearly turnover has reached Rs 30 lakh per annum.” The profit sharing is simple. The farmers get the value of their product after deducting labour cost as soon as the items are sold from the mall. The biggest advantage of this model is the banishing of middle-men who took away a huge share of their earnings. According to farmers, the cost of their product is more compared to market price because it’s organic, but by selling it in an organized way they get a good price. The value addition also brings more profit. “The cost is high because we grow organically and deal in small quantities compared to big traders, so we have to pay more labour charges. But our customers do not hesitate in paying,” said a farmer. They have also started home delivery of products. Devji Thummar, who grows sugarcane, now also makes jaggery out of it as a value-added product and sells it in the mall. “I have been adding value to sugarcane for the last few years which has resulted in good profit. Every year, I sell nearly two tonnes of jaggery now.” These farmers are now planning to form a farmers producer company (FPO) to increase their reach of customers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/atmanirbhar-farmers-start-organic-mart/articleshow/88744200.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

Amid a hung verdict in Chandigarh Municipal Corporation, the BJP councillors are camping in Shimla for last few days. Neither BJP nor AAP has the required number to reach the magical figure of 18 to clinch the power in Chandigarh Municipal Corporation and both parties are trying to keep its flock together. Amid the fear of possible horse trading, BJP has brought its newly elected councillors to Shimla. In Shimla, initially the BJP had not disclosed about the presence of Municipal Councillors from Chandigarh but after Punjab episode, it announced that BJP Councillors from Chandigarh led by Chandigarh unit general secretary Ramvir Bhatti will stage a protest against the Punjab government at Chaura Maidan in Shimla on Thursday.With the help of BJP leaders and workers of Shimla, a protest was held in Shimla on Thursday during which the effigy of Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi was also burnt.Ramvir Bhatti said that cavalcade of Prime Minister Narendra Modi was stopped in Punjab under a well hatched conspiracy of Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra while Punjab chief minister got scared of the popularity of Prime Minister. He said that for the first time, security lapse has occurred during the movement of a Prime Minister and this was lapse directly on the part of Punjab government. He said it is the responsibility of a state government to provide security to the PM and Punjab government has failed in it||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/shimla/newly-elected-chandigarh-councillors-demand-president-rule-in-punjab/articleshow/88744208.cms||---
---||Shimla||HP Cong MLAs divided over PM Modi’s security breach||Shimla: On the issue of security breach during the movement of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Punjab on Wednesday, politics within Congress has intensified in Himachal Pradesh as the MLAs belonging to rival factions have drawn daggers against each other. Congress MLA Vikramaditya Singh, son of former chief minister late Virbhadra Singh, has demanded that the Punjab government should probe the incident and fix the responsibility of officials responsible for lapses. But Una MLA of Congress, Satpal Singh Raizada has indirectly attacked him by saying that some Congress leaders start questioning the party leadership without applying their mind.Vikramaditya had posted in the social media about the incident by saying that although commenting on the Punjab government is outside his purview, but the developments that have happened on Wednesday are worrying. He said SPG takes care of the inner security circle of the Prime Minister and in whichever state or country he goes, the outer security circle is given by the security agencies of that state and country. He also questioned the argument being given that the Prime Minister had to reach at the venue of programme by helicopter. He said Punjab being a Congress-ruled state, the administration there should have taken more care that there should not be any such lapse in the programme of the Prime Minister so that no one can point a finger. He said now as there is a mistake, action should be taken. “There is no need to look at this development from a political point of view,” he added.In an indirect attack on Vikramditya, Raizada in his social media page posted that today Congress leaders are raising questions on their party and leadership without applying their mind while BJP leaders are abusing Punjab chief minister and Congress president Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.He said Congress workers are fighting the battle of Congress leaders and under such circumstances if one cannot raise his voice against the wrong doings of BJP and cannot stand with party workers, then such leader at least should keep quiet.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/shimla/hp-cong-mlas-divided-over-pm-modis-security-breach/articleshow/88744209.cms||---

---||Srinagar||4 former J&K chief ministers will lose SSG security cover||Srinagar/New Delhi: Four former chief ministers of Jammu and Kashmir, including Farooq Abdullah and Ghulam Nabi Azad, are likely to lose their Special Security Group (SSG) protection as the Union Territory’s administration has decided to “right-size” the elite unit established in 2000, officials said on Thursday.The move comes a little over 19 months after the Centre had issued a gazette notification — Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation (Adaptation of State Laws) Order, 2020 — on March 31, 2020, amending the Special Security Group Act of the erstwhile Jammu and Kashmir government by omitting a clause that provided former chief ministers and their families with SSG security.Officials said the decision was taken by the Security Review Coordination Committee, a group that oversees the threat perception of important leaders in Jammu and Kashmir.The officials said the SSG will be “right-sized” by reducing the number of the elite force to the “bare minimum”. It will be headed by an officer below the rank of Superintendent of Police as against Director, who is of the rank of Inspector General of Police and above.However, the officials feel there was a re-think over the downsizing of the SSG as some experts within the police force feel that this may hamper the preparedness of the elite unit.The SSG will now be entrusted with the security of serving chief ministers and their immediate family members.The decision will entail the withdrawal of the security cover of Farooq Abdullah, Ghulam Nabi Azad and two other former chief ministers Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti at a time when a number of terror incidents have taken place in Srinagar. All these former chief ministers except Azad reside in Srinagar.However, Farooq Abdullah and Azad will continue to be provided the security cover of the National Security Guard, also known as Black cat commandoes, as both of them are Z-plus protectees. Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba will continue to have Z-plus security cover while in Jammu and Kashmir, but are likely to have reduced security outside the union territory.The leaders will be provided security by the district police as well as the security wing based on the threat assessment, the officials said.Some of the SSG personnel would be posted with the security wing of the Jammu and Kashmir Police for “close protection team”, they said. The officials said the remaining SSG personnel are likely to be posted to other wings so that the police force can make the best use of their training and knowledge. Vehicles and other gadgets will be transferred to the security wing of the Jammu and Kashmir Police. pti||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/srinagar/4-former-jk-chief-ministers-will-lose-ssg-security-cover/articleshow/88744211.cms||---

The armed forces can undertake infrastructure development even in ecologically fragile areas which are declared “strategic areas” by the government.PDP president Mehbooba Mufti criticised the government move, saying the allocation of huge tracts of land to armed forces in tourist areas of Jammu and Kashmir confirmed the intention of the Centre to “convert J&K into a military garrison”.According to an order issued in Jammu on 31 December 2021 by the Tourism Department of Jammu and Kashmir, 1,034 kanals (approximately 52 hectares) of land at the famous ski-resort of Gulmarg in Baramulla district and 354 (approximately 18 hectares) kanals in Sonmarg, another popular destination in Ganderbal district, were declared as “strategic areas” for the use of armed forces in the region.The Corps Commander will look over strict adherence to the environment-related laws to prevent any environmental hazard and ensure that no other law applicable in the union territory of J&K is breached, the order said. “Corp Commander shall ensure that the orders, if any, passed by an hon’ble court/tribunal in this regard, are strictly adhered to,” it reads.This was the first notification issued by the administration of the union territory after the amendment to Jammu and Kashmir Development Act 1970 by the Union Home Ministry in October 2020 through an executive order.The Administrative Council headed by the Lieutenant Governor of Jammu and Kashmir gave its nod to the amendment to the Control of Building Operations Act 1988 and the J&K Development Act, 1970 to provide for special dispensation for carrying out construction activities in strategic areas.As per the amendments, the armed forces can undertake infrastructure development even in ecologically fragile areas which are declared as “strategic areas”. pti||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/srinagar/70-hectares-of-land-in-gulmarg-sonamarg-declared-strategic-area/articleshow/88744212.cms||---

District collector S Aneesh Sekhar had announced that people not wearing mask at public and crowded places would be fined, but on Thursday many couldn’t care less and were seen without it at Ulavar Sandhais (farmers markets) in the city.``I have taken both my doses of the vaccine, so I don’t think I will be affected,’’ said Rajathi, a vendor in one of the markets. Social activist V P Manikandan says the government has to create awareness on the fact that vaccines may not give people the required protection in this wave and that they have to maintain distance and wear mask. Thirupathi, a medical shop owner in Anna Nagar, is seen without a mask. He says he has tied a rope in front of his shop which would be enough to protect him and his employees. ``The sale of masks has not increased compared to last month, sometimes people ask for single pieces,’’ he said.Share-autos are public transport vehicles where people are never seen wearing masks. About ten people are packed in them making social distancing impossible. ``It is scary so I have started taking individual Ola taxis,’’ said N Venkadeswari, who used to travel in share autos regularly. Meanwhile, police personnel booked people who were not wearing masks and riding two-wheelers in many parts of the city. In Ramanathapuram district, district collector Shankar Lal Kumawat asked shops and trading centres to ensure that all workers including owners are fully vaccinated and produce certificates whenever inspections are conducted. He also asked shops to avoid using air-conditioner. District collectors of Madurai, Ramanathapuram and Theni inspected bus stands and markets and distributed masks to people found not wearing them.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/despite-intensified-norms-mask-compliance-nil-at-many-places/articleshow/88744219.cms||---

The court was hearing the petition filed by the girl’s mother. The man had a physical relationship with the petitioner’s minor daughter as a result of which she conceived. The Madurai district police had registered a case under sections of the Pocso Act. Since the petitioner’s daughter was presently in her sixth month pregnancy, the petitioner took her to a government hospital for termination of pregnancy. Since the pregnancy is more than 20 weeks, the order of court is required to terminate it. Hence, the petitioner filed this present petition. Justice G R Swaminathan said that as per medical opinion the pregnancy has to be terminated and that it will not cause any risk to the life of the petitioner’s daughter. The judge also interacted with the girl through video call to know her stand. The girl categorically stated that she does not want to continue pregnancy and the petition was filed with her knowledge and consent. Hence, the judge directed the medical experts to take appropriate steps to terminate the pregnancy. Observing that the matter cannot rest there, Justice Swaminathan said that the allegation was that the person responsible for the minor’s pregnancy is a driver of a mini bus in which she was commuting daily. The allegations by the prosecution are fairly serious. The judge directed the police to file a final report in this case within two months. If the forensic report confirms the paternity of the accused, then the jurisdictional court shall take immediate cognizance of the offences and try the case on merits and conclude it within a period of three months, thereafter, said the judge.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/hc-allows-pregnancy-termination-of-minor/articleshow/88744222.cms||---

The contraband, hidden in her clothes, is valued at about Rs 30 lakh in India. She was handed over to the police and booked under the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS). Subsequently, she was remanded to a 14-day judicial custody in Lakhimpur jail. A resident of Kanchanpur district in Nepal, the young woman had entered India via the Gaurifanta border where she was caught with the charas. A first-time offender, she told police that she was offered Rs 15,000 for crossing the border with the drugs. She thought that with the money she would be able to help her family. Ashwini Vishwakarma, SHO of Gaurifanta, said they learnt that the supplier told her she would have to cross the border and once in India, someone would come and take charge of the drugs. A senior police officer told TOI, “There are people across the border who lure unemployed youth into smuggling drugs by offering them quick money. The price of charas increases by at least four times once it crosses the border. However, the actual people behind the drug trade are rarely caught.” Police said several nationals from Nepal are lodged in UP jails for drug smuggling. Most of them were offered between Rs 5,000 and Rs 10,000 per kilogram for smuggling the narcotics into India.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/girl-student-19-from-nepal-caught-with-6kg-charas-on-border/articleshow/88744225.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

He said a proposal in this regard was being finalised and deliberations on it were held at the meeting of the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) on Wednesday. The state forest department had first spotted a tiger through camera traps in Kaimur wildlife sanctuary on March 26, 2020. “Union forests ministry is finalising the works for declaring the second tiger reserve in Bihar in Kaimur. Discussions in this regard were held at the 19th meeting of NTCA chaired by union forests minister Bhupendra Yadav in New Delhi on Wednesday. After Valmiki Tiger Reserve (VTR), Bihar will soon get the second tiger reserve in Kaimur,” Choubey said. Earlier, a big male tiger was spotted through camera traps in Kaimur wildlife sanctuary of Rohtas forest division on March 26, 2020. Forests department officials had found evidences of arrival of the tiger to Kaimur wildlife sanctuary from Sanjay Dhubri-Panna Tiger reserves in Madhya Pradesh. Choubey, who is also the MP from Buxar parliamentary constituency, said locals in Kaimur have told him about tiger-sighting in the past as well. “Other wild animals and migratory birds are also found in Kaimur wildlife sanctuary. A tiger reserve in Kaimur will be good for promotion of tourism in Shahabad region,” the minister said. He added, “The ministry is working on a multi-dimensional approach for conservation of tigers in the country. There are 51 tiger reserves in the country and steps are being taken to bring more places in the tiger conservation network.” Till now, tiger spotting in Bihar has been confined to either VTR in West Champaran or Patna zoo. VTR, the lone tiger reserve in Bihar, has a good number of 31 tigers as per the last tiger census.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/states-second-tiger-reserve-in-kaimur-soon-union-minister/articleshow/88744230.cms||Piyush Tripathi

According to a bulletin issued by the Patna Meteorological Centre on Thursday, isolated areas in the state’s western parts are likely to witness light rain on Friday and Sunday, and the southern parts on Monday. “On Friday, drizzles are expected in one or two locations in western parts of the state,” said Aarti Gupta, a Met official. The rainfall has been attributed to a western disturbance that is expected to affect weather conditions beginning Friday in the western Himalayas. Around this time of the year, western disturbances typically bring rain or snow to the upper Himalayas and rainfall to the northern plains, including Bihar. Meanwhile, a brief reprieve from the biting cold occurred on Thursday, when the sun emerged from the fog cover after a day. As a result, the maximum temperature in a few locations increased. For example, Patna’s maximum temperature rose from 15.6 degrees Celsius on Wednesday to 20.8 degrees C on Thursday. On Thursday, the state’s average maximum temperature was between 18 and 20 degrees C, while the minimum temperature was between 10 and 12 degrees C. In the morning, Chhapra was the coldest place in the state, with a minimum temperature of 8.6 degrees C. On the other hand, the lowest maximum temperature was recorded at Buxar, at 14.9 degrees C. “Over the next three days, temperatures are likely to rise by two to four degrees C,” Gupta said. Besides, fog of moderate to dense intensity continues to prevail in the majority of locations in the morning.  The IMD issued a weather bulletin on Thursday indicating that dense fog is likely to prevail in Bihar over the next two days.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/light-rain-likely-in-parts-of-state-from-today-met/articleshow/88744231.cms||---
---||Patna||Bihar Universities engaged in finalising annual budgets||PATNA: Universities in Bihar are busy these days finalizing their annual budgets for the next financial year (2022-23) and getting them passed by their respective senates, so that the same may be submitted to the state government, before its budget session. But, do these budgets passed by the senate hold any significance for maintaining university’s financial health and ensuring their smooth functioning? Senior academics feel that preparation of annual budgets by state universities has been reduced to a farcical exercise. Budgets are submitted to the state education department quite late and, hence, they are seldom considered by the government. The department invariably sanctions ad-hoc grants to the universities only for meeting their financial requirements for pay and pension of teachers and non-teaching employees.  The practice of sanctioning statutory grants to the universities for meeting their contingent expenses has been discontinued for the last one decade. The university authorities, it seems, have scant regard for the statutory provisions. The Bihar State Universities Act-1976 and Patna University Act-1976 as amended up to date, clearly state that the senate shall meet twice a year on dates to be fixed by the vice-chancellor. One of these meetings would be the annual meeting of the senate in which the budget of the university for the next financial year shall be passed. The VC may convene, whenever he thinks fit, a special third meeting of the senate in a year. There are 13 conventional universities in the state. However, no university in the state conducts more than one meeting of the senate in a year and that, too, primarily to pass its annual budget. And, even that meeting proves to be meaningless as by the time the senate approves the budget, the annual budget of the state is already finalized. State education department officials admit that due to delay in submission of their budget estimates on time, the universities are given ad-hoc grants for their sustenance. “This naturally results in delayed payment of salaries to the teachers and non-teaching staff of the universities,” said an official. Due to irregular release of grants by the government, the universities also fail to submit the utilization certificates on time. Teachers and non-teaching staff of different universities do not receive their salaries for three to four months as the universities do not submit utilization certificates on time. Working president of the Federation of University Teachers’ Associations of Bihar, Kanhaiya Bahadur Sinha, said ad-hocism rules the roost in the state universities. Till 1982-83, the universities used to submit their annual budgets to the government well in time and, in turn, the government used to sanction item-wise grants to the universities. But, now lump sum grants are given to the universities every year, giving the universities some leverage to act arbitrarily and misuse funds, he said. Patna University Teachers’ Association general secretary Abhay Kumar said, “The universities must pass their annual budgets in time and the state education department should also sanction grants to the universities as per their requirements. Moreover, salary grants must be released by the government in time so that teachers and non-teaching staff do not face any hardship,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/univs-engaged-in-finalising-annual-budgets/articleshow/88744232.cms||---

Justice Ch Manavendranath Roy passed orders after hearing the petitions filed by Thummala Gangi Reddy and T Umashankar Reddy challenging the orders given by Kadapa chief judicial magistrate allowing the CBI petition to turn Shaik Dastagiri as approver in the case. CBI arrested Gangi Reddy, Umashankar Reddy and Dastagiri as accused in the Vivekananda Reddy murder case. A preliminary charge sheet has also been filed in the case. Even as the investigation going, the CBI filed an application before the court as Dastagiri came forward to turn approver in the case. Contending the court’s decision to allow Dastagiri to turn approver, Umashankar Reddy and Gangi Reddy moved the high court. Senior counsels B Adinarayana Rao and T Niranjan Reddy argued that the courts should allow the accused to turn approver only when there is no evidence available. In the present case, the CBI is not depending on Dastagiri statement alone and it is relying on many other evidences. They have argued that once the statement under 164 CrPC was recorded, he cannot be allowed to turn approver by recording his statement again under 306(4)(a) of CrPC. They have further said that Dastagiri was nowhere in picture when the case was investigated by the state police and later by a special investigation team (SIT). CBI counsel A Chennakeshavulu sought time to submit the details sought by the high court. He said the CBI has followed due procedure in the case. The high court posted the matter for further hearing to January 20.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/viveka-murder-cbi-told-to-submit-prelim-charge-sheet-statements/articleshow/88741536.cms||Srikanth Aluri
---||Lucknow||VIP seeks online applications from aspiring UP candidates||Lucknow: Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) has sought online applications from candidates willing to contest the upcoming Vidhan Sabha elections in UP. Those interest can apply on the website of the party. The applications will be scanned to sort out ‘talented’ candidates. The selection will be finalized by national president of the party Mukesh Sahni, a minister in the Bihar government. There are broad parameters on which the candidates will be judged, the foremost being that one should not be ‘daagi’ (tainted) but ‘talented’ to win the elections. While doing away with tainted ones would be easy, how the party will gauge the talent of the candidate is yet to be defined, especially for the ones who have not been in public life or taken up leadership posts. National spokesperson of the party Dev Jyoti said that the party website has received close to 61 applications so far since December 27 when it opened. “By talent, we mean the candidate’s ability to win over people, which can translate into votes for the party,” said Jyoti. Education is not a priority. Applications are open to the unlettered ones also, he added. The party, which will contest 165 seats in Nishad-dominated districts of Purvanchal, Bundelkhand—the land of late Nishad leader Phoolan Devi—and a few districts in Awadh, will continue to receive applications till nominations for the last phase are filed. In that case, the party is hopeful that it will get disgruntled candidates who fail to get a ticket from parties like BJP and Nishad party. VIP will make its debut in UP politics in 2022 Assembly elections. Its fight is for Nishad reservation in UP. In June, it opened a party office in Lucknow and appointed office-bearers. On Phoolan Devi’s death anniversary, it tried to install her statues in 18 divisional headquarters of UP but failed. It has also distributed 50,000 busts of Phoolan Devi and held Nishad Janchetna rallies.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/vip-seeks-online-applications-from-aspiring-up-candidates/articleshow/88743279.cms||Neha Shukla

I will be there for the Muslims of Margao. I will not allow injustice to be done on poor and weaker sections of the society. I will take up all of the issues of Margao with the government,” Ajgaonkar told reporters after visiting Margao Municipal Council councillor, Mahesh Amonkar, who is on a protest fast outside the office of the South Goa Planning and Development Authority (SGPDA) over the change of zone of the land acquired for kabrastan at Sonsoddo, Margao. Ajgaonkar demanded that an inquiry into the matter. In a dig at Margao MLA Digambar Kamat, Ajgaonkar said, “Politicians have only used Muslims in Margao for votes, even getting elected multiple times over the issue of kabrastan which is pending for the last over 40 years. If Muslims in Pernem can get a burial ground, why can’t Margao?” Sources in BJP, however, said that no decision has been made on the party candidature from Margao yet, though a couple of names were being seriously considered. Jagannath ‘Desh’ Prabhudessai, whose candidature was finalised by the party pending approval from its central leadership, quit last week citing factionalism within the party.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/ready-to-contest-from-margao-ajgaonkar/articleshow/88742816.cms||---
---||Delhi||Bulli Bai app case: How BTech student from Assam lost his way||NEW DELHI: What prompted a young, bright computer science student to create an application that put Muslim women, journalists in the main, up for auction online? This is a questions to which the cops will seek an answer in the one week they have remand of Niraj Bishnoi, arrested for creating the controversial Bulli Bai app. Bishnoi has supposedly claimed during initial questioning that he was outraged with the political stand and reportage of some of the journalists and so wanted to teach them a lesson. However, police said that more interrogation was required to ascertain the real motive behind Bishnoi’s act. His bank accounts are also being examined. What has baffled the investigators is the tactics Bishnoi apparently used to obscure his tracks on the internet, allowing him to elude police for almost a week. The GitHub account was created and accessed using Proton virtual private network and a Proton email address. Bishnoi had located the VPN in Japan and USA to mislead the cops into believing the user was based in those countries. He had also taken several other measures to mask his IP address. During initial interrogation, Bishnoi claimed to have copied the Sulli Deals' repository and edited the code and graphics to make a similar app. Cops are, however, verifying each claim and will corroborate it with forensic reports of his devices and online activity. "During interrogation, he disclosed that he created the Bulli Bai app on GitHub apart from the twitter handle @bullibai_ and some other handles,” revealed KPS Malhotra, DCP (Special Cell). “He further disclosed that the GitHub account and the app were developed in November 2021 and updated in December 2021 before release." Sources said that the @bullibai_ twitter account was also created by Bishnoi using the Proton VPN and Proton email address on December 31. He also created another twitter account, @Sage0x1, for tweeting information about the app and propagating it. He also admitted to operating the account of the woman arrested by Mumbai Police. Son of a trader in Jorhat, Assam, Bishnoi lived with parents and two sisters in Rajasthan before relocating to Assam several years ago. “Niraj is the only son and youngest in the family. He was a shy boy who mostly kept to himself. We are wondering what led him to do this, if at all,” said an incredulous relative. Tech savvy as he was, Bishnoi's world pretty much revolved around his laptop and smartphone. The cops are conducting a thorough analysis of his devices to get a better perspective about him. Till now, the probe indicates that Bishnoi was impulsive. In the last week, he was continuously monitoring the news on social media and when Mumbai Police arrested some people who allegedly propagated the Bulli Bai app on Twitter, Bishnoi actually came forward through an anonymous account, (@giyu44), and claimed responsibility. He then blaming the Mumbai cops of having framed innocent people. Even then, he was careful and tried to mislead the police by switching on the location feature of Twitter and setting the user location in Nepal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/virtual-harassment-how-student-lost-his-way/articleshow/88742860.cms||Raj Shekhar

No laxity should occur in maintenance of security to the PM. As per the protocol, the Punjab government should have maintained the PM’s security,” Nitish said, adding an inquiry should be conducted to identify those responsible for lapses in PM’s security. “Strong action should be taken against those responsible for the lapse so that such incidents are not repeated in future,” he added. The Bihar BJP functionaries have also blamed the Punjab government for the security lapse during PM Modi’s visit. “The lapse in the PM’s security was the result of low and mean politics of the Congress. It was on the instigation of its political masters in Delhi that the Punjab government maintained laxity in providing security to the PM,” former Bihar deputy CM and Rajya Sabha member tweeted. Bihar BJP president Dr Sanjay Jaiswal said the security lapse was an attempt to get the PM killed in “mob attack”. He said the chief secretary and DGP of Punjab gave false information that the route was clear.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/pms-security-breachnitish-calls-for-action/articleshow/88744233.cms||Abhay Singh
---||India||Lok Sabha election spend cap raised to Rs 95 lakh, state polls’ to Rs 40 lakh||NEW DELHI: The maximum poll expenditure limit for candidates has been hiked to Rs 95 lakh from Rs 70 lakh for Lok Sabha elections and to Rs 40 lakh from Rs 28 lakh for assembly elections, as per a decision taken by the law ministry on the recommendation of the Election Commission. The new expenditure limits for assembly polls, revised in view of the rise in cost inflation index and the size of the electorate between the last major revision in 2014 and 2021, will be applicable to the upcoming elections in UP, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Goa and Manipur, likely to be announced any day now. A senior EC functionary said the new expenditure limits, which were last revised around seven years ago, will help the candidates meet the higher expenses on digital and mass-media campaigns in view of stricter curbs on physical rallies due to Covid as well as the additional spend on Covid safety material like sanitisers and masks. It be recalled that EC had, taking into account the increased candidates’ expenditure due to Covid, made an ad-hoc hike of 10% in the spending limit for polls held during the pandemic. While the Lok Sabha poll expenditure limit for bigger states, which was Rs 70 lakh as per last revision done in 2014, has been raised by 35% to Rs 95 lakh, in the smaller states, where the limit was Rs 54 lakh, it stands revised 38% upwards to Rs 75 lakh. For assembly elections, the revised poll expenditure limit for candidates will now be Rs 40 lakh for the big states, up 42% from Rs 28 lakh, while candidates in smaller states can now spend a maximum of Rs 28 lakh, 40% higher than the previous limit of Rs 20 lakh. EC had set up a committee in 2020 to review the expenditure limits in view of the 12.23% rise in cost inflation index from 240 in 2014-15 to 317 in 2021-22 and 32% increase in the number of electors from 834 million in 2014 to 936 million in 2021. The committee — which comprised retired IRS officer Harish Kumar, EC secretary general Umesh Sinha and senior deputy election commissioner Chandra Bhushan Kumar — heard political parties, chief electoral officers and election observers before making its recommendations that were accepted by EC.

He should take a bold decision,” party’s state president Jagadanand Singh told mediapersons here. He advised Nitish to take “bold steps” and remove those ministers from his cabinet who oppose his policies. Singh added leader of opposition in state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav wants to be with the CM in matters related to betterment of people in the state. “Caste-based census will help formulation of policies for the benefit of the poor and suppressed sections of the society,” Singh said. “In any government, a CM has the right to take decisions. Nitish should remove those ministers who oppose his policies,” he added. Singh also reminded Nitish of the controversial DNA statement which PM Narendra Modi had made during the 2015 assembly election in Bihar. “No one can dare to do the DNA test of people of Bihar. Since Independence, whenever people of this state wanted, they succeeded overthrowing the government in the country,” Singh said. He added the RJD would also support government on steps being taken to tackle Covid pandemic in the state. “The government, however, should ensure that the poor and daily-wage workers do not face trouble,” he said. Senior JD(U) functionary K C Tyagi said the special status for Bihar and caste-based census in the country were not the issues of a particular party. “The CM has been raising these issues for long. As far as special status is concerned, it is related to the pride and prestige of Bihar and I am happy that RJD is also supporting it,” Tyagi said. “Just giving grants to Bihar is not enough. Nobody will set up industrial units in Madhepura or Saharsa, leaving Chennai or Ahmadabad, if s/he is not given any incentive,” Tyagi said. Meanwhile, the BJP has downplayed the statement of the RJD state president. BJP’s OBC morcha national general secretary Nikhil Anand said the RJD functionaries were daydreaming. He also reminded the RJD of how Nitish had parted ways with them after forming the government in 2015. “The RJD is desperate to come to power in the state. They should first play the role of a good opposition,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/take-bold-decision-on-castecensus-spl-status-rjd-to-cm/articleshow/88744235.cms||Sheezan Nezami

Hence, RPF personnel have been deployed there to conduct a vigorous awareness drive and ensure that everyone wears masks.“The RPF men are assisting elderly passengers in safely entering the station premises and platform areas to board trains. They are also making announcements on megaphones reminding everyone to follow social distancing norms and coordinating with health workers to conduct round-the-clock Covid testing,” the CPRO told this reporter, adding that the railways had provided adequate space near gate number 3 at the Patna Junction for the state health department to conduct tests on passengers.Covid testing booths have also been established at the Ara Junction, Buxar station, Muzaffarpur Junction, Begusarai station, and Darbhanga Junction.

Many of them have cancelled and rescheduled their bookings, while others have decided to host small ceremonies at home in the presence of family members. Sheetal Kumari, an Ashiana Colony resident, told this reporter, “I was supposed to marry on January 19, but we have decided to postpone the wedding and set new dates.” The 26-year-old expressed her desire for a grand wedding, which is currently prohibited. Unlike Sheetal’s family, Rafiah’s has chosen a small wedding in a hotel. “We cancelled our reservation at a community hall shortly after the restrictions were announced. We have now reserved a small hall in a hotel on Fraser Road for the ceremony, which will be attended by family members and a few close relatives,” claimed Rafiah, a Naya Tola resident. Anand Mishra, whose daughter is getting married on January 20, has ceased sending invitations to relatives and friends. He said, “Selecting only 40 guests was a difficult task, so I decided to get my daughter married in the presence of family members at home. I will throw a party for relatives and friends later when the situation improves.” Meanwhile, hotel and banquet hall owners are facing massive losses as a result of cancellations, budget cuts, and postponements. A Nair, the general manager of a hotel on Beerchand Patel Path, rued, “We are receiving more requests to reschedule weddings. This has had an effect on business.” B D Singh, the general manager of another hotel, said, “While some people have complied with the government’s directive and reduced their guest list, others have cancelled their bookings. Apart from weddings and engagements, a number of functions and seminars have also been postponed. Although business had recently improved, we are once again facing a loss.” Sanjeev Suman, the manager of a marriage lawn on Saguna Mor, pointed out that they had received 11 cancellations thus far due to people opting for smaller weddings. “Every time the government declares fresh restrictions, we are forced to bear the brunt of the consequences. The banquet business has been in terrible shape for the last year and a half,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/marriage-not-on-the-cards-for-many-amid-new-curbs/articleshow/88744239.cms||Faryal Rumi

A delegation of the Samiti led by its convener Pt Ravindra Sharma handed over a memorandum to the representative of the district magistrate, Kanpur Nagar about their demand.

Further, it was evident that the police did not register any FIR first, and if the report was registered then submit its final report. And moreover, the police did not conduct a fair investigation. Matter of Ashiq Ali’s advocate was evidence of such activities. The court itself had rejected the final report submitted by the police. Ashiq Ali disappeared a couple of years ago when he was returning to his home from court. The police had failed to trace the body of the advocate or any other detail. Citing the murder of Raja Ram, Sharma submitted that CBI inquiry of both matters would reveal the truth, therefore, the state should order to conduct the CBI inquiry.

After 13 years and two stone layings, the Improvement Trust will at last build these flats over 8.8 acres near the Pakhowal road.The applicants can check their names on a list that the LIT has put on its website. The LIT claims that the HIG (high-income group) flats had received a better response than the MIG (middle-income group) flats and the draw will be conducted under the Covid protocol, which has been conveyed to the applicants. Of the 576 flats, 336 are HIG and 240 MIG. The HIG flats have 770 applicants under the general category and 66 under the other categories such as freedom fighters and their widows and children, defence personnel, Border Security Force (BSF), Central Reserve Police Force, riot-affected people, and government employees. The MIG flats have 151 applicants under the general category and 14 under the other categories. One of the LIT officials claimed that considering several requests, the application deadline had been moved to December 27, 2021, and since that had lapsed, the draw of lots will be on January 10. The public can refer to the online list. The project includes community centre, medicine shops, and gym. After the allotment, the project will take three years to complete. There will be a multi-storey parking lot for 225 cars. Contacted about the project, LIT chairman Raman Balasubramanium said: "For the sake of transparency, we will call random applicants to draw the chits. If there are fewer applications in the MIG category than the number of flats, then the LIT will offer those houses to those who missed out in the HIG category, and hold another draw of lots for them on the spot." Claiming that the project was reliable and the trust will deliver it in a fixed time, he mentioned that even his son was among the applicants. The draw of lots will be at Nehru Sidhant Kendra. The LIT selected this venue because of the Covid situation, as it has enough space to seat the applicants fair distance apart. The applicants are required to wear masks. The Atal Apartments scheme has been hanging fire since 2008. Its foundation stone was laid twice, first in 2011 by the-then local bodies minister Tikshan Sood and the second time on December 16, 2021, by chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/draw-of-lots-for-atal-apartments-on-jan-10/articleshow/88744256.cms||---

He wants officials told to fill these gaps in the fencing. He also proposed to add some extra mesh to the top of the fence to prevent any tossing of the garbage over it at night when the panel’s alertness levels are down. For this addition, he proposed inviting corporate houses and NGOs to adopt various sections based on individual financial capacity.The fence has established the drain’s boundary after an anti-encroachment action freed a 14-kilometre-long and 20-metre-wide corridor where an 11-megawatt solar-energy plant can be set up under a separate project. As water must be treated before being released into the drain, it requires oxygenating it by tossing into the air with the help a longitudinal network of floating fountains that will pump this water upward for aeration. This system could be powered by solar energy or regular electricity. This will further reduce pollution by spray aeration before the treated water drains into the Satluj river. Contacted about this plan, MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal said: "I will go through the suggestions and in case I found these ideas to be practical, I will get these implemented."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/buddha-nullah-panel-member-points-out-gaps-in-fencing-work-to-mc-chief/articleshow/88744257.cms||---

Describing the objections, Harvinder Singh of the Ghanta Ghar Wholesale Shoe Market Association said: "GST on any footwear, including shoes, chappals, and sandals, priced below Rs 1,000 has been hiked to 12%. This is the biggest setback ever to our trade, since the tax rate has more than doubled, the consequences of which will be disastrous for both the traders was well as the manufacturers. Our cost of doing business will increase and the sales will drop because of the increased selling price."Footwear trader Surinder Singh said: "What has upset us the most is that when last year the notification was issued by the taxation authorities about the increase in the GST rates, footwear was put in the 5% tax slab with textile and garment products but the new rate of 12% was slapped selectively on the footwear sector alone. We have nothing against the textile and garment sector but we dislike mistreatment our industry, which has thousands of micro and small-level businessmen."The sector of the industry wants the government to restore the GST rate to 5%. Shoe trader Ramandeep Singh said: "The increase of 7% GST will hit our businesses hard, as the rate of all kinds of shoes and allied products that earlier were in the 5% slab will increase significantly, forcing the consumers to curtail their purchases. We request the central government to reconsider its decision and roll back the hike in GST on footwear."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/footwear-traders-oppose-gst-hike-seek-rollback/articleshow/88744259.cms||Mohit Behl
---||Goa||Taxi drivers say tourists charged on hourly or daily basis||Panaji: After TOI reported about instances of taxi operators fleecing commuters during New Year’s Eve, taxi union representatives have come forward with another side to the story, claiming that they charged tourists as per the hourly or daily service, and not for a single trip. “No one has been charged Rs 2,000 for 3km unless the taxi services were hired for the entire day. Tourists have a tendency to avail of the taxi based on kilometres, but when the New Year’s Eve traffic congestion is taken into consideration particularly in the Calangute-Baga-Arpora area, it takes hours to manoeuver through the sea of people. Such things are taken into account during charging,” said taxi union leader Laximan ‘Bappa’ Korgaonkar. He further said that slight increase in prices for various tourist related services are a common feature during the New Year’s Eve. “The rates of transport, whether they are flights or hospitality services, tend to see a sudden spike on New Year’s Eve. Even restaurants quote skyrocketing prices for their items irrespective of the menu. In the face of such instances, some drivers have a tendency to enhance their rates by a few hundred rupees,” he said. Transport minister Mauvin Godinho had told TOI that he was informed of the incidents and accordingly, instructed the directorate of transport to initiate action against the offenders. However, officials from the transport department said that they have yet to receive such complaints in writing from afflicted tourists. “Even if tourists cannot come to the transport head office, there are other platforms like email or RTOs that they can approach. We have checked social media to see if anyone has reported instances of fleecing, however, there have been no posts yet,” a transport officer told TOI. TOI had reported on January 4 that taxi drivers outside a resort quoted Rs 2,000 for a one-way trip. The cost amounted to more than Rs 600 per km.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/taxi-drivers-say-tourists-charged-on-hourly-or-daily-basis/articleshow/88742886.cms||---
---||Goa||ST forums demand seat reservations for polls||Margao/Canacona: The Goa Scheduled Tribes Action Committee (GSSTAC) has written to chief minister Pramod Sawant urging his intervention over its demand for reservation of seats for ST members in the state legislative assembly. Manuel Barbosa, secretary of the Committee, in his letter to the chief minister, pointed out to the order of the high court of Bombay at Goa passed in 2013 while disposing a writ petition filed by the Committee in 2007, directing the Election Commission of India to ensure proportional representation to the scheduled tribes under the provisions of Articles 332, 330 and 342D of the Constitution of India. Meanwhile, the Gawada, Kunbi, Velip and Dhangar (Gakuved) Federation, which has sought reservation in four to five seats as per the ST population in the respective constituency, has threatened to work against the BJP if their long-pending demand for reservation is not considered. The GSSTAC and Gakuved federation have jointly appealed to the state government to declare the reservation for the coming assembly elections. The GSSTAC, in the letter, also pointed out that it had submitted a representation in that regard to the Delimitation Commission of India when it had officially visited the state around 2004-05. The commission had then pointed out to the requirement of census figures to substantiate their demand, Barreto said, adding that though the ST population in Goa was later recorded as 1,49,275 in the 2011 census, no steps have so far been taken for reserving seats for STs in the state legislative assembly. He said that Article 332 of the Constitution of India mandates reservation of seats based on population. “However, so far, the government has taken no initiative in the matter…Already, elections have been held in Goa in 2007, 2012 and 2017 without giving reservation to the ST population by violating Article 332 of the Constitution of India,” the letter states. The committee has urged the intervention of the chief minister in the matter “to ensure that this intolerable situation comes to an end immediately and that the constitutional provision of reservation of proportional number of seats for STs in the state are reserved without further delay.” The Gakuved has accused the Union government of denying them support to ensure their rights. “The Union and the state governments have opposed the petition in the high court of Bombay at Goa seeking reservations for STs in the upcoming polls. It appears that the BJP government, both at the Centre and in Goa, are not in favour of giving tribal communities their constitutional rights,” secretary of the federation, Rupesh Velip, said. President of the federation Suresh Palkar said that even after granting Gawdas, Velips and Kunbis ST status in 2003, the community has been deprived of political reservations. The delimitation commission failed to reserve seats for STs and the BJP, after forming government in 2014, allowed an ordinance issued by the Centre in 2013 to lapse, he alleged.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/st-forums-demand-seat-reservations-for-polls/articleshow/88742822.cms||TNN

These labs fear they may not be able to accept samples if the demand keeps rising at the current pace. “We are working two-three shifts to process the samples being received. I wish we could do more, but that’s not practically possible,” said Dr Navin Dang, microbiologist and founder of Dr Dang’s Lab, adding that demand for Covid testing had gone up five times in the past month. According to Dr Arvind Lal, executive chairman, Dr Lal Path Lab, Covid tests in Delhi had risen from around 1,400 daily in Delhi till about a month ago to 7,000 in his labs. “Our capacity is 10,000 to 15,000,” he added]. In a similar vein, Dr Vishal Wadhwa of Metropolis Healthcare Ltd, another leading chain of path labs, said they conducted an average of 600 Covid tests daily in Delhi in December but “between January 1 and January 5, we carried out 7,153 tests, averaging 1,430 tests daily. Our total capacity is around 5,000 tests daily,” Wadhwa said. During the second Covid wave last year, demand for Covid tests rose so dramatically that many labs had to hire additional manpower. Once the demand fell, some of the staff were let go. Now, the labs are facing a manpower crunch again. Also, sources said, infection among the staff members can reach crisis levels like last year. “With the sudden surge in demand, labs are finding it hard to cope with the extra pressure and test reports are being given in 24 to 36 hours,” noted Dr Shuchin Bajaj, founder director, Ujala Cygnus Group of Hospitals. He said it could be wiser to rationalise who needed a Covid test and who didn’t. “Since there is a full community spread now, we should not be focusing on tests for asymptomatic contacts or asymptomatic people or for travel purposes. Tests should be available to symptomatic people on demand,” Dr Bajaj said, adding that reports were getting delayed due to pressure on labs and this was likely to increase further in the days to come. Many people are also buying self-test kits from the chemists and testing themselves at home. Dr Arun Gupta, president, Delhi Medical Council, said these kits were rapid antigen tests and their detection sensitivity was much lower than that of the standard RT-PCR tests. “Symptomatic patients should ideally undergo RT-PCR tests and not rely on the self-test kits,” he advised.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/testing-infra-starts-creaking-as-pressure-rises/articleshow/88742277.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath also distributed tool kits to 75,000 artisans who did training under the Vishwakarma Shram Samman Yojana, and to 10,000 craftspersons under One District-One Product scheme. Sharing the efforts of the government to ensure that traditional crafts prospered, especially during Covid-19 lockdown, the CM said that saving lives and livelihoods and ensuring jobs for the 40 lakh migrant workers who returned to the state was a huge challenge. “MSME units did a commendable job by providing employment in the state. This is a continuous campaign and if a person’s skills can be linked with employment, then the society becomes self-sufficient. This is a major factor in the progress of UP in the last five years,” the CM said. Congratulating the beneficiaries of the schemes, Yogi said when even a single person gets job, he/she becomes a means of livelihood for entire family and helps it in becoming self-reliant. He said Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme, financial assistance provided under ODOP, Mukhyamantri Yuva Swarozgar Yojana, Vishwakarma Shram Samman Yojana, Mudra Yojana and other schemes had provided a new direction to many. Crediting women for participating in the self-employment programmes, he said: “Training is being given to 75,000 women across the state. The government is providing interest free loans to 25,000 of them under the Pradhan Mantri Shram Yojana. If these women become financially independent, society will be empowered.” Additional chief secretary, MSME, Navneet Sehgal said a revcent survey showedthat 27 lakh people have got employment in 11 lakh MSME units. The government provided loans to 95.49 lakh units and 3 crore youth were hired.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/govt-gives-rs-4k-cr-loans-to-over-5l-msme-units/articleshow/88743281.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||Dehradun||Corbett scam: Take action against offenders, says Uttarakhand high court||NAINITAL: Hearing a petition filed against the illegal constructions carried out in Morghatti and Pakhro areas of Corbett Tiger Reserve (CTR), Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Thursday ordered chief secretary SS Sandhu and principal secretary (environment), Anand Bardhan, to take action against the offenders. The division bench of acting Chief Justice Sajjan Kumar Mishra and Justice Alok Kumar Verma also asked the officials to submit an action taken report in the court by February 14, when the case will next be heard. Separate investigations by teams of the National Tiger Conservation Authority and the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change have already confirmed that constructions were carried out in Morghatti and Pakhro areas of Kalagarh in violation of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, and Indian Forest Act, 1972. The state government had in November last year ordered transfers of 30 Indian Forest Service (IFS) officers -- including senior officials like the head of forest force and chief wildlife warden. Many of the transfers were said to have been done over the alleged illegalities in CTR. Reacting to the transfers, the bench on Thursday asked the state on what basis were the transfers done. Earlier in the day, the HC had clubbed a petition filed by Dehradun-resident Anu Pant and the one that was filed after the HC took suo motu cognisance of a TOI report (published on October 23, 2021) that detailed how the construction of concrete structures and felling of trees took place in sensitive areas of the Corbett reserve, which has the world’s highest tiger density, without due sanctions. Incidentally, the HC order comes a day after the Union environment ministry had written to its regional office in Dehradun, asking for legal action to be taken against the officials responsible for the illegal construction in CTR.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/corbett-scam-take-action-against-offenders-submit-report-by-feb-14-orders-hc/articleshow/88739847.cms||Sonali Mishra

Some changes may bring respite from traffic jams,” he said. Commuters said that they want the authorities to implement the regulations to prevent traffic chaos in the area.Akhay Lale, who frequently passes through the area, said, “Earlier, we used face traffic jams on Pune-Solapur road. However, now all roads in Hadapsar face traffic-related issues. The internal roads are not wide enough to cater to the increasing traffic. Hence, some monitoring is essential. The traffic has increased due to newly developed residential areas around Hadapsar,” he added.Local activist Ganesh Bhosale said, “After receiving regular complaints from locals about traffic snarls, we decided to approach the traffic department to plan a joint visit to the spots to review the condition and work out possible solutions. We will hold similar visits in next few days to check if the traffic movement has improved or not. We also have suggested clearing of encroachments along the roads,” Bhosale added.According to commuters, the congestion points are Sasanenagar road, Kaleborate nagar railway gate crossing, Navnath chowk and approach roads towards the railway gate.The authorities from the traffic department said, “We are seeking feedback from local citizens, shopkeepers. Additional manpower will be deployed at the chronic spots. We will also approach the civic administration for installation of traffic signals as per requirements at some locations,” an official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/corporators-cops-pitch-in-to-unclog-road-stretches/articleshow/88744265.cms||---

---||Pune||Writer documents culinary culture of Maha families||Pune: When author Sudha Menon lost her mother-in-law (of the Chandraseniya Kayastha Prabhu caste) to dementia in 2016, she realised many of the family’s culinary traditions were lost with her.This, she realised, highlighted a rather common problem – most Indian families have unique culinary traditions and recipes, but often do not document them so that they be passed down to future generations.This prompted the city-based writer to interview Maharashtrian families about recipes passed down orally through generations and compile these sentimental, indigenous recipes in a book titled ‘Recipes for Life: Well-Known Personalities Reveal Stories, Memories and Age-old Family Recipes’.In a chat with TOI, Menon shared excerpts from her book. “Shanta Gokhale, the writer, was nicknamed ‘Chakli’ in school due to her fondness for the festive snack, made by her mother during Ganeshotsav and Diwali. She also talks about her mother’s incomparable chirote and other recipes that she did not have the opportunity to write down before her mother died,” says Menon.In the book, eminent artist Atul Dodiya talks about how his mother from Kalavad completely integrated herself into the Maharashtrian community in a Ghatkopar chawl. “She learnt how to follow rituals such as ‘Shravni Somwar’, when she made ‘upwas’ food; made kheer on his birthdays; and ‘tilgul’ on Sankranti. On weekends, over simple Maharashtrian meals, she would discuss art with him, which encouraged and inspired his career,” adds Menon.She also interviewed and documented culinary culture of the families of cricket commentator Harsha Bhogle, author Manu Pillai, actor Aamir Khan’s sister actor-producer Nikhat Hedge and others from other states.“I did not want gourmet recipes from them, I sought recipes and stories of the food these families would eat on a regular basis. The interviewees talked about how their mothers or mothers-in law made the best ‘aamti’ or ‘usal’ – stuff like that. As a people, food is an integral part of our cultural integrity, and we are losing it without even realising it, as there is no documentation,” says Menon.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/writer-documents-culinary-culture-of-maha-families/articleshow/88744267.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

Even if one wants to go near NIBM Road, one gets stuck in heavy traffic. The hawkers add to the commotion. The link road will certainly help,” said a resident said. Spread over 32sqkm area on the eastern side of the city, Kondhwa is divided into northern and southern parts. Kondhwa Khurd includes areas like NIBM-Mohammadwadi, Kausar Baug, Salunke Vihar, Meetanagar, while Kondhwa Budruk includes localities like Kasatnagar, Sainagar, Tilekarnagar, Kamthenagar, Yevalewadi and others.A Kondhwa Budruk resident said, “Travelling less than 1km takes about 20 minutes here, considering the traffic during the peak hours. Many vehicles travelling to and from Katraj, Bibvewadi and NIBM-Mohammadwadi and Hadapsar take this route. The road will be of huge convenience for residents in the area to bypass traffic on the main road.”Corporator Nanda Lonkar said, “A budget of Rs 1 crore has been sanctioned for the construction of link road.

Madhya Pradesh and Haryana won a gold each.

Similarly, patients suffering from immune-compromised status (HIV, transplant recipients and cancer therapy) shall only be allowed home isolation after proper evaluation by the treating medical officers, the guidelines have stated.The guidelines are applicable to Covid-19 patients who have been clinically assessed and assigned as mild or asymptomatic cases. “Patients with pre-existing diseases or medical conditions need to undergo medical evaluation and will only be allowed home isolation with the doctor or medical officer's permission. The same is also applicable to people on immunosuppressant drugs or therapy,”the guidelines stated.“The revised guidelines for home isolation clarify selection criteria, precautions that need to be followed by such patients and their families, signs that require monitoring and prompt reporting to health facilities,” said Dr Sanjay Patil, chairman of the IMA’s Hospital Board of India, Pune branch.— Umesh Isalkar||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/doctors-nod-must-for-60-with-comorbidities-to-get-home-care/articleshow/88744270.cms||---
---||Pune||Revised norms may boost recovery rate, hope experts||Pune: The Centre’s revised guidelines withdrawing the mandatory Covid testing of asymptomatic contacts and shortening the home isolation of the mildly infected patients from 10 to seven days are likely to reduce the daily caseload and boost recovery rate. Asymptomatic close contacts share around 40% of the total Covid testing across the country. “Testing has two purposes: containment and mitigation. High transmissibility of Omicron challenges containment strategies putting severe stress on contact tracing,” said infectious diseases expert Dr Sanjay Pujari.“The responsibility now lies with the people to show due diligence in following the norms in the home isolation period,” said Dr Pujari, who is also a member of the national Covid task force. The experts observed that fewer testing in South Africa had resulted in a decline in an absolute number of Covid-19 cases, which led to the premature conclusion of decline in the peak. “Reliable data on virus shedding both in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals and in vaccinated versus unvaccinated are still evolving. A combination of pragmatism and precaution in the context of evolving evidence is the best way forward,” Dr Pujari said.Senior community medicine expert Dr Arvind Kushwaha of Nagpur-based All India Institute of Medical Sciences said, “Testing the asymptomatic yields no benefit but definitely raises fear to individuals and society. In the advanced stage of the pandemic, contact tracing loses its value. The effort should be directed towards managing patients needing hospitalization and high-risk individuals.”Dr Sanjeev Wavare, nodal officer for Covid-19 in the Pune municipal limits, said, “About 40% of the total Covid testing belongs to the close contacts. Most of them are asymptomatic. We will now not have to test them. But the guidelines have stressed on scaling up testing to avert supers-spreader events.” He said, “There is a need to reinforce random community-based testing of people who come in contact with a large number of people, like grocers, hawkers, vegetable-fruit vendors and other shop-keepers, on a daily basis. Testing will be scaled up, Reduction in the testing of the asymptomatic people will not immediately lead to a drop in daily caseload. But curtailing the home isolation period will definitely boost the recovery rate.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/revised-norms-may-boost-recovery-rate-hope-experts/articleshow/88744272.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Besides, 1.4 lakh residents from the 45-59 age group are yet to take their first jab.Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, said there was a possibility of few people remaining unvaccinated because of the large floating population, doubling of names and other factors, but the health department did not have the exact data. He said all the health units across Pune, Pimpri Chinchwad and rural areas were working together to make sure all the beneficiaries got their first and second shots at the earliest.Vikas Dhakane, the additional municipal commissioner of Pimpri Chinchwad, told TOI, “We introduced ‘no vaccine no entry’ rule in our last week’s order to make sure the adults who had not taken the first jab or whose second jab was still pending took it at the earliest.”Sanjay Patil, chairman, Indian Medical Association’s Hospital Board of India, said, “Considering the concerns of the rapid spread of the Omicron variant, every unvaccinated person should get vaccinated at the earliest.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/more-than-58k-senior-citizens-yet-to-get-their-first-vax-dose/articleshow/88744273.cms||---

TOI found on Thursday evening that over 100 out of over 300 enlisted hospitals in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) limits were yet to update their bed availability status on the dashboard of the Pune divisional commissioner’s office. Earlier in the day, Manisha Naik, assistant health officer, PMC, told TOI, “We are aware that most of the hospitals have not updated their bed status on the dashboard. We have told them to update it at the earliest. A letter has been sent to them on January 5. If they fail to comply, we shall send our staff members to the respective hospitals for updating the data in their presence.”Naik said the private hospitals were advised earlier this week to admit Covid patients as and when required. The official said the civic body would reserve 80% beds as it did during the previous Covid wave if the cases continued to rise.Vikas Dhakane, additional commissioner, Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC), said, “We know from our experience that the hospitalisation is likely to be low though cases are rising.

---||Pune||Covid case rise pace in Pune far lower than most Maharashtra districts: Data||PUNE: Pune has emerged as one of the few districts in Maharashtra registering a relatively slower increase in Covid-19 cases in comparison to Mumbai or Thane, which have recorded over 500% rise in detections during the December 27-January 2 period as against the previous week. A Union health ministry analysis showed that cases rose by 139% in Pune during the week ending January 2 as against the previous week. In stark contrast, the detections increased by a staggering 625% in Mumbai during the same period, followed by Palghar (546%), Thane (533%) and Raigad (348%). Weekly positivity rate in Pune district has also been lower than cities like Mumbai and Thane, state health department data till January 4 showed. While Pune recorded a weekly positivity rate of 6.1%, it stood at 8% for Palghar, 8.7% for Raigad, 9.8% for Thane and 14% for Mumbai. A senior health department official told TOI, “Cities like Mumbai have a lot of migrant population, a segment not included in the actual target of eligible beneficiaries to be vaccinated. This unvaccinated population could be one of the reasons for the rise in Covid cases. Similarly, within Pune district, the rise in Covid cases has been higher in the urban areas than rural, as city limits have a number of migrants, who may still be unvaccinated.” Pune ZP CEO Ayush Prasad told TOI, “Pune rural witnessed the long Covid tail phenomenon during the second wave. Therefore, a large number of people have been carrying antibodies against the infection in addition to being vaccinated. The rise in cases has mostly also been in the 23 villages merged in the PMC limits.” Dr Kapil Zirpe, member of the Pune Covid-19 task force and head of the neurotrauma unit of Ruby Hall Clinic, said, “Many factors influence the pace at which infections rise in a city, including adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour.” Dr Sanjay Pujari from the ICMR National Task Force on Clinical Research for Covid-19, said, “The increase in the pace of infections should also be assessed on the basis of case positivity rate and cases per million population, which can make comparisons between areas with different population sizes and also account for testing capacities. Absolute numbers alone can be influenced by various factors, including the number of tests conducted, those taking self tests and the proportion of rapid testing versus RT-PCR etc.” Data showed that 15,000-16,000 tests have been conducted in Pune district for the last few days.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/case-rise-pace-in-pune-far-lower-than-most-dists-data/articleshow/88744275.cms||Neha Madaan
