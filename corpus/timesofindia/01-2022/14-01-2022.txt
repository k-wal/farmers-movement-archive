The top US diplomat renewed calls for North Korea to sit down for talks with the United States, which he said harbored no "hostile intent" toward Kim Jong Un's regime. "I think some of this is North Korea trying to get trying to get attention. It's done that in the past; it'll probably continue to do that," Blinken said in a televised interview with MSNBC. North Korea's tests are "profoundly destabilizing, it's dangerous, and it contravenes a whole host of UN Security Council resolutions," Blinken said. North Korean state media reported on Wednesday that Kim personally oversaw a successful launch of a hypersonic missile, the second such launch by the nuclear-armed nation in less than a week. Washington soon afterward announced sanctions on five North Koreans linked to the ballistic missile program. Diplomacy has been at a standstill since Kim held three meetings with former president Donald Trump, who took an unusually personal approach to the diplomacy. Trump's talks did not produce a lasting agreement and North Korea has not shown interest in offers of lower-level engagement by President Joe Biden's administration.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-secretary-of-state-antony-blinken-says-north-korea-launches-may-be-seeking-attention/articleshow/88884668.cms||---

At least five passengers on board were left dead and another 20 were injured as 12 bogies of the Guwahati-bound Bikaner Express derailed in West Bengal’s Jalpaiguri district. The last time passenger deaths were reported in an accident were in March 22, 2019. The news came as a shock to the rail ministry headquarters and shortly after the railway board ordered a high level investigation by the commissioner of railway safety. Railway board chairman V K Tripathi and the director general (safety) rushed to the spot. Union railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw also left for the site to take stock of the situation. Vaishnaw announced enhanced ex gratia relief of Rs 5 lakh for death, Rs 1 lakh for the grievously injured and Rs 25,000 for simply injured persons. Officials said the reason for the derailment was unclear and detailed investigation will reveal the exact cause of the fatal accident. In February last year, then Union railways minister Piyush Goyal had informed the Rajya Sabha that not a single passenger death had occurred due to train accidents after March 22, 2019. Vaishnaw had also informed the Rajya Sabha on July 30 last year that there was no railway passenger death during 2019-20 and 2020-21. Prior to that in 2018-19, railways had recorded 16 deaths, 28 deaths in 2017-18 and 195 deaths during 2016-17, according to the written reply by the minister. The achievement of zero passenger death in 2019-20 was hailed as the first such achievement by the national transporter in its 166-year-long history. The railways keep a record of all the deaths that occur on its premises under three separate heads - consequential accidents, trespassing and untoward incidents – and the passenger death due to derailment, collision or any other fault are recorded as fatalities in consequential accidents. Incidents like people run over after coming on the tracks or deaths caused because of people standing on the footboard of trains or hanging out of trains are recorded as trespassing and untoward incidents.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/railways-report-first-passenger-deaths-in-accident-after-gap-of-nearly-34-months/articleshow/88884627.cms||Dipak K Dash

A police official said that at about 6 pm on Wednesday the security forces had received human intelligence about the presence of a terrorist in Kulgam’s Sehpura village. "A joint operation involving Indian Army and JKP personnel was launched. Suspected houses were cordoned off. At about 8.45 pm, as the security forces were carrying out house-to-house searches, the holed-up terrorist opened fire with an AK and lobbed a grenade towards the security forces," a police spokesman said. "The security forces exercised restraint initially and evacuated civilians from the area and from that particular house. In the process, one JKP constable, Rohit Chibb, was killed and three soldiers and two civilians were injured," he said. The official said that the injured were evacuated to a military hospital and one of the injured civilians was flown to a hospital in an Army helicopter. All the injured were stated to be stable. The encounter ended on Thursday morning when the security forces searched the hideout and recovered arms and ammunition from the site. J&K DGP Dilbag Singh, meanwhile, said precautions were being taken to save the lives of civilians during encounters. "A good number of terrorists were neutralised in the beginning of 2022 and people have sighed with relief after the elimination of these terrorists. In the coming days, more stringent action will be taken against terrorists and a peaceful environment will prevail soon with the support of the people." Later, IGP (Kashmir) Vijay Kumar, DIG (South Kashmir) and the Kulgam SSP visited the encounter site and the SOG camp at Nillow Kulgam and interacted with police, Army and CRPF personnel. "The IGP and DIG visited Shopian and Pulwama and reviewed security and operational aspects," the official said.

---||World||Rights of Afghan women, girls under attack: UN||ISLAMABAD: The United Nations Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) on Thursday raised serious concerns about the situation of women and girls in Afghanistan, saying they have been suffering immensely following the Taliban takeover of the country in mid-August 2021. The UN body claimed that Afghan girls and women have been deprived of their basic rights. “The fundamental rights of Afghan women and girls are under attack and they need the UN’s support and solidarity now more than ever,” OCHA said, adding that 11.8 million women and girls need urgent humanitarian assistance in Afghanistan. According to the UN office, humanitarian organizations must aim to scale up assistance to women and girls by providing food, healthcare, education, livelihood opportunities and protection services. OCHA’s tweet follows a gathering of about two-dozen women activists in Kabul on Wednesday night who lit candles during a demonstration. The women said they stayed awake all night and “lit candles for freedom”. Reacting to the UN’s remarks, the Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said that since the Islamic Emirate has been in power, all the people enjoy their rights and the UN report on women’s rights is based on “false information”. Since regaining control of Afghanistan, Taliban representatives had promised to respect women’s rights to work and education within an ill-defined Islamic framework. But the government’s actions over the past few months strongly suggest that the Islamic group has seriously restricted their movement and activities. They cannot go to work or travel without a male guardian. Under the Taliban rule, girls over the age of 12 have been prohibited from attending school and women have been expelled from many areas of the labour force, including the media and entertainment fields. The previous government’s ministry of women affairs has been abolished and its office has been replaced by a ministry for propagation of virtue and prevention of vice. Afghan women have no representation in the cabinet of the interim Taliban government.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/rights-of-afghan-women-girls-under-attack-un/articleshow/88884988.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

---||World||MI5 names Chinese ‘agent’ linked to Labour MP awarded Padma Shri by India||LONDON: Labour MP Barry Gardiner, who was awarded a Padma Shri in January 2020, has been named by MI5 as an MP who has received funds from an alleged Chinese spy trying to subvert democratic processes in the UK Parliament. Christine Ching Kui Lee has been a long-time funder of Gardiner’s office through her law firm Christine Lee & Co, which has offices in London and Birmingham and which also acts as chief legal adviser to the Chinese embassy in London. Gardiner has also been employing Lee’s son, Daniel Wilkes, in his Westminster office, but Wilkes resigned on Thursday. Gardiner represents Brent North, an area with a large Indian diaspora, and has been very popular with the Indian diaspora in Britain. In January 2020, he was awarded the Padma Shri. MI5, Britain’s security service, issued a bombshell warning to MPs on Thursday saying that Chinese national Christine Ching Kui Lee is "knowingly engaged in political interference activities on behalf of the United Front Work Department of the Chinese Communist Party. Lee has acted covertly in coordination with the UFWD and is judged to be involved in political interference activities in the UK". MI5 warned that the UFWD is seeking to covertly interfere in UK politics through "establishing links with established and aspiring parliamentarians across the political spectrum" in order to ensure that the UK political landscape is "favourable to the CCP’s agenda". The mail said that Lee has been involved in the "facilitation of financial donations" to political parties, parliamentarians and aspiring parliamentarians and individuals seeking political office in the UK. The news has sent shockwaves throughout the Indian community in Britain. There is no evidence Gardiner knew she was a spy. Gardiner said in a statement: "I have been liaising with our security services for a number of years about Christine Lee and they have always known, and been made fully aware by me, of her engagement with my office and the donations she made to fund researchers in my office in the past. I have been assured by the security services that whilst they have definitively identified improper funding channelled through Christine Lee, this does not relate to any funding received by my office. Christine Lee’s son volunteered in my office many years ago and was subsequently employed by me as a diary manager. He resigned from my employment earlier today." Community leader Harendra Jodha said: "These are lawmakers. Their staff should be vetted properly as this is a matter of national security. Barry Gardiner should now come out and state all the facts. It is alarming as he was awarded the Padma Shri. We need to know whether he was involved with policy-making with regard to India." Another source in the Indian community who knows Gardiner said: "When he was shadow secretary of state for international trade he used to travel to China often. That may be where he picked up these contacts. He has not even gone to India to accept his Padma Shri despite having received letters requesting him to accept it. The Indian government gave him the Padma Shri for his work with the Indian community and the Gujarati community. So far he has declined to go to Delhi to accept it citing Covid. The Indian government would not have known about this. If this is really true, that he had a Chinese agent working for him, this will have a detrimental impact on his relationship with the Indian community. There is a tense border situation in India with China. If a British MP with an Indian majority constituency is close to the Chinese government, that is not welcome at all." In the House of Commons on Thursday Sir Iain Duncan Smith, the former Conservative Party leader, said he had received an email from the Speaker informing him that "an agent of the Chinese government has been active here in Parliament — working with a member of Parliament — obviously to subvert the processes here". "How can a foreign, despotic and despicable power, which is hellbent on reducing many people to penury, put somebody into this mother of Parliaments and that individual have nothing done to them other than not being allowed into Parliament," he asked. The UFWD identifies and cultivates individuals to promote the CCP’s agenda. UFWSD actors have been known to be involved in political interference activity, seeking to deceive, corrupt or coerce politicians and high-profile individuals into making statements or taking action in support of the CCP and to silence voices critical of the CCP.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/mi5-names-chinese-agent-linked-to-labour-mp-awarded-padma-shri-by-india/articleshow/88885093.cms||NAOMI CANTON
---||World||Leader of Oath Keepers militia charged with seditious conspiracy in US Capitol riot||WASHINGTON: US prosecutors on Thursday charged Stewart Rhodes, the founder of the far-right Oath Keepers militia, and 10 other people with seditious conspiracy for their role in the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. It marked the first time prosecutors brought that charge against defendants in the attack. The crime is defined as attempting "to overthrow, put down or to destroy by force the government of the United States." Supporters of former President Donald Trump that day stormed the Capitol in a failed bid to stop Congress from certifying his election loss to President Joe Biden. The attack occurred shortly after Trump in a speech repeated his false claims that his loss was the result of widespread voting fraud and urged his supporters to go to the Capitol and "fight like hell" to stop the election from being stolen. The Oath Keepers are a loosely organized group of activists who believe that the federal government is encroaching on their rights, and focus on recruiting current and former police, emergency services and military members. Prosecutors said that beginning in late December 2020, Rhodes used private encrypted communications to plan to travel to Washington on Jan. 6. He and others planned to bring weapons to the area to help support the operation, they said. While some of the Oath Keeper members rushed inside the building wearing tactical gear, others remained stationed outside in what they deemed "quick-response force" teams, which were prepared to rapidly transport arms into the city, prosecutor said. The indictment alleges that Thomas Caldwell, a previous defendant in the case, and Edward Vallejo of Arizona, a new defendant in the case, were in charge of coordinating these quick-response force teams. Seditious conspiracy is a felony carrying a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. Nine of the 11 defendants were already facing other charges. US Attorney General Merrick Garland, on the day before the anniversary of the attack last week, vowed to hold accountable anyone involved in the riot. The department has charged more than 725 people with crimes arising from the attack. Of those people, about 165 have pleaded guilty and at least 70 have been sentenced. Garland said the Justice Department would "follow the facts wherever they lead." Over the years, the Justice Department obtained seditious conspiracy convictions against Puerto Rican nationalists and alleged Islamist militants including Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman, the radical Islamic clergyman known as the "Blind Sheikh." Seditious conspiracy charges featured prominently in a case federal authorities brought in 1987 against leaders and members of a neo-Nazi group known as The Order. Fourteen alleged members or supporters were indicted, with 10 facing seditious conspiracy counts. After a two-month trial, a jury acquitted all defendants.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/leader-of-oath-keepers-militia-charged-with-seditious-conspiracy-in-us-capitol-riot/articleshow/88885138.cms||---

Safety protocols that discourage gatherings, fears of the new variant and a general precautionary vibe, is not making the vibrant kite fest go off to a flying start, quite literally. However, in the city’s lanes and street stalls where kites are made, the mood is hopeful. We chatted with some kite-makers about how they’re feeling and how sales have been this year... ‘Business is 60-70 per cent less since the last two years’Prashant Jadhav, a kite seller from Santacruz (East), says things have been bleak ever since the pandemic began. “Our business is 60-70 per cent less since the last two years. We are selling kites, but just a few. If earlier, we sold 3,000 kites for the festival, now even managing a few hundred is tough. We are hoping that people buy kites today. It is tough to convince anyone because there are genuine fears. Also, Mumbai has very few playgrounds and open spaces and now due to restrictions, many of them are closed. All this is affecting business.” ‘There are no Bollywood releases, so no pictures of stars on kites’Superhero kites are attractive to kidsIf Mumbai is synonymous with Bollywood, then can festivals in the city be far behind? Every year, you will find B-town stars on firecracker boxes and packets, and at Makar Sankranti, too, the skies are aflutter with pictures of stars on kites. But that’s also going to be largely missed this year, and there’s a reason for it. Informs Haji Muqueem Khan, wholesaler and retailer of kites and manja at Bhendi Bazaar, “Har saal Bollywood ke itney kite hotey hain, par ab filmein hi kahan release ho rahi hain? Toh Bollywood ke patang ka sawaal nahi hai.” He adds, “Makar Sankranti is low-key for sure. Earlier, kids would always throng the shops to buy kites accompanied by the elders, but this time we’ve been only seeing a few adult customers coming to buy kites.” What other design is popular now, we ask? “We have mainly two kinds — Bareilly kites made of paper and China kites. The China ones are made of cloth and look good, but you can’t compete with it. They’re just for solo flying or as a decoration,” he adds. ‘Plain paper kites get sold the most’Imran Khan, of a kite shop at Byculla, says, “Fancy kites may look good, but it is the regular paper kites with plain paper that get sold more. They are easier to fly and cost just ` 10 per piece. The design-based ones are made of foil and you can’t fly them the same way. Other than plain ones, folding kites with a dragon, Batman, Spiderman and other superheroes are also available. But it is all last year’s stock. This time, the kite stock has not arrived in the market due to the COVID-19 situation. And no one I know even wants to make an investment to procure kites due to this. What would be a packed month, has been dull. People would start buying kites from the start of January, but this time business is very slow.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/makar-sankranti-spiderman-kites-in-demand-bollywood-faces-take-a-back-seat/articleshow/88878470.cms||Ismat Tahseen

At the same time, the court is allowing the administration to proceed with a vaccine mandate for most health care workers in the US The court's orders Thursday during a spike in coronavirus cases was a mixed bag for the administration's efforts to boost the vaccination rate among Americans. The court's conservative majority concluded the administration overstepped its authority by seeking to impose the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's vaccine-or-test rule on U.S. businesses with at least 100 employees. More than 80 million people would have been affected. ``OSHA has never before imposed such a mandate. Nor has Congress. Indeed, although Congress has enacted significant legislation addressing the COVID-19 pandemic, it has declined to enact any measure similar to what OSHA has promulgated here,'' the conservatives wrote in an unsigned opinion. In dissent, the court's three liberals argued that it was the court that was overreaching by substituting its judgments for health experts. ``Acting outside of its competence and without legal basis, the Court displaces the judgments of the Government officials given the responsibility to respond to workplace health emergencies,`` Justices Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor wrote in a joint dissent. The vaccine mandate that the court will allow to be enforced nationwide covers virtually all health care workers in the country. More than 208 million Americans, 62.7% of the population, are fully vaccinated, and more than a third of those have received booster shots, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. All nine justices have gotten booster shots.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/supreme-court-halts-covid-19-vaccine-rule-for-us-businesses/articleshow/88885406.cms||---

There should be minimum damage to the livelihood of the common people, economic activities, and the momentum of the economy (should) be maintained. It is very important to keep these things in mind while making any (containment) strategy,” Modi said. At a virtual interaction, Modi suggested to CMs to focus on local containment of the infection with effective monitoring and treatment in home isolation, while enhancing vaccination coverage. The comments came on the back of businesses petitioning the government, both the Centre and states, to go for micro-containment strategies linked to bed occupancy in hospitals as opposed to the overall case count. Economists and think tanks have also warned that economic activities, which seemed to be normalising, may face headwinds from the Omicron variant. Modi, along with home minister Amit Shah and health minister Mansukh Mandaviya, held a virtual interaction with the CMs as daily Covid-19 cases increased to a shade under 2.5 lakh on Wednesday, the highest in 236 days. The total active caseload in the country stood at a little less than 11.2 lakh on Thursday morning.

Home minister Amit Shah and health minister Mansukh Mandaviya also attended the meeting, which was held via videoThe PM underlined the importance of vaccination and said it is the most potent way to deal with Covid-19, irrespective of variants. Saying that the indigenously produced vaccines have proven their superiority across the globe, he said misinformation against shots must be dispelled effectively. While noting that Omicron was spreading faster, the PM advised caution but warned against a situation that causes panic. “We have to see that in this festive season, the alertness of the people and administration is not lowered anywhere. The way the central and state governments had adopted a pre-emptive, proactive and collective approach, the same is the mantra of victory this time as well,” he said. Modi suggested that the government should be able to provide treatment under home isolation, for which the guidelines should keep evolving. At the same time, the PM also pitched for constant expansion of the health infrastructure, for which Rs 23,000 crore had been granted by the Centre. “In order to defeat Corona, we need to keep our readiness ahead of every variant. Along with tackling Omicron, we need to start preparing for any future variant from now itself,” he said.

The PM also urged states to expedite coverage of ‘precaution dose’ (booster), which has been rolled out for health and frontline workers along with those above 60 years of age with comorbidities from January 10. “The sooner we give precautionary dose to frontline workers and senior citizens, the stronger our healthcare system will become,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/omicron-surge-focus-on-local-containment-minimise-damage-to-economy-says-pm-modi/articleshow/88885011.cms||Sushmi Dey

With several passengers still trapped inside two badly mangled bogies, officials fear the toll could rise further. There were 1,053 passengers on board, said a Northeast Frontier Railway (NFR) official. Doctors said the condition of at least 10 injured was critical. Sources said the train was travelling at 40kmph when the derailment occurred. The train left New Domohani station around 4.53pm and was heading to New Maynaguri when the mishap happened. The train had passengers who were returning to Assam to celebrate Bhogali Bihu, which marks the end of the harvest season in Assam. Railway officials said there were fewer passengers on board than usual on account of Covid. Initially, it appears that a crack on the tracks caused the accident. Track repairs were reportedly under way on the stretch. A high-level railway safety inquiry has been ordered.

"We're ready either way," Sullivan told reporters after a week of talks between the United States, its Western allies and Russia. "We're ready to make progress at the negotiating table... and we're ready to take the necessary and proper steps to defend our allies, support our partners and respond robustly to any naked aggression that might occur." Russia has amassed tens of thousands of troops on the border with Ukraine as it demands guarantees that NATO will not expand the alliance eastward. "The intelligence community has not made an assessment that the Russians have definitively decided to take a military course of action in Ukraine," Sullivan said. "So as things stand right now, Russia has the opportunity to come to the table." Russian deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov, who led talks in Geneva with US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, in an interview Thursday did not rule out Moscow sending forces to allies Venezuela or Cuba if diplomacy failed. "I don't want to confirm that... nor exclude it," he said. Sullivan called the remarks "bluster" and said Russia did not raise the idea in discussions. "If Russia were to move in that direction, we would deal with it decisively," Sullivan said. The United States and the then-Soviet Union are considered to have come closest to nuclear war in 1962 when Moscow deployed ballistic missiles to Cuba, setting off crisis diplomacy.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-ready-for-russia-diplomacy-and-to-defend-allies-national-security-advisor-jake-sullivan/articleshow/88885977.cms||---

Releasing ISFR 2021, environment minister Bhupender Yadav emphasised on the government's priority to focus not just on increasing/conserving the forest cover quantitatively but also enriching it qualitatively, and noted that 17 states/UT’s have above 33% of the geographical area under forest cover. Yadav also underlined India's commitment to increase green cover, and reminded what Prime Minister Narendra Modi had promised at the UN climate conference (COP26) in Glasgow (UK) in November last year when he appealed to world leaders to focus on LIFE (Lifestyle for Environment) as a joint global campaign for a sustainable future. ISFR 2021 shows that five states/UTs — Lakshadweep, Mizoram, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Arunachal Pradesh and Meghalaya — have more than 75% forest cover while 12 states/UTs — Manipur, Nagaland, Tripura, Goa, Kerala, Sikkim, Uttarakhand, Chhattisgarh, Dadra & Nagar Haveli and Daman & Diu, Assam, Odisha — have forest cover between 33% and 75%. Overall, the increase in forest cover has, however, been mainly observed in the "open forest" category followed by "very dense forest". Forest cover includes all land more than one hectare in area with a tree canopy density of more than 10%. Land with a tree canopy density of 70% and above is classified as "very dense forest (VDF)" while land with a canopy density of 10% and more but less than 40% is classified as "open forest (OF)". Similarly, land with a canopy density of 40% and more but less than 70% is put under the "moderately dense forest (MDF)" category, which, in fact, reported a decline of 1,582 sq km in 2021 compared to 2019. In addition to the three density classes, scrub areas (forest lands with a canopy density of less than 10%) have also been classified and mapped. But scrub areas are not part of the forest cover. The top three states showing an increase in forest cover are Andhra Pradesh (647 sq km), Telangana (632 sq km) and Odisha (537 sq km). Area-wise, Madhya Pradesh has the largest forest cover in the country followed by Arunachal Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha and Maharashtra. In terms of forest cover as percentage of total geographical area, the top five states are Mizoram (84.5%), Arunachal Pradesh (79.3%), Meghalaya (76%), Manipur (74.3%) and Nagaland (73.9%). The report provides information on forest cover, tree cover, mangrove cover, growing stock, carbon stock in India’s forests, forest fire monitoring, above-ground estimates of biomass using satellite data and climate change hotspots in Indian forests. The forest and tree cover areas have been derived from complete wall-to-wall mapping of the country’s forest cover using remote sensing techniques, sample plot-based national forest inventory and special studies carried out at the national level. The Forest Survey of India, which prepared the report, claimed that the satellite data interpretation is followed by rigorous ground truthing. "Information from other collateral sources is also used to improve the accuracy of the interpreted image. The accuracy level achieved in the current assessment is significantly high," said the environment ministry. It claimed that the accuracy of forest cover classification has been assessed at 92.9%. "The accuracy of classification between forest and non-forest classes has been assessed 95.8% against internationally accepted accuracy of classification of more than 85%," said the ministry. The biennial report has also for the first time included a special chapter on forest cover assessment in tiger reserves, tiger corridor areas, lion conservation areas and in seven major cities — Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, Chennai and Kolkata. It is seen that Delhi has the largest forest cover, followed by Mumbai and Bengaluru. The latest assessment also shows an increase of 17 sq km in total mangrove cover (4,992 sq km in 2021) in the country as compared to the previous assessment. The top three states showing mangrove cover increase are Odisha (8 sq km), Maharashtra (4 sq km) and Karnataka (3 sq km).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indias-green-cover-rises-touches-nearly-one-fourth-of-geographical-area-report/articleshow/88885967.cms||Vishwa Mohan

Deaths from the virus remained relatively low but were rising. With data from Tripura awaited at the time of writing, 218 fatalities were reported on Thursday, the second consecutive day of 200-plus deaths. The cumulative toll in the last seven days has nearly doubled to 1,096 from 562 in the preceding seven days. India on Thursday had recorded 2,63,488 fresh cases till late at night, with the final tally likely to be close to 2.64 lakh. Apart from Monday when the tally had actually dipped, this was the first time during the third wave when the daily growth in cases fell below 10%. While Delhi (28,867) and Chennai (8,219) recorded their highest-ever single-day tally of new cases, Mumbai reported a 15% dip in numbers. Cases in Mumbai had risen sharply on Wednesday after four previous days of decline which could indicate a flattening of the curve in the city. Several states, including Maharashtra (46,406), Punjab (6,083 cases), Jharkhand (4,000), Assam (3,238) and Himachal Pradesh (1,773), reported a slight drop in daily cases. However, cases continued to surge in Karnataka, which reported 25,005 fresh infections, up from 21,390 on Wednesday. Of these, 18,374 were from Bengaluru alone. Other states where infections were rising sharply included Tamil Nadu (20,911, up from 17,934), Odisha (10,059, up from 8,778) and Andhra Pradesh (4,348, up from 3,205). Bengal continued to report high numbers, 23,467 cases on Thursday, with Kolkata accounting for 6,768. While there has been a slowdown in the Covid surge in Maharashtra, deaths have been rising steadily. The state reported 36 fatalities on Thursday, the highest daily toll in months. Bengal recorded 26 deaths while the daily toll in Delhi dropped slightly to 31 from 40 on the previous day. Tamil Nadu recorded 25 deaths, Karnataka eight, and Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Bihar seven each.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/covid-19-new-cases-at-2-6-lakh-deaths-cross-200-for-second-consecutive-day/articleshow/88885958.cms||Amit Bhattacharya

North Korea's recent development of a "new-type weapon" was just part of its efforts to modernize its national defence capability, and did not target any specific country or harm the security of neighboring countries, a spokesperson for North Korea's foreign ministry said in a statement carried by state news agency KCNA. The administration of US President Joe Biden on Wednesday imposed its first sanctions over North Korea's weapons programs following a series of North Korean missile launches, including two since last week. North Korea said the weapons were "hypersonic missiles" that would boost its strategic military forces. The US sanctions show that though Washington may talk of diplomacy and dialogue, "it is still engrossed in its policy for isolating and stifling" North Korea, the foreign ministry statement said. "The U.S. accusation of the DPRK's legitimate exercise of the right to self-defence is an evident provocation and a gangster-like logic," the statement said. DPRK are the initials of North Korea's official name. The spokesperson warned of an unspecified "stronger and certain reaction" if the United States adopts a confrontational stance.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/north-korea-calls-us-sanctions-provocation-warns-of-strong-reaction/articleshow/88886085.cms||---
---||World||Record US inflation growing concern for Fed, business||WASHINGTON: The scourge of rising prices now ranks among American business leaders' top concerns, according to a survey released Thursday, while Federal Reserve official indicated the central bank is ready to move against inflation. Official data shows signs the wave of increases may have peaked at the end of the year, but with inflation at its highest level in nearly four decades, more economists and some Fed officials say the central bank might have to be more aggressive to stem the surge. Inflation is the number-two worry among chief executives, behind labor shortages, and the price pressures could persist into 2023, according to a survey by The Conference Board released Thursday. "I'm very concerned about the high level of inflation," Fed Governor Lael Brainard said at her nomination hearing before the Senate Banking Committee. Brainard, whom President Joe Biden nominated to serve as vice chair of the central bank, said most forecasts show prices are likely to stay high for the first half of the year and come down later in 2022. But she warned to "take these projections with a fair amount of caution." Brainard told lawmakers the Fed will focus on bringing inflation back down to its two-percent target but will do so "consistent with a sustained and strong recovery." The Fed's key inflation-fighting tool is the benchmark lending rate, which was slashed to zero at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. Many economists expect three rate hikes this year, but St Louis Federal Bank President James Bullard said Wednesday policymakers might have to be more aggressive and raise four times. Another regional Fed president, Raphael Bostic of Atlanta, said he was open to hiking as early as March. Brainard, however, said the moves would be made in a "well communicated way" to ensure a "measured" response by financial markets and allow the economy to continue to recover jobs. If confirmed, Brainard would replace Richard Clarida, who in a paper released prior to his Friday departure from the Fed argued that the price increases were closer to the Fed's target than they appear. "The unwelcome surge in inflation in 2021, once these relative price adjustments are complete and bottlenecks have unclogged, will in the end prove to be largely transitory under appropriate monetary policy," he wrote. The Fed's hawkish shift comes after the consumer price index ended the year with a seven percent jump, the highest since 1982, while the producer price index hit a record 9.7 percent. But the data showed price pressures easing in the final month of the year, with producer prices for energy and food declining. "Producer prices ended the year on an encouraging note, rising less than expectations as both the headline and core PPI moderated in December," said Mahir Rasheed of Oxford Economics. The Covid-19 pandemic has created shortages of critical goods like computer chips for cars while transportation snags have further fanned the inflation flames, all as new strains of the virus cause additional business disruptions. "Persistent supply disruptions will pin producer prices near record levels in the near term, especially given a rapidly spreading Omicron variant that will fan inflation pressures," Rasheed said. The price surge has battered Biden's reputation even as the economy recovers from the damage inflicted by the pandemic, and his White House welcomed signs the pressures might be abating. "Monthly inflation results are always volatile, and this report was driven in large part by a reduction in highly volatile energy and food prices, but also reflects potential improvement in prices for supply-chain related goods and services," said Cecilia Rouse, head of the White House Council of Economic Advisors. But she said the data underscores the need to continue to work to resolve the supply chain issues. "Even as the economy has had a historic recovery, we continue to face challenges with prices driven by supply chain disruptions around the world."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/record-us-inflation-growing-concern-for-fed-business/articleshow/88886153.cms||---

---||India||If sex worker has right to say no to sex, why should a wife be less empowered: HC||NEW DELHI: Can a wife be put on a lower pedestal or be less empowered than a sex worker who has the right to say no at any stage, the Delhi high court said on Thursday while hearing a batch of petitions on marital rape. The court’s remarks came when it pointed out that to exclude “certain circumstances” from the ambit of rape “because of inter-party relationship” is problematic and that the marital rape exception could be examined in the light of protection granted to sex workers in rape law. A bench of justices Rajiv Shakdher and C Hari Shankar heard the court-appointed amicus on reasons why the exception granted under Section 375 (rape) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) must be struck down. Justice Shakdher pointed out that the rape laws grant no exemption in case of forced intercourse with a sex worker who chooses to withdraw consent at a belated stage, wondering why then should a wife be “less empowered”. “Our courts have gone as far as saying she can say no at any stage. Can a wife be put at a lower pedestal? Be less empowered in law?” he said. Amicus Raj Shekhar Rao added that the foundation of Section 375 was the lack of consent and there was no reason to give less protection to a married woman against non-consensual intercourse. He also informed the bench that he has received suggestions from various quarters. “Advocate Rushab Aggarwal highlighted that Section 375 contemplates a case of mistaken identity by the wife of the man being her husband. It talks about a wife giving consent under a mistaken identity, which shows even in a marriage, the element of consent is to be given,” Rao submitted. However, Justice Shankar said that the expectation of sex in the case of a marital relationship was not the same as in the instance of a sex worker. “We have to show that the legislature, in not making it (the offence) punishable as rape, has acted unconstitutionally. Let us not equate the two, you are on a sticky wicket here,” he said. The judge also noted that most of the arguments were on “outrage rather than law” and asked Rao to focus on legal aspects. “We are a court, we should not undermine (sic) by only showing angst and plight of wives, rather we also have to see the legal aspects,” he added. Meanwhile, the Centre on Thursday told the high court that it was considering a “constructive approach” to the issue of criminalising marital rape and has sought suggestions from state governments, the Chief Justice of India, MPs and others on comprehensive amendments to entire criminal law. Justice Rajiv Shakdher revealed that Solicitor General Tushar Mehta mentioned the matter before him earlier in the day. Central government lawyer Monika Arora told the bench that the Centre was undertaking a comprehensive task of amending the criminal law, which includes IPC Section 375. The court will continue hearing the matter on Friday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/if-sex-worker-has-right-to-say-no-to-sex-why-should-a-wife-be-less-empowered-hc/articleshow/88886063.cms||Abhinav Garg

The last time more people had tested positive in a single day was during the middle of the second wave on May 8 last year, when 3,441 cases were recorded. Gurugram also witnessed a spike in the daily positivity rate, which rose from 22% to 24% on Thursday. The city has 15,175 active cases at present and 15,063 patients are in home isolation and 112 in hospitals. There is no active Omicron case at present. A total of 1,109 Covid patients also recovered on the day. The health department said that the worst is not over as the peak is yet to come. “We are expecting a further spike in cases in the coming days. In the second wave, the city had witnessed the highest single-day tally of 5,000 cases. This time, the figure exceed that,” chief medical officer Virender Yadav said. In the wake of the surge, testing has been ramped up, he added. On Wednesday, 12,576 samples were collected. Doctors said that most of the Covid patients at present are young adults. Dr Shuchin Bajaj, founder-director of Ujala Cygnus Group of Hospitals, said, “They have mild symptoms, which are very similar to the last wave — cough, cold, fever and body ache. But there also is a new symptom of fever with extreme shivering and chills. Doctors are mostly advising anti-inflammatory drugs. Patients are being monitored at home through telemedicine and they are usually recovering within four to five days.” Haryana reported 7,591 new cases and a positivity rate of 15.4% on Thursday. While Gurugram registered the highest new cases in the state, Faridabad followed with 1,107 cases, followed by Panchkula (701), Ambala (447) and Sonipat (420). At present, the state has 35,979 active patients, of whom 29,986 are in home isolation. It has carried out 49,513 tests in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, as many as 2,934 people in the 15-17 age group were vaccinated in Gurugram on Thursday. A total of 14,902 people in the 18-44 group took the shots.  In the 45-59 age category, 1,381 people were inoculated while 1,246 people aged above 60 years got jabs. A total of 437 healthcare workers and 257 frontline workers also got vaccinated. The fourth day of the booster vaccination drive in the city was similar to Day 1 with a low turnout of about 15%. Only 1,505 recipients got the jabs on Thursday while the health department had opened 10,000 slots — 5,000 for CoWIN-registered recipients and 5,000 for walk-ins — at 76 session sites. Nearly 38,000 healthcare and frontline workers and senior citizens with comorbidities are eligible for the booster dose in Gurugram. In the past four days, 8,606 such doses have been administered.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/daily-cases-cross-3k-highest-since-may-8/articleshow/88886196.cms||Ipsita Pati

---||Gurgaon||Neighbours Covid-hit, volunteers pitch in with food and medicines||Gurgaon: A collective crisis had brought out the best of humanity during the second wave of the pandemic as people helped each other with food, medicines, oxygen support or simply by being there. It’s no different this time. Good Samaritans in housing societies and neighbourhoods in various parts of the city are coming forward to help fellow residents affected by Covid, in many cases entire families. These volunteer groups have started providing free home-cooked meals to Covid patients and delivering other essential items to their doorsteps.Shalini Gumber, a resident of Sector 83’s Emaar Palm Garden, along with 21 other members of the housing society said they have started reaching out to families affected by the pandemic recently. “During the second wave, we formed a Covid task force group. With a recent spike in the cases, our team has once again started providing help to those who are in home isolation and have no immediate family members to help them through the crisis,” Gumber told TOI.Food from restaurants is not healthy for elderlies as such, she said, adding that the group has now started providing home-cooked food at the doorstep to Covid-hit families. “The society is like an extended family to us and we feel it is our duty to provide help in any way we can,” Gumber said.Echoing the sentiment, Sheeba Gupta, vice-president of Parsvnath Green Ville RWA in Sector 48, said they were also ensuring every possible help to residents who are recovering from the infection. “We had formed a PGV Happy Kitchen in September 2020 and are providing food to those families who are Covid affected and unable to cook for themselves. We have a group of 25 active members who voluntarily devote their time and services to ensure all affected families at least get healthy, hygienic and nutritious food.”The volunteer’s group at Mapsko Casabella in Sector 82 is also ensuring healthy food is available to the patients who are recuperating at home. “We have 20 families in the society who are lending their hand and providing a healthy meal for people affected by Covid,” Rao Dharamveer, RWA president of Casabella, said. Meanwhile, the Hemkunt Foundation, which played a vital role in providing oxygen cylinders during the second wave, has set up a 24x7 call centre (9990691313) to help deliver cooked meals, medicines and other essentials to Covid patients, especially for healthcare professionals and elderly staying alone.“We started this helpline last week but since the calls are increasing we have decided to make it 24x7. With health professionals themselves getting affected by Covid, we primarily want to help them and the elderly who are living alone across the country,” Harteerath Singh, community director of Hemkunt Foundation, told TOI.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/neighbours-covid-hit-volunteers-pitch-in-with-food-and-medicines/articleshow/88886198.cms||Akanksha Gupta
---||Gurgaon||Gurugram sees sharpest fall in forest cover in Haryana, dip in nine other districts too||GURUGRAM: The latest forest survey report has shown that Gurugram has lost nearly 2.5sqkm of forest cover, the highest in the state. The report by the Forest Survey of India, which was released on Thursday, also said that Haryana’s forest cover, on the other hand, increased by 1sqkm. The survey was conducted between October 2019 and February 2020 for the assessment year 2021. According to the report, while the state’s forest cover increased by 0.06% only, that across the country saw a rise of 0.22%. While Haryana’s forest cover was 1,602sqkm in October 2019, it increased to 1,602sqkm in February next year. But Gurugram is not the only district that saw a loss in forest cover. There were nine other districts — Faridabad, Bhiwani, Hisar, Jhajjar, Karnal, Mewat, Palwal, Rohtak and Yamunanagar. While Gurugram lost 2.47sqkm of forest cover during the four-month study period, Bhiwani saw a loss of 2.39sqkm, Nuh 0.55sqkm, Rohtak 0.74sqkm, Faridabad 0.71sqkm, Karnal 0.60sqkm and so on. Gurugram’s total forest area now stands at 113.71sqkm. Officials said the decrease in forest cover was because much of the land had been diverted for non-forest purposes while sanctioning development projects, particularly widening of roads. “Development projects, mostly roads, have taken away large chunks of forest land in Gurugram. In the coming years, more areas will be converted into non-forest categories because of several road widening projects,” said an official. Meanwhile, principal conservator of forests VS Tanwar pointed out two major reasons. “First, there have been several highway projects that are cutting through the forest areas. Another reason is agro-forestry activities, which are not being conducted because of the Covid situation. We would bring Eucalyptus saplings from Andhra Pradesh to increase our tree cover. But we haven’t been able to do that of late.” The tree cover, however, reduced by 140sqkm across the state. Tree cover is different from forests. It is defined as tree patches that are less than 1 hectare in size and are outside the areas marked as forests. Haryana’s tree cover reduced from 1,565sqkm to 1,425sqkm. Haryana’s forest policy, which was framed in 2006, had fixed a target of achieving 20% forest and tree cover in the state by 2020. But the latest report has definitely raised questions on what was achieved on the ground. “We are losing both tree and forest cover every year. The data clearly depicts the lack of intention on the part of the government to protect whatever remains of forest in the region,” said environmentalist Vaishali Rana Chandra. The green activists expressed some hope at the marginal rise in Haryana’s forest cover, but also flagged a cause for concern about the increasing infrastructure projects. “The trees that are outside of the forest conservation areas do not have any protection. So, they fall easy prey to urbanisation. The government’s action keeps hampering the forest areas of the state,” said Vivek Kamboj, an environmentalist. The experts pointed out that recent amendments to the PLP Act, 1900, would remove at least 240sqkm of the Aravali land in south Haryana from the state’s reserve forest area. Also, around 8,000 hectares of the Aravalis in Faridabad have not been considered part of the Natural Conservation Zone (NCZ) by the Haryana government. It is crucial for forests to remain under the NCZ as construction on land exceeding 0.5% of the total area is not permitted. The Faridabad cover, which the government has kept outside NCZ, will open up for real estate projects now.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/ggn-sees-sharpest-fall-in-forest-cover-in-haryana-dip-in-nine-other-dists-too/articleshow/88886199.cms||Ipsita Pati

Enforcement teams demolished unauthorised residential buildings and makeshift structures.Officials said that five unauthorised under-construction residential buildings in the restricted area around the IAF ammunition depot, two unauthorised structures in Rajendra Park and one each in Surat Nagar and the Daultabad industrial area were demolished. The building plan approvals of these structures were not taken from the civic body, according to the officials.“It is mandatory to take building plan approvals before carrying out any constriction in the MCG area. The entire process is online and residents can apply through their architects,” said SS Rohilla, MCG spokesperson. “The construction projects, which don't seek building plan approval, will be deemed unauthorised and demolished. The commissioner has constituted enforcement teams for each zone.” For the 900-metre restricted area, the MCG officials of zone 2 were directed in November last year to visit the place twice a week to check unauthorised construction and submit a weekly report. The officials were also directed that demolitions should take place on the same day they get information about any unauthorised construction. The civic body has divided the 900-metre restricted zone into three pockets to ensure that illegal structures in the area are identified and demolished. In order to ensure better enforcement, executive engineers monitor these divisions.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/illegal-structures-in-iaf-ammo-depot-buffer-zone-razed/articleshow/88886200.cms||---

Under the MoU, opportunities for energy efficiency and conservation measures will be explored in Gurugram University and both the institutions will work together towards its implementation. Besides sharing expertise in energy conservation, the university will also explore ways to develop EV charging infrastructure and ways to implement state government schemes related to EV promotion.“The objective of the MoU is to work in the field of energy efficiency comprehensively through mutual cooperation. There is a need to develop and nurture new partnerships aimed at promoting energy conservation and research through the collaborative efforts of both institutions. The aim of the MoU is to explore opportunities for energy efficiency and conservation measures in Gurugram University and work together for its implementation,” said Prof. Dinesh Kumar. The university and EESL will mutually explore the academic research in the field of energy conservation and methods to switch to a more sustainable form of energy usage. The thematic areas of the research would largely be around creating feasible electric vehicle charging infrastructure, solar rooftops, energy-efficient motors and pumps, indoor lighting, outdoor lighting including solar street lights and solar-powered split air conditioners.“The use of solar energy is the best way to go forward in conserving energy and reducing carbon footprint. Solar energy is also beneficial for the environment. When it is used, it does not release carbon dioxide and other harmful gases into the atmosphere, so the environment is not polluted. So, in countries like India, where the production of energy is expensive, these resources are the best option,” Kumar added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/gurugram-varsity-eesl-sign-mou-to-boost-ev-charging-infra/articleshow/88886201.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||Flaws in plan? What causes crashes on foggy days||GURUGRAM: The fatal crash on the Delhi-Gurugram expressway on Wednesday has once again put the spotlight on the accident mitigation efforts of traffic police and road construction agencies, especially during the foggy season when the visibility level drops. On Wednesday, a 27-year-old man died after his car rammed into a stationary pickup truck near Atlas Chowk. While a probe is under way, preliminary investigation has revealed that reduced visibility due to fog may have resulted in the driver not noticing the pickup truck parked on the expressway. Dense fog engulfs Delhi for third day, visibility drops to 50 metres at PalamRoad safety experts and road engineering scientists blamed lack of proper signage, flawed designs of intersections and underpasses, poor illumination and enforcement, and lack of scientific investigation of fatal accidents for such accidents during the foggy season. According to them, when a vehicle traveling at a speed of 80-100 kmph hits the brakes suddenly, it travels about 120-200 metres before coming to a standstill. Since visibility drops to the range of 10-20m or even lower due to fog, it becomes difficult for a driver to gauge the distance of a vehicle ahead of them. The problem is worsened when this is coupled with poor signage and markings, and the absence of speed calming measures, they said. Experts suggested that besides reducing the speed limit during the foggy season, the government should consider collaborating with a tech giant like Google to implement an intelligent traffic monitoring system (ITMS), through which users can be informed about upcoming turns, vehicle breakdowns and speed limits at least 200m in advance. “Under such a system, users will get the information that a vehicle has broken down 200m ahead and can change lanes, or that there’s a right turn ahead and can lower speed accordingly. At present, there isn’t proper signage to inform commuters. The ones that are there aren’t scientifically placed. ITMS is the need of the hour, especially for the Millenium City, which is considered to be hi-tech,” city-based road safety expert Sewa Ram said. Experts also said the Delhi-Gurugram expressway needs to be treated as a normal city road, with speed calming measures implemented accordingly. “The expressway cuts across habitation and is treated as a normal city road in a practical sense. So, our first step should be to accept that and then begin from there. Then, we can push for reducing the speed limit to 50 kmph and installing traffic signals and lane segregation rules,” said Sarika Panda Bhatt, a road safety expert. Asked what steps have been taken to prevent accidents due to poor visibility, traffic police claimed that they have constituted a fast fog action support team (F-FAST). Road safety officers have also been tasked to step up the drive to install reflector tapes on vehicles and accident-prone intersections, they said. F-FAST includes a zonal officer, one constable, two home guards and two road safety officers. Its task includes combing roads in the city and looking for road structures and other design issues which may become a safety hazard on low visibility days. “We have stepped up our efforts to find out road design flaws and coordinate with the agencies concerned to fix them. We have formed F-FAST to bring down road accidents due to fog. We have also stepped up our drive to install reflector tapes on vehicles and objects along roads like trees and poles,” DCP (traffic) RS Tomar said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/flaws-in-plan-what-causes-crashes-on-foggy-days/articleshow/88886203.cms||Siddharth Tiwari

The weather department has predicted dense to very dense fog on Friday. The minimum temperature, officials said, may touch five degrees by Sunday. In fact, throughout the day, the sun played hide and seek, making people uncomfortable with the cold. The maximum temperature was recorded at 16.4 degrees — three notches below the season’s normal. “Recent rain has brought moisture and a dip in temperature is causing the formation of fog in the region. Dense to very dense fog during the night and morning hours is expected to prevail in some parts, with a possibility of cold day conditions in isolated pockets,” said an Indian Meteorological Department official.  “There will be no significant change in minimum temperatures during the next three days. Two fresh western disturbances are likely to affect northwestern India first from January 16 and another from 18, which will bring light scattered rain,” the official said. Friday will witness partly cloudy conditions during the day, with the minimum and maximum temperature expected to hover around 7 and 18 degrees, respectively. The city’s air quality deteriorated on Thursday and slipped to ‘poor’ category after staying in ‘moderate’ category for three days. The overall air quality index (AQI) read at 282. “Air quality is likely to deteriorate due to the prevailing low wind speed and dip in temperature,” the IMD official said. Meanwhile in the capital, Thursday morning was the season’s third dense fog spell at Palam, while Safdarjung, which is Delhi's base weather station, recorded its first one. IMD said visibility dropped to 50 metres at Palam from 4.30am to 9.30am. The visibility remained between 50 and 100 metres at Safdarjung from 7am to 9.30am. The minimum temperature dropped to 5.8 degrees Celsius, two degrees below normal. The maximum temperature was recorded at 16.7 degrees Celsius, three notches below normal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/brace-for-dense-fog-min-temp-to-touch-5c-met/articleshow/88886204.cms||---

Also, industry status for the sector will help it access cheaper funding, said Ramesh Nair, CEO (India) and managing director (market development, Asia) at real estate management company Colliers.He said the government’s support in the form of liquidity infusion, fiscal support and reform-driven investments is timely to keep the real estate sector, amongst others, remain afloat and recover.Dhruv Agarwala, group CEO of Housing.com, Makaan.com and Proptiger.com, too said the sector needs aid from the Centre. “The realty sector is still plagued with two problems — unsold inventories and stalled projects. To deal with the challenges, the sector needs a hike in the corpus of the government-backed stress fund, SWAMIH, to at least Rs 1 lakh crore. This will help in completion of stuck projects and help regain consumers’ trust,” he said.Amarjit Bakshi, chairman and managing director of Gurgaon-based developer Central Park, said they also need credit availability for under-construction projects and more exemptions for buyers. “We hope that the government will work on reducing GST, circle rates and stamp duty,” he added.“We expect the government to double the amount of fund allocation for Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. Attention to input tax credit, reducing GST on building materials and tax holiday for affordable housing developers are needed,” said Pradeep Aggarwal, chairman of realtor Signature Global Group and of industry body Assocham's National Council on Real Estate, Housing and Urban Development.Rajat Goel, joint managing director of MRG World, another realtor, said the government should address the issue of making cheaper land available in major cities for affordable housing. “Apart from that, income tax benefits must also be increased, which will help bring in more investment in real estate,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/widen-affordable-housing-bracket-give-tax-benefits/articleshow/88886205.cms||Rao Jaswant Singh

With the entry of a Gurjar candidate in Jewar, there is a possibility of a split in the votes of the community, as earlier reported by TOI.BSP district president Lakhmi Chand said, “Our MLAs have served Jewar for 15 years and in Dadri, Satveer Gurjar served for 10 years before 2012. Manveer has been raising the voice of the farmers, daily wagers, homebuyers and residents of Greater Noida (west) troubled because their registries aren’t happening and other problems.”Kripa Ram (57), who earlier held the post of Noida mahanagar Congress president for as long as 16 years and switched to the BSP in December last year, said he would fight on the issues of the homebuyers. “The buyers are not getting registries and this will be my first priority. Second is the issue of private school fee hike. Women’s safety and the respect of the sanitation workers of Noida will also be my focus.”Manveer (41), who has been leading the fight for resolution of the farmers’ issues with the Greater Noida Authority, said, “The farmers have lost their land and the local youth are facing unemployment. We will ensure 50% reservation for locals in companies once we come to power. The issues of the homebuyers who are waiting for the Authority to do their registries will be raised by us.” Narendra Bhati (39), who changed his name to Narendra Dadha, said: “Farmers are fighting for 64% compensation and employment for local youth. On the name of Jewar airport, the BJP government has acquired land. The farmers should have been given four times compensation but due to the local BJP representatives, they got less compensation.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/known-faces-in-bsps-list-for-gb-nagar/articleshow/88886207.cms||Shikha Salaria

For the Noida seat, the party nominated Pankhuri Pathak, the vice-chairperson of the All India Congress Committee’s social media cell. Deepak Bhati Chotiwala, the national secretary for Youth Congress, was given the ticket from the Gurjar-dominated Dadri seat while district president Manoj Chaudhary was named from Jewar. Pathak has been active in student politics since her days at Delhi University’s Hansraj College. But she was with Samajwadi Party then. She has been with SP’s students wing since 2010, but switched to Congress in 2018. It will be a tough fight for Pathak in the Noida seat, which is currently held by BJP’s Pankaj Singh, Union minister Rajnath Singh’s son. Singh had in 2017 won the Noida seat by a huge margin. This time, BJP is yet to announce its candidates for any of the seats. Pathak, however, has been preparing her ground for the past two years — raising issues concerning homebuyers, civic amenities and deteriorating law and order both on social media and on the ground. Asked how confident she was about winning from Noida, which is considered a safe seat for BJP, Pankhuri said, “No seat should ever be without competition. No one should think they cannot be defeated. In all these years, the local MLA was completely missing from his constituency. People had to go to Delhi to meet him.” Chotiwala, who will contest from the Gurjar-dominated Dadri seat, is a member of the community himself. Originally from Bisrakh, Chotiwala had in June 2021 distributed Gangajal door-to-door in Dadri area as part of his “Gangajal sampark yatra”. His poll plank will revolve around three issues. “The first is that the authorities are not paying attention to the farmers’ issues. Secondly, despite the area being an IT hub, they have failed to generate employment. The third issue is the highhandedness of builders. People here are troubled by delayed possessions, frauds and lack of registries,” Chotiwala said. Chaudhary, too, will face a tough fight in the Jewar constituency. Four-time MP Avtar Singh Bhadana is contesting for the SP-RLD alliance in Jewar, which is currently held by BJP’s Dhirendra Singh. Chaudhary, who is also a part of the Jewar Kisan Sangharsh Samiti, has been raising his voice over different issues concerning the farmers and around the international airport project. Chaudhary has taken up the cause of four times compensation for the farmers from whom land was taken for the project. “The farmers were given compensation on a mutual understanding. Unemployment, cancellation of Dankaur as a block, and broken roads are also important issues here,” he said. In Ghaziabad, the party reposed its faith in old-timers when it announced the candidates for three of the five assembly seats. For Muradnagar, Congress named Bijendra Yadav (53), an old warhorse who has been with the party since 1988. “It’s been three decades that I have been with Congress. From an ordinary NSUI worker, I rose to the level of district president and AICC member,” said Yadav. “I am a known figure in Muradnagar. People have seen my work in all these years and I stand a fair chance of winning this time,” he added. Yadav is relying on a campaign by Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, the party’s in-charge in the state. “Priyanka Gandhi’s campaign has whipped up the right kind of sentiment among us and exposed BJP on several issues such as price rise, unemployment and women’s safety. All BJP has done is divide the society on communal lines,” he added. Yameen Malik has been fielded from Loni, which has a sizeable Muslim voter base. Malik is also the district president of Congress’s minority cell. For the Ghaziabad seat, Congress has given the ticket to Sushant Goyal. The 48-year-old comes from a traditional Congress family and is the son of Surendra Prakash Goyal, who had the seat in 2002 and again in 2004 as the Lok Sabha candidate.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/pankhuri-from-noida-as-cong-out-with-1st-list/articleshow/88889483.cms||Shikha Salaria

At least 45 doctors at Noida’s Sharda Hospital recently tested positive for the infection. In Ghaziabad, around 80 healthcare staff, including 15 doctors, have tested positive for the virus since December. At Noida’s Max Hospital, the focus is on the safety of doctors and catering to emergency patients, Dr Ashutosh Shukla, senior director (medicine) said. “The physical and mental wellbeing of our healthcare workers is our primary mandate. Other than ensuring PPE kits, they are being encouraged to receive booster doses. Currently, the number of healthcare workers falling sick is currently around 7-8 % so far. We are also ensuring that patients and their attendants adhere to Covid-appropriate behaviour,” Dr Shukla told TOI. Dr Manoj Luthra, the CEO of Noida’s Jaypee Hospital, said they have a reserve staff for the Covid facility. “In case, any healthcare worker tests positive, he or she can be replaced by the reserve staff. Our priority, however, is to ensure strict adherence to Covid protocols as per the ICMR guidelines. We ensure that our staff is fully vaccinated and are well-equipped with safety gear and PPE kit,” he said. Several hospitals have also created Covid wings with a dedicated team of doctors and staff. Additionally, healthcare workers are tested if they show any Covid-like symptoms. In Ghaziabad, a few facilities have introduced a “unit system” in super speciality and speciality departments. “If a doctor in any unit tests positive, others in that unit will fill in. We have over 300 doctors associated with us and are rotating the staff from other departments, too. Employees, who have even mild symptoms, are rested and they are mostly back in 7 days,” Dr Upasana Arora, the director of Yashoda Super Speciality Hospital in Ghaziabad, said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/docs-ve-how-hosps-are-rushing-to-plug-gaps/articleshow/88886214.cms||Abhijeet Singh
---||Ghaziabad||Cases rising, so what? No Covid fine in Ghaziabad||NOIDA/GHAZIABAD: Even as the number of daily Covid cases are breaking records, the implementation of Covid protocols like wearing masks or maintaining social distancing in markets and public places is still very lax in both Noida and Ghaziabad. Official data reveals that Ghaziabad is not even issuing challans against violators. For over six weeks now, the district has not fined a single person for flouting Covid norms. The district has as many as 567 public address systems, but they are hardly being put to use. Since December 1 last year, the district has registered just two cases under IPC Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant). Noida, on the other hand, is taking some action and levying fines on people not wearing masks. Since December 1 last year, the district has fined over 10,850 people and collected Rs 10.85 lakh in fines. There are 342 public address systems working in the district. And as many as nine cases have been registered under IPC Section 188 also. A visit to various markets in the two districts revealed that the majority of people were violating the face mask rule with impunity. In Ghaziabad, local markets in Turab Nagar, Ghanta Ghar, Navyug market among others were seen teeming with crowds, with most people not wearing masks. Despite a huge surge in cases, local police did not seem to be bothered about the situation. When contacted, Ghaziabad SSP Pawan Kumar said he would instruct cops to issue challans. “We are issuing challans at public places but more importantly, we are making people aware of the benefits of masks.” Ghaziabad has reported 9,489 cases since January 1 alone, while there are over 9,000 active cases in the district undergoing treatment at hospitals or homes. In Noida, the majority of local shopkeepers in the Sector 18 market were seen wearing masks, but the same could not be said about visitors. Rinki Saxena, a local shopkeeper, said, “During the day, police patrol the area and make announcements and even issue challans. But, people seem to be hardly scared.” When contacted, Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police, Noida, said cops have been working actively and making sure that the government orders are followed. “We have been carrying out drives across the district and spreading awareness. We are also issuing challans against those who violate the Covid norms," he told TOI. GB Nagar saw over 11,200 cases in January so far. The other districts of the Meerut zone — Meerut, Bulandshahr Baghpat — and Hapur are also very slack in taking violators to task.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ghaziabad/cases-rising-so-what-no-covid-fine-in-gzb/articleshow/88886215.cms||Aditya Dev

On September 28, 2013, Naeem and his two brothers, Nadeem and Shaukat, residents of Phugana village had filed a case at Phugana police station alleging that “Yogendra, Nitin Guddu and Vishal, along with dozens of other people” attacked their house on September 8. Naeem stated in his complaint that “the attackers were equipped with firearms and sharp-edged weapons,” and that they assaulted him and his family. He also said that they “ransacked our house and looted more than three lakh rupees, which they set on fire.” Defence lawyer Sohrab Singh said, “The complaina-nt and his two brothers, who were witnesses in the riots case, turned hostile and the accused were acquitted.” In October last year, a local court had let off 20 men due to lack of evidence. In December, five others were exonerated.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/muzaffarnagar-riots-4-accused-let-off-due-to-lack-of-evidence/articleshow/88886218.cms||Mohd Dilshad

The Hyderabad-bound aircraft had begun speeding for take-off when the taxiing Bengaluru-bound aircraft entered the same runway, which had the two aircraft on a collision course. The air traffic control stepped in and a high-speed rejected take-off carried out in time, saved the day.The incident occurred on January 9 at night when flight EK-524 bound for Hyderabad was on a take-off roll on Dubai runway 30R. “Since the taxiway-M, located between the parallel runways is currently not operational, to line up for departure, aircraft take a taxiway that cuts through active runway 30R,” said a senior commander, requesting anonymity. “The air traffic control often gives pilots a conditional clearance to take off. You can begin the take-off roll after a certain taxiing aircraft crosses the runway,” he added.Emirates, in a statement, said: “There was no aircraft damage, nor were there any injuries. Safety is always our top priority, and as with any incident we are conducting our own internal review.” tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/aircraft-for-hyd-bluru-escape-collision-in-dubai/articleshow/88886240.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Need a hospital only if O2 low, high fever for five days, say doctors on Omicron-Covid wave||Mumbai: Many seem to be writing off the Omicron-Covid wave as a simple cold, but doctors said there is a subset of patients who need ventilator support, ICU care or have very high fever of over 104 0F and severe cough, needing hospital care. “Around 10% to 20% of the patients who are in the ICU are bad,’’ said Dr Rahul Pandit, who is a member of the state government’s task force on Covid-19. On the positive side, most patients, almost 90%, don’t require any medicines, said Dr Gautam Bhansali, another task force member. “I would say that among my patients, only 5% need antibiotics and 1% need hosptialisation because of their persistent cough and fever,’’ he said. He said he hasn’t prescribed antivirals to any of his patients. So, who is the patient who needs more care and/or hospitalisation? Many patients are confused whether they should take the symptoms lightly like flu or seek immediate medical assistance. Consider 57-year-old businessman Ravi K who tested negative on a home-based kit but has had persistent fever for three days. “I did an RT-PCR test thereafter and tested positive. I have undergone an angioplasty and don’t know if I should seek a hospital bed,” he said. The key is to monitor oneself regularly during fever or other Covid symptoms such as bodyache, said doctors. “Any patient who has persistent fever of over 100 degrees for five days or has worsening cough that prevents them from uttering one sentence without coughing perhaps needs care,” said infectious diseases specialist Dr Anita Mathew from Fortis Hospital, Mulund. There also are other parameters to consider. “The patient’s oxygen saturation in blood should be 94 or lower before hospitalisation is considered,” added Dr Mathew. A BMC hospital doctor said that a patient with comorbidities such as diabetes or hypertension should regularly monitor their levels. “If there is a sharp drop in blood pressure or widely fluctuating sugar levels, then the Covid patient needs hospital care,” the doctor added. At hospitals, a moderately ill patient could be given a shortened three-day course of antiviral remdesivir to reduce the viral load and fever. “If Omicron is as mild as a flu, then Mumbai wouldn’t have witnessed the increase in hospitalisation as compared to early December,’’ said the doctor.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/docs-need-a-hosp-only-if-o2-low-high-fever-for-five-days/articleshow/88886241.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Covid-19: At PM’s meet, Maharashtra govt seeks mandatory vaccination||MUMBAI: Raising its demand for additional Covid-19 vaccines, the Maharashtra government on Thursday also asked the Centre to consider making vaccination mandatory for everyone as a solution to vaccine hesitancy. “We have sought 90 lakh additional doses – 40 lakh of Covaxin and 50 lakh of Covishield to complete the vaccination of those in the 15-18 age group and also administer the precautionary dose to the eligible population. We have asked the Centre to consider making vaccination mandatory to address hesitancy and to ensure speedy vaccination for all,” said State Health Minister Rajesh Tope. Maharashtra government has been struggling to increase its speed of vaccination and has taken several steps to bring it on par with the national average but many districts still continue to be on the bottom of the ladder. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday held a virtual meeting with all the chief ministers on the backdrop of the rising Covid-19 cases. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray could not participate in the meeting due to his ill health, and the health minister represented the state. Although, Maharashtra did not get a chance to speak in the meeting all the demands by the state have been sent to the Centre in writing, said Tope. “Vaccination is the biggest weapon to slow down the surge and the Centre must come out with a policy to address hesitancy,” said Tope. The state has also raised the issue of unreported test results due to home-testing kits. “Lakhs of home-testing kits are being sold in the state but test results are not being communicated to the state. There has to be a mechanism in place to ensure that every positive result gets recorded in the system. At the state level we have called for more regulation at the pharmacy level," said Tope.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/at-pms-meet-state-seeks-mandatory-vaccination/articleshow/88886242.cms||---

The BMC's epidemiology cell will follow up with kit buyers to ensure they upload their test results.  Under the Epidemic Act, 1897 and Disaster Management Act.2005, Chahal said that manufacturers and distributors of home testing antigen kits shall have to email information of the number of kits sold to the medicine stores to FDA commissioner. Similarly, chemists have to upload their daily sale details, containing the bill and details of the buyer, to the FDA commissioner by 6pm every day.  The data related to the kits that will be received through email from manufacturers, distributors and medical stores will be monitored by the epidemiology cell that will further forward it to the concerned ward officials.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/self-test-kits-producers-told-to-share-sales-data/articleshow/88886243.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Districts with low Covid-19 vaccination coverage could see Omicron behave differently, say experts||MUMBAI: A dozen districts in Maharashtra with two-dose vaccination below 50% may encounter a very different version of Omicron than the picture emerging from Mumbai and Pune that have saturated immunisation coverage, warn experts. They have cautioned these districts to not fall for the “mild” narrative and instead vaccinate the remaining population with both jabs promptly.  The fast-spreading Omicron variant, so far, has largely been found in the state’s urban hubs, with 78.5% of the cases being confirmed from Mumbai and Pune districts. These places haven’t witnessed critical cases or deaths among the Omicron affected. While both have over 100% single-dose coverage, Mumbai has fully vaccinated 90% and Pune 80.5%. By contrast, as many as 12 districts have covered less than 50% people with two shots.  The tribal-populated Nandurbar is at the bottom having vaccinated merely 42% with both shots. Many others, including Nanded, Akola and Beed, have managed to double vaccinate just 43%-45%. The same districts also have less than 80% first dose coverage. Across Maharashtra, 1.2 crore people are unvaccinated. While big districts such as Thane and Nashik lead the chart with 11 lakh and 8.5 lakh unvaccinated population, smaller ones such as Nandurbar, Nanded and Beed also have an unvaccinated population of 4 lakh to 6 lakh. “While Omicron causes less severe disease than Delta, it remains a dangerous virus, particularly for those who are unvaccinated,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Wednesday, cautioning nations from allowing the virus a “free ride”. Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray warned on Wednesday that the infection was once again spreading to rural areas and asked people to get vaccinated.  Dr Subhash Salunkhe, a member of the national Covid task force, said the new variant could certainly behave differently in unvaccinated, partially vaccinated pockets or areas where the exposure of first and second waves has been low. A state official said cases typically start in Mumbai and Pune and move towards Satara, Sangli, Ahmednagar, Beed, Nashik; most are seeing a rise. “It will be risky if districts with poor vaccination coverage and suboptimal medical manpower underplay Omicron based on the outcome of patients in Mumbai and Pune,” an official said. Accounts of US doctors show Covid-19 appears to behave differently in the vaccinated and the unvaccinated.

An estimated 30% drop in air passengers is expected in the final quarter of this fiscal, according to aviation observers. On January 11 – a Tuesday, usually the leanest day of the week – the daily traffic dipped to 1.8 lakh, shows ministry of civil aviation data. It’s a huge drop when compared to the traffic seen in the past two months. From November 6, 2021 to January 3, over 3 lakh domestic passengers boarded flights every single day. “An analysis of traffic data of top four private airports – Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad – which accounted for about 90% of air traffic handled by private airports and about 50% of all passenger traffic last fiscal, indicates that Omicron could push air traffic recovery into fiscal 2024,” said credit rating company CRISIL. Manish Gupta, senior director, CRISIL, said, “Both personal and business travel will take a hit in January and February, leading to air traffic plunging an estimated 30% sequentially in the last quarter of this fiscal.” tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/domestic-airtraffic-drops-37-since-january-1/articleshow/88886245.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Daily Covid cases drop 17% in Mumbai, 1% in Maharashtra||MUMBAI: After Wednesday's high Covid tally, the state and the city reported dips in new cases. While the city reported a nearly 17% drop in its daily caseload, the state's decline was insignificant at less than 1%. Maharashtra reported 46,406 cases as against 46,723 on Wednesday, while the city reported 13,702 cases as against over 16,000 on Wednesday. Worryingly, Covid fatalities in the state reported a surge for the third consecutive day. The state reported 36 deaths, of which 6 were from the city.  The daily tally of the Omicron-Covid wave in Mumbai has been a topic of debate, with some doctors stating that the curve is flattening, while ministers said the worst is yet to come for Maharashtra in terms of caseload. On Thursday, Dr Rahul Pandit, who is a member of the state government’s task force on Covid-19, said that if cases continue to drop for the next three to four days, the worst could be over for the city. “General practitioners, who are the first level of contact for patients, are reporting a drop in calls and consultations,” he said.  Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said, “We will assess the situation for another three to four days before making up our mind on whether the wave is declining.” Kakani said that citizens have no need to panic. “Over 80% of public hospital beds for Covid are vacant. In the private sector too, over 65% of beds are vacant. Most people are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms,” said Kakani. Dr Gautam Bhansali, a member of the state Covid task force, said the third wave is peaking. “In a week or two, decline should be apparent,” he said.  Health minister Rajesh Tope said on Thursday that of the nearly 4,000 samples sent for genome sequencing in the state, 1,300 have been detected with the Omicron variant, while the remaining 2,700 are still of the Delta variant. “70% cases from the sample were of the Delta variant and so we shouldn't be worried only about the Omicron variant. We have to continue masking and following all Covid-appropriate norms,” said Tope.  Senior officials said a large number of cases are now getting reported from cities like Thane, Navi Mumbai, Panvel, Nashik, and Nagpur. “Even if cases in Mumbai report a decline, cases have just started to rise in other cities. Once the wave starts surging in unvaccinated areas, there could be a rise in hospitalisation,” said the official. Meanwhile, MNS MLA Pramod (Raju) Patil has once again tested positive for Covid. Patil’s RT-PCR test report on Thursday came positive. MNS leader Harshad Patil said, “Patil has mild symptoms and is undergoing treatment in home isolation under guidance of a doctor from RR Hospital, Dombivli.” In the second wave, Patil and his wife had tested positive.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/daily-covid-cases-drop-17-in-mum-1-in-maha/articleshow/88886248.cms||Bhavika Jain

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Shiv Sena MLA Pratap Sarnaik given Rs 4.3 crore waiver despite objection by finance department||MUMBAI: The MVA government’s decision to waive penalty and interest worth Rs 4.3 crore imposed on illegal floors in a complex in Thane owned by Shiv Sena MLA Pratap Sarnaik overrode strong objections raised by the state finance department. The finance department had, in fact, suggested levying twice the penalty to make the case a deterrent for others. The waiver was given in a state cabinet meeting on Wednesday. The proposal for the waiver was moved by the urban development department, a portfolio held by the Shiv Sena. It was passed without discussion in the cabinet. Sarnaik is currently facing an ED probe on charges of money laundering. Sources say the state finance department had objected to the waiver, saying it would serve as a precedent for other unauthorised constructions to apply for a similar waiver. The finance department said the construction was undertaken without permission and a penalty must be levied. It also suggested that since the irregularity was serious, the urban development department should consider levying double the penalty so it could serve as a deterrent to others. The finance department also said that the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) would lose revenue if the penalty was waived. The case relates to the Chhabhaiya Vihang Garden — two 13-storey buildings developed by companies controlled by Sarnaik. They were given permission to construct up to 9 floors in 2008. Sarnaik, however, had built a school for the TMC and received construction TDR (transfer of development rights) for this. He later went on to use the construction TDR generated by the school construction to build four additional storeys in the Chhabhaiya Vihang Garden buildings without seeking clearance for this from the TMC. BJP MLA Kirit Somaiya had complained to the Lokayutka about the case. The UD department’s proposal says Sarnaik had received permission for constructing a school for TMC in exchange for construction TDR in 2008. In 2013, he received construction TDR of 2,163 square metres. Another 544.7 square metres of construction TDR was yet to be given. However, without seeking the TMC’s permission, he utilised 2,089 square metres of construction TDR to build additional floors of Chhabhaiya Vihang Garden to make them 13-storeyed buildings. He then applied for regularisation. The permission was given in 2013 with a penalty of Rs 3.3 crore to be paid in 6 months, failing which an interest of 18% was to be levied. A sum of Rs 25 lakh was later deposited with the TMC. But even then, a sum of Rs 3.08 crore in penalty and Rs 1.25 crore in interest was still pending. In its proposal, the UD department said that the case was an exception since the unauthorised construction had used construction TDR granted to the developer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/sena-mla-given-4-3cr-waiver-despite-objection-by-fin-dept/articleshow/88886251.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

The ‘S’ band radar can track weather up to 500km radius. Doppler radar made an entry into the weather bureau after 26 July 2005, when the city received 944mm of unannounced rainfall that led to a deluge.The second radar, which is a ‘C’ band, has been installed on land provided by BMC and is meant to facilitate improvement in weather forecasting over Mumbai region. In June last year, IMD had begun experimental trials for it. The IMD shared images of the same on its official website back then and said that these were ‘uncalibrated’ images. Officials said that so far it was being used only by their office to give them additional inputs. This ‘C’ band radar provides surveillance over a radial range of 450km around Mumbai. IMD said it’s been fabricated in India under ‘Make in India’ policy. —Richa Pinto||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/city-to-get-2nd-doppler-radar-to-monitor-weather-today/articleshow/88886252.cms||---

We should refrain from such things,” said Shahid. “President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih’s foreign policy is a balanced policy,” he added, while speaking to a local news agency. Asked about the ‘India Out’ campaign and the alleged support from China, Shahid reiterated that it will be most beneficial for a nation like Maldives, which has a small economy, to exist in unison with all countries which uphold “international values and principles” and have an interest in diplomatic ties with Maldives. This, he said, included India and China. “However, it will not benefit the country to take advantage of domestic disputes and target countries,” he added. Shahid stated that close relations with India and the assistance being provided had always remained the same regardless of which party was in power in Male. “It was during President Maumoon’s administration that the nation came under terrorist attack and when Tsunami crisis hit. Male’s water crisis happened during President Yameen’s administration. And President Ibrahim Solih is governing when aid has been provided during Covid-19 pandemic,” said Shahid, adding India had provided assistance during each one of these crises.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maldives-tries-to-put-an-end-to-india-out-campaign/articleshow/88886202.cms||---

He said Lande circulated videos showing Khan as anti-national. Khan alleged that 48 hours before the day of election, Lande, party chief Uddhav Thackeray and Anil Parab campaigned in Chandivli and committed electoral offences.  Lande, through his counsel Shardul Singh, sought rejection of petition based on “conjecture’’. His application said the petition lacked ‘material facts’.Justice Sandeep Shinde held that Khan”failed to plead material facts’’ and hence his petition was rejected. The HC judgment said, “To get an election declared as void …, the election petitioner must aver that,’’ that due to “non-compliance with provisions of the Constitution or of this (Representation of People) Act’’ the election result of winner is affected. —Swati Deshpande||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/plea-against-mla-who-won-chandivli-seat-rejected-in-hc/articleshow/88886254.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: BMC to save up Rs 136 crore after BJP blows whistle||MUMBAI: After BMC re-floated tenders for trenching contracts, it will save around Rs 136 crore. Companies which had bid above BMC’s estimates have now bid an average of 25% below estimate for trenching work after BMC scrapped tenders and re-invited them over allegations of rigging and cartelisation. BMC had scrapped tenders for trenching work worth Rs 569 crore. It decided to cancel the tenders after a probe found circumstantial evidence that tenders could have been rigged. BJP had predicted winning bids and the same companies later won tenders at similar rates in November. BJP corporator Vinod Mishra had alleged rigging of BMC’s tenders for utility trenching, which Mishra said has led to a loss of Rs 188 crore to BMC. He had, in a letter to BMC chief Iqbal Chahal and mayor Kishori Pednekar, named nine contractors who would get the contract for trenching. Days later, the same contractors won the bids at the price mentioned in Mishra’s letter. BMC had re-floated the tenders for trenching and in the new tenders the total cost of works is now around Rs 433 crore where companies have bid around 22% to 27% below estimates. In previous tenders, companies had bid around 3% to 8% above estimates, inflating the cost. Mishra claimed it was a bog victory as BMC would save Rs 136 crore after BJP’s complaint. He said asphalt and mastic ready-mix plant owners colluded with each other and rigged the bidding process. “Even before financial bids were opened, it was decided who would bag the tenders and I had shared a list of the names too. Due to restrictive and arbitrary condition of getting an undertaking from asphalt and mastic plant owners, a cartel was formed by crony contractors,” he said. “In August the tender amount for the same work was around Rs 380 crore, then it became Rs 569 crore in November. Now the same works are costing Rs 433 crore. The Vigilance department probe report must be made public and the Vigilance department must check the bank accounts of all companies and owners since they all moved money from each other’s accounts to pay the deposits for these tenders,” Mishra said. BMC appoints contractors to fill up trenches dug up on footpaths and roads to lay cables and underground pipes for utilities like electricity, gas and telephone lines.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/bmc-to-save-up-136cr-after-bjp-blows-whistle/articleshow/88886258.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

His 60 days of custody got over on January 1, 2022, and the next day he had filed default bail plea, which is a provision under section 167 of the CrPC wherein if the investigation is not complete by then, he can seek bail. His counsel said since no cognizance of chargesheet was taken and court had not declared that investigation was complete, he was entitled to such bail. But additional Solicitor general Anil Singh while making his submissions for the ED via video conferencing submitted that there was no requirement in law for such cognizance to be taken once chargesheet is filed which had been filed in the case on December 27, 2021. Hence his plea be rejected, he said.

WR had earlier estimated the work to be completed above the track in April 2020 but because of the lockdown it could not meet the deadline. Later, the deadline was revised to August 2020 which could not be adhered to as WR had claimed that oxygen was unavailable for fabrication work as its supply was diverted for medical use. A senior WR official said, “There have been minor changes in design. Besides, it is not easy to undertake work as the same pace once the entire planning gets disturbed mid-way because of Covid-related issues.” TIMES VIEWTraffic snarls have only got worse around Dadar, Parel, Currey Road and Lalbaug because reconstruction of this ROB has been inordinately delayed. Although thepandemic may have pushed back the deadline, railways and BMC must now show a sense of urgency and finish the crucial project soon.WR’s chief PRO Sumit Thakur said, “We expect the work to be completed in our portion by June 2022.” BMC had earlier stated that it would require another year after WR’s completion of work to finish work on approaches. Earlier, BMC had hoped to complete this by May 2022 but now that WR’s work is delayed, the bridge is expected to open in early2023. The ROB was shut after it was declared unsafe by a team of IIT experts who were asked to check every overhead structure crossing the railway tracks after the collapse of Gokhale bridge at Andheri in July the same year. WR took up dismantling of span over railway tracks in 2019. Work to rebuild railway portion of ROB began in November 2019.

---||Mumbai||Most med edu aspirants from Pune, Ahmednagar close 2nd||Mumbai: Pune has seen the largest cohort of 4,656 candidates aspiring to join medical education this year. With 4,045 aspirants, Ahmednagar is surprisingly a close second and Nagpur comes third with 3,672. If Mumbai and Mumbai suburban are added, though, they top the charts at 4,936.Class 12 graduates who registered to participate in the medical and dental admission in Maharashtra saw another 1,116 out-of-state aspirants who would like to join medical schools in this state. While the CET cell has extended the deadline for registration to January 17, it merely expects the tally to go up by about 100-odd students. Experts say since the last five years, Mumbai students’ interest in professional education has been on the wane. “Not only are the registration numbers high from Pune, we also see that students from there are topping the charts with regards to their scores in the past two years,” said Dr T P Lahane, former head of the Directorate of Medical Education and Research. Pune aced the charts ever since NEET was introduced in 2013 and Latur, the traditional topper, has slid from its pole position since then. Latur has 2,433 applicants for undergraduate medical and dental admissions.Former DMER head Dr Pravin Shingare said Ahmednagar had never been so high up on the list. “In recent past, after Pune, we would see the second largest numbers from Thane and Mumbai suburban. But now coaching centres from Kota have opened in Ahmednagar. Earlier, they would have sub-centres in Pune, Nagpur, Mumbai and Thane. And students from Ahmednagar used to come to these cities. But with the growing numbers, these coaching classes have started centres in Ahmednagar too,” reasoned Dr Shingare.CET cell commissioner R S Jagtap said he noticed that aspirations of students from the interior pockets of the state were on the rise. “It is heartening to see that larger numbers from several corners of the state are opting for professional education, including medicine and dentistry,” said Jagtap.A total of 59,647 candidates have, till date, registered for undergraduate admissions to health science courses, including MBBS and dental (BDS). In 2019, a total of 59,000 candidates had registered in Maharashtra and last year, a total of 64,645 candidates had signed up when registration counters closed.

The first round of winter harvest festivals began with Lohri and will peak as various communities celebrate Makar Sankranti, Pongal and Bihu over Friday and Saturday.As the Sun enters Capricorn at Uttarayan January 14, fasting devotees take a dip in holy rivers, make offerings to the Sun god, light bonfires, give food to underprivileged persons, children, animals and birds, fly kites and partake of sweet foods cooked with sesame seeds and jaggery like 'til gul'.According to Drikpanchang.com Mumbai's Makar Sankranti moment occurs at 2.43pm Friday. The maha punya kaal continues till 4.34pm while the punya kaal spans 2.43-6.21pm.Kite flying is the signature celebration across western India, particularly Gujarat and Maharashtra. Ahmed Kazi, who owns Lucky Bharat Kite Shop near Bandra station, says business has dropped to 60% of pre-Covid levels. “More than the fear of the pandemic, it is the loss of jobs and economic slump that is keeping youth from their pastime. Prices have risen 20% because transportation, sticks and paper are all costlier. We sell kites ranging from Rs 3-50 apiece and the favourites are those that cost Rs 8-10.” His wife Naseem says cartoon characters like Chhota Bheem rule the roost.One of the oldest manufacturers Ahsan Shaban Khan of the 65-year-old Bombay Umbrella and Kites in Bhendi Bazar, says, “We stocked merely 50% of our regular volume given the uncertainty caused by Covid. People are not sure of the timing restrictions, and some are calling to ask if the shop is open." Tamilians celebrate four days of the Pongal festival. "Due to the Covid scare, for the second year in a row there will not be a mass Pongal celebration at Dharavi," said local resident Ravi Nadar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/covid-curfew-dampens-harvest-festivities/articleshow/88886269.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Cyber cheats dupe bizman of Rs 2 lakh||Mumbai: A businessman was recently duped of Rs 2 lakh by cyberfraudsters who were posing as military hospital staff wanting to order ECG machines. The Goregaon police have registered an FIR and are probing further. The 54-year-old complainant manufactures bio-medical equipment. The businessman told police that for deliveries to be made to government departments, he has to make a payment of 10% of the tender amount for getting the order. He gets back this amount a year later, the complainant told the police. The businessman said on December 8, someone identifying himself as Kuldeep Singh called him, and said he worked at a military hospital in Santacruz. He expressed interest in purchasing five ECG machines. The businessman spoke to Kuljeet and was told that another military hospital staffer, Manjeet Singh, would be dealing with him from now on. A while later, a man called up and identified himself as Manjeet. He asked the businessman to make a transaction of Rs 5 to his bank account as a test. When the businessman did so, he received an amount of Rs 10. The fraudster then asked the businessman to send him Rs 80,000. He claimed that the businessman would get back Rs 79,995 after deduction of Rs 5, but nothing was returned. “Claiming a technical error, the accused sent businessman two links, and asked him to click those to receive the money. The links were of a digital wallet. When the businessman did so, Rs 1.2 lakh got debited from his account,” police said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/cyber-cheats-dupe-bizman-of-2-lakh/articleshow/88886271.cms||---

An interim oral assurance given by the public prosecutor not to take any coercive steps against him would continue till Monday when the order is to be pronounced. Rane, a BJP MLA, is seeking protection against arrest in connection with an attempt to murder case registered in Sindhudurg. His senior counsel Niteen Pradhan had argued before Justice C V Bhadang that invoking an offence of attempt to murder was “preposterous”, and that the charge was only an “outcome of lampooning” that Aditya Thackeray had faced outside the Vidhan Bhavan last month when BJP leaders were protesting. Special public prosecutor Sudeep Pasbola, however, argued that arrested co-accused Sachin Satpute was a close associate of Rane and his statement reveals that all co-accused, except Rane, were in telephonic contact with each other and the police have the call data record.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/hc-order-on-nitesh-ranes-bail-on-mon/articleshow/88886272.cms||Swati Deshpande

Damania said since the anti-corruption bureau (ACB) has not challenged the discharge order dated September 9, 2021, passed by the special sessions court judge for cases against politicians, she was moving the HC as her “duty as an activist”. Her criminal revision application said she had also filed an intervention application to oppose the discharge plea filed by Bhujbal before the trial court. She said that a public interest litigation (PIL) in 2014 “had raised allegations of rampant corruption on part of the respondent accused and pointed towards irregularities in the sale of FSI of non-slum plot of Regional Transport Office at Andheri and construction contract of New Maharashtra Sadan given to M/s K S Chamankar. The PIL had stated that the contract was awarded without inviting tenders and kickbacks were received (by Bhujbal and his family members) from the developer for this project.” On perusing documents placed by Damania on record in the PIL, the HC had on December 18, 2014, directed constituting a special investigation team (SIT) comprising director general, ACB Mumbai, and Enforcement Directorate (ED) director to conduct a detailed inquiry. Damania’s application says the sessions court discharge judgement “erroneously concluded” that there is “no meeting of minds of the accused public servants and there was no conspiracy hatched to prepare status report favourable to the developer.” She said, the sessions court judgement has been passed without appreciating the fact that the charge about preparation of feasibility report favourable to developer was primarily on the basis of miscalculation, misrepresentation and fudging of financial figures in estimating profit to the developer. Damania’s application will be heard in due course.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/activist-moves-hc-against-min-bhujbal-in-maha-sadan-scam/articleshow/88886276.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Adani enters steel biz with $5bn Posco pact||Mumbai: Billionaire industrialist Gautam Adani’s infrastructure conglomerate and South Korea’s Posco have inked a $5-billion (nearly Rs 37,000-crore) pact for setting up an integrated steel complex in the former’s home state of Gujarat. This would put the Adani Group in direct competition with Tata Steel, JSW Steel and ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel. The conglomerate, which is India’s largest player in ports and renewable energy, has been making moves for a play in the metals sector. Last month, it incorporated a new arm for aluminium and, before that, it announced a foray into copper. The pact with Adani, one of India’s most powerful business houses, will fulfil Posco’s long-held ambition of having a large steel mill in the country.Posco had looked to set up a $12-billion steel unit in Odisha. But the project ran into rough weather due to delays in getting mining rights for iron ore (a key raw material in steel making) and opposition from locals in acquiring land. This time around, Adani would bring land in Mundra, Gujarat to the table for the plant for hot-rolled steel (used in construction). Mundra houses Adani’s port, power and processed food facilities. Posco, on the other hand, will bring its steel-making prowess to the alliance. The South Korean company, the world’s sixth-largest steel maker, already runs a 1.8-million-ton mill in Maharashtra for cold-rolled steel (used in home appliances and automobiles). Besides, it has four processing centres in the country.Adani is likely to hold a majority stake in the steel venture with Posco, which will mark its entry into the sector. Apart from steel, Adani will collaborate with Posco to explore opportunities covering renewable energy, hydrogen and logistics industries in response to carbon-reduction requirements, the Indian conglomerate said, without spelling out details. Adani is making a $20-billion push into green energy to make its businesses a net-zero carbon emitter by 2030.The Adani-Posco steel venture could leverage on the Indian conglomerate’s logistics and renewable energy infrastructure in Mundra, industry sources said. For instance, the steel plant could source power from Adani and the latter would get a captive customer in the alloy maker.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/adani-enters-steel-biz-with-5bn-posco-pact/articleshow/88886279.cms||Reeba Zachariah
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka lost 64 sqkm of moderately dense forest in 2 years: Report||BENGALURU: Karnataka has lost 64 sqkm moderately dense forest, a type that accounts for 54% of the overall forest ar-ea in the state, according to the 2021 India State of Forests Report (ISFR) released on Thursday. This is in comparison to the findings of 2019 report. The overall addition of 155 sqkm of forest areas — mostly in the open-forest category — by Karnataka pales in comparison with the 1,000 sqkm the state had added in the previous survey period. Despite the addition, the total forest cover in the state is only 20.2% of its geographical area, which is much lesser than the global prescription of at least 33% and the national average of 21.7%. While the growth registered by Karnataka was the highest in the country in 2019, the relatively small increase this year still puts the state among the top five. As per ISFR-2021, states that reported the most growth are Andhra Pradesh (647 sqkm), Telangana (632 sqkm), Odisha (537 sqkm), Karnataka and Jharkhand (110 sqkm). "The gain in forest cover may be attributed to better conservation steps, protection, afforestation activities, tree plantation drives and agroforestry," the report reads. Very dense, open forest cover increaseBased on satellite data, the report puts Karnataka's total forest cover at 38,730 sqkm compared to 38,575 sqkm during the previous survey period, with a growth of 0.4%. Comparatively, India's total forest cover is 7.13 lakh sqkm having recorded a 0.2% (1,540 sqkm) jump from 7.12 lakh sqkm previously. Of the 38,730 sqkm forest cover in Karnataka, very dense forest and open forest cover have increased, while moderately dense forest cover has shrunk. Very dense forest cover increased by 32 sqkm to 4,533 sqkm; open forest cover jumped by 186 sqkm to 13,212 sqkm. However, the decrease of 64 sqkm in moderately dense forest cover cover has offset the spike in open forest cover and reduced the overall increase. The decrease in forest cover, as per the report, can be attributed to "...shifting cultivation, felling of trees, natural calamities, anthropogenic (human) pressure and developmental activities". Further, the report shows that out of the 38,730 sqkm total forest cover in the state, 446 sqkm is outside "recorded forest area". This mainly comprises reserved forests and protected forests. This means the forest cover within recorded forest area is only 38,284 sqkm, which is under 20% of the total geographical area of the state.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/report-ktaka-lost-64-sqkm-of-moderately-dense-forest-in-2yrs/articleshow/88886280.cms||Chethan Kumar

Kumar has proposed a strategy of deploying ‘bionic’ agents by extending tech support in the form of digital tools and analytics to the agency force.The LIC chairman said that the millennial segment was seeking a superior experience and this called for insurers to reimagine their journey & process, and partnering insuretech companies to achieve this was an opportunity. “Insurers need to explore partnerships with large digital platforms, creating win-win models,” said Kumar. This would be possible by insurance companies deploying a sales force of bionic agents by equipping agents with next-generation tools.

---||Bengaluru||After Karnataka HC rap & on Rahul Gandhi nudge, Congress suspends padayatra||BENGALURU: A day after the Karnataka high court slammed the state government for allowing a rally amid rising Covid cases and following intervention from the party bosses, Congress on Thursday suspended its 11-day padayatra from Mekedatu to Bengaluru on its fifth day. The 168-km padayatra to press for implementation of the Mekedatu drinking water project started on January 9 from Sangama, the confluence of Cauvery and Arkavati rivers, in Mekedatu in Ramanagara district. The yatra was scheduled to conclude on January 19 with a huge rally in Bengaluru. Following the court's rap, the state government late Wednesday night imposed stringent restrictions on participation in the yatra, which was attended by thousands of people with little or no regard for Covid guidelines. "We've decided to suspend the padayatra respecting the court's opinion and caring for the people's health. We'll resume the yatra from Ramanagara to Bengaluru once Covid cases subside and the government lifts related restrictions," said KPCC chief DK Shivakumar. Opposition leader Siddaramaiah said the Congress is a responsible party, which counts public health as important. AICC leader Rahul Gandhi reportedly spoke to Shivakumar and advised him on taking an immediate decision considering the optics about the padayatra. Siddaramaiah said: "We've made the decision not out of fear of cases being filed against us." Sources said the decision was also prompted by a directive of the party command, which felt the yatra was earning negative points especially after the high court's observation. Randeep Singh Surjewala, general secretary in charge of Karnataka, asked the Karnataka unit chief to stop the padayatra since it was threatening to give adverse publicity to the party ahead of elections to five crucial States. At a meeting in Ramanagara earlier in the day, Congress functionaries were divided over stopping the padayatra midway. Some leaders, including Shivakumar, favoured a truncated padayatra with a few leaders walking to Bengaluru to prevent crowding and ensure adherence to Covid-19 norms. "Had we gone ahead with the plan, police would have arrested us and forcefully ended the yatra. It would have given BJP an opportunity to claim credit for stopping the yatra. Moreover, the party would have faced strictures from the court and faced serious embarrassment," said a leader who attended the meeting. On Wednesday, the high court rapped the state government for its inaction to stop the yatra and asked Congress to clarify if it had obtained permission for the yatra and was following Covid protocol. The court will hear the case on Friday. Following the rap, the state government on Wednesday night banned the padayatra and prohibited movement of people and vehicles into Ramanagara. Officials had pasted a notice on the wall of the residence of DK Shivakumar after he refused to receive it alleging a Covid-infected official had issued it.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/after-hc-rap-on-rahul-nudge-congress-suspends-padayatra/articleshow/88886285.cms||---

Investors are mostly endowments and others based in the US.Recognize has made three investments, in UK-based digital engineering firm Ciklum, US-based premier Google Cloud partner SpringML, and virtual talent platform Torc. Recognize marries tech innovators in cloud, agile, mobile, IoT to enterprise outcomes, including customer retention, engagement, customer acquisition, and revenue cycle management. D’Souza said the technology services market is 3.5 times larger than the software industry, yet the sector has only attracted one-third of the amount of private equity capital.“We seek to make a majority investment in businesses that are somewhere between $100 million -$500 million in revenue, and we take a majority stake in the business. We work alongside the management team, and provide access to our relationships with clients, and operating best practices to help companies scale and innovate. We have access to deep tech talent networks that we bring to our portfolio companies. Our investors have patient capital and we believe in long-term value creation,” said D’Souza. D’Souza had a phenomenal run as CEO of Cognizant, growing the company tenfold from $1.4 billion in 2006 to $16 billion in 2018, when he stepped down. Headcount during that period grew from 39,000 to over 2.8 lakh employees, and Cognizant entered the Fortune 200. During his tenure, the company’s revenue crossed those of Infosys and Wipro.D’Souza cofounded Recognize along with Raj Mehta, former Cognizant president, Charles Phillips, former chairman and CEO of enterprise SaaS company Infor, and former president of Oracle, and David Wasserman, a former partner at private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice. Recognize, he said, will focus on areas that are tech-intensive, including healthcare, e-commerce, and retail. “We want to build high-skilled businesses,” he said. D’Souza said remote work models have evolved and it’s only going to accelerate. “The rise of India was in some sense the first movement of tech work. We are going to see another generation going forward in a far more distributed way than we have seen in the past and the pandemic has just accelerated that.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/former-cognizant-ceo-dsouzas-fund-raises-1-3bn/articleshow/88886316.cms||Shilpa Phadnis

We have grown 3%, very much in line with our guidance, which was 2-4%. In the last four quarters, we have grown 28% (year-on-year). We are the fastest growing firm in the industry. Even organically, we have a high double-digit growth, and we will never look at M&A to compensate for the lack of organic growth.The demand environment is robust, but IT companies have a major attrition issue. How are you addressing this?We see some moderation and stabilisation emerging in the next few quarters. We are a lot more organised now to deal with this level of attrition. We have hired more employees than ever. We have added 50,000 net new additions over the last five quarters, which is unique in the history of the organisation. We have multiple touchpoints with employees, and communicate more on culture and values. The more we increase emotional connect, we increase the chances of their being willing to stay and invest in their careers with Wipro.You said at the press conference that your win rates have gone up by 300 basis points. Can you explain that?Win rate is the difference between the size of the pipeline and the volume of business that you convert into a win. If the pipeline is filled with opportunities that are far from being closed, if they are clients you don’t know well, if they are in areas where you have limited expertise, then you know that you can’t win. We don’t want our teams to spend time on winning an impossible deal. The quality of the pipeline is pretty good now. The higher the win rate is, the lower the cost of winning a deal is.You said you’ve had a great turnaround story in Europe…Between 2010-2020, and not counting the time of the pandemic, there was zero growth in Europe. We have totally changed the model, we have put an organisation in place, chosen markets that are a priority in Europe, we have appointed CEOs in each of the markets, hired senior leaders. It's paying off. In Germany, we have doubled in size in four quarters. The growth in south Europe, UK, Switzerland, the Nordic countries is good as well.Pricing for in-demand skills has risen by 4%-7%. How are clients absorbing price increases, and how are companies like yours managing the talent pyramid?Most clients are less focused on price and are more focused on speed of delivery and quality. We have been able to raise our prices in many instances over the last 2-3 quarters and I expect this trend to continue.Last fiscal, your operating margins were in the 19%-20% range. Is has dropped to 17%-18%?There is the 2% that comes from the cost of acquisitions. We have stayed within the normal bands. We are also constantly improving our model and driving efficiency and reinvesting in our talent and processes. We have onboarded more than 70 new VPs (vice presidents) over the last 12 months. We are making a $1 billion investment into the cloud, we are investing in cyber security. Clients want to accelerate their digital transformation. How are you leveraging tech and skills to improve speed and execution?We are not waiting for them to come with a plan. We are being proactive. We are spending time to explain how tech can help improve growth, productivity, and profitability. Our clients across industries are aware of it. We are committing to the outcome. Our job is to mitigate and take the risk away from them.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/wipros-win-rate-up-great-turnaround-in-europe/articleshow/88886317.cms||Sujit John

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Water flows into parties’ agenda ahead of 2023 polls||BENGALURU: Politics in Karnataka has revolved around rivers — Cauvery, Krishna and Mahadayi — in the recent past. Warming up for the assembly elections, scheduled for early next year, all three major parties are looking to use water as a trump card over other burning topics such as inflation, employment and rural distress. The issue of water has remained on the back burner despite tall promises made by parties in the run-up to the 2018 assembly polls, but has come to the centre stage again and is likely to find a mention in the election manifestos of BJP, Congress and JD(S). While Congress launched a padayatra — which is now suspended — pressing for implementation of the Mekedatu drinking water project, JD(S) will launch Jaladhare Ratha on January 26 to highlight the “injustice” meted out to Karnataka by both the state and central governments in implementing irrigation projects. The ruling BJP is betting big on getting clearance for the long-pending Mekedatu and Kalasa-Banduri (Mahadayi) projects months before the polls and on laying greater emphasis on implementation of the Centre’s flagship Jal Jeevan Mission that aims to provide water tap connections in rural areas. Sapna Nagaraj, a water expert, said, “While water has always been considered critical for economic and social lives, now it is so for political survival as well.” Quoting India’s waterman Rajendra Singh, she said, “Besides quenching the thirst of people, water also fetches votes.” A voter priority Data shows that the importance of water issues for voters has increased significantly in recent years. This was emphasised in an all-India survey conducted by Association for Democratic Reforms on governance issues and voting behaviour in 2018 across 534 Lok Sabha constituencies, involving over 2.7 lakh respondents. Drinking water was third, after better employment opportunities and better healthcare, on the list of top priorities. Legislators and their political rivals vie with each other to provide drinking water in their constituencies. Almost every MLA and prospective candidate prefers addressing drinking water issues even by spending money from their own pockets. Emotional issueSome political observers say the Congress is raking up Mekedatu as it’s an emotional issue for people, especially farmers on state borders. They also say long-winded legal battles have been used as political currency in the past as well to deflect attention from other issues.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/water-flows-into-parties-agenda-ahead-of-2023-polls/articleshow/88886320.cms||Manu Aiyappa

The accused is Manjunath, a bar bender, while the deceased is Manjula, who worked as housekeeping staff at a private insurance company. According to police, Manjunath bludgeoned Manjula to death with a hammer on the night of January 6 and claimed she had fallen unconscious after drinking alcohol. He took her to Jayanagar General Hospital around 9.30am on January 7, where doctors declared her brought dead. As the doctors grew suspicious that she might have died a few hours earlier, Manjunath left the body and fled. Husband missingManjula, a mother of two, was living with Manjunath for the past two years. Her husband had gone missing from a hospital eight years ago and was never traced. Manjunath was suspicious about Manjula’s character and often fought with her over the matter. Around midnight on January 6, the couple argued over the same while under the influence of alcohol and Manjunath grabbed hold of a hammer and assaulted Manjula. He broke her legs and ribs. Manjula died of the injuries. The next morning, he approached his house owner to arrange an autorickshaw to the hospital, claiming that Manjula had fallen unconscious following excessive consumption of alcohol. Konanakunte police initially registered a case of suspicious death before changing it to murder charge after the autopsy report confirmed this be the case. Manjunath, also charged with destruction of evidence, was arrested on Wednesday. Further probe is on .||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/live-in-partner-tries-to-pass-off-womans-murder-as-alcohol-death/articleshow/88886321.cms||---

The lowest the mercury has touched is 14 degrees Celsius. The average minimum temperature for the past two weeks has been 17.6 degrees C, which is quite high given that the city had recorded 12 degrees C last winter. IMD officials attribute this to cloudy sky at night, too much moisture in the wind and increased humidity. Northerly and northeasterly winds bring in winter. But due to a change in the wind patterns, northerly wind has been cut off. Easterly wind is prevailing over the state and is known to pick up moisture and cause rainfall or increase humidity.  Officials say misty/foggy mornings are likely to continue till April. If the wind patterns change in the next two days, the temperature might dip a little. “But the position of the sun is likely to change in the next couple of days. Winter will soon come to an end and temperatures will start rising,” an official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/cloudy-nights-take-chill-out-of-winter/articleshow/88886322.cms||Mrinalini Bhat

---||Bengaluru||Bird lovers to kite flyers in Bengaluru: Avoid Chinese manja||BENGALURU: Weekend curfew may loom large over Sankranti celebrations but it can’t come in the way of Bengalureans’ major seasonal preoccupation: flying kites. If you plan to beat the curfew boredom and celebrate the festival by sending kites soaring up the skies from your terrace, here is an appeal from bird lovers: Don’t use Chinese manja thread. With the number of birds getting injured after being gashed by the manja thread bound to increase during and after the festival, activists have been emphasising the need to use non-lethal thread. Chinese manja, a mere string made lethal with a coating of powdered glass/metal, is commonly used by kite flyers, specially during this festival, to manoeuvre their gliders for sport. It has become the first choice, replacing traditional cotton strings, as it is cheap. The razor-sharp manja decomposes slowly. Even after the Karnataka government banned Chinese manja in 2017, it is still brazenly sold and purchased by people in the city despite several awareness campaigns and reports about its threat to all living beings. Wildlife activists say the calls for bird rescues peak post-Sankranti, particularly after the monsoon as birds search for safe spots on trees to breed and nest their young ones. “The birds fly around the trees looking for twigs and get entrapped in Chinese manja. We see a high incidence of such cases in areas where there are a lot of trees such as Cubbon Park, Lalbagh and Shivajinagar,” said Subiksha Venkatesh, rescue manager at Avian and Reptile Rehabilitation Centre (ARRC). ARRC alone reported 543 rescue operations in July 2021 and the reason was believed to be extra time in the hands of people during Covid curbs. The organisation has carried out 84 bird rescues since the start of January 2022. BBMP volunteers who take up 90% of the rescue calls in the city receive an average of 4-5 calls every day, regardless of the month. This, they say, is because of the prevalence of Chinese manja — a product that is unsuitable for the environment. “This is an imported product. Although overseas trade has been stopped to a large extent, it still remains in the storage of Indian traders who bring it to the streets every Sankranti,” said Mohan K, wildlife rescuer with BBMP Forest Cell. According to studies, the most vulnerable species are black kites and crows and the areas prone to such incidents are city centres where residential buildings are old, low-rise and traditionally built, and the areas are densely populated. Over 90% of the bird rescues are carried out on tree tops and this shows that most manjas end up in places where birds naturally perch or rest. Deadly for humans as well, Chinese manja can slit people’s throats. TOI had reported an incident last June, where a scooter-borne individual got entangled in the thread and suffered a deep cut on his neck requiring 15 stitches. Mohan said BBMP had given orders to seize the product if caught being sold to the public, but added that it is the responsibility of adults to educate themselves and their children and stop such purchase.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/bird-lovers-to-kite-flyers-avoid-chinese-manja/articleshow/88886324.cms||Sanika Athavale

The trench was neither barricaded nor surrounded with caution boards for motorists and pedestrians. The civic work being carried out there by Bengaluru Smart City Ltd commenced early last year. Frustrated Avenue Road traders said they have suffered enough losses because of the pandemic, but the delayed work is now threatening the safety of road users. Trade-activist Sajjan Raj Mehta said, “If the authorities were waiting for an accident to occur to give them a reason to finish their work, they finally have it. They can now go ahead and finish the work.” The accident occurred around 5pm on Wednesday. The biker escaped with minor injuries. Vimal Kanted, another trader, said, “The person happened to escape serious injuries by sheer luck. Many traders, workers and shoppers pulled him and his two-wheeler out of the trench. The work is progressing at a snail’s pace, but safety measures at least must be in place. This is unacceptable.” After hearing about the accident, Rajendra Cholan, MD of Bengaluru Smart City, visited the road on Thursday morning. “After inspecting the work, I have informed the contractor from BWSSB’s end also to ensure that all the required safety measures are taken. I agree that they should have been in place already.” “After the work on sewage lines is completed, we have to work on the pavements, which will take about 30 days. In total, it will take another 45 days. Work on the road should be completed by February-end,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/biker-falls-into-trench-without-barricades-on-avenue-road/articleshow/88886326.cms||Mrinalini Bhat
---||Bengaluru||HC upholds 10th std pass criteria for authorisation of PDS shops||Bengaluru: The high court has upheld the power and prerogative of the state government to impose conditions while considering the applications, under compassionate grounds, for grant of authorisation for setting up fair price shops under the public distribution system (PDS).“The condition of ‘pass in 10th standard’ is reasonable. The additional advocate general is also right in contending that a person who deals with commodity distribution is required to have basic knowledge in arithmetic, banking and liaison with public offices. The other conditions with regard to age is also a matter of policy and the same is just and appropriate. Advocates for the petitioners have not urged any cogent arguments as to how the condition of pass in ‘10th standard’ and the prescription of age is ultra vires the Constitution,” justice PS Dinesh Kumar observed in his order while disposing of a batch of petitions.However, the judge has granted relief strictly to the petitioners as “one-time measure” and the authorities have been told to consider their applications without insisting upon the age and educational qualification criteria stipulated under the rules.The ‘pass in 10th standard’ is a condition that has been consistently imposed in the notification dated June 10, 2016, amendment brought on May 20, 2017, and latest amendment brought on January 16, 2021. The latest amendment also stipulated that in case of death of an authorised dealer before attaining the age of 65, the authorisation can be transferred to his spouse who is aged less than 65 or unemployed son or unmarried daughter aged more than 18 or widowed daughter aged more than 18. Such transferees must have passed 10th standard or equivalent qualification as on the date of the death of the authorised dealer. So far, as the period of validity is concerned, it was three years in the notification dated June 10, 2016 and amendment dated May 20, 2017. It was substituted as five years in the amendment brought on March 17, 2020. The latest amendment, however, extended the period to 10 years.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/hc-upholds-10th-std-pass-criteria-for-authorisation-of-pds-shops/articleshow/88886327.cms||---

The one-day local holiday was announced in Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Pathanamthitta, Idukki, Palakkad and Wayanad districts.Earlier, Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin sent a letter, urging his Kerala counterpart Pinarayi Vijayan, to continue the practice of declaring January 14as a local holiday for the Pongal festival. He requested that a local holiday be declared for Pongal in six districts of Kerala where Tamil speaking people live in large numbers. While extending warm Pongal greetings to Tamils across the globe, Stalin, however, steered clear of any mention that his government would go back to a 2008 order issued by M Karunanidhi’s regime that the first day of ‘Thai’ (Pongal) would be celebrated as the Tamil New Year. The AIADMK government in 2011 passed a bill, making Tamil month ‘Chithirai’ as Tamil New Year. “This year's Pongal festival is a special one as the new (DMK) government has been formed,” Stalin said. He appealed to people to strictly follow Covid precautionary measures and celebrate the festival safely. Leaders of various political parties, including AIADMK coordinator O Panneerselvam, VCK leader Thol Thirumavalavan and BJP state president K Annamalai, have extended their Pongal greetings.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/pongal-holiday-in-6-kerala-dists-heeding-tn-cms-request/articleshow/88886336.cms||---

Thirty districts reported more than 100 new cases and among them Chennai, Chengalpet and Coimbatore had more than 1,000 new cases. Health secretary J Radhakrishnan said the week ahead will be crucial for the state as there will be an increase in inter-state and interdistrict travel, reunions and gatherings for Pongal. People from urban areas could take infection to rural areas and vice versa, he said. “Cases are likely to increase for a few more days,” he added. With 56 new cases, Ariyalur had the least number of new cases followed by Nagapattinam (57) and Mayiladuthurai (58).

Chennai reported 8,218 new cases, the highest number in a day since March 2020, while active cases in the state crossed 1 lakh after 210 days. Twenty-five deaths were reported on Thursday, the highest since October. On October 7, Tamil Nadu reported 27 deaths and the daily toll has been declining since then. Over the past four days, the total number of deaths in the state has been increasing though there is no change in the case fatality rate. The weekly average of deaths per day, which was around nine a day between Christmas and January 9, rose to 10 on January 10. From an average of 13 deaths a day on Wednesday, the 7-day average of deaths in the state has touched 15. The active cases, meanwhile, increased by nearly 16% in the past 24 hours to 1,03,610 on Thursday. On Wednesday, the state had 88,959 people in Covid isolation. The last time the state had more than 1 lakh people undergoing treatment was on June 17, 2021, when the second wave was receding. However, despite an increase in active case numbers, nearly 90% of hospital beds in the state were vacant. On Thursday, together with Chennai, its three neighbouring districts — Chengalpet (2,030), Tiruvallur (901) and Kancheepuram (502) — added 11,651 new cases, making the region the state’s hotspot.

---||Chennai||Chennai: Traffic diversions on OMR receive mixed response||CHENNAI: In an attempt to reduce vehicular congestion along Old Mahabalipuram Road (OMR), the traffic police have made a few diversions at Sholinganallur junction. Vehicles travelling from Medavakkam towards East Coast Road (ECR) can travel straight after crossing the Sholinganallur traffic signal. They can also turn right to reach Navalur. They need not turn left at Sholinganallur to make a U-turn on OMR Service Road to reach ECR or Navalur. Also, those returning to Chennai from Mamallapuram or Puducherry via ECR need not turn left at Sholinganallur junction to make a U-turn near Aavin traffic signal. They can simply wait for the Sholinganallur signal to turn green and turn right to go to Thoraipakkam. Others can travel straight to Medavakkam. Only those travelling from Navalur towards ECR will take a slight detour. So far, they could turn right at the Sholinganallur junction. Now, they must take the compulsory left there, take a U-turn (just before the Medavakkam toll plaza) to reach ECR. A traffic police release said the diversions followed a drastic change in traffic pattern along OMR soon after user fee collection was cancelled at four toll plazas on the stretch. Police conducted a volume survey during peak hours and found traffic diversions could help ease the vehicular flow. Harsha Koda from the Federation of OMR Residents Association (FOMRA) said that by asking ECR-bound vehicles (from Navalur) to take a U-turn near the Medavakkam toll plaza is going to be difficult because that part of the road has not been widened due to encroachments. "We were not consulted before making these changes," he said. Urban traffic planner Suresh Menon said that they have got back to the earlier traffic arrangement which was in place two years ago. "Instead of waiting for two signals, vehicles will now wait for four signals. So, this is not going to solve the problem," he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/traffic-diversions-on-omr-receive-mixed-response/articleshow/88886337.cms||Ram Sundaram
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Pay more if you’re taking a train from Tambaram, Katpadi||CHENNAI: Taking an express train from Tambaram and Katpadi railway stations may cost more as the railway ministry has decided to levy a station development fee of Rs 25 for sleeper class and Rs 50 for air-conditioned class travellers. The two stations are among the list of stations that will be redeveloped by Rail Land Development Authority. The move will add to the burden of the passengers who have to pay multiple fees, apart from fluctuating and varying rates of fares due to numerous classification of services like superfast, AC express or special trains at a time when all concessions have been scrapped, said a few passengers who are part of rail travellers associations in the city. An official of Southern Railway said that they are yet to decide which stations will be developed, and what charges would be levied. It will be notified separately.” There are multiple programmes for development and redevelopment of railway stations which are being done in phases, he said. R Pandiaraja, a frequent traveller and RTI activist, said that it could be considered like an indirect hike in fares when implemented. T Sadagopan, a consumer activist,said, “It is fine for railways to collect the fee but they should first consider doing so after bringing in visible changes at the stations. There have been suggestions and some work is also going on in the last couple of decades to develop MGR Central, Egmore, Ambattur, Thiruninravur, Avadi and others. But we still do not have many amenities at these stations. “The railway ministry should try to speed these before rushing in to introduce a rule that station development fee can be collected.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/pay-more-if-youre-taking-a-train-from-tambaram-katpadi/articleshow/88886338.cms||---

At 8.45 pm, Gajavaradhan, 70 of Kadamalaiputhur village in Acharapakkam was watching TV with his wife Lakshmi Bai, while his son Jaganathan, his daughter-in-law Hemalatha and son Kavin were in another room. Police said the masked gang walked into the house and began attacking Gajavardhan and Jaganathanm. They tied all the family members with a rope. They threatened the 70-year-old man and asked him for the almirah keys. Within minutes, they took away nearly 20 sovereign gold jewellery, two kg silver items and 30,000 from the house. While leaving the house, they raised the television volume to ensure neighbours don’t come to know about the robbery. Police said the gang members did not converse much among themselves to ensure that the victims do not get any clues. They left the door locked from outside. Gajavardhan managed to cut the rope using his mouth and freed other family members. He alerted his friend over phone, who later alerted the Acharapakkam police station. Police are checking CCTV footage to find out the identity of the suspects. Police suspect the involvement of a north Indian gang behind the robbery. “They have chosen the house as it is located in a deserted stretch. We are also checking if there was any stranger or friends visited them ," said an officer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/masked-gang-walks-away-with-gold-30k-cash/articleshow/88886339.cms||---
---||Chennai||Day 1 of Shaastra gives a peek into light microscope||Chennai: Day 1 of IIT Madras' Shaastra 2022, gave students across the globe a virtual peek into the mind of Romanian-German Nobel Laureate and physicist Dr Stefan Hell, whose lecture, ‘how to overcome a perceived physical boundary’, kickstarted the tech fest's spotlight lecture series on Thursday.Dr Hell, one of the directors of the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in Göttingen, Germany, won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his development of 'super-resolved fluorescence microscopy', in 2014. In a virtual conclave, he took students through his breakthrough work in the field that is known for completely changing the perception of what a light microscope can do. In normal microscopes, the wavelength of light sets a limit to the level of detail possible. In 1994, Dr Hell developed a method in which one light pulse caused fluorescent molecules to glow, while another caused all molecules except those in a very narrow area to become dark. An image was created by sweeping light along the sample, making it possible to track processes occurring inside living cells."The invention of the light microscope in the 17-18th century revolutionized our understanding of the living world, making it clear that every living being consists of cells at their basic unit structure. But the resolution of the light microscope is limited by the wavelength of light, which is about 200 nanometers. This meant that if you wanted to see objects that are closer than 200 nanometers of distance, it wasn't possible to tell them apart," said the physicist.Talking about how the electron microscope that was invented in the mid-20th century was able to achieve a much higher spatial resolution to look into sub-molecular and even atomic scale with its use of electrons instead of light, Dr Hell said he still went back to working with the light microscope for his invention, as it allowed one to look into living cells, penetrating them with minimal harm. “It was clear that if I managed to overcome this wavelength of diffraction barrier, as it's called, it would have a tremendous impact in life sciences,” he said.Shaastra 2022 has been partnered with Times of India.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/day-1-of-shaastra-gives-a-peek-into-light-microscope/articleshow/88886341.cms||---

A senior police official said those transferred out of the district faced ‘adverse remarks’. They included inspectors, sub-inspectors and constables Earlier, the government had formed a separate unit to curb extortion and brought in additional superintendent of police Vellathurai to head it. The officer had held a meeting with industrialists and their representatives to assure them that they need not be scared of extortion threats. Police then went after historysheeter 'Padappai' Guna, who was running an extortion racket. He is absconding, but an internal probe revealed a nexus between policemen and a few historysheeters. Police sources said that some of the personnel transferred were found to aiding antisocial by not registering cases whenever companies complained against them. More police personnel are likely to be transferred based on the probe.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/kancheepuram-40-cops-shunted-out/articleshow/88886340.cms||---
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Academics call for refresher courses for freshers||CHENNAI: The current batch of Class XII students have attended around nine months of physical classes in the last two years due to the pandemic. To bridge the huge learning gap due to online classes, teachers and experts have asked universities to introduce refresher courses based on higher secondary syllabus for all freshers during the 2022-23 academic year. The demand is to ensure a smooth transition from schools to colleges.  Despite a bridge course conducted by the school education department for a month, Class XII students lack clarity in basic concepts, teachers said. Since higher secondary forms the foundation of degree programmes, students will struggle to cope with degree programmes, they added. Purushothaman, a postgraduate maths teacher from a city school, said Class XII students lack conceptual clarity as the bridge course was only partially successful. “They will struggle in entrance exams and higher studies. Unless the universities or colleges come up with a bridge course, they will not be able to do well in higher studies,” he said. Some principals have said they want a majority of syllabus for the first semester in colleges based on Class XI, XII syllabus. N Vijayan, senior principal of Zion Matriculation Higher Secondary School in Tambaramm said, “To make the transition from school to college smooth, universities need to incorporate the Class XI and XII topics in the first semester syllabus. I would suggest to include 75% of syllabus from higher secondary and 25% of syllabus from first semester for degree courses considering the students have attended online classes for a majority of the last two years. Some academics wanted refresher courses to be made mandatory for first year students. “Class XII refresher modules can be made mandatory for first semester courses in degree programmes. These modules could be prepared in three clusters -- medicine and engineering courses, commerce and business, social sciences, arts and humanities," said S Vaidyasubramaniam, vice-chancellor of Sastra. For example, refresher courses can be designed for medical students based on biology, physics and chemistry and for engineering students, they should be based on maths, physics and chemistry.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/academics-call-for-refresher-courses-for-freshers/articleshow/88886342.cms||---

Although the chip crisis is more severe with cars and SUVs, the crunch is now threatening electric two and three-wheeler production as well. “Chip shortage is an issue for electric vehicles as well particularly since in EVs there is a lot more electronics. We have been grappling with this problem for the last 6 months and trying to forge long-term contracts with the chip companies. This will continue to impact the industry for the next four quarters at least and as the EV numbers increase this could turn into a bigger issue,” said Nagesh Basavanhalli, MD & Group CEO, Greaves Cotton.Part of the problem is how sharp the growth has been in electric two-wheelers in particular, and the overall EV segment in general. “The EV sector has performed tremendously over the last year and there has been a hockey stick growth. The current chip shortage has slowed the overall auto industry for the global and Indian markets. Overcoming the hurdle was challenging,” said Naveen Munjal, MD of e-two wheeler market leader Hero Electric. Auto consultants say that the crisis would have been more acute had the e-four wheeler numbers been higher in India. Right now, India’s EV market is largely driven by electric scooters, three-wheelers and e-rickshaws. “The chip shortage in India affects e-cars and some e-bikes. So, from this standpoint, the Indian EV sector’s growth momentum, which is primarily driven by e-three wheelers and e-two-wheelers is expected to continue,” said Jeetender Sharma, MD & Founder Okinawa Autotech.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/chip-shortage-hits-indias-ev-dream-run/articleshow/88886343.cms||---

Police asked members of the public to stay vigilant and avoid downloading or responding to such messages. While officers are yet to receive any specific cheating complaints, the city police has taken proactive steps to ensure public safety. A cybercrime officer said a few activists in the city forwarded some strange messages regarding registration for the booster dose to police for verification. These texts asked people to click on the attached link and enter a one-time password (OTP). Police believe suspects can then gain access to the victim’s phone and may swindle money from their accounts. On Monday, the government launched the booster or precautionary dose of anti-Covid vaccines. It said people who have completed nine months of their second dose are eligible for the third shot.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/miscreants-use-booster-drive-to-swindle-money/articleshow/88886345.cms||---
---||Chennai||Elephant poaching cases: Madras HC flays CBI for shoddy probe||CHENNAI: Expressing dismay over poor progress of elephant poaching cases transferred to the CBI, the Madras high court warned of transferring the investigation to a Special Investigation Team (SIT) constituted by the court. “We would record that the CBI could not investigate (the cases) and transfer the cases to SIT constituted by the court,” a division bench of Justice V Bharathidasan and Justice N Sathish Kumar said on Wednesday. The court then directed the superintendent of police, CBI, to appear before the court virtually on January 21 and explain the delay in investigation. The court passed the order on a batch of PILs seeking action against elephant poaching reported across the state and death of elephants in rail accidents. When the plea came up for hearing, the bench suggested that Southern Railway come up with a technology-backed solution like fixing thermal cameras in elephant crossing areas which can alert loco pilots. The court asserted that physical monitoring of such areas would not work. To this, counsel for railway P T Ramkumar submitted that the railway authorities were going to convene a meeting this week and a positive report would be filed on the next date of hearing. As to the probe into elephant poaching cases, the court censured the CBI for not showing any progress in the investigation. The agency could not even seize the ivory stolen by the poachers, the judges said. Responding to the same, assistant solicitor-general of India for Madurai bench of the court Victoria Gowri submitted that she would instruct the official concerned to file a status report on the action taken on the next date of hearing positively. Recording the submissions, the court adjourned the hearing to January 21. On February 10, 2021 a coordinate bench of the court in Madurai ordered CBI probe into the elephant poaching cases reported in the state. The court passed the order in view of a report submitted by the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB) that persons belonging to other states were involved in elephant poaching activities and that no actions were taken against the middlemen and the kingpins. WCCB was also directed to assist the CBI in the probe.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/elephant-poaching-cases-hc-flays-cbi-for-shoddy-probe/articleshow/88886346.cms||---

---||Chennai||Chennai: New Covid high no cause for panic||CHENNAI: The city on Thursday reported an all-time high of 8,218 new Covid-19 cases, nearly a quarter of the total samples tested. But doctors, paramedics and public health administrators aren’t worried because unlike the peak in May 2021, there were no long queues outside hospitals or shortage of oxygen and lifesaving drugs. Chennai, which topped the state in terms of new cases, also reported the sharpest increase in fresh cases. The city reported 7,372 cases on Wednesday. During the peak of the second wave in 2021, it reported a maximum of 7,466 new cases on May 11 and 7,564 cases on May 12. This spike pushed up active cases too. On Thursday, there were 46,515 patients under treatment for the viral infection and among them 2,991 patients or around 6% were in hospitals, including 256 in the intensive care unit. “Patients in nearly 85% of cases in clusters have the S-gene dropout, a proxy indicator for Omicron. Most have a mild infection. The disease affects the bronchi but doesn’t invade the lungs,” said health minister Ma Subramanian. The situation was quite different last year. On May 12, 2021, there were fewer active cases (40,613), but 12,624 people were in hospitals, including 1,935 in intensive care units. Most patients in the ICU weren’t vaccinated, requiring expensive drugs and high-flow oxygen or ventilators. This time, with more people vaccinated, deaths are low. On May 11 and 12 last year, the city reported 92 and 89 deaths. On Thursday, Greater Chennai Corporation recorded eight Covid-19 deaths. But experts warned that the number may be low in terms of percentage, but with quick increase in cases, admission in terms of absolute numbers will go up. “That is enough to overwhelm the healthcare system, tire out doctors and nurses, and result in complications,” said WHO chief scientist Dr Soumya Swaminathan, who is on TN’s panel of experts For instance, the percentage of active patients in hospitals has come down from 25% to 6% in a week. But in absolute numbers, there are 3,000 patients in the hospitals compared to 2,000 earlier. ICU occupancy has increased from 6% to 13%. “If cases continue to increase, the occupancy rate will increase too and it will be a strain on the health systems,” said health secretary J Radhakrishnan. Many labs in the city have extended the turnaround time for results to up to 48 hours. The city conducts nearly 35,000 tests a day and the daily positivity rate is hovering between 20% to 25%. “This is why we are trying to keep infections low. Though we have curbs and restrictions, we are not under a complete lockdown. People must wear masks and maintain social distance,” Radhakrishnan said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/new-covid-high-no-cause-for-panic/articleshow/88886348.cms||---

Police are hoping to find clues in CCTV camera footage, but are yet to zero in on a suspect. Earlier, a special investigation team (SIT) was formed to investigate the alleged assault during which sharp objects were inserted into her private parts. Alwar SP Tejaswani Gautam said investigations were underway. Meanwhile, the minor is recuperating at the city’s JK Lone Hospital where she had to undergo a surgery on We-dnesday. Food and civil supplies minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas said, “This is a very serious offence, which will not be tolerated. The accused will be meted out the sternest punishment.” Rajasthan police said that the girl’s parents were working at a farm on Tuesday when she left the house around noon to meet her relatives who live in the same village. Around 3.30pm, a woman spotted the girl hailing a tempo. She was discovered on the flyover bleeding around 7.40pm. The State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) has taken suo motu cognisance of the rape and sought arrest of the perpetrators of the crime at the earliest. It has directed the district police superintendent to submit a detailed inquiry report by the next hearing on January 18.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rajasthan-rape-minor-undergoes-op-cops-yet-to-find-any-suspect/articleshow/88885012.cms||---

Of the 53.4 lakh people who were administered the first dose, 46.4 lakh (87%) took it in a UPHC, revealed data shared by the civic body with TOI. Meanwhile, 88% or 35.5 lakh people took their second dose at a UPHC of the total 40.5 lakh beneficiaries. While private centres charge up to ₹1,500 a shot compared to free vaccination at public health centres, officials said the cost factor was not the sole reason behind the UPHCs turnout. “UPHCs are the face of the corporation. We began door-to-door vaccination services for the physically challenged. We held mega vaccines camps on Sundays using the full strength of our health staff. Lately, we have also linked 1913 helpline for booster dose vaccination,” said corporation commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi. The civic body also held vaccination camps on streets, in apartments and workplaces and extended outreach measures to vaccinate vendors in markets such as Koyambedu. Officials said these outreach measures right from the initial stages to dispell hesitancy, fears and boost coverage, played a role in UPHCs gaining people’s trust. Fourteen UPHCs were in the top 15 vaccination centres in the city that boasted of the highest number of vaccinations, data from CoWIN showed. At no.15 was Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital. Padi, Mirsahibpet, Porur and Vadapalani UPHCs have vaccinated a total of more than 2 lakh. Health officer Dr M Jagadeesan said the turnout at UPHCs is an encouraging sign that compliments the healthcare provided by the civic body. “Many categories (of people), who don’t usually come to UPHCs, came for the vaccination,” he said, adding that the civic body ensured accessibility in vaccination for all.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/90-of-chennaiites-got-covid-jab-at-uphcs/articleshow/88886349.cms||Omjasvin M D

Earlier, violators had to pay Rs 200. The order was issued by health secretary J Radhakrishnan and published in the state gazette on Wednesday. The amendment will allow officials to penalize people failing to wear a mask covering the nose and mouth. “When people step out, they must wear a proper mask... We have increased out vaccination coverage to a large extent and most of our people are double vaccinated. While vaccination reduces risk of disease and death, there is still risk of infection,” said director of public health Dr T S Selva Vinayagam. An ICMR survey in November showed that mask usage was 32 % in slums and 35 % in non-slum areas in outdoor spaces like streets, markets and bus stops.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/now-pay-500-fine-for-not-wearing-mask/articleshow/88886350.cms||---

A TNPCB study said air quality remained within accepted standards in almost all areas, but many in Madhavaram, the most polluted part of the city, complained of breathing difficulties. “Pollutants such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide at all 15 monitoring stations have been found to be within standards. Particulate Matter (PM 2.5) was in the range of 18-54 against the standard 60,”TNPCB said. Night curfew and awareness must have led to fewer bonfires, the board said. The smog lifted around 8.30 am in most places whereas it had lingered till 10.30 am last year. There were marginal flight delays at the airport as airlines delayed departure from origin airports to avoid reaching the city between 6 am and 7.30 am.

---||Hyderabad||Lakhs left Hyderabad to celebrate Sankranti amid Covid virus scare||HYDERABAD: Lakhs of people have left the city for their hometowns to celebrate the Sankranti festival with their loved ones, amid the rising cases of Covid-19. While many are taking TSRTC buses and trains, quite a few are driving to their hometowns or hiring private vehicles to stay away from the crowd. “About 20-25 lakh people have used TSRTC buses in the last four days to reach their destinations in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh,” said VC Sajjanar, managing director of TSRTC. He said that the corporation has been running 4,000 special buses—3,000 in Telangana and 1000 to AP to clear the Sankranti rush. Likewise, the South Central Railway (SCR) is running 225 special trains, of which 50% of them are to various destinations in Telangana and AP, in January. “We are running many special trains for Sankranti to Sabarimala and other destinations. These trains will stop at all major stations,” said Ch Ramesh, chief public relation officer, SCR. Although the private buses are charging comparatively higher prices during the Sankranti season, many, especially those travelling at the last minute, are using their services. Shops selling colourful kites and clothes, among others, are full of people as denizens are busy making arrangements to celebrate the festival with their friends and family. “My kids started flying kites from the beginning of this week. I bought kites and manja in bulk so that they don’t have to run to shops amid the pandemic every time their kite gets damaged. They are spending most of the day on our balcony flying kites,” said Vekateshwarulu Y, a private employee. Many households are also busy preparing sweets and savouries for the festival. “It is a tradition for us to prepare ‘ariselu’ and ‘murukulu’ for Sankranti. This year too we are preparing them in large quantities so that kids can have them as snacks for a few days instead of outside food,” said Shanti B, a housewife.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/lakhs-left-city-to-celebratesankranti-amid-virus-scare/articleshow/88886355.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Fake gold theft complaints keep Hyderabad cops busy chasing shadows||HYDERABAD: False complaints of gold theft have become a headache for cops already having a hard time catching the culprit and then wasting more time on trying to recover what was never stolen. The net effect, cops said, is that their recovery rate gets hit due to non-existent stolen goods. Police officials said that an investigator can count himself lucky if the complainant accepts not giving an accurate statement. In such cases, police can make them give a statement that items were found at home, furnish the same in court and close the case. If that doesn’t happen, then cops have one extra non-existent unsolved case at hand. Even when there is clear evidence of false complaint, cops said they have the hard task of proving it and at the same time are perceived as siding with the thief if they arrest the complainant. A senior cop from Rachakonda said that people still believe that if they overstate the amount of gold stolen, they would get close to what they lost when police recover it. This doesn’t happen any more because of targeted recovery from the accused and, hence, there is no distribution of recovered gold among a group of complainants, he said. “Also, some lie in the hope that a little gold may come their way when police recover it from receivers of stolen gold,” he said. Recounting a theft in Vanasthalipuram in October last year, an investigator said: “A woman said that two gold bangles weighing three tola, a gold chain weighing half a tola, a pearl chain with one tola gold and Rs 3,000 cash was stolen from her home when the family was away. Thanks to CCTV and other leads, the accused was arrested recently and he confessed to stealing the cash but not gold.” The cop said that when the family was confronted by the investigators they became evasive. In another case in Balapur in July 2021, a businessman claimed loss of a gold necklace, a cell phone and silver anklets. The arrested accused confessed to stealing the silver anklets, but denied taking gold. Similarly in March 2021, a teacher from Balapur claimed losing a gold necklace, a pair of earrings, a mobile, a power bank, a perfume bottle, Rs 50,000 cash. The accused coughed up most of the items, but said there was no gold and the stolen cash was nowhere near Rs 50,000. In all the three cases cops said that it became clear that the complainants had lied. Cops are now hoping to get a statement that the ‘stolen’ gold was found at home, file the same before the court and close the case. While in another case in October 2021, a woman’s secret sent cops on a gold recovery hunt. The 30-year-old woman, a grocer from Meerpet, had claimed that a thief snatched her 2.5 tola gold mangalsutra while she was at the shop. But when the thief was arrested, the story changed. It was imitation gold and the thief even showed the spot he had thrown it. “We seized the item and when the woman was quizzed, she begged us not to inform her husband as she had told him it was real gold,” an investigator said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/fake-gold-theft-plaints-keep-cops-busy-chasing-shadows/articleshow/88886360.cms||Mahesh Buddi

However, in terms of overall forest cover, Hyderabad is fourth after Bengaluru, Mumbai and Delhi. The city saw its greenery increase by 48.66 sqkm, i.e., from 33.15 sq km in 2011 to 81.81 sq km in 2021. Three other megacities, Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai, saw their forest cover increase by 11%, 9% and 26% respectively. Bengaluru, Ahmedabad and Kolkata lost substantial greenery. ISFR monitors the cities’ forest cover based on its digitisation of forest boundaries. Within the area of digitised boundary back in 2011, the overall green cover in Hyderabad accounted for 5.23% only, which was fourth lowest after Chennai. In 2021, Hyderabad’s percentage of total forest cover with respect to the area of digitised boundary stands at 12.9%, making it second-highest after Mumbai. The break-up of Hyderabad’s forest cover shows that moderately dense forest (MDF) spans across 17.68 sq km and open forest (OF) is at 64.13 sq km. Additional principal chief conservator of forests Mohan Chandra Pargaien credited Telangana’s afforestation initiative Haritha Haram for the results. Taking to Twitter, Mohan said, “Harithaharam Tree Planting programme Telangana yielding results. Hyderabad tops among megacities gaining max forest cover in a decade.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/hyd-sees-max-rise-in-forest-cover/articleshow/88886363.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

---||Hyderabad||Theatres cannot be seen as pvt buildings, SC had said||Hyderabad: On Thursday when actor Chiranjeevi met AP chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy to brief him on the difficulties being faced by Telugu film industry amid growing worries over ticket pricing issue, the words of Supreme Court judge Justice K Ramaswamy way back in December 1991 ring true.In Deepak theatre versus Punjab state, the Supreme Court in its December 6, 1991 verdict held that the power to grant a licence to a theatre has in it the power to regulate ticket prices. It said a theatre cannot be seen as a private building of an individual owner. There was an element of public interest attached to it and hence one has to run it in tune with some rules and regulations fixed by the state, was the essence of the ruling.Justice K Ramaswamy said in his judgment then: “Witnessing a motion picture has become an amusement to every person; a reliever to the weary and fatigued; a reveller to the pleasure seeker; an importer of education and enlightenment enlivening to news and current events; disseminator of scientific knowledge; the perpetrator of cultural and spiritual heritage, to the teeming illiterate majority of the population.”“Cinemas have become tools to promote welfare of people to secure and protect as effectively... The passage of time manifests this growing imperative and the consequential need to provide easy access to all sections of society to seek admission into theatre as per his paying capacity,” he said. Even in the case of DKV Prasad Rao versus government of AP where the AP high court rendered judgment on April 8, 1983, the verdict was pronounced by Justice Ramaswamy.Heading a three-judge bench of the SC, Ramaswamy in his 1991 order said imposing conditions on a licence was a regulatory measure to fix rates of admission and classification of seating in the interest of public. But those who are defending the film industry have other woes to share. The onset of OTT platforms and coronavirus have added to the woes of film lovers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/theatres-cannot-be-seen-as-pvt-buildings-sc-had-said/articleshow/88886368.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana seeks sensors to capture true picture of water releases||HYDERABAD: Stressing that Andhra Pradesh should not be permitted to draw more than 34 tmcft, including Chennai drinking water requirements, from river Krishna at Srisailam reservoir, Telangana has urged the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) to establish sensors all along Pothireddypadu head regulator, all outlets from Banakcherla cross regulator and outlets from Kandaleru and Poondi borders to get a correct picture of water releases. The Telangana government also asked the Board to include issues relating to modernisation of Rajolibanda diversion scheme anicut to ensure that the state realises its full share. Telangana engineer-in-chief (irrigation) C Muralidhar wrote a letter to KRMB chairman on Wednesday expressing the state government’s views on enhancing Krishna water supply to augment the drinking water supply to Chennai. The issue was discussed at the KRMB meeting last month. During that meeting, the AP government suggested a lift irrigation scheme be taken up to meet the drinking water requirements of Chennai. However, the Telangana government argued AP should meet Chennai’s drinking water scheme within the allocations and rejected the lift irrigation scheme proposal. The KRMB sought the views from various states —Telangana, AP, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu — on the drinking water schemes as there was a proposal of laying a pipeline to Chennai for drinking water from Krishna. “The AP government can draw only 34 tmcft, including 19 tmcft water requirement to Chennai, from Srisailam reservoir. As per the interstate agreements, Planning Commission’s approval, and Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal-1, the canal intended for Madras (Chennai) shall not have any irrigation component. Contrary to this, AP enhanced the capacity of the regulators and channels,” the ENC said. In violation of the letter of agreement, the AP government had located the off-take point at Chennamukkapally, 175 km away from Srisailam reservoir.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/t-seeks-sensors-to-capturetrue-picture-of-water-releases/articleshow/88886369.cms||Koride Mahesh

As it became dark, the scene was secured. Clues collection from the crime scene and inquest will take place on Friday morning,” said a Nalgonda cop. A team of Rachakonda and Nalgonda cops is now collecting CCTV footage near the building.On Monday morning, the severed head of the 30-year-old victim, R Jaihind alias Jayender, was found at the feet of Mahankali idol at Gollapalli village in Nalgonda.

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Deccan Cements mining operations flouted green norms, says NGT||HYDERABAD: Deccan Cements Limited has allegedly violated environmental clearance conditions and mined limestone illegally in Suryapet district. In a recent order, the National Green Tribunal southern bench has asked the mining department to assess the value of the illegal mining quantity and recover the amount from DCL. The key allegation is the violation of specific conditions laid down by the Union ministry of environment in EC, where DCL mined limestone in Mine-3 and Mine-2 simultaneously even before mineable ore of Mine-2 is exhausted . DCL mined limestone of 1000 metric tons in 2014-15, 2.3 lakh MT in 2015-16 and 1.8 lakh MT in 2016-17 in Mine 3, which is termed illegal by NGT. The NGT has issued the orders based on the petition filed by Vakkanti Koteshwar Rao, a farmer from Palakeedu mandal in the Suryapet district, alleging pollution by the cement factory and violation of environmental laws. In 2013 DCL was given the license to mine in Saidulunama reserve forest to 183 hectares in Ravi Pahad. In reply to NGT, Deccan Cements said that it has obtained all required government permission and measures to control the emissions. The company also alleged that the petitioner is a transport contractor. As his request for a transport contract was not entertained, he filed the application with a personal vendetta and ulterior motives. In December 2019, NGT formed a joint committee of representatives of various departments to verify the allegations and the committee submitted a report in March 2020. The report mentioned that Telangana State Remote Sensing Application Centre has conducted a survey and found that the two locations have 2.24 crore metric tons of limestone in the Sadiulunama reserve forest that was leased to DCL. DCL has mined excess than the permitted quantity of limestone for which it has paid royalty. While issuing environmental clearance to DCL for Mine-3, the ministry has permitted the company to produce limestone at a capacity of 0.3 million tonnes per annum. It has also put out a condition that mining activity in Mine-3 at Ravi Pahad shall begin only after the Mine-2 in Mahankali Gudem has exhausted its mineral ore. However, the DCL operated Mine-3 before Mine-2 got exhausted. The committee also levied environmental compensation of 28 lakh.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/deccan-cements-mining-ops-flouted-green-norms/articleshow/88886374.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

---||Hyderabad||Forest cover: Make use of carbon funds, says Niti Aayog to Telangana||HYDERABAD: Looking at Telangana’s green cover enhancement initiatives, Niti Aayog officials have asked the state to use carbon financing to further increase its tree cover. The suggestion comes at a time when the state has been ranked second in the country after Andhra Pradesh in forest cover increase. Sources said Telangana’s Haritha Haram programme to improve the green cover has been praised immensely during a recent meeting in Delhi. “The state should look into more ways to use carbon finance as many countries, such as Switzerland, are willing to fund these activities as grants in states that have shown significant improvement in green cover,” a government source privy to the development said. Carbon funds help nations finance forest conservation and reduce climate change impacts from forest degradation. Many of the world's big corporations support carbon financing to address the larger goals of global warming. Haritha Haram is billed as the largest plantation drive in the country and third in the world after China and Brazil. State government officials were in Delhi a few days ago to discuss and seek funding for backward districts in the state. "During the discussion, officials said that many states do not comply with various parameters in order to receive funding, even by the great effort they don't become eligible but Telangana does, which is huge for us," a top official said. Vice-chairman of the State Planning Board B Vinod Kumar said Niti Aayog officials have recognized the efforts and have asked the government to intensify the programme. "Telangana has consistently worked to improve the green cover, forest cover, and greenery since its formation in 2014," he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/niti-aayog-to-t-make-use-of-carbon-funds/articleshow/88886380.cms||Sribaala Vadlapatla

Founded in July, 2020, the group was initially launched on WhatsApp to connect with people who needed Covid-19 related assistance. “After tragedy struck my family and I lost my uncle, I launched the group in order to help others. Along with some of my acquaintances, we started sharing resources on that group,” said Siddharth Rao, founder of the group who works as a content writer for a tech firm. During the second wave, the group was flooded with requests from people seeking hospital beds, oxygen cylinders, medicines, and food. “On May 6 last year when the country recorded the highest number of Covid-19 cases, we catered to nearly 3,800 requests in a single day. We got distress calls from people not being able to get discharge, funds, ambulance to carry the body of the deceased. We attended to as many as we could,” said Rao. Many helped by the group have also joined the efforts. Among them was Bharati Krishna. “In June last year, when my mother was in the hospital, I was frantically looking for Remdesivir. When I joined the Combat Covid group, my request was escalated and I could get the medicine on the same day at an affordable cost. Not just that, the volunteering group also helped me with food, hospital bed and in arranging ambulance,” said Bharati. From bankers to software professionals, the group has volunteers from various backgrounds. “The group works very organically and is not very structured. People who received help from Combat Covid also started volunteering with us. It is a collective effort by a lot of other volunteers from different groups who have come together for the same cause,” said Rao. With the Covid-19 numbers surging yet again, the group is all set to attend to distress calls.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/combat-covid-group-ready-for-another-fight/articleshow/88886381.cms||Preeti Biswas

At least 50% health workers in Cantonment areas are yet to take the booster shot, officials said, adding that while some are yet to make up their mind, there are many who are falling prey to rumours and declining the third shot.“We can’t force them to take booster doses. In fact, we are trying to convince them by counselling them about the need for it,” DyDMHO Dr H Rajkumari told TOI.As of date over 90% of these frontline workers have been vaccinated with two doses, she said, adding, “Unless health workers realise the importance of the third shot, the department can’t force them.” On the other hand, the response has been very good among policemen and their families, officials said.A health worker, referring to their tough working conditions, said: “Even if we take the booster dose, what is the guarantee for our lives.”Meanwhile, officials in Cantonment and GHMC areas have been asking citizens to wear masks and follow Covid rules while in public places.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/health-workers-in-cantt-go-slow-on-booster-jab/articleshow/88886390.cms||Sunil Mungara

Instead, he deputed health minister T Harish Rao and chief secretary Somesh Kumar to attend the meeting. This is not the first time that KCR has not attended the meetings held by the PM. In February last year, the CM had skipped the crucial Niti Aayog meeting chaired by Modi, citing health reasons. Again in March 2021, the CM gave Modi’s video-conference with CMs’ on Covid-19 cases a miss. He had deputed the chief secretary and health secretary to attend the meeting saying he was busy with his reply on motion of thanks to the governor’s speech in the assembly. While official sources said he could not attend the meet due to health reasons, political analysts see it as a widening gap between the ruling party in the state and BJP government at the Centre. The CM made no bones about his unhappiness against the Centre’s policies, especially on paddy procurement issue, by not attending the meeting, sources said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/kcr-skips-modi-meet-with-cms-on-covid-19/articleshow/88886392.cms||Koride Mahesh

A bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice N Tukaramji said this in an order pronounced after hearing a PIL challenging parts of the state excise laws.The bench refused to interfere with the rules and said that the petitioner did not bring to the notice of the court any such violation. “The state should take steps to ensure that the consumption of liquor does not take place outside the permit rooms or outside the bar which causes inconvenience to the public at large,” the bench said. The excise department in its counter said it granted 2,144 retail licenses. “As people were thronging these shops, huge queues were a regular scene at these shops. Hence we permitted these retail license holders to set up permit rooms adjacent to their liquor shops to allow the buyers to consume the same at the attached permit rooms,” excise officials said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/hc-remove-permit-rooms-near-schools-hosps-homes/articleshow/88886394.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Rs 50 crore global credit card scam busted; 7 held from Hyderabad, Delhi||HYDERABAD: An inter-state gang involved in international credit card fraud by cheating payment gateways, including one belonging to a prominent private bank, to the tune of nearly 50 crore was busted on Thursday and seven persons were arrested from Delhi and Hyderabad. They reportedly targeted residents of the United Kingdom, Singapore and Australia. Addressing a press conference on Thursday, Cyberabad police commissioner Stephen Raveendra said that New Delhi-based Naveen Bhutani, Mohit, Monu and city-based B Nagaraju, D Sravan Kumar, V Pavan and SM Srinivas Rao — were arrested from their respective locations. However, police said that the investigation was still in initial stages and they did not have full information about how the accused used the money and the money trail. In the execution of the credit card fraud, these seven accused in coordination with a few others missing accused set up an organised system by developing fake websites, took international toll-free number connections besides setting up fake call centres in Janakpur in New Delhi, Kaushambi in Ghaziabad and Mohali in Punjab. For the websites, which the accused created offering different fake e-commerce services, they took the services of payment gateways. The accused contacted people in the United Kingdom, Singapore and Australia by sending online ads or bulk fake SMSes about payment alert or make direct phone calls to some claiming to be technical service providers of prominent e-commerce and cloned their credit cards. For customers who had raised red flag after realising the fraud transaction, their respective banks froze the money. However, in a payment transaction, the payment gateway would generally pay money to the final service provider/ vendor in advance with an understanding that the bank would return the money. But, since these were fraud transactions, the banks did not release the money to payment gateways. On the instructions of Sravan, Nagaraju had developed websites and integrated them with payment gateways. Nagaraju links the bank accounts of Srinivas Rao, Pavan and others to these payment gateways. It was Nagaraju, by operating these bank accounts, would forward the ill-gotten money to Mohit after deducting the agreed commission, police said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/50cr-global-credit-card-scam-busted-7-held-from-hyd-delhi/articleshow/88886400.cms||---

---||Kolkata||No reagent for genome check in 1 of 2 labs in West Bengal, supply next week||KOLKATA: One of Bengal’s two institutes that can track mutants or variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has run out of reagents and is expected to resume its genome sequencing activities next week when supplies resume. Sequencing work has been stalled at the laboratory of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology (CSIR-IICB) Kolkata for about three weeks now. The last samples it tested was on December 24. The lab at Salt Lake, however, hopes to get its reagent supply by Monday. “We want to resume our genomic sequencing activities as early as possible. Hopefully, the reagents should reach us in the next few days enabling us to resume our work by early next week. Genome sequencing has become all the more important so that we can keep an eye on emerging variants or mutants of the virus,” said CSIR-IICB director Arun Bandyopadhyay. The IICB, which had been conducting genome sequencing since the beginning of the pandemic for academic purposes, was recently brought under INSACOG (Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics consortium) to scale up sequencing for surveillance as the number of samples that needed to be analyzed swelled. Its lab can run 100 smaples in 48 hours. The National Institute of Biomedical Genomics (NIBGM) at Kalyani, a nodal unit for genome sequencing in eastern India, was part of the consortium right from the beginning. The NIBMG Kalyani came under huge pressure last month when the Bengal government decided to sequence all Covid positive samples that had CT value within 30 to determine if Omicron had spread in the community. The health department then started sending samples to IICB through the School of Tropical Medicine. Currently about 100 of these samples are waiting to be sequenced.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/no-reagent-for-genome-check-in-1-of-2-labs-in-state-supply-next-wk/articleshow/88886403.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

The deaths were confirmed by Jalpaiguri district magistrate Moumita Godara Basu. Around 250 passengers have been rescued from the wreckage. With several passengers still trapped inside two badly mangled bogies, officials fear the toll could rise further. There were 1,053 passengers on board, said a North East Frontier Railway official. Doctors at Jalpaiguri district hospital, where the more seriously injured were admitted, said the condition of at least 10 passengers was critical. It initially appeared that a crack in the tracks caused the accident. Track repairs were reportedly under way on the stretch. A high-level railway safety inquiry has been ordered. Railway board chairman V K Tripathi and the director general (safety) have rushed to the spot. Railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw is expected to reach on Friday. Vaishnaw also announced Rs 5 lakh compensation to each family who lost a loved one, Rs 1 lakh each for the seriously injured and Rs 25,000 for minor injuries. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was discussing the Covid situation with state chief ministers, spoke to Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee separately, inquiring about the accident after the news broke during the meeting. He also spoke to the rail minister. “Spoke to Railways Minister Shri @AshwiniVaishnaw and took stock of the situation in the wake of the train accident in West Bengal. My thoughts are with the bereaved families. May the injured recover quickly,” he later tweeted. Banerjee briefly exited the PM’s meeting to give instructions to the district administration on relief and rescue work. She, too, issued a tweet: “Deeply concerned to hear about the tragic accident of the Bikaner-Guwahati Express in Maynaguri. Senior officers of the state government, DM/SP/IG North Bengal are supervising rescue and relief operations. Those injured will receive medical attention, as early as possible.” Thursday’s accident was the Indian Railways’ first instance of passenger deaths in nearly 34 months since March 22, 2019. Local residents, passengers who escaped unhurt, railway officials from Jalpaiguri and New Domohani stations and local firefighters were the first respondents.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/7-killed-50-injured-as-train-jumps-tracks-near-jalpaiguri/articleshow/88886404.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Cal HC reserves order on PIL to defer civic polls||Kolkata: Calcutta High Court has reserved judgment on the public interest litigation (PIL) seeking postponement of the four civic polls scheduled for January 22 after the respondents – the state and the State Election Commission (SEC) – couldn’t come clear on who had the authority to defer municipal polls to Bidhannagar, Asansol, Siliguri and Chandernagore in the wake of Covid surge in Bengal.State counsel Samrat Sen on Thursday pleaded there was no scope for interference by the state government regarding change of election date once it had been announced in consultation with SEC. Sen contended that SEC could defer the polls, if necessary. He also submitted that the court could defer polls under Article 226 of the Constitution.The division bench of Chief Justice Prakash Shrivastava and Justice Ajoy Kumar Mukherjee then wanted SEC to come clear on poll postponement. “We want clear submission whether the SEC has the power and authority to defer the polls,” the CJ observed. Senior SEC counsel Jayanta Mitra argued that under law, the commission couldn’t defer polls on its own; SEC had to consult the state government. Mitra further submitted that SEC could defer polls only if the state government declared a “disaster or an emergency” that would make it impossible to hold elections.The division bench then sought Mitra’s opinion on the powers vested in SEC under Article 243ZA of the Constitution. The clause provides that SEC shall have powers of “superintendence, direction and control” of the municipal poll process. “Do you want to submit that the hands of the SEC are tied when it comes to deferring polls?” Justice Shrivastava said. The SEC counsel replied in the affirmative. The CJ then asked Mitra if SEC had the requisite number of Covid-free personnel to man polling booths. The counsel submitted that SEC had as many as 12,400 polling personnel and another 2,800 in reserve. “All possible steps have been taken to ensure that security of people is not jeopardized,” Mitra said. Responding to apprehensions expressed by the petitioner’s senior counsel, Bikash Bhattacharya, who cited Bengal’s high positivity rate of 40%, state counsel Sen submitted that vaccination rates in the four civic areas were quite high. Sen told the court that in Bidhannagar, Covid positivity rate was 19.5% with 100% second vaccination; in Siliguri, it was 16.9% while 92% had got the second dose; in Asansol, 72% of voters had got second dose, and in Chandernagore 95% got double vaccination.After hearing all parties, the bench held it would upload the order on the high court website after considering the views.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/cal-hc-reserves-order-on-pil-to-defer-civic-polls/articleshow/88886406.cms||---

Braithwaite, a central public sector undertaking (CPSU) which was under ministry of heavy industries, later shifted to railways, was under the purview of BIFR from 1992 to 2006. The chairman and managing director of Braithwaite, Yatish Kumar, told TOI that it is expecting a turnover of Rs 700 crore in 2021-22. Last year, it had registered a revenue of Rs 609 crore. “From a loss of Rs 44 crore in 2016-17, we shall achieve a profit of Rs 42 crore this fiscal,” he added. Last year, it booked a profit of Rs 31 crore.According to the CMD, the company made a real turnaround in the last few years. The business hovered in the range of Rs 120 crore-Rs 150 crore from 2014-15 to 2017-18. “Subsequently, the company shifted its revenue generation strategy from core manufacturing sector to service sector & new verticals like wagon repairs at railway sites, retrofitting of twin pipes, sub-assembly of wagon components, O&M of workshop, crane services & AMC, bridge construction & civil projects, ship repairs. Since then, Braithwaite grew in performance achieving the highest ever sales profit in 2020-21, the same being enumerated graphically,” he added. The net worth of the company has gone up from Rs 3 crore to Rs 120 crore now. Braithwaite now has four divisions — manufacturing, construction, services and maintenance. “The PSU has 60% manufacturing and 40% services.

The mistakes he made, meeting the press, taking pictures...people are talking about his trip to Spain. Even the Australian government could have handled it differently. I don’t think anybody comes out of it looking great.” Though preparations have not been ideal for Djokovic going into the tournament this year, Somdev still feels it’s hard to count the Serb out when it comes to Melbourne Park. “You have to keep Djokovic ahead. Interestingly, both Novak and Rafael Nadal are in the top half. You cannot ignore Nadal when he is around. These two will definitely start as the favourites. But I feel (Daniil) Medvedev also has a good chance to go deep,” the 36-year-old said.In the women’s draw, Somdev picked Ashleigh Barty and Naomi Osaka as the favourites. “Barty is in great form. She has already won an event this year. Osaka is a great talent and she is a former champion here. The women’s draw is always open but for now it’s Barty or Osaka for me,” he said.Somdev is disappointed that there will be no Indians in the singles main draw. “It’s disappointing that none of them (Ankita Raina, Prajnesh Gunneswaran, Ramkumar Ramanathan and Yuki Bhamri) got past the qualies,” he said. “We still have Rohan (Bopanna) and Saina (Mirza) left (in the doubles) but we have been banking on them for a long time now. Both performed well last week so who knows they can come up with a good show.”Watch Australian Open from Monday on SONY SIX , SONY TEN 2, SONY TEN 4 (English) & SONY TEN 3 (Hindi).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/djoko-fiasco-couldve-been-handled-better-somdev/articleshow/88886410.cms||---

The inclement weather and triple-screening at three points before stepping on the Sagar Island have slowed down the crowd flow. There were around 5 lakh people there last January and it usually draws about 13 lakh-15 lakh for the dip. “The crowds are thinner. The weather has improved this morning so more people may reach by night,” said Sunderbans affairs minister and local MLA Bankim Hazra, who was among the ministers supervising at the spot. Both Kapilmuni temple and the beach will have restricted access with drop gates and barricades. Only a limited number of pilgrims will be allowed to take holy dip at a time. In a first, the district administration has arranged for sprinkling of holy water using drones on pilgrims standing in earmarked zones along the bank. Rows of vessels with holy water have been kept for devotees in a zone around Kapilmuni Ashram and drop gates have been installed to prevent more than 50 pilgrims on the temple premises at a time. State minister Shashi Panja said, “Having cleared the three buffer zones, we presume those arriving here are mostly fine. There are additional measures being taken here.” Police were seen asking everyone to use masks and those who weren’t wearing them were given masks. The pilgrims were also being sanitized. Kolkata mayor Firhad Hakim was supervising the arrangements. On Thursday, cops in Kolkata allowed pilgrims with vaccination certificates and asymptomatic thermal checks to go on. According to sources, while the rapid antigen tests helped KMC and cops segregate around 120 infected people, there was still a section awaiting RT-PCR results. “We had tried to segregate those awaiting results. but with Makar Sankranti on Friday, none was ready to stay back. It has been decided to let them proceed towards Kachuberia where the South 24 Parganas administration has arranged for contact tracing and segregation. We have phone numbers of those who have undergone RT-PCR tests in Kolkata. The reports will be sent to the DM’s office there. We also have phone numbers of group leaders whom we have held accountable for bringing in a patient if s/he is infected and needs isolation. So far, such cases have been few,” said a source. Lalbazar officers monitoring the camps between Babughat and Bangabasi Grounds are asking transport department staffers to let the pilgrims board only after they show vaccination certificates.

The honour was conferred on the nonagenarian writer and illustrator by MLA Arup Ray and Bengal’s additional chief principal secretary B P Gopalika. The 96-year-old was hospitalized on December 24 and is currently on ventibipap support. Debnath had to be hospitalized owing to acute weakness, followed by low haemoglobin. For over 70 years now, Debnath has been creating landmark Bengali comic strips, including ‘Bantul the Great’, ‘Nante Fante’ and ‘Handa Bhonda’. He holds the record for the longest-running comic by an individual artist for the ‘Handa Bhonda’ series and is the first and only Indian comics artist to have received a DLitt degree. Last January, Debnath was hospitalized a little after the announcement of the Padma Shri awards. Seated in his hospital bed on January 30, 2021, he had drawn a sketch of his famous cartoon character Bantul. It hadn’t taken long for the video of him drawing Bantul to go viral. According to granddaughter Alicia Debnath, that, perhaps, was the last time he had drawn a cartoon. Debnath had been discharged and taken back home. But his health started deteriorating last July. “He had renal issues and suffered from sodium-potassium imbalance and had to be given strong medicines. Dadu, who would earlier watch television or chat with us, was largely confined to bed,” she said. On Thursday, she was present at the hospital when the honour was conferred on him. “In between, Bengal’s governor had come home and greeted him. My grandfather is usually very reticent. When I had asked him how he felt when his name was announced as a Padma Shri recipient, he had said ‘bhalo legechhe’. Dadu was honoured. He had really waited for the award to reach him. Dadu would even ask me: ‘Koi tor Padma Shri? Kobe ashbe?’ (Where is your Padma Shri? When will it come?),” she said. The Padma Shri finally arrived when his condition was “quite serious”. “Thursday happens to be the 21st day of his hospitalization and the third day he is on ventibipap. This is certainly not a suitable time to confer an award on him,” she said. On being asked if the pandemic had impacted the nonagenarian’s life, she said, “No. We didn’t allow people to meet him when he was at home. He would sometimes ask us if people were still wearing masks.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/bantul-creator-receives-padma-shri-in-hosp-bed/articleshow/88886413.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

Krishnendu Banerjee (45), who doesn’t have any Covid symptoms, has isolated himself on a first-floor room with his ailing father and has opted for work from home while his wife, mother, son and a domestic help are living in their Howrah house even after contracting infection. The sheer volume of Covid positive cases and the even greater number of people showing Covid-like symptoms have turned the concept of isolation on its head. Families now have Covid-negative people and those with no symptoms isolating themselves instead of the other way round. “While on my way back home, I learnt my wife and brother had Covid symptoms. I asked to get themselves tested. My wife’s aunt stays with us also had mild symptoms. By the time I reached, my wife and brother had fever but were under medication. There was no point in myself getting infected as well and thus I isolated myself in a room to ensure others could have better accessibility in the house. Now while my family is getting better, I managed to keep ordering essentials and help my family while remaining in isolation myself. It has been a week, and my family will come out of isolation by Friday,” said Basu, a wedding and fashion photographer. Similar has been the case for Howrah resident Banerjee, who too took care of the entire family down with Covid and Covid-like symptoms while staying in isolation himself. “As everyone started falling ill, I knew I had to remain fit to ensure there is someone to look after my father and also make sure he doesn’t contract the infection. I isolated both of us in a room on a separate floor and has so far managed to remain clean,” said Banerjee, who works at a private firm. The state currently has 1.16 lakhs active cases with more than 22,000 new cases on Thursday. However, doctors feel an even larger number of residents are sick with Covid-like symptoms but they haven’t got themselves tested yet. “I had fever, cough and cold, body ache and all other Covid symptoms last week and was left bedridden for at least two days. My son also had similar symptoms but we didn’t get us tested and had initially gone into isolation. But when my sister-in-law also started showing symptoms, we came out of isolation and my husband, who was the only one fit even now, moved into a room beside the kitchen and isolated himself. He has been cooking and taking care of us,” said Tanima Mondal, a Behala resident. Doctors said they are also receiving a number of similar cases and are also advising the families to isolate negative members at present. “I have been treating a number of cases where out of six members in a family, four are positive while two are negative. In such situations, the standard instruction is to isolate the negative members of the family instead of positive patients to minimize the spread of infection,” said virologist Rahul Jain.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/third-wave-turns-isolation-on-its-head-covid-ves-seclude-themselves-at-home-as-cluster-infections-rise/articleshow/88886414.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: In hospital with other ailments, seniors find they are Covid positive||KOLKATA: The majority of patients admitted across Covid ICUs of Kolkata’s private hospitals are those who sought admission for comorbidities but tested positive on arrival. They include cardiac, renal, diabetes and neurological patients who had no Covid symptoms till they were tested at the hospital. Experts say this is a reversal of the trend that prevailed during the first two waves when Covid had aggravated comorbidities, forcing hospitalization. A substantial number of elderly and comorbid patients are getting admitted with non-Covid ailments and testing positive without Covid symptoms, pointed out RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) intensivist Sauren Panja. “Most of the 43 patients at our ITU are those with non-Covid infections or diseases like cardiac, kidney and respiratory that have nothing to do with Covid. They have tested positive on arrival and had to be moved to the Covid ITU. Their comorbidities, however, have not yet worsened their condition,” said Panja. At CMRI Hospital, too, majority of Covid ICU patients tested positive at the time of admission. “They were admitted with ailments that may or may not have been triggered by Covid. But their Covid symptoms are negligible, unlike the previous occasions when most ICU patients had severe symptoms that aggravated the comorbidities,” said CMRI director of pulmonology Raja Dhar. At Belle Vue Clinic, too, most of the 20 ICU patients had been admitted for non-Covid treatment but tested positive. “They are the majority but their Covid symptoms remain mild and their non-Covid ailments are more serious,” said CEO P Tondon. Delay in hospitalization, too, is often triggering a sudden deterioration in condition of Covid patients, especially the elderly and comorbid, leading to ICU admission and a poor recovery rate, says a section of experts and doctors. Initial mild symptoms are turning out to be misleading for these patients who have been suffering a sharp decline in their vital parameters, including a drop in oxygen saturation level on the fourth or fifth day from testing positive. They now form the majority of ICU patients admitted across private hospitals and the casualty rate, too, has been highest among this group, say hospitals. It could be risky to assume that all Covid cases are now mild, said Peerless Hospital microbiologist Bhaskar Narayan Chowdhury. “First, we still might be having a few Delta cases that would be more virulent than Omicron. The elderly with comorbidities will be vulnerable if they get infected with Delta and the initial symptoms could still be mild. Even in case of Omicron, those with cardiac disease, diabetes, kidney or lung ailments are prone to a sudden deterioration after a few days which has often been happening, They are being brought to hospital in a very serious state,” said Chowdhury. RTIICS has 48 beds in critical care with an occupancy of 43. “This number has been a constant for last 3-4 days. We will constantly monitor the situation and if it rises in the next two days, then we would plan to increase the critical care beds next week,” said RTIICS zonal head R Venkatesh.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/in-hosp-with-other-ailments-seniors-find-they-are-ve/articleshow/88886415.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

While the college authorities lodged an FIR at Beniapukur police station, local residents, college alumni and members of various women’s organizations reacted sharply to what seemed like a deliberate act to remove the alphabets BOURNE from the name and leave LADY BRA in place to denigrate not just those associated with the institution but every women in Kolkata.As photographs of the college gate with the altered name went viral on social media, college principal Siuli Sarkar lodged an FIR at Beniapukur police station. “Our college reopened on January 3. But none had noticed the theft or defacement as that gate is rarely used. What’s been done is indecent and derogatory. We have asked the cops to take stern action against whoever has done this and asked the PWD engineers to remove the other alphabet blocks immediately,” Sarkar said.Police are scanning CCTV footage from nearby shops as well as traffic cameras to check if they can identify the miscreants.Discovery of the defacement on Thursday left college teachers and alumni simmering. “I just can’t believe this. I felt very upset after hearing this because it looks very odd,” said Sumana Chatterjee, a 1991 batch alumnus. Writer Sharmistha Duttagupta, who is from the previous batch, said it was a sexist act to spoil the image of the college. Author Mandakranta Sen, who is also an alumnus, added: “Those who have vandalized the educational institution should be punished.”Mental health activist Ratnaboli Ray said the act reminded her of the assault on Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar bust a few years ago. Anuradha Kapoor, founder director of Swayam that is committed to advancing women’s rights and ending inequality and violence against women and girls, said there was no doubt it was a deliberate act and not a simple theft.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/lady-brabourne-defacement-shocks-kolkata/articleshow/88886416.cms||---

To begin with, 90 students of second-year MSc and post-basic BSc nursing students will be involved in the care of Covid patients from Monday. Health officials said more students would be called in for Covid duty if the need arises. TOI had on January 12 reported about the government’s plan to engage nursing students for Covid-19 duty and had asked principals of nursing colleges to provide basic Covid care training to them. Earlier, the Union health ministry had issued a directive that hospitals can augment their manpower by taking in medical and nursing students if needed. Many students will be posted at the CNCI while some will be deployed in Covid facilities in South and North 24 Paraganas. Heath officials said that while the first and second-year Bsc nursing students will be utilised for screening of Covid patients, third and fourth-year students could be used for mild and moderate cases. MSc nursing and post-basic BSc nursing students could be used in the care for critical patients.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/90-nursing-students-in-first-batch-for-covid-care/articleshow/88886419.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kolkata||Cops check on Pronam members||Kolkata: The commissioner of police, Vineet Goyal, has asked all police stations to check on the health of senior citizens, especially the Pronam members, who reside alone in the different police station areas. The divisional brass has directed each police station to create a WhatsApp group for the elderly and make video or audio calls to them at least once a week. The move came after several Pronam members, infected by Covid, found it difficult to make arrangements for grocery and medicines. Many of the Pronam members with severe comorbidities have been provided the contact numbers of cops so that they can contact them in emergency. The top brass, who held virtual meetings with officers from divisions and the Pronam members over the past few days, asked their colleagues to give priority to the welfare of senior citizens. Goyal himself interacted with a few Pronam members to know whether the programme was coping with their needs and challenges of the pandemic.“If the senior citizens remain connected with us, we can always know their situation and they will also feel relieved that they are not entirely living in isolation. There are 18,000 registered members with Pronam,” said an officer. The anti-bank fraud and the cyber cell of the detective department also gave presentations on how senior citizens should take precautions to stave off frauds, which have been common during the pandemic. The doctors, who attended these meetings, also informed the Pronam members about various methods to stay safe and healthy amidst the pandemic.Senior officers at Lalbazar said they have been extending the Pronam operations to cover the Covid scare for the past two years. “But this will not be restricted to the Pronam members. A senior citizen in the city, who is in need of help, can contact us,” said an officer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/cops-check-on-pronam-members/articleshow/88886420.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The symbolic bonfire was lit and the rituals were observed at the Calcutta Punjab Club. But members did not break into a bhangra to the beat of drums like they traditionally do during Lohri. “We have to abide by government rules that limits participation to 50 persons at any gathering. What is important is that everyone stays safe. The festival can be celebrated with more vigour next year,” said club president Hari Om Batra.Former club president Sanjay Lamba recounted this was the first time the celebrations had been so muted. “Even last year more people participated because the restrictions were not in place.” Social activist and businessman Satnam Singh Ahluwalia cut down on the celebrations but didn’t let the social curbs restrict his charity work. While he usually throws a mega-party on Lohri, this year he and his volunteers made use of the time to distribute rations and essential supplies to the needy in a programme christened ‘Langar on Wheels’. Businessman Manav Soni said: “In spite of Covid, we have to continue celebrations with all safety measures to boost morale in these tough times.” C S Bedi, former president of the Planters Society of Eastern India, said the family too wasn’t in a mood to celebrate in a big way due to the spiralling cases everywhere.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/muted-celebrations-on-lohri-this-year/articleshow/88886422.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Garia-Golpark autos stay off road for over 12 hours||Kolkata: Autos resumed plying on two routes — route 28 (Garia-Golpark) and route 105 (Golpark to Dhalai Bridge) around 12 noon on Thursday after going off the roads for more than 12 hours, not before putting the morning peak hour passengers in real trouble at a time when a large number of buses have been requisitioned for the Ganga Sagar mela. The services resumed only after police arrested five of the attackers on auto operators.Passengers, who entirely depend on autos of these routes, found themselves stranded. “There were fewer buses and we are afraid of catching infection while travelling on a bus. But there were no autos at Garia crossing. We had to hire a taxi to travel the stretch,” said Anamika Tarafdar, a lab assistant at Pathological Lab at Golpark.Like Anamika, 70-year-old Monoranjan Bhakta had trouble finding his way back from Golpark to Garia after visiting an ailing relative. He also had to board a crowded bus. Commuters heaved a sigh of relief after autos resumed services at around 12 noon. Both the routes suspended operation from Wednesday afternoon after two autos were damaged and two auto drivers sustained injury following an attack on them by a mob. The incident happened after auto union leaders asked hawkers to steer clear of the Shahid Bedi near the 5 No. bus stand at Garia. “Since 2011, we have been hoisting flags on the Martyr’s Day, on Independence Day. It is a sacred place for us which we don’t want to be occupied by hawkers. For the last few days, we saw some people started occupying the place for hawking. On Tuesday, we found a ‘gumti’ came up there, completely blocking the view of Shahid bedi. We then asked them to vacate the place,” said Debraj Ghosh, a member of auto union at Garia.But in the afternoon, some 250 people attacked auto-operators, damaging two autos and injuring two auto operators. This led to the suspension of autos of two routes. Though none of the autos of 105 routes were damaged, they suspended the operation in solidarity to the protest by Route 28 operators. Police swung into action and arrested five persons for the alleged attack. This pacified auto operators who finally resumed services from noon on Thursday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/garia-golpark-autos-stay-off-road-for-over-12-hours/articleshow/88886423.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Girder-launching starts for new Tallah bridge||KOLKATA: The much-awaited girder-launching or construction of superstructure of the new Tallah road overbridge (ROB) has started. State PWD, the implementing agency, is chasing a mid-2022 deadline to complete the Rs 350 crore Tallah bridge reconstruction project. PWD engineers and contractors L&T are working on a war-footing to complete erection and launching of girders to build the bridge deck. PWD’s principal secretary, Onkar Singh Meena, told TOI, “The girder-launching is on in full swing, even at night, despite the ongoing Covid situation which has several labourers infected. The railways have allowed power and traffic blocks so that the spans can be launched over the tracks.” The 60-year-old bridge was pulled down in April, 2020, because it had worn beyond repair. Construction of the bowstring four-lane bridge began in August. On December 9, the last milestone was achieved as the commissioner of railway safety (CRS) gave its nod for girder launching. CRS, the autonomous body under the ministry of civil aviation, clears any new railway project across the country. The new Tallah bridge is actually a road overbridge (ROB) under Eastern Railway’s ambit. A 240m section of the 750m structure will stand over the Tallah railway tracks operated by ER. Six piers each on the Shyambazar and the Dunlop end and another six in the middle will support the deck slab over the railway tracks. The superstructure will be a continuous girder system spanning the railway tracks, built with the launched-girder erection technique or sequential erection of the girders one after the other, using high-capacity cranes. “Construction of two spans (between piers 7 and 8 and between piers 8 and 9), on the railway tracks, by the girder-launching, is the most crucial part of the project,” said an engineer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/girder-launching-starts-for-new-tallah-bridge/articleshow/88886424.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

Though the complex has security guards, residents said they were not a deterrent and could easily be overpowered by men wielding guns. “In the 14 years that we have lived in the apartment, we have never encountered something as sinister as this. Residents are feeling extremely vulnerable since the incident occurred. Even a day later, it gives me the shudder to think someone walked in with a gun and shot a person here,” said Keshab Residency Apartment Owners’ Association president Dilip Biswas. Being one of the first premium residential units in the belt, the 84 apartments in the complex are home to professionals like engineers, doctors and lawyers as well as businessmen. Senior radiation oncologist Subir Ganguly, who has lived in the locality for five decades, said he had never imagined something like this would happen one day. “Adjoining to the spot where the murder happened is the lawn and parking area where children residing in the complex play. Opposite the complex is a populated slum where people who toil for a living live. Had there been a confrontation, anything could have happened. It is time the police acted firmly and political parties denied space to criminals who seek their support for vested interest,” he said. Suresh Kumar, who lives in one of the two towers and has been a local resident for 40 years, was also shaken by the incident. “That something like this could happen in a busy and crowded place like this is unbelievable. A sense of insecurity has gripped the area,” said the businessman. Rita Shau, another resident of the area, said the incident had jolted everyone. “We only heard of such incidents on news channels or watched them on movies. Now, it has happened at our doorstep. We are living in fear and anxiety,” she said. “For decades, people from different communities, religion live in this area peacefully. There has been no major trouble. This incident, therefore, has shaken the trust of the residents of the area,” said 70-year-old Tapan De. The association president felt the shopowners who were sold space by the promoter have always been a problem, stocking hazardous material, refusing to pay maintenance and refusing to come clean on the nature of business.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/never-thought-we-would-see-a-man-being-shot-dead-in-our-complex/articleshow/88886425.cms||---

Police said a piece of land at Barasat, which both Dipak Das, the victim, and Rakesh Das, the accused, wanted to promote might have only added to the acrimony between the two distant relatives, both hailing from Bihar. The cops are yet to trace Rakesh with special teams from north division and detective department looking for him at possible hideouts in North 24 Parganas and Bihar. Dipak’s family — settled near Amherst Street — told cops that Rakesh helped Dipak spread his chicken supply business. “Rakesh played a major role in handling Dipak’s finances before they ended their partnership a few months ago. The fact that Dipak was concentrating on promoting led to clashes between the two,” said Krishna Sahu, a cousin of the victim. Police said Dipak had been staying at Amherst Street for years before settling in Barasat-Sodepur after marriage and concentrating on property business. He used to travel to Kolkata each day and all his aides were aware of his schedule, including the time they could find him alone at his office in Keshab Residency.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/dispute-over-barasat-land-behind-murder/articleshow/88886426.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Calcutta University has decided to conduct all the examinations through digital mode due to the third wave. Government too has suspended all in-person classes due to the spread of the virus. Several colleges have also published the rules and regulations for students taking the online examinations and the digital platform they will be using to give the examinations. Many colleges have kept a provision for students to submit the hard copies of their answer scripts if they are unable to upload the scripts on the college’s examination portal. Students of Asutosh College taking the examinations will have to do a one-time registration before the examination starts. Students can use their university registration ID or student ID to log onto the exam portal. “Students can upload the scanned copy of their answerscripts with their names, roll numbers and semester written on them. Files should be within 25 MB of size,” said an official of Asutosh College. Question papers will be available on the websites of Calcutta University and the website of the college as well. “Students can download examination papers from www.cuug.in, www.cuug20.in,www.culibrary.ac.in,” said an official of the university. Goenka College of Commerce and Business Administration has issued guidelines for the examinations which has been conveyed to the students through the internal WhatsApp groups. “Students can only use A4 paper. After they have written their exams they must scan the sheets as a file and name it with their subject code and roll number. Official mail IDs have been provided to students where they can mail the scripts. Students who are unable to mail the scripts can deliver it to the college’s office at the end of each day’s examination in a sealed envelope,” said an official. Colleges have created special portals and mail IDs for students to download question papers and submit their answer scripts. “It seems we might have to continue with hybrid mode for some more time. It is important that we ramp up our digital infrastructure,” said the principal of a south Kolkata college.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/colleges-ramp-up-e-infra-for-ug-semester-exams/articleshow/88886427.cms||Zeeshan Javed

There are about 30.6 lakh registered unemployed waiting for their turn to get a respectable job, as of now. The government has also announced recruitment of 4,000 constables, which has already been delayed by almost a year. There are 12.5 lakh applicants against 4,000 posts. Last time the constable exams were held in 2017, one year before the assembly elections in MP. In December 2021, thousands of educated unemployed had assembled in Jabalpur and Ujjain where recruitment for a handful of class four jobs was underway. These incidents reflect on the joblessness and unrest amoung youths in the state. There are 3059933 registered unemployed whom the government adresses as active job seekers on the employment portal of the state government. It also shows that the number of jobs available is 15,535 with 16,145 active employers. Interestingly, the nature of jobs available mentioned on the portal are 4,752 posts for machine operators, 532 sales officers, 164 accountants , 134 tele-callers. 50 courier boys , 5 receptionists among others. Moreover, none of these jobs belong to the government departments. Hence, there are hardly any takers for jobs like machine operators, many of which were advertised almost seven months back. Many of the employers offer salaries much less than the minimum wages approved by the government, said sources. The government has tied up with some private companies, mentioned as active employers on the portal and these vacancies are available with these firms, a government official said. The government has not mentioned the number of vacancies available with government departments. The unemployed youths are surprised over CM Chouhan’s statement on the birth anniversary of Vivekanand on January 12 that the government will provide one lakh jobs every month, but he did not elaborate on how the jobs would be created and what would be their nature .||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/uphill-task-for-govt-1l-jobs-every-month/articleshow/88886457.cms||Deshdeep Saxena

Even now, false claims are being made about job fairs, and employment are figures. Claims have been made over the past several months about giving employment to one lakh persons per month. False promises of recruitment to fill the backlog and vacant posts are also being made for several years.”He said that the number of unemployed youths registered in the state has reached close to 34 lakh. “Recently we saw 11082 highly-educated persons applying for 15 posts of peon, driver, gardener and sweeper in Gwalior court. For 25 positions of driver and peon in Ujjain court, 9500 persons applied and in Indore, there was slogan shouting for jobs during the chief minister’s interaction with the students.

Almost 100 cases of Covid positive teachers and students in the schools have been reported in the state capital. The school education department, however, has admitted only a dozen positive cases reported in teachers and students. Teachers said that they are vulnerable to Covid as they have been attending schools regularly even when campuses are closed. “Most of the teachers in schools have been giving online lectures from campuses only. While it could be online classes for students, it has been completely offline for the teachers. This has made the teachers most vulnerable,” said a teacher without quoting his name. Teachers added that they are left with no option but to accept the instructions to deliver online lectures from schools only. “After the first wave, several teachers had to lose their jobs as campuses were closed. In the present situation, we need jobs and can’t take a risk of not attending classes as per the schools’ instructions. If the campuses are closed again there are more chances of losing the job again. We have to feed our families and can’t take any chances in the present scenario,” said another teacher. The condition of the government teachers is also challenging. “Besides academics, we have been given several other duties also. In these duties, we have to come in contact with several people that we can’t avoid. This is where teachers become vulnerable to Covid,” said a government teacher without quoting his name. When contacted, a senior official of the school education department said that teachers have been doing the challenging task.  “We have been trying to get in touch with the teachers who are being infected. However, the problem is that the teachers in private schools do not share their data about the exact situation. As far as government teachers are concerned we have given instructions to take all possible precautions while being on duty,” said the official without quoting his name.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/100-teachers-students-covid-ve/articleshow/88886467.cms||---

The issue popped up while the deputy mayor presented the agenda to renew the insurance of vehicles owned by the city corporation. UDF parliamentary party leader Padmakumar questioned the agenda and said that one of the vehicles on the list being presented on the agenda was not in use anymore and that P K Raju was presenting a faulty list. P K Raju then challenged Padmakumar to do a site inspection and confirm whether the vehicle was not in use or not. Earlier in 2021, BJP councillors had consistently raised mismatches in the number of vehicles owned by the corporation. They had relied on RTI data to pinpoint contradictions. Both LDF parliamentary party leader D R Anil and P K Raju had failed to furnish proper explanations. They had paid for their ill-preparedness as BJP councillor Karamana Ajith pounced on both their mistakes during a special council meeting held in 2021 on revenue and assets. Ajith openly pointed out serious contradictions in the number of vehicles read out by D R Anil and that was mentioned in the audit report and the administration report. When asked to summarize and furnish a reply, P K Raju stammered his way through the financial statements of previous years, often misreading crores as lakhs, evoking further criticism from the opposition.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/deputy-mayor-in-trouble-over-corps-vehicle-data/articleshow/88886483.cms||---

Shaiju Khan earlier worked in Saudi Arabia. Three years ago he returned home. Though he ventured into many businesses none of it succeeded. Lately, the couple had been running a textile shop and a juice stall at Vilachikkala. The inspector said that there were marks around Jasmine’s neck suggesting the possibility of strangulation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/woman-found-dead-in-suspected-murder-suicide/articleshow/88886485.cms||---

While UDF and BJP councillors welcomed the agenda to rent a home for the mayor, they questioned the delay in completing the project ‘Mayor’s Bhavan’ at Kunnukuzhy. BJP councillors said that the project was almost two decades old and it was unfortunate that the LDF which ruled the council all these years could not get the project done till date. They alleged that it was the delay in the completion of the project which led to mayor having to rent out a residence. LDF parliamentary party leader D R Anil responded that Mayor’s bhavan was never meant as a project to construct a residence for mayor but as a building that integrated various other components. D R Anil also said it was local protests at Kunnukuzhy which had impeded the progress of the project. His remark provoked Kunnukuzhy councillor Mary Pushpam and she said that the LDF was forcing the project on the residents there. “The project site is in SC colony, Barton Hill. About 250 families will be affected. Besides there is a community hall, an anganwadi, a tailoring institute which are linked with the livelihood of the people. Why is it being forced upon them?” she asked. Senior councillors Palayam Rajan and Gopakumar rebuked Mary Pushpam and said that her declared stand to oppose a project at any cost would not be encouraged. “LDF council has been more than humane in its approach so far. You cannot challenge anyone with such open declarations of protest,” said Palayam Rajan. P K Gopakumar went one step further and said that Mary Pushpam was acting under the influence of some people with vested interests and that she was denying the chance of development there. The state government has given sanction to civic bodies to utilize their own fund to take buildings on rent to be used as official residence of the mayor. The government had issued an order based on a letter from Thiruvananthapuram city corporation secretary. As per the order, the maximum permissible rent for the building shall be Rs 15,000 and onetime expense of Rs 1 lakh will be sanctioned for deposit, furnishing and maintenance expense. The furniture and other items being bought for the rented residence shall be treated as the corporation’s assets. Mayor will have to bear the cost of water and electricity.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/mayors-bhavan-kicks-up-a-debate-in-council/articleshow/88886486.cms||---

As on Thursday, the district Covid surveillance team confirmed the presence of 18 active clusters in Thiruvananthapuram. The clusters were centred on colleges, hostels and private as well as government hospitals and district medical authorities remained tight-lipped about the spread. District medical officer Dr Jose G D’cruz reportedly directed the surveillance team not to divulge information on Covid clusters in a vain attempt to put up a different picture. “I have to check. I am busy,” he said in response to TOI’s request for comment. It is learnt that the surveillance team has been monitoring the clusters for the past few days. A PRD release was also silent on the 18 active clusters in city. College of Engineering, Trivandrum recorded more than 100 active cases among its students. A special college council meeting was held following which it was decided that all classes would be conducted online starting from Thursday. Besides, all series tests were postponed. A mass Covid test is scheduled at CET on Friday. All students, except final year B-Tech students and students from other states, were directed to vacate the college hostel by Saturday. More than 15 active cases were confirmed at Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology, forcing authorities to reschedule medical procedures. Also, 35 students of a private engineering college tested positive after returning from trips at Kullu/Manali and Vagamon. Of the 18 clusters, 16 are within corporation limits and two clusters were detected at Nedumangad municipality and Karavaram panchayat. Cluster of cases has also been confirmed at the military station in Pangode; two delta positives were identified here. Nursing staff and doctors in hospitals are reporting reinfections now. RCC is also dealing with positive cases among its staff. “We do have positive cases among our staff probably because the vaccine effect has waned. They are the ones who got it first almost a year ago. So booster dose for staff has started on a war footing. We are facing a bit of staff shortage, but somehow we are managing extra duties and shift adjustments. Long-term follow up cases have been asked to put off their reviews at RCC. Patients on active treatment can’t be deferred though. Bystander restriction has also been tightened,” said RCC authorities. The capital recorded 3,404 positive cases with a TPR of 32.2% on Thursday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/third-wave-sweeps-capital-with-18-clusters-tpr-at-32/articleshow/88886492.cms||---

If the CPM has plans to manhandle Congress leaders and workers on street, Congress should not be expected to suffer it all with folded hands. CPM should be ready to restrain its cadres. If Pinarayi Vijayan’s police are not able to give protection to the Congress party offices and Congress leaders, thousands of Congress workers are ready to take over that responsibility. CPM should not think that it can scare the Congress with high-handedness,” Sudhakaran said. Sudhakaran said CPM workers were on a rampage in all 14 districts, attacking Congress leaders, workers, and offices. The Congress party has suffered loss of lakhs of rupees in the attack by CPM workers.  “Police are giving protection to the antisocial elements that indulge in violence. DYFI workers tried to manhandle MLA Mathew Kuzhalnadan and several other leaders. He was attacked when participating in a television discussion at Moovattupuzha TB. Kollam MP N K Premachandran and Congress leader Aritha Babu, who contested the assembly election from Kayamkulam, were attacked by DYFI and CPM men respectively,” the KPCC chief said. If Congress ventured out to settle score for murders, CPM would have vanished in Kerala, he said. He also accused CPM leaders of trying to hold the KPCC responsible for the murder in Idukki. “The CPM leadership is trying to capitalize on the murder in Idukki. The CPM district leadership intervened to suppress the truth behind the murder on the campus. The CPM is threatening police officers for their statements that the murder was not a planned one,” Sudhakaran added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/sudhakaran-lashes-out-against-cm-and-police/articleshow/88886493.cms||---

In Kalaburagi, a divisional headquarters for KK, coverage is 34% and Yadgir is struggling at 29%. The health officials are attributing below par coverage to absenteeism and hesitancy among parents. Although daily, health staff visit the schools, they are unable to speed up the inoculation. Of the total targeted population of 1,59,770 in Kalaburagi, 54,035 teens have got the jabs and in Yadgir 21,360 have been inoculated from the total 73,965 targeted population. Both districts are in the bottom two. According to Prabhuling Mankar, the district immunisation officer, government schools have registered less than 50% attendance every day since the vaccination began. For the unvaccinated children, health department staff must visit their homes to administer the vaccine with the consent from parents. Also, the majority of the kids in the two districts study in government facilities. Prabhuling said that because of the fear of the rapidly spreading Omicron variant, a section of parents have stopped sending their children to school. Also, many children have dropped out of school during the pandemic and have not returned to class. District health officer Sharanabasappa Ganajalkhed told TOI that apart from absenteeism, in some pockets vaccine hesitancy is an issue. In rural pockets, parents are reluctant to consent on vaccines. Health officials are working hard to convince them. This may yield results, he said. Yadgir district health officer Indumathi K Patil said absenteeism is high in schools. “Now, we are changing the strategy by visiting the homes of the children. There are many dropouts and we are making all effort to reach them,” she said. If the schools are shut in the coming days, then vaccination drives will take a severe hit, a health official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/absenteeism-and-hesitancy-cripple-kids-vaccine-drive/articleshow/88884411.cms||Shreyas HS

Police have recovered Rs 16.8 lakh of the robbed amount, senior officers said. The arrested men have been identified as Deepak Chand (36), Satya Narayan (43), Sanjay (35), Kishan (36) and Rahul (22). A mobile phone, a three-wheeler and a scooter have been seized, police said. According to the cops, Chand arrived at the Bara Hindu Rao police station around 9pm on January 10 with his employer, Pratap Singh, and reported that when Chand and his friend Rahul were carrying Rs 17.7 lakh in cash from Chandni Chowk to Singh’s office in Karol Bagh, two men on a scooty intercepted their three-wheeler near the Kishan Ganj railway line and fled with the bag containing the cash. They said the duo had even taken away the mobile phones of both Chand and Rahul. After the alleged robbery, the three-wheeler driver also fled, police were told. Deputy commissioner of police (north) Sagar Singh Kalsi said that following the complaint, a case of robbery was registered. “Our teams inspected the scene of crime and both employees and the auto driver were questioned in detail. The team even minutely analysed the footage from CCTV cameras installed nearby. On re-interrogation, all the three people narrated a different version about the occurrence of the incident,” said the DCP. The complainant, his friend Rahul and auto driver Kishan were then interrogated separately at length and Deepak finally disclosed that he and Rahul had staged the robbery to earn easy money along with their other friends, Satya Narayan, Sanjay and Kishan, Kalsi added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/five-men-held-for-staging-heist-to-pocket-businessmans-rs-17-lakh/articleshow/88885282.cms||TNN

---||Business||LIC chief bats for deploying bionic agents||Mumbai: The chairman of IPO-bound Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) of India, M R Kumar, has said that digital platforms embedding insurance in a bid to monetise their user base poses a challenge for insurers. Kumar has proposed a strategy of deploying ‘bionic’ agents by extending tech support in the form of digital tools and analytics to the agency force. Kumar called on insurers to build core digital sales capabilities and explore a win-win model for partnering these platforms where there is a convergence of digital and physical world. He was speaking at the inauguration of the 23rd annual C D Deshmukh Seminar held under the aegis of the National Insurance Academy and LIC. “Large digital platforms are keen to monetise their customer base and see the opportunity to embed insurance into platforms. This poses a challenge for insurers as they run the risk of losing customer ownership for our set of customers, especially the millennials to these platforms,” said Kumar. He added that the millennial segment was the opportunity of the decade for life insurance companies and, along with urbanisation, was the biggest growth driver. The LIC chairman said that the millennial segment was seeking a superior experience and this called for insurers to reimagine their journey & process, and partnering insuretech companies to achieve this was an opportunity. “Traditional channels need to evolve to serve younger and more digitally savvy customers. In addition, insurers need to build newer distribution models. Also, insurers need to explore partnerships with large digital platforms, creating win-win models,” said Kumar. This would be possible by insurance companies deploying a sales force of bionic agents by equipping agents with next-generation digital tools and analytics. “So, they need to combine the best human qualities of advice and engagement with the rigour and intelligence enabled through technology,” said Kumar. He said that customers would in future engage with the company through digital channels but expect personal interaction for more complex products. “Insurers must embrace the integration of physical and digital channels once the crisis subsides. Life insurance companies can direct leads to the channel or agent that best serves each customer’s needs,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/lic-chief-bats-for-deploying-bionic-agents/articleshow/88885300.cms||---

Torus Kling Blockchain IFSC, a joint venture between Mumbai-based Cosmea Financial Holdings and Hyderabad-based Kling Trading India, has signed an MoU (memorandum of understanding) with BSE’s international arm India INX to launch digital asset-based products, which will be traded in GIFT City’s IFSC (international financial services centre). The development comes after the US securities regulator SEC in October 2021 allowed launch of a crypto futures ETF, the first such in the US. ETFs like these track returns from cryptocurrencies without investing directly in the digital tokens. The Torus Kling crypto futures ETF will be launched in a sandbox environment, which is under GIFT regulatory authority IFSCA. Such a sandbox allows regulated entities to launch and live-test products under strict controls so that any emerging risks or faults could be quickly corrected before it affects many investors. Once the Torus Kling ETF obtains regulatory nod, Indians will be able to invest in this ETF using the RBI’s liberalised remittance scheme (LRS) route. Global investors, who have similar options in the US and Switzerland, will have another alternative to invest through the regular process. According to India INX’s MD & CEO V Balasubramaniam, the exchange is looking at launching digital asset-based products and has already made an application to IFSCA under the regulatory sandbox. “This is part of our product innovation initiative to benchmark offerings with other international finance centres,” it said. India INX plans to launch more such products. According to estimates, global annual derivatives trading volume in the cryptocurrency market is about $3.2 trillion, while total spot volume is at approximately $2.7 trillion. According to Torus Kling Blockchain IFSC’s CEO Krishna Mohan Meenavalli, this type of new asset class is just the tip of the iceberg. “ETFs allow trading through regular investment accounts, bypassing the hassle and security concerns of cryptocurrency exchanges,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/asias-1st-crypto-etf-may-roll-out-in-gift-city/articleshow/88885265.cms||Partha Sinha

This would put the Adani Group in direct competition with Tata Steel, JSW Steel and ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel. The conglomerate, which is India’s largest player in ports and renewable energy, has been making moves for a play in the metals sector. Last month, it incorporated a new arm for aluminium and, before that, it announced a foray into copper. The pact with Adani, one of India’s most powerful business houses, will fulfil Posco’s long-held ambition of having a large steel mill in the country. Posco had looked to set up a $12-billion steel unit in Odisha. But the project ran into rough weather due to delays in getting mining rights for iron ore (a key raw material in steel making) and opposition from locals in acquiring land. This time around, Adani would bring land in Mundra, Gujarat to the table for the plant for hot-rolled steel (used in construction). Mundra houses Adani’s port, power and processed food facilities. Posco, on the other hand, will bring its steel-making prowess to the alliance. The South Korean company, the world’s sixth-largest steel maker, already runs a 1.8-million-ton mill in Maharashtra for cold-rolled steel (used in home appliances and automobiles). Besides, it has four processing centres in the country. Adani is likely to hold a majority stake in the steel venture with Posco, which will mark its entry into the sector. Apart from steel, Adani will collaborate with Posco to explore opportunities covering renewable energy, hydrogen and logistics industries in response to carbon-reduction requirements, the Indian conglomerate said, without spelling out details. Adani is making a $20-billion push into green energy to make its businesses a net-zero carbon emitter by 2030. The Adani-Posco steel venture could leverage on the Indian conglomerate’s logistics and renewable energy infrastructure in Mundra, industry sources said. For instance, the steel plant could source power from Adani and the latter would get a captive customer in the alloy maker.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/adani-enters-steel-biz-with-5bn-posco-pact/articleshow/88885309.cms||Reeba Zachariah

CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan had said that the dance programme as part of the party conference should have been dropped. “We should have postponed the programme. We could not scrap the event as hundreds of participants had reached the venue for the performance,” the district secretary told the media on Thursday. Education minister V Sivankutty also came out against the programme for which senior CPM leaders, including politburo member M A Baby, were spectators. While Baby is yet to react on the incident that put the CPM in defence, Sivankutty said the dance programme did reflect the lack of diligence on the part of the organizers when Covid cases are rising in the state.  It was Janathipathya Mahila Congress of Parassala area committee that organized the ‘Thiruvathira’ featuring 550 women.  The dance programme, conceived as a paean to the CPM and LDF government, showered accolades to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan by projecting him as the leader who saved Keralites from the perils imposed by natural calamities. Following the controversy, Parassala police have registered a case against the organizers for Covid protocol violation. Meanwhile, the district conference would begin with floral tributes at the Martyr’s Square at 10am on Friday.  Chief minister and CPM politburo member Pinarayi Vijayan would inaugurate the conference at 10.30am.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/dance-event-should-have-been-dropped/articleshow/88886494.cms||---

The revenue recovery that was just 34% in 2020-21, has further slowed down to 12% till October last year. As per the latest data accessed by TOI, as much as Rs 5,959.68 crore is due to be added to the public exchequer through revenue recovery alone in the state. Of this, Rs 3,760.55 crore is stuck in various stay orders by the court as well as by the government. Of the remaining Rs 1,830.22 crore that is immediately available for recovery, only Rs 231.76 crore has been recovered till November 1 last year. The revenue dues to the government include dues under sales tax, agriculture income tax, excise tax, motor vehicle tax and forest dues. Except Kottayam, Kollam, Alappuzha and Idukki, the remaining 10 districts are yet to recover more than 80% of the dues through revenue recovery. The districts in the descending order of the dues pending for recovery include Wayanad (93.98% of the amount pending for recovery), Malappuram (93%), Kasaragod (92.95%), Palakkad (92.20%), Kannur (91.22%), Thiruvananthapuram (90.95%), Kozhikode (90.80%), Pathanamthitta (88.72%), Thrissur (85.97%) and Ernakulam (84.32%). Even the four districts that have ‘performed well’, have recovered only less than 30% of the lease dues till November 1. In 2020-21, till March 31, the recovery rate was just 33%, which was mostly owing to stopping all the recovery steps due to the pandemic. Though the situation is better in the ongoing year, revenue department sources said that the department machinery and the district administration are focused more on fire-fighting in the last two years due to the pandemic as well as natural calamities, rather than giving focus to such measures like recovering the revenue dues. Though the government does not permit granting stay orders on the revenue dues, permission is granted in deserving cases, staying one-time settlement of dues by converting them to equal instalments. The LDF government had in 2017, delegated powers to tahsildars to sanction repayments of revenue dues up to Rs 25,000 through a maximum of 10 instalments. The government had also increased the limits of the district collectors on which they can take a call, to Rs 2 lakh in the case of bank loans and up to Rs 1 lakh in the case of dues to the government. Also according to the delegated powers, while the finance minister can take decisions on dues up to Rs 10 lakh, the revenue minister can take a call up to Rs 5 lakh. Any defaulters above Rs 10 lakh will have to go to the chief minister for availing clearance for payment in instalments. But despite all such orders, the successive governments have been sanctioning indefinite stay on large defaulters, mostly under political or other kind of influences, that has been another key reason why the revenue dues are mounting.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/states-revenue-dues-mounting-as-recovery-rate-hits-a-new-low/articleshow/88886495.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Another ex-minister falls prey to sextortionists||AHMEDABAD: Sex, lies, and politics: This is what a group of scamsters used to lure a former cabinet minister of Gujarat into a sextortion trap. The victim paid Rs 2.5 lakh before finding out that his online friend was a deepfake avatar created by cybercrooks. The elaborate trap was set up in July when the politician, who held various key posts in the ruling party, was contacted by a woman posing as a party member from Rajasthan. She contacted him during the reshuffle of cabinet in Gujarat. “She pretended to be a party leader, so the politician began chatting with her on a social media platform. Later, he shared his personal WhatsApp number,” said a source in Gujarat police. Top sources said the former minister did not get a berth in new cabinet and was going through a tough time and reportedly got close to the woman. In December, the woman proposed to make a video call to the politician, and he agreed. “When he accepted the call, she disrobed herself and made obscene gestures. On her insistence, the former minister also took off his clothes. A couple of minutes later, the call got disconnected and he received a video in which he was seen watching the naked woman,” said the source. The extortionists askedhim for Rs 5 lakh. He paid them Rs 2 lakh. Earlier, he had paid the woman around Rs 50,000 when she sought financial help. The politician then approached a senior police officer who looked into the case. They found out that the woman was not real. “She had been created through artificial intelligence and a man had been taking the minister for a ride.” Police suspect a gang from Mewat to be behind this scam. Last July, it was revealed that another former minister was trapped by sextortionists. The former minister, a seasoned politician, fell prey to scamsters after accepting a friend’s request in October 2020 from a woman who identified herself as a 30-year-old professional working in Delhi-Gurgaon area. The cybercriminals followed a similar modus operandi to trap the man and demand Rs 2.5 lakh if he did not want his ‘misdeed’ to be made public. He turned to the police department. Senior officers got involved and the blackmailers' accounts were deactivated. The culprits were sent a strong message to steer clear.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/another-ex-minister-falls-prey-to-sextortionists/articleshow/88886384.cms||Ashish Chauhan

But since the pandemic outbreak, keeping celebrations in check while striving to keep the spirits high has become the new normal. This year’s Uttarayan is no different. While enthusiasts are all game about hitting the terrace early in the morning, soaking in the sun and enjoying flying kites, the echoes of kai po che may be muted amid surging Covid-19 cases and a slew of restrictions. With the state government guidelines prohibiting large gatherings on terraces and the use of loudspeakers, Makar Sankranti will be a tad lacklustre than usual this year. “I love kite flying and since I was a child, I haven’t missed celebrating it. Though there will be no loudspeakers or huge gatherings, I am sure it is going to be as lovely flying a kite and enjoying the festivities with my daughter and nephew,” said Jignesh Desai, a Vejalpur resident. On the eve of the festival, markets across Delhi Darwaza, Raipur and Kalupur, were abuzz with buyers. Colourful kites bearing messages encouraging vaccination and staying safe are aplenty here. The overall sales have remained dull in the first 10 days of January. As a consequence, even kite makers have reduced prices to boost sales. And while Covid-19 continues to disrupt travel plans, it doesn’t seem to have dampened the enthusiasm of kite flyers. Residential societies have issued advisories to encourage people to exercise caution. “We have advised the members to avoid gathering extra crowds in the society,” said Chiranjeev Jha, chairman, Richmond Grand Society in Makarba. “Guests won’t be denied entry. Plans have been made to manage the crowds on terraces by allotting time to specific blocks of the apartment,” he said. On the other hand, certain other societies are strict in imposing guidelines. Arvind Chauhan, chairman of a society in Jodhpur, said, “We haven’t organized social events in the past two years. The members are concerned about their safety. We have taken necessary steps like screening at the society gate, frequent sanitation and compulsory masks.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/masti-kai-po-che-d-but-spirits-fly-high/articleshow/88886498.cms||---

These wires snag descending kite strings and prevent them from harming riders,” explains Bhavsar, who works as an air conditioner technician and runs Mission Safe Uttarayan Foundation. This year, he has fastened safety wires on 29 of the 50-odd bridges of the city. The 51-year-old said, “We fasten wires to electric poles on either side of the bridges. However, newer bridges have electric poles in the middle of the divider. So, we have put up banners on these bridges, asking people to ride carefully.” Bhavsar spends about Rs 2,500 per bridge as they need 15kg wire to cover one side of a bridge. “People have been generous with donations,” he said, adding: “It is important to educate people on the dangers of manja. If people ride slowly during this time, fatal accidents can be averted.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/for-15-yrs-hes-been-saving-amdavadis/articleshow/88886500.cms||---

Yashwant Yogi, a resident of municipal labourers quarters in the Memco, filed a complaint against Hardik Chauhan and Ketan Solanki with Shaherkotda police on Thursday. The 47-year-old told police, “The incident took place around 10pm on Wednesday. The two men were celebrating Chauhan’s birthday by playing loud music in an autorickshaw in front of my house. I scolded Chauhan and Solanki for playing loud music and the two went away. “As it was cold, I slept inside my house. Since all the doors were closed, we did not know what was happening outside. We suddenly heard my neighbour scream that someone had set my car on fire.” Yogi rushed out and found that someone had broken the windows of his MUV and set it on fire. His neighbour, Nisha Vachheta, told Yogi that she saw Chauhan and Solanki pouring some liquid on the car and smashing the windows with sticks before throwing a lit match on the vehicle. Yogi called up the city brigade personnel who rushed there and controlled the fire. By the time, the bumper of the car, part of the bonnet and the two front tyres were burnt. He approached police and filed a complaint against Chauhan and Solanki under the IPC sections 435 (mischief by fire or any explosive substance intending to cause damage), 427 (mischief causing damage) and 114 (abetment).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/man-objects-to-noisy-bash-15l-car-set-afire/articleshow/88886501.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Green cover: Ahmedabad biggest loser among mega cities||AHMEDABAD: Among the mega cities in the country, Ahmedabad has been the biggest loser when it comes to forest cover. The city’s forest cover which was 17.86 sq km fell to 9.41 sq km, a 48% fall. Of the seven cities assessed, forest cover increased in mega cities such as Delhi, Chennai, Mumbai and Hyderabad. The reduction in forest cover was revealed in the Forest Survey of India’s ‘State of Forest Report 2021 (IFSR)’. The report for the first time brought out a section on major mega cities. It stated that the decadal change in forest cover from ISFR 2011 to ISFR 2021 showed a 68 sq km increase in forest cover in the seven mega cities. The biggest gain was in Hyderabad (48.66 sq km) and Delhi (19.91 sq km) while Ahmedabad and Bengaluru have lost 8.55 sq km and 4.98 sq km, respectively, the report states. This is the first time the IFSR has specifically covered forest cover in the seven mega cities. Officials in the forest department said that the municipal corporation may have gone in for an urban plantation drive, including the ‘Mission Million Plus Trees’, but this remained on paper. The way the city is expanding and construction activity is on the rise, plantation was not in proportion with urbanisation. An official, citing the 2016 report of the Gujarat forest department, said that built up area — residential, commercial and industrial areas — was 8,168.31 hectares in 2005 and increased by 1,890.12 hectares from 2005 to 2011, to 10,058.43 hectares. It then increased by 4,085.79 hectares from 2011 to 2016, to 14,144.22 hectares. The officer said that due to rapid urbanization, the growing demand for houses, shops and technological advancements in construction, built-up area increased at more than double the rate in the 2011 to 2016 period, compared to the 2005 to 2011 period. At the state level, overall green cover, which includes forest cover and tree cover, increased to 21,870 sq km, or 11.14% of the state’s geographic area. This figure had been stagnant at 21,647 sq km since 2013. In the last two years, the state saw an increase of 223 sq km. However, according to state forest officials, there is no change in dense forest cover, which is defined as a canopy density of over 70%. There was a decline of 60 sq km in moderate forests, where canopy cover is between 40% and 70%. This moderate forest had turned into open forest, which registered an increase. Officials said tree cover in the state is around 5% of the state’s geographical area, while forest cover is 7.57%.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/green-cover-abad-biggest-loser-among-mega-cities/articleshow/88886503.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

This procedure lasted till 5pm,” said Dr Jayesh Sachdeva, dean of BJMC.Sources in the medicine department said that after the interviews, other professors of the department made a written complaint to the dean, saying that Dr Mehta was very hostile and behaved badly with them.Junior doctors alleged that the two-member committee had been formed in an effort to shield Dr Upadhyaya, as Dr Hemant Mehta is a friend of his.Meanwhile, BJMC junior doctors association on Thursday wrote another letter to Sachdeva, alleging that Dr Upadhyaya’s appointment as head of the medicine department was unlawful as he is lower on the order of seniority. The letter alleges that no official appointment order for Dr Upadhyaya has been issued. The letter further seeks an inquiry into how he got the position of HoD. It alleges that if hospital seniority is considered, Dr Neelima Shah would be the rightful HoD, and if GPSC seniority is considered Dr Shivani Patel would be HoD. Junior doctors on Thursday also protested on the Civil Hospital campus and handed out pamphlets to patients on the alleged injustices they have been subjected to by Dr Upadhyaya.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/health-dept-panel-visits-bjmc/articleshow/88886506.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Gir’s canopy thins by 2.5% in 10 years||AHMEDABAD: Lion habitats have registered a decrease of 33.43 sq km (2.52%) of forest cover in the last ten years, according to the latest report of the Forest Survey of India (FSI) released on Thursday. The India State of Forests Report (ISFR) 2021, for the first time, assessed the forest types within Gir National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary. The total area of the national park and wildlife sanctuary was estimated to be 1350.25 sq km. While the park recorded a decline of 2.20 sq km in forest cover, the sanctuary saw a decrease of 31.23 sq km. The report stated that dry teak forest was 11.23% while the dry mixed deciduous forest was 38.21%. The national park according to the report has 12 manmade and 19 natural wetlands. A senior researcher said that with growing population of lions, the reduction of 33.43 sq km was a cause for concern as the state has not been adding any area to the wildlife sanctuary. FSI defines ‘forest cover’ as all lands of a hectare or more with tree patches with canopy density of more than 10 per cent. “The government has declared conservation areas instead of having more wildlife sanctuaries. The state has added Girnar, Mityala and Pania sanctuaries,” he said. The researcher said that reduction in the forest area would mean less space for big cats who are increasingly seen outside sanctuary area and closer to human habitats. Officials said that even the union government’s Project Lion states that the area of the national park should be increased and newer areas outside Gujarat should be identified. However, the state government had rejected the proposal, making it clear that lions were the pride of Gujarat. The officials said that the 2020 count had revealed that the adult male to adult female ratio was estimated to be 1:1.61. This means that with more males in the sanctuary, a lion would require more space for its territory. The 2021 census revealed that the lions’ range spanned 30,000 sq km and they annexed no new territory over the past year. The distribution of lions had increased from 22,000 sq km area in 2015 to about 30,000 sq km in 2020, representing a 36% expansion in the range.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/girs-canopy-thins-by-2-5-in-10-years/articleshow/88886508.cms||---

However, with repeated change in guidelines and permitted guest list reduced from 400 to 50 people as per the guidelines issued by state government of Rajasthan, Patel and his family were left with no choice but to defer the ceremony. “Invitations had already been sent to people. It’s as such a closed circle of family and loved ones and it didn’t seem appropriate to ask some to come and some others not to. We’re now thinking of organizing the wedding in the end of March as the Covid-19 situation eases,” said Puranik. With a rapid spike in Covid-19 cases, even the Gujarat government recently reduced the cap on social gatherings from 400 persons earlier to 150 persons. Increased Covid-19 cases coupled with stringent guidelines has led many families to either defer or downsize wedding ceremonies. Ahmedabad-based Trupti Patel, whose daughter was set to tie the knot on January 22 called off the elaborate wedding ceremony which was planned earlier. “A lot of friends and family members have arrived from the US for the wedding and reducing the number of people is just not possible. We decided to cancel the bookings and keep it an extremely low-key affair with both the families alone with the recent change in guidelines. My daughter is scheduled to leave for the US on January 30 so we’re just holding an intimate ceremony with family members.” City hoteliers suggest that at least 80% of their wedding bookings have either been cancelled or downsized in the wake of changing guideline. “At least 80% weddings have been cancelled across the industry and this is a big loss,” said Narendra Somani, president, Hotels and Restaurants’ Association (HRA), Gujarat. Purva Patel, a city-based wedding planner said, “I was working on a couple of weddings planned in Udaipur and Jaipur for my clients. However, the groups have now decided to defer the occasion in the wake of surging cases. Hotels are offering to organize the events at a later date.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/people-forced-to-defer-downsize-weddings/articleshow/88886509.cms||Niyati Parikh

The district accounts for 39% of the state’s total active cases. Analysis of the overall cases reveals that the eight municipal corporations accounted for 76% of the daily cases – the lowest in 13 days. “Only one district (Botad) did not record any fresh case on Thursday. None of the districts have zero active cases now. It shows that the third wave is fast spreading across the districts. When we compare Ahmedabad or Surat numbers with other districts, we must also keep in mind that the cities carry out about 19,000 daily tests compared to 1,700 in Sabarkantha and 450 in Porbandar,” said a senior public health expert. The state health department stopped giving the Omicron variant break-up in the bulletin, giving the rise to the speculations of the high number of the variant. The experts have long pointed out that due to the nature of the variant, the symptoms are relatively milder, and severity and mortality are very less.

These projects will create 10 lakh direct and indirect employment opportunities in the state, the company said in a media statement. “To make Gujarat net-zero and carbon-free, RIL proposes to invest Rs 5 lakh crore in the state over the span of 10 to 15 years to set up 100GW renewable energy power plant and green hydrogen eco-system development,” the company said in a media statement. The country’s largest private sector company will develop an eco-system for assisting Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and encourage entrepreneurs to embrace new technologies and innovations leading to captive use of renewable energy and green hydrogen. In consultation with government of Gujarat, RIL has started the process of scouting land for 100GW renewable energy power project in Kutch, Banaskantha and Dholera. The company has requested for 4.5 lakh acres of land in Kutch. RIL will invest another Rs 60,000 crore in setting up ‘new energy manufacturing-integrated renewable facilities’ including solar PV module (for manufacture of polysilicon, wafer, cell & module), electrolyzer, energy-storage battery and fuel cells. An additional investment of Rs 25,000 crore investments will be made by RIL in existing projects and new ventures over next 3 to 5 years, it said.

During the last hearing on the suo motu PIL on release of improperly treated wastewater in Sabarmati river causing pollution, the bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice V D Nanavati inquired with the advocate general about the proposed 122-km deep-sea pipeline project. The court was informed that a tender with estimation cost of Rs 1,647.4 crore was invited online by the Gujarat Water Infrastructures Ltd in October 2020. There was no information about what happened after the tender was floated. The high court said, “If this project ultimately sees the light of the day, it may go a long way in tackling the problem of water pollution and more particularly, saving the Sabarmati river . We are not experts and therefore, we would not like to express any opinion as regards the feasibility of this project, etc. However, we would like to know from the state about the current status of the said project.” The court has asked the government to provide information about the project why way of a report or in form of an affidavit on the next hearing on January 21.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/hc-seeks-status-report-on-deep-sea-discharge-project/articleshow/88886518.cms||---

In this case, a 14-year-old girl went missing from her home in April 2019. Her parents lodged an FIR at Gandhigram police station in Rajkot, accusing a Muslim man and two Hindu women of abducting their daughter and detaining her forcibly. The cops registered an FIR against the accused under Sections 363 and 366 of the IPC, for luring away a minor away from her legal guardians’ custody. When Rajkot police did not act, the father of the missing girl approached the high court through advocate Nirav Sanghavi and urged it to direct cops to find the girl. The DCP of Rajkot Zone II was directed to supervise the probe. The court took notice of the fact that the missing girl was not even 15 years old when she went missing and Rajkot police had filed an ‘A’ summary report. Despite the HC’s intervention, Rajkot police could not find the girl. The court said that two and a half years to find a missing girl was a “huge amount of time” that had already been granted to the probe agency. The judges directed CID(crime) on Wednesday to take over the investigation with immediate effect, and directed it to try to bring the missing girl at the earliest.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/missing-girl-probe-given-to-cid-crime/articleshow/88886520.cms||---

Dakshina Kannada District Truck Owners Association president Sunil D’Souza said that there have been reports about the Shiradi Ghat road being closed for six months, for repair works. At a meeting held on Thursday, we told the DC that a complete closure would hit the transportation sector, that is already going through a crisis because of the lockdown. “We urge the authorities to implement a working model, and permit the one-way movement of vehicles. The only option is to travel via Uttara Kannada and Hubballi, which means travelling an additional 200km to reach Bengaluru,” he said. In a letter to deputy commissioner K V Rajendra, the KCCI said the closure of this route that connects the coast with the capital will cause huge inconvenience to citizens and hinder trade, commerce and industrial activities of this region. KCCI president Shashidhar Pai Maroor quoted media reports about the closure of NH-75 from Donigal to Maranahalli, for making it four lanes. ‘’The project is expected to be completed in six months. While we appreciate this project, the six months’ time to repair a 10 km stretch is too long a time. We are of the view that with proper planning, this work can be executed in a much less time,’’ he said It will be devastating if trade activities are affected, as many have already suffered due to lockdowns in the past. They requested the DC to permit cargo movement on the route, while the repairs are being carried out, in order to support trade and prioritise and ensure expediting the work to a timeframe of less than 3-4 months, and permit light vehicles to ply at the earliest, in this period. They also requested to constitute an independent committee by the district administration, to assess the methodology and time requirement of this project completion, and to make concerned NHAI officials and the contractor accountable for any lapse. Deputy commissioner K V Rajendra said that apprehension that the Shiradi Ghat road may be closed has been raised, but no decision has been taken so far by the administration. ‘’We will have to see and verify the report submitted by NHAI on the issue, and then take a call,’’ he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/stakeholders-anxious-over-six-month-closure-of-shiradi-ghat-rd/articleshow/88883951.cms||---
---||Dehradun||U’khand’s forest cover increases marginally by 2sqkm in 2 yrs: Report||Dehradun: Uttarakhand has witnessed a marginal increase in its forest cover by 2sqkm (from 24,303sqkm in 2018 to 24,305sqkm in 2021), revealed - India State of Forest Report 2021, the biennial report of Forest Survey of India . However, there is almost a 37sqkm reduction in the “moderately dense forest (MDF)" (tree canopy density of 40-70%) of the state due to development activities. Roads have penetrated forests and mining has also expanded across various forest stretches, thus the MDF patch has taken a back seat, according to senior IFS officers. It is a patch of all lands with a tree canopy density of 40 per cent and more but less than 70 per cent as per the FSI. Experts say reducing the MDF is a matter of concern as it acts as a cushion for dense forests of the state. In case, Uttarakhand loses the MDF, it will impact almost 1,600 plus elephants, over 200 tigers and over 800 leopards along with array of other wildlife whose habitat also comprises the MDF.  As per the 2021 assessment, Uttarakhand has a total forest cover of 24,305, which is 45.44% of the geographical area of the state. There is a change in the forest cover of 2sqkm as per the report, which is a meagre change of 0.01%, with very dense forest cover being 5,055, MDF 12,768 and open forest 6,482. Very dense forest comprises all lands with a tree canopy density of 70 per cent and above. While in the previous assessment of 2019, very dense forest was 5,047, MDF 12,805 and open forest 6,451. A sharp dip of -37sqkm has been observed in the MDF and an increase of 8sqkm in very dense forest and 31sqkm in open forest. There is an increase in very dense forest and open forest covers, which the forest experts say is a good sign as it indicates the robust ecosystem of very dense forests. Open forest comprises all lands with a tree canopy density of 10 per cent and more but less than 40 per cent. They are also increasing in Uttarakhand, which is good but requires attention of caretakers to ensure prolonged sustenance and survival, feel experts. Countrywide, Madhya Pradesh has the largest forest cover, followed by Arunachal Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha and Maharashtra, as per the report. The total forest cover of the country as per the current assessment of the FSI is 7,13,789sqkm, which is 21.71 per cent of the total geographic area of the country. In terms of canopy density classes, area covered by very dense forest is 99,779sqkm (3.04%), MDF is 3,06,890sqkm (9.33 per cent). “In the current assessment, very dense forest and moderately dense forest together constitute 57 per cent of the total forest cover of the country as per the ISFR 2021.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/ukhands-forest-cover-increases-marginally-by-2sqkm-in-2-yrs-report/articleshow/88883958.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Nagpur||From 4L to 5L Covid cases in 258 days, slowest for dist||Nagpur: The Covid-19 caseload of Nagpur district crossed the 5-lakh mark on Wednesday when over 1,400 new infections were reported. Infections increased from 4 lakh to 5 lakh in 258 days, which is the longest timespan for a lakh cases since the onset of the pandemic in the district.The district had reported its first case on March 11, 2020. The first one lakh cases came 235 days later on October 31, 2020. The quickest jump of 1 lakh cases was in 14 days — from 3 lakh to 4 lakh — in April last year during the peak of second wave. The highest monthly cases – 1.88 lakh – were recorded in April 2021, which is 37% of total cases.On Thursday, the district reported over 2,000 cases for the first time after March 12 last year. This took the caseload for January so far to 8,856 which is now more than any month from June to December last year.The doubling speed of cases had come to nearly standstill between June and December-end last year. The lowest number of 145 cases were recorded in August during this period.From just 66 active cases on December 15, the tally has touched 7,303 as on Thursday. Of these, 439 patients are in institutional isolation or hospital. The number of hospitalization is even less and not many patients are critical as per officials.Infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde said that the number of cases doesn’t matter much now. “Rising cases are ‘casedemic’. We now need a daily bulletin on number of Covid hospitalization. That should give us an alarm and idea if restrictions are actually needed. The drawback of increase in cases is that the number of vulnerable patients requiring hospitalization will go up,” he said.Dr Shinde also called for a revision in reporting of Covid cases too. “We are still following the same format. The public is not aware exactly what is happening as far as Covid scenario is concerned. Omicron has rapidly spread and hardly any complications are seen. The viral load span has reduced to just three days. By the time test report comes, the patient’s viral load is negligible. Therefore, the spread is not stopping and there is not point in isolating a patient after this period. Clinicians are also not stressing on Covid test to mild patients,” he said.

---||Nagpur||59-year-old cancer patient dies of Covid||Nagpur: A 59-year-old comorbid man passed away of Covid-19 at a private hospital late on Wednesday evening. The deceased, a resident of Pratap Nagar, was fully vaccinated. A known case of throat cancer, the deceased had been admitted to hospital with complaints of breathlessness and brought with tracheostomy.This was the first Covid death of a Nagpur resident after August 12, 2021. This took the city’s Covid toll to 5,895 and district’s to 10,125. Though a couple of deaths were reported in Nagpur, the deceased belonged to other districts. The hospital told TOI that the 59-year-old was admitted following pneumonia. “He was brought with O2 support on January 9. A Covid test was done same day and he tested positive. He was given remdesivir but his condition didn’t improve. He was put on ventilator but he passed away on January 12 night,” the hospital said.The district health office (DHO) added only this death to the Covid count while Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) data erroneously mentioned two Covid deaths in the day.A 79-year-old resident of Siddartha Nagar in Ashi Nagar zone was taken as the other Covid death of the city. NMC chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar said the elderly man was a case of incidental finding, and it would be reconciled.The 79-year-old man had been admitted to IGGMCH medicine ward on January 12 following a heart attack at home. “He passed away the same night while his RTPCR report came positive on Thursday. It is an incidental finding and can’t be taken as a Covid death,” IGGMCH officials said.  A relative confirmed to TOI that the man was fully vaccinated three months ago, and wasn’t a Covid patient at the time of admission. “The hospital later called up to say that his sample came positive,” the relative said.The NMC zonal medical team wasn’t able to trace the family, which was busy in final rites. This lead to confusion regarding the man’s Covid status. The relative said the body wasn’t handed over to them but taken directly to the crematorium.This is the fifth case this month when Covid positive status came to be known as incidental finding after the person had passed away due to other causes. Officials said such cases will increase with the Omicron spread.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/59-year-old-cancer-patient-dies-of-covid/articleshow/88883957.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Nagpur||43,336 fined for not wearing masks in 16 mths, fined Rs2cr||Nagpur: Rising Covid cases and repeated appeals to wear face masks have failed to rein in irresponsible Nagpurians. The Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s (NMC) Nuisance Detection Squad (NDS) has recovered Rs2 crore fine from errant Nagpurians for not wearing masks in the last 16 months. On Thursday, NDS penalized 67 citizens for the offence and recovered Rs33,500 as fine.“The Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s NDS penalised 43,336 citizens for not wearing masks in the last 16 months (from September 2020 to January 13, 2022),” said NDS commandant Virsen Tambe.TOI too has been highlighting the importance of masks and publishing news about crowded places, where citizens blatantly disobey the mandatory Covid-19 guidelines.General physician Dr Sanjeeb Ukil pointed out that when Covid cases are rising at an alarming rate, mask adherence and distancing are the most important tools that can help in bringing the cases down.“It is very disappointing to see people moving around without masks or not following social distancing when the city is facing another spike in Covid-19 cases,” said a miffed Dr Ukil.People must understand the importance of wearing masks. According to him, people must remember that the virus has destroyed lakhs of families in the previous two waves. “So people must follow Covid-appropriate behaviour religiously,” he said. The highest number of citizens flouting the disobeying mask rule were from Laxmi Nagar (6,051) and Dharampeth (5,792) zones, revealed data obtained from NMC.Even residents venturing out in Hanuman Nagar (4,321) and Mangalwari (4,304) zones too earned dubious distinction for not wearing masks.The NDS team caught 424 citizens, mostly NMC employees, at its administrative building in Civil Lines. “They coughed up over Rs2 lakh fines too,” said Tambe, ruling out any mercy from the NDS team for the violators of Covid Appropriate Behaviour.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/43336-fined-for-not-wearing-masks-in-16-mths-fined-rs2cr/articleshow/88883945.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: One more tiger poached; canine, whiskers missing||NAGPUR: A tiger was poached on Thursday as it was found with its claws, canines and whiskers missing. The incident took place in Arjuni Morgaon range of Gondia in the Navegaon-Nagzira Tiger Reserve (NNTR) landscape. This is the third tiger death in the last 13 days. On January 3, a young tigress was electrocuted in Bhadravati (Chandrapur) and another died in an alleged territorial fight in the Porla range in Gadchiroli two days later. The tiger carcass was noticed around 9 am. On Thursday morning forest staff learned about the death from villagers. The carcass was 500 metres away from agriculture fields and indications are that it was killed elsewhere and dumped on the forest land, according to sources. Forest guard RD Rane and others found that the upper canines and whiskers of the animal were missing. An attempt was also made by the poachers to chop one of the paws. Even as officials including NNTR field director RM Ramanujam, Gondia deputy conservator (DyCF) Kulraj Singh, honorary wildlife wardens Sawan Bahekar and Mukund Dhurve reached the spot, veterinarians were missing despite being repeatedly called. Hence, post-mortem could not be conducted. “The carcass has been kept at the same spot and the post-mortem will be done on Friday. Only one local livestock development officer was present and he refused to conduct the post-mortem as two more were needed as per protocol. The veterinarians arrived at 4.30 pm. As they wouldn’t have completed the task before darkfall, we decided to defer the post-mortem,” said Ramanujam. Ramanujam said that the five-year-old tiger seems to have been electrocuted first and later attempts were made to remove its body parts. RFO BT Durge is investigating. It was feared that the tiger must be from Navegaon National Park but it turned out to be an unrecorded one moving along the Wadsa-Navegaon corridor. Sources from the spot said they heard tiger roars by evening indicating there may be a female in the same area. “There were pugmarks near the carcass of male tigers,” they said. The incident occurred days after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray addressed senior police and forest officials and state wildlife board members asking them to pull their socks and intensify joint patrolling.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/one-more-tiger-poached-canine-whiskers-missing/articleshow/88885273.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

Judge R Jayakrishnan issued this directive after he noticed that the survivor lacked a sound mind to give her statements. The survivor, a person with learning disabilities, who is currently aged 22, had allegedly faced sexual abuse from two of her neighbours in the year 2013 when she was only 15. She was studying in class VI when she faced the abuse. Her mother too is suffering from the same mental condition. Poojapura police registered a case and arrested the accused after the girl’s teachers and classmates noticed the abuse marks on her face and neck and enquired about it. The trial of the accused was scheduled to commence on Thursday. Soon after the session started, the judge noticed that the woman was giving incoherent statements. The judge then asked her about her favourite things in life and her ambitions to make her relax. She told the judge that she loved to have Maggi noodles and wished to learn driving and karate. When asked why karate, she replied that she wanted to beat up the men who violated her. Special public prosecutor R S Vijay Mohan then stated that the survivor was in need of psychiatric treatment, but her family was in no condition to provide her treatment. Her condition grew worse following the sexual abuse. She and her mother are under the care of her grandmother, who is aged 90. The judge directed the psychiatry wing authorities at Medical College Hospital to provide her treatment and also directed the police to provide them needed assistance.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/pocso-court-orders-psychiatric-aid-for-rape-survivor/articleshow/88884692.cms||---

Established in 1978 by renowned ornithologist Salim Ali, the mini-zoo gets the major part of its revenues from entry tickets and other nature and wildlife awareness programmes. It started a fund-raising programme earlier this week to stay afloat. The centre, located in the Jodhpur Tekra area, is run by the Centre for Environment Education (CEE), and Karmakshetra Educational Foundation. “All our activities had a major setback due to Covid. The flow of visitors has also dipped in the past two years due to Covid. To cope with this crisis, we are reaching out to people to make donations. Average monthly expenditure is about Rs 5 lakh for maintenance and security, cleaning staff, electricity, wages, etc. The cost of food for the animals is about Rs 1 lakh per month,” said Suresh Nair, senior programme co-ordinator, Sundervan programme of Centre for Environmental Education (CEE). Sundarvan programmes are funded by CEE, and the major portion of funding came through a central government scheme that was scrapped a few years ago. As a result, programmes like ‘green birthday’ celebrations, overnight camping, nature trail walks, bat awareness program, spider watch, bird watching, tree identification and school visits became the major source of funds for the mini zoo. This was beside revenue from tickets. “Sundarvan is not at a stage where it is facing imminent closure. But there are financial issues and a fund-raising programme started recently is showing positive results. Assistance is also needed to make it the first-rate facility it should be,” said Kartikeya Sarabhai, founder director of CEE. Through social media and other platforms, Sundarvan authorities have urged people and organizations to contribute even by way of adopting their animals by bearing their maintenance costs for a minimum of one month. Sundarvan is recognized as a mini-zoo by the Central Zoo Authority (CZA) and houses birds, mammals and reptiles. It also has an aquarium and a butterfly park amid thick vegetation of many species of trees. The zoo has been an education platform for many people who once played on these grounds and have grown up to be nature-conscious citizens and now bring their children here. “People often ask me about the compact size of Sundarvan. I tell them that people go to a temple to get a peek into the mysteries of the universe. Similarly, the Sundarvan centre has become a point of first contact to see nature as a whole for many who have grown up to be birdwatchers and snake lovers,” said Sarabhai. Three months ago, the snake park at Sundarvan was refurbished and redesigned in a project funded by Wagh Bakri Tea Group as part of its corporate social responsibility (CSR).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/pandemic-crunch-sundarvan-raising-funds/articleshow/88886524.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Posco, Adani join hands for $5 billion steel project in Gujarat||AHMEDABAD: After Tata Motors shifted its factory to Sanand in Gujarat in 2008, following violent protests at Singur in West Bengal, another big-ticket investment project, this time by South Korean steel giant Posco, has come calling to Gujarat, seeking a fresh lease of life for its steel project in India. For this, the steel-maker has joined hands with billionaire Gautam Adani-led Adani Group and on Thursday they announced the signing an agreement to establish an integrated steel mill at Mundra and to explore cooperation in other businesses. The pact envisages an estimated investment of $5 billion. Posco’s plans for the steel project in India have been blocked for many years now due to protests by farmers and land acquisition issues in states such as Odisha and Karnataka. Presently, the South Korean major runs POSCO-Maharashtra, a 1.8-million-ton cold-rolled and galvanized mill regarded as the most advanced automotive steel supplier in India, and four processing centres, at Pune, Delhi, Chennai and Ahmedabad. “We are very pleased to announce the partnership with POSCO, the world’s most efficient and advanced steel manufacturer, in steel production and carbon reduction,” said Gautam Adani, chairman, Adani Group. The business cooperation between the two is anticipated to create a dominant partnership synergy in the Indian steel industry. The project will also mark Adani Group’s foray into the steel manufacturing business. “Posco and Adani Group aim to set up a 5 million tonne steel plant in Kutch in the initial phase. The plant will require large amounts of hydrogen and given Adani Group’s huge plans to produce the cheapest hydrogen in the near future, it makes good business sense. The proposed project will be green and environment-friendly,” said an industry official aware of the matter. Adani Group also runs the country’s largest private commercial port at Mundra and given its proximity to the upcoming steel plant, raw material supply or even exports will not be a challenge, he further said. The non-binding memorandum of understanding (MoU) between Adani and POSCO envisages further collaboration at the group business level in industries such as renewable energy, hydrogen, and logistics, in response to carbon reduction requirements. The Adani Group chairman also added that the partnership will contribute to the growth of India’s manufacturing industry and the Aatmanirbhar Bharat scheme championed by the government of India. “It will also help to strengthen India’s standing in green businesses,” Adani said. Both parties are also examining options to cooperate and leverage technical, financial, and operational strengths of each company. POSCO and Adani intend to utilize renewable energy resources and green hydrogen, in line with both partners’ ESG commitments to sustainability and energy efficiency. “POSCO and Adani are able to come to great synergy in the steel and environment-friendly business with POSCO’s state-of-the-art technology in steel making and Adani’s expertise in energy and infrastructure. I hope this cooperation will be a good and sustainable business cooperation model between India and South Korea,” said Jeong-woo, Choi, CEO, POSCO. Meanwhile, POSCO and Adani have also signed an MoU with the government of Gujarat for support and cooperation for the collaboration.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/posco-adani-join-hands-for-5bn-steel-project-in-guj/articleshow/88886527.cms||---

Shopping malls, roads and wayside outlets were overcrowded, with long queues in front of them cutting a sorry figure.  Jagadamba Junction in city where garment malls are concentrated witnessed serpentine queues of buyers. There was no one to enforce Covid-19 norms. Some customers justified the jostling saying it is a big festival and how can one keep off shopping. Sankranti is considered the major festival of Andhra people. A large number of seafood lovers thronged the fishing harbour in city. “There was no social distancing, and some were seen without masks. It has to be seen whether Covid-19 cases will surge after the Sankranti festival as most of the people have been ignoring the protocols,” said K Siva Kumar, a resident of Vizag city.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/shoppers-flout-covid-norms-in-vizag-city/articleshow/88886530.cms||Nalla.Babu

Taking advantage of the situation, private bus and taxi operators hiked the fares abnormally in the past few days. Each person has to spend an extra 1,000 to 1,500 towards fares in buses from Hyderabad to Vizag and other destinations. According to an estimation, around one lakh people would come to various destinations in AP from Telangana, especially from Hyderabad, during the Sankranti festival days. Though the railways has extended festival special trains, there is a waiting list in almost all the trains from January 7 to January 16, with chances of seat confirmation being very low. South central railways used to run almost 400 special trains during Christmas to Sankranthi on normal days, but the pandemic conditions restricted its services and now it is running only 200 trains. East coast railways is also running 100 to 120 trains. Both zones are adding one or two services every day, but the demand is more. Even APSRTC and Telangana RTC are running more than 200 services a day. “Though there are seats and sleeper tickets available with private buses, many operators are creating artificial crisis and looting the public, a retired employee, G Srinivas, alleged. “With no other option, my daughter and son-in-law bought tickets each costing 2,900,” he said. Non-AC bus fare from Vizag to Hyderabad was around 1,000, but now it is 1,800 to 2,000. “We are conducting checks on private travel buses at various places. Most of the vehicles violate norms on number of passengers, second driver and others,” a motor vehicle inspector said. Meanwhile, officials imposed fines on more than 50 private travel buses across AP on Thursday morning, including 13 buses in Vizag.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/private-travel-buses-fleece-holiday-crowds/articleshow/88886532.cms||Siva G

---||Ranchi||More symptomatic patients in Dhanbad, W S’bhum: Govt data||Ranchi: The recent Covid-19 cases all over the state were found to be less severe and most patients are asymptomatic, according to the figures released by the state health department on Wednesday.The release said only 4.10% patients in the state are symptomatic while 3.23% of them are admitted to a government or private facility for treatment. Despite fewer patients turning symptomatic, four districts in Jharkhand have a huge chunk of symptomatic patients and coincidently these districts are those where pollution levels due to mining are known to be high. Dhanbad with 16.53%, West Singhbhum with 13%, Latehar with 11.84% and Giridih with 11.76% symptomatic patients top the chart while Sahebganj does not have any symptomatic patient and the figure is as low as 0.41% in Hazaribag and 0.56% in Seraikela.Head, state Covid centre at Rajendra Institute of Medical Science (RIMS), Dr Pradeep Bhattacharya, said there are chances of people suffering from pre-existing respiratory conditions in industrial cities or those known to have poor ambient air quality. “Though this could be one reason for more people being symptomatic in Dhanbad and Giridih, how the data has been collected and reported also matters. If there are no pre-fixed criteria of reporting symptoms — the interpretation may go wrong,” he said.Though the number of symptomatic patients is high in the four districts, no patient in these districts are admitted in hospitals on oxygen-supported beds. All the patients who are on oxygen-supported beds are in East Singhbhum and Ranchi where the share of symptomatic patients is 6.62% and 2.07% respectively indicating that despite being symptomatic, the patients in the mining districts are not severely ill.Head, preventive and social medicine (PSM) at Rims, Dr Devesh Kumar also cast doubts over the figures of asymptomatic patients. “It is difficult to believe that 96% of the Covid-positive patients are asymptomatic because what was the need for them to get tested? Deciding symptoms depends upon the treating physician and may be they have not considered fever or scratchy throat as symptoms in some cases,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/more-symptomatic-patients-in-dhanbad-w-sbhum-govt-data/articleshow/88886540.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

A high-level meeting of the party leaders on Thursday in Delhi finalized discussion on 172 seats. These seats were mostly from the first three phases of the polls, sources told TOI. According to sources, as reported by TOI on Thursday, Adityanath is likely to be fielded from Ayodhya and Maurya from Sirathu constituency. Maurya had won from Sirathu in 2012. Sharma may contest from one of the assembly constituencies in Lucknow. Sources said that the final stamp on the decision taken in principle would be taken by the top BJP leadership including the PM. Addressing the media at the BJP headquarters after the meeting, Maurya said the party held wider deliberations on the 172 assembly seats and would register a bigger victory than the 2017 assembly polls. The meeting was attended virtually by JP Nadda and Rajnath Singh and Nitin Gadkari as they have contracted the coronavirus. Home minister Amit Shah and several other leaders besides those from Uttar Pradesh, including Yogi were physically present in the meeting. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was also present virtually in the meeting, sources said. The party is of the view that top state leaders contesting elections would send a positive signal among the party workers. Besides, Yogi's candidature from Ayodhya would only augment BJP's Hindutva agenda that the party has kept in the core in this assembly election. As for Sharma's seat, sources said that it was still not confirmed from which he would contest but party insiders said he could contest from either Lucknow North, Lucknow East or Bakshi Ka Talab. The party has also decided to repeat ministers like Suresh Rana from Thana Bhawan. However, a final decision on Bhupendra Chaudhary's candidature is yet to be taken, sources confirmed. Sources said that there are chances that the list of the candidates could be released on Friday, however, it is certain that if the list is not released on Friday, it would be released on January 15. The first list would contain names mostly from the first phase while it will also have names from the second and third phases of elections, sources concluded.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/bjp-caps-172-names-yogi-from-ayodhya-keshav-from-sirathu/articleshow/88888188.cms||Rajiv Srivastava

---||Ranchi||Traders oppose govt plan to follow Chhattisgarh model for liquor trade||Ranchi: The Hemant Soren government is preparing to take over the sale of liquor in Jharkhand on lines of the Chhattisgarh model but the move has run into opposition from retail liquor traders citing how similar attempts by the previous BJP government led to heavy losses to the state exchequer.Recently, a team from the state excise department returned from Chattisgarh after a field study of the liquor policy there and submitted its report to the state government. While the government is still to officially announce its future course of action, sources in the excise department said the new policy will soon be announced and tabled before the cabinet.Excise minister Jagarnath Mahto’s phone remained switched off while the state excise department secretary Vinay Kumar Choubey didn’t receive calls but a departmental source said the move is to increase revenue. “The idea behind the government’s move to regulate the liquor trade by taking it over is to ensure fair play and plug leakages in revenue,” said an official.Liquor traders, however, maintained that the government must take lessons from its earlier experience when it ran into heavy losses after taking over the trade. In 2017, the previous Raghuabar Das government took over the liquor trade and ran it through the state beverage corporation limited, but results were disappointing. Besides fiscal losses, it also had to face the opposition’s wrath, including that of the ruling JMM, currently helmed by Hemant Soren. As a result, the government withdrew it in 2019.“The reveneu in 2020-2 was slightly less but was good despite Covid-19 induced lockdown for months,” said Subodh Jaiswal, secretary of Jharkhand Khudra Sharab Vikreta, an outfit of liquor retailers.He added that rather than blindly following another state’s model and incur losses, the government must plug in its own apparatus to prevent leakages.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/traders-oppose-govt-plan-to-follow-chhattisgarh-model-for-liquor-trade/articleshow/88886543.cms||ASRP Mukesh
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: Govt schools mull online classes in morning & evening to suit students||RANCHI: Several government schools are likely to alter their classroom routine in order to improve participation of students during online classes. The state government has closed down all schools due to a steep rise in Covid cases. Following the government’s decision, the Jharkhand Project Education Council on Tuesday directed the education officers to strengthen the online classroom system in view of the upcoming annual examinations. The education department is supplying study materials through a group Digi-Saath with a direction that they should be forwarded to students through WhatsApp. The online classes are held through various applications, including Google Meet and Zoom. School principals said many students are unable to join the classes due to lack of smartphones and laptops. Even if the parents concerned have the phones, they take those along with them for work. Under the circumstances, classes should be conducted in the morning and the evening hours when the parents are at home, they said. Principal of Zila School, Deepa Choudhary, said, “Lack of smartphones and poor connectivity are major bottlenecks faced by students during online classes. Those studying in lower classes, in general, do not have their own mobile phones. We would take feedback from the students when they are in a position to attend classes so that changes are made in the routine.” Expressing similar views principal of Middle School, Pandra Ashok Singh, said preparing the students for the upcoming tests is the sole job of teachers. He said, “I am of the view that online classes should not start before 5 pm. Online classes cannot be an adequate substitute for offline classes and it will be a real challenge to ensure participation of a large number of students in the exercise.” District education officer AV Bilung said the schools have the flexibility regarding class routine. He said, “If schools get feedback that number of students will increase by adjusting the routine, they should go ahead with it. Our aim is to reach out to a maximum number of students.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/govt-schools-mull-online-classes-in-morning-evening-to-suit-students/articleshow/88886544.cms||Sanjay Sahay

The move has not gone down well with the workers and the various workers’ unions. Citu- affiliated Hatia Mazdoor Union president Bhawan Singh said, “This is not a healthy sign. During the negotiations on January 11, it was agreed that no disciplinary actions would be initiated against the workers or trade union representatives. However, HEC seems to be going back on its promises fast.” On January 10, HEC released back wages of workers for August 2021. However, wages of Harendra Prasad Yadav and Mahendra Kumar, both leaders of the CITU-affiliated Hatia Mazdoor Union and K P Sahu of AITUC-affiliated Hatia Kamgar Union along with three other contract workmen have been withheld. No reason has been given by HEC for such arbitrary action, Singh said.He added, “A meeting of the core group of workers belonging to all eight registered trade unions operating at HEC has been called on Friday to take stock of the situation.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/hec-withholds-strike-leaders-wages/articleshow/88886545.cms||Tapas Biswas

The citizens there need to take more care.

I have requested the CM to develop an elephant park there just like one in Sri Lanka and to allot Rs 50 crore for the project. It would be another tourist destination after completion and CM is very positive on the project,” he said.On farmers suffering losses due to unseasonal rains, Wadettiwar said his department had already conveyed to all collectors in the state to conduct inspection and file reports as early as possible. “The farmers would get compensation as per rules of the state disaster relief fund (SDRF).”On reopening schools in state, Wadettiwar said the CM would take a decision.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/restrictions-to-continue-till-covid-situation-normalises-wadettiwar/articleshow/88883964.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Nagpur||Wake up and procure medicines, equipment for Vidarbha Government Medical College and Hospitals: HC||NAGPUR: Severely censuring the Haffkine Institute and Maharashtra government for failure to deliver important equipment and essential items like hand gloves to various Government Medical College and Hospitals (GMCHs) in Vidarbha, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Thursday asked them to wake up and make efforts to procure those in view of Covid third wave hitting the state. “When the third wave of pandemic has already started and is getting intense every passing day, the Haffkine as well as the government’s machinery have to wake up and make efforts in procuring all the requisite medicines and essential equipment, necessary for effectively combating the contagion,” a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Anil Pansare said. The reprimanding came while a plea (WP no 3427/2000) regarding lack of basic facilities in GMCHs where amicus curiae Anup Gilda pointed out a crisis in supply of essential medical equipment, articles and even medicines. “Haffkine has been lagging behind the schedule and delay which has been caused in some cases has been of about two years. Therefore, the explanation now being submitted by it that on account of lesser attendance of its employees it could not complete the process for procurement of the requisite items cannot be accepted,” the bench noted. Before adjourning the hearing till January 25, the judges directed State Medical Education and Drugs Department secretary to supply all the essential medicines, equipment, gloves, IV Fluids and other gadgets, as demanded by all the GMCHs in Vidarbha, including two in the city and one each in Akola and Yavatmal, within seven days. “In case of failure, the secretary shall be required to personally attend this court for initiating necessary action in the matter,” they warned. About lack of fire-fighting equipment at GMCH and IGGMCH here, the justices told PWD to initiate and complete the installation process within three months since the administrative approvals were received and funds were made available by the government. Regarding bids received for installation of robotic surgery system at GMCH here, HC asked the concerned committee to complete technical evaluation of three bids received in the tender process within four weeks and taken to its logical end in the next one month. Earlier, additional government pleader Deepak Thakare informed that although IV Fluids, as required by the GMCHs have been supplied by the Haffkine Institute, there has been some deficit in supply of masks and surgical equipment, including gloves. Quoting the communication received from the Parel-based biomedical research institute, Thakare said it could not procure the items earlier on account of lesser attendance of its employees due to Covid-19 pandemic, but now has geared itself up in expediting the process. While blaming the Haffkine, the procuring authority for GMCHs, for being lethargic in clearing the pending dues of suppliers, due to which they stopped all supplies, Gilda brought to fore that the Vidarbha GMCHs were acute facing a crisis of general surgical gadgets, IV fluids, hand gloves and other items. Adding that the poor patients were suffering in absence of essential equipment and medicines, he demanded directives to the government and Haffkine to clear pending dues so that there is no crunch of drugs and other surgical material in the region’s hospitals. # What HC said: * Covid-19 3rd already started & is getting intense every passing day * Haffkine, govt must procure medicines & equipment for fighting virus * Mumbai-based institute has been lagging behind schedule for delivery * Delay caused in some cases has been of about two years * Its explanation of staff shortage due to pandemic can’t be accepted * Govt must supply these items to Vidarbha’s GMCHs in two weeks * In case of failure, med secy to remain present in next hearing||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/wake-up-procure-medicines-equipment-for-vid-gmchs-hc/articleshow/88883962.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Shaiju Khan was later shifted to Thiruvananthapuram Medical College Hospital where he is undergoing treatment. “A note was recovered from the room in which it was mentioned that the family was under financial crisis,’’ the inspector said. Shaiju Khan earlier worked in Saudi Arabia. Three years ago he returned home. Though he ventured into many businesses none of it succeeded. Lately, the couple had been running a textile shop and a juice stall at Vilachikkala.

---||Indore||Indore: Repeat Covid-19 testing unscientific, unnecessary, says expert||INDORE: Even though most of Covid-19 infected ones are mild in nature, the district has been witnessing a high number of repeat positive cases for the last two weeks. The district has reported 383 repeat positive cases of Covid-19 infections at an average of 32 infections on a daily basis till Wednesday, shows daily health bulletin record. Interestingly, the repeat positive numbers are on a higher side on the days when the district reported more infections in between. The district on Wednesday reported 68 repeat positive cases- that was highest since January 1, when 1104 fresh Covid-19 infections were found. A senior health official involved in the sampling process told TOI, “Repeat positive cases are those, who re-test positive with Covid-19 infection after a couple of days.” “There is no mandate for re-test to get negative reports. There are, however, three reasons behind this high number of repeat positive cases including to confirm negative reports for self belief, for organisation before joining back”, official said. “The other reason is the shifting of Covid-19 patients to normal wards. The hospital administration tests patients and they are found to be positive again”, claimed the official. HoD medicine department MGMMC Dr VP Pandey told TOI, “Dead virus remained in the respiratory tract. So, if samples are collected and tested these tests are sensitive enough to detect this testing positive.” “This kind of testing is unscientific, unnecessary, and against the guidelines of ICMR as well as the union government and shouldn’t be done”, said Dr Pandey. The guidelines suggested that anybody could be discharged from hospital from three to seven days, if a person doesn’t have fever for three days in a row. Repeat testing is not recommended in case of symptomatic positive also in guidelines, said Dr Pandey. About the effect of this repeat testing Dr Pandey said, “The repeat testing only increases anxiety of patients. It also has a cost effect and should be avoided.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/indore/repeat-covid-19-testing-unscientific-unnecessary-expert/articleshow/88886555.cms||Antriksh Singh

ICMR on January 11 in a document titled advisory on purposive testing strategy for Covid-19 waiving off mandatory testing of asymptomatic patients undergoing surgical / non-surgical invasive procedures including pregnant women in/near labour. HoD respiratory medicine SAIMS Dr Ravi Dosi told TOI, “The testing strategy is revised on a very good time and could prove fruitful for asymptomatic patients including comorbid ones.” “Mandatory testing of all patients in hospital settings during waves earlier caused unnecessary delays in treatment of existing diseases in morbid asymptomatic patients”, said Dr Dosi. “The surgeries, and dialysis are delayed till reports are received. And, if the patient turns out positive then it is delayed for a week or two depending on guidelines than”, said Dr Dosi. “The asymptomatic cases however remained without any symptoms and the Covid-19 infection in these people are not causing any major issue. So, this is a welcome move but should be followed scientifically”, Dr Dosi said. “It shouldn’t be followed blindly. The decision should be based on clinical diagnosis and physician discretion as advised in the new policy”, Dr Dosi added. The effect of mandatory testing in case of morbid patients are more. Because it affects proper management of their existing disease because of high case load in Covid-19 facilities. “In case of comorbid patients like those suffering from heart ailment, renal issues test Covid-19 positive they get shifted to Covid-19 facilities, where he will get compromised care for his morbid condition increasing chances of severity and fatalities”, said HoD respiratory medicine MGMMC Dr Salil Bhargava. “The morbid patients suffered even during the second wave after Covid-19 infection. So, this change in testing policy will be helpful to these people.”, added Dr Bhargava.  A crisis committee meeting on January 3, members discussed arrangements for treatment of comorbid patients, pregnant women, and asked the district admin to reserve hospitals for them during possible peaks.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/indore/new-testing-policy-must-be-implemented-scientifically/articleshow/88886557.cms||Antriksh Singh

ICMR on January 11 revising its policy waived off testing of asymptomatic contacts of confirmed positive case except high risk (either 60 plus or comorbid) may have a major impact in sample collection from community. MGM dean Dr Sanjay Dixit commenting on revised policy said, “The new policy is well in time and will have its effect. Because of the high transmissibility rate of Omicron variant causing surge this time testing of asymptomatic persons is unwise unless warranted.”  “Because of implementation of this policy, the sample collection through government set up will have a major impact. The sampling teams collect samples through contact tracing, now”, said Dr Dixit. “If asymptomatic contacts are waived from sampling, a major chunk will remain untested. It will lower the positive case number and ultimately could impact estimated peak value in the long run”, added Dr Dixit. There are 48 Rapid response teams for contact tracing and sampling in the district. They have collected around 10,000 samples on a daily basis for the last one week or so. It was estimated that the district might have 5000 Covid-19 cases in a day during peak up from 1826 infections last year in the second wave. A senior health official however said, "RRTs are following the same protocol as earlier for sample collection. There is no change for now and not even direction for it."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/indore/new-testing-policy-may-reduce-covid-peak-value/articleshow/88886558.cms||Antriksh Singh

According to authorities of Child Welfare Committee (CWC), a quasi-judicial body, and Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (KSCPCR), they have received scores of cases of minor marriages and cases of abuse. Minor girls, after running away with boys of their choice in order to marry, have ended up being abused in several cases, they said. CWC has received more than 1,000 complaints concerning children below the age of 18 and many cases of elopement including minor marriages and abuse cases. CWC members say on many occasions they have passed orders in three to four cases on the custody of minor girls, in a single day, which is a reason for worry. They said it is important for parents and teachers to take children into confidence during their adolescent period, give orientation about sex education, and keep a tab on their behaviour regularly to prevent cases of elopement. The minor victims have told them that they ran away from their homes because their parents were planning to marry them off to other boys or opposed their relationships. CWC president HT Kamala said the elopement cases are a cause of concern as it leads to child abuse and minor marriages. “Minor girls require proper orientation from both parents and teachers. We have received cases of children studying between Class 8 and 12 from both urban and rural areas in equal numbers,” she said. CWC member E Dhananjaya said the committee has received 1,034 such cases in 2021. “Many of them are related to elopement, abuse, and minor marriage apart from cases of missing, running away from home, and pushing children to begging,” he said. Cases of child labour are fewer. In several cases, Provisions of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences are invoked because the girls are minor. The boys are booked for abduction, procuring a minor child and rape if the girl is reported to be abused. KSCPCR member ML Parashuram said about 67 Pocso cases were registered in Mysuru district, 56 in Kodagu and 50 in Chamarajanagar in 2021. Apart from this, 13 cases of child marriages were reported in Chamarajanagar and two in Kodagu, he stated.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/cases-of-minors-eloping-rises-in-mysuru-district/articleshow/88886564.cms||Lawrence Milton

While UDF and BJP councillors welcomed the agenda to rent a home for the mayor, they questioned the delay in completing the project ‘Mayor’s Bhavan’ at Kunnukuzhy. BJP councillors said that the project was almost two decades old and it was unfortunate that the LDF which ruled the council all these years could not get the project done till date. They alleged that it was the delay in the completion of the project which led to mayor having to rent out a residence. LDF parliamentary party leader D R Anil responded that Mayor’s bhavan was never meant as a project to construct a residence for mayor but as a building that integrated various other components. D R Anil also said it was local protests at Kunnukuzhy which had impeded the progress of the project. His remark provoked Kunnukuzhy councillor Mary Pushpam and she said that the LDF was forcing the project on the residents there. “The project site is in SC colony, Barton Hill. About 250 families will be affected. Besides there is a community hall, an anganwadi, a tailoring institute which are linked with the livelihood of the people. Why is it being forced upon them?” she asked. Senior councillors Palayam Rajan and Gopakumar rebuked Mary Pushpam and said that her declared stand to oppose a project at any cost would not be encouraged. “LDF council has been more than humane in its approach so far. You cannot challenge anyone with such open declarations of protest,” said Palayam Rajan. P K Gopakumar went one step further and said that Mary Pushpam was acting under the influence of some people with vested interests and that she was denying the chance of development there. The state government has given sanction to civic bodies to utilize their own fund to take buildings on rent to be used as official residence of the mayor. The government had issued an order based on a letter from Thiruvananthapuram city corporation secretary. As per the order, the maximum permissible rent for the building shall be Rs 15,000 and onetime expense of Rs 1 lakh will be sanctioned for deposit, furnishing and maintenance expense. The furniture and other items being bought for the rented residence shall be treated as the corporation’s assets.

This is a new strategy adopted by colleges, after learning from past experiences. During the days before the pandemic, practical classes were usually conducted after theory classes were over. However, now it is held simultaneously. “When the classes had to be held online during the first wave, we had a tough time, and could not hold the end-term examination, since practical classes were not held. The examination had to be conducted only after physically allowing students to complete their practical classes, which cannot be held online. Learning from our past mistakes, we decided to hold practical classes as soon as the college opened. In case of any closure, online classes can be held for theory subjects. The practical classes are held for science, and some batches of arts students,” said Sister M Venissa, principal, St Agnes College. “It becomes an easy transition in case the college has to switch to online classes, and the examination can be held once physical classes resumes,” said Venissa. “Due to the pandemic situation, we have now asked the faculty to conduct practical classes soon after completion of two theory classes. Conducting practical classes simultaneously saves us a lot of time, and helps to tackle any uncertainties, such as shifting to online classes all of a sudden. We have also conducted all the practical examinations,” said the management of another college. A faculty member of a private college added they have completed practical classes in December last year itself, and classes were completed a few days ago. “During the first lockdown, we had a tough time, and were under a lot of pressure to complete practical classes. The exam cannot be held without it. However, this time we are relieved, since practical classes have been completed at the earliest,” shared the faculty member. More colleges switch to online mode With Covid-19 cases increasing, as a precautionary measure, many colleges have now completely switched to online mode of learning. The latest institution to do so is St Aloysius College, a decision that it took on Thursday. According to the college management, all classes will be held online, and internal assessment examinations scheduled next week too will be held online. Other colleges that have shifted to online mode of learning include NMAMIT, Nitte and AJ Institute of Medical Sciences and Research Centre.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/colleges-conduct-practical-classes-in-advance/articleshow/88883967.cms||Kevin Mendonsa
---||Delhi||Delhi: Over 1,000 meet doctors while staying home||NEW DELHI: Around 1,000 people have benefited till now from the tele and videoconferencing services started by the three corporations through which doctors can be consulted for Covid-19. Doctors have been engaged in 2-3 shifts to resolve the queries of mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic patients. A South Delhi Municipal Corporation official said, “Patients are advised proper treatment according to the protocol. The consultations include psychological counselling, reassurance and proper guidance considering people are scared and anxious because of their experience during the deadly second Covid-19 wave. Serious patients are called to Mata Gujri Hospital, Tilak Nagar for further advice as we have 24x7 emergency services with an ambulance facility there.” While the telecounselling facility was started last year, video counselling was added this time to listen to the issues of patients or their family members face to face. “We only insist on video calling if there is a lack of clarity. Our team members keep all call records and demography of patients for future reference. But their medical history is not recorded and details are not shared with others because the main purpose of telecounselling is to provide online consultation for immediate help,” said the official. East Delhi Municipal Corporation started both video and telecounselling facilities on January 8. Since then, it has been receiving 80-100 calls every day. “Initially, two doctors were getting 15-20 video calls each daily, while the team members were getting 60-70 calls on the phone. Though the number of calls has reduced now, we have made rosters for attending to calls to divide the work pressure,” said a senior doctor from Swami Dayanand Hospital. “The elderly are more worried about comorbidities. Their anxiety can be judged from the fact that some call at least 4-5 times a day after testing Covid-positive or being diagnosed with symptoms of the illness,” added the doctor. A North Delhi Municipal Corporation official said people wanted information about Covid management and treatment, vaccination centres, crematoriums, death certificate, ICU and oxygen bed availability as well as sanitation methods, including lifting of biomedical waste. The Ayush department of the corporation said their priority was to guide people with home remedies to help them recover from post-Covid effects. “People have been asking why they are getting infected despite receiving both vaccine shots. We tell them that it depends on their immunity as well as the Covid-19 variants, so they need to adopt safety measures,” said a senior doctor. Their helpline number is 1800-200-8701.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/over-1k-meet-doctors-while-staying-home/articleshow/88885321.cms||Vibha Sharma

Dharmendra is the adopted son of Surendra Bahadur Singh, Raja of the erstwhile state of Sakti in Janjgir Champa district. The family came into pubic glare recently when the raja announced the ‘crowning ceremony’ of Kunwar Dharmendra Singh, declaring him as the “heir to his throne”. Investigating officer Rupak Sharma told TOI that an FIR has been registered against Dharmendra on the basis of a complaint filed by a family member. “She was alone at home when the incident took place. She was manhandled too,” Sharma said. Dharmendra has been charged under IPC sections 377 (unnatural sex with a woman classified as rape), 354 (assaulting a woman to outrage her modesty) and 450 (house-trespass). Police are taking down statements from the accused, survivor and other family members. The royal family is locked in several disputes, including property. The crowning of Dharmendra is being questioned, and his adoption was challenged in court by queen Rani Geeta. This is the second royal family row in Chhattisgarh in a month after the children of late Devvrat Singh, a legislator, went public at a press conference, alleging harassment by their stepmother, who has denied the charges.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/royal-family-member-booked-for-rape-in-janjgir/articleshow/88886573.cms||---

Sources close to the chief minister’s office told TOI that Jagan and Chiranjeevi discussed more about politics rather than film industry issues during their meeting here on Thursday. Jagan hosted lunch to the film star and officially the meeting was to discuss the controversy over the pricing of cinema tickets in Andhra Pradesh. Sources said Jagan offered a Rajya Sabha ticket to Chiranjeevi during the discussions. Four Rajya Sabha seats to fall vacant this JuneHowever, neither Chiranjeevi nor the CMO has officially confirmed that the two leaders had talked about the Rajya Sabha seat. Four Rajya Sabha seats will fall vacant in Andhra Pradesh in June this year. These vacancies are scheduled to be filled in during March-April. While YSR parliamentary party leader V Vijayasai Reddy, who is retiring, is likely to get another term, the ruling party would win three more seats to be vacated by BJP, given its strength in the state assembly. Besides Vijayasai Reddy, BJP MPs Suresh Prabhu, YS Chowdary and TG Venkatesh are scheduled for retirement on June 21. The three seats from the BJP would be an additional bonus for YSR Congress and the election would take YSR Congress party's strength in the Rajya Sabha from the present six to nine. Sources said Jagan offered a seat for Chiranjeevi. The film actor is said to have accepted the offer. While Jagan took the decision to checkmate Chiranjeevi's brother and Jana Sena president Pawan Kalyan in AP politics ahead of 2024 general election, the film star is interested in coming back to politics. Sources said the chief minister had also browsed the issue of possible by-election to Narasapur Lok Sabha constituency, as its sitting member and rebel MP, Kanumuri Raghurama Krishnam Raju, is planning to quit and seek re-election. Incidentally, Narasapur is the home constituency of Chiranjeevi and he has considerable following there. He contested unsuccessfully from Palakollu Assembly constituency in 2009, when he floated Praja Rajyam Party. He hails from Mogalthuru village of Palakollu Assembly constituency, which is part of Narasapur Lok Sabha constituency. While the chief minister proposed Chiranjeevi's name for the by-election, it is said that the film star is interested in the Rajya Sabha seat. Jagan is said to have finalised the candidature of his close aide, Marri Rajasekhar from Chilakaluripet in Guntur district, for another seat, while keeping his options close on the third candidate. Rajasekhar is said to be the best choice for Jagan to be sent to the Rajya Sabha and become the voice of a strong social group in Guntur district.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/jagan-likely-to-offer-rs-ticket-to-chiranjeevi/articleshow/88886574.cms||Gopi Dara

It was a low-key celebration as a limited number of people were allowed inside gurdwaras. As several people from Punjab reside in the city, Lohri has always been a grand festival here. However, with the rising number of Covid cases in the state and restrictions imposed by the government, organising committees had decided to keep it low this year. Ajay Pal, president of Sikh Samaaj Rajasthan, said they had issued instructions to all gurdwaras to allow a limited number of people inside. "Due to the rising number of cases, people are avoiding religious places, but for Lohri, we have limited it to just a small gathering. Around 7 pm ardas was sung in the gurdwara and then the Lohri pyre was burnt. Committee members were present and we distributed rewari and peanuts as prasad," said Ajay Pal. Hand sanitisers and masks are distributed in the gurdwara and a temperature machine was installed at the entrance. The Raja Park Punjabi Samaaj, which used to organise the biggest Lohri celebration in the city, had also decided to invite just a few committee members.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/curbs-hit-lohri-festivities-limited-crowd-in-gurdwaras/articleshow/88886582.cms||---

Fatehpur remained the coldest logging 2.4°C, the Met said. Attributing the continued dip in mercury to active northerly winds and the vanishing of factors including western disturbances and upper air cyclonic circulation, Jaipur Met office said similar weather conditions will prevail in the next couple of days. People in Jaipur woke up to the coldest morning this year with a minimum temperature of 5.5°C, almost 3 degrees below normal. Also dense fog and mist was seen in the morning that affected normal life especially road traffic. Vehicles carrying milk, vegetables and other essential commodities were moving slowly due to poor visibility. Traffic on highways connecting Jaipur to Agra via Bharatpur, Jaipur to Delhi via Behror, Jaipur to Ajmer via Kishangarh was chaotic due to poor visibility in the morning.  The ongoing spell of cold wave has also affected the footfall of morning walkers in city parks and roads. In the evening, people confined themselves to their homes to avoid the cold wave. In this week so far, a dip of almost 7°C on an average was witnessed in the state. “Last week, majority of the places had its minimum temperatures above 10°C, but in this week so far, the minimum temperatures remained below 10°C,” said an officer with Jaipur Met office.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/state-reels-under-cold-wave-citys-min-temp-dips-to-5-5c/articleshow/88886583.cms||---

Several markets in the Walled City including Kishanpole Bazar, Choti Chauped, Chauda Rasta, MI Road, Ajmeri Gate, wore a deserted look as shopkeepers began closing down shops by 7.30 pm. All major markets wear a deserted look by 8.30 pm. The new norms, which came into effect from Tuesday night, are strictly imposed across the city. “The police mandate so far was confined to disperse crowds by 10.30 pm ahead of the night curfew at 11 pm and to ensure through awareness campaigns that Covid appropriate behaviour was followed. The new curbs, however, make it amply clear that we have to be more stringent in our response to the tide of rising infections,” said a police official, adding that the market associations were notified in advance to cooperate and adhere to the new guidelines. However, shopkeepers who had been hoping for a brisk business ahead of the Makar Sankranti festival were left disappointed. They are now hoping that the daytime sales would compensate for the evening curbs. “The evening footfall in many markets for the past two weeks had been steadily declining due to the harsh winter conditions. People anyway stepped out to shop after 12 pm and returned by 5 pm. But sales could have increased if Covid had not begun to flare up,” said Akshay Agarwal, a shopkeeper in Mansarover. Nand Lal Chordia, a trader who sells grocery items to small shops on the outskirts of Jaipur, said, “There were incessant rains a few weeks ago, followed by a cold wave. Therefore, most of the customers chose to complete their shopping before evening. There is still much fervour for Makar Sakranti, although we have to abide by the new norms.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/deserted-look-on-sankranti-eve/articleshow/88886584.cms||---

The police identified the accused as Sulfi, 42, and his brother Suneer, 39, of Pathamkallu, Ayoob, 43, of Pathamkallu and Shajahan, 56, of Irumba near Aruvikkara. Abdul Malik, 18, an ITI student residing at Azhikode near Nedumangad is the complainant in the case. The four accused had allegedly abducted Malik on Wednesday around 7 am from the poultry shop where he worked part time. They forcibly took him in their car and assaulted him till the car reached Nedumangad town. The accused then abandoned the teenager at the town and fled as they realised that Malik's screams were drawing attention of the people on the road. The police said that Malik's kidnap and assault was a case of mistaken identity. Among the accused, Sulfi and Suneer owned a furniture shop at Azhikode. A few days ago, there was a skirmish at their shop during which their shop was vandalized by a group of men. The assailants also vandalized their makeshift watermelon shop. They suspected that Abdul Malik was involved in the skirmish and hence wanted to take revenge.

During the days before the pandemic, practical classes were usually conducted after theory classes were over. However, now they are held simultaneously. “When the classes had to be held online during the first wave, we had a tough time, and could not hold the end-term examination, since practical classes were not held. The examination had to be conducted only after physically allowing students to complete their practical classes, which cannot be held online. Learning from our past mistakes, we decided to hold practical classes as soon as the college opened. In case of any closure, online classes can be held for theory subjects. The practical classes are held for science, and some batches of arts students,” said Sister M Venissa, principal, St Agnes College. “It becomes an easy transition in case the college has to switch to online classes, and the examination can be held once physical classes resumes,” said Venissa. “Due to the pandemic situation, we have now asked the faculty to conduct practical classes soon after completion of two theory classes. Conducting practical classes simultaneously saves us a lot of time, and helps to tackle any uncertainties, such as shifting to online classes all of a sudden. We have also conducted all the practical examinations,” said the management of another college.A faculty member of a private college added they have completed practical classes in December last year itself, and classes were completed a few days ago. “During the first lockdown, we had a tough time, and were under a lot of pressure to complete practical classes. The exam cannot be held without it. However, this time we are relieved, since practical classes have been completed at the earliest,” shared the faculty member. More colleges switch to online modeWith Covid-19 cases increasing, as a precautionary measure, many colleges have now completely switched to online mode of learning. The latest institution to do so is St Aloysius College, a decision that it took on Thursday. According to the college management, all classes will be held online, and internal assessment examinations scheduled next week too will be held online.

The froum wrote a letter to B C Nagesh, primary education minister, in this regard. Prakash Anchan, head of the forum, stated, “In the coming days, if many children are infected, the government may decide to shut down schools across the state. Instead of shutting down all schools, it should shut down individual schools, or in the region that has the highest number of Covid-19 cases. It is unscientific to shut down all schools and cause inconvenience to students, who are already suffering. Further, shutting down schools will affect the mental health of children.” The forum has also urged that the SSLC examination should be held at the earliest.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/conduct-sslc-exam-at-earliest-says-forum/articleshow/88886607.cms||---

Earlier, for a majority of people along the coast, a career in medicine or engineering was preferred. They had no knowledge or penchant towards the UPSC civil services examination. “However, from the past five years, aspirants for the civil services examination have increased in the coastal districts. However, the number is still small. There is no awareness about the UPSC civil services examination here. There are a lot of coaching institutes here, but none for the UPSC exam. It is not possible to crack the UPSC civil services exam, without the help of good coaching centres,” says Umar U H, chairman, Career Guidance and Information Centre.He added that of late, some colleges like St Aloysius and Alva’s College, Moodbidri, have started coaching classes for the exam. “Awareness should be created, and interest should be kindled in young minds, about the UPSC civil services examinations,when students are in high school, and not after reaching the undergraduate level,” said Umar.UPSC civil services examination aspirant Chethan Misquith shared that the number of aspirants for the exam in the coastal districts is now growing, due to the penetration of internet and online coaching. “Earlier, one had to move to Delhi for coaching, but now we can access the same here. Youngsters from the coastal districts were not interested in appearing for the civil services examination, since they had good careers in engineering and other fields, where they earned handsomely,” says Chethan.Nazeer Ahmed, director of Ace IAS Academy, Mangaluru, says that candidates from the coastal region have good potential to crack the civil services exam. “Some of our candidates from here, have made it till the interview stage. Many candidates from coastal Karnataka have cleared the KAS and other examinations, that are conducted by the government of Karnataka.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/coastal-areas-rise-in-aspirants-for-upsc-civil-services-exam/articleshow/88886608.cms||---

Hindu activists say that the footage and photos of Koragajja, Nemotsava and daiva kolas are being manipulated, to desecrate Hindu Gods on social media. They also appealed to the managements of various temples, daivasthanas and Koragajja shrines to put up banners, banning video recording and photography during festivals. Minister of fisheries, ports and inland transport S Angara has also appealed to the management committees of Hindu shrines to take initiatives in this regard. Angara told TOI that he will communicate the issue with the government too. “This is an issue pertaining to faith. Devotees, who visit shrines, have their own responsibility, when it comes to faith. People should rely on their discretion while taking videos and photographs during festivals. They should not be helping miscreants to defame our gods through manipulating videos and photographs. I will do my best to bring this issue to the notice of the government,” the minister said. VHP Mangaluru divisional secretary Sharan Pumpwell said that based on a call given by the VHP, Bajrang Dal and other Hindu organisations, mass prayers were held at more than 1,000 Hindu shrines in the coastal region on Wednesday, seeking severe punishment for those who desecrate Hindu gods on social media. “Attempts are being made to desecrate Hindu Gods and Goddesses by using morphed pictures and videos on social media. Photography and recording videos should be banned during jathre (festivals) in temples and daivasthanas, so that they are not misused. The management committees of Hindu religious shrines should put up boards banning photography and video recording during festival rituals,” he said. He added that even Muslim community leaders have condemned the recent incident of a groom arriving dressed up as Koragajja, at Salethoor in Vittal recently. He said, “However, those who condemned the incident too have tried to help and support the accused.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/hindu-outfits-want-visual-recording-of-festivals-banned/articleshow/88883982.cms||---

The issue popped up while the deputy mayor presented the agenda to renew the insurance of vehicles owned by the city corporation. UDF parliamentary party leader Padmakumar questioned the agenda and said that one of the vehicles on the list being presented on the agenda was not in use anymore and that P K Raju was presenting a faulty list. P K Raju then challenged Padmakumar to do a site inspection and confirm whether the vehicle was not in use or not. Earlier in 2021, BJP councillors had consistently raised mismatches in the number of vehicles owned by the corporation. They had relied on RTI data to pinpoint contradictions. Both LDF parliamentary party leader D R Anil and P K Raju had failed to furnish proper explanations. They had paid for their ill-preparedness as BJP councillor Karamana Ajith pounced on both their mistakes during a special council meeting held in 2021 on revenue and assets. Ajith openly pointed out serious contradictions in the number of vehicles read out by D R Anil and that was mentioned in the audit report and the administration report. When asked to summarize and furnish a reply, P K Raju stammered his way through the financial statements of previous years, often misreading crores as lakhs, evoking further criticism from the opposition.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/deputy-mayor-in-trouble-over-corps-vehicle-data/articleshow/88884715.cms||TNN

The list includes candidates who have been at the receiving end of police lathis, such as 32-year-old Poonam Pandey, an Asha worker who was allegedly assaulted by cops for leading an agitation to raise honorariums. She has been fielded from Shahjahanpur and is likely to be pitted against eight-time MLA and cabinet minister Suresh Khanna of the BJP, said sources. It also includes former Samajwadi Party-member Ritu Singh, whose saree was allegedly yanked upon by some BJP workers during panchayat polls in Lakhimpur Kheri. She will fight elections from the Mohammadi constituency. "Those who struggled for justice should be a part of politics," Priyanka said, while also announcing that her party will field the mother a rape victim in Unnao rape victim as a candidate. Pandey was part of a protest along with Asha workers during an event attended by chief minister Yogi Adityanath when she had a confrontation with the police. She was beaten by batons. A video of the incident went viral on social media. She told TOI, “I am happy that didi gave me this opportunity. When Congress comes to power, Asha workers and every woman will get respect.” Meanwhile, the incident of "saree yanking" in Pasgawa had brought Ritu Singh into the limelight. A video of the alleged incident had also gone viral on social media. She said, “The condition of women is not good in the state. It’s been six months since the investigation has been on but no action has been taken against the accused. Once Congress comes to power, we will ensure that justice is delivered to every woman suffering.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/congress-1st-polls-list-features-several-women-at-receiving-end-of-lathis/articleshow/88883987.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Experts have called this a rare phenomenon in the Aravalis, which in their words is “one of the least researched ecosystems in the world”. One of the top predators, the Black eagle is a hunter and not a scavenging species found in the hills of Eastern and Western Ghats and the Himalayan foothills. An almost entirely black bird that can grow up to 81cm, this bird of prey has a grey-yellow beak with a black tip and yellow feet. It was first sighted in Delhi in 2012. Since then, the bird was spotted only 5-6 times in the city and neighbouring areas. “It’s a very rare eagle to be seen here. The last time it was seen here was in January 2019 in Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary. The bird was first sighted this season at Sanjay Van in November last year,” said Sohail Madan of Bombay Natural History Society. Experts said this was a good sign for the ecology and a matter of research to conserve the Aravalis. “It’s an important finding. As the Black eagle is a hunter, it means it is getting food and a conducive environment here. It mostly resides in the thick rainforests of the Ghats. It was spotted some 10 years ago in this region. This means the Aravalis are more important than presumed. This is one of the least studied ecosystems in the world,” said KS Gopi Sundar, scientist at Nature Conservation Foundation and co-chair of IUCN, Stork, Ibis and Spoonbill Specialist Groups. “Since the nearest Ghats are hundreds of kilometres away, there is a possibility that either there is a connectivity between them and the Aravalis or the Himalayan foothills. There may be some rich patches in the Aravalis. Recently, some rare birds and butterflies were spotted in the region, which was a call to preserve this ecosystem,” added Sundar. Sambhav Jain and Harshul Thareja, who spotted the eagle, asserted that they had to get the pictures identified. “We spotted one juvenile perched on a Prosopis tree while coming back from Asola on January 4. We spotted one in flight again on January 12. We got the photos identified by experts as we were confusing them with the Greater spotted eagle and Imperial eagle because Black eagles are rare in this region,” said Jain, a Delhi-based birder.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/rare-delight-as-black-eagle-seen-after-three-years/articleshow/88885324.cms||Kushagra Dixit
---||Delhi||Delhi man falls on road after being pushed by thief, run over by car; assailant returns to steal wallet||NEW DELHI: Had it not been for CCTV footage, 27-year-old Rizwan’s death on Monday night would have passed off as an accident. But when police analysed the footage, they realised Rizwan had been deliberately pushed into the street, where he fell and was run over by a car. The cops arrested the driver of the car and on Thursday nabbed the man who pushed Rizwan and later stole his wallet and phone. Sanjay Sain, DCP (Northeast), said, “During investigation, the CCTV footage related to the incident showed a person being pushed and falling on the street. A vehicle rammed into the fallen person. After the vehicle passed, the man who had pushed the deceased took the phone and wallet from the fallen man’s pocket.” Rizwan worked as a welder. Police identified the arrested driver of the Innova car as Vikrant, 27, who runs a milk business. The man who had pushed Rizwan was traced and was identified as Furkan, 31, resident of North Ghonda. On interrogation, Furkan disclosed that he was known to the deceased and on Monday, had got him drunk with the intention to rob his mobile phone. He shoved him down to the street, but hid when he saw a police patrol vehicle approaching. In the meantime, the Innova ran over the fallen man. Sain added, “Furkan returned and took away the mobile phone from the pocket of Rizwan, who was alive at the time. We have recovered that phone.” While police initially registered a case of accidental death, the subsequent lead led to Furkan and robbery and other charges have now been incorporated in the case. Rizwan, his relatives said, was a responsible son who was living with his mother, a cancer patient. “We are six brothers and two sisters. My youngest sister and Rizwan, both of whom are unmarried, live with our mother,” said Taahir, elder brother of the deceased. “Rizwan used to take care of everything in the house. He saved money and arranged the wedding of the other sister. He also wanted to set up a family after marrying off the youngest sister.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/man-falls-on-road-after-being-pushed-by-thief-run-over-by-car-assailant-returns-to-steal-wallet/articleshow/88885334.cms||---

Dakshina Kannada District Truck Owners Association president Sunil D’Souza said that there have been reports about the Shiradi Ghat road being closed for six months, for repair works. At a meeting held on Thursday, we told the DC that a complete closure would hit the transportation sector, that is already going through a crisis because of the lockdown. “We urge the authorities to implement a working model, and permit the one-way movement of vehicles. The only option is to travel via Uttara Kannada and Hubballi, which means travelling an additional 200km to reach Bengaluru,” he said. In a letter to deputy commissioner K V Rajendra, the KCCI said the closure of this route that connects the coast with the capital will cause huge inconvenience to citizens and hinder trade, commerce and industrial activities of this region. KCCI president Shashidhar Pai Maroor quoted media reports about the closure of NH-75 from Donigal to Maranahalli. ‘’The project is expected to be completed in six months. While we appreciate this project, the six months’ time to repair a 10 km stretch is too long. We are of the view that with proper planning, this work can be executed in a much less time,’’ he said. It will be devastating if trade activities are affected, as many have already suffered due to lockdowns. They requested the DC to permit cargo movement on the route, while the repairs are being carried out.DC K V Rajendra said that apprehension that the Shiradi Ghat road may be closed has been raised, but no decision has been taken so far by the administration. ‘’We will have to see and verify the report submitted by NHAI on the issue, and then take a call,’’ he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/closure-of-shiradi-ghat-road-upsets-stakeholders/articleshow/88886617.cms||---

According to the data provided by the state health department, Ahmednagar has vaccinated over 62% of the total 2.38 lakh beneficiaries. Dhule is currently placed at the second spot with vaccination of around 42% of 1.13 lakh eligible children, followed by Nandurbar at over 38% vaccination with 94,000 beneficiaries. Nashik and Jalgaon’s track records are rather unimpressive, with Nashik managing to vaccinate around 30% of 3.43 lakh beneficiaries and Jalgaon managing to vaccinate over 29% of 2.25 lakh beneficiaries.Ahmednagar district collector Rajendra Bhosale told TOI that before the vaccination for the children started, the administration had instructed the health authorities of all the talukas to accord top priority to vaccinate the children. “Even the children are responding well to getting their shots, which has enabled the vaccination of over 50% of the eligible children so far,” added Bhosale.According to the Ahmednagar municipal commissioner Shankar Gore, the civic body had asked the authorities of all schools in Ahmednagar to impress upon the parents to get their children vaccinated. “There are some issues regarding the supply of Covaxin in Ahmednagar or else more children could have been vaccinated by now,” added Gore. “Initially, when the vaccination programme for children started, Dhule was ahead of Ahmednagar. But the pace of the vaccination slowed down due to the low supply of Covaxin,” added the health authorities.Nashik health officials said that the pace of vaccination will further be enhanced once the supply of Covaxin is smooth. “We are making all efforts to vaccinate children with the available doses,” added the officials.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/ahmednagar-ahead-of-other-n-maha-districts-in-vaccination-of-15-18-age-group/articleshow/88886618.cms||---

As a result, some of them who are positive for Covid-19 and have no symptoms are moving around. At the same time, others who are not Covid infected, are still waiting for the test report. “My son tested positive on Saturday and hence my swab sample was taken on Sunday. It is Thursday and I still have not received my Covid report,” said Ramesh Wanjul, resident of Sinnar taluka. The health authorities from Nashik civil hospital admitted that there was an issue with the generation of the report though testing was done on time. Dr Utkarsha Dudhedia, the coordinator for testing, said, “The data entry operators sourced from a private organisation have left their job suddenly and hence the data entry is lagging.” Nashik collector Suraj Mandhare, who reviewed the situation, said he has directed the authorities to take all the measures to put the system in place.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/long-wait-for-reports-due-to-workforce-shortage/articleshow/88886623.cms||---

All these demands were made during the general body meeting of the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) on Thursday.Mayor Satish Kulkarni directed the officials concerned to provide all details about the number of slums and the number of people living there at the earliest.As per environment status report of the civic body, there are a total of 168 slums across the city, including 56 authorized and 112 unauthorized. Chandrakant Khade, a corporator, said in 1997, the general body had given its nod to declare the slum near Garware in Ambad as authorised, but the civic administration has still not acted on this.“The public toilets in this slum near Garware are old and outdated. There are electric poles in the area, but without light bulbs. The NMC is supplying water and recovering tax, but not providing basic facilities there,” he said.NCP group leader Gajanan Shelar said the poor live in the slums and the population of all the slums in the city is around 2 lakh. “At this juncture, it is the responsibility of the civic body to provide better basic facilities like roads, streetlights, water supply, public toilets, among others for these people,” he added. Sudhakar Badgujar also raised a question about a slum in Cidco area where the civic body is recovering property tax from the slum dwellers, but the slum is unauthorized.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/corporators-in-nashik-city-demand-better-facilities-for-slum-dwellers/articleshow/88886624.cms||---

Nashik health department data shows that there were 44 deaths in the 14 days from February 15 last year, when the second wave began. In comparison, there have been 13 deaths in the 14 days since December 28. 2021, when the third wave began.This is despite the fact the positivity rate in the third wave has been significantly higher at 26%, when compared to just 5.5% in the initial days of the second wave. “The trend observed in the state and in the Nashik district, is that the number of patients requiring medical attention is very low. Moreover, those requiring critical care is even lower and, therefoee, the deaths have been fewer. This is possibly because the virus is less virulent and vaccination has helped,” said Dr Ashok Thorat, the Nashik civil surgeon. The data shows that number of cases in the first 14 days of third wave have been 9,153 as against 5,396 cases in the second wave period. There are 112 patients on oxygen support and 37 on ventilators now as against more than 300 patients requiring critical care then.Dr Raj Nagarkar, the vice president of Hospital Owners Association of Nashik, said there is no cause of worry yet and the patients in the private hospitals are mostly needing isolation or those who came for planned surgeries and tested positive, or are concerned about the symptoms.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/fewer-hospitalisations-deaths-now-compared-to-2nd-wave/articleshow/88886625.cms||---

---||Allahabad||HC turns down plea of jailed BSP MP Rai||Prayagraj: The Allahabad high court has dismissed a petition filed by rape accused jailed Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) member of Parliament (MP) Atul Rai, seeking quashing of the first information report (FIR) lodged against him on October 23, 2021 at Lanka police station in Varanasi under the Uttar Pradesh Gangsters and Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act. An MP from Ghosi in UP, Rai is lodged in jail since June 2019. Rai is accused in alleged rape of a 24-year-old woman, who later died after setting herself on fire along with her friend before the Supreme Court. Before setting herself on fire on August 6 last year, the victim had released a video alleging harassment by the police and the aides of the accused. The UP police subsequently booked Rai and a retired police officer for abetment of suicide after the victim and her friend succumbed to their burns. The victim had accused the MP of raping her at his Varanasi residence in 2018. Dismissing the writ petition filed by Rai, a division bench comprising Justice Sunita Agarwal and Justice Sadhna Rani Thakur refused to quash the FIR registered against Rai.The petitioner’s counsel argued that lodging of the FIR under the Gangster Act was nothing but violation of the interim protection granted by the high court, in a 2018 criminal case, staying arrest of the petitioner in other criminal cases.According to the petitioner, earlier he had filed contempt petition against some of the police officers and therefore, the investigating officer was bent upon keeping the petitioner behind bars and the current first information report was an act of revenge on the part of the investigating officer and the FIR was registered when petitioner was inside the jail and could not have been involved in any criminal activity. The court after hearing concerned parties while dismissing the petition in its judgment dated January 7, observed, “As regards the contention of counsel for the petitioner that the petitioner being in jail and his bail application having been refused, he could not have been booked under the Gangster Act. We do not find any substance in the said submission and suffice it to say that the first information report cannot be quashed on this ground.”“We may note that the FIR itself narrates that the gang chart dated October 22, 2021 was approved by the competent authority which contains two recent criminal cases against the petitioner. Apart from this, as brought before us, the trial in four criminal cases under the Gangster Act are going on against the petitioner. For all the aforesaid noted reasons, we do not find any case for quashing of the FIR. The writ petition is dismissed, accordingly.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/hc-turns-down-plea-of-jailed-bsp-mp-rai/articleshow/88886628.cms||---
---||Allahabad||PIL in HC seeks check devotees visiting Magh Mela||Prayagraj: A PIL has been filed before the Allahabad high court, requesting the court to direct the state government to restrict the number of devotees who will take holy dip in the river Ganga during Magh Mela at Prayagraj this year.In the PIL, moved by one Utkarsh Mishra and others, it has been stated that the religious congregations in the past two years were found responsible for spreading the deadly virus all across the country.In this backdrop of the situation, the PIL has sought a direction from the court to limit the participation in Magh Mela, a big religious congregation of the world.The PIL said that only seers of ‘akharas’ should be allowed to take the holy dip on the dates of the Shahi Snan to prevent a huge turnout of devotees, as anticipated on those auspicious dates.It was also requested that RT-PCR tests should be made compulsory for the visiting devotees on arrival.It was further submitted that Kumbh Mela of Haridwar, held during the peak of the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic, resulted in a huge number of infections and thus was voluntarily called off by the seers of various ‘akharas’. The devotees who returned to their native places after visiting the Kumbh at Haridwar were found to be super-spreaders, the plea stated.“Holding of such a largescale event in the wake of Covid-19 third wave is putting the residents of Prayagraj as well as Uttar Pradesh state in unnecessary risk. Besides, the Magh Mela event, which is of great religious importance and all the preparations like setting up of camps, electricity, water and sanitation has already been done, calling off of this religious event is not desirable at this high time,” it was submitted.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/pil-in-hc-seeks-check-devotees-visiting-magh-mela/articleshow/88886629.cms||---

His recent statement has made the fight intense as a number of BJP members, too, are eying party ticket, with Shaila Rani Rawat – who contested on party symbol in 2017 – leading the race. Giving credence to the speculation, Harak on Thursday, said, “Am I from Pakistan or China that I cannot contest from any other seat in Uttarakhand? I am free to contest from any seat. It is up to the party to decide. No one called me an outsider when I got maximum work done in Rudraprayag, Kotdwar or Lansdowne.” Harak claimed he was instrumental in Rudraprayag being made a district. Since Uttarakhand was carved out of Uttar Pradesh on November 9, 2000, Harak contested from Lansdowne in 2002 and 2007. In 2012, he shifted to Rudraprayag and then moved to Kotdwar in 2017. He was successful in winning all four elections. For most part of his political journey, he has held key positions like minister and also leader of opposition. “During the Kedarnath tragedy, I was involved in rescue efforts. I got chopper landed at locations where others could not have dared to. Was I an outsider? All the efforts were made with a selfless motive,” said Harak. On the other hand, Shaila Rani Rawat – who was among the 10 Congress MLAs to leave the party in 2016 – had contested on BJP ticket in 2017 but lost the seat. Despite losing the election, Shaila and her team remained active and once again she is among the frontrunners for party ticket. “We have worked hard here in this constituency for the last five years. People here have faith in me and they want me to contest. If anyone else is given the ticket, I will consult my supporters for further course of action,” she said. In the 2017 elections, Congress nominee Manoj Rawat got 13,096 votes and won the seat by 869 votes. He defeated independent candidate Kuldeep Singh Rawat while BJP nominee Shaila Rani Rawat finished fourth with 11,472 votes.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttarakhand/news/tough-call-for-bjp-as-harak-eyes-kedarnath-seat/articleshow/88888265.cms||Kautilya Singh

---||Hubballi||Major jatras in north Karnataka feel earning pinch amid curbs||HUBBALLI: The jatras of Banashankari, Koppal Gavisiddeshwar, Sharana Mela in Kudalasangam, Vijayapura Siddeshwara and other such performance events in North Karnataka have been cancelled or are being held in a low-key manner, triggering financial distress for those who depended on these events for a year’s earning. Drama companies, theatres, small food suppliers, transport, toys, shamiyana and other related businesses have taken the hit. Chindodi Vijaykumar, the convenor of the Sri KBR Drama Company in Davanagere, told TOI that the Banashankari Jatra is only one in state where 12-13 drama companies stage four shows a day for a month. “Last year, we were allowed to stage plays after the fifth day of Rathotsav. We hope the district administration will permit us this year also. Our life is already miserable after the night and weekend curfews. Currently, we are in Kukanur after the Gudneshwar Jatra. We used to get more audience for night shows but the night curfew has ruined our earnings,” Vijaykumar said. “We are running shows in the afternoon even just for two or three people when we used to stage an extra play on Sundays. That has been stopped now. We are ready to follow all guidelines, like 50% audience, physical distancing, applying sanitiser and wearing masks, if the government permits (performances). Our humble request is to permit as we are already leading a hell-like life from almost two years. Social help towards artistes is also ending as it’s a question of one’s survival. Our morale is down to nil and we are thinking of alternative ways out,” Vijaykumar added. P Veeranna, the president of the Kirani Vartakara Sangh in Badami, said that last year at this time, Covid was on a downward trend but, this year it’s surging. “Hence, lakhs of families, particularly those involved in small businesses such as toy making, oil and coconut, mirchi, bangles and sweets, will be pushed towards a fresh financial crisis. The Banashankari jatra is such a socio-economic event that thousands of families earn for six months in one month. Many of them repay their loans after the jatra. As of now, the government has banned Darshan till January 19, while Rathotsav is scheduled to be held on January 17. We have seen that many invest thousands and get returns in lakhs within a month. It’s the only jatra where one can get all commodities right from household articles to furniture and type of entertainment like drama, cinema, toy-plays etc,” he said. Andappa Kolur, the president of the Karnataka Rajya Rait Sangh in Koppal district, said the current Covid-19 statistics are politically motivated after Mekedatu padayatra. “The Koppal jatra is highest crowd-pulling event in the state and it caters to lakh of families in the Kalyan Karnataka region. If the government cancels it, it will push thousands of people into hunger. When the current variant is weak enough, why is the government playing this game of statistics? Moreover, the jatra is a major market for farmers’ produce. Instead of cancelling it, the government can impose guidelines. Restrictions like curfew, lockdown and cancellation are expected to cause more deaths than Covid-19,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/major-jatras-feel-earning-pinch-amid-curbs/articleshow/88886634.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

The Kali has 92.45% forest cover and four tigers, according to new forest report. This Kali tiger reserve is in the fourth place, following Pakke in Arunachal Pradesh with 96.83% forest cover, Achanakmar in Chhattisgarh with 95.63% and Simlipal in Odisha with 94.17% forest cover. Dampa in Mizoram with 92.05% cover is in the fifth place. However, the assessment between 2011 and 2021 shows that Kali has lost forest cover by 13.14 sqkm. The forest area in 2011 was 1,318.36 sqkm and in the 2021 report it has come down to 1,305.22 sqkm. The total area of the tiger reserve is 1,411.75 sqkm. The forest cover in Bandipur, Bhadra, Nagarahole and B M Hills tiger reserves are 53.53%, 74.45%. 75.43% and 86.21%, respectively. Bhadra has lost forest cover by 53.05 sqkm, while Bandipur has lost 7.39 sqkm. B M Hills has gained forest cover by 16.77 sqkm and Nagarahole has lost 42.38 sqkm. The Kali has 273.74 sqkm of very dense forest, 962.33 sqkm of moderately dense forest and 69.15 sqkm of open forest. It should be noted that the tiger corridor of the Anshi-Dandeli-Sharavathi valley is one of thickest corridors in terms of forest cover. The total forest cover in the corridor is 93.67% across 405.44 sqkm, among the top three among forest corridors across the country. The highest number of tigers in the state are in Nagarahole which has 127 of the big cats, followed by Bandipur at 126. A conservationist said that although the data showed four tigers in Kali in 2018, currently the population has jumped to at least 15. Rahul Bavaji, a conservationist said the decrease in forest cover is unfortunate. He said the forest department must ensure protection of grasslands in the woods which will help the tiger population.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/kali-tiger-reserve-among-top-5-in-forest-cover/articleshow/88886638.cms||Shreyas HS

In Kalaburagi, a divisional headquarters for KK, coverage is 34% and Yadgir is struggling at 29%. The health officials are attributing below par coverage to absenteeism and hesitancy among parents. Although daily, health staff visit the schools, they are unable to speed up the inoculation. Of the total targeted population of 1,59,770 in Kalaburagi, 54,035 teens have got the jabs and in Yadgir 21,360 have been inoculated from the total 73,965 targeted population. Both districts are in the bottom two. According to Prabhuling Mankar, the district immunisation officer, government schools have registered less than 50% attendance every day since the vaccination began. For the unvaccinated children, health department staff must visit their homes to administer the vaccine with the consent from parents. Also, the majority of the kids in the two districts study in government facilities. Prabhuling said that because of the fear of the rapidly spreading Omicron variant, a section of parents have stopped sending their children to school. Also, many children have dropped out of school during the pandemic and have not returned to class. District health officer Sharanabasappa Ganajalkhed told TOI that apart from absenteeism, in some pockets vaccine hesitancy is an issue. In rural pockets, parents are reluctant to consent on vaccines. Health officials are working hard to convince them. This may yield results, he said. Yadgir district health officer Indumathi K Patil said absenteeism is high in schools. “Now, we are changing the strategy by visiting the homes of the children. There are many dropouts and we are making all effort to reach them,” she said. If the schools are shut in the coming days, then vaccination drives will take a severe hit, a health official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/absenteeism-and-hesitancy-cripple-kids-vaccine-drive-in-two-districts/articleshow/88886640.cms||Shreyas HS

Chairing a meeting of district officials and health taskforce here on Tuesday, he said experts have warned of positive cases surging in the next week. The health department should closely monitor medical infrastructure in government and private hospitals and procure required medicines, he said. The administration must take stock of medical liquid oxygen (MLO) available in private and government hospitals and maintain buffer stock. All arrangements should be made to supply uninterrupted MLO to patients admitted in ICU and HDU (high dependency unit), he said. The Technical Advisory Committee has recommended stepping up of Covid-19 testing and accordingly tele-triaging which involves screening patients remotely to determine the patient's condition and the care needed, mobile-triaging, tracing the primary and secondary contacts of the infected and isolating them either in home quarantine or CCCs should be given priority, he said. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/be-prepared-for-3rd-wave-bureaucrat/articleshow/88886641.cms||---

Retail outlets register more business during the weekend than the weekdays, and the restrictions imposed by the government has hit them hard. The government must impose a lockdown or weekend curfew when the situation is particularly dire.

Those found not donning the mask, and not maintaining a safe distance from each other are being fined, while the authorities have given even more thrust to the vaccination drive. Although the spike in the number of fresh cases being reported across the region – while most districts were reporting cases in single digits until a few weeks ago, most of them are registering fresh cases in double digits, while few have started reporting fresh cases in three digits – nearly 95% to 96% of those testing positive for the novel coronavirus are asymptomatic, with only 1-2% of the patients requiring hospitalisation. Dharwad district health officer (DHO) Dr Yashvant Madinkar told TOI, “Dharwad district has been reporting fresh cases in three digits since the past one week, and the active caseload has soared to 804, as on Thursday. However, 96% of those infected are asymptomatic, while the number of those admitted to the hospital is less than 2%. The remaining patients have a very mild fever, and cough.” Superintendent of Karnataka Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS), Hubballi Dr Arunkumar said, “We have already arranged 1,000 beds for Covid patients. We have also ensured that there are enough beds with oxygen and ventilator support. As on Thursday, there are 12 Covid patients at KIMS, of whom two are being supplied oxygen, while one is in the intensive care unit.” Belagavi DHO Dr Shashikanth Muniyal said that the situation was similar in the border district as well. Of the 957 active cases, 95 to 96% were asymptomatic, he said. “Very few patients are suffering from a mild fever, and displaying symptoms similar to those of influenza like illnesses. Patients with co-morbidities are being admitted to hospitals, while asymptomatic patients are isolated at home,” he said. Although 560 beds have been reserved for Covid patients at Bidar Institute of Medical Sciences, very few patients are being treated there since most of the infected individuals were not displaying any symptoms, said Bidar DHO Dr Ratikant Swamy. The only district where the situation is different is Kalaburagi. “Nearly 50% of the patients infected with Covid are displaying symptoms such as mild fever and cough,” said DHO Dr Sharanappa. A team of doctors has been constituted in all districts to pay a visit to the homes of patients who do not need to be hospitalised. “These doctors will monitor the condition of patients, and take the decision to admit them to hospitals should the need arise,” said a source.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/over-90-cases-in-nk-asymptomatic/articleshow/88886645.cms||Basavaraj Kattimani

Since Covid cases are surging on a daily basis and most of the patients are in home isolation, the number of vehicles to lift garbage from their houses is being adjusted as per requirement.“Till Wednesday, we had deployed 25 garbage collecting twin-bin vehicles throughout the city to lift garbage generated from the residences of Covid patients in home isolation. The vehicles are deployed division-wise in such a manner that the garbage can be collected and taken for disposal. Two employees, one driver and one helper, are on one vehicle,” an official said.As per MC records, the civic body authority started collecting garbage from houses of Covid patients with just 10 vehicles over a week back. The figure has reached 25 vehicles. Since Covid cases are on the rise, additional vehicles are being added to the fleet on a daily basis. MC employees going to houses of Covid patients have been given PPE kits, masks and other protective gear.After collecting garbage from the patients’ houses, MC vehicles take the garbage away at a separate point of the dumping ground at Daddumajra. After being sanitised, it is disposed of. “The location of disposal of this garbage from patients’ houses has been kept at a distance from the place where normal garbage is dumped. Our senior officers have been monitoring this exercise,” an official said.However, sources said there are gaps in the exercise and MC employees have not reached a few areas in the city to collect waste from patients’ houses. In some areas, regular garbage collectors collect waste from houses of Covid patients too. “The number of patients under home isolation is increasing alarmingly and we have been covering each house but it is possible that we may get details about houses a bit late,” an official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/dedicated-system-adopted-to-collect-covid-waste-from-houses/articleshow/88886648.cms||Deepak Yadav

Since this is the last GIA of the current financial year, ending in March, it will remain a challenge for the civic body to meet its financial needs, especially when the Central government has turned down its request for additional financial aid for this fiscal. With this fourth and last instalment, the civic body has received the entire amount of Rs 502-crore GIA, which the UT administration had announced for MC last year for the 2021-22 fiscal. The MC has decided to keep the received money for its committed liabilities. It has to spend about Rs 56 crore monthly on committed liabilities, which include salaries and wages, electricity, fuel, water charges, among others. The developmental works will be hit and only the ongoing tasks for which the MC has received dedicated funds will continue. The officers concerned of the MC have started planning to use the money judiciously. “We have briefed the officers and the heads of different departments that we have money only for the committed liabilities and so they need to change their priorities accordingly,” a senior officer said. The MC general house, in February last, had prepared and passed a Rs 1,627-crore budget for the current financial year, but the UT administration gave only Rs 502-crore GIA. However, the amount was Rs 77 crore more than the last financial year’s (2020-2021) budget, when the MC was given Rs 425-crore financial aid.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/fund-crunch-ahead-civic-body-gets-last-instalment-of-125cr-grant-from-admn/articleshow/88886661.cms||Deepak Yadav

Over the years, the dumping yard at Pachanady has been witnessing fire mishaps, causing losses to the city corporation, and inconveniencing the locals. A major fire mishap in April 2021, had caused a huge loss to the tune of Rs 65 lakh, after machinery and a shed were gutted completely. Mayor Premanand Shetty said the civic body has reserved Rs 25 lakh to procure fire-fighting equipment. This apart, water supply network will also be developed at the dumping yard to tackle fires, he said. Various other infrastructure will also be developed at Pachanady. While two more transformers will be installed to increase power supply, a new dry waste collection unit will be developed inside the dumping yard. While Rs 79 lakh has been reserved to upgrade power supply, Rs 86 lakh has been sanctioned to develop a dry waste collection unit. Washrooms will be constructed for the convenience of MCC employees, at an estimated cost of Rs 6.7 lakh, he said. MCC has reserved funds for various development works to be taken up in the city at an estimated cost of Rs 17.4 crore, under the 15th Finance Commission grant.

---||Delhi||Delhi's forest cover lost for first time in a decade||NEW DELHI: For the first time in a decade, the capital has lost forest cover. It may be as little as less than half a square kilometre, but it has happened when most other states and Union territories have shown an increase in overall forest cover. The Forest Survey of India report released on Thursday showed that Delhi has lost 0.44 sq km of forest cover since 2019. According to the India - State of Forest Report 2021, Delhi’s geographical expanse of 1,483 sq km included a forest cover of 195 sq km, just short of 195.44 sq km three years ago. At 13.2% of total geographic area, the forest cover of the capital is less than a national average of 21.7%. Not all is lost, however. The increase in tree cover (outside the forest area) has emerged as a silver lining. According to the report, the tree cover in Delhi went up from 129 sq km in 2019 to 147 sq km in 2021, an all-time high since 2011. Attributing the loss of forest cover to legal felling for development, a forest official said, “Yes, the forest cover has reduced slightly but the quality of forest has improved. The moderately dense forests have increased and open forest systems have thinned slightly. The thinning of the forest cover can be attributed to new infrastructure projects and authorised felling of trees. Compensatory afforestation will take some time to reflect in the results.” TimesViewForests serve as a city’s lungs. Delhi is overwhelmed by pollution and protecting its forests is non-negotiable. Authorities must find ways and means to ensure that the loss of forest cover is not only arrested but more green cover added in the coming years.Delhi government too patted itself on its back at what has been gained. Environment minister Gopal Rai said, “The green cover of Delhi has increased from 21.9% to 23.1% of its geographical area. The state Government aims to plant 33 lakh saplings by March 2022. Under the leadership of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, Delhi has become the first city to have a tree transplantation policy under which trees that are uprooted are transplanted with simultaneous replacement by 10 new trees.” However, amid the reality that forest cover has been lost though tree cover has increased is the concern of some ecologists who don’t feel this is a matter of celebration. According to the experts, Delhi has already lost most of its “true forests” and whatever patches are left are “infested by invasive species”. C R Babu, professor emeritus of Delhi University and head of Centre for Environmental Management of Degraded Ecosystems, said, “Besides the biodiversity parks, Delhi doesn’t have forests. A true forest should have a typical structure, like a top tree cover with canopy-defining trees, medium height trees and scrubs, or ground-based vegetation. Most of such forests have already disappeared from Delhi, barring a few patches, which are infested with foreign vilayati kikar or Prosopis juliflora.” He held land use change and diversion of forests for infrastructure development as the reasons for the city’s shrinking forest cover. “A city must have a good forest cover for environmental sustainability,” said Babu. “More forest cover means less air pollution, better groundwater recharge. Unfortunately, except for the biodiversity parks and the colonised Ridges, Delhi has nothing. Even land here is often diverted for building residential colonies and other infrastructure.” Ecologist and tree expert Pradip Krishen too believed Delhi’s forests are suffering a quality crisis. “The roadside or park trees don’t comprise forests. True afforestation is a big failure because no one cares what is being planted and where. The SFI data too doesn’t discriminate between the quality of trees,” said Krishen. “Over 90% of the Central Ridge is infested with kikar and now even worse, the subabul or Leucaena leucocephala, both good for nothing. We need to discern what our overall green cover is composed of.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/forest-cover-lost-for-1st-time-in-a-decade/articleshow/88885347.cms||Kushagra Dixit

The report by the Forest Survey of India, which is an assessment of the country's forest resources, was released on Thursday.The FSI included the 114-sq km area of Chandigarh without the Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary.UT’s chief conservator of forests (CCF) Debendra Dalai said, “The green cover of UT has increased in 2021. In 2019, the UT’s tree cover was 25 sq km, but in 2021, the FSI bifurcated it in two categories—tree cover and forest cover outside the recorded forest area (RFA). The UT’s tree cover is 15 sq km and forest cover outside RFA is 14 sq km. So, in total UT’s tree cover is 29 sq km, which is more than 2019’s figure of 25 sq km.”The city’s forest cover, which is now 22.88 sq km, was 22.03 sq km in 2019. The report said, “The UT has 1.36 sq km under very dense forest (VDF), 13.51 sq km under moderately dense forest (MDF) and 8.01 sq km under open forest (OF). Forest cover in the UT has increased by 0.85 sq km as compared with the previous assessment reported in ISFR-2019.”The city has witnessed a dip in tree cover, which decreased from 25 sq km in 2019 to 15 sq km in 2021. However, in percentage of tree cover in terms of geographical area, Chandigarh tops in the country. Report said, “Considering the percentage of geographical areas of states and UTs, Chandigarh shows the highest percentage of tree cover (13.16%), followed by Delhi (9.91%), Kerala (7.26%) and Goa (6.59%).”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/citys-green-cover-increases-by-10-31/articleshow/88886671.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

The boy from Parabdi village of Dhoraji taluka was treated at the KT Children Hospital, an extension of PDU government hospital, where he spent as many as 80 days on ventilator support.GBS is a rare neurological disorder in which the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks nerves.Explaining the disease, Dr Pankaj Buch, head of KT Children’s Hospital, said: “In the initial phase the patient suffers from viral infections like cold, cough and fever. The patient’s immune system becomes strong to fight these infections. But as an adverse effect, the immune system later paralyses the patient’s throat and respiratory system. In absence of timely treatment a patient can even die.” “Krish was hospitalized for 102 days out of which he was on ventilator support for 80 days. It’s the first case in which a paediatric patient was kept on a ventilator for so many days. We are happy that he has been cured of the ailment now,” Dr Buch added.Krish first suffered fever and severe headache but later his hands and legs were paralyzed, hospital officials informed. After being treated at a private hospital in Dhoraji, Krish was referred to Rajkot PDU Hospital three months ago. He was later diagnosed with GBS. The treatment involves costly medications, informed Dr Bhumi Changela. “GBS patients are given intravenous immunoglobulin injection each costing Rs 80,000 to block antibodies created in the body,” Changela said. Krish also suffered from pneumonia and dengue during his stay at the hospital, but recovered thanks to the care and treatment provided by the doctors at PDU Hospital. “My son could not have received better treatment anywhere else in the world. The doctors have given new life to my son,” said an elated Divyesh Gajera, Krish’s father.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/after-102-days-in-hospital-10-year-old-boy-from-dhoraji-village-cured-of-gbs/articleshow/88886672.cms||---

---||Rajkot||RMC to control stray cattle menace with radio tagging||Rajkot: Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) will procure 4,000 radio frequency identification tagging (RFID) to tag stray cows and control bovine population on public roads. Tagging is expected to start by the end of this month. RMC’s cattle nuisance control department (CNCD) has already strengthened its drive to catch stray cattle in the past one month following orders from state government and also as directed by the BJP state president R R Paatil to city mayor in his recent visit to Rajkot. According to officials in the civic body, an average of 50 cows are caught every day now, which was earlier at 25. RMC tagged around 8,000 cows in 2016-17, but chances of tampering with those tags are much high. Hence, it becomes difficult to identify the animal even if it is found loitering on the road for the second or third time.Veterinary officer of CNCD department, Dr B R Jaksaniya told TOI, “It will be mandatory for cattle breeders to get animals tagged with RFID if they want to keep the livestock in the city. This tag will tell us the ownership of the animal and we will also come to know that in the past also the same animal was caught violating rules. We will decide more penalties for repeated offenders in order to control cattle menace.” According to officials, any untagged animal caught will not be returned to the owner by merely collecting a penalty. In order to establish ownership, breeders must tag their own cattle. Currently there is a one-time penalty of Rs 1,000 while Rs 700 is charged daily for fodder of the big animals. There is no higher penalty for repeated offenders. RMC has allotted a budget of Rs 8 lakh to buy RFID tags and readers. RFID chips will be inserted under the skin of the cattle containing data of its owner’s name, area, age etc. The officials can read this data using the readers and immediately identify the animal’s history. As per the rules, cattle breeders who don’t have land in the city are not allowed to keep animals and cattle breeders are not allowed to release the animals on the roads.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/rmc-to-control-stray-cattle-menace-with-radio-tagging/articleshow/88886682.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

Recurring such open seditious and genocidal calls in the country are deeply disturbing." Censuring the government of turning a blind eye to the hate speeches against the Muslim community, Abdullah said the criminal hush in government circles raises a question mark that begs to be answered. He said that India being a signatory to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (CPPCG) under Article 3 C which clearly criminalises 'Direct and public incitement to commit genocide' - should act firmly against such groups and individuals that call for 'genocide' of country's Muslims. "These hate speech conclaves also fit a variety of crimes under Indian laws and are antagonistic to national integrity and peace. The prevailing blanket silence of the country's head and absence of any punitive action has emboldened such hate mongers," he said. .

This court can state that they have lost their right or authority to continue in their particular offices in their position. As public servants, they have a duty to discharge to every citizen of the country. They may deny the contentions raised in the petition, but they cannot hide behind a counter filed by the assistant engineer. It only shows that they have scant regard for the dignity of their office.The court was hearing a petition filed by T Muthu of Madurai district. His son M S Manojkumar,13, went out of his house on September 19, 2017, to visit his grandmother since it was raining. When the boy touched an electric pole, he died of electrocution. Claiming that the death was due to negligence of the authorities, the petitioner moved HC Madurai seeking compensation.A TNEB assistant engineer, in his counter, submitted that the boy died as he came in contact with a live electric wire. This would not be a reason to claim negligence on part of the authorities. The judge said that live electricity was being transmitted on the pole by the authorities. Observing that negligence was apparent in this case, the judge directed the authorities to pay a compensation of Rs 5lakh to the petitioner.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/5l-to-kin-of-boy-who-died-of-electrocution/articleshow/88886716.cms||Kaushik Kannan

Students distressed over the pathetic condition of the college have been protesting seeking action. Public works department (PWD) engineers had also deemed the buildings unsafe in December and work is on for relocation at an estimated cost of Rs 50 crores.For years, students of the college had been complaining that the buildings and living conditions in the college and hostels are extremely poor. “We didn’t even have proper toilets or drinking water. There is no safety, no compound wall and no proper roads too. A majority of students are women and it is extremely difficult for them,” said P Thamizhan, a final year student and member of the students’ association. The women’s hostel was abandoned two years ago while the men’s hostel and lecture hall buildings were also declared unsafe by PWD engineers following protests in December. “Even the floor gave away in some parts of the buildings. The lecture hall we had was full of cracks and rain water entered easily. Due to the proximity to the lake bed, water enters the buildings easily. Relocation is the only way forward,” said the student. Since both women’s and men’s hostel buildings are damaged and unsafe, they are forced to stay outside and spend on rent.Meanwhile, the college sent a circular to students stating that offline classes will be held from January 19 in the labs where practical work is done. “Accommodation has been arranged for first and second year women students in Kallar hostels after we approached the Kallar Reclamation Board. Now, classes are also scheduled to be held in the labs which are safer. We are doing our best to make alternate arrangements,” said college principal Dr Karthikeyan. He said that relocation will be done since the damages were mainly due to the buildings being close to the lake. An appropriate location for relocation has also been identified and approval from district administration and revenue department is pending. The cost of relocation is estimated to be Rs 50 crores and funds are awaited. However, students will have to wait at least till 2023 for new buildings to be built and the relocation to be done.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/dilapidated-bldgs-govt-homeo-college-awaits-urgent-relocation/articleshow/88886725.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

However, this Pongal season has brought little joy for farmers and sellers as they could get only fewer customers and forced to sell for lower prices.“Most families don’t go without buying turmeric and koorai poo. However, this time, many customers are not ready to buy at the price we set and bargain. One bunch of koorai poo is sold for ₹10 but many ask for two or three bunches for ₹10. Turmeric too is sold at ₹50-70 for a pair. These prices are only marginally higher but considering the costs of transportation, we cannot lower the price any further,” said N Agniraj, a seller from Alanganallur. In case of chewable sugarcane, prices were almost the same as last year but with free sugarcane being given through PDS, there were not many takers. “It is not like before as people are more wary to spend their money. But still we were able to make some good sales on the eve of Pongal. There have been days before when one sugarcane bundle was sold for up to ₹600. Now, we have to convince customers to buy for the minimal price so that we are not left with losses,” said K Seethalakshmi, a sugarcane seller near Yanaikkal.Residents on the other hand were keen to shop to celebrate Pongal. “The Covid-19 pandemic has affected livelihoods of many and cost of most things have gone up. But still Pongal comes only once in a year and we want to celebrate well,” said L Sridevi, a resident of Simmakkal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/pongal-eve-sales-brisk-but-profits-remain-low/articleshow/88886726.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

Petitioner Premalatha had then asked the people to demand Rs one lakh if anyone attempts to distribute cash for votes.Following the incident, Tirunelveli town police registered a case against her under sections of IPC and Representation of the People Act. After completing the investigation, the police had filed the final report before Tirunelveli judicial magistrate (JM) IV court in 2020. Premalatha filed the present petition seeking to quash the above proceedings.Justice G R Swaminathan observed that the petitioner’s words can never be understood as interfering with the free exercise of any electoral right. She was not casting any undue influence on voters. In fact, the petitioner’s speech must be taken as throwing a challenge on those who indulge in such acts. The judge said that the offences are non-cognizable and hence the inspector of police could not have registered the FIR on his own.The judge said section 123(2) of the Representation of the People Act is not a penal provision at all. That apart, a degree of exaggeration and margin must be permitted in such election speeches. No prudent person will deem it as an offence or cause registration of FIR, the judge said. Observing that the registration of the FIR is bad in law, the court quashed the proceedings against the petitioner.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/hc-quashes-proceedings-against-premalatha/articleshow/88886729.cms||---

In various orders on “expenditure management and rationalisation of expenditure” since the Covid-19 outbreak, different directions were given on any expenditure that was Rs 1 crore and above.  In an office memorandum issued on June 17 last year, the finance department’s budget division directed that all administrative secretaries and heads of departments would have to obtain relaxation from the finance department for incurring expenditure of Rs 1 crore or more. However, it exempted certain expenditures such as salaries and allowances, medical reimbursement, pension of senior citizens and widows, etc. In a partial modification of the June instructions, an office memorandum issued on August 10 stated that it had been decided that the administrative departments were not required to send files to the finance department for relaxation. Instead, they would approve the proposals at their own level and “send a letter on a weekly basis” to the finance department in a tabulated format, it added. The finance department has now decided to withdraw the conditions “with immediate effect”. It stated, “Departments will now incur expenditure as per the delegation of financial powers to them.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/finance-dept-eases-curbs-on-expense-management-imposed-during-2nd-wave/articleshow/88885383.cms||TNN

Located in Sivaisinghpur of Patori sub-division in Samastipur district, the library was officially opened on January 10 by school headmaster Meghan Sahni, who conceptualised the idea during the Covid-19 lockdown in 2020. Sahni, who spent his money and built the airplane-shaped library to arouse kids’ interest in attending school, told this newspaper on Thursday that he adopted the idea because he wanted students to experience the same joy of boarding an airplane while also learning. “In 2018, we painted the classrooms to resemble train coaches and dubbed them ‘Shiksha Express’. The model was well received, and students became more focused on their studies,” he recalled. Asked how he came up with the idea for the airplane-shaped library, the headmaster explained, “Since the majority of the children come from rural areas and have never seen an airplane, I decided to create a room that resembles one. I prepared the front section as a cockpit, added a few buttons, and installed the book shelves. It took nearly three months to complete the civil work.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/aeroplane-like-library-takes-off-smoothly-in-samastipur-school/articleshow/88886731.cms||Faryal Rumi

It was alleged in the FIR that Sihha had been spreading “misinformation” to cause enmity and hatred in society. Jaiswal urged the police to initiate action against Sinha under relevant sections of the IPC and IT Act.“Sinha had described Emperor Ashoka as “ruthless, amorous and lustful” who also killed his brothers,” Jaiswal alleged in the FIR, adding Sinha had also compared Emperor Ashoka with the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb.Emperor Ashoka is remembered for building the Magadhan empire. He also believed in Buddhism and took steps for the spread of Buddhist teachings in Asia. He ruled the empire with compassion. Former Bihar CM Jitan Ram Manjhi also joined the chorus that Asoka the Great was being denigrated because of the “backward” origin of the Maurya dynasty. Manjhi, a Dalit who now heads his own outfit but has spent a major part of his political career under the wings of OBC stalwarts Lalu Prasad and Nitish Kumar, expressed the view in his official Twitter handle.“Asoka is being maligned because he belonged to a backward class. People with a feudal mindset cannot tolerate the rise to power of Dalits, tribals and OBCs,” Manjhi tweeted.The HAM (S) president did not mention by name playwright Daya Prakash Sinha.He, however, left no one in doubt by urging President Ram Nath Kovind to “withdraw the Padma Shri” given to the one who has insulted the legendary ruler.Ashoka was the grandson of Maurya dynasty founder Chandragupta Maurya, who usurped power by overthrowing the discredited but powerful Nanda dynasty.Sinha, a retired bureaucrat, had got the civilian honour last year and has been chosen for the Sahitya Akademi Award this year for a play based on the life of Asoka who is said to have shunned violence after a victorious battle against Kalinga which filled him with remorse for the large-scale bloodshed. Sinha’s nuanced remark drew an angry response from JD(U) too, which has sought withdrawal of the Sahitya Akademi Award which has been announced but not yet handed over to him.

The PIL was filed against the backdrop of a recent hate statement made by suspended BJP functionary Gajendra Jha from Madhubani, who had announced a reward of Rs 11 lakh for anyone who cut off the tongue of former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi for the latter’s controversial remarks against Brahmins. A division bench comprising chief justice Sanjay Karol and justice S Kumar, while hearing the PIL filed by one Shahzada Qumar Khan, appreciated the constitutional principles as outlined by the petitioner’s counsel, Anshul. It was argued on behalf of the petitioner that the trend of vigilantism and intolerance need to be tackled through systematic and organised machinery, which is lacking in police. Referring to the judgment of Supreme Court delivered in Tehseen S Poonawalla case, where verdict was given against mob lynching and cow vigilantism, Anshul contended that the time has come to discern the conflict between the “freedom of speech” and the “freedom to say anything” while invoking the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution. The petitioner’s counsel also highlighted the recommendations for tackling hate speeches made in the 267th report of the Law Commission of India.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/court-takes-serious-note-ofhate-speech-by-netas-in-state/articleshow/88886735.cms||---

The latter is now evading arrest, as an FIR has been lodged against him at the Puraini police station. The MLA has written a letter to Madhepura SP Rajesh Kumar pleading with him to halt any coercive action against Brahmdeo. He has blamed the government and on-duty officials for the lapses in multiple Covid vaccinations administered to the octogenarian. “The octogenarian’s Aadhar number should have been verified by the on-duty officials. This incident has raised numerous questions,” Chandrashekhar wrote. The RJD MLA attributed the issue of multiple vaccinations to the need for further research into how an 84-year-old person could sustain 11 jabs. “The beneficiary has not yet reported any adverse effects or complications,” he added. Mandal has been booked for using different ID cards to receive 11 vaccine shots, and police are conducting raids to apprehend him. He has not turned on his cellphone since police raided his home in Orai village under the Puraini police station area in the district. Dr R K Pappu, a physician, also condemned the police action against the 84-year-old. He emphasised the importance of monitoring antibodies developed in such an elderly man following multiple vaccinations. “He should be detained and investigated,” he said. Mandal had asserted that he was cured of the diseases from which he previously suffered and claimed to be in good health following vaccination. He, however, remained unavailable for comment on his phone.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/rjd-mla-comes-out-in-support-of-multi-vaxxed-man/articleshow/88886742.cms||Deo Narayan Saha

Therefore, without making any comment on the merits of the case, he observed that as there were not sufficient grounds for granting bail, hence the bail application of Suraj was being rejected.According to Sushil Kumar Verma, additional district government counsel, the victim in her statement had stated that she and accused Suraj were Facebook friends. Suraj, a resident of Mahendragarh (Haryana) had met with her for the first time on January 14, 2021 at Kanpur. The next time he visited Kanpur to meet her was on March 11, 2021. On July 13, 2021, he again came and asked her to meet at the Jhakarkatti bus stand early in the morning. She reached there and Suraj took her to Mahendragarh via Delhi.There he lodged her at his maternal uncle’s house and married her in a temple. She stayed there for one month and in this period he established physical relations with her consent.The accused in his bail application claimed that the victim had told him her date of birth was 15.01.2004. She was an adult. Both lived like husband and wife. He had neither forced her nor physically exploited her. The victim herself had stated that she was living as a wife. Therefore, he had not committed any offence. He has been in jail since August 11, 2021, therefore, he should be released on bail, the ADGC informed TOI.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kanpur/bail-plea-of-man-accused-of-abduction-sex-assault-rejected/articleshow/88886746.cms||---

Requesting anonymity, one of the officials claimed that time pressure applied by their political bosses had caused them to make a hash of the job. The political bosses wanted the roads ready before the imposition of the model code of conduct for the Punjab assembly elections, and so had ordered the officials to hurry up.The official claimed they had no option but to deliver those roads in the given time frame. Confirming the action against the contractors, additional commissioner Aaditya Dachalwal said: "We had received complaints about 15 or 16 inferior roads. When we inspected those surfaces, we found that the Ludhiana Improvement Trust had built some of those, while some were a few years old. Seven roads had disintegrated too early, so orders were issued to stop the payment to the contractors concerned and impose a penalty on them. They must reconstruct the roads, if they want payment."About how bad the roads were, Haibowal resident Rishita Sharma said: "The civic authorities built the Jassian Road during extreme cold weather and the entire stretch was washed away in just one spell of rainfall. It is a big wastage of public money. It doesn’t matter who laid those roads. Whether it was the MC or the LIT, the point is that the money for the work came from the taxpayers. If the officials made roads in haste because of political pressure, then action should be taken against the politicians and the officials as well." The roads are major issue for the city residents. Earlier as well, several roads were damaged in the first rainfall after recarpeting, raising questions over the quality of the material being used. The MC allocates its maximum budget to the road works and this time it had to even revise its budget since it had to lay more roads than the previous years. Residents want action taken against the officials as well the politicians who made them compromise on the quality of material and who failed to supervise the construction on the ground.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/first-spell-of-rain-washes-away-new-roads-mc-contractors-face-the-heat/articleshow/88886757.cms||---

Riya, in her letter given to the SP on Wednesday evening, however, did not mention from whom she and her brother have threat to their lives. In the letter, it was said that as the assembly elections are round the corner, she (Riya) will step into politics as the successor of her father. Therefore, a security cover is being required for her and her brother. The SP, meanwhile, has given instructions to the officer concerned that any step should be taken after understanding the family issues and after thorough investigation. Riya, a resident of Bhataura village of Kotwali Bidhuna, had hogged the limelight after a video went viral on the social media on Tuesday wherein she could be seen claiming that her father had been kidnapped. Her statement, however, was dismissed by her father and sitting BJP MLA Vinay Shakya on Wednesday. He had told reporters on Wednesday that his daughter’s allegations were false and baseless and he was safe and sound at his ancestral residence in Shanti colony in Etawah along with his mother and brother. He added that the act by his daughter is just a political gimmick. The police also termed Riya’s allegations to be unsubstantiated. Later on Wednesday evening, Riya through a letter appealed to the SP Abhishek Verma for providing security for herself and her brother Siddhartha. It was also said in the letter that considering her father’s successor, she has stepped into politics. “This creates a stalemate in the family,” she stated in the letter. SP Auraiya said, “Riya has asked for police security cover. Keeping in mind the things said by Riya, I have instructed the circle officer (CO) Bidhuna Mahendra Pratap Singh to look into the matter. A decision on this will be taken only after thorough investigation.” A senior police official privy to the investigations, however, said that the applicant had not mentioned anything in specific like from whom she and her brother have threat to their lives. To recall, Riya Shakya had on Tuesday accused her uncle and grandmother of taking away her father with them and requested the state government to investigate and reunite her father with the family. “My father is not well. We’re working for BJP in the area but our uncle took my father to Lucknow. I request the government to help us in finding the whereabouts of my father,” Riya had stated. She also said in the video that her father had suffered a brain stroke on May 1, 2018, after which he was admitted to the SGPGI in Lucknow. His father cannot speak clearly and after the operation, his thinking power has also reduced.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/bjp-mla-vinay-shakyas-daughter-seeks-police-cover/articleshow/88892526.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

According to sources, the state-of-the art centre has a capacity to slaughter 16000 birds in one shift, but as of now, only 600 to 700 birds are being culled daily. The MC had conducted raids at a few shops two months back, but now it has been stopped as officials claimed that there is lack of staff and official vehicles. The officials also added that due to the upcoming assembly elections, raids have been postponed as of now. It is to be noted that demand for meat increases during the winter season, but despite that, there has been very less activity at the slaughter house.The slaughter house was inaugurated in February after a long wait of almost one-year, and five model shops were also constructed where people can buy meat slaughtered in a hygienic manner. Five air conditioned vehicles were also provided for transporting the meat to various shops. However, many shopkeepers continue to procure meat from illegal sources so as to evade charges to be paid at the modern abbatoir.One senior MC officials claimed that they are waiting for directions from senior officials to conduct raids. “As soon as we get the approval, we will go ahead with the process,” he said. There is also very average response to the model meat shops located at Hambran Road, Jamalpur, Gill Road and near Railway station. The company representatives who are running the slaughter house as well as these shops claimed that without enforcement, it is not possible to implement things properly. Earlier, the response had increased when raids were conducted but now, things are back to square one.The MC was supposed to install one rendering plant for the disposal of waste created after chopping of meat, but it is still not installed. As of now, the company running the plant is transporting the waste to its plant in Karnal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/slaughterhouse-loses-edge/articleshow/88886760.cms||---
---||Ludhiana||Cong used farmers, SAD turned its pawn: Former Akali member||Ludhiana: Former Youth Akali Dad member Gurdeep Gosha, who has joined the BJP, claims to have done so after seven months of observing how farmer unionists "misguided the masses for their now-exposed selfish motives" and how the Shiromani Akali Dal "chose to save its skin instead of working as a bridge between the central government and the people of Punjab".Addressing a press conference with Bharatiya Janata Party district president Pushpinder Singhal on Wednesday at the BJP office near Clock Tower, Gosha also accused the Congress of "dividing the state’s people". About the farmers’ agitation, Gosha said: "I observed it for seven months and came to the conclusion that the Congress used the farmers to settle scores with the BJP and even the Shiromani Akali Dal became a pawn in this game."Claiming that the Congress hadn’t stropped mere Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s convoy but the progress he would have brought to the state in the form of an economic package, Gosha said his social media outburst after the scuttled visit was an expression of his pain. He said: "Punjab should have acknowledged the PM’s decision to move Children’s Day to December 26 to honour the sacrifice of Guru Gobind Singh’s sons but even that was criticised. I quit the SAD not to contest any election but to serve Punjab. Moreover, it’s better to leave a party that doesn’t give you any respect."Gosha refused to comment about the case against former Akali minister Bikram Singh Majithia and his alleged connections with drug networks. About the farmers’ protest and its aftermath, he said: "The situation would not have deteriorated had the central government been given a clear picture. The Congress, however, used the opportunity to create hatred between Sikhs and Hindus. Some of the farmer unionists had a hidden agenda of gaining power, plans that are now exposed."Speaking about all the deaths during the farmers’ protest, Gosha said: "If the farmer unions had made proper camping arrangements, these deaths could have been avoided." Asked if the party had a leadership crisis in Punjab, BJP district president Pushpinder Singhal said: "It isn’t that we are short of leaders but if people want to join us, we can’t deny them. Many of the ruling party MLAs, former MPs, and senior members want to join the BJP. In the coming days, the picture will become clear."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/cong-used-farmers-sad-turned-its-pawn-former-akali-member/articleshow/88886761.cms||---

Besides huge spike in cases, there has been a spurt in number of serious patients, including those on a ventilator support, in hospitals across the district.As of now, Ludhiana has the highest number of patients in intensive care units (ICUs) among all districts in Punjab. According to data till Tuesday evening, there were 34 patients in ICUs (without ventilator) in the district against just two such cases on January 2. Jalandhar is second on the list with 24 patients in ICUs. In 16 out of 23 districts, there were no patients in ICU (with ventilator) as per the report. The report also revealed that Ludhiana’s serious patients constitute 37.4% of the total such cases (91) in ICUs (without ventilator) in Punjab. Currently, there are three patients in ICUs with ventilator support in Ludhiana. No patient required ventilator support on January 2. Ludhiana has second highest patients on ventilators after Amritsar, which has seven such patients. Bathinda shares the second spot with Ludhiana. As many as 20 districts didn’t have any such patient on ventilator support. The total number of patients in Punjab in ICU (ventilator support) stood at 13. The data also revealed that Ludhiana has 70 patients on oxygen support, against seven patients on January 2. In this category, Ludhiana is second after Jalandhar (101). Patiala is third on the list with 23 petients requiring oxygen support. The state has 247 patients on oxygen support. Epidemiologist in the health department Dr Prabhleen said that if a patient is admitted in the ICU, it does not necessarily mean that each one of them will need ventilator support. She added that patients who need oxygen support are those whose saturation level is down, and when saturation decreases beyond a certain level, then patients may develop other complications. She said there is no indication that it is Omicron which is causing a surge in cases and it can be a Delta variant as well behind the spike.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/icu-admissions-ludhiana-worst-affected-in-punjab/articleshow/88886763.cms||Shariq Majeed

But despite receiving the orders, various representations as well as peaceful protest by various NGOs, the MC as well as LIT continued with their act of damaging the environment by covering bases of trees with interlocking tiles in Ludhiana. Accordingly, one execution application was filed with the NGT which was forwarded to district courts for execution of orders. Kuldeep Singh Khaira, another RTI activist, said the officials concerned of all three departments were earlier told to appear in person on January 7 and submit a status report regarding compliance of orders of NGT. However, none of them appeared on that date. The court in its orders mentioned that no officials/officers of MCL, LIT and GLADA have appeared as directed earlier. In view of the directions of NGT, New Delhi, it is quite evident that respondents are blatantly violating the directions of NGT. Hence in order to ensure meticulous compliance of order of NGT, the municipal commissioner Ludhiana, chairman of the Ludhiana Improvement Trust and the chief administrator, GLADA, have been directed to appear in person on February 1, failing which the court shall be forced to adopt coercive methods to ensure their presence. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/court-summons-mc-lit-chiefs-for-defying-ngt-directions/articleshow/88886769.cms||---

Ludhiana police officials cite load of VVIP duties as the reason for not starting the challan drive yet. For the past few days, the district on an average has reported more than 500 Covid-19 cases daily. The people are also losing their lives due to the viurs. The Punjab government has already imposed night curfew and directed to ensure Covid norms. Following the imposition of curbs, the entry of the people without masks has been restricted at public offices, but in markets the a large number of people still don’t bother to wear masks. An official of Ludhiana police said, “The VIP and VVIP duties are the reason that we don’t have enough force to start the challans. At least 17 officials of Ludhiana police were deployed for the visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Thereafter, the cops were deployed on duty at CM’s rally outside Ludhiana. At present, some of the cops are deployed on Maghi duty. Maintaining law and order situation is the priority as elections are coming up. Therefore, the challan drive could not be started yet.” Additional deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Sandeep Sharma said, “I am on duty outside Ludhiana and will return by January 15.

---||Pune||Maharashtra govt eyes hospital samples to determine Omicron severity||PUNE: Maharashtra will now focus more on genomic sequencing of Covid-positive samples being sent from hospitals. So far, surveillance was more on samples collected from international travellers, but health officials said an eye on hospital samples will help determine if Omicron has the potential to hospitalise people or cause serious illness. State surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate said samples of mild, moderate and serious patients, who are hospitalised, are being collected as part of this changed strategy. He said that since sample collections started a few days ago, the Omicron variant has not been seen in hospitalised cases as Delta was still involved in critical cases. Daily Covid cases rose to 9,645 in the Pune Metropolitan Region on Thursday, up from Wednesday’s 8,342. At the same time, 3,528 patients were discharged from hospitals after recovery in the last 24 hours. Mumbai (13,702) saw a nearly 17% drop in daily cases while the state’s count dropped marginally, from 46,723 to 46,406 cases. However, deaths in the state saw a surge for the third consecutive day—36. Hosp samples will determine variant impactAnother health official said the thrust of the new sequencing strategy is to find out if hospitalised patients with severe Covid have Omicron or not. "With a slow and steady rise in hospitalisations being noticed across the country, the objective of sending these samples will help calculate the severity index of the fast-spreading variant," the official said. The head of CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, Dr Anurag Agarwal, said he agrees with the state's plan to send samples from those admitted in hospitals. "It will definitely help confirm the degree to which Omicron is leading to severe disease and deaths," he said. Dr Agarwal said currently Omicron is dominant in fast-rising outbreaks and even if it is less likely to be severe, health systems have to be shored up. "Genetic sequencing has shown clear community transmission of Omicron in major cities," he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/state-eyes-hosp-samples-to-determine-omicron-severity/articleshow/88886772.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Sources said that 41-year-old Sohail’s landing in Pakistan is a major blow to the Indian government’s efforts in bringing him to India. Sohail is the son of Dawood’s late brother Noora who died in 2010 due to kidney failure in Pakistan. In October 2018, the US authorities had alerted the Indian government that Sohail, an Indian national (his passport has been issued from Mumbai), has completed his jail term in the US and was a free bird. Police said that a person arrested in any country for any crime, after completion of his punishment, is deported to his country of origin. India was trying to extradite him through the mutual legal assistance treaty between India and the US. The security agencies recently learnt from intelligence sources that Sohail has reached Pakistan. Sohail Kaskar was arrested along with three others in 2014 by the US Drug Enforcement Administration for conspiring to commit narco-terrorism, provide material support to a foreign terrorist organisation. The trio was arrested in Spain in June 2014 on the request of the US government. After their extradition to the US, they were taken into custody by the DEA’s New York Organised Crime Drug Enforcement Strike Force. A police source said, “Sohail is currently in Pakistan. India had tried to get him to the country, but he managed to escape. Dawood has reportedly taken shelter in Pakistan and is used by the ISI (Pakistan’s intelligence agency) for pursuing its anti-India agenda. The presence of Dawood in Pakistan and the protection he enjoys is believed to be the reason why Sohail chose to escape to that country, an officer said. Dawood used to shuttle between Karachi and Dubai. But his options shrank after the US designated him a global terrorist because of the D Company emerging as an important cog in the global narco-terror enterprise.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/likely-to-be-deported-to-india-dawood-kin-flees-to-pakistan-from-us/articleshow/88886590.cms||---

The state’s positivity rate is at 21.4%, but there is no need to panic. Of the 2.25 lakh active patients in the state, 86% are in home quarantine. Among those in hospital care, only 2.8% are serious patients,” he said. According to the cabinet note prepared by the health department, less than 1% Covid patients were in ICU, 0.32% on ventilator support, 0.59% on oxygen and 1.89% patients needed just oxygen beds. Tope said the case fatality rate (CFR) in the state was steady and decreasing. “The CFR was 1.61% in September, 1.78% in October, 1.73% in November and it dipped to 0.5% in December. In January till now, it was 0.03%,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/14-patients-in-hospitals-no-flattening-of-curve-tope/articleshow/88886773.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Upscale localities in Aundh-Baner, Kharadi-Ahmednagar Road-Wadgaonsheri, Hadapsar-Mundhwa, Kothrud-Bavdhan, Wanowrie, Erandwane, Deccan Gymkhana-Model Colony, Magarpatta city, Mohammadwadi-Kausarbaug, Pashan-Balewadi are reporting maximum new cases, the analysis showed. PMC recorded 25,862 cases of Covid-19 between December 1, 2021, and January 11, 2022. “Of these, about 60% positive cases were reported from the city’s upmarket localities. The trend is seen across the 15 wards of the PMC. Slum and low-income localities are comparatively less affected,” said Dr Sanjeev Wavre, PMC’s nodal officer for Covid-19. Since a majority of the residents living in these upmarket areas are educated, they are more inclined to get themselves tested. “Besides, these are also the areas where a sizeable number of private laboratories offering Covid tests are concentrated,” Dr Wavre said. Slum and lower-medium income localities across the 15 PMC wards, including Bhavani Peth, Kasba-Vishrambaug, and other areas like Yevalewadi and Yerawada, are comparatively reporting less number of Covid cases. “Even if you take Wanowrie-Ramtekdi ward, the Wanowrie areas, which has a slew of posh localities, are reporting more Covid positive cases than the Ramtekdi area that mainly has low-income population,” Dr Wavre said. Similarly, Dhole Patil Road ward includes Tadiwala Road and Koregaon Park. More cases are being reported from Koregaon Park than Tadiwala Road, which has a lot of slum and low-income population. Asked whether the skewed testing is responsible for comparatively fewer Covid cases in lower-income areas, Dr Wavre said, “That is not true. This is because a sizeable number of PMC’s Covid testing units are located in low-income areas where Covid testing is free,” Dr Wavre said. Commenting on the trend, senior epidemiologist Amitav Banerjee said, “ Most people living in slums and other densely populated areas have had Covid in the past. Besides, most of them are doubly vaccinated. This hybrid immunity (natural infection followed by vaccination) is likely to be protecting them from the current widespread infection.” On Thursday, PMC tested 19,868 residents for Covid. This included tests carried out at PMC-run testing centres as well as private laboratories. Of them, as many as 5,571 people tested positive for Covid.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/upmarket-areas-reporting-most-cases-pmc-analysis/articleshow/88886774.cms||Umesh Isalkar

SB Patil, joint commissioner, FDA, Pune division, said the records maintained by chemists will contain a person’s name, address, contact number and the details of the kit purchased. “They will be checked by drug inspectors and also will be furnished when demanded by local medical officers,” Patil told TOI on Thursday. The circular was issued a day after state health minister Rajesh Tope and additional chief secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas pointed out that many of those who have tested positive via the self-testing kits had not uploaded the results on the Indian Council of Medical Research's (ICMR) portal. The FDA circular read: “It has been observed that many symptomatic people are buying Covid test kits from medical stores. However, they are not uploading the same to authorities fearing hospitalisation by the government. So to stop such practice, FDA Pune through this circular mandates the chemist to maintain the record of such buyers.” Anil Belkar, secretary of the Pune drug and chemists association, said they have received the circular. But he added that even if records are maintained, it’s up to individuals to upload the data. Director of Mylab, Hasmukh Raval, said the demand for test kits has increased manyfold since December. He too said it’s up to people to ensure positive results are uploaded on the ICMR portal so that they're adequately monitored by local health authorities. On Wednesday, Dr Vyas in a letter asked all district officials to monitor sales of Covid self-testing kits. “It is expected that all Covid-19 positive tests conducted through rapid antigen test kits or home test kits are reported to the authorities. But it seems that there is a large number of coronavirus positive cases diagnosed through these kits that have not been reported to the authorities concerned and such persons appear to be in home isolation,” the letter stated.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/chemists-told-to-keep-records-of-people-buying-self-test-kits/articleshow/88886777.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The highest response was in Mumbai. Over 57,000 beneficiaries, including healthcare and frontline workers, and senior citizens (above 60 years age), took the precaution dose in the state capital. Pune (around 27,000 doses) and Thane (around 21,000 doses) followed Mumbai. The state immunisation officer, Sachin Desai, said no AEFI (adverse event following immunisation) case had been registered across Maharashtra pertaining to the precaution dose so far. Experts claimed that the nine-month rider for the precaution dose after the second shot of Covid vaccine was affecting the response to the new programme. Sachin Patil, chairman, IMA’s Hospital Board of India, Pune chapter, said it had resulted in less footfall in the drive. Maharashtra government has been struggling to increase its speed of vaccination and has taken several steps to bring it on par with the national average but many districts still continue to be on the bottom of the ladder.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/over-2l-precaution-doses-administered-across-state/articleshow/88886778.cms||---

---||Pune||Demand to reopen amusement parks in letter to Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray||PUNE: The Indian Association of Amusement Parks and Industries has written to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, demanding reopening of entertainment parks with 50% capacity in the state. The association said that since the state government has allowed indoor venues like malls, gyms, saloons etc to operate at 50% capacity, it too should be allowed to reopen outdoor entertainment parks and operate at 50% capacity. The letter further said that Maharashtra has over 37 large and small entertainment parks, generating, on average, 13,000 direct and 52,000 indirect employment, which has been affected due to the closure. “Amusement Parks were allowed to reopen from October 22 (last year) after the 2nd wave, and within two months of their reopening they have been closed down once again. This is going to be very fatal for our industry as huge investments and manpower planning were undertaken by the industry to restart its facility,” said the letter. The letter further stated that the crowd at amusement parks is ‘regulated’ due to high pricing and online booking, unlike other tourist spots. Dhimant Bakshi, CEO, Imagicaa, said, “The government must allow the reopening of amusement parks with limited capacity immediately because these are also places where the entire family comes to destress themselves, which in turn eases pressure on city-based establishments like malls and cinemas.” Jai Malpani, director, Malpani group, said, “We run four amusement parks in the state and employ around 8000 people. Since the closedown order, the industry has been incurring tremendous loss. There is no support from the government at any stage for this industry.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/demand-to-reopen-amusement-parks-in-letter-to-chief-minister/articleshow/88886785.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Pune||Pune civic body gears up to free roads of dumped vehicles||PUNE: The civic body has swung into action to remove vehicles abandoned on roads across the city. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has since the beginning of 2022 put up notices on 677 such vehicles and confiscated 104 vehicles. “We will seek details related to the owners from the Regional Transport Office (RTO). The owners responding to the notices will be given a chance either to claim their vehicles or ensure their scientific disposal. However, the vehicles without any claimant will be scrapped,” said said Madhav Jagtap, head of the PMC’s anti encroachment department. A PMC official said notices valid for eight days are issued in the names of the owners to discard the vehicles. PMC records revealed that Nagar road and its surrounding areas had the maximum number of such abandoned vehicles, followed by localities along and off Satara Road. The civic body had identified the spots in areas under its limits to dump these four and three-wheelers and other abandoned vehicles. Empty space is also available at the civic godown, which will be used for keeping the confiscated vehicles. Data available with the PMC and the traffic department revealed that 690 vehicles were towed in the first phase of a special drive against abandoned vehicles in 2018. Over 450 vehicles were confiscated in the second phase of the drive in 2019. The drive could not gather pace in 2020 due to the pandemic. The drive was resumed in August 2021, but was suspended after the Covid cases increased. The dumped vehicles were kept at a space near the riverbed in Deccan. The issue of safety related to the dumped vehicles came to the fore when a four-wheeler caught fire. The PMC had shifted the vehicles from the areas adjacent to the riverbed to prevent any damage to them if water was discharged from the dam into the river during monsoon. The PMC had spent Rs16 lakh to shift the dumped vehicles from riverbed to Balewadi. Prior to that, around Rs 50 lakh were spent on lifting these vehicles from different locations and dumping them in the Deccan area. A senior PMC official said the administration was in touch with the police for getting the information about vehicles. He said, “Some of these vehicles might have been used in criminal activities. If any such vehicle is found, it will be handed to the police asproof.” The official said the vehicles would be scrapped in accordance with the Centre’s new policy announced in February 2021. Around 13 lakh private and public vehicles that are over 15 years old are registered with the Pune RTO.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/civic-body-gears-up-to-free-roads-of-dumped-vehicles/articleshow/88886786.cms||---

Senior inspector Mahendra Jagtap of the Kothrud police station said, “Police personnel and child counsellors spoke to the boys in detail after their father approached us with his complaint.”“Two boys told police that the garage owner had committed the crime on them once in the past two months. The third boy told police that the suspect had committed the crime on him on three to four occasions,” said Jagtap.“The man did not target all the three boys at one time. He used to promise sweets to one boy at a time and take him to an isolated spot in a guava grove located near the garage. He used to commit the crime there. He committed the crime between November 2021 and the first week of January this year. The incidents came to light after the child, who was repeatedly targeted by the man, spoke with his father,” the officer said.Jagtap said the boys’ parents were engaged in some small-time work. “Their father knew the garage owner. He would often drop the boys at the garage requesting the owner to look after them,” he said. Police were awaiting the three boys’ medical reports.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/48-yr-old-held-on-charge-of-sodomising-3-minor-boys/articleshow/88886787.cms||---

---||Pune||Five DEd colleges to close in January, over 350 since 2018||Pune: Unemployment and a freeze on recruitment has led to five teacher training colleges offering diploma and bachelor courses in education in the state to shut down due to lack of enrolment. The number of colleges in the state offering these courses was over 1,000 till five years ago. However, over a period, the number has reduced to 600. The colleges that shut down could not find takers.Diploma in Elementary Education (D.El.Ed) is a two-year full-time course. Admissions are done at state level through a centralised admission process. A high 70% seats of the government quota are filled up by the candidates passing from the respective regional state board of secondary and higher secondary examination, as per merit and the balance 30% seats are filled up by the candidates passing from other regional boards, as per merit.Deputy director of education, Meena Shendkar said, “In Pune district, the Urdu government teacher training college will be shut down. The college has had very poor enrolment for the last five to six years and the expenses are not met. It is a government-aided college but candidates are turning their backs to it and hence it was decided to shut it down.”Sharada Marathe, principal of a teacher training institute, said, “Since 2012, the recruitment process has been halted in government schools and junior colleges. The candidates want to get employed as soon as they complete the course. Then, there is an additional criteria of passing the TET exam which has further decreased the chances of enrolment.”Vinod Talekar, another senior principal of a teacher training institute in Navi Mumbai, said, “We have written to the education department to revamp the course with some new additions based on the ongoing changes in teacher training techniques. The online education element needs to be incorporated in the syllabus on a larger scale. There are some topics that are redundant and need to be eliminated from the syllabus. The colleges will survive only if the syllabus is made employment ready for the candidates. If not government institutes, candidates can find jobs in private schools as well if these changes are made.”Educators said more primary teachers would be needed to overcome the learning losses that stem from online classes.Some young students aspiring to become primary teachers said they had to correct their options and pick other courses leading to better careers because there is too much uncertainty about government jobs as teachers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/five-ded-colleges-to-close-in-january-over-350-since-2018/articleshow/88886790.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
