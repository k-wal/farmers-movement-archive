RPF DG Arun Kumar has also said the railways was providing free internet to passengers and steps should be taken in coordination with service providers to ensure that porn sites are not accessible through this service. The letter issued on March said that major complaints from women pertain to molestation, eve teasing, harassment and unauthorised entry of male passengers in ladies coaches. “In suburban railway networks like Mumbai, women passengers are victims of shoving, objectionable touching, groping and bullying. In addition, women passengers become victims of chain snatching, mobile snatching, handbag lifting and other instances of thefts of passenger luggage,” the letter said. The RPF chief has said that of the 23 million passengers who travel in trains across the railway network everyday, about 4.6 million are women passengers. Kumar has directed the RPF personnel to coordinate with the State Railway Police and create a database of criminals involved in crimes against women and to come up with a short and long term security strategy to ensure safety of women passengers on railway premises. The RPF DG has also said that the railway security personnel could use the National Database on Sexual Offenders for stepping up vigil of criminals and that the position of women’s coaches should be fixed at the platform and CCTV cameras to be specially positioned on platforms so as to provide adequate coverage of these coaches.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rpf-chief-writes-to-all-railway-zones-to-curb-surge-in-crimes-against-women/articleshow/81593929.cms||Dipak K Dash

It all started in 1996-97 when the All India Football Federation (AIFF) introduced the league system for the first time. Churchill led from the start and were overwhelming favourites for the title. Star-studded JCT that had India internationals IM Vijayan, Bhaichung Bhutia, Jo Paul Ancheri, Carlton Chapman and Tejinder Kumar were nine points behind after 10 matches. Then, in the final month, Churchill hit an unexpected bump. They lost against JCT (0-1) and drew the last two games, picking up just two points from a possible nine in the decisive games. They lost the historic title to JCT by one point. Churchill have finished runners-up on five other occasions, including once losing the ‘final’ game against Mohun Bagan at home when a draw was enough. There has been of heartburn in the past, and if they don’t get their act right for the next two matches in this edition of I-League, the hurt will be even more. This time, Churchill remained unbeaten for 11 matches, including the entire first phase. But just when they enjoyed a six-point lead over their rivals, two losses in a row have now pushed them to the second spot and thrown the title race wide open with four teams in contention. On Sunday, Churchill face leaders TRAU – tied on points – with the winner, almost certainly, walking away with the title. “We have made mistakes that have cost us dearly,” Churchill coach Fernando Varela told TOI on Friday. “We have to consider that we didn’t have Hamza (Kheir) and (Joseph) Clemente in defence. They are very important players. We are working on all aspects. The psychological aspect is important to make the players understand how special it is for the fans, the club, the state and for the family of each one of us to win this title.” It would be truly special for Tiddim Road Athletic Union (TRAU) FC, too. Nobody gave the Manipur side a chance when the I-League kicked off. True, Komron Tursonov, their Tajikistan striker, made heads turn by scoring the fastest goal – a mere nine seconds into their campaign – but his side won just one of their first six matches. Then, as Bidyashagar Singh struck form with 11 goals in his kitty, TRAU have been unstoppable. For proof just look at their last five matches – W, W, W, W, W. And they’ve scored 16 goals during this winning run. “Our team’s (first) objective was to be in the top six. Unexpected results (from the team) are surprising. All credit to the hardworking and disciplined players,” said coach Nandakumar Singh. TRAU can take a massive step towards the title if they can put it across Churchill on Sunday. Even if they draw, their better head-to-head record against the former champions, will provide them with an edge in the final round. “Every team in the second phase are all good. They have the capability of defeating any opponent. We won the last five matches, but cannot predict future results. We are happy to be in the title race,” said the TRAU coach. Besides Churchill, TRAU’s calculations can be upset by Gokulam Kerala FC, who have ambitions of their own. Gokulam Kerala were the last team to defeat TRAU – before their five-match winning run – and they were also the first team to upset Churchill this season. With just two points separating them and the two teams above, they would fancy their chances in the last two rounds. “I don’t want to speak about the title (at the moment), but I only know that if God is with us, and if we win against Mohammedan (Sporting), we have a really good chance,” said coach Vincenzo Annese. Curiously, Mohammedan have mathematical chance too. Mohammedan are five points behind, but if results go their way, and they pick up six points from their remaining two matches, the league title could be theirs for the first time in their rich history.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/i-league-title-race-goes-down-to-the-wire-again/articleshow/81594345.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

Active cases had risen to nearly 2.9 lakh on Friday, having surged by more than 54,000 in the past three days. Over 19,000 active cases were added to India's count on Thursday, the highest single-day rise since September 10, when the pandemic was at its peak with over 90,000 daily cases being recorded. Active cases rose in 29 of the 36 states/UTs on Thursday. A high count of active cases not just indicates a wider spread of the infection, but also increases the probability of a higher number of deaths in coming days. The day’s death toll from the virus rose to 188, the highest since January 14. Although daily deaths have been on the rise, the case fatality rate continues to be low due to a much higher spurt in cases. India reported 40,944 new cases on Friday, up from 39,703 recorded on the previous day. The seven-day rolling average of daily cases crossed 30,000, rising from 29,350 on Thursday to 31,647, a growth of 7.8%. The seven-day average has risen by more than 5% for an unprecedented six days in a row, making this the sharpest rise in cases since the pandemic began.

---||Bengaluru||Indian Ensemble's first show post pandemic combines fiction and reality||When the country was getting affected by the pandemic's long lull, writer and director duo Saudamini Kalra and Tushar Mathew spent that time observing the sudden change and its effect on the environment, turning the negativity around the lockdown to a positive event. "Since our work is of public nature, we were directly affected by the lockdown, but we learnt to see the good side of it and what we noticed in our immediate surroundings," says Saudamini, adding that this led to an interesting discussion around rare bird sightings, which then sowed the seeds of an interesting story. Called A Zoom Call Re:Birds, the makers call it a performative audio-visual experience made for the digital medium and free from geographical boundaries. "It is an attempt to use the medium of Zoom, which became the medium for work - artistic or otherwise- during the pandemic, and to see what all is possible to combine the narratives of storytelling and audiovisual elements any such platform provides," she explains. Speaking about the story, Saudamini says, "We have combined fictional elements with reality in this play, which is a series of interviews with a young man called A Karruppuraja from Pothakudi village in Tamil Nadu, who found himself at the centre of a grassroots movement triggered by a mysterious bird. He noticed a bunch of Robin's eggs in one of the electricity boards and urged the entire village to keep the street lights off and wait till the eggs hatched. And through this play, we get to know a bit more about the heart of his philosophy and his interest in birds, which enabled him to take this step." Talking about the challenge in trying something new like this, she adds, "One big challenge was how to make a show on a platform that we ourselves get tired of, while also making a convincing case and making it seem intimate, to recreate a sense of community through the narrative." The 60-minute long play is in English and Tamil (with English subtitles) language and has been narrated by both Saudamini and Tushar through graphics and audiovisuals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/indian-ensembles-first-show-post-pandemic-combines-fiction-and-reality/articleshow/81595613.cms||Joyeeta Chakravorty
---||India||50% quota cap must go: states to SC; Centre backs Maha||NEW DELHI: Avoiding the risk of annoying any political constituency on the sensitive issue of reservation, state governments took almost a united stand before the Supreme Court on Tuesday in decrying 50% cap on quota while the Centre supported the Maharashtra government’s law on Maratha reservation, saying it is valid despite breaching the ceiling. A Constitution bench, which is to decide whether the SC’s 1992 verdict needed to be re-examined, was told by various states that the 50% cap imposed by the verdict should go and they should be allowed to decide on the quantum. All these states, including Bihar, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Punjab, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Andhra that have so far filed their written submission and also argued before the bench, were unanimous in their stand that “the 50% cap is not a ‘Lakshman Rekha’ which cannot be crossed”. All the states have come in support of Maharashtra which insisted that the Indra Sawhney verdict be re-examined by a larger bench of 11-judges to do away with the cap in view of changed socio-economic conditions. Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for Jharkhand, contended that the Supreme Court must give "free hand" to states to decide about the quantum of reservation and it should not be decided by the judiciary. "If you go to the hinterland of Gujarat, Rajasthan, Bihar, Odisha then you will see how people are crying for education and jobs. The states have failed to provide them schools and teachers. It has to be done by the government on ground and not by the court. If the government fails then let the people decide and vote them out. Please take a liberal and dispassionate approach on the issue. Law is not static and it should change to fulfil the needs and requirements of changing times as change is inherent in every decision-making process," Sibal said. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta then intervened and said the Centre had nothing more to add to what the attorney general told the bench and the 102nd constitution amendment did not take away the rights of states to identify backward classes. On Maratha reservation, he said, "Centre feels that it (Maharashtra law) is a valid law." Bihar and Rajasthan also contended that the number of backward classes in the states have increased over the years and 50% reservation was not enough to uplift people from those communities and it should be increased. Senior advocate Manish Singhvi, appearing for Rajasthan, said number of OBCs has doubled in the last 26 years as number was 54 in the list which is now 91. He said that Indra Sawhney judgment itself allowed more than 50 percent in some cases and it should not be treated as "Lakshman Rekha". Advocate Manish Kumar, appearing for Bihar, told the bench that number of OBCs has increased from 129 in 1993 to 174 in the state. "Equality cannot be viewed as a snapshot or a still image and should rather be viewed like a film in continuity. Equality or lack of it in 1992 cannot be the same in 2021. The 50 percent ceiling limit was a judicially deprived principle based on the prevailing societal conditions then. The obligation of the state to uplift the backward sections of the society is constrained to an extent by the judgement of Indra Sawhney as it permits breaching the cap of 50 percent in extremely exceptional circumstances," he said. Other states including Karnataka, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh also took a similar stand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/50-quota-cap-must-go-states-to-sc-centre-backs-maha/articleshow/81595459.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

The annual change in WPI notified by the government works out to 0.5% for 2020, the drug prices regulator National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority said on Friday. Prices of scheduled drugs are allowed an increase each year by the drug regulator, in line with the annual WPI. Not enthused with the increase for the year, and having been impacted with nearly 15-20% surge in manufacturing costs during the year, the pharma industry plans to seek a 20% increase, sources told TOI. “We feel the percentage (allowed for increase) is too small. During the pandemic, the industry was impacted by a rise in prices of key raw materials (active pharmaceutical ingredients), sea freight and increase in packaging material, among other rising costs. We plan to ask for an increase as a one-off increase from the government soon,” an industry executive said. Most pharma ingredients and intermediates for manufacturing cardio-vascular, diabetes, antibiotics, anti-infectives and vitamins are imported from China, while for certain active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), dependence on China is around 8090%. Once the pandemic surged in China early last year, there was a disruption in supplies leading to higher costs for Indian drug importers. Further, China increased prices of key inputs by 10-20% once supplies resumed mid-2020. Recently, government extended the increase in price of Heparin injection, which is also used in Covid-19 treatment, till September 2021. In June last year, it had allowed a 50% price hike on Heparin after receiving requests from several companies, citing the rise in cost of APIs imported from China. This was allowed under DPCO (Drug Price Control Order) 2013. The companies had also said that over the years the regulated price has decreased, whereas there has been a consistent increase in the import price of APIs, thereby making it commercially unviable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/prices-of-medicines-to-go-up-a-tad-companies-seek-20-jump/articleshow/81596074.cms||Rupali Mukherjee

Rupala was responding to Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MP Sanjay Singh’s comment in Rajya Sabha on India’s poor rank in the GHI report. “Whenever a street dog gives birth in our village, our women provide them with sheera. Even though at times it bites too, we still give them sheera. So in a country where such tradition exists, and then an NGO comes and gives such a report (regarding hunger index) about our children, we should not be sensitive to such reports,” Rupala said. The minister said the government had written to NGO Welthungerhilfe, which compiles the report, expressing concerns about their methodology, data accuracy and sample size and was yet to hear from them. Singh pointed out that despite being in the top 10 food-producing countries in the world, India still ranks poorly in the hunger index. He also pointed out that neighbouring countries like Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have fared much better. Rupala maintained there is no food shortage in the country as the government has around 529.59 lakh tonnes of buffer stock. “We should have ideally kept 214 lakh tonnes, but we have double the stock. So there is no food shortage at all,” he added. However, Rupala said due to lack of infrastructure, some perishable food gets wasted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/even-stray-dogs-are-fed-here-minister-junks-hunger-report/articleshow/81596094.cms||---

The officials called for questioning next week, by the Enforcement Directorate and the Central Bureau of Investigation, are state security advisor Surajit Kar Purakayastha (Saradha case); principal secretary in chief minister’s office Gautam Sanyal and state additional chief secretary BP Gopalika (Metro Dairy share transfer and disinvestment case); GST special commissioner (Durgapur) Arun Prasad, Kolkata Police additional commissioner Laxmi Narayan Meena and West Bengal Police officer Partha Ghosh (illegal coal-mining case). The fresh notices to these six officials came on Friday, when the ED questioned Trinamool Congress candidates Vivek Gupta (Jorasanko) and Madan Mitra (Kamarhati) in the Saradha case. Another central agency, the National Investigation Agency, questioned another Trinamool candidate, Imani Biswas (Suti), in connection with the February Nimtita railway station blast case. The Trinamool Congress saw political vendetta in the renewed activity of central government agencies in poll-bound Bengal. “The BJP is so brazen about all this now. They don’t even bother to make a pretence of fair play. This is classic Modi-Shah tactic,” Trinamool Rajya Sabha leader Derek O’Brien said. Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee, too, had urged the Election Commission to probe “the role of central agencies in Bengal” while releasing her party’s manifesto; it followed an ED notice to state home secretary HK Dwivedi to appear before it in connection with the Metro Dairy case. A state official admitted the notices had come. “It seems to be part of a political carpet-bombing to keep the state administration under pressure,” he said. Another official close to the developments said there was no question of not cooperating with the agencies. “All things known will be shared.

Maoists make vasectomy mandatory for cadres, restricting them from having children, as they believe it would distract them from their ‘mission’. These six former Maoists, who had given up arms separately in last one and half years, had spoken candidly with Sukma SP K L Dhruv that they wanted to have children and lead a normal family life. They said they were sterilized when they decided to marry their women colleagues while with the Maoists. Police began making arrangements to reverse their vasectomy, Bastar range IG P Sundarraj told TOI. “As a part of our surrender and rehabilitation policy we address this emotional issue and help surrendered cadres lead a normal family life by conducting reverse vasectomy operations,” Sundarraj said, adding that this medical procedure is offered free of cost.

The collegium, comprising CJI Bobde and Justices N V Ramana and R F Nariman, recommended the names of nine advocates — Aruna S Pai, Shailesh P Brahme, Kamal R Khata, Sharmila U Deshmukh, Amira Abdul Razaq, Sandeep V Marne, Sandeep H Parikh, Somasekhar Sundaresan and Mahendra M Nerlikar — and four judicial officers, Rajesh N Laddha, Sanjay G Mehare, G A Sanap and S G Dige, for appointment as Bombay HC judges. The Bombay HC, during the very short tenure of Chief Justice B P Dharmadhikari, had recommended 22 names — 18 advocates and four judicial officers — for appointment as judges of the HC. However, the names had run into serious objection from two consultee judges, Justices A M Khanwilkar and D Y Chandrachud, whose parent HC is Bombay. Justices Khanwilkar and Chandrachud had in writing asked CJI Bobde to send all 22 names back to Bombay HC CJ Dipankar Datta for effective evaluation of merit and maintaining objectivity in the constitutional process of selection of HC judges. Sources said the two judges believed that the Bombay HC, being in the financial capital of the country, required judges with domain knowledge in emerging fields of law and suggested that since Justice Datta had been chief justice for nearly 10 months, he should be asked to reconsider the names. However, Justice B R Gavai approved the names of “deserving” candidates from among the 22 but agreed with Justices Khanwilkar and Chandrachud for returning the remaining names for reconsideration. Justice Gavai did not fault Justice Dharmadhikari for recommending a large number of people for appointment as judges. He said Justice Dharmadhikari had been a judge of the HC since 2004 and had functioned on various benches to have reasonable knowledge about the talent pool in the HC. When CJI Bobde asked Justice Chandrachud to specify his objections against individuals, the latter wrote an even more stinging response and said when he was suggesting reconsideration of the entire list by the Bombay HC, to give opinion on individuals would amount to “cherry picking”, sources said. After less than encouraging views from Justices Khanwilkar and Chandrachud, the CJI had sought the opinion of Justice U U Lalit on the 22 names. With just a little more than a month to go for his retirement, CJI Bobde believed the vacancies in Bombay HC needed to be filled urgently and scheduled the collegium meeting without waiting for Justice Lalit’s response. The meeting found 13 of the 22 names suitable for appointment as judges of Bombay HC. If these are approved by the government and they are appointed as judges, Bombay HC will still have 19 vacancies against a sanctioned strength of 94 judges. Justice Dharmadhikari was acting CJ of Bombay HC from February 20 to March 19 last year. He was CJ from March 20 till his superannuation on April 27, 2020. Justices Khanwilkar and Chandrachud had said it was well nigh impossible for a chief justice to prepare a list of 22 probable candidates for appointment as HC judges within a short span of two months. They said shortlisting a candidate for appointment as a judge required the HC CJ to watch the performance of the advocates, consult bar leaders and colleague judges about the integrity, ability and capability of each individual. They said most of the recommended people were around 55 years old and appointing people of this age group was not advisable as they would have a short tenure of around six years as HC judges, who retire at 62. According to them, most HC judges take at least two to three years to get acquainted with the art of writing judgments and adapting to the discipline intrinsic to the constitutional post. The two judges said it would be in the interest of the justice delivery system to return the 22 names for reconsideration. They said the selection of candidates needed to be broad-based keeping in mind the hopes and aspirations of deserving advocates practising not only in Bombay HC but before its benches in Aurangabad, Nagpur and Panaji.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-collegium-picks-13-names-for-bombay-high-court-judge-posts/articleshow/81597114.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

However, the report also asserted that optimism is taking hold among households, businesses, investors and markets, and India is likely to decouple from other emerging economies that face rising financing costs and a debt pile-up. “Households’ financial savings rate might have fallen further in Q3:2020-21 with the intensification of consumption and economic activity,” the report said. The state of the economy report said that there is an urgency to resume high growth, and incoming data point to even contact-intensive services, such as personal care, recreation and hospitality gathering traction and pace. This, even as agriculture crosses production highs in various crops and in horticulture, and manufacturing stops contracting. It said the Covid-19-induced spike in household financial savings rate in the first quarter of 2020-21 waned substantially in the second quarter in a counter-seasonal manner. While households’ deposits and borrowings picked up, their holdings of currency and savings in mutual funds moderated. Increased household consumption, particularly its discretionary component, could be attributed to resumption in economic activity following the easing of lockdown, it said. “Going forward, optimism on account of mass vaccination is expected to further boost consumption demand and work further towards restoration of the pre-pandemic spending and saving pattern,” the report said. The report also warned that central banks will go beyond their conciliatory “open mouth operations” if their stated stances are challenged. This is in the context of bond investors globally shunning auctions on expectations that yields will rise. “Globally, policies will seek to stimulate, but markets will stare at tea leaves and ghosts of tightening of the past — neither growth nor inflation hard data support market movements so far,” the report said. It said India is poised on the cusp of two tipping points. “First, there are ominous signs that infections are rising. A second wave? Time will tell. On the other hand, vaccinations have moved beyond health workers to senior citizens, but at 3.3 crore as on March 16, the entire process needs to be speeded up,” the report said. Going forward, the vaccination drive and flattening of the infections curve will help improve consumer sentiment, boost business spirits and make the digital payments industry the key driver of the post-Covid revival agenda as it ushers in a transformation in “how we work, learn, shop, pay and live”. The report also said India is likely to decouple from other emerging markets despite debt service accounting for 25% of Budget revenues. According to the report, India is different because the average maturity of government debt is 11 years, which reduces refinancing risks. Another advantage is that most of the public debt is held in India and is less vulnerable to capital outflows. “Also, India has growth credibility — the average rate of interest on public debt is less than the growth rate of the economy,” it said. The report pointed out that, even as countries rush to vaccinate and struggle with resurgent and mutant strains, the lingering effects of the slowdown of global economic activity in Q4:2020 are beginning to fade. “It is more likely now than before that the global economy will regain lost momentum in Q2,” it added. In 2021, domestic inflation will likely ease after June, but it will be higher than in prints because of statistical base effects of high inflation a year ago, it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/household-savings-rate-dips-in-q2-as-spending-goes-up-rbi-report/articleshow/81597123.cms||---

The offensive comments were posted on the wall of a Facebook group named "Indians in New Zealand", reports IP Singh. The Sikh youth, on whose complaint Auckland police registered a case and then arrested the Indian, was called a "Khalistani terrorist", his mobile number was listed on the website, and he was accused of running a malicious hate campaign against all Indians. His photographs were also posted on the social media site and people were urged people to report about him to police. The accused, in his comments in the same FB group, had threatened that he would reach the Sikh man’s house "to teach him a lesson". He had also abused two others in the same comment. It is learned that the arrested man has been accused of not just issuing a threat but also spreading hate. Auckland police may also look into the role of some other Indians. Tension in New Zealand has been brewing after the farmers’ agitation reached Delhi's borders and caught international attention. The bitterness between pro- and anti-farm law groups and activists has also been witnessed in Canada and Australia and cases have been registered in both countries. After acrimonious and abusive exchanges during a Tiranga Maple rally in Brampton, Ontario, on February 28, two separate cases were registered against men who were against the new laws. They were arrested for assaulting two participants of the Tiranga Maple rally in two separate incidents. On the same day in Sydney, after the car of some Sikh youths was attacked with baseball bats and rods, they had alleged that it was a hate crime and the attackers were Indians.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/indian-held-in-new-zealand-for-abusing-sikh-youth-on-fb/articleshow/81597302.cms||IP Singh

Everything happens for a reason and whatever is destined finds its way into your life.” Rita had always dreamt of opening a bakery of her own and having interned at the Maitre Choux in England, she was waiting for the right moment. Along with Corona came fame overnight, and her social media handle now has more than 22,000 followers .“I began ‘Palmier- by Rita’, from my home kitchen to conjure up baked delicacies and also began posting a comical series on my Instagram, which youngsters could well relate to. Most of it is banter from around my home which my brother and I throw around the house regarding growing up which is relatable for tweens, teens and twenties — hence popular,” she explained.Even after a year, Rita is often asked, “Tamey pela Coronawala ben cho ne ?” (Aren’t you the first Corona girl?). But the gutsy female has learnt to laugh it off and take jibes in her stride now. The initial months were tough because even as she was recuperating, there was an invasion on the family’s privacy and rumours were rife. “People made up their own stories about me, posted fake pictures and even got false news published that I had thrown a party for a 100 people – all of which were bogus. I would get ridiculous hate messages by strangers on social media but I strengthened my mind to handle them,” said Rita, who is grateful for the immense emotional support provided by her friends, doctors and her educators from the University in England all of whom formed a support system. “At a time when one is isolated from kin – a support group via communication is extremely important and should be provided to each patient,” she recalls.Pursuing her final year in International Business from Brunel University, London, the Bharatnatyam visharadh has returned home once again, as the course is online. Rita feels everyone should act responsibly to tackle the pandemic. “Earlier, the ignorance had triggered fears, now that we are better informed we should follow the regulations responsibly to contain the virus,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/you-grow-through-what-you-go-through-surats-first-patient/articleshow/81594628.cms||Ashleshaa Khurana

Vaishali SP Maneesh on Friday said the accused Bittan Sahni, aged around 70 years, was arrested immediately after the incident. He said Sahni was forwarded to judicial custody on Friday evening after medical examination. Town police station SHO Subodh Kumar said Sahni came to live with his son, whose house is right opposite the child's house, two years ago. Gradually he became friends with her grandfather. “On Thursday evening, he took the girl inside his room and raped her, as per an FIR lodged by the victim’s mother,” the SHO said, adding, the victim came home crying from Sahni’s room. “Her mother asked her daughter why she was reason crying. The daughter narrated the incident with Sahni inside his room. The mother told the police that her daughter was bleeding,” he said. “The dhoti worn by the accused and the victim’s undergarments have been seized for forensic analysis,” he said. The SHO Kumar said the victim used to call the accused ‘dada’ as he was of her grandfather’s age. Both elders used to spend time together and the victim's family frequently offered him tea and snacks in the evening. He said Sahni lived at his native village in Jandaha but shifted to a separate room located on the ground floor of his son’s two-story house about two years ago. “Surprisingly, he was not allowed to go upstairs where his son’s family lived. The ground floor is given on rent except for one room used by Sahni,” Kumar said. The SHO said the child's family is poor while Sahni has a strong financial background. He said the victim’s medical examination was conducted on Friday and a report was awaited. “Police would submit a charge sheet soon,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/five-year-old-raped-by-grandfathers-friend-in-vaishali/articleshow/81593408.cms||---

The initiative also seeks to promote paperless and hassle-free air travel. “Installation of equipment at various points in the terminal — kerbside kiosks, gates, check-in counters, pre-embarkation security checks and boarding points — is under way. The Covid situation last year led to the delay in arrival of some equipment. The project deadline, has, therefore been revised from this April to July. We are on track to meet it,” said airport director Kaushik Bhattacharjee. Once a passenger registers in the facial biometric-based air travel, or Digi Yatra, at the airport, s/he will not be needed to show a ticket or boarding pass, or even identity cards, at the checkpoints. They will be identified by matching facial biometric at the security points and ticket validation will take place through integration with the airline system. “There will be one-time verification at the departure airport while travelling for the first time using their Aadhaar number, PAN or any other ID approved by the government. After registration, facial recognition biometric will be captured and stored in the Digi Yatra ID. All details of the passenger will be securely recorded in a centralized database,” said a system engineer working on the Digi Yatra project at Kolkata airport. At present, flyers have to show their identity card and boarding pass to the Central Industrial Security Force staff at the airport entry. During rush hour, there are long queues and flyers are required to reach the airport hours in advance given the lengthy check-in process. Once the new technology is introduced, passengers can save considerable time once they reach the airport. Passengers will have to initially register themselves individually at all airports they usually travel through as data sharing between airport operators has not yet commenced. Initially, passengers travelling on IndiGo and Vistara flights can avail of the facility. Gradually, other airlines will be brought on board, although SpiceJet has not agreed to join the Digi Yatra programme yet. “Once the facility is ready, IndiGo and Vistara passengers can opt for seamless travel through Kolkata airport and register on Digi Yatra,” said Bhattacharjee. As of now, eight flights of IndiGo and Vistara have been agreed on at Varanasi airport. Details for Kolkata will be shared in due course.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/facial-recognition-tech-at-airport-soon-for-digi-yatra/articleshow/81595751.cms||Subhro Niyogi

The state cabinet approved it on Tuesday, making Bihar the first state in the country to have an ethanol promotion policy under the National Policy of Biofuels, 2018. The state ethanol policy allows the extraction of ethanol, which was restricted to sugarcane, from surplus quantities of maize as well. An investor will get an additional government subsidy of 15% of the cost of plant and machinery up to a maximum of Rs5 crore, in addition to the existing incentives under the Bihar Industrial Investment Promotion Policy, 2016. Speaking at the launch, Shahnawaz said a tripartite agreement between investors, banks and oil manufacturing companies will act as collateral for secured loans for establishing greenfield standalone ethanol manufacturing units in the state. The industries minister also claimed that the policy would provide remunerative returns to investors and other stakeholders. “It will directly increase the income of farmers producing feedstock or raw material for ethanol manufacturing,” he said. Under the new policy, financial assistance would be provided to greenfield standalone manufacturing units producing fuel-grade ethanol and supplying 100% of their ethanol to oil manufacturing companies under the Centre's ethanol blending programme. Shahnawaz said the policy will create employment and help reduce pollution as currently, bioethanol blending in petrol in India stands at 6.2%, and the government has set a target of 20% bioethanol blending of petrol by 2030. “Bihar in the coming years will help the nation conserve foreign exchange and reduce import burden on account of crude petroleum,” Shahnawaz said. He added, “Currently, India produces 5.30 thousand barrel of ethanol, which is very low compared to countries like USA and Brazil. Bihar produces around 12 crore litres of ethanol and is in the fifth position in ethanol production in the country. With the implementation of this policy, we aim to be the ethanol hub of India and generate 50 crore litres of ethanol every year.” Additional chief secretary, industries department, Brijesh Mehrotra said, “Application for stage 1 clearance for setting up a manufacturing unit through the single window clearance portal will be processed within seven working days. Land allotment by BIADA, after submission of application on the Bihar Industrial Area Development Authority (BIADA) portal, will be cleared within the next seven days.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-1st-state-to-have-own-ethanol-policy-for-biofuel/articleshow/81593346.cms||---

The terse Tata Motors statement did not give any reason for the change of decision. Llistosella, a German, was to join the Mumbai-based company on July 1. The development drags Tata Motors back to square one as chairman N Chandrasekaran will have to find a replacement for outgoing CEO Guenter Butschek. Butschek, whose five-year term at the company ended in February, is on an extension till June 30. “Did not see this coming,” said an auto industry observer, referring to Tata Motors statement. Llistosella (pronounced List-osay-a), said sources, had attended virtual meetings of Tata Motors to become familiar with the affairs of the company. When the automotive expert was appointed as Tata Motors CEO, Llistosella had commented that he was delighted to become a part of the unique Tata family. Having been bonded to India for so many years, a new exciting chapter is now opened. “We would jointly awaken the potential of Tata Motors.” Llistosella, while with Daimler, had a stint in India. The 54-year-old had led Daimler’s foray into the country and had launched BharatBenz trucks, which competed with Tata Motors. In a short period of time, he had made BharatBenz a successful brand within Daimler’s portfolio. An economics grad from the University of Cologne (Germany), he is currently on the board of Swedish electric vehicle maker Einride. The development comes amid Tata Motors striving to narrow down losses in its domestic operations and lower its debt pile. “It is rare for a CEO to drop out especially after the announcement being made. However, actual reasons need to be found out. Most likely reasons could be either last-minute unavoidable development at personal end or strange discovery on the professional side, which would have gone unnoticed during initial discreet checks. In such cases, concerned individuals are given graceful exit without making too much of noise,” said BTI Executive Search MD James Agrawal. “I have come across this kind of situations couple of times over my last two decades of search career.” In the past, Tata Motors had faced leadership crisis with no CEO at the helm. That time, its chairman oversaw the operations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tata-motors-ceo-designate-opts-out/articleshow/81595059.cms||Reeba Zachariah

AKU vice-chancellor S M Karim inaugurated the function by garlanding the life-size statue of great astronomer Aryabhatta on its newly built campus at Mithapur. The message of its founder VC, Shambhu Nath Guha, was also read out on the occasion in which he appreciated the recent development of the university and wished the institution all success. Tracing the history of growth of the university in the last one decade, the VC said it has made considerable progress in a very short span of time. Established in 2010 and built across an area of 7.6 acres, AKU has got nearly 190 affiliated medical, engineering, pharmacy, nursing, education, paramedical and other professional institutions of the state under its jurisdiction. It has got nearly 35,000 students on its roll. Karim pointed out that a full-fledged centre of nano science and nano technology was started in AKU for the first time in the state. Similarly, four other specialised centres, namely Centre for Geographical Studies, Centre for Journalism and Mass Communications, Centre for River Studies and Patliputra School of Economics have been established in the university. “While three of these schools have already started functioning with the appointment of directors and other staff, the school of river studies is yet to get its director. This centre will also start functioning soon with the appointment of its director. All the four study centres will be autonomous in character and AKU will only conduct their examinations and publish the results,” the VC added. Prominent among those who were present on the occasion included directors of different schools, including Purnima Shekhar, Iftekhar Ahmad and Shankar Kumar Bhaumik, AKU’s examination controller Rajiv Ranjan and deputy registrar Kumari Anjana. Students of Impact College, affiliated to AKU, presented a cultural programme on the occasion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/akus-centre-for-river-studies-to-start-functioning-soon-vc/articleshow/81593449.cms||B K Mishra

After preparing Asia’s tallest lion statue in metal, a city artist group has now prepared a 17-feet tall humanoid. Like the lion statue created by the city artists, the gigantic humanoid sculpture too will be installed at the proposed science museum in Rajkot. Three artists – Dipak Singh, Krunal Chaudhari and Ritest Rajput – of the Art Assembly group started working on the humanoid sculpture in December. The sculpture weighing more than 2,000 kg is made of aluminium and metal scrap. “The sculpture is now ready and we will dispatch it to Rajkot soon,” said Rajput, adding that like the lion sculpture, the concept of humanoid too revolves around the ‘Make in India’ theme. In January, the group had prepared the lions sculpture on the ‘Make in India’ logo concept. “It is 21 feet long, 10.5 feet high sculpture. It took more than 840 hours to prepare the lion sculpture which is more than 5,000 kg in weight,” said Rajput, adding that the lion sculpture is to be installed at the entrance gate of the museum. It is touted to be world’s third largest lion sculpture (metal) and Asia’s biggest lion sculpture. “We had prepared the lion sculpture using automobile parts, especially gears of machinery. It was not just about replicating the ‘Make in India’ logo. To emphasize the concept of working together, we prepared the sculpture design in such a way that each machinery part is connected to the other,” he said. The trio’s sculptures are now placed at different parts of country. Two of their creations — the ‘Rock Star’ at O P Road and ‘Chair’ at the sculpture park — are installed in Vadodara. The ‘Flying Bus’ created by them is installed at Bandra-Kurla Complex in Mumbai while the ‘Guitar’ and ‘Bicycle’ adorns the Phoenix market city premises in Bengaluru.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/vadodara-mega-sculpture-to-adorn-rajkot-museum/articleshow/81594471.cms||Prashant Rupera
---||Patna||Panel to probe ‘misuse’of Vidyapeeth campus||PATNA: A committee of Bihar legislative council will investigate the use of Bihar Vidyapeeth campus for commercial purposes. Acting chairperson of the legislative council, Awadhesh Narain Singh, issued instructions in this regard on Friday. Singh said though such a committee had been formed earlier, the report was never tabled as members got retired and investigation was not completed. However, as several members demanded formation of a new committee to investigate the matter, Singh agreed. The matter was earlier raised by Congress MLC Prem Chandra Mishra on March 13. Mishra said Bihar Vidyapeeth was set up by Mahatma Gandhi during freedom movement for educational, social and cultural activities and the campus also had Rajendra Smriti Museum. “However, the campus is now being used for commercial purposes and also leased for weddings and parties. Ten rooms have been allotted to police battalion. On February 14, a party was organised on the campus to celebrate Valentine’s Day,” Mishra said. State art and culture minister Alok Ranjan, however, said an officer in the rank of deputy director had visited the campus on March 15 and found no evidence of commercial activities. To this, RJD MLC Sunil Kumar Singh said he had attended wedding parties twice on the Vidyapeeth campus. Meanwhile, replying to a short-notice question raised by Radha Charan Sah in the council, state science and technology minister Sumit Kumar Singh said the government was trying to ensure campus placement of students in engineering and polytechnic colleges in the state. “Over 400 students have got jobs through campus selection this year,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/panel-to-probe-misuseof-vidyapeeth-campus/articleshow/81593542.cms||Sheezan Nezami

The scheme will help in curbing climate change. The move will save 2025 million kilowatt of energy per year.” He added, “According to present national average, 21-hour power supply is being provided but efforts are on to ensure 24-hour power supply at the earliest. In 2015, PM Narendra Modi had promised to provide electricity to all the villages within 1,000 days and we ensured that before the due time.” Bhojpur DM Roshan Kushwaha, SP Har Kishore Rai, Barhara MLA Raghvendra Pratap Singh, officials from CESL, power ministry and local BJP leaders were present at the event.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/gram-ujala-scheme-rural-people-get-led-bulbs-at-rs-10-per-piece/articleshow/81593473.cms||---
---||Business||After lockdown washout, FY21 sees hit IPOs||MUMBAI: In the biggest week for IPOs in India in over a year, six companies closed their issues on Friday, together mobilising a little over Rs 4,500 crore. Two companies were also listed during this period and both at a premium to the offer prices despite a weak market, thus capping a week that signals strong investor demand for good issues at attractive prices, industry players pointed out. The week started with the closure of Anupam Rasayan’s Rs 760-crore IPO and Thursday saw the close of the Rs 1,173-crore IPO for Kalyan Jewellers, one of the leading organised retail jewellers in India. The hectic week ended with the Rs 582-crore offer for Nazara Technologies, the first Indian gaming company to go public, which closed with a subscription of over 107 times. The week also saw listing of MTAR Technologies that nearly doubled on its first day on the bourses at Rs 1,082 compared to its IPO price of Rs 575. And on Friday, Easy Trip Planners listed at Rs 209, up 11% from its offer price of Rs 187, data on bourses showed. So far in the current fiscal, the first three months till June, was a washout for public offers due to the nationwide lockdown that started in the last week of March. The Rs 497-crore Rossari Biotech in mid-July was the first IPO of the current fiscal, followed by the Rs 15,000-crore rights offer for Yes Bank. According to Dharmesh Mehta, MD & CEO, DAM Capital Advisors, one of the leading merchant bankers in the public offering space, retail investors have been one of the driving forces for the IPOs in recent times. However, “one will have to lower the listing expectations and invest very selectively”, he said. Mehta also sees a good IPO pipeline in the coming months. The market is expected to see record filings of IPOs in 2021 and large size offerings in the latter half of this year. “Investors have made huge returns in majority of the IPOs in the past six months and a bullish Indian market will help to raise record money in 2021 from capital markets.” A large part of the Rs 4,522-crore that flowed into the market this week was from institutional investors, including foreign investors. And this foreign fund flow, to some extent, is supporting the strength of the rupee, market players said. The rupee is holding its ground around the 73-to-the-dollar mark despite the recent strength of the greenback. Support by the RBI is understood to be the main reason for this strength of the rupee, they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/after-lockdown-washout-fy21-sees-hit-ipos/articleshow/81595163.cms||---

The proposed Bill will be taken up in the House for amendments on March 23. On Friday, the members of the House had been provided advance copies, so that they could submit the amendments to the assembly secretariat for discussion on March 23. Speaker Vijay Kumar Sinha adjourned the House till Tuesday within 20 minutes of the sitting. The BSAP Bill, 2021, proposes that the government will constitute a new Bihar special armed police whose personnel and officials will be deployed to protect industrial units, important institutions, airport and metro rail on the pattern of Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) or other paramilitary forces of the Centre. The proposed Bill defines the functions and powers of BSAP. Besides, the sections also have bearing on the regulation of the activities of the BSAP personnel and officials, both when on duty and off duty. The opposition members feared that the powers given to the newly formed Bihar Special Armed Police force through the proposed BSAP Bill, 2021, will lead to its misuse. They took strong exception to the Section 7 of the proposed Bill, which give special powers to the newly constituted police force, whereby they can arrest any person without warrant on mere suspicion of the likely threat to an installation from the person concerned. The ruckus began as soon as the House met to consider proposals pertaining to non-government resolutions from members of the House for the consideration of the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ruckus-in-assembly-over-police-bill/articleshow/81593551.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Kolkata||West Bengal elections 2021: Kolkata Police plans stricter night vigil||KOLKATA: The police in added areas of Kolkata — which go to polls on May 6 and 10 — have decided to step up their presence on the road, especially at night. As a first step, senior officers led by DCPs and ACPs will now be on night naka rounds in the added areas starting this weekend. This was decided after a meeting between Lalbazar and senior Election Commission officials. Lalbazar has also hinted that it will introduce day nakas in the coming two weeks in these areas. Bidhannagar police have started checks where IPS officers and officers from the DM’s office are present in and around the airport and Salt Lake areas.  “The presence of senior officers is a step to rule out apprehensions of politically motivated moves,” said an officer. Even as the presence of central forces in these areas is being gradually increased, the main focus will be on rogue bikes after specific complaints from added areas. Surprise block chain raids will be carried out across the city closer to the elections, said police sources. “We had a long discussion with various observers, the DEO and his officials on the prevailing law-and-order situation and the steps that can be taken to improve confidence among voters in Jadavpur, Tollygunge and Behala. It has been decided that daily movement of paramilitary forces and their interaction with locals have to be notified and all political campaigning videographed,” said an officer who was part of the meeting held on Thursday. Cops said the most important aspect over the next three weeks will be securing the borders.  “The list of criminals and those who are known to be creating trouble on election day have been shared with bordering SPs, especially in Baruipur and Diamond Harbour. The information is being constantly updated. Maximum stress is on nakas near the borders,” said another officer. Each police station has been asked to monitor and carry out videography of local agitations if necessary. “Interventions for any local issue have to be faster and senior officers should be involved from an early stage. Every police station has also been asked to implement the Supreme Court-mandated guidelines and run a dedicated women’s help desk,” an officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kp-plans-stricter-night-vigil-ahead-of-elections/articleshow/81595837.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Covid rules for ‘Year of the Family’, Easter celebrations||KOLKATA: The archdiocese of Kolkata started celebrating the Year of the Family from Friday, which will continue for more than a year. This was in keeping with the announcement made by Pope Francis in Rome where Amoris Laetitia will be celebrated up to June 26, 2022.  According to a communique from Archbishop Thomas D Souza to all Catholic churches under the archdiocese, the formal inauguration of the year of the family was carried out at St Joseph’s Chapel, Market Street, on Friday.  The day is also observed as the Solemnity of St Joseph. On Maundy Thursday, April 1, according to Archbishop D Souza’s instructions, there will be no traditional “washing of feet” in the churches for fear of infection. Unlike last year, permission has been given even for the midnight rituals at churches. The mass will be organized as usual, the Blessed Sacrament will be exposed till midnight and groups will be assigned for the adoration of the Lord. However, the communique stressed on caution. On Good Friday, the Way of the Cross has been allowed to be held in public. Churchgoers will be allowed to pray at all the 14 stations that depict the events from Pilate’s ordering the crucifixion to the final laying of Jesus in the tomb. But priests have been asked to ensure there is no crowding.  During the veneration of the Cross, kissing or touching of the cross will not be allowed and all churchgoers have been asked to join hands in veneration only. The archbishop has also allowed the Easter Vigil this time, followed by the midnight mass on April 3, but churches could choose to organize it earlier than midnight. “We must be careful to plug gaps. The family is the domestic church where we pray, eat, share joys and sorrows. In the pandemic, we have experienced that even more closely, hence the year of the family,” said Dominic Gomes, vicar general of the archdiocese.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/covid-rules-for-year-of-the-family-easter-celebrations/articleshow/81595808.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Business||‘Markets don’t realise economy can’t withstand higher rates now’||MUMBAI: Reserve Bank of India officials have again called out bond vigilantes, who are prowling the financial markets, raising the spectre of high yields and has warned that central banks hold the Brahmastra — asset purchases. Pointing out the recent exercise by the Reserve Bank of Australia to defend lower yield on bonds, the RBI report on the ‘state of the economy’ said that markets do not realise “that there is no way the economy can withstand higher interest rates in its current state”. “There is much sense in what the Reserve Bank is doing in striving to ensure an orderly evolution of the yield curve. But it takes two to tango and forestall a tandav (dance of destruction),” said the report. The report is authored by RBI staff, including Michael Patra, deputy governor in charge of monetary policy. The report hits out at commentators who have been saying that high-interest rates will be a price that the economy would have to pay for high government borrowing. Bond yields in March have remained volatile despite repeated assurances by RBI governor Shaktikanta Das that the central bank would absorb a big chunk of the borrowing and the net borrowing for the next fiscal would be only Rs 9 lakh crore, which is very manageable. The benchmark 10-year yield, which had averaged 5.93% from April 2020 to January 2021, surged to 6.13% on February 2 on the announcement of the market borrowing programme of the central government, reportedly higher than what was expected. While the RBI did manage to tame yields back to 5.96% by February 11, a surge in US treasury yields triggered selling of bonds worldwide and the return on the Indian 10-year benchmark hit 6.23%, less than 50 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point) at which banks were offering home loans. According to the RBI, the foundations of economic revival have been laid by a slew of unconventional policy measures that it undertook during the pandemic. These include long-term repo operations to facilitate monetary transmission and support credit offtake. The central bank also undertook an ‘operation twist’ where it simultaneously sold and bought bonds to compress the premium investors demanded on longer-term bonds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/mkts-dont-realise-eco-cant-withstand-higher-rates-now/articleshow/81595274.cms||---

A damaged live wire had come in contact with the iron gate, police said. The victim was identified as Chanchala Kumari (8), a resident of Jale. Her father Bharat Jha owns a small shop selling salt, candles and matchboxes. Chanchala’s six classmates and a teacher, Sunita Kumari, were injured as they received electric shocks while trying to save her. Shockingly, Darbhanga district education officer Mahesh Prasad Singh has blamed rats for the incident. “It seems the electric wire was nibbled by rats. The damaged part of the wire came in contact with the iron door of the classroom which Chanchala touched,” he said. Singh said the injured schoolteacher and six students were rushed to hospital where their condition is stated to be stable. Meanwhile, Darbhanga DM (incharge) Tanai Sultania said action would be taken against erring officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/schoolgirl-dies-of-electrocution/articleshow/81593459.cms||Debashish Karmakar

After graduation, Basha started selling vegetables in the local market, unable to find a suitable job. Lady luck knocked on his door when local legislator and chief whip Gadikota Srikanth Reddy decided to field Basha as the party nominee from ward 9. Basha contested the election on the insistence of locals and YSRC activists. He won without much difficulty. To his shock, chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy advised chief whip Srikanth Reddy to select Basha as Rayachoti municipal chairman. “I never dreamt about entering politics. I became municipal chairman thanks to the chief minister and Srikanth Reddy,” said Basha who plans to develop Rayachoti as a model town. For S Amuda of Chittoor, a daily wage worker, life took a turn when YSRC chose her as its mayoral candidate. An SSC pass, Amuda eked out a living selling firewood in the city. Local legislator A Srinivasulu fielded her as corporator candidate from an SC reserved seat. Sources said rival factions in YSRC proposed different names for the mayor post. However, the chief minister vetoed the proposals and selected Amuda. “It’s a god-given opportunity. I believe only Jagan Mohan Reddy can take such decisions to empower the poor and weaker sections,” said Amuda. Interestingly, Dr Sirisha was also a surprise choice of the party to become the first mayor of Tirupati. Her father-in-law, Muneyya, worked as an attender in Tirupati municipality. She became the civic body chief where her father-in-law worked as a Class IV employee. Street vendor, Talari Rajesh Kumar, has long been a YSRC sympathiser. However, he had no courage to contest the elections in view of his financial background. YSRC chose him as a candidate for ward 10, reserved for BC (general) category. “I pleaded with the party leaders that I have no money to contest elections. Our MLA Ushasri Charan told me chief minister YS Jagan’s image itself is a big investment and there was no need of money,” explained Rajesh. He was elected councilor without spending a penny. “While becoming councilor itself is a big achievement, the party made me the chairman,” said Rajesh Kumar, breaking into tears.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/skys-the-limit-for-daily-wagers-helming-civic-bodies/articleshow/81592863.cms||Samdani MN

While random tests are being done at the airport, railway stations and bus stands, Patna divisional commissioner Sanjay Kumar Agarwal has asked officials concerned to use loudspeakers to raise awareness at the crowded places in six districts falling under the division. He said officials in Patna, Nalanda, Bhojpur, Buxar, Rohtas and Kaimur have been asked to make people aware about the Covid appropriate behaviour like use of masks and keeping distance through loudspeakers in local markets, bus stands and other crowded places. He said these districts have also been asked to increase testing and carry out targeted screening of people with special focus on those returning from affected states. “The recent contacts of all those testing positive will be traced and tested. Colony, lane or the tola having Covid positive patients will be declared micro containment zones. As Holi is likely to draw rush in the local markets selling vegetables, fruits, sweets, clothes and colours, officials have been asked to raise awareness through loudspeakers,” Agarwal added. Patna district administration has set up a control room to help visitors undergo medical test and avail treatment in case of testing positive. Patna DM Chandrasekhar Singh said screening was being done at the airport, Mithapur and Bankipur bus stands, Rajendra Nagar station, Danapur and Patna Junction. As many people may come through roads, their screening will be done by the medical teams of primary health centres and other government hospitals. Patna civil surgeon Dr Vibha Kumari said 10 medical teams have been deputed at railway stations and airport to screen those coming from affected states. She said random screening may also be conducted in crowded markets before the Holi festival. Meanwhile, the Saran district administration has asked officials to take action against those not wearing masks at public places. Saran DDC Amit Kumar, who is officiating as the DM, said Holi Milan functions will not be allowed at public places. He also appealed to the MPs and MLAs to create awareness among people.

Das told TOI that he was being humiliated by the party’s in-charge for the last three months. Decisions about the Bengal polls were being taken without taking his views. Sources said Das wanted to contest from the Tarakeswar assembly seat in Hooghly district. But he was not given the ticket. Rabindra Singh, who is currently in Kolkata, told TOI over the phone, “If Das has resigned from the party post, the party’s chief would hopefully accept his resignation because he has left the war-field amid electoral war in West Bengal.” Singh also said if Das had any grievance, he should have consulted the party’s senior leaders before sending his resignation. “He was a senior leader. He should not have left the war ground in the middle of the election.” Singh also clarified that Das was allotted a party symbol from the Tarakeswar seat. “But he did not turn up before the party leaders to collect his symbol,” Singh said. Friday was the last date for filing nominations for the Tarakeswar seat which goes to the polling in the third phase.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/jolt-for-jdu-as-its-bengal-unit-president-ashoke-das-quits/articleshow/81593649.cms||Madan Kumar

Of the 37 seats, 13 were won by its Bihar ally BJP in the 2016 assembly polls. Though JD(U) and BJP are allies in Bihar, both are fighting the Assam polls separately. Friday was the last date of filing nomination for the third and last phase of the election. “JD(U is contesting six seats in the first phase (March 27), nine seats in the second phase (April 1), and 22 seats in the third phase (April 6),” said JD(U) national secretary and the in-charge for the northeast, Sanjay Verma, over the phone from Guwahati. Verma also claimed that JD(U) candidates are putting up a good fight in two of the six seats in the first phase. “Our candidates-- Shahnaz Begum in Dhing constituency and Anupam Baruah in Batadroba - are giving a tough fight to their rivals,” he said. Of the 37 seats where JD(U) has fielded its candidates, 13 were won by BJP, 11 by Congress, six (AIUDF), four (Bodoland Peoples’ Front), two (Asom Gana Parishad) and one seat (Jonai) by an Independent in the last 2016 assembly polls. Bihar's another regional party – Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) is also contesting the Assam polls. However, RJD is contesting only from Tinsukia as an ally of the Congress-led 8-party Grand Alliance. RJD has put up Hira Devi, a Tinsukia-based businesswoman, as its candidate. Hira Devi was born and brought up in Bihar’s Bhagalpur district. She shifted to Tinsukia after her marriage in 1984. JD(U), too, has put up its candidate from Tinsukia dominated by the Hindi speaking community. Alok Ray is JD(U) candidate in Tinsukia seat.

Since the trading halt on NSE, the country’s largest exchange, it was believed that the trouble originated at two telecom service providers that led to stoppage of trading. The trading session was extended by one and half hours till 5pm to mainly help investors limit their losses after consultations among the government, Sebi, NSE and BSE, depositories and clearing corporations. The major issue was the ineffectiveness of interoperability because of shutting down of the NCL, the RBI said in its ‘state of the economy bulletin’. “While NSE’s trades are cleared by NCL, trades on the BSE are cleared through Indian Clearing Corporation. In 2018, Sebi had announced interoperability between these two clearing corporations to help brokers consolidate their clearing and settlement functions at a single clearing house, irrespective of the stock exchange on which the trade is executed,” the central bank said in the report. During the February 24 trading outage, NSE said that it had “multiple telecom links with two service providers to ensure redundancy and we have received communication from both the telecom service providers that there are issues with their links due to which there is an impact on the NSE system”. “Another important failure was the inability to switch operations to the disaster recovery site,” the RBI said. “Robust risk management system encompassing disaster management and recovery are essential components for the smooth functioning of a stock exchange,” it noted. The central bank also flagged that according to brokers, timely communication and clarification (from the NSE) could have averted the panic selloff by online traders on the BSE and prevented huge losses to investors. Allowing Nifty and the sensex to trade on all the stock exchanges, extension of interoperability to include usage of trading infrastructure of another exchange and allowing entry of more exchanges to increase competition may need to be considered, besides focusing on strengthening of risk management frameworks at the exchanges,” the RBI noted. A day after the NSE’s trading blackout, Association of National Members of India, a pan-India association of brokers had suggested that contracts on Nifty and the sensex should be allowed to be traded on both the leading bourses of India. Currently, while Nifty is traded only on the NSE, the sensex is traded only on BSE. After the NSE blackout, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said that it had cost the country and lessons were being learnt. Around the same time Sebi also set up a technical committee for a ‘root cause analysis’ of the failure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/failure-at-nse-clearing-arm-led-to-feb-outage-says-rbi/articleshow/81595442.cms||---

Devesh, an alumnus of JNU, a journalist for 20 years, a senior functionary of BJP’s Bihar unit and now an MLC, shares his journey of life with TOI’s Sheezan Nezami. Experts: You have spent two decades of your life in journalism and then shifted to politics. Now, you are an MLC. Tell us about your experiences. I started my career as a reporter in 1994 and held senior positions in leading media houses for two decades. My job as a journalist was to create awareness among people about problems in society. As a member of the legislative council too, my job will remain the same. I will highlight the problems faced by people and the development agenda of Narendra Modi-led central government and Nitish Kumar-led state government. Who inspired you to join politics? I belong to a political family. My grandfather Pandit Yamuna Karjee was a peasant movement leader. Another person who influenced me was PM Narendra Modi. His aura and persona had a great impact on me. He was the one who inspired me to quit journalism and join politics to become a social agent. Large number of youth had voted for BJP in 2014 and they were all inspired by PM Modi. I was among them. Why did you choose Bihar to start your political career even though you have worked for quite a long time in Delhi? When I left Bihar, I studied in Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) and then got a job in Delhi. But somewhere in the back of my mind, a feeling to serve people of my state was always there. Even late Arun Jaitely had advised me to shift to Bihar and enter politics. Being a member of the Upper House, what will be your priorities? One has to highlight the problems of entire state and not one particular district or constituency. I will primarily focus on issues related to education, health and environment. What are your future aspirations? Bihar has been witnessing developmental activities since 2005 when the NDA government came to power in the state. Our job is to help the government accelerate the pace of development. My aspiration is to work with the motto of ‘sarv sparshi, sarv vyapi’. Panchayat elections are round the corner. Even though it is not fought on party lines in Bihar, all the political parties seem to be gearing up for it. What about BJP? The BJP has already drawn a road map for panchayat elections. We aim to have our candidates as zila parishad members. Any party which wants to grow has to draw people from the grassroots level and the three-tier election is the best medium to catch the attention of rural voters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/its-pm-modi-who-inspired-me-to-join-politics/articleshow/81593436.cms||Sheezan Nezami

The textbook has statements that have drawn the ire of Muslim organisations and some persons even ransacked a book shop at Dhamini Market on March 17. “The attack on the passbook shop was organised and no less than a terrorist attack. The statement that Islamic terrorism is a strand of Islam, which is part of the textbook by Rajasthan Board of Secondary Education (RBSE), is what the world believes in. Recently, Sri Lanka banned burqa in their country,” said Lahoty. He added that on the statement that whether Muslim terrorism exists or not, if Congress was given time to speak on the issue, why were BJP MLAs not allowed to do so. “I have been trying to raise the issue of Islamic terrorism in the Assembly but prevented from doing so,” said Lahoty, who demanded that sedition charges should be slapped against those who ransacked the office of Sanjiv Passbook.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/govt-didnt-allow-bjp-mlas-to-speak-lahoty-on-textbook-row-on-islam/articleshow/81595170.cms||---

Addressing reporters on Friday, vice-president of GFP Durgadas Kamat demanded that the newly-appointed state election commissioner (SEC) ensures that he “upholds the Constitution of India and the true spirit of democracy” by taking steps to ensure that the counting of votes for all these polls and bypolls are held together. He said that “all options, including moving the court, are open” for the GFP if the SEC fails to heed their demand. “If need be, the SEC may seek proper advice from the Election Commission of India and save himself from embarrassment (if the matter is taken to the court),” Kamat said. GFP president Vijai Sardesai, Kamat said, has already met with the SEC and placed the demand before him. “We would like to appeal to the SEC not to be a puppet of this government. All options are open before us if the SEC behaves as an agent of the state government,” Kamat said. Two petitioners in the case filed before the high court regarding the matter – Rumaldo Fernanades and Fouziya Shaikh – have already submitted a petition to the SEC over the demand, it was informed. Sardesai had earlier said that announcing the results of six municipal councils and the Corporation of City of Panaji (CCP) will have a “bandwagon effect” on the trend of voting in the rest of the five elections which, he said, won’t go well with the spirit of polling.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gfp-wants-votes-of-all-polls-to-be-counted-together/articleshow/81595175.cms||---

Speaking to the media after a meeting convened by guardian minister Nitin Raut to review the Covid-19 situation here, the southwest Nagpur MLA said the lockdown had adversely affected the common man and led to big losses to the economy. “Even Union minister Nitin Gadkari and other BJP legislators are of the same opinion. The minister also responded positively to our suggestions," he said. Agreeing that Covid-19 patient numbers have witnessed a big spike, Fadnavis said there was an urgent need to increase vaccination centres in the city. "MLCs including Pravin Datke and mayor Dayashankar Tiwari have suggested to have vaccination centres in all 151 wards to boost the drive. Currently, we have 88 centres here. In the coming days, if the central government agrees, we will try to open 32 more vaccination centres." The former chief minister said the administration should take help of NGOs to open designated vaccination centres. "Currently, we have 6.87 lakh citizens of over 60 and over 45 years of age having comorniditoes. This amounts to 6.87% of the total population. We need to increase vaccination to 30,000-40,000 per day, which currently is 10,000 per day. All our public representatives and the mayor would help the administration in this drive," he said. Pointing out that the number of Covid-19 beds weren't increased by the administration even after the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court's directives last year, Fadanvis said he and other public representatives had discussed on the need to ramp up beds as well as designated Covid-19 hospitals in the city to cater to increasing number of patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/complete-lockdown-not-a-solution-strict-restrictions-needed-fadnavis/articleshow/81604897.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Seeing that very few of the ruling party MLAs were present in the house, opposition leader Gulab Chand Kataria sought division and voting for passing the bills. When the chair insisted on passing the bills by a voice vote, they stormed to the well of the house creating an uproar. The chair then had to adjourn the house for half an hour. The ruling party floor managers managed to mobilise a few MLAs. When the house reassembled, many MLAs had left for their homes. Finally, the bills were passed by voice vote amidst ruckus by the opposition. The Rajasthan laws amendment bill makes provision for revocation of land allotment by local bodies for misrepresentation of facts and violation of terms and conditions of allotment, while the Rajasthan municipalities amendment bill 2021 provides for nomination of members to local bodies. It provides for nomination of six persons in case of municipal corporation, five persons in case of municipal council and four persons in case of municipalities, having special knowledge or experience in municipal administration, to be nominated by the state government.

He said economic rebalancing is now driving political and cultural rebalancing, with China being the best example. The Union minister, who was speaking at a webinar organised by the International Centre Goa (ICG), also said that with India expected to become a leading power by the end of the current decade, it was important for the nation to understand the value of its own traditions. “You are seeing a revolution in the making as you can see an inclusive society being built,” he said. ICG invited Jaishankar to participate in the ‘Development Dialogue’ series during which he was asked about his book, ‘The India Way: Strategies for an Uncertain World’. Quoting examples from the Mahabharata to make his point, the minister spoke about the need for India to retain a moral high ground as a new world order gets established. “Today the global order is being challenged by economic rebalancing, political rebalancing and now, cultural rebalancing,” said Jaishankar. “As an economy got stronger and became a major economy, it naturally wanted to assert its political interests. The most notable is China.” Without directly naming China, Jaishankar said the policy framework and mindset of some nations puts a premium on deception and the ability to fool other nations. “In domestic and international politics, being morally and ethically good has its own value but it is also smarter. In other traditions, there is a premium put on deception. You become a serial deviant from the norms and rules and at some stage, people are going to figure it out,” Jaishankar said. Citing examples from the lives of the Pandavas and India’s own Covid-19 vaccine diplomacy, Jaishankar said it is important for India to build a reputation of a trustworthy ally and leader. “In today’s international relations, if you build a reputation as a helpful country, as someone who will stand-up for others, who will go out of the way to help, I do think it matters,” the Union minister said. While he credited Mahatma Gandhi for leading India’s freedom struggle and for helping India assert itself in the face of colonial powers, he said India had to compromise on various aspects in its early years. The minister, who has served as the foreign secretary from 2015-18, said that as India evolves towards its role as a world power, it is important for Indians to understand the importance of the nation’s heritage, culture and tradition. He argued that in everything, from foreign policy to nationalism, India needs to shed western concepts and draw from its own traditions, including lessons from the Mahabharata. Jaishankar illustrated this by pointing out that the way the West perceives nationalism is completely different from the way Asian countries perceive it. “Nationalism is regaining independence from foreign rule. For us, nationalism is an expression of national confidence and ambition of our society. In our context, it is a very positive term,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/inclusive-society-being-built-india-undergoing-revolution-jaishankar/articleshow/81595295.cms||---
---||Delhi||March-end target: 1.3 lakh Covid jabs daily in Delhi||NEW DELHI: All government hospitals in Delhi have been asked to create at least six vaccination sites on their premises from Monday as the state government prepares to expand the vaccination coverage as a measure to check the surge in Covid-19 cases. All vaccination sites will also target 200 inoculations in a day. By March-end, the city is likely to have 1,000 vaccination sites that will be able to provide the protective injection to 1.25 lakh individuals daily. Currently, only around 35,000 individuals receive the Covid shots in a day across the capital. While putting this new measure into effect on Thursday, Delhi government’s department of health and family welfare said, “To accelerate the pace of vaccination, it is hereby ordered that all the government hospitals under Delhi government should increase the vaccination sites in their hospitals to at least six vaccination sites. Further, the hospitals should depute two vaccinators at each of the new additional vaccination sites in their hospital to increase the total slots for vaccination at each site to 200.” Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital is ready to set up the six vaccination booths. A government official said government and private hospitals all have adequate space to install the six recommended booths, each with three distinct spaces for verification, vaccination and observation. The vaccination programme is in focus once again because the number of Covid cases in the city have surged once again. Delhi recorded over 600 new cases on Thursday, the highest in around two and a half months. A day earlier, new cases topped 500. Nearly nine lakh people — healthcare workers, frontline workers, senior citizens and people in the 45 to 59 age group with 20 different types of comorbidities — have been vaccinated in Delhi till now, but the progress of the coverage as a ratio to the population of the capital is very low. The vaccination option is currently not open to everyone, and the programme is being administered according to central government guidelines. As on Thursday, the city had 542 vaccination sites located at around 200 government and private hospitals and healthcare facilities. Covaxin is being administrated at 151 vaccination sites, and Covishield at 391 locations. Both the private and the government facilities are recording an encouraging turnout every day. In all, 40,564 individuals received the Covid shots on Thursday, including 18,976 senior citizens. “All hospitals have been asked to provide Covid vaccination on their premises from 9am till 9pm from Monday (March 22). It is likely to significantly increase the vaccination coverage because in the warm weather, people would probably like to visit the hospitals in the evening,” said a government official. CM Arvind Kejriwal has appealed to the Centre to relax the vaccination restriction and open up the process to everyone aged above 18 years. This would enable the vaccination exercise to be taken up on a bigger scale. If the Centre complied, Delhi could be fully vaccinated within three months, the CM argued.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/march-end-target-1-3l-covid-jabs-daily/articleshow/81595300.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||World||Up to Pakistan to create climate suitable for talks: India||NEW DELHI: In the wake of “peace signals” from Pakistani PM Imran Khan and Army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa, the Centre on Friday iterated the onus was on the neighbour to create an atmosphere conducive for the two sides to address outstanding issues bilaterally. This was even as diplomatic sources confirmed that Indian and Pakistani foreign ministers, S Jaishankar and Shah M Qureshi respectively, were likely to participate in the Heart of Asia (Istanbul process) conference, an initiative for peace in Afghanistan, in Dushanbe on March 30. In Rajya Sabha, the government called for "credible, verifiable and irreversible" action by Pakistan to not allow any territory under its control to be used for cross border terrorism against India in any manner. Sources in Delhi and Islamabad neither confirmed nor denied reports of a meeting between the two. However, an official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the possibility of a "pull aside" on the margins of the conference couldn't be ruled out with both sides looking to build upon the ceasefire agreement last month. It was on the sidelines of the same conference in 2015 in Islamabad that the two sides had unsuccessfully tried to revive the dialogue process in the name of comprehensive bilateral dialogue. The government's statement, in response to questions on the recent ceasefire agreement, came after the Pakistan Army chief appealed to the two countries to bury the past and move forward but added that it was India's responsibility to create a conducive environment. While the ceasefire agreement has fuelled speculation about a possible rapprochement, official sources said it was incumbent upon Pakistan to shun cross-border terrorism and also ensure that the ceasefire held before any step was considered in the direction of normalisation of ties. On multilateral fora, like at the UNHRC this week, India has continued to accuse Pakistan of exporting terrorism. In reply to a written question, junior foreign minister V Muraleedharan recalled that during the visit of then foreign minister Sushma Swaraj to Pakistan in December 2015, it was decided to have a meeting at the level of the foreign secretaries to work out the modalities of the comprehensive bilateral dialogue. However, the meeting could not take place due to the terrorist attack on the Pathankot airbase in January 2016 and the continued support, he said, to cross-border terrorism and ceasefire violations by Pakistan. "The government’s consistent position has been that India desires normal neighbourly relations with Pakistan and is committed to addressing issues, if any, bilaterally and peacefully in an atmosphere free of terror, hostility and violence," the minister said. He added that India and Pakistan maintained regular channels of communication through the respective high commissions and other established mechanisms such as hotlines, flag meetings and scheduled talks between the Directorate Generals of Military Operations (DGMO). Through these well-established mechanisms, the government regularly takes up all cases of unprovoked ceasefire violations and support for cross-border terrorist infiltration by Pakistani forces, he said. Pakistan has been consistently called upon to abide by it’s 2003 ceasefire commitment for maintaining peace and tranquillity along the international boundary and the LoC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/up-to-pakistan-to-create-climate-suitable-for-talks-india/articleshow/81597337.cms||---

This includes HCWs who received the first dose free of cost at a private hospital. This comes even as the private hospitals have to wait for two to three days for the vaccine after payment. “The government hospitals are overcrowded and HCWs have difficulty getting a vaccine appointment there. The private hospitals must wait a minimum 48 hours for the vaccine doses after payment,” said Dr Gopikumar P, secretary, Indian Medical Association’s (IMA), Kerala chapter. A senior health official said that they are only following central government’s directives and now there is no facility to provide free vaccines to private hospitals. However, public health experts said that paid vaccines are for the general public and not HCWs. While a few private hospitals and private medical colleges have decided to vaccinate their staff at their own expense, others have asked their staff to either get vaccinated at a government facility or pay for the same. This includes medical students in private colleges. “Since March first week, private hospitals and medical colleges are supplied vaccines only after payment is made. There are no free vaccines available for HCWs. Due to this, many HCWs in private hospitals who received the first dose free at their workplace had to either go to a government hospital for a free second dose or pay for it. There are many HCWs who didn’t take a single dose and will now have to pay for the same,” said Kerala Christian Professional College Managements Federation’s Fr Francis Pallikunath.  Medical students in government and a few senior medical students in private colleges have been vaccinated, while others in many private colleges have not been vaccinated yet. “None of our students have been vaccinated yet. Their name is yet to appear in the list for vaccination for HCWs”, said Dr KM Navas, president, Kerala Private Medical College Management Association (KPMCMA). Meanwhile, amid objection from HCWs, district administrations like Ernakulam, Thiruvananthapuram and Thrissur have organized special free vaccination drives for HCWs in a few private hospitals in the district. “Government has instructed all district medical officers (DMOs) to set up a few separate free vaccination centres for HCWs in some private hospitalsHCWs will get it for free,” said Dr Jayakrishnan AV, chairman, IMA committee for vaccination promotion and coordination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/health-staff-to-pay-for-vaccination-at-pvt-hosps/articleshow/81593957.cms||Preetu Nair

Kalla was replying to the supplementary questions during Question Hour. He informed that more than 13.49 lakh candidates had applied for the patwari examination. In such a big examination, there should not be the possibility of paper leak. So the examination was cancelled on administrative grounds to make foolproof arrangements, he said. He said a committee was formed by the state government on January 4, 2021 to prevent incidents of paper leak. The committee comprises IG (SOG) and secretary of RPSC. The committee has also studied the recruitment procedures in other states. Keeping this in view, the chief minister has announced the second phase of examinations in the budget as well. As per the new procedure, the first preliminary examination followed by the main examination with 12 or 15 times candidates invited against the number of posts, he said. Kalla said a law has also been made with a provision of seven years' punishment to the culprits found involved paper leak. Paper leak is a serious crime. The people involved in such crimes should be given stringent punishment. On December 6, 2020, the paper of Junior Engineer Civil Degree Joint Direct Recruitment Examination 2020 was leaked. The examination was cancelled which will be held again in June, he said.

---||Goa||Margao sees headhunting for ‘reserved’ names||MARGAO: Frantic headhunting exercise is under way in the camps of all the major political parties to replace the candidates affected by the new reservations for the Margao Municipal Council (MMC). The new reservations have dealt a setback to some of the key players for the elections to the MMC. Political observers are keeping a close watch on the moves of Margao MLA Digambar Kamat who was planning to launch his son Yogiraj into politics with a debut contest in the Margao municipality elections, before his plans were scuttled as ward 18 was reserved for OBC as per the original notification. But, the new notification has excluded ward 18 from any reservation. However, sources in the Kamat camp said that no decision has been taken about Yogiraj’s debut. Plans are also afoot in the Kamat camp of fielding the affected candidates from other wards, though the proposition has been met with some hesitation by the party managers considering the not-so-favorable situation for the candidates in the alternative wards. Disappointment is palpable in BJP camp as its outgoing councillor Rupesh Mahatme may be forced to abstain from contesting as his ward 17 has now been reserved for OBC. Hunting for a formidable OBC candidate from this ward is also turning out to be an arduous task for BJP, sources said. BJP faces a similar situation in ward 13 where its outgoing councillor Ketan Kurtarkar has been left out of contention as the ward has now been reserved for women. BJP and Congress are now headhunting for female candidates to fit the bill. In other affected wards, former councillors who were to contest, are now considering fielding their kin as replacements, sources said. GFP also faces a similar situation in several wards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/margao-sees-headhunting-for-reserved-names/articleshow/81595184.cms||Govind Kamat Maad
---||Nagpur||Hawkers, autorickshaw drivers to launch stir if lockdown is extended||Nagpur: District guardian minister Nitin Raut told TOI that a review meeting will be convened on Saturday on whether or not to extend the weeklong lockdown. Raut, who is in Mumbai, expressed concern over the spike in coronavirus cases in the city. On Thursday, municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B too had stated that Raut would convene a meeting over the issue. The civic administration hinted that with a spike in Covid-19 cases, they favoured extension of the weeklong lockdown till March 29 due to Holi. They also hinted that if extended, the lockdown will be much stricter. A police source said that the top brass has decided to recommend extension of restrictions till March 29 which will cover Holi to ensure the festival of colours does not trigger the avoidable mingling and chaos on the streets which may undo the efforts undertaken since March 15. With the restrictions lifted, police feel that allowing citizens to enjoy Holi may boomerang and hence it is gearing up to support the theory of retaining the curbs. Roadside hawkers and autorickshaw drivers from Hingna have threatened to resort to an indefinite hunger strike if the administration extended the weeklong lockdown. “If government wants to extend the lockdown then it should first provide financial assistance to roadside hawkers and autorickshaw drivers,” said Prem Kumar of Autorickshaw Chalak Malak Sangh (Hingna road). He said as many 300 autorickshaw drivers and a similar number of hawkers will stage an indefinite agitation at Lokmanya Nagar Metro Station, near Hingna T-point. A meeting in this regard was held on Friday evening and it was unanimously decided by the members to participate in the hunger strike. The pandemic, and the subsequent lockdown, has severely impacted the livelihood of autorickshaw drivers, hawkers and daily wagers. “Not only our livelihood in terms of daily earnings disappeared, but we also could not service the bank loan or any other private loans leading to financial distress. Even after the phase-wise lifting of lockdown, regular users did not feel comfortable to return to their usual travel on account of keeping a safe distance. Sharing rides with other passengers is a thing of the past now,” pointed out Kumar. Several autorickshaw owners even paid rent for parking their vehicles during the lockdown. Most of them are facing hardships in repaying their loans. Although a moratorium for loan repayments was declared till September 2020, now all financial institutions are issuing threats of proceeding with legal action if the loan is not repaid. The situation is no different for hawkers or those who run roadside tea kiosks. Santosh Chavan and Manoj Chowdhary, both hawkers on Hingna road, slammed the civic administration and district guardian minister for not giving a thought to the livelihood of such people while imposing the weeklong lockdown. “If the lockdown is extended even for a week then we will die due to starvation,” said Chavan. “We have decided to fight for our community,” said Chowdhary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hawkers-autorickshaw-drivers-to-launch-stir-if-lockdown-is-extended/articleshow/81593956.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Kolkata||KMC focuses on high-rises in Cov zones||Kolkata: Alarmed by the rising graph of Covid-19 cases in Kolkata, KMC board of administrators chairman Firhad Hakim on Friday lined out renewed measures by the civic body to control the spread of infection in the city. The KMC has started sending medical teams to Alipore, Bhowanipore and Burrabazar, three localities that have recorded a sharp rise in Covid count in recent days. According to Hakim, the number of fresh cases in the city has shot up from 30 a day to 150 a day on Friday, triggering alarm in the medical fraternity. KMC health officials said they were particularly concerned about the rising Covid graph in high-rises and markets. “In the first phase, too, the spread of the virus took a turn for the worse in high-rises and market complexes. After a lull, the virus is again becoming active in housing complexes and crowded market places. It is time to take note of the impending danger and act promptly,” the KMC health official said. “We have again activated the door-to-door campaign in the affected zones and will scale up testing facilities at the ward and borough level,” said a health department official. Hakim said the civic body would strengthen its sanitization drive across the city and utilize the sanitization vehicles to sanitize offices, schools and housing complexes.  “We have decided to fight it tooth and nail, and seek the cooperation of citizens,” said Firhad Hakim, appealing to citizens to wear masks and maintain distance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmc-focuses-on-high-rises-in-cov-zones/articleshow/81593958.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Delhi||A reserved lane for emergency vehicles? Policy decision, says HC||New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Friday asked authorities to treat as representation a plea seeking a reserved lane for unrestricted movement of emergency vehicles round the clock. A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and justice Jasmeet Singh said a policy decision is required in this matter and the court does not see any reason to issue a direction to the authorities. “It all depends on the width of a road and the traffic. We direct the respondents to treat the petition as a representation and decide it in accordance with rules, law and policy applicable in the facts of the case,” the bench said and disposed of the plea seeking a direction to Delhi government’s transport department and Delhi Police to provide a dedicated reserved lane for unrestricted use of emergency services 24x7. The petition also sought a direction to Delhi Police to ensure immediate compliance, implementation and enforcement of the law and issue direction to Delhi Disaster Management Authority to provide the requisite support, framework and infrastructure and resources for implementation of the dedicated reserved lanes. It argued that in case of any emergency, people will have the benefit of reaching the hospitals quickly if dedicate lanes are provided by the government. The plea also said that as per a report, Delhi has 56% traffic congestion, while 190 hours are lost in traffic congestion on an average.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/a-reserved-lane-for-emergency-vehicles-policy-decision-says-hc/articleshow/81595196.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The awards celebrate educationists and institutions in higher education who/which are building, enabling and embracing best digital practices for the future of education. On the occasion, Sisodia said, “Educational institutions should strive to ensure that students keep on learning new skills and technologies.” The awards also launched a compendium of top 25 universities and formal education institutions in India that are designing, enabling and innovating the future of education with best practices in learning, assessments, employability, teacher enablement and future readiness for the next generation of education institutions. Sisodia further said that “achieving excellence in a job is not innovation. Thinking out of the box is innovation. The problem with our education system is that only 5% children are able to attain quality education while 95% of our children are left behind. More problematic is that even the 5% of students are unable to innovate or contribute excellent research.” “Research needs time and resources but our leadership lacks the right approach. We need to redirect our focus to strengthen research activities and I think the only way we can do that is through correct leadership. Our government is keen to have research in our institutions through matching grants and encouragement. We want to inspire innovations in Delhi,” said the deputy CM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sisodia-honours-professors-with-new-code-education-awards/articleshow/81595188.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||‘Will move pvt member’s bill on Lokayukta’||Panaji: Leader of opposition Digambar Kamat said he will introduce the Goa Lokayukta Bill 2021 as a private member’s bill in the coming assembly session in order to give more powers to the Lokayukta. Kamat said that the BJP should prove its zero tolerance to corruption claim by passing the bill in the coming assembly session that begins from March 24. Kamat informed the secretariat on Thursday of his intention to introduce the bill in the House. “As Pramod Sawant steps in the third year as the chief minister of Goa, I am gifting “Goa Lokayukta Bill 2021” to the government of Goa, which will empower the Goa Lokayukta with dignity and authority to eradicate corruption and stop Illegalities. Hope the BJP government will pass the bill in coming assembly session,” said Kamat. On January 28, the Goa Legislative Assembly passed an amendment to the Goa Lokayukta Act after ignoring the opposition’s criticism that the amendment had diluted the powers of the Lokayukta. The Goa Lokayukta (Amendment) Act, 2021 not only changed the qualification for the post of Lokayukta, but also curtailed the statutory powers of the Lokayukta. The BJP-led government amended the Lokayukta Act and diluted the powers of the Lokayukta after Justice P K Misra, the former Goa Lokayukta, passed 16 adverse orders against the BJP-led government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/will-move-pvt-members-bill-on-lokayukta/articleshow/81595191.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa sees 100 new cases for 2nd time in a month||PANAJI: The sharp rise in Covid-19 cases in Goa continued as the state hit 100 fresh cases on Friday, the second time in a month. The active tally, which was recently around the 500-mark, rose to 898. “We have taken a month to touch 100, and it will take 15 days to touch 200,” said a GMC doctor. “The pace of infection will be faster unless the government and health authorities take measures to check transmission.” If Goa does not want a repeat of what it went through after cases started rising from June onwards last year, harsh measures are the only way forward, he said. The state’s vaccine drive, too, has not been going ahead at full steam. After two days of good response to the mega drive this week, enthusiasm tapered off by half on the third day. Institutional quarantine should be implemented to keep people who are likely to defy restriction under watch, or if not possible, tabs must be kept on people under home isolation. “It is high time the government initiates measures to stop mass gatherings, especially with Holi happening in a week,” he said.  While on Wednesday, CM Pramod Sawant declared the state would increase testing, as of Friday, the directorate of health services had no concrete plan to expand testing. The GMC doctor said that Panaji and Margao are spearheading the spike, with cases also rising in Ponda, Mapusa, Vasco, Porvorim and Cansaulim. “It is loud and clear the virus is spreading, and who is the culprit,” a top doctor said. “Visit any public place — whether a market or any other place of mass gathering — and nobody follows any norms. People wear masks below the chin. Even political leaders are not seen showing Covid appropriate behavior, and thus infections are bound to increase unless measures are taken.” He said that lockdowns and closures are not the solution. “It was necessary when we were not prepared to handle the situation last year, when we did not have the infrastructure ready. But it is not the case now. Our focus should be on containing the spread,” he said. The caseloads of Margao and Panaji has ranged between 90 to 110 cases for the last few days. The doctor said that DHS is currently focussing on the vaccination programme, and that its manpower and infrastructure have been invested in inoculating people at the earliest. However, the speed at which it is happening will take several months to complete vaccinating the target population, he said. Goa has had a steady rise in infections since March 3, but with the sharp spikes in neighbouring states and no controls at entry points, infection is likely to spread faster, experts say. “Presently, the only people who are monitored are those who are hospitalized,” a GMC doctor said. “There is a possibility that the contacts of people who tested positive or those who are in home isolation are flouting the norms because vaccinating is underway, and it is not possible to scrupulously monitor patients that are supposedly in isolation.” On Friday, Goa’s death toll rose to 815, with two deaths reported. A 73-year-old man from Bicholim and a 73-year-old woman from Margao succumbed to the virus at Goa Medical College.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-sees-100-new-cases-for-2nd-time-in-a-month/articleshow/81595363.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Tolly’s Nullah to come under Namami Gange||Kolkata: The Centre has sanctioned the proposal to restore Tolly’s Nullah, also called Adi Ganga, under the Namami Gange programme that involves pollution abatement projects to stop sewage from flowing into the canal. KMC board of administrators chairman Firhad Hakim on Friday said the civic body would start work immediately. “We will set up 12 sewage treatment plants along the entire stretch of Tolly’s Nullah to stop waste from flowing into the canal,” he said. Half a decade ago, KMC had taken up a project to restore the channel. That project, too, was funded by the Centre under the Ganga Action Programme. KMC, as the nodal agency, had started dredging along some stretches of the 16-km-long channel. However, the work on sewage treatment plants could not be taken up due to funds crunch. Construction of pillars during the north-south Metro extension had also affected dredging. The project suffered due to non-cooperation by a section of traders and residents. Garbage and plastic waste were also dumped at will. “We need to set an example by imposing penalty on errant individuals or businesses,“ said Debabrata Majumdar, a member in KMC board.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tollys-nullah-to-come-under-namami-gange/articleshow/81593997.cms||Saikat Ray

---||Kochi||Mid-air crash averted in Kochi in Aug: Report||Kochi: On August 28, exactly three weeks after the Air India Express crash at Karipur that claimed 18 lives, another major air tragedy could have occurred over Kochi airport as two aircraft were involved in an ‘Airprox’ when they escaped a mid-air collision by mere 30 seconds and 500ft vertical distance while approaching the runway for landing. Besides luck, the timely intervention of the air traffic controller (ATC) at Cochin International Airport Ltd (Cial) that discontinued the approach for SpiceJet and Qatar Airways and quick adherence to the advisories given by Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) averted the mid-air crash. At that time, the minimum lateral separation and vertical separations between the two aircraft were 2.39 nautical miles (around 4.43km) and 500ft respectively. An Airprox is a situation in which the distance between aircraft as well as their relative positions and speed, have been such that the safety of the aircraft involved may have been compromised. The two aircraft involved in the incident were SpiceJet Bombardier (SEJ7077) from Bengaluru to Kochi and Qatar Airways Airbus A-320 (QTR7477) from Doha to Kochi, both scheduled to land at Cial within a gap of a few minutes around 4.15pm.Though the incident went unreported, a probe was conducted by Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), the division of ministry of civil aviation that probes aircraft accidents and serious air incidents. AAIB investigation report, published on last Monday and accessed by TOI, stated it was a serious incident. Investigators Kunj Lata and Amit Kumar found that non-adherence to ATC instructions by the crew of SpiceJet and pilot’s failure to engage altitude pre-select mode (ALT-SEL) were probable cause for the incident. The incident happened when SpiceJet, followed by QA flight, were approaching Runway 27 for landing. When SpiceJet was descending to 3,000ft (final approach altitude), QA flight was given a descent of 4,000ft. As the pilot did not engage ‘ALT SEL’, SpiceJet descended below 3000 ft, which is dangerous due to the high terrain in the area. When ATC alerted the crew, instead of discontinuing the approach, it initiated a go-around at 2,281ft. But due to the increase in power, the aircraft climbed over the desired level. ATC asked QA flight to stop descent at 4,500ft to avoid conflict and asked SpiceJet to stop climb at 3,700ft. But it continued to climb and TCAS was triggered at 4,000ft. Due to the missed-approach path of SpiceJet, the aircraft came opposite to QA flight, hinting at probable mid-air collision. ATC instructed QA flight to climb to 6,000, ft and directed SpiceJet to descent thus ending the conflict. Both later landed safely. The report asked SpiceJet to impart suitable training to the flight crew involved in the incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/mid-air-crash-averted-in-kochi-in-aug-report/articleshow/81593973.cms||Anantha Narayanan K

Voting will be held for six municipalities — Bicholim, Pernem, Valpoi, Cuncolim, Curchorem and Canacona — and the Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP). Bypolls to 22 wards of different village panchayats and the ZP Navelim constituency will also be held. Of the 423 candidates in the fray, 95 are contesting for the 30 CCP wards. Polling officers have already left for their respective booths with ballot papers. Voting will be held from 8am to 5pm. “We expect people to finish their voting by 4pm, and 4pm to 5pm has been kept for Covid patients,” SEC secretary Melvyn Vaz. An officer said that the standard operating procedure for Covid will be followed. This will be the second civic polls being held during the pandemic. The zilla panchayat election was held in December 2020 for which the electorate was 7.9 lakh. The officer said that the Block Level Officers (BLOs) have been given PPE kits to distribute to Covid patients who want to come for voting. Over 850 active cases are reported across the state. BLOs were asked to identify these patients in their respective booths so that arrangements could be put in place for them to cast their vote. Counting of votes will be done on March 22. Opposition parties have, however, been demanding that counting be held along with the five municipalities whose elections have been deferred due to reservation of wards. SEC is yet to announce the date for the election of five other municipal councils namely Margao, Mormugao,Mapusa, Quepem and Sanguem. Political observers said that these polls are crucial for political parties as it will help them gauge the mood of the urban population in view of the assembly polls.

Even as former chief minister Oommen Chandy reiterated on Friday that Sabarimala was not a political weapon for UDF, the senior Congress leader wanted to put the rival CPM on the defensive following the confusion among the CPM top ranks on their stance on the issue. Chandy played up the Sabarimala issue on Friday, a day after the NSS came out strongly against the CPM leadership, asking them to make their stand clear. Chandy said UDF’s stand on the issue has remained the same since the beginning. He said customs and traditions have to be protected and if needed a new law has to be made for the same. “UDF is firm on protecting the faith and traditions of devotees and the affidavit filed by the UDF government in 2016 makes our stand clear,” he said. “However, the LDF governments led by V S Achutanandan and Pinarayi Vijayan took a stand to allow entry of women in Sabarimala. UDF fought legally against this in the high court and Supreme Court. Had the LDF government endorsed the stand of the UDF government, the verdict would have been different,” he said. He also said though the UDF government had filed an affidavit protecting the rights of devotees just ahead of election in 2016, they never used it for political mileage. Chandy blamed devaswom minister Kadakampally Surendran for bringing the issue to the fore again. “The issue resurfaced after the genuineness of the apology tendered by Surendran on the action of LDF government on Sabarimala issue was questioned,” he said. On the CM’s statement that talks will be held with all before implementing the final verdict from the Supreme Court, Chandy said, it lacked sincerity. “When Pinarayi says this, he is keeping mum on the affidavit. If he is sincere, he should speak about the status of the affidavit as well,” he said. Chandy also listed out the major developments in Sabarimala during the UDF regime. “The UDF government could acquire around 12.67 hectares of forest area, which was part of Periyar Tiger Reserve, for widening the road from Pamba to Sannidhanam. Another 110 hectares of forest land was acquired for the development of base camp at Nilackal too,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/udf-not-keen-on-playingsabarimala-card-chandy/articleshow/81593995.cms||Jaikrishnan Nair

SP district president Yogesh Chandra Yadav said, “People of the state are fed up with the BJP government. The progress of the state has been stalled in the past four years and all the sections of the society, including students, youths, farmers and traders, are feeling cheated.” He also claimed that BJP’s slogan “sakba saath, sabka vikas” has proved to be a flop show. Yadav also lamented that the graph of crime against women has increased manifold in the four years of the BJP government, which had been giving slogans like “Beti Bachao Beti Padhao”. SP leaders claimed that the BJP government was intentionally lodging fake FIRs against Samajwadi Party leaders, which would not be tolerated. They said that people of the state would give a befitting reply to the BJP government in the 2022 assembly polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/samajwadi-activists-held-for-protesting-on-yogi-govts-4th-anniv/articleshow/81593100.cms||---

Karnataka officials stopped vehicles on Friday at the Thalappady interstate border and conducted inspections in all inbound vehicles asked for RT-PCR certificates. Though the officials allowed passengers without test reports entry to the state, they said that they would insist on negative RT- PCR certificates from Saturday onwards. The checks were conducted by health department and police officers from 7am to 9am and even KSRTC and private buses were stopped for inspections. Karnataka chief minister B S Yediyurappa had said three days ago that the government decided to enhance checks for RT-PCR-negative test reports at the border checkposts between Kerala and Karnataka following a surge in Covid-19 cases. He had said that all deputy commissioners have been instructed to enhance the directive. Karnataka had made it mandatory for travellers from Kerala to produce negative test certificates last month itself, but following public protests in Kasaragod they had relaxed the checks. Also, Dakshina Kannada deputy commissioner had issued orders on February 22 to shut 13 interior roads that connect Kerala to Kasaragod and had imposed severe restrictions on four other routes citing the spread of Covid-19. Karnataka high court is hearing a petition filed by Congress leader B Subbayya Rai from Kasaragod challenging the interstate road blockade and travel restrictions. The high court had criticized the state government for imposing travel restrictions in violation of the central government’s unlock guidelines during the course of hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ktaka-makes-ve-rt-pcr-test-report-mandatory/articleshow/81594180.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

While TRS candidate Palla Rajeshwar Reddy got 1,11,090 votes, Mallanna secured 83,520 votes in the first preference votes and emerged as nearest rival in the constituency. TJS candidate Kodandaram, BJP candidate G Premender Reddy and Congress candidate Ramulu Naik were confined to third, fourth and fifth places. In Hyderabad-Rangareddy-Mahbubnagar (HRM) constituency, independent candidate and former MLC K Nageshwar is in the third place. TRS candidate Surabhi Vani Devi is leading with over 8,050 votes by securing 1,12,727 votes against BJP candidate N Ramchander Rao, who secured 1,04,685 votes.  Nageshwar Rao managed to get 53,628 votes and Congress candidate and former minister Chinna Reddy was confined to fourth place with over 31,000 votes. Some independents like Harshavardhan Reddy, who quit the Congress party and contested as an independent, dent the votes of Chinna Reddy drastically. Nageshwar represented the HRM between 2007 to 2014. In 2009 MLC elections, he defeated major political parties’ candidates as he enjoys the support from trade unions, unemployed youth and even some employees’ organisations. “In 2009 election, the TRS did not contest the election due to strategic reasons as it did not have strong base especially in Hyderabad. Even TRS indirectly supported him in that election. This time, TRS fielded its candidate, and there has been a split in the votes due to large number of contestants,” a senior TRS leader observed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/teenmar-show-mallanna-dances-up-a-vote-storm/articleshow/81595253.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Kolkata||Cov lifestyle change leaves city sleepless||Kolkata: Lockdown and the lifestyle changes triggered by it have contributed to the growing number of people suffering from obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), according to experts who attended a seminar on ‘Sleepless Night – Help @ Hand’ at a city private hospital on Friday. Longer hours on the computer, extended screen time on account of work-from-home and OTT and lack of exercise have resulted in reduced and disturbed sleep which can be corrected through a proper ‘sleep hygiene’, said the experts. “One out of every 10 suffer from a sleep-related disorder in urban areas. Around 5% suffer from OSA which happens when the oxygen supply is cut off during sleep. OSA is the most important of sleeping disorders and it can be treated most effectively by developing a proper sleeping cycle. While drugs can help, they can’t cure you unless you have regular sleeping hours,” said Raja Dhar, pulmonologist at CMRI Hospital where the seminar was held. Hitting the bed at a particular time every night is a key element of sleep hygiene, added Dhar. “One should stop drinking tea or coffee at least 3-4 hours before going to bed and switch off all gadgets. You should stop thinking of work and relax. It’s also important to ensure that you get adequate physical exercise so that your body muscles tire making it easier for you to fall asleep,” said Dhar. Those suffering from OSA are more prone to heart attacks and strokes, according to Arjun Dasgupta of the department of ENT at CMRI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cov-lifestyle-change-leaves-city-sleepless/articleshow/81594064.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

ED had called Sarnaik for questioning on Wednesday and Thursday in a money laundering case. While replying to the summons on Thursday, Sarnaik sent a letter to ED stating a doctor had advised him rest for a month. Last year, ED had questioned Sarnaik, who had appeared before the agency after he had procured protection against coercive action from the Supreme Court. The court also granted relief to his son Vihang and his brother-in-law Yogesh Chandegala. ED sources said they wanted to question Sarnaik and his son again about collected evidence but they were avoiding the summons. On November 24, ED had raided Sarnaik’s premises along with offices of Tops Grup and its chairman Rahul Nanda after registering a money laundering case. Meanwhile, ED recorded the statement of B G Pawar, joint metropolitan commissioner, MMRDA, earlier this week. ED officials found an audio-recording between Sarnaik’s alleged associate Amit Chandole and Tops Grup senior executive M Shashidharan where they allegedly referred to bribing Pawar. In his statement to ED, Pawar rubbished the alleged recording. He told ED in MMRDA everyone knew Chandole was Sarnaik’s close associate. Ramesh Iyer, former director of Tops Grup, had told ED Sarnaik helped Tops Grup get an MMRDA contract to supply security at foot over bridges in 2014.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaisarnaik-seeks-a-mth-to-appear-before-ed-cites-health-reasons/articleshow/81594065.cms||Vijay V Singh

Fatalities increased six times in the district in the 19 days of March. After recording new highs for three consecutive days, the district registered 3,235 positive cases on Friday, 561 less compared to the 3,796 recorded a day ago. Cases declined despite 16,066 tests on Friday, the figure was 16,139 on Thursday. After probably being the first among all the cities in the country for two consecutive days, the city (2,617) was third after Mumbai (3,063) and Pune (2,872) on Friday after a decline in positive cases. As per the data of the state’s public health department (PHD), active cases in the district surged to 25,861 and continued to be second highest among all the districts in the country after Pune (37,384). Deaths have started to surge in the district. On March 1, the district saw six deaths. The 35 deaths in the district (city 23, rural 9 and other districts 3) on Friday is almost a six-fold rise in 19 days of March. It was also the highest in a day in the second wave which is going on in the district from the third week of February. The number was highest after 36 deaths (city 29, rural 4 and other districts 3) were recorded on October 1 last year. On Friday, TOI had reported a four-fold rise in cases in 18 days of March. It clearly indicates that fatalities are on the rise. It took 12 days for the district to witness the doubling of deaths. On March 12, 15 fatalities were registered. the latest doubling happened in one week which is a major worry for the district. As per the data of PHD, deaths in the district were 5. Fatalities in Mumbai district, including Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation, were 10 and six in Pune district, including Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation. The single day cases on four days between March 16 and 19 were higher compared to the days in September which was the peak of the first wave. In terms of deaths, the number is less in March. The district had witnessed 64 deaths (City 51, rural 9 and other districts 4) on September 17, 2020. The deaths were above 50 in a day on 15 days in September last year. The increase in deaths in March despite early detection of cases is worrisome for the district. The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and Zilla Parishad (ZP) are managing over 16,000 tests per day which were below 8,000 per day in September. “Deaths have started to increase. Cases are very high. People above 60, especially with comorbidities, are vulnerable to the disease and majority of the deceased are from this age group. Therefore, early detection and treatment is a must to control deaths,” municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B told TOI. The civic chief added that vaccination of all senior citizens will definitely help in controlling deaths. “We started inoculation for the age-appropriate group from March 1. We are putting in a lot effort to cover as many people as possible. Eligible people should come forward and take the jab at the earliest. Sufficient antibodies developed after the vaccine will help in preventing severe infection and deaths,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/at-35-nagpur-district-records-highest-daily-covid-toll-in-169-days/articleshow/81595053.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Hyderabad||MLC polls: Fitment, opposition vote split game changers for TRS||HYDERABAD: The TRS had little hopes of wresting the Hyderabad-Rangareddy-Mahbubnagar graduates MLC seat held by BJP candidate N Ramchander Rao and was searching for a suitable candidate days before the nomination process was to end. Similarly, in the sitting seat of Warangal-Khammam-Nalgonda held by chief minister K Chandrashekar Rao’s close aide Palla Rajeshwar Reddy, the TRS was facing a tough time. But, what has changed since then? The TRS is now sitting pretty in both the constituencies and is hoping to win both the seats on Saturday. Key factors that may have contributed to the TRS’s lead position include the CM’s promise of 29% fitment as claimed by the employees’ unions, KCR’s masterstroke of fielding former PM PV Narasimha Rao’s daughter Surabhi Vani Devi from HRM seat, CM himself strategising the polls, TRS working president KT Rama Rao’s vigorous campaigning, division of votes among opposition parties and huge enrolment by the party. Though the state government employees and graduates were unhappy with the government, a meeting was held with the employees’ unions three days before the polling on March 14. Steps like the new Pay Revision Commission, 29% fitment promise, hike in retirement age up to 61 and issuing of job vacancy notifications to fill 50,000 posts may have clinched the issue in favour of the TRS, analysts said. Independent candidate professor K Nageshwar, who is in the fray from HRM seat, told TOI, “Employees feared that if TRS is not voted, they will get only 7.5% fitment instead of 29% as promised. The TRS succeeded in creating fear among the employees.” Professor M Kodandaram of Telangana Jana Samithi, who is testing his luck from WKN seat, said: “Fitment’s likely announcement has helped the TRS.” Congress spokesperson Dasoju Sravan said KCR and KTR worked hard. Adding that ‘other factors’ also played a role, he said, “It is a moral defeat for TRS”. Privatisation of PSUs, Centre’s policies and dissent among central government employees went against the BJP. Also, Brahmin vote division between Ramchander and Vani Devi and the saffron party’s lack of support among employees’ unions have also affected the party’s chances, analysts said. BJP candidate G Premender Reddy, who contested in WKN, said: “We entered the fray late.” He said PRC bait made a difference. TRS leader Karne Prabhakar said, “Opposition is making baseless allegations. For better employment and better life, employees voted for us.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/fitment-kcrs-strategy-vote-division-among-oppn-help-trs-race-ahead-in-mlc-polls/articleshow/81595234.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

Incumbent LG Anil Baijal, who was vice-chairman of Delhi Development Authority at the time, was present with Kapoor when the foundation of the Yamuna Biodiversity Park was heralded by the planting of silk cotton tree saplings. Today, the Yamuna Biodiversity Park is flourishing over 457 acres and is home to forest communities, biologically rich wetlands, grassland communities, fruit yielding species and medicinal herbs, apart from native flora and fauna that had vanished. This transformed area will be showcased at the London Design Biennale 2021 for its landscape design. In the last two decades, DDA has developed six other biodiversity parks in the capital and on Friday, the LG released Biodiversity Parks: Nature Reserves of Delhi, an e-book mapping this long but successful journey. In 2001, it was at a conference on environment that professor C. R. Babu, then the pro vice-chancellor of Delhi University and director of Centre for Environmental Management of Degraded Ecosystems, apprised Kapoor about the rampant loss of native biodiversity of Delhi. It was this conversation, according to the e-book, that led to the concerned LG responding with the land for a biodiversity park. Twenty years hence, Babu is still steering the Biodiversity Parks Programme in collaboration with DDA. Baijal congratulated DDA and expressed his gratitude to the professor and his team. A DDA spokesperson said, “The book depicts the journey of country’s first initiative in bringing back the lost ecosystems of the city and pictorial guide for kinds of plants and animals and diverse ecosystems found in the biodiversity parks and also illustrates how scientists, engineers and landscape architects’ transformed barren landscapes in Delhi into lush green forest, grassland and wetland ecosystems.” The e-book is available on DDA’s website, www.dda.org.in, under the ‘Biodiversity Parks’ tab on the home page. The spokesperson said the Aravalli, Neela Hauz, Northern Ridge (Kamla Nehru Biodiversity Park), Tilpath Valley, Tughlaqabad and Kalindi Biodiversity Parks had become repositories of locally threatened flora and fauna assembled in the form of natural ecosystems. “These ecosystems are not only excellent CO2 sinks and store enormous carbon stocks, but they also recharge groundwater, purify sewage water through constructed wetland ecosystems and are sources of enrichment of human micro-biome,” he said, adding that these have been rendering a wide range of ecological services to the city and its citizens while promoting environmental and nature conservation education among students and public.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/such-a-long-journey-how-7-tracts-of-degraded-land-were-transformed-into-biodiversity-parks/articleshow/81595282.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Nagpur||No buyers due to lockdown curbs, farmers dump veggies, give it free||NAGPUR: “Never bite the hand that feeds you” goes the saying but it is illustrated by the plight of farmers especially during the weeklong lockdown. A farmer from Mohpa village in Katol tehsil distributed several crates of tomato free as he could not sell his produce following the Covid-induced lockdown in Nagpur district. Prashant Thakre, another farmer made a video of him distributing tomatoes free of cost to the citizens in Katol town. Suresh Bhujade, a farmer from Linga village in Kalmeshwar tehsil, dumped a heap of coriander bundles on the roadside jungle. He left a video message before dumping the produce explaining the plight of farmers like him. These are among the hundreds of farmers from Nagpur district, who are facing challenges of harvesting, taking produce to agriculture markets and getting agricultural labour due to ongoing weeklong lockdown imposed from March 15 to 21. They suffer even as authorities claim to be addressing their concerns. District guardian minister Nitin Raut said he was not aware of this and has appealed to the farming community not to take such a step and assured to look into their matter. To a query, Raut admitted that no such thought was given to the issue during the imposition of weeklong lockdown but henceforth it will be considered. Ram Mahajan, secretary, Mahatma Phule Sabji va Fal Adatiya Association, Cotton Market, too admitted that the 1pm diktat has forced the retail vegetable vendors to buy less. “So the demand for vegetables in the wholesale market too has come down manifold,” he said. Bhujade expressed his displeasure over the elected representatives not appearing in the constituency during the ongoing crisis and took stock of the situation and people’s problem first-hand. According to him, he loaded at least 320kg of coriander in a mini-van and took it to Cotton Market. But due to lockdown restrictions of 1pm, he could not find any buyers. “I also tried to sell the produce for a paltry Rs 2 per kg, but none of the wholesale buyers were keen to buy. I even offered to give it free after finding no buyers,” he claimed. Later, he dumped the entire produce on Kalmeshwar road while returning to his hometown. Farmers told TOI that the restriction on movement during the lockdown had left a negative impact on them to transport their produce in wholesale vegetable markets in Nagpur city and other tehsil places. “However, the 1pm restrictions for shops of all essential commodities including vegetable vendors was like rubbing salt to our injuries,” said Thakre. Thakre said he has ripening watermelon and vegetables at his agriculture field in Pawandri-Susandri in Katol tehsil and with 1pm diktat wholesale buyers in both Agriculture Produce Market Corporation in Kalamna and Cotton Market have restricted buying of vegetables and fruits. With no alternative, Thakre too dumped his produce in his field. Similar instances are being reported from Kalmeshwar, Katol, Umred and in interiors in the district where farmers were either dumping crates of unsold produce on roadside or giving it free of cost. Farming activities have almost come to a standstill in most of the places in the district. Roshan Panchbhai, a farmer from Lingi village, told TOI that they are unable to reach the market to sell their produce which is leading to a spike in vegetable prices. He informed that some farmers like him who are unable to sell perishable crops are donating them to cowsheds where they can be consumed by cattle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-buyers-due-to-lockdown-curbs-farmers-dump-veggies-give-it-free/articleshow/81594072.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

---||Hyderabad||BJP campaign runs into TRS speed bump||HYDERABAD: Going by the results in the two gradudates MLC polls counting, the BJP’s aggressive ground work much ahead of the elections does not seem to have yielded a good result. With party candidate G Premender Reddy trailing at fourth place in Warangal-Khammam-Nalgonda seat, the party’s plans to counter the TRS government may remain passive for some time. Another let down is the way sitting MLC N Ramchander Rao is faring in Hyderabad-Rangareddy-Mahbubnagar seat. Ramchander whose win was touted to be a cakewalk is facing an uphill task to secure lead. The BJP went all out against CM K Chandrasekhar Rao and TRS working president KTR on issues like ITIR and jobless allowance. Results on Saturday could push the party to drop its aggressive posturing against TRS before Nagarjunasagar bypoll. Another worry for BJP is that its candidate is trailing Independent T Mallanna in WKN seat in the first preference votes. In the last elections, the party candidate stood first in the first preference votes. This erosion share could derail its march towards 2023 assembly polls. “Though we dismissed Vani Devi’s candidature, she has done well, denting the community (Brahmin) votes,” a BJP leader said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bjp-campaign-runs-into-trs-speed-bump/articleshow/81595263.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Those, who do not take the vaccine, will lose out on the insurance and medical benefits,” a senior PMC official said, while citing an order in this regard. The official said even though vaccination was voluntary, it was expected that the civic staffers involved in Covid-related works get vaccinated against the infection. As per civic data, about 18,000 employees are working in the civic administration, including permanent staff members and contractual workers. Of them, about 6,000 have been vaccinated so far. The civic body has been offering an insurance of Rs 1 crore and free medical treatment to its staffers testing positive while discharging their duties. “The directives have been given for the health and safety of the employees and also in larger public interest,” said Rubal Agarwal, additional commissioner of PMC.

---||Hyderabad||Community outreach helps TRS garner votes||HYDERABAD: The Telangana Rashtra Samithi’s (TRS’s) strategy appears to have worked out in the MLC graduates constituency elections. The pink party adopted a multi-pronged strategy which included reaching out to every voter, holding meetings with various sections of society and appointing ministers and MLAs as in-charges. With community outreach being the key to its strategy, interactions were organised with caste and community leaders, professionals, graduates and government employees, for which TRS leaders from various districts were deployed. In vote counting, TRS candidates Surabhi Vani Devi from Hyderabad-Rangareddy-Mahbubnagar (HRM) and Palla Rajeshwar Reddy from Warangal-Khammam-Nalgonda (WKN) were leading going by the first preference votes and several rounds of second preference votes till Friday night. While Vani Devi was leading by 8,000 votes to the nearest rival BJP candidate Ramchander Rao, Rajeshwar Reddy was leading by over 29,000 votes against independent candidate Teenmar Mallanna. While WKN is sitting seat for TRS, HRM is sitting seat for BJP. TRS party sources said chief minister had personally monitored the election campaign especially HRM constituency on a day-to-day basis and even deputed senior minister T Harish Rao for Ranga Reddy, Gangula Kamalakar for Hyderabad and Vemula Prashant Reddy for Mahbubnagar to coordinate campaigning. The other ministers Niranjan Reddy, V Srinivas Goud, Srinivas Yadav and Mohd Mahmood Ali also toured in their respective districts and campaigned for party candidates. From organizational side, the party has 50,000 members in each assembly constituency and they were roped in campaigning to meet every voter. The workers were asked to meet every voter and tell how the state government was working for welfare of every section of society and schemes being implemented. TRS working president KT Rama Rao and other ministers also held meetings with caste organizations and members like Brahmins, professionals like lawyers, graduates, intellectuals, doctors and even government employees. Some employees’ unions openly extended their support to the TRS in both the constituencies. Other parties candidates too tried to reach every voter and sections of people, but seems to be failed to get expected result. “The TRS supremo sprung a surprise by choosing Vani Devi as candidate for HRM constituency, that too just two days before the last date for filing nominations. The opposition parties were under impression that the TRS may not field its candidate from HRM constituency. Second, TRS government which has been celebrating former PV Narsimha Rao’s birth centenary celebrations expected good support from voters,” a TRS senior leader said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/community-outreach-helps-trs-garner-votes/articleshow/81595272.cms||Koride Mahesh

The fate of 423 candidates who are left in the fray for the elections to municipalities and bypolls to panchayats and zilla panchayats, will be sealed on March 20. A candidate who is contesting the CCP election said that he is still meeting people to make sure he wins. Candidates are also circulating posters on WhatsApp, appealing to voters to vote for them. Sources said that some candidates are even going visiting houses of residents whose votes the candidate thinks are unsure. A candidate contesting the Bicholim municipal council election said that he wants to use all resources available to reach out to voters so that even if a single voter is left, they will be covered at the last minute. A political observer said that in municipal elections, every vote is counted. “Municipal wards comprise 800-1,200 voters, and there are a minimum of five candidates in each ward. In these circumstances, the winning margin is between 10-50 votes, and no candidate would like to take a chance by sitting at home and not reaching out,” he said. Sources said that it is not just candidates who are getting in touch with voters, but even MLAs who have fielded panels are phoning voters to appeal for their votes. In fact, candidates and their political bosses are working overnight since this is the last election before the state faces assembly polls. “Political parties are working hard to make sure that they win the confidence of urban voters,” the observer said He added that “Approaching voters last-minute can help the candidates and their bosses with votes, which can decide the results of the election”. The elections are also crucial because it would help BJP gauge the mood of the urban population before next year’s assembly polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/flurry-of-last-minute-activity-as-netas-go-the-extra-mile-to-woo-unsure-voters/articleshow/81595269.cms||Murari Shetye

In the FIR submitted on Friday to the judicial magistrate court in Kochi, the crime branch has invoked IPC Sections 116, 120-B, 167, 192, 193 and 195-A for conspiracy, intimidation and forcing to give false statements against the Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan. The crime branch had earlier conducted a preliminary inquiry, in which statements of 18 people, including that of Swapna Suresh, the key accused in the case related to gold smuggling through diplomatic channels, was recorded. TOI has learnt that a special team will be set up to probe the case. The state had received legal advice from the director general of prosecutions that a case should be registered against the ED sleuths who had interrogated Suresh in jail. The government had sought legal advice based on the report of the investigation team that had probed the leak of Suresh’s voice clip. Woman civil police officers Siji Vijayan and S Rejimol, who were allegedly on duty while the ED sleuths interrogated Suresh, had stated that the ED officers were compelling Swapna to give a statement against the chief minister. Vijayan had said the ED officers were asking questions to Suresh in Hindi and English, and since she understood both the languages, she could make out what they were asking. A voice clip allegedly of Suresh had circulated in which, she was heard saying that the ED sleuths offered to turn her approver if she gave a statement against the CM. She said the ED officers had not allowed her to go through her statements properly before signing it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/gold-smuggling-kerala-cops-cry-conspiracy-file-case-against-ed/articleshow/81597437.cms||---

Some of them also cited the recent upsurge in Covid-19 cases in the city and region and urged people to get vaccinated without fear as it is one of the first lines of defence against the pandemic. The MCCIA said the use of regional languages and short clips was to increase the circulation among people. “This format has been chosen so that our member companies can send these to their employees via platforms like WhatsApp. There is still a lot of vaccine hesitancy among people and communication in English only will create an echo chamber. That is why the clips are in Marathi and Hindi,” said Prashant Girbane, director-general of the MCCIA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mccia-launches-vax-awareness-drive-engages-industry-captains/articleshow/81594083.cms||---

With this, the active Covid cases in the district have shot up to 590. The day also saw 51 patients getting discharged from treatment centres.Officials attributed the increase in the daily count to a new cluster at Kurichi Housing Unit at Ramanathapuram, where the infection has gripped four of a family.

People in these areas are now more careful about handwashing and sanitizing.”Other high-risk areas in the city are Selvapuram, Saravanampatti, Vadavalli, Uppilipalayam, Kuniyamuthur, KK Pudur and Ramanathapuram.At 11, Somanur saw the highest number of Covid cases in the rural areas in the past 10 days, followed by NGGO Colony, where nine people tested positive for the virus during the period.Health department officials have asked primary health centres in the high-risk areas to increase the testing. “We were earlier testing 2,500 samples a day. We have asked them to increase it to 3,500 samples a day from Wednesday. The positivity rate has increased to 3.5% in the past one week,” the deputy director of public health said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/covid-10-high-risk-areas-identified-in-city/articleshow/81595308.cms||---

They also threatened the security guard of one of the societies with a sharp weapon. The burglars stole a television set and an air cooler from a flat as well as documents of a plot from another flat. “The remaining six flats were vacant,” said Nitin Salunke, investigating officer from the Hinjewadi police station. The burglaries happened at Marigold Avenue, Madhuvishwa, Mangesh Garden and Green Glory housing societies in Bavdhan. The TV and cooler, collectively worth Rs14,000, were stolen from a flat in Mangesh Garden society. The tenant in the flat was out of the city. Flat owner Ganesh Tangade (42) has lodged an FIR with the police. Ramlal Patel, security guard of the Marigold Avenue said, “Around 2am, I was patrolling the premises, when an unknown man scaled the compound wall, stood in front of me and threatened me with a sharp weapon.” Meanwhile, two more masked men scaled the compound wall, said Patel. A resident of the society said that when they had gone to the police station to report the incident, they found that seven more flats in Bavdhan were burgled. Another resident of Bavdhan said that the four masked men have been captured by CCTV cameras at a society. An officer from the Pimpri Chinchwad crime branch said that prima facie probe revealed that the burglars may be from nearby localities in Kothrud or Warje. “We are working on some clues,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/masked-men-swipe-valuables-from-8-flats-in-bavdhan/articleshow/81594108.cms||Mihir Tanksale

TOI on March 10 had reported 10 of 12 positive patients in home isolation were not given five types of medicines, including Favipiravir, by the RRT. In NMC’s records, the RRT visited homes of these patients, gave medicines and also checked temperature, oxygen saturation level and pulse rate. Mayor Dayashankar Tiwari, municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B and members of Urban Task Force were also present at the meeting. NMC additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi and chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar told TOI, “Majority of doctors present at the meeting suggested not to give the medicine to asymptomatic and mild symptomatic patients. Also, the state government never directed to prescribe this medicine to all patients,” they said. But the civic body itself claimed that it distributed Favipiravir to all patients in home isolation from September last year to till date. The state government had supplied 5,58,000 tablets of Favipiravir and 38,51,000 tablets of Calcium D-3 for distribution to positive patients in home isolation free of cost in September 2020. The NMC had procured 8 lakh tablets of Vitamin C, 7 lakh tablets of Zinc and 6 lakh tablets of B-complex. One box of 34 tablets of Favipiravir costs Rs1,292. The patients are supposed to get two boxes of Favipiravir along with other four medicines for 10 days of home isolation. The NMC sources told TOI, “No stock of Favipiravir is available with the NMC’s store room. Staffers claimed that they distributed over 5 lakh tablets to patients. Some stock is available with NMC’s hospitals and dispensaries. The government is yet to supply fresh stock. The NMC can procure this tablet but no decision taken in this regard at the meeting,” the sources said. The sources further said the NMC wants to streamline distribution of Favipiravir to prevent irregularities. “It becomes difficult to check whether RRT visited all homes and gave tablets. Therefore, the NMC kept option of giving Favipiravir to patients who demand for it with proper prescription from doctor. It will also help in preventing wastage and misuse of tablets by people. Many asymptomatic patients did not consume the medicine,” the sources said. The NMC will continue giving other five tablets to all patients in home isolation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-stops-prescribing-favipiravir-to-patients-in-home-isolation/articleshow/81594151.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Coimbatore||No toilets, no votes, say Anjaneyar Colony folk||Coimbatore: Residents of Anjaneyar Colony near Ondipudur in the city are planning to boycott the upcoming state assembly election and ban politicians from entering their locality, if they refuse to give a written assurance to construct at least a public toilet for them if elected to power. The residents have long been demanding the public representatives and government officials to construct public toilets, as they don’t find it safe to defecate in the open. While the city corporation was declared open defecation-free in January 2017, more than 50% of Anjaneyar Colony residents continue to defecate in the open. More than 250 families reside in the locality and none of them have household toilets. The area also lacks community toilets. V Chandru, a resident, said, “As our demand to construct public toilets in the locality hasn’t been met yet, we have decided to hold talks with all the candidates contesting from Singanallur constituency. Only if they provide a written assurance to fulfil our demand, we will allow them in our area for campaigning and cast our votes. If not, we will boycott the election.” Pointing out that they had been defecating on a nearby open site, which was filled with bushes, for years together, he said residents of that locality had recently cleared the bushes to end the open defecation in the area. “We have no other option. More than their opposition, what bothers us more is the women’s safety.”Another resident, K Deivanai, said four families were residing on 1.75 cents land and there was no space to construct a toilet. “Until recently, we were relieving ourselves behind bushes. Now that the bushes have been cleared, there is no cover for us. As there will be daily wage workers in the area after 6am, we go there to relieve ourselves very early in the morning. With people constantly moving around the site, we don’t feel safe. That’s why we have been requesting the government to construct at least a public toilet in our area, but to no avail.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/no-toilets-no-votes-say-anjaneyar-colony-folk/articleshow/81595286.cms||Nivedha Selvam

According to Bapusaheb Nagargoje, the medical superintendent of the NMC, only four NMC centres are still vaccinating the beneficiaries with Covaxin shots. NMC requires at least 5,000 Covishield doses each day, but the stock has now emptied. The civic body has some Covaxin stocks. Covaxin is being administered at four of the overall 27 centres — two at Bytco, and one each at Indira Gandhi hospital and Zakir Hussain hospital. NMC had received 75,700 Covishield and 15,260 Covaxin doses. All the Covishield doses have been used up, while Covaxin shots are being used in the vaccination centres of 13 private hospitals and four NMC centres. Nagargoje admitted the vaccination process has been affected in 23 vaccination centres due to Covishield stocks getting used up. “We have made a total demand of 1.5 lakh vaccines to the health department of the state government. The government has sent a fresh lot of 12,000 Covishield vaccines for the NMC. We are expected to receive the fresh batch of Covishield shortly,” said Nagargoje. “We have been administering Covaxin to around 300 beneficiaries per day since Thursday — down from 450 daily shots earlier. But we will increase the number once we get the fresh stock of Covishield,” said V Deokar, the in-charge of the vaccination centre at the NMC’s Indira Gandhi hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/23-nmc-centres-halt-vax-drive-as-covishield-stock-dries-up/articleshow/81592610.cms||Tushar Pawar

Though Chinna Reddy secured reasonable number of votes, he stood behind independent candidate Prof K Nageshwar in the race as per last reports. Candidate for the WKN seat Ramulu Naik was behind many independent candidates. The party has not tasted much success in the state in recent polls. Non-performance during the GHMC elections led to multiple debates within the party, but did not help it revive its fortunes. Party insiders say that more than losing to TRS, the biggest worry for the party now is that not been able to perform like main opposition in the elections. “We seem to have lost out on the race to BJP,” a top leader said. With leadership issues to be settled, their performance may be a warning sign ahead of Nagarjunasagar bypoll.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pushed-to-the-margins-in-mlc-polls-congress-stares-at-crisis/articleshow/81595321.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

They said Venkatachalam had violated the party rules and brought discredit to the AIADMK.Venkatachalam, two-time MLA from Perundurai constituency in Erode, had four days ago expressed his dissatisfaction over the party denying him a ticket to contest the upcoming assembly election. Since there was no response from the party high command, he filed nomination to contest as an independent from Perundurai seat itself.“It was because of the order given by Amma’s soul that I am contesting the election. I have Amma’s blessings and I will win the election,” Venkatachalam said. He said he did not want to blame chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami or deputy CM O Panneerselvam for expelling him from the party and charged two ministers from the district for his expulsion.Venkatachalam asked why he was denied a ticket to contest for third time, while education minister K A Sengottaiyan was given the chance to contest for the 11th time. He said the AIADMK’s official candidate S Jayakumar had rebelled against the party’s decision, but no action was taken against him. “This sort of favouritism does not augur well for the party and government.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/aiadmk-expells-venkatachalam/articleshow/81595338.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Tandur civic chief in spot over ‘bogus vote’||HYDERABAD: Tandur municipality chairperson Tatikonda Swapna Parimal has landed herself in a controvery over charges that she cast a bogus vote in Hyderabad-Rangareddy-Mahbubnagar graduates MLC election on March 14. The allegation against Swapna, who belongs to the ruling TRS, is that she wilfully and knowingly cast her vote in the election even though her name was not in the voter list. Members of opposition parties staged a dharna in front of the municipality office on Friday demanding that action be taken against Swapna. They also represented to the election authorities that criminal action be taken against her.  Swapna, however, argued that she has not done anything in violation of the law to cast a bogus vote. She said she had registered herself as a voter for the graduates constituency poll but had got no confirmation about her name being included in the voters list. She said she was informed that she could get the voter slip at the polling booth if her name was there. Swapna Parimal got to cast her vote against the name of another person, Swapna, whose name appeared in the voter list. Her surname is also Tatikonda and she is a close relative of the municipal chairperson. “There were agents of all political parties in the polling booth and no one raised any objection. I genuinely believed that I cast my own vote and I was not impersonating my relatives. It would be foolish on my part to think that my single vote would matter for the victory of my party candidate,” Swapna said. The name of T Swapna, wife of Aswin Tatikonda, was on serial number 528 in polling booth number 282 in Tandur Government Junior College in Vikarabad district. Swapna cast her vote against this name. Opposition parties petitioned chief electoral officer Shashank Goel in Hyderabad on March 15 itself giving evidence that the municipal chairperson had cast a bogus vote. “We want immediate action to be taken against her,” Mohammed Asif, former municipal vice-chairman, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/tandur-civic-chief-in-spot-over-bogus-vote/articleshow/81595334.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

---||Pune||Time for solving question banks, mock tests & calm||Pune: Experienced teachers and officials at the State Council of Education Training and Research (SCERT) said brushing up the important topics, taking three-hour mock tests would help students taking the board exam in April. Students can also watch the one-hour YouTube videos uploaded by SCERT to solve the frequently asked questions. Psychologists have urged parents to be extra sensitive during this time as most students are already stressed about not being able to finish their studies or not being able to go to school. Parents Must Help Dinkar Patil, chairman of Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education said, “Students should now be psychologically prepared for examinations and in this aspect, parents can help. We have often seen parents getting stressed which automatically translates into anxiety among students. There is a pandemic but the board will take all measures to ensure that the students are safe at the exam centres. All you need to do is to give your wards the confidence and students should keep practising. Students must make use of all question banks, YouTube videos facilitated by the education department.” Stick To One Book Bhagwan Pandekar, a mathematics teacher at Laxmanrao Apte Prashala, said students must try to stick to one textbook instead of relying on multiple ones. He suggested Balbharati textbooks over others. “Ensure that you are able to solve the 1 mark, 2 mark questions so that passing the subject is not a problem. Attempt questions that you are confident about and then move to other questions in decreasing order of your confidence about the topic. Graphs are easy and also get you quick 3 or 4 marks and hence should not be missed. Try solving all direct questions before moving to application questions. Ensure that you correctly write all the steps before leaving it if you are unable to solve further. Read the formulae every day,” he said. A Time Table Is Better Swati Rairikar, a science teacher at Renuka Swaroop High School, advised students to draw up a time table and stick to it. She also told them to pin the formulae, important reactions, definitions, periodic table among others on a soft board facing the study table so that every day the student can read it at least twice. “There are chapters with high weightage such as those based on electromagnetism, chemical reactions. Study them well. If possible, read through the chapter once instead of just solving the question answers,” said Rairikar. Both teachers emphasised on solving question papers and also ensuring that students know the answers to all the questions given in the question bank by the SCERT and to keep revising them. Psychologist Kinjal Goyal said students must not expect a complete control of the situation. “With Covid-19 still around, the situation is changing almost daily. Take it as it comes. Trust those who are making the rules and follow these rules. Boredom and burnout are affecting a majority of students. Be kind to yourself. Eat well and hydrate. Take small breaks and indulge in activities you enjoy. Seek professional help if need be,” she added. Conquer Anxiety Goyal said parents’ anxiety can rub off on their children and hence advised them to stay calm. “Do not believe in rumours and await official announcements. With rising cases, rumours are everywhere and they add to the overall sense of anxiety and helplessness. Understand that the world is going through this together. Everyone is suffering. Be kind to yourself and to your children. Encourage children to follow an active lifestyle even at home and to eat healthy. Be supportive and encouraging. If you feel that your child needs help and is not coping well emotionally, don’t wait. Talk to them and seek help from a psychiatrist or psychologist at the earliest,” she added. Study Material Problems A TOI report had said that the school education department on Monday released question banks for students of standard X and XII to help preparation. But it had created quite a stir among students. Several of them took to social media complaining that it included parts of the syllabus that have been reduced for the upcoming exams. After consultations with parents’ groups and teachers, the education department on Monday uploaded on its website a subject-wise question bank for the students. A student said, “There isn’t a single topic from the textbook that isn’t part of the question bank. How will this help us prepare better? Almost all questions from the textbook are included so how would we know what is important?” The education department has stated that the question bank is only for practice and it wouldn’t mean that the board exam papers would be set only on the basis of that.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/time-for-solving-question-banks-mock-tests-calm/articleshow/81594162.cms||Ardhra Nair

A team of officials, adhering to the Madras high court order issued on February 10, sealed 22 units.Responding to a case filed by farmer-turned-activist T M S Rajendran, the court had observed that burgeoning brick kilns that encroach into forest lands and elephant corridors should be proceeded against without undue delay.Officials from the Tamil Nadu pollution control board (TNPCB), mining department, department of geology, revenue department and Tamil Nadu generation and distribution corporation launched the sealing drive at 8.30am. Notices stuck on the sealed units said they were shutting illegal units operating at Chinna Thadagam, Veerapandi, Nanjundapuram, Somaiyampalayam and Pannimadai based on the court order and directions issued by the Coimbatore collector on Wednesday.While 197 brick kiln units are operating in the valley, the officials plan to close those closest to the forest in the first phase. “Owners of other units will be asked to close on their own. We have issued notices to more than 170 units,” collector K Rajamani said. “If they fail to obey the order, we will close the units.”The court order observed that brick kilns have mushroomed all over the state and the general refrain is that local authorities have turned a Nelson’s eye to the illegal operations.Rajendran welcomed the sealing drive. “However, sealing the units is not enough. Criminal proceedings should be initiated by TNPCB against the owners for the extent of damage and illegal operations,” he told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/22-illegal-brick-kiln-units-sealed/articleshow/81595343.cms||---

---||Coimbatore||Builders brace for brick shortage||Coimbatore: The 197 brick kiln units at Thadagam produce around 1,500 tonnes of bricks a day, which are used by contractors across Coimbatore, Tirupur and the Nilgiris.While the units were sealed and reopened several times in the past, builders in the region expressed worry about the latest drive. Though they have begun using alternatives like fly ash bricks, bricks have distinct advantages. If Thadagam shuts down, they would be forced to source bricks from Dharapuram, which may become very expensive.At least 100 loads weighing 150 tonnes each are driven out of Thadagam a day to construction sites across the region. Builders in Coimbatore shell out Rs 20,000 for 3,000 bricks. The price goes up depending on the distance.“We have been using fly ash bricks and porotherm bricks. Only 10% of our projects use bricks as they are heavier and more expensive. Now, sourcing has become a problem,” says Coimbatore Builders and Contractors Association (Cebaca) charter president C T Narayanan. “But I don’t see the construction industry being hit badly by the closure, because this is something we have begun preparing for a while.”Bricks are preferred for housing projects because of certain advantages, says D Singaravelu, founder of Prolific Housing. “They are more long-lasting compared to the alternatives. They last up to 100 years and have insulation properties, leading to people inside feeling slightly cooler. But being heavier, steel requirement is higher, pushing up costs.”Sourcing bricks from Dharapuram will make them much more expensive and logistically tougher than from Thadagam, Singaravelu added.Meanwhile, V Sampath Kumar of the Coimbatore District Brick Producers Association slammed the latest sealing drive. “We have been functioning for the past 40 years. The hill area conservation authority was set up only in 2006. We have been paying the mining department a fee of Rs 70,000 a year per kiln, based on which they issued us challans. They knew we were mining. It was not illegal or hidden.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/builders-brace-for-brick-shortage/articleshow/81595349.cms||---

The Shoolagiri police identified the deceased as Nandeesh Reddy, 27, an engineer from Anandpur district in Andhra Pradesh, his friend Shashank Reddy, 27 and Rupesh Rao, 34, of Bihar. A police officer said the incident occurred when seven engineers from Anandpur were heading to Chennai in the MUV to participate in an event. Nandeesh Reddy was at the wheel. “When they neared Samalpallam on Bengaluru-Chennai National Highway, the speeding truck, which was coming from the opposite direction, suddenly hit the MUV, killing Nandeesh Reddy and Shashank Reddy on the spot,” the officer said. After ramming the MUV, the truck also hit a roadside signal post, which fell on Rupesh Rao, who was walking in the area. “He also succumbed to his severe head injuries on the spot,” the officer said. When alerted, the Shoolagiri police sent the injured to the government hospital in Krishnagiri town. The dead bodies were also sent to the same hospital for postmortem. Preliminary inquiry revealed that a tanker truck had hit the parcel truck on its rear side. “The parcel truck driver subsequently lost control over the vehicle, which jumped the median and hit the MUV,” the police officer said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/salem/3-killed-as-truck-hits-muv-signal-post/articleshow/81595347.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The CM said India being the largest democracy in the world and Myanmar’s immediate neighbour “needs to do more and open up more”. He urged Modi to “to intervene so that the political refugees from Myanmar are given asylum and provided food and shelter here in the country”. Zoramthanga also pointed out to the PM that the Myanmar areas bordering Mizoram are inhabited by Chin communities, “who are ethnically our Mizo brethren with whom we have been having close contacts throughout all these years even before India became independent”. “Therefore, Mizoram cannot just remain indifferent to their sufferings today. India cannot turn a blind eye to this humanitarian crisis unfolding right in front of us in our own backyard,” Zoramthanga wrote. He added, Last week, the MHA’s NE division had pointed out that states and UTs have no powers to grant ‘refugee’ status to any foreigner and India is not a signatory to the UN Refugee Convention of 1951 and its 1967 Protocol. The MHA’s instructions were issued amid reports of Mizoram’s Champhai issuing notification that those who are in danger of persecution from the Myanmar military junta would be regarded as refugees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mha-advisory-on-myanmarese-not-acceptable-mizoram-cm-zoramthanga-tells-pm-modi/articleshow/81597303.cms||Prabin Kalita
---||Pune||eVin data entry gaps fixed, shots no more in short supply: Officials||Pune: Senior health officials on Friday said the vaccine stock data entry gaps on the Electronic Vaccine Intelligence Network (eVin) have been resolved. Such niggles had disrupted supplies of vaccine to Pune district a few days ago. Officials said now the issues have been resolved, vaccine supply in Pune was likely to ease up. eVIN is an indigenously developed digital database of vaccine stock that can be accessed via a smartphone application. Till a few days ago, health department authorities said, eVin had been showing an excess of unused vaccines in Pune district, though much less was actually available. This was mainly due to the data entry gaps in the stock actually used at various levels of the vaccine cold chain. This was also one of the reasons why the state government had initially stalled vaccine dispatch to the district. A senior health department official said, “All data on vaccine stocks in Pune has now been updated.” Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, also told TOI that vaccine supply would now ease up, as the data gap issues were largely resolved. “The district received a fresh stock of 76,000 Covishield doses on Thursday, of which the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) was allocated 30,000 doses. We had earlier received 50,000 doses of Covaxin for the district on March 14, followed by another lot of 1 lakh doses — 50,000 Covishield and 50,000 Covaxin — on March 15. The 76,000 doses of Covishield we received on Thursday take the number to 2.26 lakh vaccine doses in the past few days.” Deshmukh said the district would continue to get doses in the coming period, though it was not known whether Covaxin or Covishield, or both, would arrive. Pune zilla parishad chief executive officer Ayush Prasad told TOI, “Vaccine availability in various parts of rural Pune is currently much higher than what it was a few days ago. There is currently no issue in vaccine supply in the rural areas. The data gap glitches have been largely resolved.” Explaining the data entry gap issue, a senior health department official said, “Several units at the district and civic level have to feed in data of vaccine stocks received and used on eVin. At times, this is delayed at the level of various cold chain points, which causes a mismatch in actual availability. This reflects on eVin. But when such issues arise, all the centres concerned are informed about the data gaps and told to update the figures in real time. After the issue was resolved, the district received more doses on Thursday.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/evin-data-entry-gaps-fixed-shots-no-more-in-short-supply-officials/articleshow/81594167.cms||Neha Madaan

---||Goa||Goa officials bullied by Karnataka at Mhadei site||KERI: Goa officials were bullied, verbally-abused and their movements restrained during a chaotic inspection at the Kalasa project site in Kankumbi. The inspection, scheduled by Karnataka with only three days for the Supreme Court-mandated deadline to expire, turned out to be a farce as the southern state deployed a huge posse of policemen at the Goa border at Chorla, at the Kalasa site, and at the PWD inspection bungalow. While the SC directed that the inspection should be carried out by one superintending engineer each from Goa, Karnataka and Maharashtra, the Goa representative, MK Prasad, found himself outnumbered as his Karnataka counterpar, Krishnoji Rao, was accompanied by a dozen or so senior officials. Reporters from Goa weren’t allowed to leave the state, as police on the Karnataka side didn’t allow them entry. Rao, Prasad and Maharashtra representative Vijaykumar Mohite were to visit the site, conduct the inspection, and submit the report to the SC. Only this team was to conduct the site inspection and submit a report of the ground realities at the Kalasa site, where Goa has accused Karnataka of violations by diverting the natural flow of the Kalasa nalla into the Malaprabha basin. Two junior engineers and two technicians of the Goa WRD were driven out of the inspection bungalow at Kankumbi, where the joint monitoring team was compiling its report behind closed doors. Khanapur PI Basagauda Patil drove out junior engineers Agnelo Fernandes and Bipin Karapurkar without provocation. Meanwhile, senior Karnataka officials, including managing director of Karnataka Neeravari Nigam Ltd and the chief engineer of Karnataka’s WRD, were seen walking in and out of the joint monitoring team meeting. The police inspector also forced the Goan JEs, as well as this reporter, to remain standing. The PI also verbally abused them, restrained their movements, snatched their identity cards and subjected them to cross-questioning. This reporter’s camera was also searched by Patil. All visitors from Goa were let off after subjecting them to ill-treatment for more than an hour, and only after assistant engineer, Goa WRD, Dilip Naik arrived at the scene and took strong objection to the treatment meted out to the Goans. In the meantime, the hydrologist from Karnataka entered the joint monitoring team’s meeting and attempted to influence the monitoring team on how no violations had been carried out by Karnataka at the Kalasa site. The hydrologist was allowed to make a presentation on Friday to the joint monitoring without any intimation. Till late on Friday evening, the pressure tactics continued, with the Goa representative, MK Prasad, still at the inspection Bungalowbin Kankumbi. The work of filing the report by the team was delayed due to the unwarranted presentations organized by Karnataka. Also, contradictory to the apex court directives to constitute only a three-member joint monitoring team, Karnataka government out of its own accord nominated another superintending engineering posted in Hidkal, Dyamannavar RB, to co-ordinate the team’s visit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-officials-bullied-by-ktaka-at-mhadei-site/articleshow/81595351.cms||---

The observation was made by a division bench comprising justices AK Jayasankaran Nambiar and Gopinath P in the judgment on an appeal (W.A. No. 222/2021) filed by Biju CV of Koothattukulam through advocate Kaleeswaram Raj. The appellant was in an expired PSC rank list for the regular post of university assistant at Cochin University of Science and Technology (Cusat) but the court found that some temporary posts of university assistants were created when the rank list was still valid. In the judgment, the court said, "Inasmuch as the university is an entity that answers to the description of ‘State’ within the meaning of that term under Article 12 of the Constitution of India, it would be incumbent upon them to adhere to the principle of fairness in action which forms an integral aspect of the Rule of Law. The university cannot be seen as excluding a consideration of candidates found meritorious for filling up regular posts, while filling posts that are temporary in nature..." "In our view, when there are regularly sanctioned posts of university assistants in Cochin University, and there are temporary posts created in addition thereto for the purposes of meeting administrative exigencies, the principles of fairness would mandate that, while filling up the temporary posts, a right of first refusal be extended to those candidates who are empanelled in a list prepared by PSC, and are waiting for appointment to regular sanctioned posts of the same category. This is not to say that PSC should be involved in the selection process of candidates to temporary posts aforementioned, but only that the merit of a candidate, who has undergone a selection process, at the instance of PSC, cannot be ignored while filling up temporary posts of university assistants." Further, the court directed Cusat to give preference to candidates in current PSC rank list when temporary appointments are made to the post of university assistants.  The notification issued by Cusat should also state that due preference will be given to candidates in a current PSC rank list, the court directed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/give-preference-to-psc-rank-list/articleshow/81594170.cms||---

The court granted him bail as he “could not have possibly committed the offence”. During the hearing of bail application filed by accused Aslam Chandsab Kalagar, KRP claimed that he was required in custody to recover stolen property. KRP registered a case of theft against Kalagar and showed his arrest on January, 25. However, Kalagar’s lawyer argued that the applicant was in judicial custody at Colvale central jail when the offence is alleged to have been committed. Kalagar was arrested on January 13 by Verna police and was enlarged on bail on February 5.  The investigating officer Miguel Vaz, upon being questioned by the court, did not deny the fact that the accused was in judicial custody as on the date of the offence. The court granted bail to Kalagar on furnishing a personal bond of Rs 10,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/man-held-for-crime-while-he-was-already-in-colvale-jail/articleshow/81595381.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

As per instructions of the district collector, the restaurants should shut down by 9 pm. However, the restaurants were operating even around 10 pm. People were found having food inside the restaurants and no one was following the basic Covid norms,” he added. The restaurants were fined between Rs 5,000 and Rs 10,000, and the amount was collected on the spot from the restaurant owners. Most of the restaurants were in Yeola city and along the Yeola-Manmad Road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/7-restaurants-fined-rs-50000for-flouting-covid-norms/articleshow/81592663.cms||---
---||Mumbai||50% quota cap is not justified, Maharashtra to SC||NEW DELHI: Pressing for removal of 50% cap on reservation, Maharashtra government, while justifying its decision on Maratha reservation, told the Supreme Court that the number of socially and educationally backward people has increased over the years and there is an urgent need to increase quota to uplift them. Referring to the apex court’s decision to decriminalise homosexuality, former Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Maharashtra, contended before a five-judge Constitution bench that law cannot be static and it should evolve with changing times and as per the societal needs and in that context, the apex court’s 1992 verdict fixing cap on quota must be re-examined by a bench of 11 judges. The bench, comprising Justices Ashok Bhushan, L Nageswara Rao, S Abdul Nazeer, Hemant Gupta and S Ravindra Bhat, is examining the constitutional validity of the Maharashtra law granting reservation to Maratha community by breaching the 50% ceiling. Rohatgi contended the Constitution did not prescribe any cap on reservation and left it for the government to decide and the court should have refrained from fixing the limit. “I am not saying the Indra Sawhney verdict was completely wrong and it should be thrown in the dustbin. But 30 years have passed since the verdict was pronounced and many things have changed. Backwardness has increased, population has increased. With the passage of time, periodic review is needed. There was earlier no concept of transgender, but the court has now recognised it. The law which was earlier considered reasonable becomes unreasonable with change in thinking of society,” Rohatgi said, while pleading the court to refer the issue to a larger bench for a holistic relook. He said the nine judges, who were part of the Indra Sawhney verdict, were not unanimous in fixing the cap and even thereafter the courts had not spoken in one voice on the issue. “In 70 years, we have not reached anywhere near our ideal goal. We have not achieved the goal set by Constitution makers. That is why the Constitution was amended many times including the103rd amendment to grant reservation to economically weaker sections,” he said. The state government had framed the law on November 30, 2018 granting 16% quota for Marathas in government jobs and admission in educational institutions. While upholding the law, the Bombay high court on June 27 last year directed the government to bring it down to 12% for education and 13% for jobs as recommended by a state-appointed backward class commission headed by former HC judge M B Gaikwad. Challenging the HC order, the petitioners contended the HC misread SC judgments to conclude there is no stringent ceiling limit of 50% reservation as set out in the 1992 Indra Sawhney case. The main plank of the bunch of petitioners challenging the validity of the Maratha quota is that it took the total reservation beyond the 50% ceiling on quota put by the SC. They submitted the 50% ceiling fixed by the Supreme Court must be honoured and it cannot be breached. They alleged the state government had enacted the SEBC Act under political pressure, completely disregarding constitutional principles of equality and rule of law.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/50-quota-cap-is-not-justified-maha-to-sc-in-mumbai/articleshow/81595403.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary
---||Coimbatore||Kamal Haasan offers SEET to help Tamil Nadu students enter MBBS courses||COIMBATORE: Actor-turned-politician Kamal Haasan’s Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM) has promised to replace the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test with the State Eligibility cum Entrance Test (SEET) for medical admission in the state, if his party was voted to power. It was one of the biggest promises in the party’s election manifesto that was released in the city on Friday. The party has also promised to provide jobs to 50 lakh to one crore people and double the per capita income in 10 years. Pointing out that most government school students in the state were finding it difficult to crack the NEET, Kamal said the SEET question papers would be framed based on the state board syllabus to make it easy for the students to crack the exam. The MNM seems to have envisioned a plan to revamp the state’s education system by abolishing Class X and XII public examinations and introducing a four-year-long pre-graduation programme from Class IX. The manifesto said only one examination - either public examination or entrance examination - will be held. Terming the manifesto a ‘living document, he said the same was prepared with a long-term vision and not a poll stunt. Kamal also took a dig at other major political parties, saying freebies and doles promised by them would only add more burden to the already debt-ridden state. He said the MNM had better ideas other than relying only on tax and getting loans to promote growth, generate revenue and bring the state out of debt. He said the government-run enterprises like Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation could be turned profitable, by making employees shareholders. Referring to the financial assistance that other parties had promised for homemakers, the actor said the MNM would creating an environment for them to earn by honing their skills. “With the skill development, women will be able to earn better on their own.” The MNM also promised to set up ‘Makkal’ canteens, which would be different from ‘Amma’ canteens and ration shops. The specialty is that people could purchase groceries and other items from ‘Makkal’ canteens at a reasonable price. It also vowed to implement former president A P J Abdul Kalam’s Provision of Urban Amenities to Rural Areas (PURA) plant to make villages self-sufficient and turn unorganized workers into organized workers. “All the schemes mentioned in our manifesto are practically possible to implement,” Kamal said. When asked about the recent income-tax raid on the premises of the party’s treasurer A Chandrasekaran, Kamal said it was a raid on an individual and had nothing to do with the MNM. “Action will be taken against him if he is proven guilty.” Later in the day, Kamal took to Twitter to slam the ruling party for not utilizing the Nirbhaya fund fully. His tweet read, “The state government has utilised only Rs6 crore from the Nirbhaya fund that was allotted to ensure the safety of women. As much as Rs190 crore was allotted to the state from the fund. A PIL was filed seeking the court direction to utilise the fund completely. The AIADMK government has not taken much interest in women safety.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/kamal-offers-seet-to-help-tn-students-enter-mbbs-courses/articleshow/81595384.cms||Nivedha Selvam
---||Pune||Mass vax in one region won’t curb spread: Guleria||Pune: National Covid-19 task force member and director of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Dr Randeep Guleria said mass vaccination in the most-affected states would not be of help much because of the possibility of a spike in cases in the adjacent areas in the absence of restrictions on inter-state travel. “One cannot cover one area with vaccination while allowing movement of people from one state to another, which in turn, could see a sudden spike in cases. If we carry out region-wise vaccination, we shall only be chasing the virus rather than having a comprehensive plan to break the chain of transmission and decrease mortality,” he said, adding that such spikes might only see more variants of the virus emerge. Dr Guleria said the focus should be on completing the inoculation of beneficiaries in the priority group and protect the aged from the coronavirus threat. The aim should be to vaccinate a large number of people in this age group, bring down hospitalisation and the death rate, he said. Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and Baramati MP Supriya Sule have been seeking mass vaccination of those above 18 years in the state. Dr Guleria said wider vaccination would be welcome, but not at the cost of the vulnerable population being left out. Dr Guleria was hopeful that two more vaccines — Sputnik V and that of Zydus Cadila — might get emergency authorisation within 6-8 weeks. It would help ease the pressure of production on Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech though they had been asked to ramp up their production, he said. “If more vaccine players are there in the market, the pressure on the existing companies would be eased and more age groups can be covered under the vaccination drive according to the demand and supply,” Dr Guleria said, adding that there were plans to get 50-plus beneficiaries vaccinated within the next three months. On when the vaccines could be available in the market, Dr Guleria said the vaccine was not available off the shelf anywhere around the world. “It is not there in the US too. Unless the priority population is addressed, and we have enough doses, it is unlikely that you will see Covid-19 vaccines in the local chemists’ shops,” he said. Dr Guleria also called for more genome sequencing with the new variants surfacing. “We need to do much more genome sequencing. At present, we have 10 labs and that network can be expanded,” he said. He said variants of a virus were a natural phenomenon. “Whether the variant has assumed clinical significance in terms of causing more cases or more severe disease or developed an immune escape mechanism by bypassing the immune system or the vaccine that is being administered needs to be examined. The current data does not suggest this. However, studies should continue,” he said. Focus on aggressive testing, vaccination On the rising cases across the country, especially in Maharashtra, and the second wave, Dr Guleria said the situation had not yet gone out of control and there was a need to remember the lessons learnt last year. Strictly adhering to the Covid rules, aggressive contact tracking, testing and isolation, and aggressive vaccination should be the key areas of focus, he said. “One should understand that the nationwide sero survey clearly stated that only 21% of the population had developed antibodies. So, the remaining 79% are susceptible to infection. Moreover, with the spread and new mutants, the only way out is to follow all the protocols,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mass-vax-in-one-region-wont-curb-spread-guleria/articleshow/81594203.cms||Nisha Nambiar

As per the data available, the positivity rate was around 44% on Tuesday which came down to 32% on Wednesday and further down to 28% on Thursday. “Earlier, we used to conduct RT-PCR tests only for people who had symptoms. But now we have increased contact tracing and started collecting swab samples of high-risk contacts of those people who have tested positive for Covid. Random testings are also being carried out. These are the reasons why the positivity rate has fallen,” Nagargoje said. Recently, a central government team had visited Nashik to review the Covid situation and in its report, the team had expressed concerns over the city’s high positivity rate. The city reported an average of 99 new cases every day in the first week of February, but there was a sudden spike in new cases from the second week. Also, in the first week of March, the city reported average of 262 cases per day and the number tripled in the second week. On average, 714 cases were being reported every day. Moreover, the Nashik city has recorded 1,096 cases per day on average between Monday and Thursday. The city had witnessed a rise in new cases of Covid in the month of September last year where on average 867 cases per day were reported across the city. The positivity rate in that month was 40%.

No casualty or injuries have been reported in the incident till late on Friday evening, said an AFES officer, adding that things will be clear after the fire is doused completely. According to a fire brigade official, the fire broke out at Marudhar Industries Pvt Ltd. The company manufactures aluminium foil food container, plastic pouches for food packaging and zipped plastic pouches, said a fire brigade officer, adding that the materials are inflammable due to which it was very hard to control the fire. The officer said that earlier four fire tenders were sent to the spot as they got a call that flames erupted after a blast in a boiler at the company. Later, the fire brigade deployed 12 more vehicles and when it became difficult to douse the flames, the AFES gave the brigade call and rushed all 38 vehicles at its disposal to the spot. Local residents said they constantly heard blasts and flames could be seen from 1km away. Fire-fighting was on at the time of going to press.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/major-fire-breaks-out-at-plastics-unit-in-vatva/articleshow/81594237.cms||---

Most autos with revised fare meters are in eastern suburbs — with 12,395 autos till Friday afternoon having latest fares displayed on electronic meters. Mumbai Taximen Union leader A L Quadros said meter recalibration could be delayed due to introduction of a system wherein meter repairers will have to fill up data on a computer app. Over two lakh autos are yet to be recalibrated, with a deadline set of May 31. “This should have been introduced earlier. Recalibration of all meters could be delayed by two months,” he said. Auto and taxi drivers can collect revised fares based on a RTO approved tariff card, which shows new and old fares. Thampy Kurien of Mumbai Rickshawmen’s Union said repairers will have to spend more for digitizing data, and they have to get trade certificates. State transport commissioner Avinash Dhakne said the system was ‘transparent’ and will ensure an entry at every level of recalibration and data is digitised. Officials said in the western suburbs, 6,893 autos had recalibrated meters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/31k-autos-675-kaali-peeli-taxis-get-recalibrated-meters-in-mumbai/articleshow/81595415.cms||Somit Sen

The service is to facilitate those out-station tourists staying in the trust’s guest house and don’t have any transportation facility to visit the tourist points in Diu. The bus with the capacity of 23 passengers will depart from the guest house in the morning for Diu and cover places like Gangeshwar Mahadev, Nagoa beach, market, church, museum and Diu fort. Diu administration will provide a guide and the trust will provide lunch. Somnath Trust secretary PK Laheri said, “This plan by the Diu administration will also have a bus service to Somnath temple to facilitate those who visit the union teritory.” According to the temple trust, tourists coming from outside the state also want to visit other places, which is often impossible owing to long distances.

---||Pune||Maharashtra: Show zero tolerance for Covid norms violations, says task force||PUNE: The state government task force for Covid-19 has called for a three-pronged approach in view of the spike in Covid-19 cases — random testing at public places, increased vaccination of priority groups and a zero-tolerance policy towards those flouting norms. The task force has suggested that rapid antigen tests be made mandatory at public places like bus stops, railway stations, markets, malls, and cinema halls. The state government has pitched this idea to local government bodies, but an official order was awaited till the time of going to print. “The Union government has told us to ramp up testing and all public places that have movement of people must be placed under strict surveillance through testing,” task force member Shashank Joshi told TOI, adding that they have already suggested this to the Mumbai civic body. “All other local bodies may want to follow suit,” he said. Joshi further said the public health department needs to improve vaccination in the rural areas by opening more centres. On Thursday, the state had registered 25,833 new coronavirus cases – its highest one-day rise in infections since the beginning of the pandemic last year. The state’s previous high was 24,886 cases on September 11. State health secretary Pradeep Vyas said there could be three lakh active cases in Maharashtra by the first week of April if this trend continues. On Thursday, the state had 1,66,353 active Covid-19 cases. As per the Union health ministry’s data on Thursday, the state accounted for 63.21% of the daily new cases. Joshi said there was a need for a “circuit-breaker” to snap current chain of transmission. “We need to declutter poorly ventilated places and ramp up testing — both RT-PCR and rapid antigen methods. Those not following norms should face penalties,” he said. The task force further suggested that local bodies could consider making it mandatory for people to carry negative test reports in public places. The task force emphasized that vaccinating the targeted priority groups at the earliest and increasing centres in rural areas was the need of the hour. Meanwhile, the Indian Medical Association, in a statement on Friday, said that it was “painful” to note that despite adequate healthcare, infrastructure, public awareness, and stringent control measures, there is a surge in cases, indicating the beginning of the second wave. “We urge everyone to come forward with a more dedicated ‘test, trace and treat’ protocol without falling prey to unscientific, self-centred promotion of certain drugs and procedures,” the statement read. On Tuesday, the municipal corporations of Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad issued identical orders iterating the restriction orders issued by the state government on Monday to control the rising Covid-19 cases. The civic bodies’ orders warned malls, hotels, restaurants, cinema halls, marriage halls and religious places to strictly follow the mask, sanitizer and social distancing protocols, failing which the establishments would be shut down. The same rules apply to private offices, the orders issued by both the municipal corporations added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/state-task-force-calls-for-random-testing-at-public-places-zero-tolerance-for-violations/articleshow/81594243.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Vadodara||Year on, nCov comes full circle in Vadodara||Vadodara: Things seem to have come a full circle one year after the first case of Covid-19 was reported in the city and district. A NRI from Spain on a visit to the city had tested positive for Covid-19 on March 20,2020 and since then the feared virus never loosened its grip. From the only case on March 20 last year, the city and district saw the peak of the first wave with 135 new Covid-19 cases being detected on a single day on September 19. After a significant downturn, the viral outbreak has raised its head again and this time around it seems to be more spreading faster. Sources involved in management of Covid-19 in the city pointed out that things have changed drastically in one year. “It seems that it may not be possible to identify the source of infection to a person. One can get infected anywhere if one does not remain careful,” said an official. While not blaming the civic polls and other events directly,an official pointed out that gatherings in the recent past may have led to the present situation. “It seems that the virus is spreading faster, but is not as lethal as it was earlier,” the official said. Former head of the department of community medicine at the Baroda Medical College Dr V S Mazumdar said that apart from other things, the years howed us how people were willing to let go of caution if things close to their heart like festivals or polls. Officer on special duty (OSD) for Covid-19 Vinod Rao said that when the pandemic began, there was no clue regarding treatment. “Today, we have a vaccine on hand and clinical methodology for treatment. We are in the midst of the second cycle now which could be bigger than the first,” he said. Mazumdar added that the past year had taught us lessons in prevention in public health as well as need to invest more in health, both as individuals as well as the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/year-on-ncov-comes-full-circle-in-vadodara/articleshow/81594491.cms||Sachin Sharma

The injured guard, Lal Saheb Singh, a native of Ara in Bhojpur, is critical. The robbers also took away his double-barrel gun, people who saw the robbery unfold said. The ATM is in a posh and busy market area with hundreds of business establishments and houses of retired and serving bureaucrats under the Shreekrishna Puri police station limits. The loot amount could have been much more as the van had Rs 54 lakh in cash when it reached the ICICI Bank ATM kiosk. Manoj Kumar, an eyewitness, told TOI that the cash van stopped in front of the kiosk from which the security guard came out and took his position in front of the ATM kiosk. “Another person came out from the cash van with a bag and entered the kiosk. Immediately, one of the looters came from behind the van and sneaked up to the guard and threatened him, but the guard pulled his gun at him after which the criminal opened fire,” Kumar said. He said the robber then pointed his pistol at the cash van staff inside the kiosk and snatched the sack containing money. “Two men on a bike were waiting for him just a few feet ahead. He jumped on the bike and they fled,” Kumar said, adding, the robber also snatched the guard’s firearm but threw it away, which was later recovered by the police. He said the injured guard was rushed to a nearby hospital in the same cash van by his colleagues. City SP (central) Vinay Tiwari and SHOs of at least four neighbouring police stations rushed to the spot. Tiwari, who questioned the cash van employees at the hospital, said the looters followed the cash van for a while before executing the robbery. “It had started from the private firm’s office at Kankarbagh. Van staff had deposited money at several ATM kiosks on the way and several more were to be replenished even after the ICICI ATM kiosk,” he said. The SP said prima facie it seems the criminals were eyeing only the money that was being loaded in the kiosk. “Else there was Rs 54 lakh inside the van which was for replenishing several other ATMs,” he said, adding raids are on to nab the criminals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rs-9-lakh-looted-from-atm-van-in-patna/articleshow/81593536.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ATS seeks Sachin Waze’s custody, NIA takes him to spot near Antilia||MUMBAI: The Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) told the Thane sessions court on Friday that they require the custody of assistant police inspector Sachin Waze to unearth his involvement in the conspiracy connected to the murder of businessman Mansukh Hiran, whose Scorpio laden with explosives was found abandoned near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence on February 25. The court will hear the matter on March 30. On Friday night, the NIA team took Waze to the spot outside Antilia to recreate the scene of crime. Waze was asked to walk across a couple of times and then walk with a PPE kit on. The entire thing was video-recorded, a police officer said. Police were also deployed near the spot. Videos from February 25 have shown a man wearing a PPE kit walking across. The ATS opposed Waze’s plea for pre-arrest bail, and it wants to know what happened to Hiran from the night of March 4, when he left his home, to March 5, when his body was found in a creek in Mumbra. Waze is in the custody of NIA till March 25 for its case of planting the explosives. The ATS mentioned in their application before court that they want to know the location of the Scorpio from the 18th to the 25th of February after it was stolen from Vikhroli. They also want to recover the gold chain, gold ring, wristwatch, some cash and the mobile phone of Hiran. The ATS has in a sealed envelope submitted the findings of its investigation to the court. “Waze had on March 8 appeared at the ATS office and gave his statement in our case. However, we found differences in his statement and the findings in our probe.  Hence we seek his custody,” an ATS officer told TOI. The ATS has also recorded statements of some doctors who carried out the post-mortem on Hiran’s body and some policemen from Mumbra police station, who had carried out the inquest panchnama after Hiran’s body was recovered. Waze’s advocate Aarti Kalekar told the court that Waze’s sister, Anuradha Hatkar has filed an intervention application. She has alleged harassment of the family by the media. An NIA team led by Anil Shukla, inspector general, visited the Mumbai police headquarters on Friday afternoon and met the newly-appointed police commissioner, Hemant Nagrale. Besides, a six-member team of the Forensic Science Laboratory from Pune arrived at NIA’s Mumbai office and collected spare parts of the seized Innova for forensic examination in the explosives scare case. The Innova, a property of Mumbai police, was used to accompany the Scorpio on the night of February 25. The Mumbai FSL has examined the Scorpio. It is also carrying out analysis on the viscera samples of Hiran. Meanwhile, on Friday, special NIA court judge Prashant Sitre rejected Waze’s fresh plea to allow him to consult with his lawyers privately while in custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaiats-seeks-wazes-custody-nia-takes-him-to-spot-near-antilia/articleshow/81594263.cms||---

Badgujar alleged that the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) is not conducting proper screening of Covid suspects. Also, the Morwadi hospital in unable to cope up with the rush of both Covid and non-Covid patients. The protesters also demanded that the civic body should increase the screening of Covid suspects. “Apart from the out patient department (OPD), Covid tests and vaccinations are also being done here. As a result, there is a footfall of over 500 people at the hospital at any given point in time. Hence, we want the NMC to decentralise the testing of Covid suspects,” Badgujar said. “There has been a spike in number of Covid-19 cases in the Cidco division of the city. But the NMC’s health department is yet to increase the screening and testing. We staged the sit-in to make the civic administration aware of the spike in cases and their negligence in tackling the situation,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/city-sena-chief-stages-sit-in-at-cidco-hospital/articleshow/81592695.cms||Tushar Pawar

A similar fire took place there December 20 evening and it raged for more than an hour. But the fire on Thursday afternoon was bigger than usual and three tenders had to be deployed to control it. A KMDA official said, “The fire raged because of the accumulated dry leaves. The fire brigade was called in immediately and the flames were doused after a while.” KMDA is the custodian of the green zone, popularly called the Dhakuria Lakes. The green complex is spread over 192 acres with a 73-acre waterbody at Southern Avenue. Lake activist and morning walker, Sumita Banerjee, said, “Everything should be done to prevent such fires in the Lake that is an eco-sensitive zone. The fire caused much smoke in and around Rabindra Sarobar on Thursday. Only three months ago, there was another blaze. The fire keeps recurring and the authorities do nothing about it. We feel that the dry leaves are deliberately set ablaze so it is easier to get rid of them.” The KMDA official, however, refuted Banerjee’s contention and said, “We have a proper team to dispose of the dry leaves. Why would anyone deliberately set the biomass on fire? We have asked the security personnel to be more vigilant from now on, so that such fire will not be repeated in the future. We shall also find out whether any mischief was behind the incident.” Green activist, SM Ghosh, convenor of Sarobar Eco Lovers’ Forum (SELF), said, “KMDA promised the National Green Tribunal (NGT) that biomasses generated inside the Lake would be recycled after being transformed into fertilizers through decomposition in a segregated area. The rotting biomass causes foul smell in some parts of the Lake. KMDA also promised to set up a compost plant here to convert the bio-waste into manure. Nothing has happened so far.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/fire-at-rabindra-sarobar-leaves-greens-fuming/articleshow/81594267.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

Now, those have been rescheduled on April 17, according to the decision made by HCBA poll panel members on Friday. A notification issued by members, including Bhanudas Kulkarni, Arun Patil, Firdos Mirza, Prakash Meghe, and Sangram Sirpurkar stated that elections scheduled on March 25 weren’t feasible in prevailing conditions. They clarified that the ballot papers printed for March 25 polls would be used on April 17 and counting of votes would be conducted the same evening. The much awaited polls were being postponed for the same reason since last year. Even this year, they were initially fixed on March 12, but were rescheduled to March 25 after many contestants tested positive for coronavirus and requested a delay. It was also decided to conduct voting in five HC halls, of which one would be reserved for women. The HCBA executive committee had suggested conducting online voting to avoid frequent postponement due to the pandemic, but the poll panel ruled it out. A multi-pronged fight is on the cards for most of the posts, except treasurer and secretary, where only two candidates have filed their nominations. However, unlike the 2017 polls, none of the big names are keen to contest this time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hcba-polls-deferred-again-till-april-17/articleshow/81593380.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Mumbai||BMC zeroes in on contractor for Shivaji Park development||MUMBAI: Ignoring Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray’s offer to carry out the entire Rs 4 crore revamp of Dadar’s Shivaji Park free of cost by bringing in corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds, BMC has shortlisted a contractor for the work and will spend civic funds for it. Civic officials said the contractor was shortlisted after following a tendering process and the work will begin next month. MNS chief Raj Thackeray had written to municipal commissioner I S Chahal seeking permission to bring in CSR funds for the project. Raj Thackeray had requested Chahal to stop the tendering process for the revamp plan and said by carrying out the work using CSR funds, BMC will save Rs 4 crore at a time when it was facing a financial crisis. “There were no instructions to stop the tendering process from senior officials. So the tender was processed as per norms and a contractor has been picked. Now, the proposal will be sent to the standing committee for approval,” said the official. “BMC officials have told me that a Rs 4 crore revamp of Shivaji Park is going to be carried out. In fact, it was MNS corporators and MLA who had initiated and set up the rainwater harvesting system at Shivaji Park. This rainwater harvesting system was shut in 2017 and neglected. When MNS was in power in Nashik Municipal Corporation between 2012 and 2017, we had completed several major projects using CSR funds,” Raj had said in his letter to Chahal. Chahal had said last month that the ward had already gone ahead with the tenders. On Friday, Chahal asked TOI to get in touch with additional municipal commissioner (city) Sanjeev Jaiswal, saying he was aware of the facts. Jaiswal did not respond to a query from TOI. “BMC is opting for a private contractor instead of going in for CSR funds. This shows BMC has some vested interest in favouring contractors. The BMC officials-contractor nexus is at play,” said MNS leader Sandeep Deshpande.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bmc-zeroes-in-on-contractor-for-shivaji-park-devpt-in-mumbai/articleshow/81594620.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

So far, the Pune Zilla Parishad (ZP) has declared 13 such villages as hotspots with 10 or more positive cases. According to ZP records, most cases have been detected at industrial villages in Khed tehsil (7) and three each in Maval and Shirur tehsils. ZP chief executive officer Ayush Prasad told TOI, “We have asked all companies in these areas to carry out testing of their employees at regular intervals. Most of the companies are conducting the tests sincerely as they also fear closure of activity.” The administration has further decided to launch a door-to-door survey of symptomatic patients in these villages with the help of the local administration, said Prasad. “The positive patients from these villages are asymptomatic and no deaths have reported so far this year. This is a very positive sign. Maximum companies have appointed their medical officers to carry out testing and provide medical aid to their employees on time,” he added. Abhay Tidke, additional district health officer, said, “Employees in the industries work in a closed environment. Even in case someone is an asymptomatic patient, if the individual doesn’t report to the company, the negligence could prove risky for other workers in the unit. To avoid this, we have categorically asked companies to carry out mass testing of their employees on a regular interval. A small mistake could cause huge loss to the company hence they should understand the gravity of the situation.” In the last year, Khed tehsil administration had closed a couple of companies after several employees tested positive for the virus. That company took almost three weeks to resume their work normally. “No establishment wants to face this situation again hence they are taking precautions at their level itself. We have also told our local administration to keep a tab on the situation at industrial units that are located under their limits to take timely action and contain the spread,” said Prasad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/infections-rise-in-villages-in-khed-shirur-maval/articleshow/81594265.cms||Sandip Dighe

Besides contending that there is no case against them on merit, the then police inspector Saiyed and police sub-inspector Gohil also submitted that the prosecuting agency, the Central Investigation Bureau, has not obtained mandatory permission from the competent authority to prosecute them under the provisions of section 197 of the CrPC, sources said. The court issued notice to the CBI and posted hearing on April 3. Both the accused cops have also court parity with co-accused, who were discharged by the special court earlier. Last month, the court had discharged retired DySP Tarun Barot and police constable Chhatrasinh Chudasama in this case. On November 24, 2020, the then police inspector R L Mavani and police constable Ajaypalsingh Yadav were dropped from the list of the accused against whom charges were to be framed. The court had observed that the chargesheet did not reveal any evidence of their involvement in the case. Earlier, retired DySP K M Waghela’s discharge plea was rejected. Another accused DySP JG Parmar has died pending the trial. In all, eight police officials were booked for killing Sadiq, a youth from Bhavnagar, whom the city crime branch had claimed was a trained Lashkar-e-Taiba operative sent to kill the then chief minister Narendra Modi to avenge the 2002 riots.

Oxygen-supported beds would also be available at Covid care centres. “We have enough beds for patients but the decision to start the jumbo hospital has been taken as a precautionary measure,” said mayor Murlidhar Mohol. PMC officials said that a structural audit of the facility has been carried out and the civic body has received a green signal from the auditor to start the facility. “The jumbo hospital will be a multi-purpose unit for Covid-19 management. Apart from treating patients, the facility will also function as a Covid care centre,” said Rajendra Muthe, a senior PMC official. According to civic officials, the standing committee of PMC has approved Rs7.5 crore for reopening the facility. It will be used for infrastructure and manpower management. Money will be given for payment of salaries to doctors, paramedical staff, medical equipment and other expenses. The funds will be used for running the facility for the next three months. One more jumbo facility has been set up at Baner using corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds. This facility has around 350 beds. Reopening of Annasaheb Magar hospital at Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) is also being considered. “The final decision has not been taken yet. But we may reopen it, if required,” said a senior official of PCMC. The power supply to the war room of the jumbo centre was interrupted on Friday. “The supply to the entire facility was not affected, only supply to the war room was disconnected,” said Muthe. A statement issued by the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd said that the power utility disconnected supply to a private company on the premises of the jumbo hospital owing to bill arrears to the tune of Rs6lakh. “However, as soon as we were told that the company runs the war room of the jumbo hospital, supply was immediately restored. Power supply to the jumbo hospital or any Covid hospital was not disconnected,” the statement added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/100-oxygen-beds-to-be-made-available-at-coep-jumbo-unit/articleshow/81594275.cms||---
---||Amritsar||‘Govt misusing FCI’: Protests over new procurement rules||BATHINDA: Farm organisations organised protests across 16 districts in Punjab on Friday to oppose the FCI’s move to tighten specifications for procurement of foodgrains, saying that the central government was misusing government food procurement agency Food Corporation of India to “punish Punjab farmers for leading the sustained struggle against central farm laws”. Farmers also protested against the FCI’s move to ask farmers to upload land records before procurement. Protesters handed over memoranda to officials of the market committees in the name of the Prime Minister, demanding withdrawal of newly-enforced specifications. Farmers also observed the Muzara Movement Shahadat Diwas to pay tribute to those who fell to atrocities during the 1930s and 1940s while demanding land ownership rights for tenant peasants. Four peasants were killed in police firing at Kishangarh village in Mansa on March 19, 1949. Farm organisation BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) handed over memoranda in 51 mandis spanning over 16 districts of the state while activists held protests at 42 places in Punjab. Constituents of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha held protests at toll plazas in 68 places across Punjab, outside railway stations, business establishments of corporates and outside residences of BJP leaders. Farm organisation BKU (Ekta Dakonda) general secretary Jagmohan Singh said, “these new specifications are aimed at punishing Punjab farmers. Directions about uploading land records are not workable as there are about 16 lakh farmer families with landholdings but only 9 lakh of these are into tilling of land. Many have leased out lands to others. Under such circumstances, distribution of money for crop procurement would cause a lot of heartburn.” Farm organisation BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokri alleged that the Narendra Modi-led Central government is working on the agenda of harassing Punjab farmers and causing them financial loses for taking the farmers’ struggle ahead. “We will face every ploy of the government but will not sit back and keep on fighting,” he claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/govt-misusing-fci-protests-over-new-procurement-rules/articleshow/81594272.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Crimes against women up in state in 2019: CID||Crimes against women and scheduled tribe communities, and robberies, increased by 4.5% to 9% in Maharashtra in 2019, compared to 2018, state criminal investigation department (CID) said. In its latest report, ‘Crime in Maharashtra-2019’, details of which were released on Friday, CID said the state’s overall crime rate (crimes per 1 lakh population) at 287.4% was eighth among states in 2019. Indian Penal Code (IPC) and special legislative law crimes reduced by 1.5% and around 0.7% respectively in 2019. The rate of crime against women (crimes per 1 lakh women population) was 63% in the state, Amravati city recorded the highest rate of crime against women at 142.5%. Mumbai recorded most crimes against women at 6,519. Serious offences like murder, dacoity and property were less in 2019. “The state’s 2019 annual crime statistic report, which would have come by the end of 2020 normally, got delayed partly on account of the delay in release of National Crime Record Bureau’s Crime in India Report for 2019, and Covid-19 pandemic,” Pallavi Barge, CID’s superintendent of police (law & research) told TOI on Friday. The CID 2019 report said dacoity cases have declined by 20% in 2019 as against 2018. Cases of robbery increased by around 4.5%, as against 2018. Crime against SC/ST communities increased by 8.9%, as against 2018. Altogether, 18,916 people died by suicide, while 14,608 people were killed in road accidents in 2019. A total 891 graft cases were registered against public servants in 2019. Barge said, “Crimes under categories like robberies, crime against women and SC/ST communities are on the rise every year due to increase in population, poverty and social causes. The general crime falling in other categories reduced partly because of increased police presence during the 2019 state assembly elections.” The CID had reported a 20% rise in IPC crimes across Maharashtra in 2018, compared to 2017 in its Crime in Maharashtra-2017 report released on September 4, 2020. A synopsis related to CID 2018 report stated that Maharashtra recorded a crime rate (incidence per lakh population) of 285.3.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/crimes-against-women-up-in-state-in-2019-cid/articleshow/81595429.cms||Asseem Shaikh

In a pandemic situation, it was thoughtful of the MTDC to get their employees access to the vaccine. If we are safe from the virus, our families will also be protected. I took the vaccine on March 18 at a hospital in Mahabaleshwar. Most of my employees in the region have also been vaccinated barring 2-3, who will get their shot in the next few days,” said Suhas Parakhi, manager, MTDC Mahabaleshwar. While tourism picked up for a few months after a long lull, there seems to be a dip again as people fear another lockdown. The increase in the number of Covid-19 positive cases has made tourists wary of travel. “In addition to cleaning and disinfection of restaurants and accessories, body temperature measuring systems, sanitising sprays, oximeters, masks, gloves and face shields will also be available for purchase at all MTDC properties. All the properties will provide facilities for medical emergencies as well. Tourists are being provided information about tourism facilities, food, information about the surrounding nature, local sports, traditions, cultural events, wildlife, as well as precautionary measures being taken by the corporation in that area through the MTDC website, Facebook and WhatsApp group,” said Deepak Harane, regional manager, MTDC (Pune region).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/shots-for-all-employees-of-mtdc-pandemic-related-gear-for-travellers/articleshow/81594277.cms||---

Already, the 9pm curfew—which started from Thursday—came as a jolt for hotel, restaurant and marriage palace owners, but capping the number of guests and allowing only wedding functions has hit the business hard as they are receiving many calls for cancellations. Businessmen said they would suffer huge losses and the government should reconsider its decision and increase the cap to at least 50% of the venue capacity and also allow other functions to take place.Speaking to the TOI, Amarveer Singh, president of Hotel and Restaurant Association, Ludhiana, said, “The new rule has come as a huge setback because more than 50% of the functions scheduled to take place till March 31 in Ludhiana’s hotels and marriage palaces have been cancelled or postponed. We have suffered the most in cases where the wedding dates are near. One of our associates had a big booking for a wedding scheduled to take place on Sunday and guests had already started arriving from all over India. With just a day to go, neither can the host cancel the wedding nor allow more than 20 guests. As a result, venue owner as well as the client will suffer huge losses as all the arrangements have been made and money paid in advance.” Asserting that hospitality industry had become a soft target for the government, Singh added, “We are not against taking the safety precautions, but restrictions on our industry alone is not justified. Why are cinema halls allowed to open with 50% capacity and factories allowed to operate fully even during night hours? Can coronavirus only spread in hotels, restaurants and marriage palaces?” SS Rai, a hotelier and general secretary of Punjab Tent Dealers and Welfare Association, said, “Due to the new restrictions, about 10 functions scheduled to take place in my hotel in the next two weeks have been cancelled, as majority of these were non-wedding functions like engagement, roka ceremony, anniversary celebrations, among others. Besides, two wedding have been postponed to next month. The government does not have any idea about the quantum of losses suffered by our industry.”Amarjit Singh Talwar, chief advisor of Hotel and Restaurant Association, Punjab, said, “Our industry was the worst sufferer of lockdown and curfews. The situation will not change until the government drafts an SOP, considering ground realities. We should be allowed to operate at 50% capacity otherwise our industry cannot be saved.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/new-rules-will-kill-our-business-says-citys-hospitality-industry/articleshow/81593396.cms||Mohit Behl

The move came days after the death of an attendant of the hospital in an accident. While cops have reinforced curbs on the crossover point in front of the RG Kar Hospital gate, buses have been directed not to stop before the emergency gate so that ambulances and doctors’ cars can enter and exit the hospital smoothly. Cops have also arranged for specific drop-off and pick-up points for taxis and app cabs. Those not obeying the rules are being fined. “The pressure is so heavy at the hospital gates that allowing a bus to stop for a few seconds is leading to a major traffic snarl on the bridge. Additionally, some buses are trying to encourage passengers to alight there, leading to accidents. Even with so much pressure, we have allowed passengers to get off less than 100m from the new gate beside the police kiosk,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/traffic-curbs-near-rg-kar-to-prevent-accidents/articleshow/81594278.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Ludhiana||Syndicate of psychotropic drugs busted, 15 arrested||LUDHIANA: The city police on Friday claimed to have busted an inter-state drug syndicate supplying illegal psychotropic drugs, with the arrest of 15 persons. As many as 66,99,719 intoxicating tablets, capsules, injections, syrups, worth Rs 54 crore in illegal drug market, were seized from a godown in Meerut, in one of the biggest crackdowns on drug cartels. The arrested accused included Hemant of Mohammadpur Sultan of UP, Anoop Kumar Sharma of Chandar Nagar in Civil Lines, Ludhiana, Loveleen Sharma of Chander Nagar in Ludhiana, Harjeet Singh of Kundanpuri in Ludhiana, Sumit Kumar of Guru Nanak Pura, Ludhiana, Gagandeep of Hargobindnagar, Jagatpuri in Ludhiana, Babul of Kundanpuri, Bridwan Road, Ludhiana, Karamjeet Singh of Pavitar Nagar in Haibowal Kalan, Ludhiana, Kulwinder Kumar of Sandhu Nagar, Civil City Road, Ludhiana, Kuldeep Kumar of JP Electrical, Bijli Market, Ludhiana, Kamaljeet Kamal of New Vishnupuri, Ludhiana, Jaan Saifi of Meerut, UP, Farjaan Sethi of Abdul Wali Gali in UP, Suraj Parkash of Partapur in Meerut and Mohamad Sadiq, also of Meerut. Police have also recovered drug money of Rs 5,44,814 from the accused. Cops said the nexus was unearthed after close surveillance and raids. The police have registered six FIRs and four of the accused were arrested from Meerut. An investigation into an NDPS case filed at Division 4 police station, Ludhiana, on March 1 led to the arrest of Anup Kumar Sharma with 1,29,200 intoxicating tablets. Commissioner of police Rakesh Aggarwal said this led to the arrest of another five persons who were in possession of intoxicants and subsequent registration of five more FIRs. He added that a number of money transfer agents and courier suppliers were also arrested for facilitating the illegal psychotropic drug trade. “Bank accounts used for money transactions / payments for drug consignments have been frozen. Interrogation of main accused Anup Sharma unveiled a chain of supply of psychotropic drugs from Meerut. The police team traced the chain to Jaan Saifi of Meerut, who used to procure drugs from Afjaan Saifi, Mohammad Sadik and Surya Prakash in huge quantities. Acting on disclosures made by these four, an illegal godown of psychotropic drugs was busted at Partapur in Meerut in the presence of drug control officials. A huge seizure of 66,99,719 intoxicant tablets, capsules, injections, syrups worth Rs 18 crore has been made,” the police commissioner added. “These are sold at almost three times the price (Rs 54 crore) in illegal drug market. The gang used to push pharmaceutical opioid drugs into the market by way of diversion from manufacturers, wholesalers and retail chemists and used pre identified network of couriers / transport / goods carriers, operating from major cities, to deliver consignments to various locations using local transporters. Payment and transfer of money was done via multiple online transactions into bank accounts especially created for this purpose. These pharmaceutical opioids cannot be sold without a valid medical prescription from a registered medical practitioner,” he said. Police said medically used for pain relief and treatment for opioid dependence, these were being diverted and misused because they induce analgesia (pain relief) and euphoria (feeling of well-being). They added that active drug users commonly use these as a substitute for opioids (opium and heroin) due to low cost and over the counter availability. Inappropriately high doses of these intoxicants can produce respiratory depression and circulatory failure leading to drug overdose death. With the arrest of these gang members, a well-oiled network of drug syndicate pushing consignments into Punjab and other parts of the country has been busted,” said police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/syndicate-of-psychotropic-drugs-busted-15-arrested/articleshow/81593414.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Vaccination of senior citizens in private hospitals to double from month-end||Kolkata: The number of senior citizens being vaccinated across private hospitals in Kolkata could be doubled once the second dose of inoculation for health workers and frontline workers come to a close in a week’s time. Hospitals are gearing up to divert their resources to scale up the number of 60-plus recipients even as the number of Covid cases keeps spiralling every day. Around 6,000-7,000 senior citizens are now being vaccinated each day across 20 private hospitals in Kolkata. It may go up to 12,000 once all health workers receive their second shot. The state health department had stopped distributing free vaccine vials for health workers a week ago. While the latter can get it free of cost at government hospitals, private hospitals must buy the vials. Most private hospitals have decided to absorb the charge for the second dose since only a few are left. The first dose for health workers came to a close on February 25. At AMRI Hospital, 80% of health workers’ second doses have been administered and the remaining would be completed in a week. “Across our three units, we are now vaccinating around 900 senior citizens every day. This could go up to 1,200 once the second doses are over by next weekend. In phases, the number will be stepped up further. We will be diverting all our resources to seniors from next week,” said AMRI CEO Rupak Barua. RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) is now doing 300-350 senior citizen inoculations a day. The hospital is ready to scale it up to 600 a day once the remaining 1,200 second doses for health workers are given by the end of the month. “The actual number will depend on the demand that we have a week from now. But going by the present trend, we expect the number of applicants to double. Within a fortnight, we hope to be able to inoculate everyone who drops in,” said RTIICS zonal head (east) R Venkatesh. At Peerless Hospital, around 200 senior citizens are now being inoculated every day. “We expect the second doses to be over within a week. We will then divert our resources to scale up the number of vaccines for senior citizens. Hundreds are queueing up every day. We are trying to inoculate everyone but some are going back, especially during the first half of the day, since they can’t wait for hours. Once we are through with the health workers’ second dose, we will focus on senior citizens and will aim to vaccinate at least 500 a day,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra. Medica Superspecialty Hospital has already finished administering the second dose to health workers and scaled up the number of senior citizen recipients to more than 1,000 per day. “We scaled up the number once we finished the second doses for health workers and frontline workers. It has helped to channelize all our resources on increasing the number of senior citizen recipients,” said chairperson Alok Roy. The hospital has been running a 24-hour vaccination service for the last two weeks. Belle Vue Clinic has completed the second dose for health workers as well and has stepped up the number of senior citizen recipients to 230 a day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vaccination-of-senior-citizens-in-private-hospitals-to-double-from-month-end/articleshow/81594325.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Kolkata||City hospitals tie up with police to help Pronam members take Covid shot||Kolkata: The state health department has tied up with Kolkata Police, which runs the Pronam programme with NGO The Bengal, to ensure that the senior citizens who live by themselves are not left out of the Covid-19 vaccination programme, Government hospitals have been asked to arrange for a dedicated vaccination site and re-organise facilities — like waiting and observation rooms — to offer the best comfort to these elderly group. This special project for vaccination is likely to start by Tuesday. “We have requested the authorities concerned for a smooth vaccination process for this elderly population. We are working on formalizing the whole initiative. Kolkata Police will make transport arrangements. We are also talking to nursing homes and private hospitals and asking if they could allot specific timings for them,” said Sundeep Bhutoria, honorary general secretary of The Bengal. Kolkata Police personnel involved in Pronam said they had around 18,000 senior members under the project. Even as inoculation for the 60 plus category started on March 1 and there has been an overwhelming response, many elderly who live by themselves are being left out as they unable to reach vaccination centres. “Also, with the number of cases rising now, we could encounter a significant spike by April second or third week. It may be a second wave. So we want to inoculate the maximum number of these vulnerable citizens,” said a senior health department official. On Wednesday, health officials and Kolkata Police convened an emergency meeting at NRS Medical College to work out on the modalities. Each government hospital will be tagged with one or more police stations. Kolkata Police will bring its Pronam members to the designated vaccinate centres and ferry them back home after the observation period. “A section of our members have already got vaccinated by themselves. We are preparing a list of those who have been left out and also include senior citizens who are not Pronam members but need assistance,” said a source at Kolkata Police. “On our part, we have decided to have a dedicated booth for this special effort and ensure zero waiting time,” said an official at RG Kar Medical College. Hospitals have suggested that these senior citizens be brought in batches of 10 in an hour’s interval to minimize waiting period. “We are altering our set-up to offer them more comfort,” said community medicine specialist Sanjib Bandyopadhyay vaccination supervisor at ID Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/city-hospitals-tie-up-with-police-to-help-pronam-members-take-covid-shot/articleshow/81594334.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Out of the 402 fresh cases on the day, Kota reported 64, Jaipur 61, Rajsamand 38, Udaipur 38, Jodhpur 34, Dungarpur 30 and Bhilwara 19.

RPF DG Arun Kumar also said the railways was providing free Internet to passengers and steps should be taken in coordination with service-providers to ensure porn sites are not accessible through the service. The letter said major complaints from women pertain to molestation, eve-teasing, harassment and unauthorised entry of male passengers in ladies coaches. “In suburban railway networks like Mumbai, women are victims of shoving, objectionable touching, groping and bullying,” the letter said.

---||Ludhiana||Test result: District’s average performance lands it at 8th slot||LUDHIANA: Despite reporting a high number of Covid-19 cases and deaths, Ludhiana is conducting lesser tests per million population than many districts of the state. However, the tests per million in the district are more than the state’s. As per the state health department data, Ludhiana was eighth in Punjab with 2,17,283 tests per million till March 13, when its case count was 28,636 and toll tally 1,050. Jalandhar, which had 23,535 cases and 761 deaths till the day, had conducted the highest number of tests—3,00,656 per million. Ludhiana’s figure is about 38% less than Jalandhar’s. Kapurthala was at number two with 2,95,403 tests per million. SBS Nagar was at number three with 284,905 tests per million even as the district’s total number of cases is five times less and deaths around eight times less than Ludhiana. Fazilka had the lowest tests per million at 92,964. Ludhiana’s 2,17,283 tests per million are higher than Punjab’s 1,78,475. The health department officials say lesser number of people is coming forward for testing. A senior official of the health department says, “There is hesitancy among people to get tested. And, it is challenging for the ground staff to motivate them. Besides, rumours about testing act as a deterrent.”  Health experts say most of the people are not getting tested, which is why tests per million are less in Ludhiana as compared with other districts of the state. “People are not coming forward for tests. As a result, many of those with Covid-19 visit doctors in advanced stages and it becomes difficult to save their lives. This is one of the reasons for increase in mortality,” says Ludhiana Indian Medical Association president Dr Saroj Aggarwal. Even as the district administration in February-end had set a target of 4,500 samples per day for health department, testing has been less than it except for a few days. Civil surgeon Dr Sukhjeewan Kakkar could not be contacted despite repeated attempts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/test-result-districts-average-performance-lands-it-at-8th-slot/articleshow/81593422.cms||Shariq Majeed
---||Chandigarh||Delhi-Katra eway: Farmers to join Delhi border protest||PATIALA: Hundreds of farmers protesting against the process of land acquisition for national highways, including Delhi-Katra Expressway in Punjab, will join the inter-state protest near Tikri border, where farmers from different states are protesting under the banner of Bharat Bhumi Bachao Sangharsh Committee against some upcoming national highways. Farmers from Punjab, who had joined the protest last month at Tikri, will join the inter-state protest near Tikri border on Sunday. In Punjab, a large number of farmers under Delhi Katra Expressway Kisan Sangharh Committee (DKEKSC) are protesting against land acquisition for Delhi Amritsar Katra Express Highway as they are not satisfied with the compensation amount, even though the state government announced that compensation would be enhanced. Farmers also want the state government to halt the process of acquisition of NHAI in Punjab till the issue of farm laws was resolved. Harmanpreet Singh Jeji, DKEKSC coordinator, Punjab, said, “On March 21, we will join the interstate protest around 12 km away from Tikri border. “Farmers from Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Delhi are already protesting against land acquisition for National Highways, including Amritsar – Jamnagar (NH 754K), Delhi – Mumbai Expressway (NH 148), National Highway 334 B, National Highway 344 M, National Highway 152 D and for Sonepat – Palwal Orbit railway line. This protest is under the banner of Bharat Bhumi Bachao Sangharh Committee headed by Ramesh Dalal.” According to Jeji, compensation for the land is not adequate. “The compensation was inadequate for our fertile land. It will be around Rs 50 lakh per acre while we are demanding Rs 1.5 crore as minimum compensation for each farmer. Only four years ago, the government had compensated farmers up to Rs 3.5 crore and even more in some cases. Land acquisition for the highways will divide the farmers’ land into two parts. Our land falls under ‘greenfield’ category. Farmers will be ruined after this land acquisition for Delhi-Katra as most of the farmers will have no access to their agricultural land on the other side of the highway, which is 12 feet in height,” he claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/delhi-katra-eway-farmers-to-join-delhi-border-protest/articleshow/81594347.cms||Bharat Khanna

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Doctor demands Rs 30 lakh dowry, issues rape threats to wife||AHMEDABAD: A dermatologist has accused her husband, who is also a doctor, of demanding Rs 30 lakh dowry from her parents and threatening to hire goons to rape her. The 29-year-old resident of Naroda filed a complaint against her husband, a resident of Gandhinagar, with the Women’s Police (East) on Thursday. She told cops that she met her husband, who runs a clinic in Dombivli in Mumbai, through a matrimonial site in 2019. On November 11, 2019, they got married and she began staying with him at his home in Gandhinagar. She alleged that, a week into the marriage, her husband and in-laws began seeking dowry from her. “They did not allow me to go to work. They would treat me like a slave. They would force me to do all the chores and thrash me if I said that I wanted to work as a doctor, too,” she stated. She alleged that her husband dropped her at her parents’ place in January 2020, then began pressuring her to bring Rs 30 lakh so that he could open a clinic. “When I refused to do so, my husband and his relatives began threatening to hire men to rape and defame me,” she alleged in the FIR. She said that her husband and in-laws also threatened to kill her. They also alleged asked her for a divorce if she could not bring the dowry. The police registered a complaint of domestic violence, uttering of abusive words, causing hurt, criminal intimidation, sexual harassment and abetment against her husband and two members of his family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/doctor-demands-rs-30l-dowry-issues-rape-threats-to-wife/articleshow/81594354.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Prodded by activists, political parties take up green concerns in poll manifestos||Kolkata: After a sustained campaign by the city’s environment crusaders, political parties have slowly started including green issues in their election manifestos. While the Left has incorporated a number of green demands made by experts in their poll manifesto, Trinamool has touched upon a few issues concerning the environment. Different groups, such as Bengal Clean Air Network (Bengal CAN) and Sabuj Mancha, and green activist Subhas Datta had long been urging political parties to include green issues in their poll manifesto, but to no avail. In a first, parties have started adopting green issues, possibly because of the concerns about the environment among common man. Worried over the degrading air quality of the city and state, Bengal CAN on February 10 launched a Clean Air Manifesto 2021-2026, an online petition urging political parties to include in their manifestos various green concerns, such as checking air pollution by creating policies and committing to reduce air pollution by 30% by 2024 from the 2019 baseline. It has already been signed by more than 8,000 citizens and is still counting. From those, CPM’s manifesto includes reduction in vehicular emission and environment conservation, both new to their poll agenda. CPM central committee member Mridul De said, “The Left Front’s election manifesto will focus on environmental protection and spreading awareness in response to citizens’ demand for clean air, as being campaigned by BengalCAN.” Trinamool’s manifesto mentions water conservation, access to electricity, better roads and livelihood opportunities but no attention has been paid to air pollution reduction or environment conservation. Minister of urban affairs Firhad Hakim said, “Unless the air quality of Bengal improves, we will lose out on many fronts, like health and economy. We are having discussions on environment and air pollution, with special emphasis on urban forests. We are focusing on increasing greenery.” Trinamool secretary general Partha Chatterjee said, “Our chief minister pays much importance to environment and air pollution. In case of industrialization, emphasis would be given on environment friendly techniques.” “In Bengal, air pollution is a bigger killer than Covid19. Kolkata, Haldia, Howrah and Durgapur saw 15%-70% increase in the Air Quality Index (AQI) this winter than last year. We thank Trinamool and CPM for acknowledging air pollution as a pressing problem,” said Vinay Jaju of Bengal CAN. “We are requesting our leaders to set stringent targets in pollution reduction and invest more on a post-Covid-19 green recovery,” said Gargi Maitra of Bengal CAN.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/prodded-by-activists-political-parties-take-up-green-concerns-in-poll-manifestos/articleshow/81594371.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Chandigarh||New stir cry: ‘Mandi bachao, kisan bachao’||JIND/KAITHAL: Farmers organised daylong “mandi bachao, kisan bachao” (save grain markets, save farmers) programmes in Jind and Kaithal districts on Friday. A cross section of people employed in the agriculture sector, including farmers, workers and arhtiyas, took part in events to press for the repeal of the three farm laws. Farmers said they sent out the message that all sections of society, including employees, labourers and small businessmen, were with farmers in the fight against the Centre. They also stressed on the need to organise the agitation with discipline and peace, saying that it would go on for a long time as the Modi government was adamant. Even though farmers of all age groups braved the coldest nights, the government ignored them, they alleged, claiming that the movement had become a “jan andolan” (mass movement). Two farmers, Navneet and Shamser Pliania, who came out of a Delhi jail after 32 days in connection with the January 26 incidents, were honoured with ‘kisan yodha’ award. Khera khap president Satbir Pahalwan said, “Farmers are getting overwhelming support in villages and the relationship between labourers and farmers is everlasting. The government should know that either the anti-farmer laws will be repealed or farmers’ bodies will return from Delhi borders.” “We followed the call of Sanyukta Kisan Morcha to observe ‘mandi bachao, kisan bachao’ programme. The government is not going to scrap the laws easily, so we have started mobilising people from villages to strengthen the agitation,” said BKU Jind district president Azad Singh Palva.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/new-stir-cry-mandi-bachao-kisan-bachao/articleshow/81594353.cms||VIJENDER KUMAR

The station is being redeveloped to add more facilities, but its heritage part would not be altered, he assured Rajya Sabha. Replying to supplementaries during the question hour, Goyal said he is particular about ensuring that wherever stations are redeveloped, their local identity, culture and traditional look are not hurt or damaged. Local heritage experts are also being consulted during the redevelopment process, he said. “Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus is the pride of Indian Railways and there is no question that in any manner its facade, structure or beauty will be changed. Efforts are on how to enhance it and add more facilities to the station,” he told the house. It has been noticed that during peak hours, a large crowd tries to enter the station as well as exit it and efforts are underway to resolve this, he said. If the entry and exit points are segregated, it will benefit passengers, he said. “The CSMT development does not impact the heritage side of the station. The development is being done on the D’Mello Road side and not on the heritage side,” he said.

---||World||UK PM Boris Johnson takes first jab of AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine||LONDON: British Prime Minister Boris Johnson received his first dose of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine on Friday and urged the public to do the same, saying "he did not feel a thing." Johnson, 56, received his vaccine at the same hospital where almost a year ago he was put in an intensive care unit and given oxygen via a tube in his nose after he contracted the virus and fell seriously ill. He later said he was so sick that plans were drawn up on how to announce his death. "I literally did not feel a thing. It was very good, very quick," Johnson said after receiving the injection at St Thomas' Hospital in London. "I cannot recommend it too highly, everybody when you do get your notification to go for a jab, please go and get it, it is the best thing for you, best thing for your family and for everyone else." Pictures showed the prime minister wearing a black mask, a shirt and tie with his sleeve rolled up while a nurse gives him the vaccine. Britain broke its record for the most coronavirus shots given out in one day on Friday and almost half of all adults have received one dose, making it one of the fastest countries in the world to roll out a vaccine programme. This success has helped the ruling Conservatives regain the lead over the main opposition Labour Party in opinion polls after the prime minister last year was accused of acting too slowly to stop the spread of the virus. Johnson received his vaccine as European countries on Friday resumed using the AstraZeneca shot after regulators said its benefits outweighed any risks following recent reports of blood clots. Countries including Germany and France reversed their decision to temporarily pause its use after reports of about 30 cases of rare brain blood clots sent scientists and governments scrambling to determine any link. The AstraZeneca vaccine, developed by scientists at the University of Oxford, has also been at the centre of tensions between Britain and the European Union, after Brussels expressed anger over the lack of deliveries of the shot coming from Britain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/uk-pm-boris-johnson-takes-first-jab-of-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine/articleshow/81597598.cms||---

The judges said the counter affidavit filed by the authorities stated that there is no violation in establishing the proposed shop. “In the absence of any malice in law, we cannot hold that the proposed shop is within the prohibited distance. The petitioner has also not produced any material in support of the contention,” they said.“A mere possibility of the problem that might arise by the location cannot be a ground for this court to interfere. No one can say that a liquor shop would create a law and order problem,” observed the judges. Due to the petitioner’s adventurism, the authorities would lose the revenue. It is found that the allegation is baseless. The judges observed that though it is a fit case to impose costs, they are not inclined to do so hoping that the petitioner would not repeat it without proper exercise, which is required while filing a public interest litigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-dismisses-plea-against-tasmac-warns-petitioner/articleshow/81595478.cms||---

The purpose of this law is to prove every citizen who raises his voice against the government as guilty. It will be difficult for citizens to raise their voice against the government after the enactment of this law,” he said. Hooda said the budget session of the assembly had disappointed every section of the state. “The government is pushing Haryana into a debt trap and about 95% of the budget is spent in payment of loans and interest, pension, salary and allowances. The government has no budget for infrastructure and other development activities,” he said. Hooda alleged that diesel became costlier by 28% and ration by 43% after the Covid lockdown. He also accused the government of failing to curb unemployment, saying the youth of Haryana have been experiencing the highest unemployment rate in the entire country for the last 2 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/withdraw-property-damage-bill-hooda/articleshow/81594373.cms||---

P Chellapandian, who is a native of Keelarajakularaman in Virudhunagar district, is the founder-president of the Tamil Nadu Tipplers Welfare Association. Speaking to TOI, Chellapandian said that a large number of people in the state consume alcohol while the state government generates huge revenue from Tasmac outlets, even during the lockdown, adding that cabinet ministers on several occasions stated that the revenue from Tasmac is being used to give freebies to the people.“Consumption of alcohol would definitely result in health hazards. Though the people who are consuming alcohol are sacrificing themselves to provide revenue for the government, there is no insurance cover for the drinkers. If I am elected to power, I will raise my voice in the assembly to provide insurance cover to tipplers,” he said.When asked about AIADMK and DMK parties speaking about introducing prohibition in the state, Chellapandian said DMK has been saying the same since the 1980s, while AIADMK in their 2016 election manifesto stated they would implement prohibition in a step-by-step process and would open de-addiction centres in the state, both of which have not materialised.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/candidate-vows-to-take-up-insurance-for-tipplers/articleshow/81595475.cms||Kaushik Kannan

But in a sign of their growing clout in electoral politics as well, over half a dozen well-heeled expats and returnees have been fielded by mainstream political parties as candidates in Malabar alone in this . After the election of Parakkal Abdulla, who had been an expat for three decades in Qatar, in the 2016 election from Kuttiyadi, the IUML has fielded three expats this election, including Pottankandy Abdulla from Koothurapamba, who has several businesses in the UAE and C H Ibrahim Kutty, an NRI businessman with business interests spread across education, travel, manpower recruitment, etc. as UDF independent candidate in Peramba constituency. The LDF too has fielded expat businessmen like K P Sulaiman Haji, who has been an expatriate for three decades in the Gulf and has businesses in Saudi Arabia, as an independent candidate in Kondotty. K V Abdul Khader, the sitting MLA of Guruvayur and state general secretary of Kerala Pravasi Sangham, the expat organization of CPM, said that the expat returnees who have been fielded by the LDF include Gafoor P Lillis in Tirur and Paloli Abdul Rahman in Malappuram. Lillis had been an expatriate for 19 years in UAE and had been active in various Left-aligned expat organizations like Shakthi Theatre, Kerala Social Centre, Abu Dhabi, etc. “While the contributions by the expatriates in the social and economic sector of the state are very significant, they have not received adequate political space in Kerala. But things are slowly changing with many expats and expat returnees entering the fray this time,” Khader said. Apart from the deep pockets of many expat candidates, political parties also hope to take advantage of their Gulf connect, which is expected to strike a chord with the electorate in areas like Malappuram, where one in every three households has a Gulf expat. LDF candidate in Kondotty P Sulaiman Haji said that as a person who had built a business group spread across Saudi Arabia and UAE from his humble beginnings as a cleaning staff in a hotel in Saudi Arabia in 1982, he was better placed to have first hand understanding of the issues and aspirations of the general public in the constituency. The expat organizations like KMCC, OICC, and Kerala Pravasi Sangham have constituency wise committees in the Gulf and are engaged in campaigns through social media.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/now-expats-make-a-mark-as-candidates/articleshow/81594401.cms||---

A bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni heard a PIL by Pune resident Arjun Khanapure that challenged arbitrary collection of double toll as fine for non-use of FASTag and urged it to continue cash payment in Maharashtra. Senior advocate Birendra Saraf, for NHAI, submitted an amendment to Motor Vehicle Rules, 2020 which state that four-wheelers after January 1, 2021 shall have FASTag installed. Additional solicitor-general Anil Singh also said FASTag was mandatory. “Do you mean to say those cars not having FASTag are illegal and don’t have to ply on roads?’’ asked Kulkarni. Petitioner’s advocate Uday Warunjikar said farmers and illiterate persons may not know about FASTag. The judges said drivers are expected to be aware. Singh said the driver who has a licence to drive is supposed to know about FASTag. Saraf said no relief was granted on similar petitions filed in high courts of Kerala and Karnataka.

Responding to a tweet by Green Sainikpuri, KTR tweeted, “Request @arvindkumar_ias to have a preliminary meeting on the illegal closure of roads in SCB. We will certainly stand with our citizens in ensuring the unwarranted inconvenience is addressed.” As part of the ‘Azadi Ka Amrut Mahotsav’ celebrations commemorating the 75th year of Indian Independence, FNECS launched a Twitter campaign highlighting the road closure issue. From the @greensainikpuri handle they tweeted to KTR, “There should be a political will to address this issue which is affecting millions of civilians spread in 3 municipalities and 5 out of 8 wards of SCB. Sir we beg @KTRTRS Garu to give us 5 min...help us collaborate with state government with all relevant doc...Additional roads are welcome. But one additional road cannot solve the problems created by closure of 21 public roads. You have the power to get all these illegally closed roads opened.” An hour later KTR responded to that tweet and directed the principal secretary to convene a meeting to discuss the issue. Thanking KTR, secretary of FNECS, CS Chandrasekhar said, “We have forwarded all the relevant documents to the MA&UD officials on Friday. The documents include the list of 12 roads, official communication of the ministry of defence (MoD) regarding the reopening of the roads and a copy of the letter addressed to principal director, DGDE, Southern Command, Pune.” An FNECS member said that the campaign is aimed at securing freedom for about 3.5 lakh residents. “At a time when the country is celebrating 75 years of freedom, the people are denied the same due to the illegal closure of roads by the local military authority (LMA). Daily we are tweeting on one major problem that we encounter due to the closure of roads. We tag Union defence minister, top officials of MoD and the top brass of the Telangana government,” the member said.

But now it has gone up to 90%, posing a threat to those who are vulnerable as asymptomatic people can be super spreaders,” said Dr G Srinivasa Rao, director of health. As a precaution, state health department has asked all districts to increase Covid-19 testing with RT-PCR facility and set a target of 4,000 tests daily, with 450 of them to be done in Hyderabad. “Till now more than 90% tests were Rapid Antigen Tests. Most tests being done in districts hospitals are largely depended on the Truenat and RAT,” said one official. In addition to this, officials have increased surveillance in border districts of Nizamabad (Maharashtra) Bhadradri Kothagudem (Chhattisgarh), Mahbubangar, Jogulamba Gadwal (Kurnool district of AP) and Sanga Reddy, Vikarabad (Karnataka).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/as-asymptomatic-cases-rise-t-makes-rt-pcr-must-in-dists/articleshow/81596356.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

They have decided to vote only if a political party gives it in writing that their demands would be fulfilled.President of the Tamil Nadu Appalam, Vadagam, Morevathal Sangam, G Thirumurugan said the hub consisting Chinnthamani, Anupanadi, Chinna Anupanadi, Anupanadi housing board, Villapuram and Villapuram housing is home to about 10,000 families, who are into manufacturing of papad. From Madurai alone, these manufacturers export papads to the tune of Rs 300 crore per month.“It has been 15 years since these places were brought under the Madurai Corporation, but the political parties come only for our votes, and later conveniently forgot us. We continue to work in the worst conditions like overflowing sewage and open drains, as there was no UGD system in place in the areas,” Thirumurugan said.“All the surrounding areas have proper drinking water supply but we are forced to drink saline bore water or purchase can water,” he said, adding that the lack of a UGD system affected their prospects for obtaining FSSAI licence, which is a must for the food industry now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/left-ignored-papad-makers-in-madurai-to-boycott-polls/articleshow/81595491.cms||---

In her FIR at Ramol police station, the woman stated that she had married in 2010 but divorced four years ago. She has two children, while her son lives with her ex-husband, her five-year-old daughter lives with her. She stated about a month and a half ago, her friend suggested that she remarry and took her to the house of Kirtikumar Modi in Ramol, where she met him and his wife, Krupa. “Krupa introduced me to a man and spoke to him about marrying me,” the complainant stated. “Our match was agreed, but I later had a disagreement and called it off,” she stated. “About two weeks ago, Krupa introduced me to another prospective groom. Due to this I visited her house often,” the complainant stated. “On March 9, Krupa called me and said that she was sick and was admitted at Durga Hospital near Soni ni Chali. She asked that I stay at her home for a few days and do the domestic chores while she was in hospital. I went there that day with my daughter,” she stated. “On March 11, Krupa was discharged from hospital. She asked me to stay on as she was still not fully healthy,” she said. “On March 15, I went to sleep at about 11pm. At about 5am, Kirtikumar came to where I was sleeping and lay down next to me. He began touching me and I woke up. When I protested, he said ‘If you do not let me do this with you, I will do it with your daughter’. He then began removing my clothes. He then removed my leggings and despite me pleading with him not to, he forced himself on me,” she stated. She added that as she was traumatized and scared at the time, she did not tell anyone but left with her daughter. She approached police on Thursday. Inspector M S Kotaval, the investigating officer, said, “We have apprehended the suspect and are waiting for the result of his Covid-19 test before we formally arrest him. He is 41 years old.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/matchmakers-husband-rapes-woman/articleshow/81594409.cms||---

The actor had sought to be excused from appearing before the commission which had summoned him twice .“Unlike a shooting spot where public will gather in large numbers, it will be in-camera proceedings at the commission and outsiders will not be allowed. There will be hardly five people including counsels at the commission. The commission is a much safer place than the shooting spot. So, we think there should not be difficulty for him to come and testify before the commission,” Arul Vadivel, counsel for the Retired Justice Aruna Jagadeesan Commission, said.He was speaking to reporters at the commission’s camp office here on Friday after the completion of its 26th sitting. The actor was summoned for his comment to journalists on May 30, 2018, that ‘intrusion of anti-social elements” was reason for the mob turning violent eventually leading to the police firing at them. The counsel said that they will summon police personnel who were on bandobust duty in Tuticorin on May 22 and 23, 2018, at the 27th sitting to be held next month. In all, 31 of the 45 people who took part in the protest were examined at the 26th sitting that began on Monday. With this, the total number of people examined so far has gone up to 672.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/commission-office-safer-for-rajinikanth-than-shooting-spot/articleshow/81595494.cms||---

The meeting was held as the cases across Tamil Nadu are going up again with many cases also being reported among students and teachers.“So far, there have been no Covid-19 cases among students in Madurai, thankfully.

---||Chandigarh||‘Tool to crush dissent, get back at farmers’||Rohtak: Reacting to the passage of a bill for recovery of damage to public and private properties from protesters, Congress party president Kumari Selja on Friday said the state government brought it to corner farmers protesting on Haryana-Delhi border. Interacting in Rohtak on Friday, she said the new law, passed by the ruling BJP-JJP government, had clauses which could be used arbitrarily to silence dissenting voices. “It would have been good if sufficient time had been given to discuss the bill before it was brought in the public domain for opinions but sadly it was forcefully done in the state assembly,” she said. On the brewing dissent in the Congress party (G-23) where several senior leaders of the party raised their voice against the high command, Selja said the matter is already in the knowledge of the party high command. “It is being looked into by the party high command. It is the internal matter of the Congress party and the BJP should introspect,” she said. As for the panchayat elections, Selja said the BJP-JJP government has been delaying panchayati raj elections deliberately for fear of public backlash. “Both parties in power know that they can’t go out in the public due to anger owing to the ‘Kisan Andolan’, so they are prolonging the dates of panchayat elections,” she claimed. On the recent controversy over ripped jeans by new Uttarakhand chief minister Tirath Rawat, she said the statement is an indication of the regressive mindset BJP leaders sitting at the helm of power have. It would have been better if CM Rawat had expressed concern over rising crime against women, she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/tool-to-crush-dissent-get-back-at-farmers/articleshow/81594410.cms||---

The accused also extorted money from people in the USA by using their social security number. Kshitiz Bali, Abhishek and Dhananjay Negi have been identified as the main accused. The racket was busted following a raid at a building in Uttam Nagar from where two illegal call centres were being operated. DCP (cyber cell) Anyesh Roy said a total of 34 persons were arrested. The owners of both the call centres were also nabbed from the spot, he said. “It was found that the victims, usually people living in the US, were being called and threatened with their social security number. The callers then used to extort USD 2,000 from the victims by impersonating as officials of the US drug enforcement agency. Many victims were also told to buy gift cards worth the amount and share the card numbers with the accused,” Roy said. The DCP said, one of the main accused, Kshitiz Bali, was a graduate and had been operating the fake call centre for the past four years. “Their victims are usually residents of English-speaking countries. Bali had created multiple teams, which used to handle different types of scams, including the social security number scam and technical support scams,” he said. The accused posing as employees of law enforcement agencies also used to dupe foreigners by telling them that their bank accounts and other assets are being frozen as their details have been found at a crime scene. They either extorted money from them or made them buy Bitcoins or Google Gift cards. The other teams impersonating as technical support staff used to call foreigners and tell them that their devices had been compromised. They would then cheat them on the pretext of providing antivirus support. Police said the other two accused, Abhishek and Dhananjay Negi, were also graduates and running the scams for almost one year now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/gang-dupes-foreigners-34-in-police-net/articleshow/81609138.cms||---

Farm organisation BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) too remembered the martyrs. “The Malwa region was the epicentre of the muzara movement as tenants in over 700 villages were at the receiving end for raising their voice,” said BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) vice-president Jaswinder Singh Longowal. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/skm-pays-tributes-to-martyrs-of-40s-stir/articleshow/81594480.cms||---

He said the CM was getting angry on seeing good people because of his regular contact with wicked people. “When the CM was continuing governance with gold smugglers and dollar smugglers in his office, people like E Sreedharan were working for the development of the country. That is why the CM is getting angry seeing people like him and feeling sympathetic towards smugglers and corrupt persons,” he said.

---||Agra||Man shoots lover dead for ending affair, tries to frame her bro for murder||AGRA: A 21-year-old woman was shot dead allegedly by a married man in Mainpuri’s Nagla Lalman village after she refused to continue her relationship with him. The suspect was arrested on Friday and remanded to judicial custody. Avinash Pandey, Mainpuri SP, told TOI that during interrogation, Ajab Singh, 28, told police that he shot her after a heated argument with her over her recent engagement with another person. He was furious as she was not willing to continue her four-year-old relationship with him. He said he had called her on the night of March 16 but she disconnected the call and when he tried again, her cell phone was busy. Next morning, the woman asked him to meet her in the field. While Ajab reportedly tried to convince her not to marry, she refused and asked him to end their relationship. After hearing this, Ajab whipped out his country-made weapon, which he had recently bought, and shot her dead. “The murder weapon has been recovered,” the SP said. Ajab then tried to make the case as one of honour killing and put the blame on the woman’s brother. Ajab had earlier claimed that the woman’s brother, Avadhpal, saw him with her in the fields and killed her. Subsequently, the brother and his four associates beat him up and forcibly took him away in a van. Later, they dropped him in Kanpur’s Bilhaur area, where he was admitted for treatment. The SP said Ajab’s story about being taken in the van was found to be incorrect as police found no evidence of the incident after scanning the CCTV footage of the area. Besides, other statements given by him also did not match the scene at the crime spot. Pandey added that the deceased’s family could not believe that Ajab could murder as they had good relations with him. In fact, they had lodged a police complaint against two local youths.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/man-shoots-lover-dead-for-ending-affair-tries-to-frame-her-bro-for-murder/articleshow/81592798.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

According to the Railway Protection Force (RPF) officials, the TTEs also caused a delay of around 50 minutes after creating a ruckus at the Roorkee railway station. Soon after the episode, the RPF and the GRP (Government Railway Police) registered separate cases against the two TTEs and the passenger, a resident of Jaipur. According to sources, the passenger was heading to his hometown Jaipur from Haridwar in coach S-4 of Rishikesh-Barmer Express when he was asked by TTE Karandip Singh to show his ticket. To this, he told the official that his trip was unplanned and that he didn’t get the time to book a ticket. This ensued a brawl between the two. Subsequently, TTE Singh was joined by an unidentified colleague and both of them allegedly thrashed the passenger, leaving him with bruises on the face and lips. “The passenger was booked under sections 138 (travelling without ticket) and 145 (causing endangering the safety of any person) of the Railway Protection Force Act. Meanwhile, the TTEs were booked under sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 325 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt) and 504 (intentionally insult) of the Indian Penal Code,” said VK Mishra, assistant commandant, RPF, Haridwar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/train-delayed-for-50-min-as-tte-thrashes-passenger-for-ticketless-travel-booked/articleshow/81593463.cms||Tapan Susheel

---||Ahmedabad||Sawai beyt: HC moved for access to shrine||Ahmedabad: A controversy involving religious sentiments and national security over an uninhabited island near Saurashtra coast has reached the Gujarat high court after the authorities restricted devotees’ access to an ancient shrine of Sawai Peer. A petition filed by the Sawai Peer and Itar Peer Dargah Masjid Trust has contended that the authorities stopped trustees and devotees from going to Sawai beyt, an island near Shiyal beyt. But, the petition has claimed, a temple was constructed illegally on the waqf land there. The petition has said that while the authorities have blocked access to the island and the shrine citing national security, the government itself has planned to develop the island into a tourist spot. The trust has alleged that the authorities have usurped waqf land by allowing a temple to be constructed on the land vested in the shrine. The trust has urged the high court to direct the authorities to allow free access for devotees to the shrine. The trust wants the Tourism Corporation of Gujarat Ltd (TCGL) restrained from executing its plan to develop the island for tourism. The trust also wants the removal of the alleged illegal construction of the temple at the island. After a preliminary hearing on March 3, Justice Vipul Pancholi had issued a notice to the authorities concerned and sought their reply by March 24. The court has also sought a reply from the Gujarat State Waqf Board, which has already requested the Amreli district authorities to remove the temple from the shrine’s land and not to restrain devotees from visiting the shrine. In their petition, the trustees mentioned that the shrine is the resting place of Hazrat Rabi bin Sabi Basri Baghdadi, the third general companion of Prophet Muhammad who had arrived in India in AD 775. After pointing to the site’s religious significance, the petitioners submitted that the marine police inspector had informally restrained the caretaker from going to the shrine and the island in January 2020. Upon resistance, the district authorities issued a notification in March restricting entry to the island; passes from the government authority were made necessary for entry. The authorities even invoked criminal provisions to restrain people from approaching the island. The trust sought help from the Waqf Board. When an inspection team visited the island, a newly constructed temple was found. The petition has also alleged that an idol was brought from the nearby Shiyal beyt. Later, the TCGL issued a tender notice for the development of the island as a tourist spot. This infuriated the trustees, who approached the HC against the “collusive attempt” and “conspiracy” by authorities to usurp the waqf property of the shrine against the provisions of law and “to create a non-existent issue”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/sawai-beyt-hc-moved-for-access-to-shrine/articleshow/81594530.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Housing board engineer held for taking bribe||JAIPUR: The Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) on Friday caught a housing board project engineer Vijay Kumar for taking a bribe of Rs 1 lakh. Kumar sought the bribe for clearing technical information in the ongoing bid of a project worth Rs 5.5 crore. Kumar’s job is to verify the technical details in the bids for major projects. ACB inspector Neeraj Bhardwaj said a contractor had lodged a complaint on March 10 against Kumar posted in the electric branch in the housing board. The complainant said that Kumar sought money for clearing technical information in his file for an upcoming coaching hub in Pratap Nagar. “Our team verified the claim made by the contractor based on the technical evidence collected by us,” said Bhardwaj. The contractor fixed the time with Kumar on Friday to hand over the money to him in the office. The ACB sleuths stood outside the office and waited for the signal from the contractor to nab Kumar red-handed with cash. “The ACB team caught him red-handed leaving him with the cash,” said the inspector, who started collecting evidence from his office by checking his laptop and files present in the office. The officials have found incriminating evidence against him from his laptop and files which would reveal his role in other cases also. Officials also noticed that the moment their presence had come to the light in the office, most of the employees left the office. “The act by the other employees put them under the suspicion. Also, the likelihood of the involvement of other employees in the bribery racket cannot be ruled out,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/housing-board-engineer-held-for-taking-bribe/articleshow/81593476.cms||---

Towards the end of last month, the Uttar Pradesh’s health department had made a week-long quarantine mandatory for symptomatic persons coming from states with high case count. Agra draws maximum number of foreign tourist among all the UP districts. And it is second to Prayagraj in wooing desi visitors. District magistrate (DM) Prabhu N Singh said, “To prevent spread of Covid-19 we have started screening people coming from other states. Arrangements have been made for 24-hour deployment of health workers for screening of passengers coming from other states at railway stations. All passengers coming by flight will have to undergo rapid antigen test. Samples of symptomatic people will be sent for RT-PCR test. Besides, they will have to stay in home isolation for at least seven days. Home isolation of one week will be mandatory for all people arriving from Maharashtra and Kerala.” “It is not possible for us to spot every person coming from other states. So, such people must report to the health department on their own and get themselves tested. People can also inform in case someone from other state has recently arrived in their neighborhood,” he said. Chief medical officer (CMO) of Agra, Dr RC Pandey, said, “Our special focus is on people returning from Maharashtra, Gujarat and Kerala. Covid-19 cases are rapidly increasing in these states. Our teams have started conducting rapid antigen tests of people returning from these states. Symptomatic people are being asked to remain in home isolation for at least seven days. Teams have also been tasked to conduct random sampling at different places.” The UP government had on Thursday released a fresh set of guidelines. It has directed all DMs to ensure testing people who are coming from high caseload areas/states. Gautam Buddh Nagar and Ghaziabad districts imposed section 144 in their bid to curb gathering.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/agra-starts-screening-travellers-from-maharashtra-kerala-gujarat-7-day-home-isolation-for-symptomatic/articleshow/81592810.cms||Deepak Lavania

When Mevani continued to speak despite being asked not to, speaker Trivedi summoned sergeants to evict him from the state assembly. “I have been suspended for the day from the Gujarat assembly for asking why the PSI has not been arrested in the Amrabhai Boricha murder case. I was evicted from the assembly on Thursday as well for making the same demand. Who is the Vijay Rupani government defending?” asked Mevani. Mevani said that Boricha (50) was attacked with spears, iron pipes and swords by upper caste members of Sanodar village. “Between 2009 and 2021, Amrabhai was attacked 13 times. People attempted to usurp his land and his residential plot. He was killed in the 14th attempt on his life because he was not given adequate police protection,” Mevani said. The independent MLA added that it has been 16 days since the police registered a case of dereliction of duty against a PSI, but he has not been arrested yet.

State education minister Arvind Pandey has ordered the officials to look into the possibilities of starting the academic year with as little delay as possible since the schools have been closed for a large part of the current academic year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The department was earlier planning to start the academic session from July 2021 but now it is looking at the possibilities of starting it from mid-April. If it plans to start the new session from April then the department might have to cancel the proposed home exams for non-board classes which were tentatively planned to be held between April and May 2021. The students of such classes will be evaluated on the basis of internal assessment exams being held in the ongoing academic year. Meanwhile, in a move to increase state control over the government-aided schools across Uttarakhand, the state education department has decided that the appointment of teachers will be done by the state selection commission. The appointments will be done either by the state public service commission or the subordinate service selection commission. The government claims that this move will bring in more transparency in the recruitment process of teachers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/state-govt-mulls-new-academic-session-from-april-15/articleshow/81593481.cms||Mohammad Anab

---||Hyderabad||Flyers faking reports? Many with -ve status from West Asia, UK test +ve at Hyderabad airport||HYDERABAD: Dozens of flyers from West Asia and some from UK carrying negative Covid-19 reports have tested positive on arrival in Hyderabad. Multiple such cases are being reported every day, sources at the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport (RGIA) said, hinting at the possibility of fake RT-PCR reports. There are about 70 weekly flight between Hyderabad and the two regions, majority to West Asia. “There have been many cases where passengers with negative reports were found to be positive when tested at the airport. As per protocol, their information has been shared with the state health department for contact tracing and quarantining,” Dr Anuradha Medoju, in-charge of the Airport Health Organisation for Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, told TOI. She added that data on total positive cases reported from RGIA recently wasn’t readily available for sharing with media, but all information was being shared with the government. According to the rulebook, all passengers arriving at any Indian airport from West Asia, Europe or the UK must undergo a Covid-19 test at the terminal even if they have taken the RT-PCR test before boarding. For passengers from other countries – most are from Maldives, Singapore and US – the test is not mandatory if they have a negative report taken within 72 hours prior to travel. There are no rules for domestic flyers, apart from those headed to Kolkata. These travellers have to carry a negative RT-PCR report. “It is highly probable that people are getting fake reports so that they are cleared to fly. Another possibility is the quick mutation of certain variants. In such cases, negative person might turn positive even within 72 hours. But chances of that are slim,” said another top official and expert on Covid management. Anu Acharya, CEO of Mapmygenome that does RT-PCR tests at RGIA, confirmed that testing has been ramped up at the airport. “We currently have a team of 55 working round the clock across five counters. It is a mammoth exercise,” she said. Multiple attempts to contact health department officials failed as calls and text messages went unanswered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/flyers-faking-reports-many-with-ve-status-from-west-asia-uk-test-ve-at-hyd-airport/articleshow/81596361.cms||Sudipta Sengupta
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Three arrested for ‘honey trap’ of web series maker||MUMBAI: An aspiring actress, a small-time television actor and a musician have been arrested in connection with the case where a web series maker was allegedly abducted in his own vehicle and Rs 1.6 lakh extorted from him earlier this month. Pant Nagar police, however, said they were still verifying how the sequence of events played out on the day of the abduction. Meanwhile, police are considering booking the web series maker on rape charges after the actress told doctors at a government hospital during a routine medical examination that she had been raped by him after being called for an audition. She added she was afraid to lodge a complaint as her parents had no clue about the incident. According to the 42-year-old web series maker’s complaint, he had auditioned the 24-year-old actress on March 6 for a role, after which they got intimate. But her boyfriend called him up later and accused him of exploiting her. He also threatened to file a complaint of rape against the series maker. On March 10, he was summoned to Ghatkopar and went in his car. Four people entered his vehicle, including the actress. At knifepoint, they allegedly forced him to drive from Ghatkopar to Wadala and further to Sion. Two of the accused snatched his phone and tried to transfer Rs 4 lakh from his account using a UPI-based payment app. But they were not well-versed with the app and ended up entering incorrect OTPs repeatedly. Eventually, they were able to transfer about Rs 1.4 lakh. They also forced the web series maker to withdraw Rs 20,000 from an ATM. Investigators are looking for independent witnesses and electronic surveillance footage. Police have learnt the web series maker had got a traffic challan that day and had also refuelled his vehicle as well as changed a flat tyre. “We are following the trail of money transfer from the web series maker’s bank account to that of the accused and checking whether it was further split among the rest of the accused,” said a senior police officer. The accused do not have a previous criminal record.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/three-arrested-for-honey-trap-of-web-series-maker-in-mumbai/articleshow/81595547.cms||Nitasha Natu

---||Mumbai||Mumbai:Student dupes picnickers with fake villa advts||Mumbai: A 21-year-old travel and tourism student was recently arrested from Pune city for allegedly creating a fake advertisement and duplicate ID with photographs of a 5-BHK Lake Mansion Villa at Pavana Lake in Lonavala online for primary homestays for vacation rentals and tourism activities, that offered high discounts and duped over dozen picnickers of over Rs1 lakh after making them pay in advance to book the villa, which belonged to a Powai businessman. Aakash Jadhawani, who is in judicial custody, confessed to the crime as he wanted to party with friends in resorts at Lonavala and Mahableshwar, and he purchased two high-end mobile phones and bought clothes. The newly-formed cyber crime unit in Bandra (W) said Jadhawani created advertisements for three bungalows and siphoned off over Rs 4 lakh this year. Jadhawani abused victims when they called, and threatened to “gangrape” family members if they called again. Jadhawani came across the villa on a Vista Villa website, owned and run by businessman Ashish Lonandkar (39). “Jadhawani created an advertisement on another travel website with hostname as Harsh and email ID of jadhawani.associates@gmail.com and accepted bookings after posting photos of Lonandkar’s bungalow. Lonandkar was unaware about the fraud till he got a call from Atul on February 2, about renting his bungalow at a low price,” said a police officer. Lonandkar, who owns the villa with a swimming pool, was shocked when he got calls from several people. “I feel sad for the victims but they should have paid money to the authorize website through which bookings are done, instead of an individual. Some people reached the villa and called me, saying they have booked it and made advance payments. After I got the calls, I went through the travel website and saw my bungalows photographs were fraudulently used,” Lonandkar told TOI. Lonandkar also got calls from picnickers Bhavesh Kotak who paid Rs16,500, Debashish Mandal paid Rs11,500 and Lipsa Patnaik paid Rs45,000. After repeated calls from victims, Lonandkar filed a complaint with Powai police on February 10. Jadhawani was arrested on March 15 after additional commissioner of police Sandip Karnik supervised DCP (zone IX) Abhishek Trimukhe, who led the team of senior inspector Savita Shinde, sub-inspector Vijay Vagare, constable Sangram Jadhav, and Powai inspector Vijay Dalvi, who tracked down Jadhawani to his Pune home. Shinde said Jadhawani was computer-savvy, while Dalvi said they recovered Rs73,000 from Jadhawani, who is from a well-to-do family and his father is into tours and travels.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaistudent-dupes-picnickers-with-fake-villa-advts/articleshow/81594614.cms||Narayan Namboodiri

They claim that the notices have been sent not only to the GST dealers who got registered recently, but also to the older ones. With a large section of businessmen affected by these notices, now the opposition parties too have trained their guns on the state government. Meanwhile, businessmen are also urging the government to ask the state taxation department to defer the notices and bring out one time settlement (OTS) or amnesty scheme to settle the professional tax dues without any penalty. District president of Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), Ranjit Singh Dhillon said, “Notices to businessmen to pay professional tax is a mischievous act by the state taxation department. Was the department sleeping for three years since the professional tax made applicable in the state? Secondly, why no camps or awareness drives were organised by the department to register the tax payers? Now, they have been issued notices under which they will have to pay penalty of Rs 50,000, as they have been declared wilful defaulter. In the first place, this tax should not have been imposed and now government has given a free hand to the taxation department to harass innocent people on pretext of these notices. We are also exploring legal recourse against this.” Jaswinder Singh Thukral, president of Janta Nagar Small Scale Manufacturers Association, said, “State taxation department is least bothered about the plight of businessmen but only wants to fill its coffers by extorting money from us on one pretext or another. In this case too, the yearly tax is Rs 2,400 but penalty is Rs 50,000. We never got any notice during the last three years and now all of sudden show cause notices have been slapped on us asking us or our authorised representatives to appear before the official concerned. We are going to take this matter up with chief minister Amarinder Singh and urge him to order the department to introduce one-time settlement scheme for settling the professional tax dues without payment of any late fee or penalty.” According to city-based chartered accountant Ankur Gupta, “Almost every client of ours, whether registered with GST last year or before that has received this show cause notice under Section 6 of Punjab State Development Tax (PSDT) Act for wilfully failing to apply for registration and also holding him liable to penalty under sub-section (1) of Section 19 of the Act. These notices are making matters worse for us already there is huge workload of GST returns and ITR returns on us and the assessees as well in wake of the closing date of financial year approaching near.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/bizmen-say-sudden-issue-of-professional-tax-notices-unfair-demand-amnesty-scheme/articleshow/81593515.cms||Mohit Behl

---||Ahmedabad||BJP, Cong lock horns over tur dal||Gandhinagar: BJP and Congress MLAs were involved in a heated discussion in the state assembly on Friday over the rate at which the Gujarat State Civil Supplies Corporation purchases tur dal and sells it to ration card holders through the public distribution system. Quoting a February 2021 resolution of the corporation, Congress MLAs said that the corporation had fixed the purchase price of tur dal at Rs 39 per kg, but ration card holders were being provided tur dal at Rs 61 per kg. Congress MLAs alleged that irregularities were being done in purchase and sale of tur dal. When Congress MLAs continued to raise the issue even after minister Jayesh Radadiya clarified that tur dal was being purchased at Rs 91 per kg and the state government was bearing a subsidy of Rs 30 per kg, CM Vijay Rupani intervened in the discussion. Angered over Congress MLAs unwillingness to accept the minister’s answer, Rupani remarked, “Congress MLAs are making baseless allegations. Tur dal is not available anywhere for Rs 39 a kg. They should be reprimanded.” Leader of Opposition Paresh Dhanani sought to know that when tur with pods is being sold at APMCs for about Rs 55 for a kg, why was it that tur dal costed over Rs 90 a kg. Several MLAs then got up and began speaking out of turn. The Speaker first asked them to be seated, but when they did not relent, he asked BJP MLA Shashikant Pandya and Congress MLA Rutvik Makwana to leave the assembly for the remainder of the question hour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/bjp-cong-lock-horns-over-tur-dal/articleshow/81594607.cms||---

Justice Indrajeet Singh allowed the accused bail as the chargesheet in the case has been filed. The court had earlier granted interim bail for ten days from February 10 for the marriage of the accused. The state government counsel while objecting to grant her bail had said during the last hearing that the court granted interim bail for her marriage. The government counsel said the ACB has a transcript of the conversation of the accused in which she is talking to the employee of the complainant company. Therefore, the bail application of the accused officer should be rejected. ACB arrested Pinky Meena, the then SDM of Bandikui, on January 13 for demanding a bribe of Rs 10 lakh.

Abhishek Baghel’s body was found barely half-an-hour after CP Amitesh Kumar broadcast a message to trace him, after family members approached him. The cellphone and purse of the victim are yet to be recovered. Even as the family members were discussing the issue with the CP, the boy’s body was found in the parking lot of the mall, which had been closed since the extended restrictions were announced this week. The family had collapsed in grief at the office of the CP itself, it’s learnt. Abhishek, who owned a mobile shop, had left home at Wathoda on Wednesday at 10pm, taking Rs 100 from his mother, on the pretext of purchasing medicine for his migraine. He had answered a call from the family once. Then, someone informed them from his cellphone shortly after midnight that he was near Krazy Castle, at Ambazari, but not in a position to move. The phone was later switched off. Police said Abhishek was spotted in the CCTVs moving towards Variety Square and then Jhansi Rani Square just after midnight on Wednesday. He appears to have tried to drive down the slope of the parking lot in the mall. Cops said Abhishek likely rammed into a wall and then also hit a pillar before falling down. The bike was found on the ground near him in a damaged condition. Dhantoli police have registered a case of accidental death. In another incident, one Raj Kabra was killed in a group clash at Shramik Nagar in Parsodi on Thursday. It’s learnt two groups had started fighting after Kabra’s friend Lala Patle was forced to consume liquor by Ajay Borge, Amit Borge and others. An injured Kabra was rushed to hospital, where he had been declared dead. At least three more were injured.

Before the pandemic, there were a total of 190 express trains being operated. These trains were run daily, twice or thrice a week,” said an SCR official. Apart from Vishakapatnam and Guntur, passengers can also travel to places like Renigunta, Vijayawada, Nanded, Adilabad, Yeshwantpur, Sainagar Shirdi, Aurangabad, H Nizamuddin, Santragachi and Shri Ganganagar from the zone once the services are resumed. On the other hand, two special trains, notified earlier to run between Hyderabad and Hadapsar, tri-weekly express (train numbers 07014/07013) from April 1 onwards have been cancelled due to operational reasons.

---||Hyderabad||TRS sitting pretty after elimination stage in MLC polls||HYDERABAD: The marathon counting of two graduates MLC constituencies elections in Telangana reached the elimination stage on Friday with the authorities taking up counting of second preferential votes. Election authorities said the results are likely on Saturday. None of the MLC candidates got the required winning 50% plus one vote in the first preferential vote at the end of seven rounds in each constituency. Telangana chief electoral officer Shashank Goel told TOI, “Counting is continuing as per the procedure. We may expect final results by Saturday.” While all the parties are keeping their fingers crossed, the ruling TRS can breathe easy as its candidates — Palla Rajeshwar Reddy in Warangal-Khammam-Nalgonda (WKN) and Surabhi Vani Devi in Hyderabad-Rangareddy-Mahbubnagar (HRM) seats — continued to maintain a lead even in the elimination stage. Rajeshwar Reddy established a decent lead of 27,550 votes in the first preferential vote. In the elimination process after 55 candidates were eliminated, another 316 votes were added to his tally till last reports came in. Vani Devi secured a lead of 8,021 votes, while her BJP rival, sitting MLC N Ramchander Rao, is trailing her closely. After the elimination process, 40 candidates got eliminated and Vani Devi got a boost in the form of another 163 second preference votes added to her tally. Rajeswar Reddy got 30.2% vote share followed by independent Teenmar Mallanna 22.7%, TJS candidate professor M Kodandaram 19.1%, BJP’s G Premender Reddy 10.6% and Congress’ Ramulu Naik polled 7.5%. Independents and smaller party candidates like Jayasaradhi Reddy, Cheruku Sudhakar and Rani Rudrama Reddy got around 2-2.5% each. Mallanna and Kodandaram will have to get more preferential votes if they were to be in the driver’s seat and overtake the leads Rajeshwar Reddy had obtained in the first preference votes. However, going by the early trends in the elimination process, the TRS candidate is sitting pretty as he continued to get second preferential votes on a par with Mallanna and Kondandaram. Poll expert Rakesh Reddy Dubbudu of Factly said that at the end of the elimination process, if the last two top candidates fail to get 50% plus one, then one of the two having more number of votes will be declared elected. “As the percentage of votes obtained in the first preference vote is far from 50% plus one vote by all candidates, including Rajeshwar Reddy, it is unlikely that any of the three leading candidates will get 50% vote share in the elimination state,” he explained. Usually, half of the voters may have voted only for first preference. In HRM seat, Vani Devi got 33.4% in the first preference votes, Ramchander 31%, independent professor K Nageshwar 16% and Congress’ G Chinna Reddy 9.3%. Independent Harshavardhan Reddy got 3%, while TDP’s L Ramana secured just 1.7% vote. In this case, whoever voted first preference for Chinna Reddy and Nageshwar has voted second preference for whom will decide the winner. Experts said it is unlikely that those who voted for Nageshwar with Left allegiance and Chinna Reddy would have voted for the BJP in the second preference votes. “The TRS candidate will be at an advantage due to this situation as she continues to get second preference votes on a par with Ramchander during the initial elimination,” an expert reasoned. Rakesh Reddy said there is every likelihood of Vani Devi or Ramchander getting 50% plus one vote as they have got good percentage of votes in the first preference vote as there are lesser candidates with high votes at the top unlike in WKN constituency. “Even if the lead candidate doesn’t get 50% plus one votes, the one on the top in the final two will be declared the winner,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trs-sitting-pretty-after-elimination-stage-in-mlc-polls/articleshow/81596365.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

Though the Kerala Congress of P C Thomas is recognized by the EC, they were not allotted any symbol this time as Thomas did not apply for one. Thomas has now requested the commission to consider one among the three symbols which they have chosen.  While, a farmer driving a tractor is their, first choice, a coconut grove and football are their other choices. The party is hoping that there won’t be any problem in issuing a common symbol for all its 10 candidates. Meanwhile, P J Joseph and Monce Joseph resigned as MLAs to avoid disqualification.  They tendered their resignation based on a legal opinion that as they had contested under the label of Kerala Congress (M) the previous time there were possibilities of them getting disqualified if they contest for another party without severing ties with the former party. Both filed their respective nominations after sending their resignation letters as MLAs to the assembly speaker.

The girl’s kin said that she had gone to relieve herself around 2 pm, and when she did not return, her family started looking for her.

---||Vijayawada||19-year-old held for sodomising, killing 2 boys, aged 6 & 8, in Andhra Pradesh||VIJAYAWADA: A 19-year-old youth allegedly sodomised and killed two boys — aged six and eight — before surrendering at the local village revenue office late on Thursday. The killings happened over a period of one month at Mellampudi village in Tadepalli in Guntur district. The accused, Mellampudi Gopi, is a native of same village. Guntur urban SP R N Ammi Reddy said Tadepalli police had received a complaint on March 14 about a six-year-old boy missing. Two days later, the child’s decomposed body was found in a guava orchard with his limbs broken. A preliminary post-mortem report indicated he was sodomised and beaten to death. The boy’s family members told the police they suspected Gopi. When police interrogated Gopi after his surrender, he admitted to forcibly taking the boy to a trench near the orchard where he tried to sodomise the boy using a contraceptive. When the boy started screaming, Gopi thrashed him brutally, broke his hands and legs, and strangulated the six-year-old.  After the boy’s death, Gopi allegedly indulged in necrophilia before dumping his body in the bushes. Gopi also confessed to the police that he had killed another eight-year-old boy in a similar manner about a month ago. The earlier crime, SP Ammi Reddy said, happened on February 11 when Gopi lured the boy by offering him chocolate. He later threw the body into Buckingham canal which was retrieved by cops days later. Police said both cases were connected and had formed special teams to nab Gopi after the boy’s parents named him. He has been booked for murder under relevant sections of POCSO Act. The accused was produced before a court on Friday which remanded him in judicial custody. Gopi’s father Srinivas Rao too has a criminal history, police said. Rao allegedly murdered his first wife by setting her ablaze over an extramarital dispute and served a 14-year jail sentence at Rajahmundry prison. After his release, he married another woman, from whom Gopi was born. Gopi started fending for himself from an early age by doing odd jobs before getting the job of a helper at a tent house in Mellampudi village. He also got addicted to liquor and sex and used to regularly visit a brothel near the railway station, police said. Later he got introduced to a middle-aged man in his village with whom he shared a homosexual relationship, police said. He told us he committed the crime because he wasn’t ‘satisfied’ with elderly people and always fantasized little children, a police officer present during his interrogation said. About two years ago, a minor boy from the same village went missing, and locals suspected Gopi as he was last seen going into a movie theatre with the boy. Strangely enough, the victim’s family members did not lodge a complaint with the police due to which the case remained under wraps. Police said the two-year-old incident was one reason why they suspected Gopi could be behind the recent killings. They said they will now investigate the two-year old missing case to check if Gopi was involved in it.

A division bench of made strong observations against the officials saying that they are behaving inhumanly. “In the new GST raj which replaced the old Central Excise Act’s licence raj, the officials are proving to be worse than police sub-inspectors in a rural police station,” it said and stopped proceedings against petitioner J Sridhar Reddy, proprietor of Bharani Commodities and Hyderabad Steels. The petitioner also charged GST officials — C Sudha Rani and B Srinivasa Gandhi — with demanding Rs 5 crore as bribe to get him out of the case. The bench of Justice MS Ramachandra Rao and Justice T Vinod Kumar issued notices to them along with other officials and sought to know from them why their orders were cryptic without any proper explanation for filing the case against Sridhar. “This is contrary to the Supreme Court order and hence comes under contempt,” it said. The GST department argued that the two private firms owed Rs 8.5 crore GST dues and the officials are proceeding as per law. Sridhar Reddy, however, said the officials raided his house and detained his wife in the GST office for an entire day when he was not in the country. Petitioner’s counsel Vedula Srinivas said: “The GST officials said that some third parties had deposed against us. This was shown as the basis for case against us. What we are seeking is to allow us to cross-examine them as per the guidelines issued by the Supreme Court.” “Since the GST officials have rejected our request and are going against us unilaterally, we are praying before this court,” Srinivas said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-pans-gst-officials-issues-them-notice/articleshow/81594639.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

While authorities say that the spike in Covid cases will continue till June, active vaccination is the best weapon in the state and in the country looking at how social distancing rules are being ignored “The government is also probably looking at possibilities that the best way to end the pandemic is vaccination. Currently, we are doing around 30,000 vaccinations daily in the state, it should be around 50,000 daily, ” Dr G Srinivasa Rao, director of public health, Telangana, said However, he said the current increase in Covid cases is still under control but if residents ignore the social distancing rules, the satiation will be alarming. Officials said currently there is no plan to impose any restrictions or semi-lockdown in the state. “People have to move on with their life, thinking that the virus will be part of life, with proper Covid-19 protocols in place,” they said. The health department even made arrangements to conduct the vaccination programme in the mandal level. In the country, daily 30 lakh people are being vaccinated currently, which should be around 50 lakh, officials said.. Though the response from the people in general is better than the healthcare workers and government staff in the state, people still have fears over the vaccine, say officials. Till March 18, 8.7 lakh people have received vaccine. A total of 3,73,632 healthcare workers and 1,61,797 frontline workers were administered the vaccine in the state up to March 18. Meanwhile, Union home ministry has written to all states asking them to keep in mind the surge in Covid-19 cases all over the country. The home ministry said that states should take up awareness measures to spread the message among the people so they understand the necessity of wearing masks, hand washing and maintaining social distance again.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-asks-centre-to-open-up-vax-to-all-sections/articleshow/81594682.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

However, the teaching-learning remained affected. In majority of the primary schools in Agra district, the attendance of students has not exceeded 50 percent in the past three weeks. Teachers believe that the state government’s decision of promoting students without examination is one of the reasons for low attendance. The primary schools in UP are following the alternate day roster plan for students attending the classes. For example, students of Class 1 are required to come to school on Monday and Wednesday. And students of Class 2 on Tuesday and Thursday. Student of each class is required to come to school for three days in a week. District president of primary teachers’ association Brajesh Dixit said, “There are around 2,800 primary schools in the district. The attendance in any of these schools has not exceeded 50 percent ever since the schools reopened. The state government has taken the decision to promote the students without examination. Besides, the roster plan for attending classes is a reason behind low attendance. Parents are also not interested in sending kids to school.” Basic Shiksha Adhikari Rajeev Kumar said, “Following the state government orders, regular classes are taking place as per the roster plan. The attendance of students is low in majority of the schools. The state directives mention that students cannot be mandated to come to school.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/attendance-in-primary-schools-remains-less-than-50-percent/articleshow/81592837.cms||---

The truth is that in 1996-97, when the Congress-backed government of Shankersinh Vaghela ended, there were 5.51 lakh government employees. Today, the number of government employees stands at 4.91 lakh,” Chavda said.He added that over the years, government employees – right from the CS to class IV employees – have retired. “If the government had appointed more persons than those who retired over the past 25 years, the figure would have been more than 5.51 lakh,” he said.Chavda added that the present government is not functioning with lesser employees. “The practice of outsourcing has become rampant. It is being done because the government’s network of recruiting persons is completely flawed,” Chavda said.Speaking about class IV appointments, Chavda said that for more than two decades, there have been no permanent appointments by the government. “Youth of poor families, scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and others are not getting government jobs despite being educated,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/outsourcing-depriving-youth-of-permanent-govt-jobs/articleshow/81594684.cms||---

Talking to TOI on Friday, Pakistan’s Hindu Member National Assembly (MNA) Ramesh Kumar Vankwani said Pooja Meghwar was allegedly abducted from Husri town of Hyderabad district of Sindh province of Pakistan. “We have got an FIR registered, but the facts would be revealed only after Pooja is rescued by police,” said the MNA. Sources said Pooja’s father Chetan Meghwar, a textile mill worker, tried to lodge a complaint about the abduction of her daughter, but police didn’t listen to him. The FIR was registered only after the intervention of Hindu politicians, they added. Earlier, two minor girls Aarti Meghwar, a resident of Dharki, and Kavita Odh, a resident of Tangwani, and Reena Meghwar of Dadu had been allegedly abducted and converted to Islam. Kavita, 13, was forcibly converted to Islam when the Hindu community in Pakistan was celebrating Maha Shivratri on March 11. “Living in Sindh has become a nightmare, every second day our daughters and sisters are kidnapped, forced to embrace Islam and marry elderly or very poor Muslims. And the government does nothing other than watching every incident like a mute spectator and even trying to hide such incidents from the media,” said a Hindu resident of Karachi who didn’t wish to give his name. Vankwani said so far, no one had approached Pakistan Hindu Council (PHC) to hold a meeting with the girl or her parents as mutually agreed between PHC and Islamist clerics Pir Mohammad Ayub Jan Sarhani, Mian Mitha in the recent past.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/another-hindu-girl-converted-in-pak/articleshow/81594690.cms||Yudhvir Rana
---||Chandigarh||Walk the talk: Capt tells Pak’s Gen Bajwa||Chandigarh: Terming Islamabad-sponsored terrorism as the biggest hurdle to normalising relations between the two nations, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Friday said Pakistan’s Chief of Army Staff General Qamar Javed Bajwa should back his rhetoric on peace with India with solid action. Bajwa should first control his ISI, and then talk about stability in Indo-Pak relations, said the chief minister, adding that India cannot afford to go soft with Pakistan till they walk the talk and prove their sincerity with concrete actions. “Infiltration into India from across the border is still happening, Indian soldiers are being killed at the borders every day. They (Pakistan) are dropping arms and heroin into Punjab via drones every other day. Efforts to create trouble in my state continue to take place. All this should stop first, only then we can talk peace,” said Captain Amarinder. For India to trust Pakistan, the latter would have to do much more than offer an olive branch, said the chief minister, citing his own experience of 1964 as ADC to GOC-in-C, Western Command. “We used to receive daily reports of firing and trouble from the western border, as we continue to do now,” he said. It is important for not just Bajwa but the entire Pakistan military apparatus to be on board with the idea of burying the past and paving the way for peace with India, said Capt Amarinder, adding that it was not New Delhi but Islamabad which had obstructed the path of peace between the two countries. “Are they all of the same view as shared by General Bajwa? Are they withdrawing all support to terror groups immediately? Have they asked ISI to back off and leave India alone?” These, said the chief minister, were the questions that needed to be answered before India could start believing in and responding to Pakistan’s overtures of peace. “India is all for peace, all Indians stand for peace, but India cannot compromise on its security and integrity,” he stressed, adding that peace cannot be conditional. Given the way the situation has evolved, Pakistan’s increasing collusion with China, which had been causing a whole lot of trouble for India on the other border, was a matter of concern, Amarinder said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/walk-the-talk-capt-tells-paks-gen-bajwa/articleshow/81594687.cms||---

During the state-wide lockdown last year, there were protests across the state, especially in rural areas over the quality of food grains being made available through fair price shops under the PDS.

The petitioners have sought documents submitted before the commission by other parties. They say their requests are meant to enable them to assist the panel in its inquiry. However, Justice Mehta rejected their requests and they approached the high court.After hearing the relatives’ advocate Percy Kavina, Justice V M Pancholi issued a notice to the state government and the secretary of the commission and sought a reply by April 6. The court sought a view on whether the commission should permit the kin of the victims to visit the ICU of the sealed Shrey Hospital with a photographer and whether documents should be provided to them. The HC observed that the earlier head of this inquiry commission, Justice (retired) K A Puj, had parted with documents when the relatives of the victims requested for them. The judge observed that the petitioners are not strangers and as relatives of the victims, their petition cannot be rejected straightaway as demanded by the state government.Eight Covid-19 patients lost their lives in the fire at Shrey Hospital and five persons died in Rajkot’s Covid hospital in August last year.The HC noted that the commission had observed that it was nothing but a “dilatory tactic for a fishing and roving inquiry” adopted by the relatives. The HC said, “Prima facie, this court is of the view that the petitioners are affected persons and their near relatives died in the unfortunate incident, which has taken place at Shrey Hospital.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/shrey-fire-hc-notice-on-kins-request-for-information/articleshow/81594713.cms||---

Her instant decision came when the compere at the bike rally welcomed her in English to which she objected and enquired if the compere can speak in Hindi. After this, the event organisers changed the compere and proceeded with the event in Hindi. Maurya and state forest minister Harak Singh Rawat were the chief guests of the bike rally that was flagged off from Raj Bhawan. As the two took to stage with Neha Sharma, director of Trikon Society, the NGO that had organised the event, the compere started the proceedings by saying, “We welcome you governor ma’am to today’s event…”. Before the compere could finish her lines, Maurya objected to the use of English and interjected, “Yeh angrezi mein kyon kar rahi hain baat, Hindi mein karein (Why are you speaking in English? Speak in Hindi).” As the compere fumbled with the interruption, Neha Sharma took the mike and started the event by greeting everyone present in Hindi. Maurya, during her speech, too, stressed on the use of Hindi pointing out that “countries like Japan and China were successful as people of these countries did not feel ashamed of their mother tongue.” “Kerela has 100% women literacy because there, the people are being taught in their mother tongue. If we, the north Indian people, have Hindi as our mother tongue, then we must speak Hindi with pride. Even if foreigners come, we must speak in Hindi as they should know that we respect our mother tongue.” She added that “even though I know a bit of English myself — as mayor of Agra, I have visited 10-15 countries — I have learnt to respect the mother tongue.” “I am announcing today that all events in Raj Bhawan will henceforth take place in Hindi. Speeches and compering in English will not be allowed,” said Maurya who added that “Hindi’s use should be encouraged as it is a language that touches the heart.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-governor-stops-comperes-introduction-in-english-at-event-says-feel-proud-of-your-mother-tongue-announces-that-henceforth-all-events-in-raj-bhawan-will-be-conducted-in-hindi/articleshow/81593579.cms||Ishita Mishra

He said he is "not against jeans but just ripped jeans". He added: “I am not against people wearing clothes of their choice. I, too, have a daughter. But while clothing is an individual choice, people should respect their culture and traditions … We have examples like Rani Laxmi Bai, who fought battles in a sari.” On Tuesday, Rawat had associated ripped jeans with societal collapse and expressed “shock” at a “mother” who wore frayed denim. For two days since, protests kept raging both on the ground and online, with #RippedJeans and #RippedJeansTwitter trending and sweeping Twitter with over 1 lakh mentions on Thursday. On Friday, he said there was a context to what he had said: “The statement was made as a father. The event where I said that was about women and children. I said that since a student is at school for five to six hours and spends most of the time at home, traditions and values can be inculcated better at home.” He also stood by his objections though. “As children, when our trousers were torn, we would put a patch over the tear so the teacher would not reprimand us in school. Now, children are deliberately cutting their trousers with scissors, which should not happen,” he added, reiterating what he had said on Tuesday at the Uttarakhand State Commission for Protection of Child Rights workshop on substance abuse. As the backlash mounted, the chief minister’s wife Rashmi Tyagi Rawat came to her husband’s defence. “The statement has been twisted to paint the whole episode in a wrong colour,” she told TOI. “He is a very progressive man. It was because of his approach that I excelled in my career.” Rashmi Rawat, who teaches at DAV PG College in Dehradun, said there are many “positive things” he has already done for the state and this is a “conspiracy” to distract. She added that his statements meant to impart wisdom about culture. “The CM was telling kids about our culture and tradition to motivate them and take pride in their Indian identity. He just gave an example and it was blown out of proportion."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/not-against-jeans-only-ripped-jeans-says-ukhand-cm-amid-furore/articleshow/81593577.cms||Kautilya Singh

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Two students test +ve at Osmania University girls hostel||HYDERABAD: Two Osmania University (OU) students tested positive for Covid-19 during the screening for Covid held in girls hostel on Thursday. Last week, two boys tested positive in the NRS boys hostel at OU. All the students have been isolated by the varsity as the administration is making arrangements to screen the remaining boarders. A month after students resumed physical classes, universities and colleges have ramped up Covid-19 testing within their premises after a few isolated positive cases have been reported. Rise in Covid-19 cases across the state, especially in residential schools, has prompted universities and colleges to test all students in hostels. While RT-PCR tests were being conducted in boys hostel, the OU administration extended the testing facility even to four girls hostels which houses close to 700 students. “When the students had joined the hostels a month ago, we had asked them to get a negative Covid-19 report. Now, we have decided to test all the students to be on the safe side,” said Nirmala Devi, chief warden, girls hostel, OU. Even at Nizam College, the administration has decided to ramp up testing for all students. “We have 320 students in two boys hostels. While we have not had any positive cases so far, we have asked the state health department to conduct RT-PCR testing of all students,” said Prof Laxmikanth Rathod, principal, Nizam College. Many other institutions such as Gitam University are conducting RT-PCR tests for students having any symptoms. Others such as the English and Foreign Languages University, Hyderabad have decided to keep the varsity shut until March 31 fearing rise in Covid-19 cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/2-students-test-ve-at-ou-girls-hostel/articleshow/81594719.cms||---

The incident sparked tension after his relatives and supporters raised doubts about the way the body was found. They refused to accept that he may have ended his own life. The 38-year-old deceased has been identified as Sunil Khajindar. He was also the Shiv Sena deputy taluka chief. Khajindar was to get married in April. There have been allegations that the woman (in whose house his body was found) was threatening to go public with their illicit relationship. The house was said to be locked from the outside, when Khajindar reportedly hung himself using a metal chain. However, his body was found with the knees still touching the wooden cot — raising questions over the suicide theory. On Friday morning, his family members and hundreds of supporters took his body to the police station demanding action against the woman. After failing to get a satisfactory response, a group of angry supporters, led by former MP Chandrakant Khaire, blocked the Daulatabad road for about five hours. Senior police officers went to the spot to diffuse the situation. Deputy commissioner of police (zone-I) Nikesh Khatmode-Patil finally convinced the supporters to take the body and perform the last rites . The police have registering a case of abetment of suicide against the woman and have arrested her.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/panchayat-member-found-dead-at-womans-home/articleshow/81592384.cms||---
---||Delhi||4 who leaked test papers for jobs, univ seats held||New Delhi: Four people have been arrested from Delhi and Haryana for leaking entrance examination papers of government jobs and private university seats. The main accused, Vaishali, also bribed officials at the exam centres to provide the question papers. She posed as a woman IPS officer and met various victims promising them jobs. The gang would offer students jobs and university seats for Rs 20 lakh per candidate. The accused used applications to leak online paper before the exam or would send fake candidates, who would leak the answers to others. The four accused have been identified as Rohit (23), Love Kumar (26), Himanshu (23) and Vaishali (26) — all residents of Haryana. Police said they received information about some illegal practice being going on at Om and Chander Associates Examination Centre in Naraina Industrial Area during the test for the post of forest guard. On February 4, a police team conducted a raid at the centre and nabbed Rohit, who was using a mobile phone for solving the online paper. Thereafter, a case was registered at Naraina police station. During investigation, WhatsApp data of the seized mobile phone was retrieved and analysed, following which three more people were arrested. “During interrogation the accused revealed that Vaishali was the kingpin. She, along with her boyfriend Anil Sharma, brother Love and other associates, ran the racket” said DCP (West) Urvija Goel. The gang operated in various states, including Haryana, Rajasthan, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi, particularly in rural areas, she added. Two uniforms of Delhi Police were also recovered from them. Vaishali used to pose as an IPS officer and two of her associates posed as sub-inspector and head constable to impress people. The gang members charged around Rs 10-25 lakh, depending on the nature of the job. Usually, an employee of a private examination centre helped to provide a mobile phone to their candidate. The dummy candidate used to send a picture of the paper to the kingpin. Then the “solvers” answered the paper within a few minutes and circulated the answer-key to their centres in different states. The bank statement of accused revealed heavy cash transactions in 2021. Efforts are being made to nab their associates. Links of candidates who have cleared the examination by unfair means with the help of the gang are also being investigated, a senior officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/4-who-leaked-test-papers-for-jobs-univ-seats-held/articleshow/81609231.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Delhi||Lockdown in Delhi gave wing to sparrows||NEW DELHI: Once commonly seen nesting among the city’s buildings, the house sparrow, Delhi’s state bird, is rarely seen in urban spaces now. But on World Sparrow Day on Saturday, the good news is the acknowledgement that their numbers have gone up. While there were more of the birds observed on the outskirts of the capital, experts believe the lockdown may have played a vital role in helping their population rise even in urban locations. The proliferation of the blue rock pigeon in urban areas, reduction of green spaces and change in the architectural style are considered some of the major reasons why the sparrow population declined in Delhi over the years. Experts pointed out how the human-dependent lineage of the house sparrow was clear, because of which man-made changes in and around their habitats have impacted their existence. “The lack of nesting space coupled with the loss of native grasses and their native insect herbivory made the house sparrow vanish from urban settlements,” noted Faiyaz Khudsar, scientist in charge, Yamuna Biodiversity Park. But Khudsar was happy that the Covid lockdown helped a number of bird species by curbing noise pollution. “You could hear birds such as the sparrow chirp all day and their vocalisation was helped in the quietness created by the lockdown. A dedicated census of sparrows will help Delhi understand the overall trend in their numbers,” he added. Rakesh Khatri, an environmentalist who conducted a workshop on Saturday during which he taught children how to make nests to attract sparrows back to urban houses, felt the lockdown had a positive impact on the sparrow count. Khatri, considered the ‘sparrow man of India’, has built over 35,000 nests for sparrows over the years. Khatri told TOI, “During the lockdown, in Mayur Vihar Phase III, where I live, we saw bird species not seen normally. Sparrows too were sighted in greater numbers. The lockdown conditions were ideal for them and they started coming closer to human settlements again.” Khatri said locations such as Mayur Vihar Phase I and III, Sarojini Nagar, Ashok Nagar, Dilshad Garden, Rohini Sector 24, Sanjay Lake and Dwarka were areas where sparrow populations showed an increase. “We have been placing nests in housing colonies and other place in these areas and we have recorded a distinct increase in numbers there,” said Khatri, adding that locations like Vijay Nagar and Jorbagh had seen a slight decline. Nidhi Gupta, resident of the Air Force and Naval Officers Enclave in Dwarka Sector 7, celebrated World Sparrow Day by making nests for the birds along with over 30 children. “Sparrows still live in Delhi, but aren’t seen near our houses,” said Gupta. “This is an effort to educate children about them and teach them ways to help the birds co-exist with humans.” M Shah Hussain, scientist in charge, Aravalli Biodiversity Park, Vasant Kunj, said the nature reserve had a dedicated area for sparrows. “Sparrows prefer areas that are close to humans, but with plenty of green spaces and open areas around,” explained Hussain. “Weeds and tall grasses are also beneficial. With their habitats undisturbed during the lockdown last summer, the biodiversity park was an ideal nesting location for them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/lockdown-gave-wing-to-sparrows/articleshow/81609246.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

They are requested to make special arrangements to facilitate eligible category among their policyholders to get vaccinated as a group or individually either at a government facility or private facilities…,” IRDAI said in a communication to insurance players. The insurers have been told to publicise the process of registration for vaccination programmes and create awareness via SMS as well as emails. Secondly, the insurance regulator said asked insurers to help policyholders get vaccinated by making advanced arrangements through pre-booking slots. It has also asked them to give a reminder to policyholders about the second shot. S Prakash, MD, Star Health and Allied Insurance Co Ltd, said the latest move by IRDAI is aimed at helping people shed vaccine hesitancy as this is the first-time an adult vaccination drive is being carried out on a mass scale in the country. Terming it as a pro-customer move, Amit Chhabra, head-health insurance, Policybazaar.com, that with this awareness campaign more people will understand the importance of taking the vaccine without worrying about its after-effects as their insurer would be there to cover the cost of hospitalisation. However, he pointed out that insurers have not been directed to cover the cost of vaccination. While vaccination is free of cost in government hospitals, in private hospitals the government has issued a cap of Rs 250 per dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/assist-policyholders-in-getting-covid-jab-irdai/articleshow/81594730.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: New to locality, man denied burial||HYDERABAD: A man was not allowed to be buried in the Muslim graveyard at Kismatpur under Rajendernagar police station limits, for being new to the locality. The matter came to light when the relatives sought the intervention of Telangana State Waqf Board (TSWB). Despite the board’s intervention, the graveyard committee refused to allow the man to be buried. Syed Yousuf, a resident of Kismatpur, died at his residence on March 18. He had shifted to the locality eight months ago. Based on the fact that he had not lived in the area for long, the graveyard committee allegedly refused to allow Syed Yousuf to be buried in the graveyard. “Kismatpura Graveyard Committee members sent my brother and relatives back and told us to take my father body to where we had shifted from recently. We are new in this area, on the basis of which my father is not getting a place to be buried,” the deceased’s daughter said. When contacted, Mohammed Saleem, chairman, TSWB, confirmed that the incident took place in the locality and they had taken cognisance of the matter and filed a police complaint against the caretakers of the committee. “We have taken the matter seriously and sent our people to help out the relatives in the matter. Whoever it be, will have to face stern action and such people will not spared at all,” Saleem told TOI. He added that TSWB would take the matter seriously and the tainted persons would be removed forthwith. On May 29, 2020, Mohammed Khaja Miyan (55) was not allowed to be buried at a Muslim graveyard and was eventually buried in a Hindu graveyard. A relative of Syed Yousuf rued: “I was made to go from one place to another for hours. No one came forward to listen to us. I even went to the police station, but nothing was done.” K. KanaKaiah, inspector, rajendarnagar police, told TOI that no complaint had been lodged in this regard, and relatives had only informed them of the the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/new-to-locality-man-denied-burial/articleshow/81594726.cms||Omar bin Taher

The bus service between Maharashtra and Karnataka stood cancelled for over a week due to tensions between pro-Kannada and pro-Marathi groups in the border areas especially in Belagavi (Karanataka) and Kolhapur (Maharashtra). Rohan Palange, the divisional controller of MSRTC, said, “We have resumed the service between the two cities with seven buses. No untoward incident was reported on the first day of the service resumption. In a phased manner, we will roll out all the 30 buses from Kolhapur depot to Karanataka. The local service to small towns on either side of the border will continue.” Karanataka has already resumed long-route buses to cities in Maharashtra, but the Karanataka State Road Transport Corporation buses are not allowed to Kolhapur depot due to security concerns. Though the MSRTC officials said the buses will be rolled in a phased manner, a break may occur on Saturday as Shiv Sena is going to agitate against Karanataka government’s failure to remove Kannada flag illegally hoisted outside Belagavi City Corporation building in December. Meanwhile, Kolhapur Chamber of Commerce and Industries (KCCI) have appealed to the Kannada traders and businessmen in Kolhapur to keep their establishments shut for a day on Saturday. Sanjay Shete, president of KCCI, said, “We are aware that there can be violent protests against Kannada people staying in Kolhapur district. Therefore to ensure that no untoward incident take place on Saturday, we have appealed tothe Kannada people to shut their businesses for one day.

A bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni on Friday asked the new PIL petitioner if he supported the Centre’s stand against the state. The Centre’s stand is that the land is theirs and the state could not have last year transferred it to MMRDA for the car shed. Appearing for Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMR-DA), senior counsel Darius Khambata said if the Kanjurmarg land was found belonging to the Centre, they will be entitled to compensation and its concern for compensation was understandable, but its keenness to decide where the Metro car depot is to be built, was not. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/metro-car-shed-pleas-hearing-on-april-7-8-in-mumbai/articleshow/81595698.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Stelis Biopharma to make over 200m doses of Sputnik V||HYDERABAD: After Hyderabad-based pharma companies Gland Pharma and Hetero Drugs, Russia’s sovereign wealth fund, Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), has now roped in Bengaluru-based Strides Group’s Stelis Biopharma Pvt Ltd to manufacture at least 200 million doses of Russian Covid-19 vaccine Sputnik V. As per the agreement, Stelis will begin supplying Sputnik V doses from the third quarter of 2021. The agreement was reached under the aegis of Enso Healthcare LLP, RDIF's coordination partner for sourcing Sputnik V vaccines in India. Apart from making a substantial contribution towards providing global supply of Sputnik V, Strides group will also work with RDIF to increase availability of the vaccine beyond the initial commitments, Strides Group founder Arun Kumar added. RDIF CEO Kirill Dmitriev said that the significant vaccine volumes produced jointly with Stelis will help widen access to the vaccine on a global scale. The pact with Stelis comes less than a week after RDIF inked a pact with Gland Pharma to manufacture up to 252 million doses. In November 2020, RDIF tied up a manufacturing deal with Hetero Drugs for 100 million doses. While Sputnik V, the world’s first registered vaccine against the novel coronavirus infection, has been approved for use in over 50 countries, it is awaiting EUA (emergency use authorisation) approval from the Indian drug regulator. RDIF’s partner in India, Hyderabad-based Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, had applied to the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) in February end but was asked to submit safety and immunogenicity data from the ongoing Phase II/III study on 1,600 volunteers in India. The two-dose vaccine uses two different human adenoviral vectors -- adenovirus 26 (Ad26) and adenovirus 5 (Ad5) – that are administered 21 days apart. Sputnik V demonstrated a 91.6% efficacy rate and offered a strong protective effect across all age groups, as per the efficacy data published in peer reviewed medical journal, The Lancet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/stelis-biopharma-to-make-over-200m-doses-of-sputnik-v/articleshow/81594741.cms||Swati Bharadwaj
---||Dehradun||HC directs state to file affidavit explaining how privacy of conversation between accused & lawyer is maintained in jails||NAINITAL: The Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Wednesday directed the state government to file a detailed counter affidavit presenting the set up in jails for maintaining the privacy of the conversation between an accused and his counsel. “The learned counsel for the state seeks two weeks’ time to file a detailed counter affidavit for bringing out clearly the set up prevailing in our jails for maintaining the privacy of conversation between the counsel and the prisoner,” read the order by the division bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma. The direction came as the court was hearing a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed in 2018 by Manisha Bhandari, a practising advocate in the Uttarakhand HC. Though the petition originally challenged the change in rules for meeting the inmates inside prisons, Bhandari has now moved an application in this PIL raising concerns about the privacy of the attorney-client discussions which, she claims, have been impacted due to the outbreak of coronavirus. Bhandari states, in the application, that after the Covid-19 pandemic hit the country, the rules to meet the prisoners in Uttarakhand’s jails have been changed. According to the new rules, the attorneys have to stand at least 12 feet away from their clients and talk through a window. “Is this rule a violation of the lawyer-client privilege? The inmate has the right to talk to his lawyer without being in an audible range of anybody else and vice versa,” read Bhandari’s application. Bhandari has further said that lawyer and client meetings are not courtesy calls but an opportunity to discuss the future course of action and therefore, its privacy needs to be protected. “The idea is always to discuss strategy, plan the future course of action for trial/bail or get information which happens to be privileged. An inmate is given this privilege under section 126 of the Evidence Act,” reads the application. The court has now asked the state government to file its counter affidavit till April 6. The case has been listed for further hearing on April 7.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/hc-directs-state-to-file-affidavit-explaining-how-privacy-of-conversation-between-accused-lawyer-is-maintained-in-jails/articleshow/81593588.cms||Prashant Jha

---||Mumbai||Consultee judges had opposed all 22 names proposed by HC||New Delhi: Bombay high court, during the very short tenure of Chief Justice B P Dharmadhikari, had recommended 22 names — 18 advocates and four judicial officers —for appointment as judges of the HC. However, the names had run into serious objection from two consultee judges, Justices A M Khanwilkar and D Y Chandrachud, whose parent HC is Bombay.Justices Khanwilkar and Chandrachud had in writing asked CJI Bobde to send all 22 names back to Bombay HC CJ Dipankar Datta for effective evaluation of merit and maintaining objectivity in the constitutional process of selection of HC judges. Sources said the two judges believed that Bombay high court, being in the financial capital of the country, required judges with domain knowledge in emerging fields of law and suggested that since Justice Datta had been chief justice for nearly 10 months, he should be asked to reconsider the names.However, Justice B R Gavai approved the names of “deserving” candidates from among the 22, but agreed with Justices Khanwilkar and Chandrachud for returning the remaining names for reconsideration. Justice Gavai did not fault Justice Dharmadhikari for recommending a large number of people for appointment as judges. He said Justice Dharmadhikari had been a judge of the HC since 2004 and had functioned on various benches to have reasonable knowledge about the talent pool in the HC.When CJI Bobde asked Justice Chandrachud to specify his objections against individuals, the latter wrote an even more stinging response and said when he was suggesting reconsideration of the entire list by Bombay HC, to give opinion on individuals would amount to “cherry picking”, sources said. After less than encouraging views from Justices Khanwilkar and Chandrachud, the CJI had sought the opinion of Justice U U Lalit on the 22 names.With just a little more than a month to go for his retirement, CJI Bobde believed the vacancies in Bombay HC needed to be filled urgently and scheduled the collegium meeting without waiting for Justice Lalit’s response. The meeting found 13 of the 22 names suitable for appointment as judges of Bombay HC. If these are approved by the government and they are appointed as judges, Bombay HC will still have 19 vacancies against a sanctioned strength of 94 judges.Justice Dharmadhikari was acting CJ of Bombay HC from February 20 to March 19 last year. He was chief justice from March 20 till his superannuation on April 27, 2020. Justices Khanwilkar and Chandrachud had said it was nearly impossible for a chief justice to prepare a list of 22 probable candidates for appointment as high court judges within a short span of two months. They said shortlisting a candidate for appointment as a judge required the high court CJ to watch the performance of the advocates, consult bar leaders and colleague judges about the integrity, ability and capability of each individual.They said most of the recommended people were around 55 years old and appointing people of this age group was not advisable as they would have a short tenure of around six years as HC judges retire at 62. According to them, most high court judges take at least two to three years to get acquainted with the art of writing judgments and adapting to the discipline intrinsic to the constitutional post.The two judges said it would be in the interest of the justice delivery system to return the 22 names for reconsideration. They said the selection of candidates needed to be broad-based keeping in mind the hopes and aspirations of deserving advocates practising not only in Bombay HC but before its benches in Aurangabad, Nagpur and Panaji.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/consultee-judges-had-opposed-all-22-names-proposed-by-hc/articleshow/81594791.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

While this has happened for the first time, the IIC secretariat said it has been done as per the existing election bylaws. Some the members of this prestigious institution said the IIC should have taken help of an expert from outside or could have even availed the service of some members who were earlier in the Election Commission rather than appointing the director of the institution, who is on the Centre’s rolls, as RO. In response to a set of emailed questions behind such a decision, the IIC secretary, Kanwal Wali said, “The Memorandum of Association and Rules and Regulations of the Centre and the Election Bylaws govern the conduct of elections of members to the Board of Trustees and Executive Committee. The Election Bylaws reads subject to overall supervision of the Election Committee, the director shall act as the returning officer and perform all such functions and do all such acts and things as may be necessary for effectually conducting all elections in the manner provided by or under the rules and bylaws of the Centre.” He said the RO for the biennial elections at the IIC has been appointed in accordance with the election bylaws.In his email response to whether this has been done for the first time, Wali said the IIC election bylaws were amended by its board of trustees in November 2019. The amended bylaws provide for returning officer for the IIC elections on the lines of general elections to Parliament and state legislature. On being asked whether the centre has received any complaint on this issue, Wali said one member had approached Delhi High Court questioning the appointment of director, IIC as the RO for the ensuing biennial elections. “After the Court expressed its displeasure over such frivolous litigation, the petitioner withdrew the writ petition,” he claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/appointment-of-employee-as-a-returning-officer-for-election-in-iic-raises-eyebrows/articleshow/81594815.cms||Dipak K Dash

---||Lucknow||Awadh mahotsav starts with vintage car rally, music, dance||Lucknow: Against the backdrop of sunset and minarets and domes resembling monuments of Lucknow, the grandeur and opulence of Awadh’s history came to fore when the annual Wajid Ali Shah Awadh Mahotsav kicked off at Sangeet Natak Akademi on Friday. Organised by UP Tourism, UP state cultural department and UPSNA, the colourful and vibrant evening celebrated Awadh’s music, craft and culture with performances by artists from the state and a peek into its rich history through display of a mini-picture gallery curated by the culture department. From pictures depicting the lifestyle of Nawabs of Awadh, a gala dinner thrown by Ghazi-ud-Din Haider, the first king of Awadh for a British resident, to portraits of Nawab Wajid Ali Shah and the procession of Muharram, visitors to the festival had a chance to revisit the rich history of 17th and 18th century Awadh. The festival began with a vintage car rally from La Martiniere College to Sangeet Natak Akademi’s premises where the crowd was seen posing and clicking pictures with the old classic beauties. Singer Anup Jalota mesmerised the crowd with his ever famous renditions ‘Aisi laagi lagan’ and ‘Rang de chunaria’, while presenting the rich legacy of Awadh’s Kathak gharana, kathak exponent Deepak Maharaj, the scion of legendary dancer Pandit Birju Maharaj and his troupe performed on traditional folk songs of the region and brought fore several stories through their deft expressions, hand movements and extensive footwork. “More such festivals promoting art, culture, heritage and history of Awadh will come up in the state in the future. While we need to preserve it, we also need to promote and keep it alive for the generations to come,” said tourism minister Neelkanth Tiwari. The three-day festival was hosted online and offline for the audience. Around 1.1k participants joined online through the virtual live-streaming on Facebook on Akademi’s official page. “The festival has combined all the elements of Awadh region -- the classical music and dance, the cuisine, the handicraft through local artisans, and the bonhomie of the individuals, apart from being a walk into its history, nawabs and the graceful culture. The second and third day of the festival will see more renowned artists on stage,” said UPSNA secretary Tarun Raj.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/awadh-mahotsav-starts-with-vintage-car-rally-music-dance/articleshow/81595785.cms||Aditi Singh
---||Delhi||Delhi: Two men beat snatcher to death, dump body in canal||NEW DELHI: Two men were arrested by Delhi Police from Unnao in Uttar Pradesh for allegedly thrashing to death a man in outer Delhi’s Bawana. They had then tied the hands and legs of the body and thrown it in Haiderpur canal. The victim was killed on March 9 after being caught for allegedly trying to snatch a phone of one of the accused. His body was found in the canal two days later. Police are looking for more suspects. The accused, Bablu (22) and Rajkumar (30), used to work as labourers in a factory in Bawana. On March 9, a resident of Bawana, Shahida Khatoon, lodged a missing complaint with police saying that her son, Mohammad Sazzad, had left their house on March 8, but had not returned since. An initial probe revealed that Sazzad had been caught in I-Block, Sector 4 of Bawana while he was allegedly snatching the phone. DCP (Outer-North) Rajiv Ranjan said Sazzad’s accomplices, identified as Shibua, Azaz and Multan, live in a JJ colony in Bawana. They told Khatoon that her son had been caught while snatching the phone. They then handed over the snatched phone to her, which she gave to police while lodging the complaint. Multan was earlier arrested in a snatching case. “When Sazzad’s accomplices were asked to join the probe, they went into hiding. A manhunt was then launched to locate Sazzad. On March 11, the decomposed body of a man with both hands and legs tied together was recovered from Haiderpur canal. After verification, the deceased was identified as Sazzad. A case of murder and destruction of evidence was then registered at Narela Industrial Area police station,” said Ranjan. During investigation, CCTV footage from the spot was checked and following local inquiry two of the suspects were identified. “With the help of technical surveillance, our team raided a premise in Unnao and arrested two men, Bablu and Rajkumar, on Wednesday for Sazzad’s murder,” said the DCP. The arrested men confessed to having killed Sazzad after he was caught snatching their phone, while his accomplices fled the spot. They added that they immediately left Delhi to evade arrest. Police said the duo was remanded to one-day police custody for interrogation. A search is on for the remaining accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/two-men-beat-snatcher-to-death-dump-body-in-canal/articleshow/81594837.cms||---
---||Delhi||IGDTUW students to mentor girls at Delhi govt schools||NEW DELHI: Students of Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women (IGDTUW) will now also mentor girl students of Delhi government schools. Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia launched the education mentoring programme on Saturday. The programme will be a part of the Delhi government’s “Youth for Education” initiative, which will focus on mentoring of girls studying in classes IX to XII. Initially, 200 BTech, MTech, PhD and MBA students of IGDTUW will mentor 1,000 government school students. Each mentor will have five students. The mentors will clear their doubts related to careers in STEM, share strategies for cracking entrance exams, support in accessing learning resources and motivate them at different stages of life. At the launch event, Sisodia said: “Though our nation is seeing some major innovations in every field of work, these innovations are mostly led by men. The participation of women is abysmal when it comes to innovation, especially in the field of STEM. According to a study, women form only 33% of the total workforce in research and innovation in STEM in South Asia.” The deputy CM added that “the Delhi government wants to empower students in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.” “We want our students, especially girls, to receive the right guidance, which will help them build sustainable innovations. It is our vision that our girls equally dominate the STEM sector.” Addressing the mentors, Sisodia said that “approximately 21 lakh children are enrolled every year in pre-primary and primary schools. However, only 10,000 girls take up STEM courses in higher education. We need to fill this gap and hence, your mentoring will play a crucial role.” Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal wants to bring about a revolution in the education sector, said Sisodia. “We fixed the infrastructure. We laid the foundation of basic education to help our students take pride in attending government schools. We built the professional capacity of our teachers and sent them all over the world— Harvard, Cambridge, Singapore and Finland—for training. The results of our efforts are for you to see. Delhi government school children attained 98% pass percentage in CBSE board exams. Our students are going to IITs without any coaching,” he added. “Many students are confused about their long-term goals, and they require the right information at the right time because making such decisions can be challenging. The best kind of guidance a student can receive is from his/her seniors and I’m happy that you will play a key role in that,” the deputy CM told the mentors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/varsity-students-to-mentor-girls-at-delhi-govt-schools/articleshow/81609293.cms||---
---||Mumbai||BEST reels under pandemic blow, incurs Rs 1,859 crore deficit||MUMBAI: The Covid-19 pandemic dealt a huge blow to BEST undertaking with ticket sales plummeting to the lowest levels during the initial months, resulting in a deficit of Rs 1,859 crore between April 2020 and February 2021, the latest statistics released on Friday revealed. “The total income during this period was Rs 398 crore, while the expenditure on running buses, fuel and other overheads was Rs 2,257 crore,” said a senior BEST official, adding revenue earnings were the lowest between April and September as compared to recent years and picked up pace from October onwards. A year ago (February 2020), ridership was around 35 lakh, but dropped drastically to one lakh in April. Buses were pressed into service across Mumbai metropolitan region, but only essential workers were being ferried. In June, when lockdown restrictions were lifted, BEST expected ridership figures to improve, but they climbed to only 2.5 lakh by June 15. The numbers gradually grew to 16 lakh in September, 23 lakh in November and now nearly 25 lakh citizens travel by buses, the official said. However, the damage was done and the deficit bloated excessively, another official said. “Usually, operational losses are in the range of Rs 800 crore to a maximum of Rs 1,600 crore, but the Covid crisis escalated it,” he said. BEST panel members have therefore opposed any more loans from BMC, the first one being a Rs 406-crore loan offered by the civic body which was recently rejected with a demand that it should be converted to ‘financial aid’. Senior committee member Sunil Ganacharya said BEST was already burdened with outstandings of Rs 2,483 crore. “We have a long term loan of Rs 350 crore, short term loans of around Rs 475 crore, overdraft of Rs 210 crore, besides Rs 167 crore outstanding payments to Tata Power (for purchase of electricity for the island city) among other outstandings,” he informed the panel at Thursday’s meeting. He further said BEST pays over Rs 100 crore taxes, hence taking a loan would not be advisable. “We have suffered a lot with our workers too being affected (over 2,800 staffers were Covid positive). Yet we continue to provide the cheapest mode of transport at Rs 5 for a 5-km ride anywhere in the city,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/best-reels-under-pandemic-blow-incurs-rs-1859cr-deficit-in-mumbai/articleshow/81595868.cms||Somit Sen

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: SC nod to elevate 3 women advocates as HC judges||MUMBAI: Bombay high court took 134 years since its establishment in 1862 to get its first three women judges and, on Friday, the Supreme Court Collegium led by Chief Justice of India S A Bobde recommended three women lawyers, at one go, for their elevation as Bombay HC judges. The three women lawyers are additional public prosecutor Aruna Pai, Sharmila Deshmukh, the standing counsel for MCZMA who also appears regularly for Maharashtra Pollution Control Board, and Amira Abdul Razaq, who practices in Goa.  “Three women judges to be appointed at the same time, when it happens, would certainly be a first for Bombay high court,’’ former Bombay Bar Association president Milind Sathe said. Justice Sujata Manohar, now 86, appointed on January 23, 1978, was the first woman judge of Bombay HC. The second, Justice Katy Baam, was sworn in after a hiatus of 16 years, in October 1994. The third appointment was Justice Pratibha Upasani in March 1996. Justice Ranjana Desai was a close fourth in April 1996. Currently, Bombay HC has eight women judges; the last to be appointed was Justice M S Jawalkar in December 2019. Prior to that, Justice P V Ganediwala was appointed in February 2019, while Justices Bharati Dangre and Vibha Kankanwadi were appointed together on June 5, 2017. Justice Swapna Joshi appointed in 2016 is due to retire in August. The remaining three are Justices Sadhana Jadhav since 2012, Revati Mohite Dere since 2013 and Anuja Prabhudessai since 2014.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaisc-nod-to-elevate-3-women-advocates-as-hc-judges/articleshow/81594832.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Agra||Farmers’ protest not of any particular community, says Jayant Chaudhary||AGRA: Taking on BJP leaders who have been dubbing the kisan protests a “Jat movement”, Rashtriya Lok Dal vice-president Jayant Chaudhary said the agitation was from all communities. Chaudhary, who was addressing a kisan mahapanchayat in Mathura along with Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav, said it is incorrect to link the ongoing protests with any community. “Farmers across the country are against the new farm laws and all communities were involved in demanding their rollback,” he said. Akhilesh Yadav said that the next government can “only be ours if we stay united and follow the way of bhaichara (brotherhood)”. “BJP is the party which conspires and they are ruling by creating fissure among us,” he said. “BJP is scared of the farmers’ unity as all of you are standing together and this movement will continue till all the three farm laws are withdrawn by the government,” said the former chief minister, criticising the government for insulting the farmers by calling them “terrorists”. Yadav slammed the BJP government for the “ruthless” imposition of the Covid-19 lockdown last year by putting restrictions. He said, “The government advised people to cover their noses and mouths to save themselves during the pandemic. But what disease are these powerful leaders suffering that they have closed their eyes and ears and are not understanding the pain of the farmers?” This was the first occasion when both the leaders shared the stage after their 2019 alliance for the Lok Sabha elections. Even though the poll results did not go in the favour of either of the parties, they have continued their relations and are likely to enter into an alliance in the assembly elections due next year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/farmers-protest-not-of-any-particular-community-says-jayant-chaudhary/articleshow/81592937.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Videos of argument between provost, girl students go viral||Lucknow: A day after controversy broke out over a ‘dress code notice’ at Lucknow University’s Tilak Girls Hostel, two video clips of argument between hostel inmates and provost on the issue went viral on social media on Friday. Though LU denied issuing any notice prohibiting girl students from wearing short dresses on the hostel premises, the clips show the provost purportedly justifying the dress code as girls argue against it. The two clips were shot on Tuesday by a few girls while some of their hostel mates were debating the issue with provost Prof Bhuneshwari Bharadwaj. A hand written notice was found pasted on the wall outside the mess on Thursday morning but vanished within hours when some students’ organisations objected to it. In the first video of 2 minutes and 14 seconds, the provost is heard telling girls that as per the rulebook, they have to wear decent clothes and shorts above thigh-length are considered as innerwear. Girls respond by arguing that what’s wrong in wearing something in which they are comfortable and that too among the girls within the hostel premises. The provost is heard as saying, “If you think this (short dresses) is decent, go and attend classes in the same clothes.” A girl responds by saying that it all depends on comfort level, to which the provost counters that it was not allowed in hostels as male staff also worked there. In the second video (2 minutes and 34 seconds), the provost is heard asking students to take refund of their hostel fee and leave. She also asks them to meet the chief provost and dean of student welfare, and if these two officers lift the ban, she would have no problem. She also tells students that rules were framed by the university long ago and it was her duty to implement them. While the provost refused to comment on the issue, LU spokesperson Prof Durgesh Srivastava said, “The clips only show an interaction between the student and provost. It is not a formal meeting where girls are being told to follow a dress code. This happened when girls went to meet the provost.” He denied that the university has officially issued any notice. Girls, however, said the hand writing on the notice and the pattern was similar to other notices pasted earlier.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/videos-of-argument-between-provost-girl-students-go-viral/articleshow/81595831.cms||Mohita Tewari
---||Goa||Churchill face TRAU in winner-takes-all clash||The message at the start of the season for Churchill Brothers FC and Tiddim Road Athletic Union (TRAU) FC was loud and clear. For Churchill, as always, “it’s the title or nothing.” For TRAU, “save relegation” was all that mattered. While Churchill are still in control of their own destiny and can even win the I-League title on Sunday – if Gokulam Kerala FC drop points later in the day – their dream could be crushed by TRAU, a team who were more than happy to just stave off relegation. Now, having reached so far, TRAU have dreams of their own. Should they edge past Churchill at the Kishore Bharati Krirangan, the title could be theirs. “Never,” said TRAU coach Nandakumar Singh when asked if the title was ever on their mind during this season. “We always dreamed of surviving relegation and entering the top six. I knew it would be tough (to stay in the league), that’s why I am saying TRAU never dreamed of the title. Fortunately, God is with us. Our team has come up.” Not just God, some players have blessed them with spectacular performances too. Bidyashagar Singh, for example, has scored 11 goals, including two consecutive hat-tricks, a rarity for an Indian striker. Then there is Komron Tursunov, who has scored some important goals including the winner from a late free-kick against Punjab FC. Tursunov is now back home, doing duty for the Tajikistan national team, and his absence could prove crucial. Churchill coach Fernando Varela would brush aside that absence; his team, after all, has missed the likes of Clayvin Zuniga, Hamza Kheir, Richard Costa and Joseph Clemente for more than just a handful of games with injuries. Despite the absentees, the former champions seemed to be galloping towards the title with a 11-match unbeaten run. Then they lost against Gokulam Kerala FC (0-3), and Mohammedan Sporting (1-4) made it worse. Two consecutive losses and the team is feeling the heat. “Now this is like a final for us,” said defender Kamran Farooque. “We will do our best to win. We have to utilise whatever we learned during this season. We have to do the hard work on the pitch.” Except for the last two games, Varela seemed to have got the best out of the team, using his players judiciously. Even the losses against Kerala and Mohammedan, the coach said, was not a true reflection of what transpired on the field. TRAU will provide him with his biggest test this season and there will not be a second chance. “We have to be focused and correct our mistakes. We’ve the same chance to win the I-League as before. Nothing changes for us. We have to stay on course and stay determined. “Our team has already shown the level of football we can play in all the matches. We need to believe in our ability with the ball. We have to trust ourselves. The boys will fight till the final second,” said Varela. Let the fight begin.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/churchill-face-trau-in-winner-takes-all-clash/articleshow/81609322.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

After a ‘chakka jam’ for about half-an-hour, Shetti, prominent activists and representatives of various other outfits were detained to quell the protest that was getting bigger. Shetti had given a call for the agitation to block the main highways. The Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana workers participated at several places such as the Satara-Koregaon highway, the Satara-Pandharpur highway and many places in the Sangli district. In Kolhapur, Shetti, along with power expert Pratap Hogade, led the protest. The vehicles were stuck and there were snarl stretching for kilometres. Before he was detained, Shetti said, “Our demands are simple. Waive the power bills of consumers with consumption of less than 300 units for the lockdown period. Second, correct the inflated bills for the remaining period and provide the consumers’ a facility to pay the amount in installments. Our demands are not new. We have been making these demands since the start of the pandemic.” Shetti said most consumers did not pay the bills in the past year and the Mahavitaran is responsible. “During the six months of the pandemic, the Mahavitaran staff issued bills without taking actual readings — based on earlier consumption data. Also, they did not come to recover the dues for six months. As a result most consumers have not paid the bills. We want the fine imposed on payment delays waived,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/shetti-warns-power-utility-against-disconnections/articleshow/81592462.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Stop physical classes, resume online instruction: Activists||HYDERABAD: With the surge in Covid-19 cases in the state, parents and child-rights activists are demanding that schools resume online classes and stop physical classes immediately. Teachers and parents said that about 90% of schools have stopped online classes after physical classes resumed on February 1 and added that the state should take measures to ensure that all students get to continue their education in virtual mode. “The government has reopened schools, but failed to maintain the Covid-19 protocols and required safety and security measures in government institutions. They should immediately shut down physical classes for all students, except class 10,” said N Narayana, president, Telangana Parents Association (TPA), adding that parents are under stress and anxiety ever since physical classes started. The child-rights activists demanded that classes should be suspended for upper primary students. “Measures should be taken to ensure that these students are attending classes telecast via TSAT, Doordarshan, and other modes,” said E Raghunandan, general secretary, BalalaHakula Sankshema Sangham. He said that in the current situation, it is not wise to continue conducting physical classes for all students and put the lives of students and teachers at risk. The members of the Telangana Recognized Schools Managements Association, meanwhile, submitted a representation to the education minister asking the state not to shut down schools. They requested the minister to release the examination schedule as children are passed without examination even in the last academic year. “Rather than imposing a large-scale lockdown in the view of sporadic cases, it is better to close down schools where cases are being reported for 15 days. Closing down all school will do more harm than good as it is going to create severe learning loss,” said Shekar Rao Y, president, TRSMA, adding although few cases have been reported here and there, the majority of schools have been effectively conducting physical classes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/stop-physical-classes-resume-online-instruction-activists/articleshow/81594844.cms||---

Defence minister Rajnath Singh is scheduled to inaugurate the second day of the meeting at Mazra Dabas on Sunday. The party is likely to discuss what led to its poor performance in the recent bypolls and to plan the course of action for the municipal polls, which are to be held next year. Delhi BJP’s in-charge Baijayant Jai Panda, in his virtual address, praised the party workers for not only their political and organisational work but also for doing constructive social work during the Covid-19 pandemic. Panda welcomed GNCTD Act (Amendment) Bill 2021 and asked the workers to discuss it with common people and tell them how it would give them an effective administrative system. Panda also asked BJP workers to create awareness about increasing pollution and water supply shortage in the national capital. Delhi unit chief Adesh Gupta claimed that party workers now seemed more enthusiastic and energised, while the party was ready for 2022 civic polls at the booth level. At the meeting, Leader of Opposition Ramvir Singh Bidhuri introduced the political resolution for discussion and asked the party workers to expose the “failures of the Kejriwal government.” Alka Gurjar, Delhi BJP co-incharge, stressed on continued organisational tours by party functionaries for direct communication with the public.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/after-bypolls-bjp-meet-to-discuss-plan-for-civic-polls/articleshow/81609317.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: Three govt school teachers, 4 students test positive||BHOPAL: Poor preparations to fight the pandemic surfaced in schools on Friday after 3 teachers of government schools and 4 students of CBSE schools tested positive for Covid-19. School education department has confirmed that 3 government school teachers have tested positive. However, when asked about the students, the department refused to divulge information. After opening of schools since December 18, it was expected that the schools would strictly follow the Covid instructions. Government schools found short of such preparations. DEO Bhopal Nitin Saxena confirmed to TOI that 3 school teachers have tested positive. “A teacher in Navin girls school and two in Nutan College have tested positive,” said Saxena. About students testing positive in a private school, Saxena said, “I have also only heard about it. However, there is no official information available with me.” Meanwhile, the Madhya Pradesh Professional Examination Board (MPPEB) has postponed the written examination which was scheduled to start from April 6 for the recruitment of 4,000 posts of police constable. In this regard, PEB has uploaded the postponement information on the website. It has been written on the website that this decision has been taken due to the fast spreading of corona infection in the state. About 10 lakh candidates have applied for this recruitment. The exam is deferred at a time when the candidates were waiting for the admit card. The MPPEB has issued a notice on the website saying that information about the new date of the examination will be given soon. Even students of Nutan College also staged a demonstration demanding for online examination. Students said that the corona is rising again. In such a situation, if they are infected, then who will be responsible? College officials said that they are following the instructions as per the government orders. Students said that they studied online since Covid surfaced. “Now again corona infection is increasing. In such a situation, colleges are preparing to take our offline exam from April which is not acceptable,” said a student without quoting her name. College’s principal, Dr Pratibha Singh, said that the demands of the girl students have been conveyed verbally to the authorities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/3-govt-school-teachers-4-students-test-positive/articleshow/81593662.cms||---

Its gains in the assembly election would also pitch it in the race to take control of the AIADMK. The AMMK is working hard to dent the prospects of the AIADMK in the southern and delta districts. The caste factor will take centre stage in this battle. V K Sasikala stepping aside from politics has forced the AMMK to go full throttle against the “betrayers” (the AIADMK leadership) and the “evil force” (DMK). The party had cut into the AIADMK’s vote share in the 2019 general elections by recording a 5.24% share and securing third place in 22 LS seats. In Chidambaram, DMK ally Thol Thirumavalavan had managed to scrape through with a margin of 3,219 votes in a nail-biting contest against the AIADMK. AMMK’s A Elavarasan polled 62,308 votes. In the 2019 byelections, Dhinakaran secured 7.5% of the votes. He was a vote spoiler for the AIADMK in mukkulathor dominant seats, Andipatti and Periakulam. Former MLA I Mahendran polled 31,199 votes in Thiruparankundram, when the DMK won by a margin of 2,396 votes. The AMMK swept the local body polls in Kayathar panchayat union poll in Kovilpatti constituency. Dhinakaran who hails from the mukkulathor community has its strong backing. The anger over the treatment meted out to Sasikala by the Edappadi K Palaniswami dispensation is a driving force for the AMMK cadres. “We will gain 50% of the AIADMK votes. OPS and others betrayed Chinnamma (Sasikala),” AMMK’s headquarters secretary and Tiruppattur candidate K K Umadhevan said. The AMMK has fielded thevar candidates in most of its constituencies in the south. Three of the four nominees in Sivaganga constituencies belong to kallar group, a thevar sub sect. So are the six nominees for Madurai and three in Dindigul. The party has also got four of its allies, caste outfits, to contest on the AMMK’s cooker symbol. With deputy CM O Panneerselvam facing protests in his southern backyard over the EPS government’s decision to concede 10.5% internal quota for vanniyars, the AMMK hopes to champion the cause of the other communities. In Sriperumbudur, Dhinakaran said, “A government that applies butter in one eye and lime in the other should not be allowed to return.” The AMMK cadres recall Dhinakaran’s visit to the memorials of leaders like Immanuel Sekaran, Veeran Alagumuthu Kone, Puli Thevan and Muthuramalinga Thevar to pay respects and earn the goodwill of the communities. The AMMK’s first list of candidates had vanniyar, gounder, naidu, SC other than mukkulathor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/super-spoiler-down-south/articleshow/81594846.cms||Julie Mariappan

The insurance regulator has made it mandatory for insurers to offer a sum insured between Rs 50,000 to Rs 10 lakh under the Arogya Sanjeevani policy as against the previous range of Rs 1 lakh - Rs 5 lakh. Arogya Sanjeevani is the standardised health insurance product that was launched in March 2020. “In order to enhance the coverage available under Arogya Sanjeevani Policy, in partial modification of the extant guidelines, insurers shall mandatorily offer the sum insured between Rs 50,000 to Rs 10 lakh under the standard product from May 1, 2021, or earlier,” IRDAI said in a circular. In fact, in July last year, the insurance watchdog had allowed health and general insurance companies to offer Arogya Sanjeevani Policy for a cover higher than Rs 5 lakh based on their underwriting policies, but many insurers did not launch such covers. Commenting on the latest move, Sanjay Datta, chief-underwriting, claims and reinsurance, ICICI Lombard General Insurance, said, “Allowing higher sun insured options will render the product a viable option for metros and tier-1 cities and for customers with increasing family size looking for an enhanced coverage.” Prasun Sikdar, MD & CEO, ManipalCigna Health Insurance Company Ltd, pointed out that the impact of Covid-19 is making people realise that health insurance is no more a priority but a necessity. “Till recently, a health insurance floater policy of Rs 5 lakh was considered adequate. However, in the current situation, people are proactively looking to increase their coverage…The benefit of high coverage under Arogya Sanjeevani Policy will ensure that quality healthcare remains accessible and affordable to millions of people in India,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/irdai-hikes-maximum-cover-under-arogya-sanjeevani-policy-to-rs-10-lakh/articleshow/81607833.cms||Swati Rathor
---||Lucknow||School dropout performs C-section in UP, woman, child die||LUCKNOW: A 30-year-old school dropout who doubled up as a surgeon at a private nursing home in Sultanpur district, wielded a shaving razor blade to perform a caesarean section on a woman, who bled to death hours after the surgery late Wednesday. The baby died minutes after birth. The accused, Rajendra Shukla, who studied till Class 8, was roped in by the owner of Maa Sharda nursing home, Rajesh Sahni, a year ago to perform surgeries at his ill-equipped clinic in Saini village. Both Shukla and Sahni were arrested and booked for culpable homicide, not amounting to murder on Thursday after a police complaint by the deceased woman’s husband. Sahni, who had barely passed Class 12, ran his unregistered nursing home in the village with quacks and midwives. Superintendent of police, Sultanpur, Arvind Chaturvedi, who investigated the case, told TOI that the shocker unfolded after a villager, Rajaram, reached Baldirai police station and lodged a complaint that his wife, Poonam, 33, and their newborn died due to medical negligence at Maa Sharda Hospital. “A police team was swiftly dispatched to the private hospital and we found it was an unregistered clinic with no infrastructure to perform surgeries.  Quacks used blades to do simple operations,” he said. “When Poonam went into labour on Wednesday night, she was taken to a midwife, Radha Dubey, who told her husband, Rajaram, to shift her to a primary health centre in Deeh area. Here, an auxiliary nurse, Rubi, examined her and told Rajaram to move her to Maa Sharda hospital as her condition was critical,” said SHO Baldiram, Amrendra Singh. An ambulance driver, Arun Mishra, who took her to hospital and husband of a midwife were detained for questioning. When Poonam bled profusely at the makeshift operation table, accused Rajendra Shukla told Rajaram to take her to district hospital. With no hospital in vicinity ready to treat her, she was driven 140km to KGMU Trauma Centre, Lucknow, where she died. Police have written to chief medical officer to act against illegal clinics.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/school-dropout-performs-c-sec-woman-child-die/articleshow/81595873.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Bail for riot accused on ground of parity||NEW DELHI: A man facing charges of rioting during the violence in northeast Delhi in February 2020 was granted bail by a court. The accused was granted bail after the court observed other accused in the case were already out on bail. Additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav said, “I find that the applicant also deserves bail in the matter on grounds of parity with several other co-accused people, who have already been enlarged on bail by this court vide various orders.” The accused Imran’s counsel Rahul Jail sought bail for his client, submitting that the former had been framed in the matter by the investigating agency only because he belonged to a particular community and resided in the same locality where the alleged incident took place. Jain also argued that prior to his arrest, Imran was under medical treatment at Institute of Human Behaviour and Allied Sciences, and he has been languishing in jail since February 19, 2021. The counsel submitted that the trial was going to take a long time and a chargesheet had been filed by the investigating agency, meaning Imran’s custodial interrogation was no longer required. Special public prosecutor Amit Prasad opposed the plea, arguing that a policeman had identified the accused who was also spotted in a video clip participating in a meeting that was the “road map for violence”. However, the court noted that Imran hadn’t been named or identified by the complainant in the case. His role was also stated to be identical to those accused persons who were earlier granted bail. The complaint had alleged that a truck had been vandalised and a sugarcane godown had been set on fire by a mob on February 24, 2020. The court directed the accused to not tamper with evidence or influence any witnesses in any manner and to maintain peace and harmony in the area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bail-for-riot-accused-on-ground-of-parity/articleshow/81594913.cms||---

It should be developed in the interest of the locals and tourists. The government will extend all cooperation to boost employment through tourism development here,” he said. Padvi suggested government help in the orchard planting program in the district, which will help the hills get a green cover. The minister also mentioned that the gram panchayat could be involved in this. During the visit to the agriculture department, he said that the government would provide every help required in orchard plantation. He also said, “An effort should be made in using seeds coated with soil and nutrition, which can be sprayed across the hills. This will help in the plantation at a rapid pace. This is not a substitute for the plantation programme at all.” The chief minister has also asked the authorities to prepare a proposal for a Rs 16 crore power substation at Survani in Dhadgaon taluka that will meet the demand for the power consumers in Akrani, Akkalkuva region. Addressing the media, Thackeray said the state government was keen on producing the Covid-19 vaccine and has had a discussion with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the same. “The Prime Minister has asked us to send a proposal.

He came to know from his neighbour in the nick of the time that his home state will not allow buses from Maharashtra to enter from Sunday onwards. He rushed with his family. Dasharat was among the many other migrant workers from different districts of neighbouring MP who go back to their villages at this time of the year. The travel ban by the MP government with an objective to prevent the spread of Covid comes at a time when migrants rush back for Holi and harvest.  Not only those in Nagpur but workers from MP employed in states as far as Gujarat and down south try to reach home at this time. Apart from Holi, it’s also harvest time for wheat and chana (gram) grown in their fields. The workers set out after the sowing season during winters and return for harvest at this time. Their journey back had just begun and the ban has been imposed. The move is expected to leave a number of them stranded, say bus operators on this route. Some were also seen leaving as the lockdown had left them jobless. Bodhan Singh had brought his daughter to the city for treatment. She had swallowed a five rupee coin after which the family rushed to Nagpur. “Luckily it came out with the stools so we are returning without taking her to the doctor. Singh, who was here for three days, knew of the travel ban and so was rushing home. “Many may not be even knowing at all. They may not be able to go back now. Only a small fraction of the workers has gone so far. The journey continues till March end. Still the workers in Gujarat and southern states haven’t reached. Even they take the bus to their villages from Nagpur,” said a bus operator. Mahesh Karmeti, also waiting at the bus stop with his family, said they had to leave urgently. “It’s raining and if we don’t reach the village in time the wheat crop would be damaged,” He was a little aware of the ban. Another family waiting closeby only came to know about the travel ban after they reached the bus stand on Friday afternoon. Vinaykumar wanting to reach Rewa was not aware about any travel ban at all.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mps-ban-on-buses-hits-returning-workforce-hard/articleshow/81594869.cms||Shishir Arya

In a statement, the party said Kejriwal has always stood with the farmers, who have been fighting for their rights at the Delhi’s borders for months. “AAP has ensured facilities, like drinking water, toilets and Wi-Fi to the farmers,” it said, while blaming Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh and Badals of SAD for helping in “bringing the three laws.” “A sustained agitation has been going on across the country. Farmers have been sitting at Tikri, Singhu and Ghazipur borders for months. They have spent nights in bitter cold of Delhi, while hundreds of innocent farmers have sacrificed their lives,” the statement said. Kejriwal is scheduled to address the kisan mahapanchayat on April 4 at Huda Maidan in Jind, Haryana.

And like on the day of his discharge from state-run SSG Hospital in March last year, NRI Chirag Pandit continues to admire the treatment that he had received from the doctors of the government hospital. For Pandit, who works with a Spain-based co-operative, life has changed for the better in the year that has passed. He has started walking 7 km a day. “Covid-19 has taught me to take care of myself and my body. One needs to spend at least an hour on his or her body daily to remain fit and healthy,” said Pandit, 50. He further said that whether he is in Vadodara or in Spain, he does not miss walking 7-8 km a day. Recollecting the dreadful days when he was under treatment at the isolation ward of SSG Hospital after he tested positive of Covid-19, Pandit said that he saw death up close. “I was very nervous. In fact, my nervousness increased when another patient with travel history of Sri Lanka, died during treatment. He was undergoing treatment on the bed adjacent to me. But by God’s grace I survived,” he said. “I got the confidence to fight the battle against Covid-19 because of the team of doctors who remained on their toes. I was the first patient in Vadodara so treating me was a challenge for them as well. But without panicking they stood strong and treated me,” said Pandit. He also added that Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani too lifted his spirits by assuring that the state government would provide the best available treatment. “Since then, much has changed. There are even 100-year-olds who have fully recovered. The fear of coronavirus has reduced because of vaccines and medicines,” said Pandit, who is yet to take his first dose of Covid vaccine. The businessman said he remained weak for nearly six months post discharge from the hospital. “I will undergo vaccination based on my family doctor’s advice,” said Pandit, who has so far undertaken nearly 25 Covid tests. “It is frustrating as every time I have to fly, I need a RT-PCR Covid negative report but that’s the new normal,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/brush-with-death-and-covid-19-bettered-my-life/articleshow/81594521.cms||Prashant Rupera

---||Lucknow||Lucknow: ED registers PMLA case against private company||LUCKNOW: The Enforcement Directorate, Lucknow Zone has registered a PMLA case against Anee Bullion Industries Private Limited and its 18 other associated companies on Friday. Its director Ajeet Kumar Gupta and 18 others have also been booked by the agency. The ED took up the case on the basis of 30 FIRs registered against the firm for duping people of around Rs 1,000 crore. The FIRs have been registered in different police stations of the state including Lucknow, Sultanpur, Amethi, Pratapgarh, Rae Bareli, Ayodhya and Barabanki. Gupta was arrested by joint teams of STF and Lucknow police on July 16, 2020. ED sources said that Gupta’s wife is an IFS officer who has also been named in several FIRs registered by the investors in Lucknow and Sultanpur and is under the ED scanner. The ED said that prima facie it came to the fore that funds were diverted and misappropriated by Anee Bullion Industries Private limited and its 18 other associated companies through its members and other persons. Explaining the modus operandi, the ED said that the company first floated many ponzi schemes in various places of Uttar Pradesh through various companies Anee Bullion Traders, Anee Commodity Brokers Private limited, Eye Vision India Credit Co-operative Society Limited, Anee Bullion Industries, along with several others. The company also lured the investors to invest in the company assuring a good return on their investments in the form of plots. The company even went on to issue post-dated cheques to convince the investors. However, the investors got apprehensive when the cheques bounced, said an ED official. The company also duped investors by showing forged documents of land/plots being registered in the name of the company, the ED said. ED officials privy to the probe said that neither the company returned the invested amount nor gave any plots as promised to the investors. It also came to the fore during investigation, that the directors of the companies have diverted the investors’ money to other related companies and used it for creation of movable/immovable assets in the name of their close relatives. A senior official privy to the ED probe said that efforts are on to identify the movable and immovable properties of the society and related persons as they are liable to be attached under Prevention of Money laundering Act, 2002. The role of other members of society and related private persons will also be investigated by the premier financial investigating agency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ed-registers-pmla-case-against-private-company/articleshow/81595904.cms||---
---||Mumbai||BMC plans random testing using antigen kits at malls, stations, bus stops||MUMBAI: Starting next week, the BMC plans to carry out random Covid tests at crowded places, including malls, railway stations and bus stops, in a bid to detect more cases and boost micro-containment. "In case of those testing positive they would be institutionally quarantined in BMC Covid care centres if required. The aggressive testing drive would also ensure an increase in daily tests in the city from 25,000 to 50,000," said an official. The move comes days after the Centre urged the state to increase testing at public places using rapid antigen kits due to the rising cases of Covid in Maharashtra. Every civic ward will be given a target for antigen tests. "It is not possible to test everyone who enters places like malls as there are lakhs of people visiting them daily and therefore civic staff will conduct antigen tests randomly. However, those carrying an RT-PCR negative test not older than 72 hours will not have to undergo the antigen tests," said an official adding that the modalities as to who will pay for these tests are yet to be worked out. An additional reason for this directive was that medical health officers across wards had pointed out that a large number of cases that were detected recently were of those who had stepped out to join gatherings like weddings or to dine out or undertake other leisure activities. BMC commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal confirmed that random tests will be conducted. The BMC commissioner on Friday has also given instructions for all government and private hospitals to increase the number of beds available to maximise their capacity for Covid patients within the next 48 hours. Currently, BMC is already conducting antigen tests at civic ward offices to ensure that their own staff is protected. Besides, hawkers are also being tested at random, as in a recent drive that was conducted over two days at Bhaji Galli in Grant Road and Sadashiv Lane in Girgaum.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaibmc-plans-random-testing-using-antigen-kits-at-malls-stns-bus-stops/articleshow/81594915.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Chandigarh||Drama, sparring and unity, Haryana budget session saw it all||CHANDIGARH: The two-week-long budget session of Haryana state assembly that ended on Thursday was full of drama, suspense, triumph, attacks and counter-attacks on several issues bothering the state’s politics. While the main opposition party Congress, led by Bhupinder Singh Hooda, aggressively attacked the treasury bench, the ruling alliance was equally prepared to counter. The farmers’ agitation was seen dominating most of the discussions and even led to bringing a no confidence motion in the assembly. The session witnessed dramatic scenes, when chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar got emotional while attacking leader of opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda for sitting on a tractor pulled by woman legislators on Women’s Day. It also put on a spot the Jananayak Janata Party (JJP) legislators who were vocal on farmers’ issues outside the House but followed the party official line during the no confidence motion. JJP MLA Devender Babli spoke outside the assembly, advising his party to withdraw support from the BJP government on farmers’ issues to avoid public wrath. It was the first such direct statement from any JJP MLA. The House witnessed uproar and stiff opposition from the Congress over the move of condemning those opposing entry of MLAs/political leaders in villages over farmers’ agitation, and also over the Bill regarding recovery of damages to property by rioters. On both occasions the Congress walked out the assembly. Independent MLAs, Balraj Kundu from Meham and Sombir Sangwan from Charkhi-Dadri, were quite vocal on farmers’ issues inside the House and condemned the coalition government. Both received strong support from the Congress legislators in the assembly. The Manohar Lal Khattar-led saffron outfit, however, also emerged stronger as it won the number game defeating the no confidence motion with 55:32 ratio in the 88-member House. It showed that Khattar could retain power even without 10 JJP MLAs. The motion was defeated after a stormy discussion of around six hours. The House appeared united over the “high handed” bureaucracy in the state criticising the behaviour of several bureaucrats not paying heed to public representatives. Even the speaker was also seen supporting the MLAs across the parties on the issue asking them to give him the name of such bureaucrats promising tough action against them. Several MLAs, including former speaker Congress’s Raghubir Kadian, praised speaker Gian Chand Gupta for the manner he handled the House during the session. The session also missed the voice of Indian National Lok Dal (INLD), which was once the state’s largest party, as only INLD MLA Abhay Singh had resigned from the assembly some time back. The House also witnessed solidarity and light moments on certain issues. The gesture of the speaker to handover the proceedings to five women legislators on Women’s Day was welcomed by all. Expressing solidarity with the leader of opposition, the CM also accepted his demand for reconsideration of the sports university bill and sent it to the select committee. It is for the first time in the past around two decades that any bill has been forwarded to a select committee. In 14-days, the proceedings of the House were held for nine days, in which 11 sittings took place and 16 bills were tabled. The proceedings of the House were conducted for 45 hours and 42 minute. While 362 starred questions, 204 unstarred questions were accepted and four call to attention motion were included in the proceedings. Out of the 16 bills tabled in the House, 14 were passed. Khattar, who also holds the portfolio of finance minister, presented his second state budget. A total of nine hours 48 minutes were spent discussing governor’s address and 10 hours, 13 minutes were spent by members on discussion on budget.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/drama-sparring-and-unity-hry-budget-session-saw-it-all/articleshow/81594907.cms||Ajay Sura
---||Chandigarh||HC notice to HPSC, chief secy on plea against HCS exam quota policy||Chandigarh: The Punjab and Haryana high court has issued notice to the Haryana Public Service Commission (HPSC) and the Haryana chief secretary on a plea questioning the reservation policy under BC-A category adopted in the recently advertised Haryana Civil Services (executive branch) and allied services examination. Both the commission and the state government have been asked to submit responses on the issue by May 5. Justice G S Sandhawalia issued the notice after hearing a petition filed by Monu, 35, a resident of Buroli village in Haryana’s Rewari district. The petitioner is an ex-servicemen category candidate belonging to Backward Class (BC-A) category and an applicant against posts as per the advertisement issued on February 26. It has been alleged that the petitioner’s right for consideration against the other posts in the said category for BC-A has been denied by providing reservation against only one post for the assistant employment officer and the benefit should have flown against other posts also as it is an horizontal reservation in the ex-serviceman (ESM) category. Explaining the issue before the bench, petitioner’s counsel Shreenath A Khemka informed the HC that HPSC had advertised 156 vacancies for various posts for HCS examination wherein six posts were reserved for the ESM category. However, the ESM posts were vertically bifurcated between various caste categories. “The effect was to oust the petitioner’s eligibility from all but one post, that too of the assistant employment officer... the petitioner challenges the advertisement to the limited extent that it vertically bifurcates the horizontal reservation in the ESM category and prays for his consideration against all the six ESM posts,” the counsel had argued.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hc-notice-to-hpsc-chief-secy-on-plea-against-hcs-exam-quota-policy/articleshow/81594917.cms||---

The average wholesale onion prices have dropped by 64% in just the past 19 days — from Rs 2,640 per quintal on March 1 to Rs 950 per quintal on Friday — due to the rise in supply. “The daily volume of onions arriving at Lasalgaon, which was around 10,000 quintal 10 days ago, has increased to 30,000 quintal. Roughly 1.10 lakh quintal of onions was auctioned at Lasalgaon between March 16 and 19,” said the APMC officials. “There has been a rise in supply of onions, but the demand has been comparatively low in the domestic as well as the international markets due to the pandemic. Consumption of onions in restaurants and hotels has reduced drastically. That is why the average wholesale onion prices have dropped,” said Manoj Jain, onion trader. Usually, the late kharif onions stop coming in by February-end. But the plantation of late kharif onions was delayed due to rain this year. Therefore, the arrival of late kharif onions is still in full swing. Moreover, the arrival of fresh summer onions have also started.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/wholesale-onion-price-at-rs-950/quintal/articleshow/81592477.cms||Tushar Pawar

I did not crawl,” said chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami on Friday taking exception to DMK president M K Stalin’s jibe that he crawled before V K Sasikala to become chief minister. At an election rally in Bhuvanagiri constituency, Palaniswami said, “They (political rivals) thought the AIADMK will split after the death of Amma (Jayalalithaa) and the government will fall. But it did not happen. That irked them and led them to pass such remarks. They could not digest the fact that a farmer like me became chief minister. I am in this position because of the support of the people and God’s blessings. I did not crawl to move. I walked (to the stage) to be sworn in as chief minister.” Palaniswami said Stalin had not spelt out the DMK’s plans for the state and its people, but instead attacked him round-the-clock.”Whereas we are seeking votes by highlighting the achievements of the government in the last two terms and listing out the party’s proposals for the state and its people for the future. Stalin spreads lies wherever he goes. He has launched round-the-clock tirade against me. I don’t know why he is annoyed whenever I say I am a farmer,” he said. He held the DMK government headed by M Karunanidhi responsible for the Cauvery water dispute with Karnataka and accused it of failing to prevent construction of a dam across the river Kabini by the neighbouring state. “Tamil Nadu lost its fair share of Cauvery water after Karnataka build the dam,” he said and added that AIADMK led by Jayalalithaa restored the rights of TN farmers by obtaining the state’s fair rightful share of Cauvery water by taking the judicial route.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/am-i-a-snake-or-a-lizard-im-a-human-being-didnt-crawl/articleshow/81594911.cms||Bosco Dominique

---||Lucknow||We transformed UP from ‘Bimaru’ to a ‘samarth’ state: Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: Marking his government’s fourth year in office on Friday, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said that they had lifted Uttar Pradesh from its status as a ‘Bimaru’ state to one which was ‘samarth’ (capable), using the mantra of “reform, perform, transform”. “Four years back when a resident of UP used to go out, people used to look at him with suspicion because he was coming from a state where there was no law and order, where corruption ruled and where there was anarchy. Now the situation is such that a person from UP is greeted with respect. The perception of its people, the government and its representatives has changed. UP has emerged as the second strongest economy in the country,” he said. The state government will be organising programmes to mark the completion of its four years in power for a week. On Friday, the CM launched a book and a song to mark the event and inaugurated an exhibition showcasing the state government’s work over the past four years. Attacking the opposition for having failed to implement any of the Narendra Modi-led Central government schemes, the CM said that UP was lagging behind on every parameter but since he came to power, the state’s ranking had improved significantly. “The Lok Kalyan Sankalp Patra we issued ahead of the 2017 elections was as sacred as the Geeta for us and we tried to implement every single promise we made in it. Under the PM Awas Yojana, we have given houses to 40 lakh poor people in rural and urban areas and are ranked first among all states. Till 2017, the previous government had managed to construct 45 lakh toilets under Swachh Bharat and UP was ranked 27th. In a year and a half, we declared UP open defecation free by constructing 2.61 crore toilets,” he said. Infrastructure development was totally missing, he said, adding that as soon as one drove into UP before 2017, they only encountered potholes. People preferred walking, he said, and one could not determine whether the stretch was a road or a field. In monsoon, he said, one could plant paddy in the potholes because they were so deep. Hitting out at Samajwadi Party, the CM said: “Azamgarh propelled SP to power on so many occasions but during their rule, people from Azamgarh were viewed with suspicion. When they went to Mumbai, hotels would refuse them rooms when they learnt that they were from Azamgarh. Now Azamgarh is known not for terrorism but for development. It is going to get a new airport and a state university.” Invoking the Ramayana, the CM said that thousands of years earlier when Lord Ram returned to Ayodhya after having defeated Ravana, he came to Chitrakoot on a Pushpak Viman. “It is shameful that even after thousands of years, this area did not have air connectivity. Now we are building an airport here." The CM also said that his government had a zero tolerance policy towards crime, which had gone a long way in changing the perception of UP and making it a hub of investments. “A criminal is a criminal. He has no caste or religion. The government will act against a criminal in the best way it can to do whatever is necessary for the welfare of the 24 crore people of this state,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/yogi-we-transformed-up-from-bimaru-to-a-samarth-state/articleshow/81595926.cms||Neha Lalchandani

The Indian Penal Code (IPC) as well as the special legislative law (SLL) crimes reduced by 1.5% and 0.69%, respectively, in 2019 as against 2018. While the rate of crime against women (i.e. crimes per 1 lakh women population) was 63.06% in the state, Amravati city recorded the highest rate of crime against women at 142.55%.Mumbai recorded the most number of cases of crimes against women at 6,519. Serious offences like murder, dacoity and property matters were less in 2019 compared to 2018. “The state’s 2019 annual crime statistic report, which would have come by the end of 2020 in the normal course, got delayed partly on account of the delay in release of the ‘National Crime Record Bureau’s Crime in India Report for 2019’ and the Covid-19 pandemic,” Pallavi Barge, the CID’s superintendent of police (law and research) told TOI. The CID 2019 report said dacoity cases have declined by 20.03% in 2019 as against 2018. Cases of robbery have increased by 4.48% as against 2018.

A total 891 graft cases were registered against public servants in 2019.Barge said, “Crimes under certain categories like robberies, crime against women and SC/ST communities are on the rise every year because of factors like increase in population, poverty and social causes. The general crime falling in other categories has reduced partly because of increased police presence during the 2019 state assembly elections.”The CID had reported 20% rise in IPC crimes across Maharashtra in 2018 as compared to 2017 in its Crime in Maharashtra-2017 report released on September 4, 2020.

He was not at his residence at and his whereabouts were not known despite Pasalkar trying to trace him before approaching the police. We worked on certain clues and took Arankalle into custody from his hideout at Vadodara in Gujarat following a tip-off. He was brought to Pune,” said senior inspector Jagganath Kalaskar of the Bharati Vidyapeeth police on Friday.He said, “Pasalkar from Ambegaon Budruk had secured Rs87 lakh loan from banks and acquaintances, and gave it to Arankalle for starting the business as the demand for vegetables had increased after the lockdown was enforced. Arankalle did not start the partnership firm, but he collected vegetables from Pasalkar and sold them in the local market between June and August. He delayed the payment of commission to Pasalkar after selling vegetables on one pretext or another.”Kalaskar said, “Arankalle later repaid Rs3 lakh to Pasalkar and sought time to return the balance of Rs84 lakh. The suspect told the police that he ran a restaurant at Ambegaon Khurd in partnership, but it closed down after the lockdown was enforced.”He said, “The suspect later found good opportunity in selling vegetables because its demand had increased after the lockdown was enforced. He then came out with a novel idea to launch a business firm on partnership for selling agriculture produces directly procured from farmers. He lured Pasalkar to give the capital and duped him.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/man-arrested-on-charge-of-cheating-biz-partner-of-rs-84l/articleshow/81593746.cms||---
---||Pune||Crook uses QR code trick, dupes student of Rs 24,000||Pune: A cybercrook cashed in on a student’s naivete and siphoned off Rs24,000 from her father’s bank account. The incident occurred in December last year, when the 19-year-old MBBS aspirant was trying to sell some old textbooks online. The girl’s father initially approached the cybercrime cell. Once his complaint was verified, an FIR was registered with the Pimpri police on Thursday. As per the FIR, the complainant’s daughter — currently pursuing her medical degree — posted an online advertisement to sell books she had purchased to prepare for the National Eligibility and Entrance Test (NEET). The complainant told TOI that a stranger contacted his daughter and said he was interested in buying the books. “He told my daughter to send him Rs5 online and promised to return Rs10, which he did immediately,” he said. The complainant said the suspect then sent his daughter a QR code, telling her to scan it to receive payment for the books. “I was outside, and my smartphone was with my daughter, who scanned the code. Money got debited from my account,” he said. When the girl told the crook what happened, he sent her another QR code to refund the money. “My daughter scanned it again and more money was debited,” he said. “The man frightened my daughter into scanning two more QR codes, claiming there was a time limit to get the money back. By the time I returned, Rs24,000 got debited from my account,” he said. An officer from the Pimpri police said their probe into the complaint has revealed that the money was transferred to an account linked to a UPI ID registered in Jharkhand. “The caller too was from there,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/crook-uses-qr-code-trick-dupes-student-of-rs-24000/articleshow/81593749.cms||Mihir Tanksale

Twenty-two leaders, who include MPs and other senior leaders, have already been sent to Assam, while a team of 11 more leaders, who include MLAs, former MPs and and ministers, shall be sent to West Bengal as well. “Leaders have been shortlisted on demands raised by central election offices and campaigning committees. These two states have a sizeable population of traders and farmers having roots in Haryana, or are directly or indirectly linked to Haryana. Hence, our leaders will campaign there,” said Dhankar. Dhankar said since MLAs and ministers were busy in the state assembly’s budget session, hence it took time for the party to decide upon names. BJP is the only national party which has sent teams to Assam and West Bengal. As of now, it were only farmer leaders and members of Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), who include Gurnam Singh Charuni, Rakesh Tikait and Yogendera Yadava, who had been campaigning in poll-bound states against BJP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/bjps-haryana-unit-sending-leaders-to-poll-bound-bengal-assam/articleshow/81594924.cms||Manvir Saini

Since learning about the presence of the wild cat, forest department authorities have started keeping an eye on its movement. Additional principal chief conservator of forest Sunil Limaye told TOI, “The tiger was first caught on camera in the sanctuary on March 15. We are keeping a close track on its movements.” The big cat’s latest image was captured in a trap camera sometime in the wee hours of Friday. Forest officials believe the male tiger to be above two years of age and is suspected of covering a distance of about 240 sq km before reaching the sanctuary jointly shared by the districts of Aurangabad and Jalgaon. The authorities are checking if the tiger has come from Tipeshwar wildlife sanctuary situated in Pandarkawada of Yavatmal district or from Dnyanganga wildlife sanctuary in Botha Ghat of Buldhana district. Recently there were reports of a fully grown tiger suspiciously missing from Buldhana, therefore, the forest department authorities are checking if it is the same tiger. The development came to fore about a week ago when a wild life enthusiast Tushar Pawar spotted pug marks of tiger in Gautala Autram wildlife sanctuary that houses several wild animals, including leopards. Soon, he alerted the forest authorities, resulting into installation of a series of trap cameras in the area where the big cat’s footprints were first spotted. Prior to Pawar, one of the forest department staffers, too, had alerted the authorities about the pugmark lookalike marks he spotted in the interior areas of the sanctuary, but the input did not see any further development.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/tiger-spotted-in-gautala-autram-sanctuary/articleshow/81592495.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The rule will be in force till March 31. Cinema halls, auditoriums, theatres and restaurants were allowed to resume business in November last year but at 50% capacity. Also, private offices will be allowed to continue functioning at 50% capacity by following Covid19 norms, while in case of government and semi-government sector, the office head will decide on attendance and ensure adherence to protocols. The manufacturing sector can work at full capacity. However, industries are advised to reduce workforce to ensure social distancing. And for purposes of maintaining social distancing, they may be allowed to increase shifts with approval from authorities. Gujarati actress Sujata Mehta said, “Private halls, like the one in Prime Mall in Vile Parle and others in Malad are operating at 50% capacity only. We have held shows in the Parle hall with just 40-45 people where capacity is 90. We even denied entry to patrons once that capacity was crossed and they had to return. We have two shows coming up on Saturday-Sunday, and we are upturning each alternate chair to keep physical distance.

Speaking to reporters in Nandurbar, the rural district that has registered the highest growth rate (over 300%) in the state in the last 15 days, Thackeray said the situation has become grimmer. “I see lockdown as an option going ahead. But I trust people of the state to cooperate (and follow norms voluntarily) like the last time,” he said . In Mumbai, the record tally of 3,063 detections prompted BMC chief Iqbal Singh Chahal to announce doubling of daily testing capacity to 50,000, using random tests at crowded places. Read AlsoCovid count tops 40k after 111 days, biggest rise in active cases since SeptemberIndia's daily cases of Covid-19 crossed the 40,000 mark for the first time in 111 days as the sharp surge in the pandemic continued on Friday, with as many as 17 states and Union territories adding the highest number of infections since January or earlier. Active cases had risen to nearly 2.9 lakhChahal directed all government and private hospitals to increase beds for Covid patients. Mumbai’s caseload on Thursday was 2,877, a shade above its previous all-time high of 2,848 on October 10. Coronavirus in India: Live updatesIn neighbouring Kalyan-Dombivli, hawkers have been banned on the weekends to avoid crowding. The third consecutive day, Kalyan Dombivli reported over 500 cases. Navi Mumbai reported its highest in six months with 347 and Panvel hit a seven-month high with 238. Mumbai Metropolitan Region reported its highest cases (5,737) and deaths (19) on Friday, taking the tally to 7.8 lakh cases and fatalities to 20,028. “It is indeed the second wave,” said Dr Pradeep Awate, who heads the epidemiology cell of Maharashtra’s public health department. “We have crossed the previous daily high of 25,000 cases, cases are multiplying quickly, pointing to the second wave,” he said. Daily test positivity rate in Maharashtra is over 20% despite over 1.2 lakh tests conducted on Thursday. The state accounts for over 65% of India’s daily caseload. With Friday’s score of 25,681 cases and 70 fatalities, Maharashtra now has an overall caseload of 24.22 lakh cases and 53,208 deaths. But there is a silver lining to the second wave, said Dr Awate, the case fatality rate has dropped from 2.47% in October to 0.44% now. “It is low virulence, but a speedier wave,” he added. The second wave has hit several countries between September and December 2020, but India had evaded it then. “We had anticipated the second wave in December last week or January first week, but due to stringent policies the wave was delayed. As soon as restrictions were removed in February, the numbers rose sharply in Maharashtra,” said state Covid-19 task force member Dr Shashank Joshi, who on Friday tweeted that the second wave is here. While there is a fear that Maharashtra’s second wave will spill over to the rest of the country, Dr Joshi said India could still stall it with stringent public health policies such as micro-containment and fines for Covid-inappropriate behavior. “We need a circuit-breaker to contain this second wave. We need to de-clutter and de-crowd to avoid a second lockdown,” he added. Maharashtra public health minister Rajesh Tope said the spike was a matter of serious concern and districts have been told to increase testing. “It is clear that the virus is more infectious, but the death rate hasn't gone up. We are now finding cases where the entire family has been infected, but most of them were asymptomatic,” said Tope. Meanwhile, Dharavi reported 29 Covid cases though over 70% of them are asymptomatic. Dharavi in March has reported only one death so far. “Number of cases are rising due to proactive testing and screening. We are detecting the cases at early stages enabling them for early treatment,” said BMC G North ward in-charge Kiran Dighavkar.

Speaking to reporters in Nandurbar, the rural district that has registered the highest growth rate (over 300%) in the state in the last 15 days, Thackeray said the situation has become grimmer. “I see lockdown as an option going ahead.

---||Aurangabad||Teachers called for antigen tests made to wait for hours in Aurangabad||Aurangabad: The 150 teachers, who were shortlisted as invigilators for the Maharashtra Public Service Commission (MPSC) exams scheduled on Sunday, were left fuming after they had to wait for hours before they could finally undergo antigen tests. The state has made it mandatory for the invigilators to undergo antigen testing and only those who test negative will be allowed to perform invigilator duties. Rapid antigen testing is considered one of the easier ways to screen people when carrying out other tests (like RT-PCR) may not be possible due to time constraints The teachers have alleged that they were asked to report to the Sant Tukaram auditorium in the Cidco area at 9 am on Friday. However, the health department employees turned up almost after a couple of hours. Moreover, the health authorities had deployed just one team, led by a doctor named Rahul Kokate, to test the 150 teachers. “On one hand the authorities are appealing to the masses to abstain from gathering at one place. On the other, they are calling so many teachers and making them wait at a location for hours,” said a teacher working with an aided school. The teachers alleged that the testing process was carried out at a very slow pace and as a result they had to wait for hours. The medical team came late and started carrying out the tests one by one. Despite repeated attempts, the Kokate could not be reached for his comments. Another teacher said that they were informed that the antigen testing will be carried out in batches of 10. “When we reached the venue, we found that all the 150 teachers were called at the same time,” the teacher said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/teachers-called-for-antigen-tests-made-to-wait-for-hours-in-aurangabad/articleshow/81592507.cms||Mohammed Akhef

It asked the government to pay him the amount within three months. S Rajamanickam of Perambur said that on December 22, 2018, he slipped and fell on a footpath and suffered a fracture on his left knee. He was operated on January 2, 2019, at KMC and was discharged a week later. Since he was not entirely cured, he once again went to KMC on January 29, 2019. He was then admitted as an inpatient and underwent another operation. This time too he was not fully cured, and so he went to Stanley Medical College Hospital. Doctors there allegedly told him that the earlier surgeries were not done properly. He alleged that due to medical negligence of doctors at Kilpauk Medical College Hospital, he was not fully cured and so, lost his ability to work. Doctors at KMC submitted a report denying the allegation and said, “Though proper treatment was given to the complainant, due to general complications the complainant was not fully cured. Therefore, there has not been any violation of human rights of the complainant, and the complaint filed against the doctors should be dismissed.” The commission said though they may reject the allegations of the complainant regarding medical negligence, still the complainant deserves to be paid Rs 3 lakh as compensation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/shrc-tells-govt-to-pay-labourer-rs-3l/articleshow/81594970.cms||---

The I-T department said the business group was engaged in yarn trading and supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) kits, bags and baby care kits to various state governments. “The searches revealed that the group is engaged in the practice of suppressing profit by inflating purchases and other expenses. The unaccounted income so generated is utilized for making investments in land and expansion of busines,” the I-T department statement.  I-T searches were also conducted at five premises in Chennai of five different entities, which resulted in cash seizure of Rs 5.32 crore.  The I-T department said seizure of large quantities of unaccounted cash would reduce the possibility of its utilization for electoral purposes and would aid the objective of free and fair polls in Tamil Nadu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/i-t-seizes-rs-11cr-in-simultaneous-raids-in-3-cities/articleshow/81594996.cms||---
---||Nagpur||End restrictions, plead daily wagers at wildlife resorts||NAGPUR: The ongoing clampdown on movement in Nagpur district has certainly hit the economy hard but it has even hit worst to those surviving on daily wages, including workers involved in wildlife tourism. Right from waiters and dishwashers in resorts, to jungle safari guides and drivers - all wanted the restrictions to end immediately. Bhaktraj Morde, a native of Pauni village, still trembles when recalls what happened to his family during last year’s lockdown. “For months there was no source of income for us, as we didn’t have farmland either. We survived feeding on stored, borrowed and donated rations. Then one after the other, my wife and I were diagnosed with jaundice but there was no way to reach the hospital due to lack of vehicles in our village. We both just lay on the bed the entire day and my old parents took care of my child,” said Morde. He added “Lockdown is hell for poor people like us.” Deepak Wahane is a guide in Pench who says his income has ‘crashed’ since beginning of March. “I barely get one or two safaris a week and earn Rs 300 per trip. That’s only income I have to scrape by now,” Wahane said. He said that till 2019, he would get minimum five trips a week during peak season. “I have to feed my family, my children but it seems this lockdown is going to turn us into beggars,” said Wahane, who hails from Pipariya. “Before 1999, when most of this area was not a tiger reserve, we could get civil work at Totladoh etc. But now there’s nothing else for us to do, no other way to feed our children,” Wahane said. Mahendra Verma, who drives a tourist gypsy, is now worried about repaying his vehicle loan. “My EMI is 14,000 per month and I struggled to pay it last year as well. I am able to get only two trips per week for which I get paid Rs 2,000 each time. On Tuesday afternoon, we did not have even a single tourist here. So there’s no way I will be able cover my EMI let alone providing for my family. If this lockdown does not end now, we will be on the streets,” Verma said. Kamlesh Uikey and his father survive on employment provided by resorts. “I am a waiter and my father does any odd job he gets here. Last year both of us had to return to Ramtek and we sat at home without any income. Now finally things were looking up since January this year, but again government has ordered the lockdown,” Uikey said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/end-restrictions-plead-daily-wagers-at-wildlife-resorts/articleshow/81594979.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

The accused, Mohammed Shafi Ibrahimkhil, arrived at the RGI Airport from Kabul via Sharjah by an Air Arabia flight in the last week of February. At immigration, Shafi said that he was on a medical visa for treatment at Sarvodaya Health Care hospital in Faridabad. As hisreplies were unsatisfactory, immigration officials checked his cabin baggage and found an Aadhaar card with his photo carrying the name Safiullah. The address in the card was Lajpat Nagar, South Delhi. Shafi confessed that during his previous visit to India in 2016, he obtained the Aadhaar card.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/afghan-man-arrested-with-fake-aadhaar/articleshow/81594968.cms||---
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Poll merchandise turns contemporary, cellphone covers, night lamps are faves||CHENNAI: Strict enforcement against voter bribing and the short time between announcement of election and polling have led to political parties in Tamil Nadu shopping for cell phone covers and night lamps over traditional “gifts” of ‘kudam’ (pot), T-shirts and saris. The election notification for the April 6 election was issued on February 26.  Sale of mobile phone covers and cases and night lamps with imprints of logos of almost all political party symbols including national outfits has grown by more than 30%, says Karthic Gurnani, founder of e-commerce dropshipping platform Baapstore. On the other hand, Chennai-based JK Stainless, a wholesaler, has seen orders for ‘kudams’ and cookers down by 30% with the Election Commission trying to keep a hawk eye over political parties. An employee at the store said, “While the demand for cookers and pots has gone down sharply, the price of these have risen by 25% to 30%.” It is common practice for candidates touring their constituencies to distribute ‘gifts’, to keep filed workers in good humour and to butter up voters. The ‘gifts’, when not accounted, go into the EC records as ‘bribes’. “The runway time from announcement to poll is short. Some parties have picked up T-shirts, but overall, sales have plummeted. Besides, the costs have risen too. A simple T-shirt used to cost around Rs 70. It now costs Rs 110 a piece,” said Tirupur Exporters Association president Raja Shammugam. DMK worker Constantine Ravindran says spending on election merchandise has significantly reduced. But there’s still good demand for printed mobile phone covers and cases, bluetooth headsets and night lamps. Tirupur-based Bhaskar V, proprietor of Vijay Sports that sells custom-made T-shirts, caps and towels for political parties, says orders are down by 50% due to stringent restrictions. Two political parties had placed orders for Rs 7 lakh worth of T-shirts each this year, which is half the previous election’s sales. “We are already facing hardships in terms of order cancellations and margins being hit owing to the yarn price hike. With limited demand, it is impossible to see a decent profit margin,” said Bhaskar. On an average, T-shirts are priced at Rs 100-Rs 300 apiece, caps at Rs 30 and towels at Rs 25-Rs 30 apiece. Vedha V, a 61-year-old Chennai resident, said that people in her neighbourhood had in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, we received freebies like cookers, saris and veshtis from political parties. “There’s hardly anyone at our doorstep this year. Looks like the EC’s strict vigilance is as big a scare as the coronavirus itself. It seems to have scared off even the Tamil Nadu politicians,” she joked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/poll-merchandise-turns-contemporary-cellphone-covers-night-lamps-are-faves/articleshow/81594966.cms||Mamtha Asokan
---||Bhopal||Travellers from Maharashtra told to isolate themselves for a week||BHOPAL: People entering MP from Maharashtra are being asked to isolate or quarantine themselves for seven days after the sudden spurt in Covid cases. The district administration will keep a watch on the movement of such people. The movement of buses from Maharashtra has been stopped, but personal vehicles continued to cross the border of both states. Officials said thermal screening has also been increased in the districts touching Maharashtra border including Chhindwara, Balaghat, Seoni, Khandwa, Barwani, Khargone, Burhanpur and Betul. However, the biggest challenge for the authorities is to keep tabs on the citizens entering from Maharashtra border. “We have advised citizens to isolate themselves for a week. Instructions have been issued to spread the message all across the cities touching Maharashtra border,” said a district administration official. The movement at the Maharashtra border is still high. “People are in panic and they want to reach their home as early as possible,” said Prashant Sharma, a traveller. Around 75 passenger buses pass daily from Betul to the Maharashtra border. “This is enough to gauge the movement of travellers. Even the people travelling to other neighbouring states like Andhra Pradesh and Chhattisgarh take the route of Betul-Nagpur highway. In such situation, the affected population on this border is quite high,” said a transport department official not wishing to be named. Several travellers have cancelled their trips. “We had planned to go to Chikaldhara. To reach there, we had to use the Betul-Nagpur highway. We have cancelled the plan after buses were stopped. The situation is very uncertain as no one wants to be in trouble,” said Ashish Soni, a Bhopal-based businessman. Sources said that the transport department may extend the prohibition of bus movement even after March 31. “The situation is very dicey. The administration has kept a close wacth on the ongoing situation. As of now, buses are stopped till March 31. It could be extended further, depending on the situation,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/travellers-from-maha-told-to-isolate-themselves-for-a-wk/articleshow/81593786.cms||---

If we don’t, things will go out of hand.” He said use of masks, maintenance of physical distance and getting the vaccine shots are the only steps that can be taken to save people from falling prey to the infection. Kulkarni, who has been at the forefront of the pandemic control efforts, said unless citizens decide to cooperate and take preventive measures, all efforts by the administration as well as the government will fall flat. He went on to warn that if things go out of hand, scaling up infrastructure will also not be adequate. Currently, the positivity rate of Aurangabad is 23%. Aurangabad district collector Sunil Chavan said earlier the positivity rate was 30%, which now has come down. In September 2020, during the first wave of the pandemic, Aurangabad had reported a highest-daily case count of 489. In the first week of March, on average more than 400 cases were being reported. However, the average daily case count has been breaching the 1,000-mark over the past five days. In fact, on Thursday, more than 1500 new cases were reported in Aurangabad. “The number of cases is going up. If the current trend continues, our resources will be overstretched. Eventually, things may go out of hand,” said Kulkarni.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-civil-surgeon-wary-of-rise-in-covid-tally/articleshow/81592502.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Chennai||3 observatories to monitor coral bleaching||Chennai: With coral bleaching becoming a serious cause of concern, three permanent observatories will be set up in Gulf of Mannar, Lakshadweep and Andaman Islands to track and monitor the health and resilience of corals. Chennai-based National Centre for Coastal Research (NCCR) will set up the observatories and use the data to figure out long-term mitigation measures. The observatories will be set up in the next three months. NCCR director M V Ramana Murthy said these observatories will help them undertake studies on coral resilience in the face of climate change. “Earlier, we didn’t have a continuous monitoring process. So, when bleaching happened, we could not find out why it had happened, or why the sea temperature went up,” he said. “But if we set up an observatory, we will know what were the conditions under which a bleaching event happened and the conditions under which the corals regenerated. This is what we call resilience and when we have a better understanding of that, we can make mitigation plans,” he said. The observatories will be permanent structures, unlike the buoys off Chennai coast, used to measure coastal water quality. NCCR researchers said these observatories will measure all critical climate change and water quality parameters like sea surface temperature, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll, blue algae, and water level variations. Researchers will also dive deep to collect underwater data periodically. The NCCR director said the data from the observatories will be validated with satellite data. “Whenever our people visit the sites for sampling, they also carry underwater cameras to capture images from the same locations to see the difference over a period,” Ramana Murthy said. NCCR, which monitors the country’s coastal water quality, has a field office in Mandapam, from where a research team monitors 128 coral species in the 21 islands at Gulf of Mannar and Palk Bay region. In 2018, the lab started coral restoration work in the Hare and Manoli islands, where polyps were tied to small concrete slabs on an iron frame and placed at 3m depth. After they grew up for six months, they were transplanted in the surrounding area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/3-observatories-to-monitor-coral-bleaching/articleshow/81595007.cms||U Tejonmayam

The 100 thus appointed have been equipped with laptops. Also, the civic body plans to add 38 vaccination centres to the existing 72. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B told TOI that the staff has been divided equally among the 10 zones. “Officials at zone offices with the help of NGOs, social organizations and public representatives will arrange special camps for registration which will be attended by the staff. This will help in expediting vaccination, reduce waiting time of beneficiaries at centres and prevent crowding,” he said. The civic chief said the staff has already started working in four zones on Friday and will begin in the remaining six from Saturday. Radhakrishnan also said a proposal seeking permission to allow vaccination centres at 30 private hospitals not empanelled under government schemes was sent to the government on Friday. “At present, we are operating vaccination centres in 14 of total 26 urban primary health centres (UPHCs). Vaccination will begin at more eight UPHCs,” he said. The NMC has observed that people residing in nearby areas rush to a vaccination centre as soon as it opens. “Gradually, the number reduces. This surely means people do not want to travel far for getting the jab. The 38 new centres, which should begin functioning from next week, and the existing ones are spread across all areas. In case any area is remaining, we will shift an existing centre which has fewer beneficiaries,” said Radhakrishnan. Of the 72 centres, 45 are in private hospitals and 27 in NMC and government-run hospitals and UPHCs. Zilla parishad CEO Yogesh Kumbhejkar had successfully implemented a similar programme in the rural parts last week. Centres were increased to 85 of which 69 are in government hospitals and primary health centres (PHCs) and 16 in private hospitals. Vaccination started in all PHCs. Apart from this, ZP engaged staff of gram panchayat and anganwadi sevikas who started to visit houses, inform residents about the vaccination programme, note done details of eligible people and link them with nearby PHCs. In city, number of beneficiaries was 11,207 on March 13. Since then, the numbers are on the decline. A 10,398 took the jab on March 15 followed by 9,061 on March 16, 8,445 on March 17, 7,538 on March 18 and 8,725 on March 19. The rural areas has seen a climb. A 6,513 took the jab on March 13 followed by 9,885 on March 15, 10,640 on March 17 and 10,729 on March 19. PHCs are not doing vaccination on regular immunization of children on Tuesdays and Thursdays.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-to-send-staff-to-residential-areas-for-vax-registration/articleshow/81593803.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

As on Friday, 6,690 people were under treatment, while the total case tally touched 8,64,450. With nine people dying across the state on Friday, the death toll went up to 12,582. The directorate of public health in Tamil Nadu last reported cases in four digits on December 28, 2020, when there were 8,867 people under treatment. The following day, the state had 957 fresh cases. On Friday, when Chennai reported 421 cases and four deaths, the district had 2,552 people under treatment. “On January 1, the city had 2,528 active cases. At that time, despite seeing clusters of cases from educational institutions, we were reporting around 252 fresh cases a day. The fresh cases dropped to less than 150 a day until mid-Febraury. After that, clusters began to increase as fewer people adhered to pandemic protocols,” health secretary J Radhakrishnan said. The average number of cases reported every day in Chennai, which was around 144 between February 12 and 18, increased to 152 a week later. Last week, the average number of cases reported by the city was around 250, and from March 12-18 around 326 cases were reported every day. During the same period there was an increase in the total number of Covid deaths. In the week between February 12 and 18, the state reported 12 deaths and between March 12 and 18, the city reported 17 deaths. The fatality rate in the state is stable at 1.5% since September 2020. Along with Chennai, cases in Chengalpet also increased. The Chennai region – Chennai, Tiruvallur, Kancheepuram and Chengalpet – together reported 60% of the total cases in the state on Friday. After Chennai, Chengalpet reported the highest number of cases and deaths. The district reported 105 new cases and two deaths. Tiruvallur and Kancheepuram reported 78 and 37 cases respectively.

---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Now, app to help report poll code violations anonymously||CHENNAI: If you have a complaint against a candidate or a political party for violating model code of conduct, you now have an anonymous option to get it recorded, track its progress and get it resolved, through the cVigil app of the Election Commission of India. Citizens can capture photos or videos in real-time of the violation and send as evidence while filing a short descriptive report of the incident. The app automatically forwards it to the respective district control room, from where it is flagged to the flying squad teams who are able to reach the spot quickly thanks to the live location tracking feature of the app. Users can also track the status of their complaint. State election officials TOI spoke to said that in Chennai district alone, as of Friday, around 82 complaints had been received on the cVigil app out of which 75 had been cleared, two were in progress of investigation, and five were dropped for not meeting violation norms. The complaints received were in the nature of public defacement, banner placements, disrupting public life among others. Details of complaints received on cVigil from across TN could not be ascertained. The cVigil (stands for Vigilant Citizens) app is available on both Android and Apple app stores and can be used to report MCC or expenditure related violations using photos and videos. It provides a time-stamped evidence of the misdeed, making it reliable for officials to take swift action. The app promises results within 100 minutes. Complaints ranging from distribution of money, gifts, liquor, posters and banner placements, and property defacements can be made via the app. Booth capturing on the day of polls and other campaigning during the ban period can also be reported. Despite being beneficial, cVigil is seeing muted adoption in Tamil Nadu- a state notorious for rampant voter bribing. “The use is picking up. We are receiving more complaints from citizens on the app rather than toll free telephone lines thanks to the increase in use of smartphones and photos and video communication,” an official said. Chennai-based activist Jayaram Venkatesan said the app was promoted very heavily by the election commission in earlier years but awareness and marketing seems to be low in the current elections. The app was first piloted in the Lok Sabha election of 2019 across states. As per the Election Commission of India, 1.42 lakh cases were reported on the cVigil app nationally and around 1.1 lakh cases were found correct and addressed at that time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/now-app-to-help-report-poll-code-violations-anonymously/articleshow/81595004.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

---||Delhi||In Drive To Reclaim Ridge, Site In Dera Mandi Cleared||New Delhi: After removal of encroachments in parts of Asola, Bhatti, Neb Sarai and Maidan Garhi recently, the forest department carried out a demolition drive in Dera Mandi village on Friday with the assistance of Delhi Police and revenue officials. Officials say they are now moving fast and large chunks of Southern Ridge, which have illegal buildings or structures, will face action. TOI reached one such site on Friday near Dera Mandi village, which was largely being used to store construction materials. At least 20 earthmovers were brought in to reclaim a large expanse of land near the Delhi-Haryana border. Small rooms had been built for storage purposes after flattening the area completely. “The area forms a part of the Ridge, however illegal work has been going on for years now. Several trees may have been cut and the rocky landscape was first flattened and then structures were built. There are multiple rooms for storage and sleeping,” said a forest official. While locals initially questioned the demarcation process, teams from Delhi Police and the forest department showed the new maps drawn after the procedure was completed in 2019. Police assistance, along with security guards, are sought in the areas where the threat of locals attacking the department is high, said a senior forest official. “A meeting was held with the subdivisional magistrate last year and we requested the distract task force and police to assist us,” the official added. A joint status report submitted by the forest department to National Green Tribunal recently, in compliance with its order, stated that survey maps had been prepared for 19 villages and these are helping the department depict the exact status of the land, including green areas, encroachment-free land and land falling under Delhi government. Forest officials said densely populated areas such as Saidulajaib, Pul Pehladpur, Neb Sarai, Prem Nagar, Lal Kuan and some parts of Aya Nagar had also been identified, with encroachment removal drives taking place more frequently now. “The cleared locations are fenced off and the land is reclaimed. These villages are being notified as forest land too,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/in-drive-to-reclaim-ridge-site-in-dera-mandi-cleared/articleshow/81595020.cms||---

The ruling BJP in Jalgaon Municipal Corporation (JMC) witnessed an unexpected defeat in the mayoral polls. BJP had won 57 of the 75 seats in JMC while Sena could win only 15 seats in the civic body elections held in 2018. Despite this, during the mayoral polls held on Thursday, Sena managed to bag 27 votes from BJP corporators and three votes from AIMIM corporators. The suspension orders and show-cause in this regard were issued by AIMIM’s state working president Dr Abdul Gaffar Quadri on Friday evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/corporators-suspended-for-cross-voting/articleshow/81592510.cms||Mohammed Akhef

---||Aurangabad||Demand for oxygen picks but lesser than last year||CLEARED SKHER Aurangabad: The number of Covid cases in Aurangabad has seen a steady rise over the past few days and is reflecting in the demand for oxygen, though it has not reached the peak observed in September last year. The demand for oxygen is comparatively lower than what it was during the peak period in September last year. In September 2020, Aurangabad had reported 489 cases in a single day and had total 5,000 active cases. In the same month, the daily requirement of oxygen was 24 metric tonne, the highest consumption since the pandemic broke out. Presently, there are about 9,000 active cases under treatment with an addition of over 1,000 cases daily in the district. The total consumption of oxygen is 21 metric tonnes per day in the district. The supply is being done to 45 private as well as government hospitals giving treatment to Covid-19 patients. Health officials said that the comparatively lesser demand for oxygen indicates that the total number of critically ill patients currently under treatment is less. On Sunday, Aurangabad reported 1,023 cases, followed by 1,228 on Monday, 1,271 on Tuesday, 1,335 on Wednesday, 1,557 on Thursday. Food and drug administration’s joint director Sanjay Kale said, “We are closely monitoring the daily consumption of oxygen as well as important drugs like remdesivir. The current trend shows that the demand for oxygen is going up.” District administration authorities maintained that the oxygen storage capacity has already been improved and if need be, it will be further improved. Aurangabad district collector Sunil Chavan said, “We have close to 60 metric tonnes available in the storage.” He said that the daily consumption as well as daily refilling is being monitored and not taking any chance, a considerable amount of oxygen, in liquid as well as gaseous form, is being maintained in the storage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/demand-for-oxygen-picks-but-lesser-than-last-year/articleshow/81592514.cms||Mohammed Akhef

---||Nagpur||Aiming at ring vaccination, NMC proposes vax at 35 more pvt hosps||Nagpur: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) on Friday prepared a list of 35 non-empanelled hospitals with 20 or more beds, to start Covid inoculation centres, targetting ring vaccination across the city. As on date, the civic body has 74 private inoculation centres in addition to 27 government and civic facilities across the city. NMC chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar said the civic body has sent a proposal to state the government, which will forward it to the central government for approval. “Ring vaccination is part of new Covid containment project. If there is one positive patient and all others in the periphery are vaccinated, then the disease doesn’t propagate. Hence, we want to vaccinate as many citizens as possible at the earliest,” he said. If approved, the initiative will ensure the city has an inoculation centre in each area. Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said the decision has been taken following prodding by the state government to improve the ongoing vaccination drive. “We have taken consent from 35 hospitals and forwarded the list to the state government to start the centres for wider vaccination coverage,” he said The move comes in the backdrop of Vidarbha Hospitals Association (VHA) demanding at least one centre in the radius of one km. Last week, VHA had submitted a representative to divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar and municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B, seeking permission to run inoculation centres at 10 big private hospitals. The civic body has still not received any communication about the permission for the 10 hospitals. These hospitals were initially running NMC inoculation centres on their premises for HCWs and FLWs but were abruptly stopped as they were not empanelled under any government scheme. The 35 proposed hospitals too are not empanelled. VHA convener Dr Anup Marar hailed the NMC move but said to cover more than 10,000 beneficiaries every day, there should have been at least 100 capable hospitals from first day. “It is a late step. The grouping of all high risk populace with exposed FLWs in one place was a bad plan from the start,” he said. Dr Marar added, “VHA had been repeatedly imploring authorities to include only capable hospitals having desired infrastructure like dedicated zone, sufficient waiting area, space and manpower. This would ensure distancing, cold chain adherence, ability to segregate FLWs and high risk populace. It would also help have back up of critical care services to tackle any adverse reactions. A Covid vaccination centre close by ensures high risk populace need not travel long distances and do not remain exposed for long time in queues.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/aiming-at-ring-vaccination-nmc-proposes-vax-at-35-more-pvt-hosps/articleshow/81593820.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

And this comprises two plots, 3km from the proposed temple site. The fresh acquisition at the rate of Rs 690/sqft was done to build facilities for security forces, pilgrims and to conduct activities of the Trust. Both plots located at Ram Kot and Tehri Bazaar localities in Ayodhya are owned by a Basti resident, Harish Kumar Pathak. The Ayodhya administration has been chalking out a list of houses around Ramjanmabhoomi complex, which could be bought to pave way for expansion of the Ram temple complex. The ongoing survey includes collation of ownership data of properties, which also includes Muslim houses. Secretary of Ram Mandir Trust, Champat Rai, said, “The expansion of Ramjanmabhoomi premises will be done through mutual consent and dialogue.

---||Mumbai||2-yr-old adopted ‘in exchange for money’, couple denied custody in Mumbai||Mumbai: Bombay high court on Thursday rejected a couple’s petition to restore to them custody of their adopted 2-year-old daughter from the state’s child welfare committee’s (CWC) custody. The HC rejected the couple’s contention that the toddler was taken away illegally and said it was in the “best interest of the child” that she continue to be in custody of CWC which has placed in care of a trust that runs an adoption agency. The childless couple said they had adopted a newborn from a single woman under provision of Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act through a notarised adoption deed on January 22, 2019 and also performed the child handing and naming ceremonies. That June, the CWC filed a criminal case against them and “immediately took” the child from their legal custody, they alleged. An application filed by the adoptive father for access and custody was rejected by CWC in January 2020 while another one filed by the biological mother was rejected in October that year. The CWC said the adoption deed was illegal and not registered. A bench of Justices S S Shinde and Manish Pitale held that there was no indication that the child was adopted under provisions of Hindu Adoption Act. The HC said that though the biological mother says the couple gave her Rs 20,000 for medical expense, “material on record indicates child was given away to the petitioners in exchange of money”. Thus, the HC said, CWC was “indeed justified” to take action under the Juvenile Justice Act which requires it to look after children in need of care. The couple, represented by senior counsel Raja Thakare, said the adoption was valid, the mother had willingly given up her child to them for adoption. Thakare said once there was a valid adoption under the Hindu law, provisions of Juvenile Justice (Care & Protection of Children) Act would not apply and CWC could not have stepped in. CWC’s counsel Karansingh Rajput argued that Childline, an NGO, had informed the panel on January 17 that the biological mother wanted to give the child for adoption or in some ashram. The NGO said there was a “possibility of the child being sold by the mother”. The CWC then had directed the NGO to supervise the mother. The biological mother, who worked as a domestic help, said she had entered into the adoption deed and before the HC supported the couple’s claim saying they had even helped her financially during childbirth for treatment and groceries. She had told the CWC that she had received Rs 40,000 from the couple and given the child. The couple had approached the HC later with a habeas corpus petition for CWC to be directed to produce the child. The HC said, “Nothing is sought to be placed on record to indicate that requirements of Hindu Adoption Act pertaining to a valid adoption were complied with in letter and spirit.” It said only after the FIR was filed against the adoptive father that they took such a stand, for the first time before the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/2-yr-old-adopted-in-exchange-for-money-couple-denied-custody-in-mumbai/articleshow/81573945.cms||---

Apart from their regular duties, the field workers must work on mitigation of Covid-19 -- including contact tracing, sanitisation, and vaccination drives. Sanitary officers and inspectors oversee all administrative work related to polling booths in a block. A sanitary inspector told TOI that they have to monitor activities like Electronic Voter Machine (EVM) training, giving booth slips, checking proof of disability of voters by going to their residences and coordinating with the deputy tahsildar. They also must coordinate the addition and deletion of voters, the official said. The primary role of sanitary inspectors is to visit homes of Covid-19 patients, trace contacts of the patient and supervise sanitation work in the area. “Now in vulnerable locations, we have to bring in senior citizens for vaccination as well,” the sanitary inspector said, adding that the workload has added immense pressure on the staff. Sources said an association of sanitary inspectors has submitted a representation to the GCC headquarters, highlighting their problems. A senior GCC official said that they were not involving health staff in election duty. Advocate Beula Johnson, president of a union representing the domestic breeding check (DBC) workers of GCC said that workers, who work from 6am to 2pm on their regular duties, have also been asked to bring in at least 30 people for vaccination every day. “In some zones, officials were not even been given adequate food,” she said. A senior GCC official said that an allowance of Rs 1lakh has been given to all zonal officials for such expenses. “Rs 1,200 will be given to each worker who helps in Saturday’s vaccination drive at the Jawaharlal Nehru stadium,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/covid-poll-duty-leave-corporation-staff-overburdened/articleshow/81595014.cms||---

The daily action-taken report of the past five days, a copy of which is with TOI, showed from almost 22,745 persons penalised on March 14, the numbers dropped to below 20,000 (19,003) on March 18. This, despite orders issued by the municipal commissioner following the Covid surge on February 18 to ensure at least 25,000 persons without face masks are penalised in a day. BMC commissioner I S Chahal has already stated in a circular that studies show wearing of face masks can substantially reduce the spread of the virus. Earlier this month, on March 6, around 24,809 persons were penalised and the fine collected totalled Rs 49.6 lakh. Currently, civic marshals have been deployed at crowded markets, stations and other public places such as beaches and can penalise citizens Rs 200 for not wearing masks. Mumbai police have the authority to levy the penalty too. According to civic officials, feedback received from the marshals reveals many among the middle- and upper-middle classes wear their masks. “On the other hand, those who live in chawls and slums and even vegetable and fruit vendors are very lax about putting on their face masks. We will tell the marshals to ensure they meet the target set of penalising 25,000 people a day,” said an official. Juhu corporator Renu Hansraj alleged the marshals extort money from the public. “I have already raised this issue at a recent ward committee meeting. The marshals deployed at traffic signals intimidate people in public vehicles such as autorickshaws and try to extort money from those who pull down their masks even for a bit, perhaps to get some air.” Some suggest it would be best to hand over a mask to those not wearing one instead of penalising them. Congress corporator Ravi Raja said the purpose is to ensure by wearing masks people are protected and so are those around them, thus marshals could give them masks. RTI activist Anil Galgali said clean-up marshals are seen restricting themselves to a very small area. “They should ideally move around. Simply waiting at one spot makes citizens immediately pull up their masks.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaitesting-up-but-action-against-mask-less-citizens-slows-down/articleshow/81593853.cms||Richa Pinto

---||Bhopal||Damoh bypoll a re-run of 2018 assembly elections||Bhopal: Damoh by-poll is turning to be a rerun of the 2018 assembly polls for BJP. In 2018, it was former BJP leader Ram Krishna Kusmaria who fought as a rebel against BJP candidate after being denied party ticket, this time it is former minister Jayant Malaiya’s son Siddharth. Kusmaria, though could managed to poll only 2,000 odd votes, but they were enough to ensure the defeat of BJP minister Jayant Malaiya who had lost by about 800 votes to Congress candidate Rahul Singh Lodhi. Now, the scene has changed. Lodhi joined BJP and is named as party candidate while Malaiya’s son Siddharth, who was keen on contesting from his father’s seat, is sulking and has made it clear that he may contest as an independent. In October, Lodhi resigned from Congress and joined the BJP after which by-poll was necessitated on the seat. The BJP has decided to field Lodhi from the seat again while Malaiya, who represented the seat for six times from 1990, is unwilling to give up his bastion. To contain the simmering discontentment, the BJP has appointed cabinet minister Bhupendra Singh as in-charge of affairs of Damoh assembly seat. Malaiya family had their intentions clear on several occasions and is believed to have made up their mind to fight the election to save their traditional seat. Besides, Jayant Malaiya, his son Siddharth Malaiya is an aspirant for the ticket. However, the family is still not opening its cards. Jayant Malaiya said, “I would not like to say anything at this stage” while his son Siddharth Malaiya said, “We are still hopeful that party would consider us.” The Malaiya family is already in Damoh and busy holding meetings with their supporters. Indications are Siddharth may contest the elections as an independent. Congress may also decide its candidate for the seat anytime, but the Malaiya family has refused to go with the Congress pointing that BJP is their family and the fight is, if any, it is within the family. The election commission on March 16 announced by-elections for the Damoh assembly constituency. Last date of nominations is March 30 and the last date for withdrawal of candidatures is April 3. Polling would be held on April 17 and counting of votes will take place on May 2. Political experts pointed out that trouble started on the seat before the 2018 assembly elections when Kusmaria wanted to contest from Patharia in Damoh district, but Malaiya allegedly got his ticket cancelled. Thereafter, Kusmaria decided to contest from both the seats that resulted into Malaiya’s defeat from Damoh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/damoh-bypoll-a-re-run-of-2018-assembly-elections/articleshow/81593860.cms||---

For the first time, postal ballot facility was offered to voters under the two categories to cast their votes without coming to the polling booths. According to election officials, there are roughly 71,000 voters in these two categories but majority of them opted to come to the polling booths to cast their votes. Out of the total 71,000 voters, 18,000 were ruled out because of death, migration and shifting to other localities. Rest were asked their willingness to either avail postal ballot or visit the polling booth to exercise their franchise. “Except for those who are immobile or can’t walk a short distance opted for postal votes. the rest chose to come in person as the polling booth is in the close vicinity from their residents,” said a booth level officer from Edamalaipattipudur However, there are a few elders who wish to avail postal ballots but were missed out in the survey. M Natarajan, 83 a retired staff from a PSU and his wife from Cantonment area said they wished to avail postal ballot, but none approached them. When they enquired on Friday, they were told that the process was completed on Tuesday and they may have to go to the polling booth to cast their voters. “It would be helpful for voters like me, if the election officials allowed us to register online for postal ballot,” said Natarajan. “The officials visited the houses twice and they could have been missed in case they were not at home,” said district collector S Sivarasu adding that the process was completed on March 16. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/many-not-keen-on-postal-ballot/articleshow/81595047.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: As turnout dwindles, private hospitals told to vaccinate 1k each a day||MUMBAI: Civic chief I S Chahal on Friday directed private hospitals to ramp up their vaccination drive by inoculating 1,000 people each in a day through extended immunisation hours (9am to 9pm). He said Mumbai must hit the target of 1 lakh vaccinations daily so that 45 lakh vaccine doses are administered in as many days to the 22 lakh-23 lakh people from priority groups. Public hospitals currently carry out 80% of vaccinations. Chahal’s diktat came in a week that has seen turnout dwindle with the initial euphoria wearing off. Since the drive was opened for senior citizens and people above 45 years on March 1, daily vaccinations had seen a steady growth till Monday when numbers began to drop— they fell 12% by Thursday (39,644) as against Monday (44,683). On Friday, numbers rose marginally to 42,740. The decline in footfall of senior citizens continued though. From 30,298 senior citizens who took the vaccine on Monday, they dropped to 21,422 on Friday. Vaccination numbers plunged in the state as well to 2 lakh on Thursday from 2.74 lakh on Wednesday. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said the initial two weeks saw a good response from middle- and upper-class citizens. “The drive has to be taken to the slums now. From Monday, there will be registration booths in Dharavi,” he said. Private hospitals have been asked to reach out to housing societies near them using their own resources or through corporators and social organisations. A civic official, though, admitted to concerns about vaccine stocks and said the city currently has stocks to last 3-4 days. Chahal said civic hospitals were shouldering the lion’s share of vaccinations and private hospitals were vaccinating merely 4,000 people on some days. On Friday, for instance, the 25 BMC centres immunised 27,440, more than double of 12,592 by 59 private hospitals. “Vaccination is crucial to bring down the overall mortality rate to zero and to reduce the severity of the infection,” Chahal said. He rooted for 24/7 vaccination centres once again, saying given the lifestyle and office hours in Mumbai, more people can get vaccinated if the timings were from 9 am to 9 pm. Private hospitals said they are willing to scale up if the turnout increases. Joy Chakraborty, COO of Hinduja Hospital, said most private hospitals vaccinate an average of 300 people daily. “We have to either work 24/7 to cover 1,000 people or add booths. We are exploring both options,” he said. Dr Gautam Bhansali from Bombay Hospital said the footfall was not high in private hospitals. Kakani said, “Public hospitals will not vaccinate on Sunday but private centres are free to operate. We will need faster replenishment if vaccination picks up. We hope to receive fresh stocks on Monday.” The city has vaccinated 8.1 lakh so far, including a lakh with both doses. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, in Nandurbar to review the vaccination drive, said the state will ensure enough stocks are available so the drive continues without disruption.

---||Nagpur||Increasing Covid admissions strain vaccination drive at pvt hospitals||Nagpur: Some of the 74 private inoculation centres are now under immense pressure as they are also Dedicated Covid Hospitals (DCHs), where the rush has suddenly increased due to surge in daily cases. The spike in DCH admissions has directly impacted the daily vaccination drive at these hospitals. Some centres are also facing problem of manpower as their staffers too have tested positive. The vaccination staff at some centres is busy juggling different hats in the same shift, taking care of registration of patients, lining them up and fielding Covid admission queries too. Yet, some private hospitals have worked out plans to deal with the challenge and smoothly run both Covid treatment and vaccination. Kunal Hospital director Dr Shishir Shrivastav said they have decided to admit only Covid patients till such time as the cases decline. “Vaccine beneficiaries are constantly coming. We are vaccinating 200 persons a day. Many of our staff have got infected with Covid for the first time. We are finding it difficult, but need to manage it as we are fighting a war. It is an emergency situation and we can’t stop treatment or vaccination. We are trying our best,” he said. Dr Hema Dhoble, head of Covid unit at Suretech Hospital, said they have distributed both the activities to different campuses. “Our city hospital is now only for Covid patients while the Jamtha facility is for vaccination. We are able to do it smoothly because we have enough space on the outskirts,” she said. Dr Sadashiv Bhole, one of the directors of Seven Star Hospital, said both the tasks are manageable in a large set up like theirs. “We have isolated two areas — Covid and non-Covid. Vaccination in done in non-Covid area. It is being done very smoothly,” he said. Sushrut Hospital director Dr Sushrut Babhulkar too said that large hospitals have different entry and exit points and requisite infrastructure, so they don’t face problems. “We are doing it quite smoothly,” he said. Dr Aziz Khan, whose Crescent Hospital and Heart Centre too is a vaccination centre, said the vaccine is the only weapon against the pandemic and everyone needs to be inoculated at the earliest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/increasing-covid-admissions-strain-vaccination-drive-at-pvt-hospitals/articleshow/81593870.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Mumbai||Household savings halved to 10.4% of GDP in Q2: RBI||Mumbai: Preliminary estimates show a substantial waning of the household financial savings rate to 10.4% of GDP in the second quarter of 2020-21 from a high 21% in the preceding quarter, as households switched from an “essentials only” spending to discretionary with the gradual reopening and unlocking of the economy, a Reserve Bank of India (RBI) report showed on Friday. However, the report also asserted optimism is taking hold among households, businesses, investors and markets. India is likely to decouple from other emerging economies that face rising financing costs and a debt pile-up. “Households’ financial savings rate might have fallen further in Q3:2020-21 with the intensification of consumption and economic activity,” the report said. The state of the economy report said that there is an urgency to resume high growth, and incoming data point to even contact-intensive services, such as personal care, recreation and hospitality gathering traction and pace. This, even as agriculture crosses production highs in various crops and in horticulture, and manufacturing stops contracting. It said the COVID-19-induced spike in household financial savings rate in the first quarter of 2020-21 waned substantially in the second quarter in a counter-seasonal manner. While households’ deposits and borrowings picked up, their holdings of currency and savings in mutual funds moderated. Increased household consumption, particularly its discretionary component, could be attributed to resumption in economic activity following the easing of lockdown, it said. “Going forward, optimism on account of mass vaccination is expected to further boost consumption demand and work further towards restoration of the pre-pandemic spending and saving pattern,” the report said. The report also warned that central banks will go beyond their conciliatory “open mouth operations” if their stated stances are challenged. This is in the context of bond investors globally shunning auctions on expectations that yields will rise. “Globally, policies will seek to stimulate, but markets will stare at tea leaves and ghosts of tightening of the past — neither growth nor inflation hard data support market movements so far,” the report said. It said India is poised on the cusp of two tipping points. “First, there are ominous signs that infections are rising. A second wave? Time will tell. On the other hand, vaccinations have moved beyond health workers to senior citizens, but at 3.3 crore as on March 16, the entire process needs to be speeded up,” the report said. Going forward, the vaccination drive and flattening of the infections curve will help improve consumer sentiment, boost business spirits and make the digital payments industry the key driver of the post-Covid revival agenda as it ushers in a transformation in “how we work, learn, shop, pay and live”. The report also said India is likely to decouple from other emerging markets despite debt service accounting for 25% of Budget revenues. According to the report, India is different because the average maturity of government debt is 11 years, which reduces refinancing risks. Another advantage is that most of the public debt is held in India and is less vulnerable to capital outflows. “Also, India has growth credibility — the average rate of interest on public debt is less than the growth rate of the economy,” it said. The report pointed out that, even as countries rush to vaccinate and struggle with resurgent and mutant strains, the lingering effects of the slowdown of global economic activity in Q4:2020 are beginning to fade. “It is more likely now than before that the global economy will regain lost momentum in Q2,” it added. In 2021, domestic inflation will likely ease after June, but it will be higher than in prints because of statistical base effects of high inflation a year ago, it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/household-savings-halved-to-10-4-of-gdp-in-q2-rbi/articleshow/81596711.cms||---
---||Mumbai||In 3 months, vaccination likely for all over 50, says Randeep Guleria||The second phase of the nationwide vaccination drive against Covid-19 could be expanded within the next three months to include people aged 50 and above, national Covid task force member and AIIMS Delhi director Dr Randeep Guleria told TOI on Friday. Union health minister Harsh Vardhan, too, told the Lok Sabha on Friday that groups being inoculated will be expanded in the coming days because the infection, and the scientific community’s response to it, is dynamic. In 3 months, all over 50 likely to get jabs: GuleriaCurrently, the second phase of the drive, which started on March 1, includes people who are 60 years and above besides those who are 45 and above with comorbidities. Dr Guleria said that within 6-8 weeks there is hope that two more vaccines, Sputnik V and the one manufactured by Zydus Cadila, will get emergency authorisation as they have the required data. “If more vaccine players are there in the market, it will ease pressure off the existing companies and more age groups can be brought into the drive according to the demand and supply,” he said, adding that the two existing firms, Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech, which produce Covishield and Covaxin, respectively, have been told to ramp up production. He said vaccines could be introduced in the open market only after the priority group. “Unless the priority population is addressed and we have enough doses it is unlikely that you will see Covid-19 vaccines in the local chemist shops anytime soon.” Vardhan said universal immunisation is not needed against Covid and that the government is following the recommendations of the national expert group on vaccine administration for Covid-19 and WHO norms on the matter. The minister said it is “not necessary scientifically to give each and every person in India the vaccine”. In a written response to several MPs, the health ministry said the government is planning to ramp up the pace of vaccination. On the demand for mass vaccination, Dr Guleria said this will not help as there will be a possibility of a spike in Covid-19 cases in the adjacent areas in the absence of restrictions on interstate travel. Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and Supriya Sule have demanded mass vaccination of those above 18 years of age in the state. “If we carry out region-wise vaccination we’ll only be chasing the virus rather than have a comprehensive plan to break the chain of transmission and decrease mortality,” Dr Guleria said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtrain-3-months-vax-likely-for-all-over-50-task-force-member/articleshow/81595062.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The owner has been identified as Rajkumar, and the brokers as Ganga Poojari from Odisha and Mugundar from Bihar. They were booked on charges of procuring and employing a 16-year-old boy from Bihar, a 16-year-old boy from Odisha and two 15-year-old boys from Odisha in the construction site. The case was registered following continuous efforts by the Bachpan Bachao Andolan (BBA). The trio were booked under Bonded Labour System Abolition Act, Child and Adolescent Labourer (prohibition and regulation) Act, Juvenile Justice Act and IPC. They are yet to be arrested. The boys were rescued from the construction site of Trichy Corporation on February 15. Preliminary inquiry revealed the families of the Odisha boys were paid Rs 2,000 each while the family of the boy from Bihar was paid Rs 5,000. The boys were forced to work for 10 hours per day. The complaint was filed by the village administrative officer (VAO) PV Rajesh Kumar. It may be recalled that the revenue divisional officer (RDO) also issued the release certificates to the boys only on March 3 after a long deliberation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/child-labour-case-against-construction-firm-owner-broker/articleshow/81595063.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: AIIMS set to start virtual autopsy, no cuts needed||NEW DELHI: For a family that has lost someone to unnatural death, be it suicide or accident, the grief is compounded when they have to witness the dissected and sutured body after the autopsy. Postmortem examination is an integral part of medicine, which involves dissecting the body from top to bottom. To avoid this, All India Institute of Medical Sciences has decided to conduct virtual autopsy, wherever possible. The facility would be inaugurated by Dr Balram Bhargava, director general of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), on Saturday. Virtual autopsy, as the term suggests, involves examining the internal organs, tissues and bones without touching the body. Under this process, the body is packed in a bag and put in a CT scan machine. Within seconds, thousands of images of the internal organs are captured, which can be analysed by forensic experts. Dr Sudhir Gupta, professor and head of forensic medicine department at AIIMS, said they would be the first medical institution in south and southeast Asia to have this facility. Developed countries like Switzerland, the US and the UK have already adopted imaging technology to conduct autopsy in select cases. AIIMS gets close to 3,000 cases for postmortem examination every year. Dr Gupta said 30% to 50% of these cases do not require dissection. “These include deaths caused due to accident, hanging or suicide. In many cases, there is no need to cut open the body to establish the cause of death. A virtual autopsy will suffice,” he added. In police investigation, autopsy is an important part in case of an unnatural death. It takes anywhere between 30 minutes and three days, depending on the complexity of the case and availability of experts to conduct the procedure. However, virtual autopsy can be conducted within minutes. “This will save us time and manpower both,” said Dr Abhishek Yadav, associate professor of forensic medicine at AIIMS. In 2019, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan had, while describing the initiative by AIIMS and ICMR to set up a virtual autopsy lab, expressed the government’s interest in developing multiple centres of this kind across the country to uphold the concept of dignified management of the dead. In a virtual autopsy, the deceased’s records are available in digital format, which permits additional analysis by other forensic pathologists and second or third opinion even after years if some allegations crop up in the future. Gaurang Kanth, a Supreme Court advocate, said, “The use of imaging technology will reduce the risk of human error in evidence collection in medico-legal cases. It will also aid in court proceedings.” AIIMS was also among the first institutions in the country to set up a digital X-ray machine in the forensic unit in 2016. It is utilised in cases of firearm deaths, blast injuries, penetrating injuries and hidden fractures among others. “Generally, the casualty is crowded with patients, doctors and staff. It is embarrassing and inhuman to do the x-ray of the body in the place where live patients are being subjected for radiological examination. Especially when the body is decomposed, it contaminates the whole atmosphere and the place, thus increasing the risk of infection spread,” said a senior doctor. In 2012, he added, when the bullet ridden body of liquor baron Ponty Chadha was brought to the institute, it had to be transported all the way to casualty for X-ray.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aiims-set-to-start-virtual-autopsy-no-cuts-needed/articleshow/81595090.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha
---||Mumbai||Blood donation not allowed for 2 months after 1st vaccine shot||MUMBAI: Those who take the Covid-19 vaccine cannot donate blood for nearly two months. The National Blood Transfusion Council (NBTC) has recently released guidelines stating that one cannot donate blood from the day of taking the first dose of the vaccine till 28 days after the second dose. Since there is a minimum gap of 28 days between the two doses, the period one cannot donate blood stretches up to a minimum of 57 days. The NBTC issued a notification on March 5, stating, “28 days post vaccination deferral after the last dose of Covid-19 vaccination, irrespective of the type of vaccine received”. Dr Sunil Gupta, director of NBTC, told TOI a technical research group has taken the decision based on recommendations concerning blood donation and vaccination. “The group has studied the donation gap that exists after one is vaccinated with an inactivated as well as live attenuated virus and thought 28 days was a safe window,” he said, adding while none of the vaccines given in the country are live, the 28-day gap was decided since there have been reports of fever and body pain, among other post-vaccination effects. Covaxin is an inactivated vaccine that contains the killed virus while Covishield is a recombinant vaccine that has a small piece of the virus DNA. A senior blood transfusion expert questioned the deferral period, saying if none were live vaccines, why stop people from donating blood.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaiblood-donation-not-allowed-for-2-mths-after-1st-vax-shot/articleshow/81593881.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Distant Covid funerals are back as deaths spike again||NAGPUR: Damp weather only added to the gloom in the air. Men wearing white protective overalls and masks pulling out a body indicated they have brought another Covid victim. The corpse, wrapped in a black plastic sheet, is put on a pyre, as mourning relatives watch from a distance. “Please don’t stand close to each other,” shouts one of them as the pyre lights up. It’s the scene in almost every crematorium or burial ground in the city. Another spike in Covid infections has brought back scenes of death like these. At Mokshadham, four pyres had Covid victims burning at a time. Deaths due to Covid are registered separately, based on the hospital papers. For the rest, relatives have to just mention the illness. A death certificate specifying details is not a must, said officials at crematoria. For Covid victims, those handling the body are from NMC’s health department, now working as Covid undertakers. “After a patient dies, the team in concerned zonal office is assigned the job,” said Ragesh Rangari at Mokshadham. By afternoon, they had cremated four bodies and were heading to bring the fifth. “There was some respite after January, but it has started again, we keep getting calls till evening,” said Rangari. Each day 7 to 8 bodies are coming here, said a staffer at Mokshadham. Almost every pyre was burning at the Gangabhai ghat, little over 3km away. Another inconsolable family followed by the NMC team. “Till Friday afternoon, eight of the 10 bodies were of Covid victims here. On Thursday, there were 16 bodies out of 23 in all,” said an official at the office. The numbers have gone up since last a or 10 days, he says flipping the register’s pages. On March 17, there were 10, he adds. They are of all ages, from 91 to 80, 31, 55 and even 22 years, said the official. “Include one more from our side,” said a youth standing beside him. He had come for his 25-year-old cousin’s last rites. The 25-year-old was complaining of stomach ache and breathlessness since a week. She was brought to Mayo Hospital at Nagpur only a couple of days ago, where she died, said her kin. She was detected Covid positive during treatment. At the burial grounds, organizations like Jamiat-e-Ulema-Hind are in action again. “In last 15 days, we have performed last rites of around 40 persons,” said Maulana Hazif Masood Ahmed from the Nagpur unit of JUH. “On Monday, we did five more which included a Christian.

Selfies and videos have been posted by passengers on social media, which have gone viral, increasing the demand for the auto driver. The city has been registering 37C at noon for the last one week. Unable to manage the heat, R Rathinavel, an auto driver hailing from Sangiliyandapuram installed coconut thatches last week. The coconut thatches acts as an insulator preventing the heat from the cieling enter the passenger cabin, making it comparatively cooler than other autos. “Before picking up a passenger, I will sprinkle water over the coconut thatches. Several passengers collected my mobile number and have became a regular customer,” Rathinavel said. The autorickshaw driver said he had picked up the coconut leaves from his house and thatched them on his own without any external expense. Rathinavel’s innovation has also motivated his fellow autorickshaw drivers in Sangiliyandapuram to install the same arrangement in their vehicles to overcome the sultry weather. “A few customers who enjoyed a cool ride shall hand over some additional money above the metered transport charge,” Rathinavel added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/auto-driver-uses-coconut-thatch-to-beat-heat-earns-customers-praise/articleshow/81595087.cms||---

---||Noida||Four of family die after truck hits car on Yamuna Expressway||GREATER NOIDA: Four of a family died after their car was hit by a mini truck on Yamuna Expressway around Friday noon, the police said. The accident happened when the tyre of a truck — Tata 407 — burst and it jumped the divider of the Noida-Agra carriageway, landing on the other side and hitting the car which was going towards Delhi. Cops said the accident could have been averted had crash barriers been installed along the central verge of the e-way. “When the truck reached the other carriageway, it hit Brezza, causing injuries to the five passengers travelling in the car,” said Rabupura SHO Dinesh Yadav. Soon after the accident, the injured were rushed to Kailash Hospital in Greater Noida, where 42-year-old Nitin Sharma, his wife Urvashi Sharma, aunt Ruchi Sharma and 13-year-old son Shubh Sharma died during the treatment. Nitin’s friend Satish Chaudhary (42), who was in the front passenger seat at the time of the accident, is in ICU, a police officer said. The mini truck was travelling towards Aligarh after collecting a consignment of vegetables from the Okhla mandi. The driver fled the spot soon after the accident. Nitin, a scrap dealer from Mathura’s Satghara colony, was travelling to Delhi for his wife’s treatment in Sir Ganga Ram Hospital. “There is no CCTV camera near the accident spot. The truck owner has been identified as Keshav from Aligarh’s Ghonda. An FIR will be lodged,” he said. Nitin’s father Shail Bihari Sharma is grief-stricken and was unavailable for comment. Earlier, seven people from Haryana’s Jind, who were going to visit a religious place in Mathura, were killed when a truck overturned after its tyre burst and rammed their car. This accident could also have been averted had crash barriers been installed on the expressway. Following this, the Yamuna Authority officials had lodged an FIR at Beta II police station against the interim resolution professional (IRP) and the interim monitoring committee comprising Jaypee Infratech and bank representatives tasked with the management of the expressway’s daily affairs, for negligence in failing to implement the security measures on the expressway as suggested by the IIT-Delhi in May 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/four-of-family-die-after-truck-hits-car-on-yamuna-expressway/articleshow/81595124.cms||Shikha Salaria
---||Nagpur||Prisoner’s release on Covid parole not his right: HC||NAGPUR: While remanding back a prisoner’s case for availing Covid-19 parole to Central Jail superintendent (SP) here, the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court has ruled that it can’t be ‘by right’. A division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Avinash Gharote directed the SP to regularly monitor the pandemic inside prisons and take a decision to release inmates on Covid-19 parole depending on the situation. Quoting Rule 19 (1) of the Maharashtra Prisons (Mumbai Furlough and Parole) Rules, 1959, the bench clarified that the granting parole in such conditions isn’t mandatory, but it’s an enabling provision. “It confers discretion on SP to consider applications depending on various factors. He may necessitate the inmates’ release, enabling decongestion of the prisons, in order to arrest the spread of the Covid-19 virus. It can’t be said that a claim to be released on Covid-19 parole is a right vested in the prisoner,” the judges said. Petitioner Ayyaz Khan had moved HC challenging SP’s decision to reject his parole on grounds of Covid-19 pandemic on October 19 last year. He had applied as per new rules framed by the Maharashtra government on May 8 last year for decongesting the prisons for avoiding spread of deadly virus by amending Rule 19 (1). While asking the SP to determine whether the inmates could be kept in isolation and social distancing norms can be safely followed, the judges further directed him to decide whether there is a requirement of decongestion and the number of prisoners which would be required to be released to avoid spread of the virus. “The SP should mark the category of prisoners who can be released, depending upon the Covid-19 situation in the locality, to which such released prisoners are expected to go. We’re constrained to make the above observations, for the reason that an impression has been created that a release on Covid-19 parole, is a matter of right, which it is not,” the HC added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/prisoners-release-on-covid-parole-not-his-right-hc/articleshow/81593922.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Although the budget was tabled before the model code of conduct, officials are shying away from even disclosing the budget on the official website of the civic body citing restrictions. “Since the budget was tabled before the election announcement, nothing stops them from disclosing the details. The transparency of Trichy corporation comes under question as delay in disclosing the document seems intentional,” said RTI activist SP Thiyagarajan. The corporation’s website also lacks the annual audit report on smart cities mission fund for 2019-20. The report will have expenses under the initiative and funds received from the union government. While no new announcements were made in the budget, the delay in making the budget copy public was criticised by locals. “We were told by higher officials not to disclose the budget as the model code of conduct is in effect.

The preliminary study near Maaligaimedu has identified iron nails and earthen tiles believed to be that from the Chola dynasty. The department has dug eight pits each measuring 100sqft area. “We have dug for 30cm depth, we will go deep further to 1.5m. In the past three weeks of excavation, we have identified around 15 iron nails and broken tiles. The discovery indicates a better scope for our excavation,” an official with the department said. The remains identified might belong to a palace, he added. The department engaged the local workforce after training them to excavate the surface with utmost care with seven officials overseeing the progress. In the next stage, the officials are planning to probe the Ayudhakalam village, which archaeologists believe that it could have had a workshop for manufacturing weapons. Since Gangaikonda Cholapuram was the capital of Cholas for over two centuries, key findings are anticipated by the authorities in the ongoing study covering 18sqkm around the erstwhile capital of Cholas. The ongoing study will continue in multiple phases, while the present one is expected to go on till June 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/iron-nails-earthen-tiles-found-at-ariyalur-site/articleshow/81595121.cms||---

---||Bhopal||CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan orders Sunday lockdown in Bhopal, Indore & Jabalpur||BHOPAL: Hit by a surge in Covid infections, the Madhya Pradesh government on Friday announced Sunday lockdown in Bhopal, Indore and Jabalpur and ordered all schools and colleges to be shut till March 31. It’s exactly a year since the first Covid-19 case was detected in Madhya Pradesh — Jabalpur, in fact. These three cities are the worst hit by the spike in Covid cases, accounting for nearly 60% of Friday’s count of 1,140. They also have 58% of the state’s active cases. At a Coronavirus review meeting on Friday, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said lockdown will come into effect in Indore, Bhopal and Jabalpur at 10pm on Saturday and will continue till 6am on Monday. Essential services and industries are exempted. The CM once again fervently appealed to people to wear masks, maintain social distancing, avoid crowds and help the administration in controlling the pandemic. “Those who are not wearing masks are not only putting their lives at risk but also those of their family members and others,” Chouhan said, adding: “The state government is doing everything to end the menace but cooperation of people is a must”. Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC) on Friday sealed 13 commercial establishments because staff or customers were not wearing masks and violating social distancing, said IMC s additional commissioner Devendra Singh. Collector Manish Singh said more than 2,600 people — including 28 IMC employees — were fined in the last 24 hours for not wearing facemask. An order signed by ACS (home) Rajesh Rajora said that transportation of essential goods and raw and finished products, industrial workers, and candidates appearing in exams would be exempted from the lockdown. Schools and colleges will remain closed in Bhopal, Indore & Jabalpur till March 31 but exams will be conducted on schedule. Earlier, they were scheduled to open on April 1. Markets will close at 10pm in Ujjain, Ratlam, Chhindwara, Burhanpur, Betul and Khargone in addition to Bhopal, Indore, Jabalpur and Gwalior. The district administration’s permission would be required to organise any programme during the Sunday lockdowns. A day earlier, the CM had said that the state should be ready to face tough measures ahead. “Coronavirus is spreading its tentacles in the state again and it will have to be contained without hampering economic activities,” he said. Buses from Maharashtra will be barred from entering MP from March 21. ACS (health) Mohd. Suleman said that 21,000 Coronavirus tests were carried out on Thursday and the positivity rate was 5.5%, which is high.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/shivraj-orders-sunday-lockdown-in-bhopal-indore-jabalpur/articleshow/81593942.cms||---
---||Kochi||CB registers case against ED for coercion, conspiracy||Thiruvananthapuram: The crime branch has registered a case against Enforcement Directorate (ED) officers who are probing the gold smuggling case on the basis of the statements of two woman civil police officers. The crime branch has charged the case under sections 116, 120-B, 167, 192, 193 and 195-A of the IPC for conspiracy, intimidation and forcing to give false statements against the chief minister. The FIR has been submitted in the judicial magistrate court in Kochi on Friday. The crime branch had earlier conducted a preliminary inquiry, in which statements of 18 persons, including that of Swapna Suresh, the key accused in the gold smuggling case, was recorded. It is reliably learnt that a special team will be set up for probing the case. The state had received legal advice from the director general of prosecutions that a case should be registered against ED sleuths who had interrogated Suresh in jail. The government had sought legal advice based on the report of the investigation team that had probed the leak of Suresh’s voice clip. Woman civil police officers Siji Vijayan of Palarivattom police station and S Rejimol of Kadavanthra police station, who were allegedly on duty while the ED sleuths interrogated Suresh, had stated before the probe team that the ED officers were compelling Swapna to give a statement against the chief minister. Vijayan had further said that the ED officers were asking questions to Suresh in Hindi and English, and since she understood both the languages, she could make out what they were asking. Earlier, a voice clip allegedly of Suresh had circulated that had become controversial. In the voice clip, Suresh was heard saying that the ED sleuths offered to turn her an approver if she gave a statement against the chief minister in connection with the gold smuggling case. She had also said that the ED officers had not allowed her to go through her statements properly before signing it. While Suresh confirmed that it was her voice in the clip, she said that she had no clue as to who recorded it as she had spoken to several people. After an investigation by jail officials, DIG (prisons) had said that the voice clip was not recorded from the jail. Meanwhile, it is reliably learnt that the ED which is suspecting foul play in the developments, would seek an inquiry by a central agency against the police officers who have deposed against the ED sleuths.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cb-registers-case-against-ed-for-coercion-conspiracy/articleshow/81593946.cms||---

A key member of the Manram and part of the disciplinary committee, Parameswaran wants to work for the upliftment of farmers and weavers in his region and for making Karur a textile hub. Had Rajnikanth gone ahead with his political aspirations, Bhagavan Parameswaran would have played a key role in the party. A home textile businessman from Karur, Parameswaran has always remained low profile when it comes to fan club activities by providing outside support. He was noticed by his onscreen icon who was quick to give him a key position when he started Rajni Makkal Manram. Parameswaran hit the limelight when he brought a group of priests from Palani and conducted a grand prayer for the well-being of actor Rajnikanth in 2011. The actor was hospitalised in Singapore for kidney related ailments. He is known for erecting giant banners across the town whenever a movie of the superstar releases. Parameswaran is now contesting from the Karur assembly segment as an independent after Rajnikanth shelved the idea of entering politics over ill-health. “I will not use the name of my icon or the manram during my campaign, but my identity as his fan would certainly increase my winning prospects,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/rajini-manram-member-to-contest-as-independent/articleshow/81595129.cms||---
---||Delhi||Can automated parking help find a solution to Nizamuddin puzzle?||NEW DELHI: An automated puzzle parking in Nizamuddin may come to the rescue of both locals and visitors to the 13th century Sufi shrine who often face major traffic bottlenecks near Lajpat Rai Marg and Lodhi Colony. Construction work was initiated on Friday. This will be the third multilevel puzzle parking project by South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC), said an official. Two automated towers, each 14.5m high, will have six levels and a vehicle retrieval time of around 150 seconds. Together, they will accommodate 86 cars. The project is likely to cost Rs 15.8 crore. Some road design changes are also being considered to decongest the arterial road. Nizamuddin, which houses several important tourist sites such as Humayun’s Tomb, Sunder Nursery and the dargah, is also densely populated and remains so severely congested that the matter has also been taken up by courts. In 2018, the Supreme Court had pulled up Delhi Police over congestion in the area. In April 2019, Delhi High Court had ordered to remove traffic congestion and encroachments on a key arterial link on Mathura Road near Neela Gumbad. The roundabout bridges south Delhi to the central zone of the capital with heavy traffic movement along Mathura Road and Lodhi Road. But the area still continues to be in a bad shape even during weekends when queued-up traffic towards Sunder Nursery and Humanyu’s Tomb spills over till the Sabz Burj roundabout. Multiple streams of traffic flows criss-crossing unsupervised and encroachment compound the problem. The situation is especially chaotic at the point where the traffic towards the Barapullah ramp and vehicles towards Moolchand cross each other. The virtual ceremony was presided over by the Union minister of state for heath, Ashwini Kumar Choubey, while mayor Anamika and Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta were also present. Gupta claimed that despite facing financial crunch, SDMC had taken steps to enhance services. “The automated facility will ease parking menace in the area. Recently, it has inaugurated two fully automated multilevel car parkings in Green Park and Lajpat Nagar,” he added. Anamika said there would be no manual interference in this parking lot. A 1.5-lakh-litre water tank has been constructed in the basement, she added. Commissioner Gyanesh Bharti said an MoU had been inked with National Thermal Power Corporation to set up solar panels and e-charging stations. Referring to the rising Covid cases, Choubey said the health ministry would ensure uninterrupted supply of vaccines to Delhi. Paying condolences to deceased Covid-19 warriors of SDMC, he said “if Delhi Government moves any proposal for bereaved families, the Centre will surely look into it”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/can-automated-parking-help-find-a-solution-to-nizamuddin-puzzle/articleshow/81595174.cms||---

Union health minister Harsh Vardhan, too, told the Lok Sabha on Friday that groups being inoculated will be expanded in the coming days because the infection, as well as the scientific community’s response to it, is dynamic. Currently, the second phase of the drive, which started on March 1, includes people who are 60 years and above besides those who are 45 and above with comorbidities. Dr Guleria said that within 6-8 weeks there is hope that two more vaccines, Sputnik V and the one manufactured by Zydus Cadila, will get emergency authorisation as they have the required data. “If more vaccine players are there in the market, it will ease pressure off the existing companies and more age groups can be brought into the drive according to the demand and supply,” he said, adding that the two existing firms, Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech, which produce Covishield and Covaxin, respectively, have been asked to ramp up their production. Read AlsoMass vax in one region won’t curb spread: GuleriaPune: National Covid-19 task force member and director of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Dr Randeep Guleria said mass vaccination in the most-affected states would not be of help much because of the possibility of a spike in cases in the adjacent areas in the absence of restrictionsHe added that vaccines could be introduced in the open market only after the priority group. Vardhan said that universal immunisation is not required against Covid and that the government is following the recommendations of the national expert group on vaccine administration for Covid-19 and WHO guidelines on the matter. The minister added that it is “not necessary scientifically to give each and every person in the country the vaccine”. In a written response to several MPs, the health ministry also said the government is planning to ramp up the pace of vaccination through an increase in the number of vaccination centres in both government and private health facilities. On the demand for mass vaccination in the most-affected states, Dr Guleria said that this will not help as there will be a possibility of a spike in Covid-19 cases in the adjacent areas in the absence of restrictions on inter-state travel. Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and Supriya Sule have demanded mass vaccination of those above 18 years of age in the state. “A holistic solution has to be adopted and if we carry out region-wise vaccination we’ll only be chasing the virus rather than have a comprehensive plan to break the chain of transmission and decrease mortality,” Dr Guleria said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/vaccine-drive-to-be-widened-jab-for-50-in-3-months-aiims-delhi-director-dr-randeep-guleria/articleshow/81597695.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Ranchi||Will suggest Supreme Court to raise job reservation cap above 50%, says Chief minister Hemant Soren||RANCHI: Chief minister Hemant Soren on Friday said his government will write to the Supreme Court and suggest raising the 50% reservation cap on jobs. Earlier this month, the apex court had invited suggestions from the states on whether the 50% ceiling should be increased as done by states like Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. “Taking cognisance of the 50% reservation cap on jobs, the Supreme Court (SC) had recently sought suggestions from states on whether job reservation limits should be raised above 50%. We have decided to provide 75% job reservations to the locals. We will write to the SC and suggest raising the limit above 50%,” Hemant said at the Jharkhand Assembly. Hemant’s remarks came after Poriyahat MLA Pradeep Yadav suggested that the Jharkhand government should consider imposing 75% reservation in jobs from the 50% quota left for non-locals. Responding to another suggestion from JMM MLA Stephen Marandi, the CM said that his government is considering providing waivers in power bills to the state’s residents. Meanwhile, the CM on Friday unleashed a barrage of criticisms against the previous Raghubar Das-led government. Hemant accused the erstwhile government of indulging in widespread corruption. “They closed down thousands of schools claiming that it’ll help the state exchequer in saving Rs 15,000 crore. Where did the money go,” he said. Terming the urban development minister, C P Singh, as a rabble rouser, Hemant said, “The urban development department mutilated the Morhabadi Ground in a bid to convert it into Times Square. They built underground car parking zones at a cost of Rs 40 crore but only 60 vehicles could be accommodated there.” He added that though Jharkhand had the potential to become the top producer of lac and cocoon, the state’s production languished at 50% of its capacity. He further said that his government will accord agriculture status to the two goods and provide minimum support price.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/will-suggest-sc-to-raise-job-reservation-cap-above-50-says-hemant/articleshow/81593405.cms||---

Principal district and sessions judge Arun Kumar Rai granted bail to Mishra based on a petition filed by the officer-in-charge of Lohsinghna police station, Nisha Kumari, on March 6. Mishra was released on Thursday evening. In her petition, Kumari said Mishra was arrested under provisions of the Narcotic Drug and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985, by Hazaribag sadar police after receiving a tip-off that he was carrying brown sugar and opium in his two-wheeler. Later, five persons, identified as Anand Kumar (49), Md Ezaz Ashraf alias Bablu (40), Sarfaraz Alam alias Guddu (42), Bunty alias Miraj Hussain (23) and Aditya Soni (38), were arrested for implicating him, Kumari said. According to the case, Mishra was arrested on March 3 after finding brown sugar, opium and Rs 1.23 lakh in cash in his two-wheeler parked at the Old Collectorate based on the the tip-off. The activist was produced and sent to judicial custody on the same day and his vehicle was seized. However, during their investigation on March 5, police found that Mishra was framed to take revenge. SP Kartik S said, "On March 3, Mishra went to the Old Collectorate building and after parking his bike, he went inside to collect information about the irregularities in the sub-registrar office. Some of the accused invited Mishra for tea at a stall. While he was at the stall, the other accused broke open his vehicle's luggage box and kept the banned substances and the money. They then informed the police." Police then filed a petition to the court on March 6. The court, however, did not pass any order but sought more details. Police filed the details sought on March 17. In its ruling, the court said, "After examining the petition of police and the one filed by Mishra, it was found that Mishra was implicated in the case as part of a conspiracy by the accused."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/hbag-rti-activist-granted-bail-after-cops-say-he-was-framed/articleshow/81593427.cms||---

It took firemen nearly six hours and seven tankers to douse the blaze. A major part of the plant suffered extensive damage due to the explosion and fire. The company manufactures pharma intermediates and specialty chemicals. It also provides solutions for contract manufacturing involving reactions like hydrochlorination. Firemen are trying to ascertain the cause of the fire in the plant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/4-workers-injured-in-petrochem-unit-fire/articleshow/81594550.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

On the occasion of World Sparrow Day which is being celebrated every year on March 20, city-based NGO, Nature Club Surat, aims to revisit their initiative ‘sparrow count’,which it began last year. “We have asked bird watchers, nature lovers and citizens alike to count the number of sparrows they find around them to get an estimate about the status of this eco-sensitive bird species. “The NGO aims to find out the places in the city where sparrows thrive and prepare a database that will help us to form strategies on how to conserve and raise their count,” said Snehal Patel, president, Nature Club Surat. “People will participate from their homes, share pictures of sparrows seen around their homes, gardens and societies on our WhatsApp number and email address besides sharing their observations too. This will help us map the sparrow population in the city,” she added. Last year's sparrow count exercise saw over 400 citizens joining from across the city who sent their feedback, photos and their observations on the bird. Sparrows were spotted in 54 sites in different parts of the the city which include Abhva, Athwalines, Althan, Adajan, Bamroli, Bharthana, Bhatar, Begampura, City light, Dindoli, Hazira, Katargam, Pal, Palanpur, Umara, Vesu and Varachha among other areas of the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/count-the-number-of-sparrows-around-you-surtis-urged/articleshow/81594664.cms||---

Lakra was shot at when he caught the two during an anti-snatching drive in Ranchi. The duo fired at him when they were unable to free themselves from his clutch and fled the spot. Ranchi SSP Surindra Jha said, “A special investigation team, headed by city SP Saurav, swung into action and raided a number of places to make the arrests.” Accused Imroz Ansari was nabbed in Ranchi while his accomplice Taukid Mallik was arrested in Hazaribag. Both of them are in their 20s and they hailed from the state capital. Police have seized a loaded country-made pistol, a country-made gun, several cartridges, a two-wheeler, a knife and two mobile phones from their possession. Meanwhile, state health minister Banna Gupta met the vicenarian sub-inspector at Medica hospital on Friday and provided monetary relief to him. “The bullet has fractured his leg but he is out of danger now,” city DSP Amit Singh said. On Thursday night, Ranchi Police had deputed some officers at several areas in a bid to check incidents of snatching. While moving around in Chutia area, Lakra spotted the two criminals on a scooty and tried to stop them at Mukchund crossing. As soon as Lakra caught hold of Imroz, Taukid tried attacking the officer and subsequently, took out a pistol and fired at him. The bullet hit Lakra on his right thigh while the two fled the spot on their two-wheeler. The accused were involved in over two dozen cases of chain-snatching in Ranchi and were recently in jail in connection with two cases each in Lohardaga and Gumla districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/2-arrested-for-firing-at-police-sub-inspector-in-ranchi/articleshow/81593451.cms||---

Kennedy travelled for 20 kms till Rajhara railway station and spoke to passengers of two coaches. “As many as 1,000 face masks were distributed among railway passengers during the drive,” Kennedy said. Talking to media persons after returning to Daltonganj, Kennedy said many passengers did not have face masks on. “Several passengers claimed wearing face masks would make it difficult for them to chew tobacco. They had their masks in their pockets. There was utter disregard for Covid-19 protocols on board the train,” Kennedy added. Railway sources said that lax attitude of a section of passengers at a time when the country is seemingly on the cusp of a second wave of infections was highly condemnable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/civil-surgeon-gives-masks-to-railway-passengers/articleshow/81593804.cms||---

Talking to TOI, state epidemiologist Dr Praveen Karn said, “We have been requested recently to arrange for RAT kits for the ongoing Army recruitment drive in Ranchi and some upcoming mass screening drives.” It may be noted that the government had discontinued Covid-19 screening through RAT since November 2020. Dr Karn said, “The government had not procured fresh stocks of RAT kits for a while since the infection rate had declined a bit. Moreover, as per the Centre’s guidelines, those testing negative through RAT had to undergo a fresh round of testing through RT-PCR. Keeping all these factors in mind, we had discontinued the use of antigen kits.” He added, “All this while, we were conducting Covid tests at RT-PCR labs and TrueNat testing centre in all districts. However, we have decided to go for RAT tests to strengthen our surveillance and the healthcare facilities have been asked to use them in case of an emergency so that patients, in need of urgent intervention, don’t suffer.” Meanwhile, the crackdown on violators of Covid-control measures continued in Ranchi on Friday and the cops issued notices to as many as 20 commercial establishments for not following safety norms. On Thursday, when the checking drive was launched by the district administration, challans worth over Rs 2 lakh were issued to over 400 persons for violating safety measures. “A total of 415 persons were penalised for moving around in the city without wearing masks,” a senior district official said. “The drive will continue in the wake of an expected rise in the number of Covid-19 cases,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jharkhand-to-resume-rat-screening-for-covid-cases/articleshow/81593785.cms||Gaurav Pandey
---||Ranchi||Rims conducts rare heart op for 1st time on 3-years-old||RANCHI: In a rare feat, doctors of the cardiology department of Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (Rims) conducted percutaneous device closure on a three-year-old child suffering from Patent Ductus Arteriosus, an opening between the two major blood vessels leading to the heart on Friday. A similar operation was also conducted on a 17-year-old girl and both the patients were provided treatment free of cost under the Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram (RBSK) scheme. Explaining the phenomenon, assistant professor of cardiology department Dr Prashant Kumar, who conducted the surgeries on Surbhi Kumari (3) and Khushboo Kumari (17) on Friday, said, the opening (ductus arteriosus) is a part of baby’s circulatory system in the womb which usually closes after birth. If it remains open, it becomes Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA). “I have been doing these interventions for long, but conducting a closure on a three-year-old is rare and has been done for the first time at Rims. The successful closure of PDA in in such cases is difficult as the organs of the body are relatively smaller in size and must be done with complete accuracy, because if left unattended, it leads to stunted growth and breathlessness and can be life threatening.” On being asked about the challenges, Prashant said, “The two cases were completely different as kids develop recurrent chest infections with this defect while those above 14 start experiencing breathlessness and the management has to be different for each kind. For patients less than five years of age, we have to be very cautious as these interventions are aimed at providing quality of life.” Dr Prashant also said the operations would not have been possible without the help from Dr Sanjay Kumar of the anaesthesia department and all faculty members of the cardiology department. On being asked why percutaneous device closure was preferred over open heart for the closure intervention, Dr Prashant said, “The parents of both the patients didn’t want an open heart surgery as it leaves a scar on their body.” Khushboo’s parents, who hail from Deoghar, said she was losing weight due to the complication. Surbhi’s parents on the other hand said they are grateful to the doctors of Rims. “I had visited Rims in December last year and after the doctor diagnosed my daughter with PDA, we had thought we would be going for medication. But Dr Prashant made us aware of the RSBK scheme and assured us that the treatment will be free of cost and he will take all necessary precautions. I am thankful to him for what he has done,” said Surbhi’s mother.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/rims-conducts-rare-heart-op-for-1st-time-on-3-yr-old/articleshow/81593818.cms||Gaurav Pandey

Health authorities remain concerned about a week-on-week increase in deaths, though this is lower than the rate at which new cases are being added every week. And while severity is more among the hospitalised cases with many requiring intensive care units (ICUs), the experience gained in managing such patients is helping reduce fatalities, officials said.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); Read AlsoHope amid crisis: Covid-19 cases surge but fatality rate stays lowNEW DELHI: The coronavirus cases in the country have been steadily rising since the last few weeks. However, the rise in cases has had little impact on the fatality rate. The recent surge in cases is being reported from several states, including Maharashtra and Punjab. Both the states have reported“Clinical experience gained through last several months has helped. Besides, the health ministry now has a detailed standard treatment protocol and hospitals are following it. This has helped keep deaths under control but the states with high caseload are also reporting larger number of deaths,” a senior official said.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); Officials are concerned that though deaths in proportion to new cases are low, health infrastructure may come under stress from rising cases and this may impact the toll. Average daily new cases are increasing at nearly 43% week-on-week, whereas new deaths are increasing 37% week-on-week, health ministry data till March 17 shows. While daily new cases started increasing from around February 21, the case fatality rate — denoting deaths over total number of cases — declined from 1.42% to 1.39% at present. In September, when cases were at a peak, case fatality rate was at around 1.75%. This declined to around 1.5% in October and further to around 1.45% in December. Even in Maharashtra and Punjab, which have witnessed a sharp increase in cases, the death rate has declined, though the two states are contributing the maximum to the death count from the infections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/despite-surge-in-new-covid-19-cases-fatality-rate-still-below-1-5/articleshow/81597629.cms||Sushmi Dey

He was speaking at the inauguration of the cadaver retrieval workshop organised at the premier healthcare institute by the State Organ Tissue Transplant Organisation (SOTTO) in collaboration with the Regional Organ Tissue Transplant Organization (ROTTO), Maharashtra, to train and educate surgeons in Goa. While a kidney transplant facility is offered at the Goa Medical College, Rane said liver transplants will also be made available. “A specialist required for transplants will be appointed so that the people of Goa do not have to travel out of the state for treatment,” the minister said. Goa Medical College dean Dr S M Bandekar said it has been a constant effort to set up a facility for liver transplant and donation in the state and that Friday’s workshop would focus on training and equipping retrieval teams with proper knowledge and guidance. The Goa Medical College’s transplant team of Dr Madumohan Prabhudessai, Dr J P Tiwari and Dr Shirley Desouza was felicitated by Regional Organ Tissue Transplant Organization and State Organ Tissue Transplant Organisation, Maharashtra. The workshop’s first session focused on the retrieval of liver, kidney, and bone from a cadaver that was placed in the forensic auditorium. It was live-streamed in the main auditorium where the delegates were seated, following which an active interaction took place. The second part of the workshop comprised a series of lectures delivered by experts in retrieval procedures, cannulation and preservation for transportation of organs. At least 100 delegates — including general and transplant surgeons (kidney and liver), orthopaedics, transplant coordinators, anaesthetists and nurses — from all over the state from the public and private sector participated in the event. State Organ Tissue Transplant Organisation Goa’s joint director Dr Preeti Varghese applauded the transplant team and other departments of the Goa Medical College that played a vital role in promoting the deceased donor transplant programme, ‘Nave Jivit’ (new life).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/one-floor-of-gmcs-superspecialty-block-for-organ-transplants-rane/articleshow/81595410.cms||Bindiya Chari

The National Blood Transfusion Council (NBTC) has recently released guidelines stating that one cannot donate blood from the day of taking the first dose of the vaccine till 28 days after the second dose. Since there is a minimum gap of 28 days between the two doses, the period one cannot donate blood stretches up to a minimum of 57 days. NBTC director Dr Sunil Gupta told TOI a technical research group has taken the decision based on existing recommendations. “The group has studied the donation gap that exists after one is vaccinated with an inactivated as well aslive attenuated virus and thought 28 days was a safe window.” He added while none of the vaccines currently given in India are live, the gap was decided since there have been reports of fever, bodypain, among other after-effects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/vaccine-recipients-cant-donate-blood-for-2-months/articleshow/81597782.cms||---

The Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA) has also said that, in the future, it will not grant any permission for the land in question. The shack operator was found to have constructed a swimming pool after taking permission to erect a shack. The violator was also found to have submitted to the GCZMA that he has demolished the swimming pool when the structure was still in existence. The GCZMA received a complaint in October last year about the illegal structures erected at Agonda. Accordingly, a showcause notice was issued to the violator and he was called for a personal hearing along with the complainant. At this personal hearing, the violator claimed before the GCZMA that, unlike the allegations made by the complainant, all the offending structures have already been removed. The GCZMA asked its expert members to carry out a site inspection, which was scheduled in February. The authority, upon investigations, found that the complainant and the violator had both used the GCZMA to settle a personal dispute. “The authority after hearing both the parties came to the conclusion that the present is a private dispute as both parties had entered into an agreement for common use of land for erection of temporary huts/shacks,” the authority noted. The violator then sought permission for erection of the shacks, but went on to violate the terms of the approval. “The Authority decided to impose the penalty of Rs 5 lakh towards the environmental damage caused by the respondent. In future, no permission shall be given by this authority for use of said land. The member secretary to issue directions, accordingly,” the GCZMA said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/coastal-body-fines-shack-operator-rs-5l/articleshow/81595416.cms||---

I am deeply honoured with the support I’ve felt through a difficult phase of pandemic to make Goa strong again,” he tweeted on Friday. Ticking off his achievements in the past two years, the chief minister said that it is during his tenure that a first of its kind maritime cluster has been allotted a plot at the Verna Industrial Estate with focus on creating jobs for youth. The Konkan Maritime Cluster, a consortium of 49 Goan entrepreneurial enterprises in the sunrise sector of ship building, aims to handhold its stakeholders by creating worldclass facilities and thereby allowing the Goan enterprises to compete in the world market. The state government has allotted 14,380 sqm to set up this cluster. A model career centre has been established in Panaji where the employment exchange will extend counselling facilities to job aspirants to help them select jobs best suited to their ability and aptitude, Sawant said. Talking about the 100 electric buses sanctioned by the Union Government for Kadamba Transport Corporation, he said that this will mark the beginning of the corporation’s transformation towards greener transportation, improving operational efficiency and reducing carbon footprint. Among other facilities for which he had laid the foundation stone, Sawant made mention of the Solid Waste Management Facility at Cacora and the Mini Convention Center. Sawant said that under his leadership on October 14, 2020, the state government approved the long awaited Goa Tourism Policy 2020, with a vision to make the state the “most preferred destination around the year for high-spending tourists” in 2024. “On August 30, Goa officially joined the ranks of Open Defecation Free states after the directorate of panchayats and the directorate of municipal administration declared rural and urban areas in the state open defecation free,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sawant-completes-2-yrs-in-office-vows-to-make-goa-swayampurna/articleshow/81595421.cms||---

Goa receives about 9 lakh international travellers with most of them coming from various parts of Russia. “We don’t know if a visa on arrival would be allowed. Very few people travel to Goa on business visa, so we wonder how the airline will be able to sustain its operation on this route,” Travel and Tourism Association of Goa (TTAG) president Nilesh Shah said. He said that there has to be clarity also on the Covid protocols that the travellers and operators need to follow. Shah, however, is hopeful that the government would start issuing visas sooner or later. Goa’s charter season starts in November and goes on till mid-May. However for the first time in the several decades, Goa has not received a single charter. While starred hotels have been able to sustain themselves by relying on domestic tourists, the small hotels that catered to charter tourists have remained shut for the season. Sita Travels chief operating officer Ernest Dias said that the government should issue tourist visas. “In Europe and Russia people are travelling to other countries. Only when tourist visas are issued, people will be able to book their holidays,” he said. Dias said the current season is almost coming to an end, but to enable foreign tourists to book their holidays, the government must declare in advance from when it will start issuing visas. “Otherwise, even the next season will be as bad,” he said. Minar Travels (India) vice-president Abida Kumar said that the direct flight holds no hope in the absence of tourist visas. “Only people having business visas will be able to travel on this flight. But how many people will travel?” he said. While the announcement of a direct flight has come at the time when the tourist season is above to end, the industry can still benefit if tourist visas are issued from next month, and Goa receives one flight a day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ttag-open-tourists-visas-for-goa-russia-direct-flight/articleshow/81595433.cms||---
---||Delhi||Centre blocks Delhi govt's doorstep PDS ration delivery plan||NEW DELHI: Less than a week before the launch of the ambitious doorstep delivery of ration, under 'Mukhya Mantri Ghar Ghar Ration Yojna', in the capital, the Union food ministry has conveyed to the Delhi government it can't use the highly subsidised foodgrains from the central pool under National Food Security Act (NFSA) for the scheme. However, the Centre has said it won't have any objection if the AAP government launches a separate scheme. The communication from the ministry to Delhi's food and civil supplies department, which will fuel another confrontation between the two governments, said the foodgrains allocated to states under NFSA can't be used for any state-specific programme and with a new nomenclature other than the central law. AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj urged the Centre to withdraw its direction and allow the state government to launch the scheme, as scheduled, on March 25. Bharadwaj Says Ration At Doorstep Would Have Curbed GraftBharadwaj said stopping the scheme just four to five days before its launch is highly unfortunate, against the mandate of the people and saddening. “We are aware of the several drawbacks in the ration distribution system across the country. The ration shops should be opened every day but that never happens. These are opened on just twothree days and there are long queues outside. The poor get their ration, which is their right, after going through a lot of trouble,” he said. The ‘Mukhya Mantri Ghar Ghar Ration Yojana’, which was scheduled to be launched on March 25, is a brainchild of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal who campaigned for a public distribution system (PDS) free of corruption and grievances in Delhi years before entering politics. Since he became CM, reforming the PDS has been his priority. In early 2018, the Delhi government had announced its plan to launch doorstep delivery of ration which, however, got stuck as the lieutenant-governor advised the government to send the proposal to the Centre with all implementation details before a final decision was taken. It had triggered a fresh confrontation between the LG and the AAP government and was one of the reasons behind Kejriwal and his cabinet ministers staging a dharna inside Raj Bhawan in June 2018. In its letter, the food ministry said it has gone through Delhi government’s notification of February 20 on the plan to implement the scheme. “It is clarified that the subsidised foodgrains being allocated by the department for food distribution under NFSA cannot be used for operationalisation of any statespecific/other scheme under a different name or nomenclature other than NFSA, as the same is not permissible under the Act,” said the letter. It pointed out that any change in the central Act can be made only by Parliament. It added that states may like to enhance the distribution of subsidised foodgrains, with additional entitlements and more subsidy, but the new nomenclature may be “misinterpreted by the beneficiaries as state benefits and may give rise to confusion regarding their rights under the Act. This means that if the Delhi government still wants to go ahead with the scheme, it will have to either procure foodgrains from the market on its own or buy from Food Corporation of India when it goes for open market sale of wheat and rice. In either case, the city government will have to bear the subsidy. Under NFSA, the Centre bears the burden of subsidy and offers rice, wheat and coarse grains at a price of Rs 3, 2 and 1 per kg, respectively. The Centre also bears the transportation cost of the foodgrains from FCI godowns to the fair price shops or ration shops. A ministry spokesperson said one state cannot unilaterally change the basic elements of the PDS scheme implemented nationally as it consists of features such as the quantity of entitlement and the type of subsidised food the identified categories or specific households are to be given. “States are free to have their own schemes over and above this,” he said. The NFSA only allows delivery of foodgrains to the ration shops from the FCI godowns. Regretting the Centre’s move, Bharadwaj recalled how Kejriwal had decided to tackle the rot in the system. “He knew that the ration dealers get very little commission, which is why they indulge in corruption. Earlier, the commission was just 35 paise but the Kejriwal government increased it to Rs 2. This is the highest commission for ration dealers across the country. The central government still provides 35 paise as commission,” Bharadwaj said, adding that despite the hike in commission, there were several complaints from the poor that in Delhi the ration shops do not open regularly and they suffer as a consequence. “Under this scheme, ration is to be packed by the Delhi government and delivered to the beneficiaries’ doorstep. The central government and the ministry of consumer affairs, food and public distribution were fully aware of this scheme. It is the best scheme for the poor because they would be able to receive ration without any hurdle. This scheme would have prevented rampant corruption,” argued Bharadwaj. “I don’t know why the Centre has a problem if corruption in the ration distribution system stops. We have not asked for a single paisa from the central government to implement this scheme, but despite that it is trying to stop this revolutionary and flagship project of the Delhi government,” he said. In 2018, the then food commissioner had refused to implement the scheme arguing that clearance from the central government was needed to implement it because it falls under NFSA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/centre-blocks-delhi-govts-doorstep-pds-ration-delivery-plan/articleshow/81597786.cms||Dipak K Dash
---||World||Nepal’s dilemma: To take or not to take?||KATHMANDU: A peculiar vaccine drama is unfolding at the international airport in Nepal’s capital. It involves a member of Bahrain’s royal family who arrived with thousands of doses of coronavirus vaccines from China for an expedition to Mount Everest. Before setting out, a team of Bahraini climbers led by Sheikh Mohamed Hamad Mohamed al-Khalifa had announced they would be coming with 2,000 doses of vaccines, which Nepal’s government said would be of the AstraZeneca kind. This move would fulfill a pledge the climbers had made to local villagers during another expedition last September — a promise of generosity that led the villagers to name a local hill “Bahrain Peak”. But when the climbers arrived in Kathmandu on Monday, an inquiry by Nepal’s drug regulators found that the vaccines they were carrying were actually the one developed by Sinopharm, a Chinese state-owned vaccine maker. Nepali authorities now find themselves in a fix: whether to accept the doses or refuse. The doses are being held in cold storage at the airport, and the climbers have been quarantined at a hotel as the authorities ponder how to handle the situation. Nepal has relied on the AstraZeneca vaccine for its rollout. Relying on a donation of one-million doses from India, it has vaccinated about 1.7 million out of its 30 million people. Its efforts have been slowed purportedly because of a delay in delivery of two million doses it bought from Serum Institute. Although Nepal approved emergency use of the Sinopharm vaccine after China pledged 500,000 doses, it has not received the donation. In September, the Bahraini climbers arrived in Nepal to climb two mountains, Mount Manaslu and Lobuche Peak. The doses they were carrying this week were a gift for villagers in Samagaun, a gateway to Mount Manaslu. The Bahraini climbers could not be reached for comment. But Mingma Sherpa, owner of Seven Summit Treks, the agency organising the team’s expedition, said the complications might have resulted from miscommunication between Nepal’s foreign ministry and the health ministry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/nepals-dilemma-to-take-or-not-to-take/articleshow/81597788.cms||---

These buses will run on day basis and not on kilometre basis,” a KTC official told TOI. This means that irrespective of the destination of the buses and irrespective of the number of kilometres these buses cover, the KTC will be paying them for the day’s operations. “This way even if the bus operates 200km or 300km, the rate paid to the winning bidder will be the same. We expect bidders to quote an economical rate for these new buses,” the official said. The tender for 100 mini-buses, which is in the process of being floated, are expected to be run on kilometer basis. “We will use both these options – running of per day basis and running on kilometre basis – and observe which one is a more viable option for the corporation,” the official said. Currently, KTC is prepping for the launch of 30 of its 50 electric vehicles on March 23. The remaining 20 will be delivered to the state next month. Full swing operations of these first batch of buses will commence in Goa from April 1 onwards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ktc-floats-tender-for-500-electric-buses-to-be-leased/articleshow/81595469.cms||---

All eyes are on the event as speculation is rife that Bhaiyyaji Joshi may step down as the ‘sarkaryavaha’ or general secretary of RSS on the second day of the Sangh’s triennial that began in Bengaluru on Friday, its first such meet outside Nagpur. Sources in Nagpur said there are chances that Dattatreya Hosabale, who hails from Shimoga in Karnataka, may take over. The second day may see the election of the ‘sarkaryawah’ only if incumbent Joshi, 73, does not seek another term and all members agree to replace him. He is in his fourth term, each term lasting three years. On Friday, the RSS said anti-national and anti-social forces were trying to foil efforts for a solution to the ongoing farmers’ agitation against three central farm laws. “The prolonged protests are apparently being aimed at creating an environment of disturbance and instability in the country for political gain,” the RSS said in its annual report of 2020-21 released on the first day of the two-day triennial meeting of Akhil Bharatiya Pratinidhi Sabha (ABPS), the RSS’s highest decision-making body. It’s the RSS’s first official statement since the agitation broke out late last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/strong-buzz-rss-could-see-change-of-guard-today/articleshow/81597794.cms||---

While authorities have failed to take up rejuvenation works at the natural spring, the tourist spot is being used by migrant labourers for washing clothes, utensils, and bathing. A photo of the labourers, who are employed at Verna Industrial Estate and reside in the locality, using the spring water for their ablutions recently went viral on social media, drawing the ire of netizens. “These labourers stay in rented premises that are devoid of basic facilities, and then they come to the spring and pollute it,” said chairman of Quelossim Biodiversity Board, Lopinho Xavier. He said that Quelossim panchayat had lodged a complaint at Verna police station six months ago after discussing the issue at the gram sabha. Following this, police began patrolling in the area, which largely addressed the issue, but the labourers have again started visiting the spring, Xavier said. “The PCR van patrols this area at least once a day. As it is a popular spot, we don’t stop tourists from coming there. But we do warn them against littering and drinking. Sometimes, we even make visits on calls made by villagers,” Verna police inspector Sheriff Jacques said. Anti-social elements also frequent the spot, especially at night, Xavier said. The spring is in need of urgent maintenance, and several representations by the panchayat to the water resources department and Goa Tourism Development Corporation (GTDC) have been ignored.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/kesarval-spring-being-polluted-by-labourers/articleshow/81595502.cms||Ruvina Khan

What’s more, it took two years to reply to a citizen who had sought reasons for the delay in completion of the road from Manewada via Manish Nagar T-point to Besa. The PWD got the work order on May 12, 2016, and the deadline was November 11, 2016. But despite missing several extended deadlines, the PWD has failed to complete the road work. Now, PWD is blaming the Besa gram panchayat for not providing encroachment free road, causing the delay. Gajanan Kharpuriya, gram vikas officer, Besa, slammed PWD’s statement. Kharpuriya said the 3km road widening work is part of the development plan. Being an executing agency of the DP road work, it is the responsibility of the PWD to raze encroachments and illegal constructions to carry out the work, he said. The incomplete job is now posing threat to motorists, say local residents. The existing road is very narrow, while vehicular traffic has increased manifold due to urbanization in this part of the city. The road width was to be increased from 25ft to 65ft, considering the growing population. The PWD outsourced the work to Jagdamba Constructions for Rs 148.58 lakh. A citizen of the locality had raised the slow work in a letter on Aapli Sarkar portal in 2019. The PWD sent its reply recently where it blamed the Besa gram panchayat for the delay in completion of the work. It admitted that not shifting a temple near Bank of India Square at Besa was hindering the road work. The PWD also expressed its inability to complete the construction of storm water networks alongside the road due to many encroachments on DP road land. “Unless we get the roadside portion clear, we will not be able to complete the road widening work and the construction of storm water networks,” the letter read. The lackadaisical attitude of the PWD engineers once again came to fore as they failed to include shifting of utility networks from beneath the road and electric poles. It has now expressed its inability to shift the utilities to complete the road widening work. The incomplete road is not only causing accidents, but also witnessing frequent traffic jams, pointed out Dr Pramod Barde, a local resident. “If the PWD does not finish the incomplete road works, residents will launch an agitation and also move the high court,” said local residents Rohit Hijib, and shopkeeper Husain Ali.

Their cost comes to around Rs 700 crore. The MoRTH wants the state government to share the burden and it had also suggested animal overpasses instead of underpasses to reduce cost.However, MoRTH has started work on one of the most crucial 750-metre underpasses near Shivapur (Bander) and Khadsangi which is a crucial tiger corridor between Tadoba-Ghodazari-Bramhapuri-Umred-Karhandla. There is recorded evidence of tigers using this patch to reach other PAs.“We have started work on the 750-metre-long and 5-metre-high underpass after getting all clearances. We have also created a kuccha road along the proposed underpass for traffic diversion to expedite work, which is expected to be completed in five months,” said executive engineer Vivek Mishra.Bramhapuri deputy conservator (DyCF) Dipesh Malhotra said, “The road work had recently caused a flutter among greens on social media but actual work on underpass has started after clearance from MoEFCC. Considering the road a wildlife crossing, the user agency has been asked to take precautions. It felled 180 trees instead of 240 marked.”“These roads pass through corridors where tiger density is maximum in the country and human-carnivore conflict has caused maximum deaths, mainly due to landscape connectivity issues and habitat fragmentation. In such a situation, mitigation measures are essential on these roads,” said the state wildlife board member Kishor Rithe.“The NTCA and NGT have actually provided a win-win solution for an area where re-aligning the road is not possible. Reluctance to provide mitigation will actually cost the taxpayer more money as project delays mean massive cost escalations,” says Milind Pariwakam of Wildlife Conservation Trust (WCT), the NGO which conducted a 3-year-long camera trapping study to provide site-specific solutions for mitigation.“Mitigation measures on the Chandrapur-Mul and Bamni-Navegaon roads are critical as the former stretch is in the eco-sensitive zone of Tadoba and the latter encompasses Kanhargaon wildlife sanctuary. These roads pass through the most important tiger corridors and show a high frequency of tiger movement,” said Aditya Joshi, wildlife biologist.IMP BOXMitigation MeasuresRoad Structures Length (Mtrs)Nagbhid-Armori 2 300, 150Chimur-Warora 1 750Mul-Chandrapur 10 300 (6), 750 (4)Bamni-Navegaon 5 300 (1), 750 (4)Gadchiroli-Mul 1 30Hinganghat-Mul 5 750 (1), 300 (2), 30(2)Nagbhid-Mul 2 750 (1), 300 (1)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/work-on-first-750m-wildlife-underpass-starts-near-tadoba/articleshow/81594462.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

The Supreme Court had quashed OBC reservations in the elections clarifying that 50% quota limit can’t be breached. Addressing the media here, the BJP leader said as the Maharashtra government was ignoring OBC’s genuine demands, they need to stand up and protest on roads. “The government had over one year and four months to collect OBC data, but they did nothing. Also, they did not set up a commission to calculate their population. There would be a statewide agitation of OBCs for reservation soon,” he said. Bawankule demanded the government to immediately constitute a commission for OBCs and seek time from the top court to collect their data. “The three-party coalition government is meting out injustice to the OBC community, just like it did in case of Marathas. The BJP government under then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had promulgated ordinance for OBC reservation, which the MVA government has allowed to lapse,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bawankule-warns-of-stir-over-obc-quota/articleshow/81594499.cms||---

The Sena also said “a lobby in Delhi” was upset with Singh because of his actions, including his unearthing of the TRP case. Saamna lauded Singh’s achievements, saying he had taken over in a very difficult period (the pandemic). It also criticised the BJP which had demanded that “political bosses” of API Sachin Waze be found, saying there were no political bosses in such cases. Reshuffle in police force aimed at unearthing motive, says SaamnaParambir) Singh encouraged the police force to fight against Covid and visited crucial hotspots like Dharavi on his own. He also boosted the morale of the police during the Sushant Singh Rajput and Kangana cases, hence even a CBI probe could not reveal more than the Mumbai police investigation. The TRP case was also unearthed during Parambir Singh’s tenure, and a lobby in Delhi was upset with him because of all this,” Saamna stated. “The major reshuffle in the Mumbai and state police force has been done in specific circumstances with the intention of not sparing the culprit, and if it is a murder or suicide, to find the motive behind it. The opposition should believe this,” the paper pointed out. Saamna further stated, “Everyone is sad about the suspicious death of Mansukh Hiran. The BJP is deeply saddened, but no one spoke about BJP MP Ramswaroop Sharma’s suspicious death in Delhi and MP Mohan Delkar’s suicide, and everyone has forgotten Sushant Singh Rajput and his family. One should learn from the current opposition how to make a big issue out of someone’s death.” The Sena also alleged that the NIA had taken over the probe into the explosives case only to defame the Maharashtra government. “The opposition raised many questions over Hiran’s death, but as soon as the state Anti-Terrorist Squad registered a case of murder and initiated a probe, the National Investigation Agency took over the case. It seems that there was no ‘noble motive’ other than to defame the Maharashtra government,” the paper stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-shiv-sena-defends-ex-cp-parambir-singh-says-transfer-doesnt-imply-guilt/articleshow/81597804.cms||---

Rizvi, who is the former chairman of the Shia Waqf Board in Uttar Pradesh, has filed a public interest litigation in the Supreme Court seeking the removal of 26 verses from the holy book. According to him, the verses teach violence. This has led to a strong reaction from Muslim groups across the country. Mohammed Farooq Shaikh, the state president of MRM, led a group of protesters to the Kotwali police station demanding the arrest of Rizvi for inciting religious hatred. Shaikh also heads the city unit of BJP’s minority cell. Shaikh told TOI that the petition will only incite the fundamentalists who may use the issue to their advantage. “The petition can provide an excuse to fundamentalists to spread hate in the name of discrimination against Muslims in India,” he said. Questioning the basis of the petition, Shaikh asked, “How can any religious text that is in existence since centuries be amended? ”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/26-verses-rss-bjp-arms-seek-arrest-of-ex-shia-panel-chief/articleshow/81597806.cms||Shishir Arya

---||Nagpur||‘No CBSE student will suffer academically due to Covid’||In an exclusive live webinar with TOI, Sanyam Bhardwaj, controller of examinations for CBSE in Delhi, answered queries from students, parents and teachers about practical exams, Covid-19 situation and how CBSE will adapt during theory papers from across India and abroad too.Covid-19 cases are rising rapidly in some states and government is closing down schools as precaution. How will practical exams be conducted?Laxmi Vineeth, MumbaiThere is absolutely no need to worry because we have given schools a lot of flexibility here. In a normal year, practicals would have to be wrapped up in January itself. But now these practical exams can be conducted till June, so there is no immediate need for schools to worry about. In Kuwait, schools are closed till September. How will practical and theory exams be conducted here?Peter D, KuwaitWe will definitely take into account all these things and work towards a solution as CBSE has been conducting board exams internationally for a long time. Through our country’s embassy there, we will coordinate with the Kuwait authorities and I am sure we will get permission to conduct the exams. Students have been taught practicals through online simulations, as suggested by CBSE. So why can’t we conduct practical exams online?Shalu Singh (Mumbai) & Bharti Kathale, WardhaWe would not want any of our students to face questions about credibility of their evaluation. Else for a long time, they will face a remark that somehow they had it easier. We want their assessments to be done in a uniform manner. Even if students have been taught online, they will still be able to perform the practicals in physical mode. Schools can call students a day before the practical exam and conduct a practice session in physical mode. What happens if lockdown is announced in my city during exam period?Shankar Chandan, Shubham SinhaThough I am very hopeful that by the time we approach exam time, situation will be much better. Still even if that happens, CBSE will find a solution. Let the problem first knock on our doors, we will deal with it then. Maharashtra government today declared ‘home centre’ for upcoming X & XII exam. Will CBSE consider a similar policy?Jayashri Bhake (Nagpur), Sonia Kapoor Singh (Via FB)CBSE conducts board exams across the country and abroad in over 25,000 schools. There are too many variables involved and at all times our priority is to ensure that the exam is conducted fairly. So, this is not something which will be possible for us. But at the same time, we have increased number of centres, so students have less distance to travel. What happens if student turns Covid-19 positive. Will he be able to appear for exams? Dharmendra Mourya, Dhara Tripathi (via FB page)For this, we will need to create awareness among parents. Every parent must keep tabs on their child’s health and inform school if he/she is Covid-19 positive. And they (parents) must be rest assured that no students of ours will suffer academically because of the pandemic. We will ensure that such children get a second chance later. Too less gap between Sanskrit and Math exams. Is there a possibility of CBSE datesheet (timetable) being changed?Dinesh Dewan (Via FB)We have to conduct exams for almost 240 papers. So, the datesheet has to be set not only by looking at the subjects but also the combination of subjects taken by students. The datesheet has been prepared by keeping everything in mind. Will teachers be allowed to evaluate papers from home?Sameer Singh (via FB)We are planning for things just as if it was a normal year. So, we will follow the same protocol that was in place during non-Covid times. Students haven't been able to learn in physical classrooms, are less prepared. What will be the level of question papers?LJ Makasare, NagpurPaper is always easy for a student who prepares for it. There is still enough time left to revise for different subjects. The question paper is set using established norms, so for us the concept of easy or tough does not arise. How the boards will be conducted in May if the cases rise drastically till that time? I ask this because in March only we are observing a surge in the number of cases throughout the country.Archisa Ratn, Nagpur (via email)We are confident that cases will subside by the time exams begin. Still, we will figure out a solution if the situation continues to be bad. When you prepare question paper, are most of the questions taken from NCERT books , or external books?Pooja Kashyap (via email)The questions are set by experts who use their subject knowledge to frame them. The entire syllabi is what is mentioned in the NCERT books. So definitely there is no truth in the matter than private publisher books are used for question paper setting. I’m a class 12 student. If I test positive during the exams, will I be able to give the remaining exams?Madho (via email)If any student is unable to appear for the exam due to health reasons, he/she will be given another chance. If you are unwell, inform your school in writing. Some students are currently back in their hometown, while their school is at a different location. At CBSE we have provided them the option of appearing at a different city or country. So all the details will be available with the school, and students have to apply through their respective alma mater only. Also, these applications have to be submitted by March 25. Will the evaluation be lenient this time?Evaluation is always done as per the marking scheme. So, we don’t give instructions to teachers about tough or easy. Do students have to wear uniform during board exam?That’s the practice. We ask students to ensure they are in their school uniform while appearing for exams.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-cbse-student-will-suffer-academically-due-to-covid/articleshow/81608445.cms||---
---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: Covid an enemy of the nervous system||VISAKHAPATNAM: In the initial months of the Covid-19 outbreak, doctors were primarily focussed on undoing the damage the virus does to the lungs and the circulatory system. However, with growing medical evidence over the last one year, doctors are increasingly witnessing neurological manifestations among active as well as recovered Covid-19 patients. Neurological manifestations are being observed especially in patients with comorbidities and those affected in a more severe way by the virus. The spectrum of neurological conditions ranges from common malaise, headache, footdrop and myelitis to encephalopathy, encephalitis, loss of smell and taste, stroke, Guillain-Barre syndrome, ‘brain fog’, loss of vision, facial palsy, and Miller Fisher syndrome. Speaking to TOI, Dr P Ranganadham, senior consultant neurologist at Sunshine Hospitals in Gachibowli, Hyderabad said that Covid-19 affects both central and peripheral nervous systems. “The virus may enter either through the olfactory system or the haematogenous (blood) route by invading the blood-brain barrier. In normal conditions, the same barrier allows only nutrients to the brain and protects it from toxins and pathogens. As the oxygen supply is limited in case of Covid-19 due to lung damage, it would often lead to hypoxic brain damage. The novel coronavirus-induced unrestrained cytokine storm may also cause neuronal dysfunctions,” said Dr Ranganadham. Explaining the worldwide trends in Covid-19-induced neurological conditions, Dr Ranganadham said that the autopsies conducted on patients who died of Covid-19 in Italy revealed a condition called ‘disseminated intravascular coagulation’. “Since then, doctors have started recommending anti-coagulants. The geological distribution of neurological manifestations grossly varies from country to country, and even in different parts of India,” Dr Ranganadham added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/covid-an-enemy-of-the-nervous-system/articleshow/81593539.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

The state has been consistently recording more than 200 daily cases for the last one week. The toll increased to 7,187 as one more patient succumbed to the pandemic in Prakasam district. With the increasing daily cases, the active case load now stands at 1,909. The recovery rate dropped below the 99% mark to 98.9% on Friday, for the first time in two months, from its once peak of almost 99.2% in February. Amid the increasing cases in the districts, health minister Alla Kali Krishna Srinivas (Nani) conducted a review meet on the Covid-19 vaccination drive with the health officials. “Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy directed the health department to increase the daily Covid-19 tests in view of the surge in case numbers, and consider the village secretariat as a unit for administering the vaccine to the public. The officials should concentrate more on Covid-19 prevention measures in the state, instead of focusing on treating the infected persons. A comprehensive plan should be prepared to extend the coverage of the vaccination drive,” said Nani. The health minister asked the officials to switch over to 100% RT-PCR based Covid-19 tests. Nani spoke to Anantapur officials on Friday after a few students of the government medical college tested positive for the virus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/covid-recovery-rate-drops-below-99/articleshow/81593546.cms||---

Responding to a query posed by YSRC Rajya Sabha member V Vijayasai Reddy, the railway minister said that the AP government has consented to share 50 per cent of the cost of the Kadapa–Bangalore railway line via Madanapalle, but the government has deposited only Rs 132.29 crore towards its share of the project. The 21.3km-long Kadapa–Pendlimarri section was completed and commissioned in April 2017, Goyal said while adding that further execution would be taken up only after deposition of the state’s share. Execution of four new line projects is held up due to non-acquisition of land and non-deposition of state share, the minister said while adding that Rs 1,634.34 crore is outstanding from the AP government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/rly-line-awaits-states-share-of-funds-minister/articleshow/81593552.cms||---

Amid protests by farmers who demanded proof that it was indeed the killer tiger, forest officials said its stripes matched those of the big cat lurking in the forests and the carcass bore gunshot wounds too, from the shots fired by sharpshooters on March 8.

The child had a narrow escape while his parents lay on the busy Bareilly-Nainital highway — bleeding profusely — for 25 minutes even as passersby made videos instead of rushing them to a nearby hospital, reports Kanwardeep Singh. A video of the incident went viral on social media and police finally rushed to the spot to shift the couple to a medical facility. In the video, a person can be seen asking the couple to inform their family while another person is heard asking them to call cops.“Things could have been different if the passerbys had taken them to a hospital instead of making videos.

Her instant decision came when the compere at the rally welcomed her in English to which she objected and enquired if the compere can speak in Hindi. After this, the organisers changed the compere and proceeded with the event in Hindi. Maurya and state forest minister Harak Singh Rawat were the chief guests of the bike rally that was flagged off from Raj Bhawan. As the two took to the stage, the compere started the proceedings by saying, “We welcome you governor ma’am to the event…”. Before she could finish her lines, Maurya objected to the use of English and interjected, “Yeh angrezi mein kyon kar rahi hain baat, Hindi mein karein.” During her speech, Maurya also stressed on the use of Hindi pointing out that “countries like Japan and China were successful as people of these nations did not feel ashamed of their mother tongue.” “Speeches and compering in English won’t be allowed,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/hindi-only-uttarakhand-guv-stops-compere-at-event/articleshow/81597829.cms||Ishita Mishra

For youngsters with a yen for foreign policy, MEA is reopening its doors to internships. According to a new and improved policy, MEA will be taking in about 60 interns every year in two batches, with each intern spending three months in the ministry. The idea is to bring young people from different parts of the country to experience the making of foreign policy up close. Harsh Shringla, foreign secretary ordered a review of a 2016 internship policy. The rollout intends to cover almost all states and Union Territories of India. Diversity and gender inclusiveness, underprivileged backgrounds, both rural and urban are key benchmarks here, officials said. Each “batch” will feature interns from 14 states and four UTs. The selectors are aiming to get 30-50% female representation. Internships are regarded as important learning processes certainly in the US government, which attracts droves of youngsters fresh off college learning on the job, so to speak. Officials said the MEA template could be replicated in other ministries to attract young people, who, many believe, are increasingly disenchanted and disengaged from government and its processes. In India, the effort, officials say, is to try and make the selection process as impersonal as possible given that such recruitments invite “recommendations” from people with “connections”. The selection process, therefore, is fully online, through a dedicated portal and two-step screening processes. Priority, they said, would be given to youngsters coming from the Transformation of Aspirational Districts Programme (TADP). Both class 12 and bachelor’s degree results will be weighed together. Interns will work in the different divisions of the MEA, a little like the IFS probationers do.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mea-reopens-doors-to-interns-cvs-pour-in/articleshow/81597832.cms||Indrani Bagchi

It was issued on the letter head of BJP's minority cell. Rizvi, who is the former chairman of the Shia Waqf Board in UP, has filed a public interest litigation in the Supreme Court seeking the removal of 26 verses from the book. He alleges that it teaches violence. This has led to a strong reaction from Muslim groups across the country. Mohammed Farooq Shaikh, the state president of MRM, led a group of protesters to the Kotwali police station demanding the arrest of Rizvi for inciting religious hatred. Shaikh also heads the city unit of BJP’s minority cell. Shaikh told TOI that the petition will only incite the fundamentalists who may use the issue to their advantage. “The petition can provide an excuse to fundamentalists to spread hate in the name of discrimination against Muslims in India,” he said. Questioning the basis of the petition, Shaikh asked, “How can any religious text that is in existence since centuries be amended. This would also send a wrong message about the country.” A copy of the petition demanding Rizvi’s arrest was also sent to Union transport minister and Nitin Gadkari who is the Nagpur MP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rss-bjp-demand-arrest-of-up-man/articleshow/81593775.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Nagpur||3 cops caught drinking liquor at ACP’s office, suspended||NAGPUR: A sting operation by a citizen has led to the suspension of three cops, including an assistant sub-inspector (ASI). The cops were caught on a mobile camera having a liquor party in the office of the assistant commissioner of police, Lakadganj division, with some civilians. The shocking video and the related issues are now being probed by an officer of inspector rank. The incident led to city police chief Amitesh Kumar calling an urgent meeting on Friday to discuss the issue. “We are contemplating on means to avoid such reckless behaviour by cops in future, considering the gravity of the situation. Corrective measures have been taken,” he said. The six-minute video was shot on March 10 inside the ACP’s office at Shanti Nagar, where three cops, identified as ASI Ganesh Lade, head constables Ratnakar Meshram and Pradeep Rao, are seen enjoying liquor and some eatables on their tables while chatting with civilians. There is animated discussion regarding some property matters during the liquor party, which kicks off after a citizen is seen entering the room with liquor bottles in his pocket. He keeps the bottles on the table before the cops as the party begins. According to a source, the video was likely shot by a man who had approached Shanti Nagar police station with a complaint over a property dispute in the past. As the senior officers were already dealing with the complaint, it’s learnt ASI Lade had lured the complainant to settle the matter in his favour. Lade is likely to have asked the civilian to come with some liquor and food to the ACP’s office in the evening, where he was to introduce him to the other cops who can help him too. The man outsmarted Lade by filming the entire episode. Zonal DCP Lohit Matani, who followed instructions of Kumar to suspend the three cops, said incumbent ACP (Sachin Thorbole) had joined office on March 11, while the video was shot a day earlier. So, no senior officers would be held responsible. In the past, Matani had sent 11 cops of Shanti Nagar police station to headquarters after they had failed to prevent a murder.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/3-cops-caught-drinking-liquor-at-acps-office-suspended/articleshow/81593793.cms||Soumitra Bose

Apart from the illness, Meshram was also in the dock after an FIR was registered against him in a questionable manner by Thane police in a case of abetment to suicide. However, the court extended him respite by granting an ad-interim bail. On the first day after resuming duty, Meshram took dreaded goon Majid Khan into custody after apprehending him with a sharp weapon at Billal Nagar. Khan has around 11 offences against him. After taking action under the Arms Act, Meshram also raided a liquor den. Three history-sheeters were checked by a squad under the supervision of Meshram. During the day, the Yashodhara Nagar police under Meshram checked 218 vehicles, including 68 four-wheelers, at two nakabandi points at Automotive Chowk and Vitabhatti chowk. Around 16 vehicles were detained and slapped with fine to the tune of Rs23,200. Besides, Meshram also completed patrolling of substantial areas under him. “Everyone can overcome Covid provided he or she has mental strength to come out of it,” he said. The case against him too could not damage Meshram’s confidence. “I was nowhere connected with the abetment to suicide case of Thane. Even the court has asked for evidence from police,” said Meshram. “The matter was related to a case when someone else was the police station in-charge,” he said. The PI added that he did not even know the deceased, Sachin Sable, who was a government employee, along with others involved in the case. “My performance will not be affected by either coronavirus or any controversies,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/sr-pi-back-in-action-after-beating-covid/articleshow/81593831.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||India||Recommend successor, Centre writes to Bobde||NEW DELHI: Setting the process for change of guard at the top of the judiciary in motion, the Union government on Friday wrote to Chief Justice S A Bobde, who retires on April 23, to recommend the name of his successor, a convention that has been followed since the collegium took over the process of selecting judges in the 1990s. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad wrote to CJI Bobde requesting him to nominate his successor, who would be appointed as the 48th CJI, official sources said. Justice N V Ramana, the senior-most among SC judges, is in line to succeed Justice Bobde. As per convention, the CJI recommends the name of the senior-most SC judge as successor a month ahead of his retirement. So it is expected that CJI Bobde will recommend Justice Ramana’s name as his successor by March 23, sources said. The memorandum of procedure for appointment of CJI says “appointment to the office of the Chief Justice of India should be of the senior-most judge of the Supreme Court considered fit to hold the office”. It says the law minister, at the appropriate time, would seek the recommendation of the outgoing CJI for the appointment of the next CJI. “Whenever there is any doubt about the fitness of the senior-most judge to hold the office of the Chief Justice of India, consultation with other judges as envisaged in Article 124 (2) of the Constitution would be made for appointment of the next Chief Justice of India,” the MoP provides. ‘After receipt of the recommendation of the CJI, the law minister will put up the recommendation to the prime minister who will advise the President in the matter of appointment,” it says. Justice Ramana will have a tenure of one year, four months and three days. Born in an agricultural family on August 27, 1957, in Krishna district of Andhra Pradesh, Ramana started his practice as an advocate nearly four decades ago in Andhra Pradesh HC. He was appointed as a permanent judge of the HC on June 27, 2000. He became an SC judge on February 17, 2014.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/recommend-successor-centre-writes-to-bobde/articleshow/81597858.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The decision was taken during an emergent management council meeting. As per NU statutory members, the agency was roped in when the theory papers were just a week away. It is learnt that no efforts were made for the last three months to seek a new firm since 2020 summer exams. Senate member Manmohan Bajpayee had told TOI on Friday that NU would be entrusting the exams to Promarc again. In February, vice chancellor Subhash Chaudhari had ruled out roping in Promarc on account of lapses committed by it during summer exams. Not only did the app crash repeatedly, its servers also became unresponsive many times forcing NU to conduct re-exams of many subjects. Though NU conducted papers of only 72,000 final year students, it gave nightmares to the examinees due to lack of preparedness by the Ramdaspeth firm. Promarc also tried to conduct Amravati University’s online exams. After repeated blunders, it was blacklisted. Even the Gondwana University had severed its contract with the firm. On Friday, NU administration tabled a proposal of Promarc stating that it hadn’t floated any tender, but continued the firm as other agencies quoted very high rates. VC and pro-VC Sanjay Dudhe refused to answer TOI’s calls. Board of Examination and Evaluation (BOEE) director Prafulla Sable defended the NU’s decision. “We haven’t given any new contract to Promarc, but added exam work into its terms and conditions for on-screen evaluation. Since we're conducting exams on MCQ pattern, there’s no requirement for any evaluation. Therefore, we told them to instead conduct winter exams. It was clearly written in their contract that they would be doing any other work as assigned by the university,” he said. Box Exams through web-based link on mobile BOEE Prafulla Sable director told TOI that NU would be conducting exams through a web-based link that would be received by students on their mobiles and computers. “The web-link will come up with full proctoring. It will inform NU about examinees’ location and other details. The link would take a picture of a student and match it with one on the server. The Promarc would be roping in Microsoft for using its Azure software for the exams,” he said. Sable added that Microsoft had assured three cover-up and three back-up servers. “A team of Microsoft workers in the city which would be an added advantage to us, as coordination would be easier. Last time, we needed to coordinate in Hyderabad for Promarc’s servers,” Sable said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/in-u-turn-nu-hands-over-exam-contract-to-promarc/articleshow/81593844.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Foresters have arrested three persons from Palagaon village for poisoning the water body and killing the animals. Combing operations will be taken up in the surrounding jungles to verify if there is any other death of wild animal after drinking poisoned water from the pond. “Poachers had poisoned the pond for bush-meat. Two nilgais and 16 goats were killed after drinking the poisoned water. The matter came to light after foresters got information that some people have brought meat to the village for sale. They rounded up the accused and investigation revealed poisoning of water in the pond,” said CCF, Chandrapur, NR Pravin while talking to TOI. As the foresters, led by in-charge RFO Mahesh Gaikwad reached the pond, they discovered the two carcasses of nilgai. One of them was cleaned of its skin. Apart from this, 16 goats too were found dead in the dried bed of the pond. The death of the goats irked the villagers and police too were summoned to the spot immediately. However, as the matter was related to poaching of wild animals, an offence was registered against the poachers by the forest department. Pravin said the poachers who poisoned the water in pond have been identified as Nikesh Nannaware (37), Praneet Dhanvijay (23) and Anna Bankar (55), all residents of Palasgaon village. He, however, said that it is yet not clear when the trio poisoned the pond. He said the foresters will carry out combing operation in the forest surrounding the pond as per the standard operating procedure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/2-nilgais-16-goats-die-after-drinking-poisoned-water-from-chanda-pond/articleshow/81593865.cms||Mazhar Ali

The opposition parties, meanwhile, challenged the amendment by calling it a bid to bring home much-needed revenue for the Centre rather than reform the mining sector. The minister said the bill will end two regimes for mining and will allow auctioning of mines that were allotted as far back as 1980. He said at base value, without adding premium, the 570-odd mines will add up to Rs 27 lakh crore. He said the value of these mines is being lost to the county at present. Joshi, however, maintained that the reform in the mining sector would generate “55 lakh direct and indirect employment”. He also said India produces 95 minerals and has same potential like South Africa and Australia but still import minerals like gold and coal. According to the minister, the mining sector currently contributes 1.75% to the country’s GDP and through the reforms proposed in the bill the contribution will rise to 2.5% and strengthen the economy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ls-okays-bill-on-mining-reforms-mantri-says-will-raise-revenue/articleshow/81597848.cms||---

After walking out from Rajya Sabha, leader of opposition Mallikarjun Kharge likened the Modi government to East India company, who will ensure the rule of foreigners for a long time because the said amendment in insurance bill allows for foreign ownership of insurance companies. “Like East India company invested in India and ruled the country for hundreds of years, there are ‘West India Company’ people here, they are from Gujarat. They believe in privatisation and PM Modi is ever ready to help them. It is happening in railways, roads, hotel, banking. All these sectors provide job reservation and it is an attempt to end the quotas for SCs/STs/OBCs,” Kharge said, flanked by MPs from CPI, CPM, RJD, Shiv Sena, NCP, DMK. He said there were lakhs of jobs in the insurance companies alone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/insurance-fdi-bill-regressive-oppn/articleshow/81597870.cms||---

Ejaz Sheikh, who is in his late 20s, was nabbed from his home after an animal rights activist called the police and filed a complaint late on Thursday night. The police said that Sheikh seem to be having a learning disability. “On Thursday night, I got a call from some locals that an injured stray dog was lying near the Ward 8 office. I reached there and saw that the dog had grievous injuries on its head and other body parts. I rushed it to the hospital,” said Dayanand Trivedi, who works for animal welfare in the city. “Later some locals told me that Sheikh had thrashed the dog. They said that the accused first tied the dog with a belt and kept hitting it with a rod. He then tied the dog to his two-wheeler and dragged it for half a kilometre from his home to ward 8 office and threw it there,” Trivedi told TOI. He added that the dog’s teeth are broken and it is in critical condition. The police have booked Sheikh under the Animal Welfare Act. “The dog has been seen in the Machhipeeth area for years. Many locals feed the canine daily. No one knows why he assaulted the dog so badly but it was very cruel of Sheikh,” Trivedi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/man-drags-dog-for-500-m-on-scooter/articleshow/81594611.cms||---

The poll panel is mulling a proposal by its special observers in Bengal that a 100 metre zone around polling booths be manned only by central forces. And only central forces would man the booths. Mamata Banerjee is running a campaign based on lies against BJP leaders. She insulted the Election Commission sayin… https://t.co/n9dtVgO3TL— Bhupender Yadav (@byadavbjp) 1616161466000In its memorandum to EC, Trinamool said: “On the first count, it has been reported in the media that the ECI has decided to not permit the presence of State police within 100 m of polling stations and only deploy Central Forces in such an arena. If true, this decision is unprecedented and casts severe aspersions on the reputation of the police administration in the State of West Bengal.” Emphasising that the poll panel’s decision was only for Bengal and not for the other four poll-bound states, TMC said central forces should be deployed to help the state government deal with law and order and “not deliberately demonise the state police personnel”. “Propriety demands that there should be proper coordination between the State and Central forces to ensure free and fair elections and that combined groups of both State and Central Police forces be deployed within 100 m of the polling booths,” the Trinamool letter said. The party’s parliamentary delegation, including Saugata Roy, Yashwant Sinha, Md Nadimul Haque, Pratima Mondal and Mahua Moitra, described EC’s approach as “biased”. Additional chief electoral officer (CEO) Sanjay Basu said: “It has come to our notice in a news item that there will be no state police within 100 metre radius of the booths. There is no such order from EC. I am not speaking about booths but 100 metre radius of booths. I have not said about it. We will work as per directives of EC.” Later, a BJP team comprising M A Naqvi, Bhupender Yadav, Debasree Chaudhuri, Anil Baluni and Om Pathak met the poll panel at Nirvachan Sadan. Chaudhuri said: “We also apprised EC on the issue of central forces. We wanted EC to ensure that central forces remain in the polling booths. We left it to EC to take an appropriate decision.” The BJP delegation also urged the poll panel for a detailed report on the March 10 Nandigram incident, for which, it said, the Bengal CM was repeatedly “blaming the BJP”. Campaigning in East Midnapore, Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh questioned the role of state police during elections. “They (Trinamool) did not let people file nominations for panchayat elections or cast votes.” TMC MP Moitra said: “We met the EC and raised three points — the rule under which they are proposing to put only central forces within 100 metres of a polling booth, only 5% of VVPAT checking instead of 100%, and the incident involving the attack on the chief minister on March 10.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/west-bengal/trinamool-bjp-move-poll-panel-over-100m-booth-buffer-against-state-police/articleshow/81602016.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal elections: Enforcement Directorate, CBI call 6 state officials for questioning in 3 cases||KOLKATA: Two central agencies on Friday called six Bengal government officials for questioning as part of their ongoing probes in three separate cases, prompting the Trinamool Congress to call it an example of “brazen misuse of power” by the central government. The officials called for questioning next week by the Enforcement Directorate and the Central Bureau of Investigation are state security adviser Surajit Kar Purakayastha (Saradha case); principal secretary in chief minister’s office Gautam Sanyal and state additional chief secretary B P Gopalika (Metro Dairy share transfer and disinvestment case); GST special commissioner (Durgapur) Arun Prasad, Kolkata Police additional commissioner Laxmi Narayan Meena and West Bengal Police officer Partha Ghosh (illegal coal-mining case). The fresh notices to these six officials came on Friday, when the ED questioned Trinamool Congress candidates Vivek Gupta (Jorasanko) and Madan Mitra (Kamarhati) in the Saradha case. Another central agency, the National Investigation Agency, questioned another Trinamool Congress candidate, Imani Biswas (Suti), in connection with the February Nimtita railway station blast case. The Trinamool Congress saw political vendetta in the renewed activity of central government agencies in poll-bound Bengal.  “The BJP is so brazen about all this now. They don’t even bother to make a pretence of fair play. This is classic Modi-Shah tactic,” Trinamool Rajya Sabha leader Derek O’Brien said. Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee, too, had urged the Election Commission to probe “the role of central agencies in Bengal” while releasing her party’s manifesto; it followed an ED notice to state home secretary H K Dwivedi to appear before it in connection with the Metro Dairy disinvestment case. A state official admitted the notices had come. “It seems to be part of a political carpet-bombing to keep the state administration under pressure,” he said. Another official close to the developments said there was no question of not cooperating with the agencies. “All things known will be shared. The reference points for the central agencies are, anyway, mostly out in the public domain,” he said. Kamarhati Trinamool candidate Madan Mitra on Friday said he had already submitted all necessary documents to the ED and there was nothing more to provide. “I have come because they have asked me to do that. I have always cooperated with the agency,” he said. The CBI and the ED are probing the Saradha Ponzi scam, which broke in 2013 and in which thousands of investors were alleged to have lost about Rs 2,400 crore. The ED is probing the Metro Dairy case, in which there have been allegations that the Bengal government sold its 47% stake in the firm at a lower-than-market value. The CBI is probing the illegal coal-mining case; it has accused several central government officials and Bengal residents of colluding to “cheat” central government agencies in coal auctions. Prime accused Anup Majhi has moved the Supreme Court, raising jurisdiction issues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ed-cbi-call-6-state-officials-for-questioning-in-3-cases/articleshow/81596070.cms||Rohit Khanna
