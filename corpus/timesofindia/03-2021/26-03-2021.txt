Ambani, the chairman and managing director of Reliance Industries, also said India is surging ahead as an economic, democratic, diplomatic, strategic and cultural power. "As I look at the India of today and tomorrow, I see a tsunami of opportunities for entrepreneurs. There are two reasons for my confidence. "Firstly, our PM Narendra Modi has been advocating a greater role for the private sector in India's future development," Ambani said at the EY Entrepreneur of the Year awards. Last month, Modi had pitched for greater importance of the private sector, stating that the culture of abusing the private sector is no longer acceptable. Ambani said the second reason for the 'tsunami of opportunities' is the availability of technologies which can be utilised for helping 1.3 billion Indians meet their aspirations. "We have the potential in the coming decades to be among the top three economies of the world. New sectors like clean energy, education, healthcare, life sciences and biotechnology, and transformation of existing agricultural, industrial and service sectors offer unprecedented opportunities,” Ambani said. Indian entrepreneurs are now capable of providing world-beating quality to meet the needs of our market at the most competitive costs, he said, adding this opens up the entire global market for Indian entrepreneurs. In a message to young entrepreneurs on the verge of starting new enterprises, Ambani said they should not be deterred by failures and made it clear that success awaits them after the setbacks. "You will script far better success stories for India than my generation," he added. Speaking at the event, Infosys co-founder N R Narayana Murthy said corporate leaders have to assemble a group of thinkers from the society to recognize and understand the complete list of risks which a business faces, and added that he is “humbled” by the pandemic. Kotak Mahindra Bank's Uday Kotak said business has to go beyond quarter-to-quarter and convince investors that the company is building something which will be a bigger success in the future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/pms-private-sector-thrust-creates-tsunami-of-opportunities-for-entrepreneurs-ambani/articleshow/81695025.cms||---

The Massachusetts-based Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard will use the funds to build a new center that will bring together academia and industry to merge the two disciplines in an effort to make people healthier. “Until now, these fields have largely developed in parallel,” the Broad Institute said in a statement on Thursday. “Their convergence will create a new era of biology, one that is expected to yield a deep understanding of biological processes, with the ultimate aim of improving human health through more powerful disease prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.” Experts say the initiative sets a precedent for building more research centers that mix the two disciplines. “There is a huge need in the biology field to bring in computational and data science expertise,” said Peng Qiu, a professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology who studies the subject, adding, the need for integrating the two fields “has been well recognized in the research community.” The endowment gift is the largest donation the couple has given through Schmidt Futures, their latest philanthropic initiative focusing on science and technology. The Schmidts have other philanthropic arms, including their family foundation, and are ranked as one of the top donors in the United States. The institute said Thursday that it also received an additional $150 million contribution from the Broad Foundation, the charity founded by philanthropists Eli and Edythe L Broad. The couple helped create the institute in 2003, and their foundation has pledged more than $1 billion to the research facility. “Much like Eli and Edye Broad saw the potential in creating the Broad Institute, Wendy and I believe this center has the promise to create a new field of science that could benefit human health in ways we can't even begin to imagine,” Eric Schmidt, a member of the institute's board, said in the announcement. “The pandemic has shown us that prioritizing science, innovation, and research is one of the greatest investments we can make in our future,” he added. The center, which will be named after the Schmidts, will collaborate with experts from numerous fields at companies ranging from Google, Microsoft and AstraZeneca, and learning institutions including Oxford University and the Mayo Clinic. “Philanthropic gifts of this magnitude have the potential to be transformative in scientific discovery," said R Patrick Bixler, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin's RGK Center for Philanthropy and Community Service. He notes doing this work "through a network of cross-sector partners will undoubtedly lead to breakthroughs in internal medicine and public health." Schmidt served as Google's CEO from 2001 to 2011, a time of rapid growth for the California-based technology company. He later became executive chairman for Google, and in 2015, for its new parent company, Alphabet, before resigning as chairman in 2018.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/former-google-ceo-gives-150-million-for-research-in-biology-ai/articleshow/81695098.cms||---
---||India||Stability, security of Indo-Pacific absolutely critical for prosperity of the world: Korean defence minister||South Korean defence minister Suh Wook is in India to bolster bilateral defence cooperation, soon after US secretary of defence Lloyd Austin's visit to expand cooperation in the Indo-Pacific against a belligerent China. He tells Rajat Pandit that Korea and India can look to jointly produce and export weapon systems to third countries. Excerpts:Q: What is the purpose of your visit to India?A: Since establishing a special strategic partnership in 2015, Korea and India have developed into partners that cooperate closely not only bilaterally but as well as multilaterally. I look forward to strengthening our special partnership. On Friday morning, I will attend the opening ceremony of the India-Korea Friendship Park (in Delhi Cantonment). This park will be a new milestone in celebrating the eternal friendship of our countries and paying respect to the commitment and sacrifice of Indian veterans in the Korean War, who provided medical assistance and saved many lives. I will then meet defence minister Rajnath Singh to discuss ways to strengthen our defence cooperation. I will also visit the 50 Para Brigade and 60 Para Hospital in Agra to convey my thanks to the heroes of the Korean War. Q: What can India and Korea do to increase security in the Indo-Pacific?A: The Indo-Pacific constitutes 60% of the world's population and is also a dynamic region through which 47% of world trade transits. Stability and security of the Indo-Pacific is absolutely critical for prosperity of the entire world. In the recent past, natural disasters, maritime accidents and crimes have increased in the region, apart from the advent of transnational threats such as Covid-19. There is an increasing trend of regional states pushing policies that put their nations first. In times like these, the international community must show solidarity and cooperation. From this perspective, I believe the importance of India-Korea cooperation cannot be stressed enough. We share the same values of free democracies and market economics. I believe we can become partners in pursuing and driving equitable distribution of Covid-19 vaccines as well as in ensuring freedom of navigation and overflight in the region. Q: What are the specific plans for cooperation in the defence sector?A: The Korean government is endeavouring to bolster strategic cooperation with South Asian countries, with our new 'Southern Policy'. India is a critical partner in this. Our defence ministry is planning a diverse range of cooperation with India. For instance, sharing expertise in areas like counter-terrorism, cybersecurity and space cooperation. In 2020, Korea and India agreed a roadmap between their defence industries, which proposes substantial cooperation through joint R&D, technology transfers, co-production and marketing. This is in line with your government's 'Make in India' policy. Recently, L&T (in collaboration with South Korean Hanwha Defence) delivered the 100th K-9 Vajra self-propelled howitzer to the Indian Army. It's a textbook example of Korean technology transfer with local production. We look forward to expanding the scope to other areas like aircraft and ships. We can jointly export to third countries, with India being the gateway between Asia and the Middle East and Africa. We are very proud of Korea's ship-building capabilities that have a competitive edge in the world. Korea produces logistics support vessels, corvettes, frigates and submarines. We have exported them to various countries. Korean firms can fulfil all conditions, from design to production, in India's minesweeper and submarine-building projects. Q: As a neighbour, what is your opinion about the rise of China and its belligerence in the Indo-Pacific?A: Through history, the political situation on the Korean Peninsula has been stable when the neighbouring countries have maintained peaceful and co-existing relations. Our government is maintaining stable, friendly and cooperative relations with our neighbours as well as with allies like the US. It is appropriate that we contribute to the resolution of all friction through dialogue and communication. In the process of driving forward the de-nuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula and the overall peace process, China can certainly play a constructive role. Our government's position is that the rules-based order must be maintained in the Indo-Pacific. Openness, inclusiveness and transparency must be the principles for regional cooperation. Korea and India share these fundamental principles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/stability-security-of-indo-pacific-absolutely-critical-for-prosperity-of-the-world-korean-defence-minister/articleshow/81695426.cms||Rajat Pandit

This has been the longest gap between my parties. I just invited a few close friends and arranged it as a sit-down dinner so that everyone can just chat and spend a good time. I really wanted to host my friends at my home before it is already the peak of summer in Delhi,” said Bhaichand. Renuka Varma and Pavan K VarmaNalini SinghAruna VasudevFarewell note: In his farewell speech, the Turkish Ambassador said that it is difficult for him and his wife to leave the country they have been in love with. “Both my wife and I wanted to visit India in 1992. It was a dream destination for us, but we couldn’t visit it then, but god had better plans. Some years later I came here as a diplomat and not only got a chance to visit some beautiful places here but have made friends for a lifetime. I will surely return to India for a holiday and I look forward to visiting all the places that I could not during my tenure here,” said the ambassador.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bhaichand-patel-hosts-a-do-for-his-diplomat-friends-in-the-city/articleshow/81692330.cms||Divya Kaushik
---||India||PM and Shah will take a call on Assam CM: Himanta Biswa Sarma||Assam health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, BJP’s key strategist in the northeast, returned to his residence at 2 am after campaigning but was ready at 7 am. Scores of party workers gathered at Sarma’s bungalow in Guwahati while he spoke with Akhilesh Singh. Excerpts from the interview:Do you see Congress-AIUDF combine cornering seats as some of the new parties erode your Assamese vote base?A: AIUDF and Congress had contested Lok Sabha elections on 1:1 basis. People of Assam know AIUDF leader Badruddin Ajmal is not Assamese. He is an Indian, but not Assamese. You have to make a distinction. So in Assam, right from 1935, late Gopinath Bordoloi started fighting with Sir Sadullah. So, Muslim League vs Congress fight went on till 1982 under the aegis of Congress. This is a real battle in Assam, which we call civilisational conflict. When Indira Gandhi came, she changed the direction. So, the battle was fought by AASU and AGP from 1979 onwards. Now, it is BJP. So this civilisational fight, cultural conflict between ‘miyan’ (Bangla speaking Muslims) and Assamese are not in the least created by BJP. This is independent of what is going on, right wing and left wing in India. But where will this conflict end?A: They (miyan) have to change their mindset. Assamese people give birth to 2-3 children, they give birth to 12-14. As a result, we are losing our space. They have to change themselves. They go to madrasas. We go to normal schools. We cannot change, we cannot go to madrasas. They have to change. Now, Assamese is a language, one has to study it. You cannot create your own language. Ajmal is only a symbol. Sir Sadullah was it in 1935. Ghulam Usmani in 1979 and Ajmal today. BJP came to office in 2016 with Hindu Assamese voting overwhelmingly for it. What if Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP) and Raijor Dol chip away at that vote?A: The two are insignificant. They will never touch our traditional vote. In 2016, when Sarbananda Sonowal brought up regionalist people in the fold, people started thinking BJP is AGP and vice versa. BJP is a new version of AGP, this is what the people thought. But the LS elections and panchayat polls showed that these are two separate ideologies and ideas. You have been a crowd puller as one can see in your rallies. Some people see you as the most popular leader, a possible CM this time.A: It doesn’t matter. First of all, even if I am ambitious and Amit bhai (Amit Shah) says no, you will not become... then what can I do. I have been in politics for 20 years. I have learnt that where there is nothing to be gained, there’s no use spending energy. Whatever Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Amit bhai say, happens. Whatever they say, without question, I shall follow. If I could gain something by lobbying in pursuit of that ambition, I would do it (chuckles). They have my full record. So, for Assam, if they feel Himanta is the right man, they will give it to me. If they feel Sonowal is the right man, they will give it to him. You said this time also that you were not keen on fighting elections.A: I had said so in the beginning so that there is no confusion. But the high command said, you must fight. The CM and I share a great rapport. Whatever arrangements are made, there will be no tussle between him and me. Whatever perception outsiders have, the CM and I have a phone call every day at 7 am and begin our work only after that. We are on very friendly terms. Assam was one of the worst-hit states by the anti-CAA/NRC protests. However, it is not seen as a major issue in the polls. BJP is also silent on CAA during the campaign despite highlighting it in West Bengal.A: People don’t want to hear of it. See, this is human psychology. When Covid-19 hadn’t started, then it was CAA-NRC all the way. But when we were in lockdown and whatever publicity CAA had garnered, people felt new people are coming in from Bangladesh. People thought this Act is not intended to regularise those in our villages, but those who are coming from outside. So, we started explaining to people, the safety protocols for Covid-19 as well as the nuances of CAA. This is why most people don’t want to talk about CAA-NRC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-and-shah-will-take-a-call-on-assam-cm-himanta-biswa-sarma/articleshow/81695830.cms||Akhilesh Singh

---||India||'Chidambarams' investment grew from Rs 6.5cr to Rs 66cr'||NEW DELHI: In its chargesheet against former finance minister P Chidambaram, his son Karti, their chartered accountant S Bhaskararaman and others, the Enforcement Directorate has listed details of their investments that “multiplied” from Rs 6.5 crore allegedly received as gratification from INX Media, to Rs 65.9 crore in a matter of months. A special court in Delhi took cognisance of the chargesheet on Wednesday, prima facie agreeing with the agency’s findings. Chidambaram and his son have been asked to be present in court on April 7 when charges will be framed. Chidambaram once again denied the ED's charges, and said the summons were a routine court process. “INX Media Pvt Ltd had made payments of Rs 6.5 crore, detected till date, to several shell companies of Karti P Chidambaram in India and outside India. The first illegal gratification of Rs 3 crore was made through Span Fibre and Satyam Fibre to ASCPL, Kriya and CBNPMC, the companies beneficially owned by Karti as part of P Chidambaram’s direction,” the chargesheet claimed. The payments from INX Media were made during 2007-08. Out of the first instalment of the “illegal gratification”, Advantage Strategic Consulting Pvt Limited (ASCPL), allegedly controlled by Karti, invested Rs 1.5 crore in purchasing 1.5 lakh shares of Vasan Health Care. Later, ASCPL sold 30,000 shares of Vasan Health Care to Sequoia (SCI-GIH) for Rs 22.2 crore, while another 36,245 shares were sold to Vasan Medical Hall for Rs 18.6 crore, the ED claimed. Income from the two sales stood at Rs 40.8 crore. With more funds in its kitty, ASCPL bought shares of AGS Health Care for Rs 11 crore. These were sold for Rs 29.4 crore, generating a profit of Rs 18.4 crore, the ED claimed. Most of these transactions happened in a span of two years. Together with the accrued income and two other instalments of “illegal gratification” from INX Media, the “proceeds of crime” of Karticontrolled shell firms reached Rs 65.9 crore, the ED claimed. The chargesheet claimed that these proceeds were laundered by “investing in properties outside India” through a subsidiary, ASCSPL, raised in Singapore. With the proceeds of crime, the accused purchased Surridge Farm in London and Gava Club in Spain, the ED said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/chidambarams-investment-grew-from-rs-6-5cr-to-rs-66cr/articleshow/81695979.cms||Pradeep Thakur
---||India||Firmly opposed to Quad alliance: China||BEIJING: China said on Thursday that it was firmly opposed to the Quad alliance consisting of the US, India, Australia and Japan as it asked Washington to refrain from making "troubles out of nothing" and do more to contribute to regional peace and stability. Senior Colonel Ren Guoqiang, a spokesperson for China's ministry of national defence, made the remarks at an online media briefing when asked about the recent Quad summit and reported statement by US national security advisor Jake Sullivan stating that Quad leaders discussed the "challenges" posed by China and they had no illusions about it. US President Biden, who hosted the First Quad Leaders' Summit, told leaders of the coalition that a "free and open" Indo-Pacific is essential to their countries and that his country was committed to working with its partners and allies in the region to achieve stability. China firmly opposed the "four-side mechanism" promoted by the US as it adheres to the Cold War mentality, Ren said. He said that the Quad mechanism believes in group confrontation, is keen on geopolitical games, and uses the so-called "China challenge" as an excuse to "form cliques" and openly provoke relations between regional countries. "We are firmly opposed to this," he added. "China is committed to building world peace, contributing to global development and upholding the international order. We urge the US to shoulder its responsibilities, refrain from making troubles out of nothing and do more for regional peace and stability," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/firmly-opposed-to-quad-alliance-china/articleshow/81696425.cms||---

Also, from the official ammunition he was allotted, only five of the 30 bullets were recovered from his residence; the rest were missing, said additional solicitor general Anil Singh, while seeking an extension of his custody. Waze, in his defence, said he had nothing to do with the crime and had been made a scapegoat. Special judge Prashant R Sitre sent Waze to the NIA custody till April 3. Singh submitted that since a police officer has to account for each and every bullet he is assigned, the NIA wanted to ascertain for what purpose the remaining 25 bullets were used and what patronage he had that allowed them to not maintain a record. “Why huge amount of bullets were kept in his house? Is this a deep-rooted conspiracy?” Singh asked. The NIA also submitted that during investigation, it found that Waze had paid Rs 12 lakh for 100 days for a suite at the Oberoi hotel. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh said that Waze had used a fake Aadhaar card with his picture and pseudonym for booking a suite at the Oberoi hotel. Waze was arrested on March 13 in connection with the probe into the recovery of explosives from an SUV found parked near businessman Mukesh Ambani’s south Mumbai residence on February 25. On March 14, he was remanded to NIA custody for 12 days. “We are concerned with the safety of the people,” Singh said. He added that the NIA wanted to investigate the purpose of the act and if it was done to disturb the economy of the country by targeting a businessman or for the purpose of creating terror in the society. Singh said that investigations were at a crucial stage. “This is one of the most heinous and most shocking cases not only in our city or state but the entire country. Everybody is shocked to find that a police officer is involved in planting explosives at a particular place of a case he himself was the investigating officer of,” he said. Waze was produced for his remand hearing before the special NIA court at 2.45pm. Earlier, the NIA had added sections under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) against Waze and also taken over the probe in the Mansukh Hiran murder case. The NIA said that since the provisions of UAPA are attracted, a total custody of 30 days could be sought. Referring to the murder, Singh submitted, “The murder is connected to this crime and needs to be investigated. Explosive-laden vehicle was in his name. Two persons have been taken into custody from the ATS.” He said that Waze’s further custody was also required to confront him with those accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/62-unaccounted-bullets-found-with-waze-nia/articleshow/81696804.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||---||'Can create 4 more Pakistans': TMC neta's remark creates a row||KOLKATA: A video purportedly showing a Trinamool functionary talking about creating "four Pakistans" during a rally in Bengal's Birbhum led BJP to fire yet another salvo on Thursday at CM Mamata Banerjee's "appeasement politics". In the video tweeted by BJP's Amit Malviya, who is the party's Bengal co-incharge, Trinamool member Alam Sheikh tells a gathering at Basapara on Wednesday, "If we can put the 30% together, four Pakistans can be created out of that. If we club these 30% people, where will the 70% go?" Malviya questioned, "Does she (Mamata) endorse this position? Do we want a Bengal like that?" BJP also highlighted an alleged four-letter word used by CM Mamata at Patharpratima in South 24-Parganas to slam her for "lowering the political discourse". The party might bring this to the EC's notice, BJP spokesperson Shishir Bajoria said. "Bengal, which boasts of Vidyasagar, Rabindranath and Swami Vivekananda, is not habituated to hearing such words. Coming from a CM, this is shameful." Anubrata Mandal, Trinamool's Birbhum district president, said Sheikh's "communal statement" didn't reflect the party's view. "He is not a party portfolio-holder. I don't know who said it. I have not seen the content. But I will look into his exact speech." Sheikh later apologised, although it wasn't immediately known if the party had forced him to do it. BJP's attacks came on a day Trinamool took repeated swipes at the BJP state president Dilip Ghosh for his statement that Mamata "should have worn Bermudas instead of a sari if she wanted to show off her (injured) leg"||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/west-bengal/can-create-4-more-paks-tmc-netas-remark-creates-a-row/articleshow/81696972.cms||---
---||World||Biden says China won't surpass US as global leader on his watch||WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden on Thursday said he would prevent China from passing the United States to become the most powerful country in the world, vowing to invest heavily to ensure America prevails in the race between the world's two largest economies. Biden said he had spent "hours upon hours" with Xi Jinping when he served as vice president under former President Barack Obama, and was convinced the Chinese president believed autocracy - not democracy - held the key to the future. The Democratic president said he had made it clear to Xi that the United States was not looking for confrontation, but would insist that China abide by international rules for fair competition and fair trade and respect for human rights. "China has an overall goal ... to become the leading country in the world, the wealthiest country in the world, and the most powerful country in the world," he told reporters at the White House. "That's not going to happen on my watch because the United States is going to continue to grow." Biden took aim at Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin for embracing autocracy. "He's one of the guys, like Putin, who thinks that autocracy is the wave of the future, (and) democracy can't function in an ever-complex world," the president told his first news conference since taking office in January. Earlier in March, Biden told ABC News he believed Putin was "a killer," which sparked fury in Moscow. "He (Xi) doesn't have a democratic - with a small 'd' - bone in his body, but he's a smart, smart guy," he said. Biden's remarks echoed those made during his presidential campaign, and come days after the first high-level, in-person talks between US and Chinese officials under his administration in Alaska, where combative public statements laid bare the depth of tensions between the rivals. Biden said he would work with US allies to hold China accountable for its actions on Taiwan, Hong Kong, the South China Sea, and its treatment of the Uighur minority, as well as push Beijing to stick to international rules for fair trade. He said he told Xi during a two-hour conversation after taking office: "As long as you and your country continue to so blatantly violate human rights, we are going to continue in an unrelenting way to call it to the attention of the world, and make it clear, make it clear, what's happening. And he understood that." Failing to do so, as happened under former President Donald Trump, would undermine America's credibility, Biden said. "The moment a president walks away from that, as the last one did, is the moment we begin to lose our legitimacy around the world. It's who we are," he said. Biden, who plans to unveil a multi-trillion-dollar infrastructure proposal next week, said he would ensure increased US investment in promising new technologies, such as quantum computing, artificial intelligence and biotechnology. He said he aimed to return US investment in research and technology development closer to the 2% of GDP invested in the 1960s from the current rate of about 0.7%. "The future lies in who can, in fact, own the future as it relates to technology, quantum computing, a whole range of things, including in the medical fields,” he said.

Meanwhile, India recorded 59,117 fresh cases on Thursday, the highest single-day count in the country in 159 days, with Maharashtra hitting another all-time high of 35,952 new infections in a single day. The day's death toll in India was 255, above 250 for the second time in the last three days. Active cases in the country have increased by over 52,000 in the past two days alone, including a single-day highest-ever rise of over 26,400 on Wednesday. The fastest increase of 1 lakh cases before this was the rise from 9 lakh active cases to 10 lakh in six days during the peak of the pandemic in mid-September last year. India is in the midst of its sharpest-ever growth in cases of the coronavirus. In the last 15 days, the seven-day rolling average of daily cases has risen 2.6-fold, from 18,379 on March 10 to 47,439 on March 25. The corresponding increase during the first wave of the pandemic took nearly double the time — 28 days for the average to rise from 18,280 on June 29 last year to 46,760 on July 27, as per TOI’s Covid-19 database. The good news is that during the corresponding period last year, India was recording far more deaths than at present. Daily deaths had remained higher than 400 during the 28-day period while touching a high of 608. By contrast, the death toll hit a high of 276 on Tuesday. However, fatalities have been on the rise since the surge in cases began. India’s case count of 59,078 was the highest daily number in more than five months since October 17 and a sharp rise from Wednesday's tally of 53,395. The surge was mainly on account of Maharashtra, where daily cases grew from 31,855 on the previous day to 35,952. Mumbai too continued to breach previous records of highest daily detections, reporting 5,505 new cases on Thursday, the highest so far. The state also recorded 111 deaths. Cases were rising sharply in other states as well. Apart from Maharashtra, at least 17 states posted their highest daily case on Thursday since January or earlier. That included Gujarat, which logged 1,961 new infections, its highest count ever. This was the fourth time in as many days that Gujarat had reported a new high in cases. Punjab recorded 2,700 cases, the highest since September 18. As many as 14 states/UTs reported their highest single-day surge this year. Karnataka added 2,523 fresh cases, the highest since November 11, while Chhattisgarh’s tally soared to 2,419, the most since October 23. Other states that witnessed a big spike on Thursday included Madhya Pradesh (1,885 cases, highest since October 14), Tamil Nadu (1,779, highest since November 15), Delhi (1,515, highest since December 16), Haryana (1,053, highest since December 11).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/active-covid-cases-cross-4-lakh-fastest-1l-rise-ever/articleshow/81697562.cms||Amit Bhattacharya

It also replaced Superintendents of Police (SP) of Diamond Harbour and Cooch Behar as well as the district election officer of Jhargram. Sources said the transfers were based on reports of EC special observers Ajay Nayak and Vivek Dube, who had in fact recommended the transfer of more than a dozen officers in view of their ‘partisan conduct’ in favour of the ruling TMC. EC, after considering their report, immediately approved the transfer of 5 officers, even as it shall keep a watch on the remaining officers. In Tamil Nadu, EC transferred IGP, Coimbatore. Also, collector and SP of Tiruchirappalli as well as sub-collector of Srirangam were shifted out for “fudging” the report and misrepresenting facts relating to the seizure of Rs 1 crore in the district on Wednesday, said a source. In a sharp reaction to the transfers in West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee, said, “BJP, with the EC, is now playing a game of officer transfers after realising that it has lost the match. The EC should introspect whether it should do everything that BJP asks for. We too are a political party just like BJP.” She said, “We are slogging in rallies, bearing all the pain, people are braving the intense heat but BJP is meddling so much in EC functions that it is now looking like the BJP Commission. But I want to tell them, transfer everybody, change everything but you cannot ensure a BJP win. Officers do not vote. You may issue showcause notices to me for saying this. I will fight unafraid. I will admit that I have erred the day people rebuke me.” All the five officers replaced in West Bengal – ADG West Zone Sanjay Singh, DCP South Kolkata Sudhir Neelkantha, SP Diamond Harbour Avijit Banerjee, SP Cooch Behar K Kannan and DEO Jhargram Ayesha Rani -- shall not be posted in any election-related posts till completion of the polls, ordered EC. While Rajesh Kumar will be the new ADG West Zone, Akash Magharia has been posted as DCP Kolkata, Arijit Sinha as SP Diamond Harbour, Debashish Dhar as SP Cooch Behar and Joyeshi Dasgupta as DEO of Jhargram. EC directed Ayesha Rani to be attached to the office of the state chief secretary till completion of polls The SP of Cooch Behar was transferred after BJP mandal president Amit Sarkar was found hanging in Dinhata, North Bengal, on Wednesday. BJP had alleged that he was picked up from his residence by TMC cadres, before being found dead mysteriously. BJP social media in-charge Amit Malviya had reacted saying that Bengal has been reduced to a blood field, with political killings becoming the norm. In Tamil Nadu, EC transferred IGP/Commissioner of Police, Coimbatore Sumit Sharan and posted S Davidson Devasirvatham in his place by upgrading the post to ADG/Commissioner of Police. Sharan will go to Chennai as IGP, Welfare. Also cracking down on the district authorities after the seizure of Rs 1 crore in Tiruchirappalli, EC transferred collector S Sivarasu and SP P Rajan to non-election related post; and replaced them with S Divyadharshini and A Myilvaganan respectively. Even the sub-collector of Sringangam, Tiruchirappalli was replaced.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/west-bengal/ec-shifts-5-officers-on-poll-eve-mamata-calls-it-frantic-move/articleshow/81697819.cms||Bharti Jain

Anticipating further rise in number of Covid patients in the days to come, city hospitals have stepped up efforts to ensure availability of beds, healthcare staff and required medical equipment. The number of active Covid cases in the state has crossed 900-mark from 400 about a week back. Doctors said new Covid patientsare showing different symptoms. “Apart from fever, cold and respiratory problems, the patients are coming with atypical symptoms like eye redness, nausea, diarrhoea, delirium and rashes in body,” said Dr Sanjeev Kumar, nodal officer for Covid-19 at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna (AIIMS-P). “Many patients in the Covid ward are showing unusual symptoms like diarrhoea, weakness, intraocular pressure and loss of appetite. However, we cannot confirm whether it is the new strain of Covid or not. The doctors are using the same medicines during the treatment,” Dr Sanjeev said. The AIIMS-P has witnessed 135% rise in number of Covid patients in the last six days. “The number has risen from 17 to 40. The Covid ward of the hospital has the capacity to accommodate only 40 patients. Hence, new patients will be admitted only after the old ones are discharged,” said a hospital official. Dr Vidyapati Choudhary of Patna Medical College and Hospital said the number of Covid patients has risen by 4-5% in the last one week. “At PMCH, we can accommodate up to 40 patients at a time,” he said. Meanwhile, seven Covid patients were undergoing treatment at Paras HMRI Hospital on Thursday. Paras HMRI regional director (east) Dr Talat Halim too said diarrhoea, an atypical symptom, was seen in one Covid patient.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/gradual-rise-in-number-of-covid-patients-at-hospitals/articleshow/81694946.cms||Faryal Rumi

The board has also imposed a fine of Rs 25,000 each if they fail to respond within the next 15 days. The NGT, in its order in December 2016, had prohibited the burning of waste in open places and had set a fine of Rs 25,000 for each incident of bulk burning of waste, including at landfill sites, and Rs 5,000 on anyone caught burning waste. Acting on complaints, an inspection team of the pollution board visited the PMC's landfill site at Ramachak Bariya on Patna-Gaya Road on March 20 and found a massive fire billowing thick toxic smoke from the burning garbage for a week. The fire was extinguished on March 23. A senior officer of the board, Nalini Mohan Singh, who inspected the site has ruled out the cause of the fire due to the emission of methane gas from unsegregated waste at the landfill site. As per his analysis, typically within less than 1 year, anaerobic conditions are established and methane-producing bacteria begin to decompose the waste and generate methane. However, the burned waste was not old. The inspection team visited IGIMS-P on March 3 after the pollution board's public relations officer Birendra Kumar had caught a few people burning bulk waste inside the campus. “The hospital administration burned leaves, plastic waste and other materials regularly. Following the NGT order, the notices have been issued to the PMC’s municipal commissioner and the director of IGIMS-P,” Kumar told this newspaper on Thursday. “Proposal direction for imposing a penalty of environmental compensation of Rs 25,000 on PMC and IGIMS-P in the light of the order of the NGT, principal bench, New Delhi, and Section 31 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981,” says a part of the notice issued. Municipal commissioner Himanshu Sharma said some mischief rag-pickers might have burned tyres to pick up iron scraps from the landfill site, which might have caused the fire. “We will submit the reply to the BSPCB and to ensure that such an incident will not happen again, the PMC will install CCTV cameras and monitor the activities of rag-pickers,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/waste-burning-pmc-igims-get-pollution-board-notice/articleshow/81695394.cms||Faryal Rumi

Yadav told TOI, “The inquiry has started and the statements of the nuns, girls and RPF and GRP personnel are being recorded. I am contacting the women on phone.” There is no need to contact the ABVP leader who had lodged the complaint since his written complaint will be treated as his statement, he added. Last Friday, two nuns Livia Thomas and Hemlata were travelling with two girls Shweta and Bitrang to Rourkela in B2 compartment of Utkal Express from Delhi. ABVP leader Ajay Shankar Tiwari travelling in the next compartment saw the nun and the girls and said he overheard them talking about conversion. Tiwari flashed the message to Jhansi GRP. On reaching Jhansi, all the four passengers were deboarded and interrogated for around three hours at GRP station on the basis of written complaint of Tiwari. The complaint was found baseless as it was established that all of them were Christians since birth and they were allowed to leave. On Tuesday, Christian community from Kerala complained to the PMO and Kerala CM wrote a letter to Shah seeking action for harassment of the women. Speaking at an election rally in Bengal, Shah assured a free and fair investigation of the incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/sp-grp-begins-inquiry-into-deboarding-of-nuns-in-jhansi/articleshow/81694463.cms||---

As per the details of the case, the victim Sujansinh Parmar and his friend Bhagirath Hadiyal were attacked with swords, knife and iron pipe near Bhagwati Circle in Bhavnagar on the night of January 19, 2019. While Parmar died, Hadiyal survived with severe injuries. Two of the convicts — Jaideep Sinh Jadeja and Jaideep Sinh Sarvaiya — had developed a rift with Parmar around three months before the murder. On New Years’ Eve in 2018 too, Parmar had an encounter with Jadeja and Sarvaiya during which they had an argument. After being threatened, Parmar had lodged a complaint with the police. As Parmar had approached police, the accused duo was angry. They decided to bump him off and devised a plan along with other convicts. The group attacked Parmar and Hadiyal when they were hanging out near Bhagwati Circle. Later in Hadiyal’s complaint, along with Jadeja and Sarvaiya, names of other attackers — Jaideep Parmar, Konark Solanki, Harvijaysinh Chudasama, Harsh Dodiya, Mohit Makwana and Indrajitsinh Gohil — were revealed. Police had arrested them for murder, attempt to murder, rioting and criminal conspiracy.During the trial, the evidence submitted by district government pleader Vipul Devmurari and the depositions of witnesses and material witnesses were upheld by the court of principal district judge R T Vachhani.

---||Lucknow||Yogi storms Didi turf, says she betrayed Nandigram||Lucknow: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday stormed West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s backyard — Nandigram — and mounted a blistering attack on the TMC chief, accusing her of firing from shoulders of Nandigram violence victims to dislodge the Left government, but failing to deliver on the promise of development. “The Trinamool Congress boss is only concerned about infiltrators and won’t ban cow slaughter for the sake of a particular vote-bank,” he told a huge gathering at Nandigram, the political epicentre that catapulted Mamata to power a decade ago with the slogan — Ma Mati Manush — at the peak of the agitation against the Left government’s special economic zone project. At least 14 people had died in police firing. Yogi, who also addressed rallies at Sagar and Chandrakona assembly seats, accused the Bengal CM of banning the slogan ‘Jai Sri Ram’. “Lord Ram is a symbol of ‘maryada’ (dignity), sanskriti (culture) and ‘samprabhuta’ (sovereignty). Mamata needs to understand BJP has always come to power whenever the Opposition tries to muzzle the chant of Jai Sri Ram,” he said, terming the upcoming Ram temple in Ayodhya as a ‘Rashtra Mandir’. BJP’s saffron mascot also took a swipe at the Trinamool president, saying she was, in fact, scared of ‘bhagwa’ (saffron colour). Didi should know that saffron is the symbol of bhartiya sanskriti (Indian culture), he said. “Yahi bhagwa tha jisey lekar Chaitanya Mahaprabhu ne bhakti ke geet gaa ke …gali gali mein ja ke … Bengal ko bachane ka kaam kiye tha (Chaitanya Mahaprabhu wore saffron to secure Bengal through his Bhakti songs),” he said. “It was the same saffron which was worn by Swami Vivekanand who gave the slogan of ‘garv se kaho ki hum Hindu hain’ (Feel proud to be a Hindu) from an international platform,” he said, pointing out that even the Tricolor had saffron at the top. “Aur ashtami mein Ma Kali ko bhi hum yahin bhagwa arpit karte hain (People offer saffron to Kali during ashtami),” he said, adding the sky bathes in saffron when the sun rises. Yogi also accused the ruling party of running an ‘industry’ of corruption and unleashing its goons to spread anarchy in the state. He said TMC goons would face the law when BJP comes to power in the next few days. “35 din ke baad TMC ke goondon ki ulti ginti chalu ho jayegi …kyun ki tab BJP ki sarkar hogi aur in sabki goondon ko dhoond dhoond kar ke kanoon ke shikanje mein dalne ka karya kiya jayega… (The days of TMC goons are numbered. The BJP government would get each of them punished by law),” he reiterated, while citing the recent murder of a BJP worker. Blaming TMC for rising employment and slack industrial growth in the state, he said Mamata's party had legitimised ‘tolabaazi’ to usurp public funds. He alleged the relief fund of Rs 1000 crore released by the Narendra Modi government for cyclone-hit parts of Bengal last year was also “looted” by TMC goons. “Didi has no interest in the development or welfare of Bengal. She is into bhai bhatijawaad,” he said, in an apparent reference to Mamata’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee, whose wife Rujira faces a CBI probe over illegal mining. “Bengal was once the most prosperous state with the highest per capita income. But see what Congress, Communist and TMC has done to the state,” he said, slamming Mamata Banerjee for pursuing politics of communal appeasement to divide society. He cited the ban imposed on Durga Puja, which coincided with Moharram two years ago. Yogi said, Bengal too needs a “double engine” government with BJP both at the Centre and the state. “It will ensure welfare schemes for people of all communities,” he said. CM also highlighted achievements of his government in UP, saying more than 40 lakh houses were constructed under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, over 6 crore people have got benefits. more than 2.42 crore farmers received Kisan Samman Nidhi in four years and over 2.62 crore toilets have been constructed in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/yogi-storms-didi-turf-says-she-betrayed-nandigram/articleshow/81696511.cms||Pankaj Shah

Every company which uses accounting software shall use only such systems that possess a feature of recording audit trail for transactions and are able to create logs of changes made to the books of account and “ensuring that the audit trail cannot be disabled”, an MCA notification on Wednesday said. While this helps mitigate unrecorded transactions and curb frauds, it is a huge compliance burden on companies to implement new systems and retrain staff, companies and auditors told TOI.There should be a turnover limit instead of a blanket rule, they added, arguing that the move will impact smaller companies. Government sources, however, dismissed the complaint, saying the move was necessary to check frauds as there were several instances of fudging of books. “The move will largely impact small and medium sized enterprises. Even in the case of larger companies, in many cases, transactions are initially captured in peripheral systems, and data is then used for recording accounting entries in the core ERPs. Such companies too need to take steps to comply with the new rule,” Sai Venkateshwaran, partner, KPMG India, said.Prashant Ganti, head of tax, accounting and payroll products at Zoho, said while the ideal expectation is for companies to have such a software, it is a big task for those who don’t. “We have been evangelising this for a long time,” he said. Zoho Books, Zoho’s financial software, has the audit trail feature, he added.However, some of the most widely used financial ERPs that don’t have audit trails or have a provision to disable them, stare at an uncertain future. Social media was abuzz with queries from users of such systems on Thursday. Tally Solutions, with a customer base of two million and largest market share of around 75% in this segment, has an audit trail function but currently there is also a provision where users can disable it. “This is likely to create huge friction in ease of doing business come April 1. We are working to figure out how to help our customers and efforts to save the company come second,” Bharat Goenka, vice chairman, Tally Solutions, told TOI. “While we currently have the audit trail capability, we are seeking clarifications from the ministry to ensure we advise our customers in the right manner,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/audit-trail-must-in-accounting-software-from-april/articleshow/81695614.cms||Sindhu Hariharan
---||Chandigarh||Tikait: Farmers in no hurry to talk to Centre||Karnal: Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) spokesperson Rakesh Tikait on Thursday said farmers are not in a hurry for talks with the government, as they have become used to staying at Delhi borders, come rain or shine. Tikait was addressing a “kisan mahapanchayat” at Assandh grain market in Karnal district. The mahapanchayat turnout was in thousands. Tikait said, “If the government has no time to talk with farmers, then farmers are also not in a hurry. This agitation will continue so long. Our panch and manch will remain the same and 2021 is the movement year. We will install fans, coolers and ACs in our camps.” According to him, the government wants to destroy the mandi system while imposing anti-farmer laws, but the farmers have identified their mandis. They will sell their produce outside the state assemblies, DC, and SDM offices, as no grain market can be better than the government institutions. “The government should not think that farmers will return home to harvest their crop. But I want to clear that we will also harvest the crop and the agitation will also continue until the government withdraws these laws,” Tikait added. He said efforts were made by the government to break the unity of Punjab and Haryana, but the farmers foiled their attempts. Tikait called for unity and cooperation across all sections of society to take on the government. Other leaders, including Gurnam Singh Charuni, Balbir Singh Rajewal, and Yudhvir Singh, also attended the mahapanchayat. They reiterated their demand for the repeal of the farm laws. They asked the protesters to be ready for a long battle. Charuni said the agitation has become a “jan andolan” (mass movement) as every section of society now stands with farmers. He said they will not allow the MLAs who voted against the no-confidence motion in the assembly to enter the village but teach them a lesson in the future elections. He also accused the government of harassing the MLAs and other people who support the farmers’ agitation. He urged the people to take part in the Bharat Bandh on March 26 with enthusiasm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/tikait-farmers-in-no-hurry-to-talk-to-centre/articleshow/81695756.cms||---

After the inauguration, the CM inspected the ongoing flyover and road construction sites in Mithapur, Karbigahiya and Mahuli. He asked the officials to complete the remaining works on Yarpur and Punpun arms of Mithapur railway overbridge (RoB) at the earliest. During the inspection of the flyovers under construction at Karbigahiya, the CM asked the officials to complete the work on Chiraiyatand arm of Karbigahiya flyover in one-and-a-half years. The Bihar Rajya Pul Nirmal Nigam Limited (BRPNNL) is constructing a flyover with three arms at Karbigahiya. Work on the Mithapur bus stand arm of the flyover is underway. While inspecting work on Mithapur-Mahuli four-lane elevated road, Nitish asked the officials to construct it over NH-30 bypass like AIIMS-Digha elevated road which passes through Bailey Road. The CM also issued instruction for construction of a RoB at Sipara railway crossing. He asked the officials to construct a ramp at Sipara for connecting the elevated road with areas on its east. At Parsa, Nitish asked the officials to provide connectivity of Parsa-Sampatchak road to the upcoming Mithapur-Mahuli elevated road. Also, consent was given for construction of another RoB at Parsa for people staying west of the railway line. Earlier, speaking at the inaugural event at R-Block flyover, Nitish said vehicles will now move smoothly from R-Block to Gandhi Maidan and Kankerbagh among other areas. The newly inaugurated arm of R-Block flyover allows the vehicles coming from airport via Hardinge Road to go directly to Gandhi Maidan or Kankarbagh through a network of flyovers and railway overbridges (RoBs) around Patna Junction. This is the third arm of R-Block flyover. The ramp of first arm of the flyover falls on Beerchand Patel Marg and the second arm connects to Bhikhari Thakur RoB, which goes to Mithapur. The first two arms of the flyover were inaugurated by Nitish in August last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nitish-inaugurates-3rd-arm-of-r-block-flyover/articleshow/81695378.cms||Piyush Tripathi

The SBI’s existing ethanol financing guidelines pertain to only the production of sugar and ethanol at sugar mills based on sugar cane, which are deemed to be viable among the bankers. However, the Centre has changed its policy with regard to ethanol production, opening the option for the production of fuel-grade ethanol from maize and broken rice to meet the high demand of this specific ethanol in the country for mixing with petrol, so as to cut the crude oil import cost. “We have asked the SBI CGM to take up the matter with their head office for new financing guidelines for the setting up of plants that produce fuel-grade ethanol based on maize and broken rice,” Hussain said, adding the bankers were “very positive and excited and assured to be pro-active with regard to the financing of such projects.” Hussain gave the instruction to the SBI top officials at a meeting held here on Thursday. Industries department additional chief secretary Brajesh Mehrotra, director (technical) Pankaj Dixit, SBI CGM and its other senior officials, along with representatives of potential investors, were present. The meeting had been convened to inform the SBI employees about the Centre’s new policy on fuel-grade ethanol production, as well as on the scope of setting up such plants in the state. “As many as 30 investors have already been listed and 10 others are on the line. The excitement level among them is palpable,” Hussain said. At the meeting, Mehrotra presented the scope of fuel-grade production, while investor representative of a company, Himanshu Taneja, made the presentation from the point of view of setting up a fuel-grade ethanol plant based on maize and broken rice. He also presented details on the process of commissioning of the plant, besides pointing to the profitability of the project, its break-even point and the pay-back period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ethanol-production-min-asks-sbi-to-change-financing-rules/articleshow/81694321.cms||Abhay Singh

Also, Prakash Ambedkar led Vanchit Bahujan Aaghadi (VBA) is planning to contest the election. SSS leader Sachin Patil filed his nomination paper on Wednesday, making the NCP a little anxious as the framers’ organization has considerable following in the area. SSS has currently taken an aggressive stand over the issue of power cut of farmers and payment to cane-growing farmers. Bharat Bhelke, whose death has caused by-election, was first elected as MLA as SSS candidate. NCP is yet to announce its candidate though Bhelke’s son Bhagirath has started campaigning. The party is also thinking of fielding Bhelke’s widow Jayshree as some have opposed Bhagirath’s nomination. BJP is closely watching the developments in NCP camp. Samadhan Autade, who has sought NCP nomination, is said to be in touch with BJP. BJP leaders have been talking to Prashan Paricharak, MLC, who enjoys clout in the constituency, to finalize consensus candidate. A few BJP leaders have demanded that former minister Ram Shinde, who lost last election from Ahmednagar, be fielded. Shinde belongs to dominant Dhangar community. Pandharpur- Mangalwedha constituency has a large number of Dalit voters. A group of Congress leaders is also pressing to contest the election.

The Sanyukta Kisan Morcha has called for shutting down railways, roadways and businesses for 12 hours, from 6am to 6pm and planned demonstrations across the country to force the central government to repeal the three new agri-marketing laws. The SKM has promised to let through ambulances and any vehicle taking students to their examinations. On the SKM’s call, a few states had joined another bandh on December 8, 2020. The morcha said the shutdown was for a law on MSP (minimum support price) and state procurement. It also asks for a withdrawal of all police cases against farmers, a rollback of the proposed electricity and air pollution bills, and cheaper fuels. Punjab’s farmer unions have marked the spots where they’ll stop buses and trains. Speakers are installed at some place to make appeals to the shopkeepers to lower their shutters and ask the private bus operators to stay off road. Punjab Kisan Union president Ruldu Singh Mansa said: “We have prepared hard for this bandh. We want to show Prime Minister Narendra Modi how much support we have and that there will be no retreat.” BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokri Kalan said the protests will be in 16 districts of Punjab and continue beyond Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/trader-unions-truckers-asked-to-support-bandh/articleshow/81695739.cms||---

Murthy also emphasised that the interest of the company must always come ahead of the interest of the individual and that, when in doubt, disclose it. These are some of the principles the IT services major has been following right from its inception. Kotak Mahindra Bank MD Uday Kotak said that founders may not be there, but their institutions remain, citing examples of renowned financial services brands like Merrill Lynch and JP Morgan. Entrepreneurs need to be thinking about transformative change, which requires some bets in the short run, for building a more sustainable future, Kotak said. Another panel member Biocon chairperson Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw said that women entrepreneurs face challenges in accessing capital as there is a perception that they are not risk-takers. Women need to have much more confidence in themselves and take big bets in the sector they operate in, Shaw said. Before the panel discussion, Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani, in his keynote address at the virtual award ceremony, said that startup entrepreneurs must be ready to work with limited resources but with unlimited determination, adding that they should not be deterred by failure, because only after many failures there is success. “Today, India is surging ahead as an economic power, as a democratic power, as a diplomatic and strategic power, as a cultural power and also a digital and technology power. And the key driving force for India’s rise will be our entrepreneurs, who are inventing new things every day that can transform India and the world, who are disruptive and hungry for success.” Marico chairman Harsh Mariwala won the EY EOY Award. He will now represent India at the EY World EOY Award on June 10. Mariwala transformed his family’s edible oil trading business into a consumer products major, Marico, whose several brands are household names in India. Apollo Hospitals founder Prathap Reddy was felicitated with the Lifetime Achievement Award. With no prior business experience, Reddy, a US-trained cardiologist, returned to India and built the country’s first corporate hospital in Chennai in 1983. Today, Apollo is among the largest healthcare institutions in Asia. Byju’s founder Byju Raveendran was conferred with the Business Transformation award, while Lenskart founder Peyush Bansal won the startup category award. Both used technology to disrupt the education and eyecare industries. Aavas Financiers MD Sushil Kumar Agarwal was conferred with the financial services category award while IndiaMart founder Dinesh Agarwal was the services category award winner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/entrepreneurs-must-use-data-facts-not-personal-biases/articleshow/81695610.cms||---

Former vice-chancellor of Patna University Rash Bihari Prasad Singh, who inaugurated the working model, praised the professionals of SKSC for their effort in making the sundial. He said the model would help people understand different aspects of sundial and inter-relation between the Earth and the Sun. Highlighting the main features of the sundial, SKSC’s project coordinator Amitabh said the present time can be seen on the lower part of the sundial and the pattern of illumination can be seen on the surface of the globe fixed on the upper part of sundial. “It means if a person stands in front of the sundial around 12 noon, he or she can see that India, Asia along with Africa continent will remain in full daylight while New Zealand, Pacific Ocean and North and South America under complete shadow,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/sundial-inaugurated-at-science-centre-in-patna/articleshow/81695409.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Business||Government to companies: Disclose crypto trades||CHENNAI: The government has ordered companies to disclose the details of investments and trades in cryptocurrency/virtual currency in financial statements. The move is part of the government’s efforts to assess the scale of such transactions and keep tabs on entities seeking to lure investors by promising high returns. The disclosures are mandated in the profit and loss statement, just like employee stock options or earning per share details. A notification issued by the ministry of corporate affairs (MCA) on Wednesday asked companies to provide details of cryptocurrency or virtual currency, such as profit or loss on transactions, amount of currency held on the reporting date and deposits or advances from any person for the purpose of trading or investing in cryptocurrency. A provision for this had already been made in Companies (Auditor’s Report) Order, 2020 following reports that several firms were getting investors to park funds in cryptocurrency. Crypto had been deemed illegal by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), until the Supreme Court stayed the order last year. The details have now been notified by the MCA, sources explained. “So far, the government was unable to get a fix on the scale of these transactions and the companies were not disclosing it. It will also help in investor protection,” said a government source. “Generally, companies who traded were called technology companies and such trades were primarily called goods or stocks trading. With this mandatory disclosure, this a positive step towards identifying cryto assets as a separate asset class,” said Indian blockchain lawyer Varun Sethi. It also demarcates the methods of accounting cryptocurrency by companies which are engaged in this trade. The disclosure will bring about greater transparency, Sethi added. On the other hand, cryptocurrency exchanges view it as a positive step from the regulators in identifying the number of Indian companies involved in cryptocurrency trade and the volume of exposure too. And believe this a major step towards regulating the crypto assets in India. The finance ministry and the RBI had earlier talked of banning cryptocurrency and central bank governor Shaktikanta Das expressed his reservations on Thursday as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/govt-to-companies-disclose-crypto-trades/articleshow/81695655.cms||Mamtha Asokan

---||Business||Rising Covid cases pull sensex down 740 points||TNN Mumbai: Rising Covid cases in India affected investor sentiment on Dalal Street on Thursday, leading to strong selling across sectors with the sensex closing 740 points, or 1.5%, lower at 48,440 points — a level not seen since the Budget on February 1. The day’s fall came on the back of a nearly Rs 3,400-crore net selling by foreign funds although domestic funds were net buyers at Rs 2,268 crore, BSE data showed. In the last two days, the sensex has lost a little over 1,611 points, or 3.2%, as India continues to see a strong spike in the number of new Covid infections. To slow down its rapid spread, the central government has now allowed local bodies to take decisions about lockdown and other measures. With investors fearing the spread of infections may again reverse the pace of the economic recovery, a large number of them are preferring to stay in cash, market players said. The situation is identical in most parts of the world due to the resurgence of the pandemic. According to Motilal Oswal Financial Services head (retail research) Siddhartha Khemka, the market may remain under pressure in the near term amid weak global cues and fast spreading of the Covid virus in India, which could impact the pace of economic recovery. High commodity prices too are a concern for the market and till it cools off substantially, the fear of inflation would continue to loom, Khemka said. This is expected to weigh on market sentiment. Expectation of rising inflation has also been driving up the yields in the bond market in India and abroad. In such a scenario, the rate of interest could also rise, negatively, impacting the already fragile economic growth. During the day’s session, of the 30 sensex stocks, 26 closed in the red. RIL accounted the most of the day’s slide in the sensex, followed by Infosys, HUL, HDFC Bank and TCS. Thursday’s session also made investors poorer by Rs 3.7 lakh crore with BSE’s market capitalisation now at Rs 200.6 lakh crore. With Wall Street showing weakness in early trades on Thursday, market players remained cautious about Friday’s trade on Dalal Street.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rising-covid-cases-pull-sensex-down-740-points/articleshow/81695782.cms||---
---||Business||Sebi asks 500 more companies to detail dividend norms||MUMBAI: In a move to strengthen corporate governance, markets regulator Sebi on Thursday extended the dividend distribution norm to 1,000 companies from 500 even as it eased guidelines for listing of startups. Under the dividend distribution policy, a company must disclose in advance the numbers and circumstances under which it would pay dividend to its investors and adhere to them. In its board meeting, the regulator took a slew of decisions, including asking companies to detail their Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report relating to preservation of environment. The regulator relaxed rules relating to delisting and de-classification of promoters. It made it mandatory for companies to make analyst call recordings public in 24 hours, allowed listed entities to change name without any prior nod from bourses and asked companies to disclose shareholding pattern within 21 days from the end of quarter. Sebi made ‘Innovator Growth Platform’, a special segment on the bourses on which only startups could be listed, more accessible to companies and said portfolio managers should take prior approval of the regulator before change of control. While changing various provisions of Sebi’s Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements Regulations (LODR), the regulator said that if the board meeting of a company continues for more than a day, “the financial results shall be disclosed by listed entities within 30 minutes of end of the board meeting for the day on which the financial results are considered”. It said that companies will not have to publish newspaper advertisements for board meetings “where financial results are to be discussed and for quarterly statement on deviation or variation in use of funds”. It also said that timelines for submission of periodic reports on investor complaints, corporate governance and shareholding pattern should be published within 21 days from the end of each quarter, from one month now. The Sebi board approved several other changes to the LODR regulations “to strengthen these corporate governance practices,” it said in a press release. These changes are aimed at “ensuring gender neutrality and maintaining consistency within the LODR Regulations, harmonising certain provisions of the LODR Regulations with Companies Act, in addition to strengthening the corporate governance practices and disclosure requirements and easing the compliance burden on listed entities,” the release further added. During the board meeting, the regulator also relaxed a few norms that would make listing of startups easier. It reduced holding period for pre-issue capital by investors, revamped delisting rules and rationalised the existing framework related to reclassification of promoter and promoter group entities. The Sebi board also decided that top 1,000 companies by market capitalisation should disclose their Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report voluntarily from fiscal 2022 and compulsorily from fiscal 2023. The new reporting requirements are expected to bring in greater transparency through disclosure of material ESG-related information to enable market participants to identify and assess sustainability-related risks and opportunities. These requirements set the stage for taking a leap for better disclosures in the ESG space in India, the release said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sebi-asks-500-more-cos-to-detail-dividend-norms/articleshow/81695798.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Many refuse Covaxin across private hospitals in Kolkata||KOLKATA: Scores of recipients have refused to take Covaxin — India’s home-grown vaccine which is backed by the government — across Kolkata’s private hospitals, some of which received a larger supply of the indigenous vaccine over the last few days. At two private hospitals, around 5%-10% of recipients said they will take only Covishield, the local version of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine that is believed to be safer and more effective. The state is now giving hospitals the option to choose one and some have opted for Covishield. Thirteen recipients rejected Covaxin at Peerless Hospital on Wednesday. The hospital has received only Covaxin vials for recipients’ first dose this week. “Prior to this week, we had received only Covishield and there were no refusals. Some are wary of Covaxin, but we can’t help them since we have received only Covaxin vials for recipients’ first dose,” said CEO Sudipta Mitra. More than 150 received their first dose at Peerless on Thursday. “Some had refused Covaxin initially, but we managed to counsel and convince them,” said Mitra. He added that many were seeking advice on whether Covaxin was safe. “We are telling them that since our governments have endorsed them, both should be taken to be safe and effective. They are, however, reluctant,” said Mitra. Five recipients left the vaccination sites at RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences on Tuesday when told that the hospital was administering only Covaxin. RTIICS has since opted for Covishield. “We have been giving Covishield since January. Some are wary of Covaxin and, since we were given a choice, we decided to stick to Covishield,” said zonal head R Venkatesh. The preference for Covisield was “unfounded and unscientific”, said oncologist Subir Ganguly. “According to the latest studies, Covaxin has a higher efficacy. These are people who have been wrongly guided by social media. It’s important to get the vaccine and there’s no reason to believe that Covaxin will be ineffective or dangerous,” said Ganguly. AMRI Hospitals have been administering only Covishield at its Salt Lake and Mukundapur units while the Dhakuria unit offered both. “We have separate sites for the two and are giving recipients the option to choose. There have been some who refused to take a Covaxin shot in recent weeks. Since the Dhakuria unit has both, around 70% chose Covishield this week,” said CEO Rupak Barua.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/many-refuse-covaxin-across-pvt-hosps/articleshow/81694949.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Ahmedabad||Amid 3rd surge, only 28% in Ahmedabad have Covid antibodies||AHMEDABAD: Results of the latest sero-positivity survey carried out by Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) - fourth during the pandemic - brought both good and bad news for the city. The good news first - out of 10,136 persons covered under the survey carried out in February, 2,830 or 28% were found to have developed IgG antibodies against Covid-19. The number increased by 10% from the first sero survey conducted in June 2020 where only 18% were found to have developed it. The not-so-good news is that out of 359 confirmed positive Covid-19 recovered patients, only 233 or 65% were found to have antibodies. The rest have lost their safety cover which can make them susceptible for re-infection, said experts. Among the family contacts of patients, antibodies were found in less than half - 28% of the samples. The survey results have come at a time when the state has again recorded a major daily surge at 1,961 – recording 20 cases every 15 minutes – on Thursday. Ahmedabad and Surat – both cities recording 500-plus cases – accounted for more than half (54%) of the daily cases. Reflecting on the sero-positivity survey results, experts said that vaccination is the only way to increase ‘herd immunity’ which continues to elude the city. “Respective sero-positivity surveys have revealed that the community is not developing immunity against Corona. What's more, those who recovered from Covid-19 too are losing the immune cover," said a top AMC official. “In such a situation, getting vaccinated, wearing masks and maintaining social distancing protocols are the only way forward to fight with the pandemic.” The Ahmedabad district administration also carried out its first sero-positivity survey in December 2020. The paper ‘Population based Sero-prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 Specific IgG Antibodies in Rural Ahmedabad – A Case Control Study’ by Arun Mahesh Babu, DDO Ahmedabad, and Dr. Shilpa Yadav, deputy CDHO, Ahmedabad, got published in International Journal of Science and Research (IJSR) recently. The result indicated 25% overall sero-positivity in 2,301 samples taken. The figure included 46% among the positive patients, 21% among the patients’ relatives and 12% among the general population.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/amid-3rd-surge-only-28-in-abad-have-covid-antibodies/articleshow/81695605.cms||Paul John
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Health experts sound alarm about ‘super-spreader’ Holi||KOLKATA: Experts are worried about Holi turning into a super-spreader event at a time when the city is witnessing a resurgence in Covid cases. Since Holi is played in close physical proximity, the possibility of spreading the infection is very high and Bengal, which is already poll-bound, must desist from playing Holi as cases are likely to increase manifold if people don’t follow Covid-safety norms, they felt. “Holi marks the onset of spring, a time conducive to viral infections, including Covid, because of sudden meteorological changes. People, particularly the elderly, have to be careful,” said Arup Halder, a consultant pulmonologist. In ancient India, both dry and wet colours used to be sourced from nature. The herbal colours have the least adverse effect on health. But modern colours and gulal, produced industrially, are toxic cocktails. The manufacturing is poorly regulated as well. A series of tests by different organizations have found that the modern colours contain substances like suspected carcinogen malachite green, rhodamine and gentian violet. TimesViewForgoing a festival for one year may be the discreet thing to do, given the rise in Covid cases. Anyway, electioneering sans safe practices has put Bengal at an extra risk. Celebrating Dol and Holi like other years will only add to that.“Toxic agents, like lead oxide, mercury sulphite, copper sulphate and mica in gulal or abir leave no doubt about the irreversible impact they have on health,” said Sudipto Bhattacharya of Savior and Friends of Environment. “After every Holi, there is a sudden spurt of patients with inflammation of corona. This spurt also shows the element of toxins that enter our bodies and we have the least awareness about them," said ophthalmologist Smarajit Ganguly. “The PM 10 in gulal can affect the respiratory system. With the resurgence of Covid, it can complicate the situation,” said Debasis Basu, a preventive medicine expert. The best way is to use organic colours. But less than 10% products claim to be non-toxic. “There is also no study available to affirm or doubt these claims,” said researcher Jayanta Ghosh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/health-experts-sound-alarm-about-super-spreader-holi/articleshow/81694895.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

With a sudden spike in the number of cases, the district has been put on high alert. Special secretary of the health department, Manoj Kumar, told TOI that new Covid cases had been reported from different parts of Araria and the officials told to begin contact tracing, create microcontainment zones and look into the travel history of the patients. “Although no new variant has been detected in Bihar yet, nearly 5% of the positive samples will be sent to Odisha for a retest,” Manoj said, adding that neighbouring Supaul was also put on high alert even if it had reported only one Covid positive case. Some other districts, which reported an increase in the number of positive cases, were Patna (54), Begusarai (23), Rohtas (15), Samastipur (14), Bhagalpur (13) and Jehanabad (13). Besides, two deaths — one each from Patna and Vaishali — were registered on Thursday, taking Bihar’s toll to 1,567. Altogether 52,784 samples were tested in 24 hours in 33 districts of the state. A fortnight ago, only 45 people had tested positive for Covid in Bihar on March 11. There were 323 active cases back then. However, the number of active cases has reached 923 in the state in only two weeks. Meanwhile, as many as 1,02,192 vaccine shots were administered on Thursday. The beneficiaries included those who took both their first and second doses. Altogether 10.76 lakh senior citizens and 1.67 lakh people above the age of 45 years with comorbidities have been inoculated so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/state-records-258-new-covid-cases-araria-put-on-alert/articleshow/81694850.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Patna||‘Assault’ on MLAs: RJD’s Bihar bandh today||PATNA: Leader of opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav has called for Bihar Bandh on Friday against the assault on MLAs, which took place inside the Vidhan Sabha premises on Tuesday. Upping the ante against the government, Tejashwi said he would continue with his protests and repeated his demand for an apology from chief minister Nitish Kumar. RJD has also given its support to the nationwide strike called by the farmers' unions on Friday. At a press conference at the RJD office, Tejashwi came down heavily on the state police calling them CM's police and JD (U)'s goons belonging to a particular caste. “Nitish Kumar’s goons were roaming in the assembly in civil dress. Everyone knows how democratic values were crushed in the temple of democracy. Even female legislators were manhandled and yet Nitish Kumar gave a clean chit to his officials.” He said Wednesday’s incident will be remembered in history as a black day when atrocities were committed against legislators on Lohiya Jayanti and Shaheed Diwas. The younger Yadav scion claimed he had over 200 video footages to prove how opposition party legislators were kicked and thrashed. He even alleged the cops had intentionally targeted him during the march on Wednesday. “In a democracy, it is our right to raise issues and go for debate. But I was not allowed to speak. Our fight will continue and we are not afraid of Nitish Kumar’s police. He will have to roll back the law or bring changes in it,” said Tejashwi. “In 1974, socialist leaders had stopped the functioning of the House...That time Congress was ruling, yet no police were called inside the House. In 1986, Karpoori Thakur, who was the leader of the opposition, had staged a dharna in the House for three days and spent the night on a matter related to HEC. Nitish Kumar was one of the members of the House, but no police were called inside the House then.” However, JD (U) state spokesperson Arvind Nishad dismissed the allegations. “He is speaking out of frustration and is instigating his party members. He and his party members should follow decency in the assembly.” He added, “As far as the police are concerned, they are independent to take action and are not influenced by any political party. Again, calling for a bandh or a march is his democratic right, but RJD people should follow rules and regulation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/assault-on-mlas-rjds-bihar-bandh-today/articleshow/81694270.cms||Sheezan Nezami

Domestic mutual funds (MFs), on the other hand, had slightly reduced their stakes in India Inc, along with promoters and retail investors, according to a shareholding analysis by NSE. Official data showed that FPIs together owned 21.7% of NSE-listed companies, while MFs owned 7.4%. Investments by foreign funds were also concentrated in the Nifty 50 stocks. As much as 73% of their total funds in India were invested in these companies, the report noted. FPI ownership in the December quarter rose to 27.6% from 25.9% from the September quarter in the Nifty 50 companies. “This was the steepest sequential increase seen in last 46 quarters for the Nifty 50 universe, supported by record high FPI inflows of $20 billion into Indian equities during the December quarter,” the report noted. “The increase in FPI ownership was entirely led by financials”, excluding which it declined during the quarter, it said. The NSE report also noted that the number of stocks in the FPI portfolio has remained unchanged over the last decade, with inflows of $145 billion since 2010 merely leading to a larger share in existing stocks. FIIs have at least 5% ownership in 70% of the Nifty 500 companies and have nearly 74% and 93% of their investments made towards Nifty 50 and top 10% companies respectively, it said. The report also noted a decline in private promoter ownership following a steady rise over the previous three quarters, drop in ownership by domestic MFs for the third quarter in a row, partly attributed to continued moderation in SIP inflows, and redemption pressures and a marginal decline in direct retail ownership, reflecting some amount of profit-booking amid a huge market rally. The share of banks, financial institutions and insurance companies fell further to 5.1% — a fresh two-decadal low in the December quarter, the report noted. Holding by retail investors dropped more sharply in Nifty companies than in Nifty 500 companies. “The decline has been much steeper in the listed space excluding the Nifty 500 universe, and understandably so, given higher retail interest and ownership in smaller companies. A sharp rally in the December quarter paved the way for some profit-booking by retail investors who have otherwise been heavy buyers of Indian equities in 2020,” it noted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/india-incs-foreign-holding-at-record-high-nse-report/articleshow/81695720.cms||---

Well-placed sources confirmed that at least 102 monkeys were caught from the airport campus in three months from November 2020 to January 2021 with the help of district forest officials and released in remote areas. Forest department officials also confirmed that some 96 monkeys were relocated in February and March 25. According to forest department officials, monkeys jump over from the nearby Cantonment area. “Territorial fights keep taking place between the monkeys in the cantonment area due to which a bunch of them jump over the airport compound wall towards the airport runway. Special permission has been obtained based on which we have formed a team to address the monkey menace at the airport,” Sakira Begum, deputy conservator of forests – social forestry, Ahmedabad. Forest department officials have also pruned at least 200 trees so that monkeys don’t jump over the airport peripheral wall. An email query sent to city airport authorities about the issue did not elicit a response. A meeting of the Airport Environment Committee is held on a quarterly basis to discuss the issue of animal and bird sightings at the airport in addition to other measures that are required to keep both at bay in the interest of aircraft safety. The last meeting was held in mid-January during which the issue of relocation of monkeys and trimming of trees is being discussed. City airport authorities have been on the vigil to closely monitor animal sightings at the airport campus ever since it was taken over by Adani Ahmedabad International Airport Limited (AAIAL). Very recently a dog was also spotted in the operational area of the domestic terminal of the city airport but was chased away within minutes. “A dog was spotted near the operational area where aircrafts are parked; however, it was immediately chased away out of the airport campus and no flight movement was hampered. Officials have been on the vigil to address the issue,” said a source.

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat HC orders passport for teen||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court ordered the government to issue a passport to 18-year-old Vatsal Brahmbhatt, who needs it badly for immigration purposes and for further studies in the US after his passport expired in 2009 due to him overstaying in the US. The authority, the Indian Embassy in Chicago refused to renew his passport and the government insisted that the teen should return India first to get a new passport because after going to the US in 2008 on a visitor’s visa, he overstayed illegally. Brahmbhatt has been living with his grandparents since 2008 as their ward and completed his schooling in Illinois. He wanted admission to college, but did not have any document to establish his identity. The lack of his Indian passport was a hurdle in the immigration process initiated by his grandfather. According to case details as narrated in the HC order, Brahmbhatt’s grandfather, Dineshchandra, had gone to the US in 2005 on the immigration process initiated by his daughter. He became a US citizen in 2010. Meanwhile, his son Mitulkumar, daughter-in-law and grandson, Vatsal, visited the US on visitor visas in 2008. Brahmbhatt’s parents returned, but his grandparents kept the child with him in the US and insisted that he would complete his studies there. The grandparents decided to adopt him in the absence of his valid identity proof. Brahmbhatt’s passport, obtained when he was one year old, expired in 2009. In 2012, Dineshchandra applied for immigration for his son’s family. As the family was waiting for their visa call, Brahmbhatt approached the Indian Embassy for renewal of his passport, but was refused. Later, the Indian authorities insisted on his return. Brahmbhatt’s grandfather and father approached the high court last year. They argued that I-797C is in the name of his father and the child is a derivative beneficiary and is entitled to the same immigration benefits. Since he resides in the US, he has only filed the I-485 form for Adjustment of Status is the USA and thereafter will be extended the benefit of a green card. Before the court, the government argued that it would only be a visa notice and the status or benefit of immigration has not been accorded yet. After hearing the case, Justice Vipul Pancholi agreed with the petitioners’ arguments and ordered the government and its outsourcing agency to issue him a passport within four weeks after accepting the necessary fees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-orders-passport-for-teen/articleshow/81695005.cms||---

Explaining the significance of the Act, the two top officers said the BMP has been entrusted with the task of providing security to vital installations like Mahabodhi Mahavihara at Bodh Gaya and the Darbhanga airport. “The idea is to develop the BMP, which will be known as Bihar Special Armed Police (BSAP), on the pattern of the CISF,” they said. The two officers said the BSAP would be responsible for maintaining public order, combating extremism and providing better security to specified establishments. “Though they have been performing these duties at present, the Act will enable these duties to be discharged in an organised and efficient manner,” they added. The duo said the dependence of the state on the central armed police forces (CAPFs) has increased in the last few decades. “The number of companies of CAPFs deployed in the state increased from 23 in 2010 to 45 in 2020. The organised development of an armed police force will not only reduce dependence on CAPFs, but also lessen economic burden on the state. At the same time, it will also create employment opportunities for locals,” they said. Referring to provisions for arrest and search without warrants, the two senior officers said the powers of search and arrest are already available for the district armed police in their jurisdiction. The Act, however, gives such powers of search and arrest without warrants to the Special Armed Police officers only for the purposes of security of notified premises. “The objective of giving such powers is to prevent re-occurrence of cognizable crimes in such notified premises and to protect the life and property within such establishments,” Prasad and Singhal said. They said states like Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Odisha, Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh have their separate Acts for armed police. The two officers said the police were called inside the legislative assembly on Tuesday on the directive of the Speaker. Speaker seeks report from home department:State assembly Speaker Vijay Kumar Sinha on Thursday sought a report from the home department on police’s role during Tuesday’s violent scenes in and outside of the House. The Speaker has asked additional chief secretary (home) Chaitanya Prasad and DGP S K Singhal to furnish the list of the police personnel involved in misbehaving with the legislators and assaulting them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bsap-act-to-give-more-teeth-to-bmp-says-govt/articleshow/81694309.cms||Ramashankar

The incident took place when the girl, a Class VI student, was cleaning utensils outside her house around 6.30pm. Two local youths – Anima Kumar and Ajay Kumar – forcibly took the girl to a litchi orchard and raped her.

Waze was arrested on March 13 in connection with recovery of explosives from an SUV found parked near businessman Mukesh Ambani’s residence on February 25.

---||Mumbai||This month, Mumflat sales up 234%over last March||Mumbai: The stamp duty reduction from September 1, 2020, has not only increased apartment sales in Mumbai but also boosted the revenue of the state government. The 2-3% cut saw registration offices in Greater Mumbai collecting over Rs 2,578 crore between September 1, 2020, and March 24, 2021. During the previous seven-month period till August 2020, the collection was Rs 1,756 crore when the duty was at its peak of 5%. This month, sales grew 234% over March 2020, marking the highest YoY growth in the months after the stamp duty cut. There were 3,798 registrations in March 2020, and 12,696 this month, shows data collated by global property consultant Knight Frank. Revenue collection and apartment sales have zoomed after the state last year decided to temporarily reduce stamp duty from 5% to 2% from September till December 31, 2020, and 3% from January till March 31, 2021. Mumbai recorded registration of 75,688 apartments between September 1, 2020, and March 24, 2021, shows data collated by global property consultant Knight Frank. This month alone, 12,696 apartments were registered at a daily rate of 529 units. “This is nearly 4.3 times higher than the daily rate of registration recorded at 123 units in March 2020… At the current pace, the month of March 2021 can witness sales upwards of 17,000 units,” the report said. Total sales in 2019 were of 67,863 units, whereas registrations in 2020 have come comfortably close at 65,272 units. Registrations in the first three months of 2021 have almost reached the halfway mark of entire 2019 and 2020 at 33,280 units. The value of apartments sold in Mumbai in Jan-March 2021 totalled Rs 39,880 crore. “Since the reduction of stamp duty rates from September, apartments worth Rs 1.07 lakh crore have been sold. The total value of all apartments sold in 2020 was estimated to be around Rs 1 lakh crore, surpassing the 2019 mark of Rs 90,769 crore,” it said. “Reduction in stamp duty rate has helped mitigate the pain in the long-beleaguered real estate sector of Mumbai. As expected, with the revival of the economy, the sales momentum grew stronger in Q1 2021. A combination of lowest home loan rates, reduced house prices along with rebates and payment flexibility offered by developers, as well as increased household saving rates, has provided the environment for the residential segment to grow,” said Shishir Baijal, chairman & MD, Knight Frank India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/this-month-mumflat-sales-up-234over-last-march/articleshow/81697203.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

However, the majority of them were engaged for most of the time while the remaining refused to pick up their calls. Some students were lucky that helpline officials could pick up their calls, but the latter expressed inability to help them out leaving them frustrated.The panicked students and their parents then called on journalists on their mobiles and their office landlines informing them about their grievances. They pointed out that either the 12 helplines are engaged or their calls weren’t picked up despite repeated attempts.Some of them tried to call Board of Examination and Evaluation (BOEE) director Prafulla Sable, but his phone was also continuously engaged as he too was receiving numerous calls.In the morning when he talked to TOI, Sable refused to share details of helplines stating that those were provided to the students on a website and they would be able to see it after they logged in. “The numbers weren’t made public as many people like parents unnecessarily call on them asking irrelevant questions,” he said.Vice-chancellor Subhash Chaudhari told TOI that the helplines were engaged as panicky students called on them simultaneously. “We’ve deployed more manpower for entire exam work, including for the helplines as we’re anticipating such problems on the first day. Being a new system, it was bound to happen. However, there’s no need for the students to panic as we will not let them suffer on account of such technical glitches,” he said, adding that their exams would be rescheduled.Even in summer 2020 exams, the helplines were continuously engaged initially and then the NU officials refused to pick up the calls as they too didn’t have answers to students’ queries.They told TOI on anonymity that they deliberately dropped calls as their seniors didn’t disclose them on what kind of technical glitches system was facing and the students vented their ire on them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/varsitys-helplines-turn-helpless-in-hour-of-need/articleshow/81708617.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Delhi||From Delhi University student leader to a life of murder, extortion||NEW DELHI: Rohit Chaudhary's transformation from a student leader at Shaheed Bhagat Singh College to a top 10 wanted gangster could make a good movie script. It began around a decade ago with political rivalry, which led him to his first murder. Over the next few years, he has had the cops in pursuit for his involvement in dozens of cases of murder, extortion, land-grabbing and robbery. Bhisham Singh, DCP (Crime), grudgingly said that Chaudhary had been very innovative when evading arrest. He made clever use of technology to avoid being pinpointed. He used his phone dongle's internet and VOIP apps to communicate, taking care not to mount any SIM card in his phone. Ironically, the cops outdid him after being tipped off about his modus operandi by two of his associates they had arrested. Chaudhary’s latest was to join hands with gangster Ankit Gujjar to form the Chaudhary-Gujjar syndicate that was focused on expanding their network in south Delhi. The cops have intercepted the former’s calls to Gujjar who is lodged in Tihar jail and will, therefore, interrogate the imprisoned criminal too. Till a few years ago, Chaudhary was in cahoots with another gangster, Prince. However, they parted ways after being arrested together in a Lado Sarai murder case in 2015. While operating from jail, they became arch rivals and their gang members have been attacking each other since then. The rivalry is mostly over extortion of money from builders and bookies. Last May, Chaudhary's hitmen gunned down 28-year-old Prince in south Delhi’s Pushp Vihar when the gangster was walking towards a mall with friends after appearing at a hearing in a Saket court nearby. Chaudhary and his men, Badal, Satender and Ashfaq, fired at Prince from close range, killing him at the spot. In November 2019, Chaudhary gunned down another rival, Sudhir, at a marriage function in Hapur, making it to UP police's wanted list. A Crime Branch officer said they discovered that several young boys had joined Chaudhary's gang of late, having been lured with promises of a lavish lifestyle, luxury cars and dominance in society. “Many of these gang members turned out to be first timers when arrested in cases of extortion or shootouts,” the officer disclosed. The cops will interrogate Chaudhary about the land-grab syndicate he was running in Aya Nagar and other areas in south Delhi. They are now in pursuit of his absconding associates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/from-du-student-leader-to-a-life-of-murder-extortion/articleshow/81695783.cms||---

The second relief comes in the form of installation of taxi meters without cost,” he said. Following the budget provision, taxi drivers can soon go ahead and install the digital taxi meters free of cost. The minister said that backhand systems to monitor the vehicles and the provision of a panic button are some of the features yet to be added to these digital meters, following which installation can commence. “We will also revise the rates considering petrol and diesel prices that have gone up. The meters will have to be installed mandatorily else we will cancel their permit and license as a result of which they will not be able to operate their vehicles,” Godinho said. After the the tourism department hands over the airport taxi counter to the transport department, the minister said that he will hold a meeting with taxi operators to resolve the various issues. He said that the budget proposal to bring few private buses under Kadamba Transport Corporation Ltd will be taken up on a pilot basis on two routes — Canacona to Margao and Ponda to Panaji — where currently 140 buses operate. Revenue sharing will be based on per km basis. “Once the experiment works well, we can expand it to the rest of Goa wherever possible and have a combination of synergies of operation of public transport and government bus service.” Godinho said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/install-digital-meter-else-lose-licence-mauvin/articleshow/81696808.cms||---

Desai, a deputy mamlatdar of e-Dhara centre in Kalol, was booked by the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) in January for having assets worth Rs 55 crore. His total income over 14 years was computed to be about Rs 25 crore. While refusing legal protection from arrest, the court took into consideration various submissions made by the investigating agency in the case. After hearing the case, the principal sessions judge Nipa Raval observed that interrogation of the accused is required. “He was a government servant and the society expects very high values from government servants. If the accused has acquired disproportionate property and even after the allegation of huge disproportionate assets if the court will release accused on anticipatory bail then it is clear encouragement to the government servants who have engaged themselves in such type of offences, and secondly the society will lose faith on the courts and it would leave impression on common people that even if government servants are caught for the offence like disproportionate property then also they are released on anticipatory bail,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/pre-arrest-bail-denied-to-ex-govt-officer/articleshow/81695002.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Online food orders become the new normal again||Bhopal: Ever since the Sunday lockdown returned in the state capital, online food orders have also gathered pace all over again. More families are ordering food online now to enjoy hotel food at home, particularly on weekends. These orders are expected to increase like last year in the next couple of days especially during Holi, as restaurants have been asked not to welcome clients on their premises and serve only online or take home orders. Last year, the online food ordering had witnessed a sharp rise during lockdown and even later as pandemic spread its tentacles. “Online food ordering was majorly done by the students before lockdown. After lockdown the families indulged in it as students went back to their respective homes. Instead of eating in restaurants, families preferred eating outside food at home and almost similar situation prevails now,” said a hotel employee, Prakash Chandra. Things are back to lockdown basics, yet again. “Even those people have started ordering food online, who were avoiding it earlier. When restaurant food is available at your doorstep, who will not go for that,” said Nilesh Kumar, a resident of Kolar area. Foodies claim that online ordering is the best option to eat with family, when you need a change of taste. “There are several good hotels which provide decent food, safely. I always order food online during weekend,” said Anil Shukla, a diehard foodie.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/online-food-orders-become-the-new-normal-again/articleshow/81694996.cms||---
---||Delhi||To dilute Covid gloom, whet your appetite for tradition this Holi||Rang, bhang and large boisterous gatherings, these are the pop images we associate with Holi, the festival of colours, when the otherwise rigid Indian social structures are loosened for a bit of fun and frolic. This year, however, as public gatherings stand banned due to the rising Covid-19 cases in the city, you may not be able to necessarily get dunked in a haudi—or swimming pool—full of coloured water. But this doesn’t mean that your festivities have to be necessarily pheeka (colourless). Instead, it may be time to discover some of the lost traditions and foods associated with Holi. Most people do not realise that Holi is not a one- or two-day festival. In fact, if you are reading this in the early hours, you are in the midst of Rang Pashi, the first day of Holi that began on Wednesday, celebrated by various communities on either ekadashi or dwadashi (the 11th or 12th day of the waxing moon, according to the lunar calendar). Over time, this tithi has been forgotten, but in traditional homes, this is the day when gujiyas and papdi (thin and fried besan discs, different from the maida papdi of chatwallas) were made and the ritual of rang chhidkayi on elder members of the family (who then offered token sums of money to youngsters as gifts) was practised. Rang Pashi, thus, was a day for the family. The women of the household were gifted specially-made pink mulmul sarees with gota and kinari embellishment called dandia, which they wore on rang pasha and then played Holi in. In fact, while most people associate Holi boisterousness with Rang Barse, the famous Silsila song, if you take your eyes off the Amitabh-Rekha pair and pay close attention, you will notice Jaya Bachchan wearing a dandia. These beautiful sarees were made months in advance of the festival and were an important gift to daughters and daughters-in-law, but that craftsmanship is now lost. Rang Pashi, literally to water in a nurturing way (the word pashi connotes the act of irrigation), may have inspired the Mughal name for Holi too: Aab-e-Pashi (aab meaning water). It was celebrated with the same spirit of joy by Mughal aristocracy from the time of Jehangir to Bahadur Shah Zafar, making the festival symbolic of the country’s syncretic spirit. A common food associated with the syncretic spirit of Holi is meethe chawal, coloured with turmeric. Part of this culture was also poetry and music associated with Holi. However, while mushairas such as the famous Shankar-Shaad mushaira at Modern School Barakhamba Road, or Hasya Kavi sammelans typically held this time of the year were public affairs, more intimate family celebrations comprised singing of traditional “horis”, semi-classical or folk songs, typically with Krishna-Radha paying in Braj themes. Some of these horis go back a few hundred years and were written when Shahjahanabad was the cultural capital of India. This year, do rediscover these. We know that colours were made of flowers like tesu or palash, but the flower, according to Ayurveda, has therapeutic cooling properties too. In fact, traditionally, in some parts of India people would tie them in their turbans or cloths tied to their heads to protect themselves from the hot summer wind. Around Holi, a cooling sherbet was made by some families by soaking the flowers in water and seasoned with fennel, lime, black salt, etc. The recipes can be found online. But Old Delhi’s typical Holi time treat is kaanji-bade, fermented mustard seed water with moong dal badas soaked in it. While the black carrot kanji is a winter drink, kanji-bada fermented in earthen pots connote Holi and are a probiotic eat that you can make easily at home or even order from restaurants. Then there is chaat whose season only began with Holi, since chaat masalas made of typically pungent spices like back pepper were thought to be therapeutic in spring. Some disappearing chaats of Delhi include fruit cups or kulle filled with chickpeas in a tangy lime dressing, garnished with slivers of ginger, and sans dahi-saunth. Then, there is the Delhi aloo tikki, stuffed with chana daal for better texture, cut into halves and served with saunth and coriander chutney.

---||Lucknow||UP: BSP cadre in a flux over political alignment, leadership transition||LUCKNOW: The UP assembly elections are now less than a year away, but Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) cadres are befuddled about the party leadership succession plan as well as its confusing stand vis-a-vis BJP, which is in power both at Centre and in the state. BSP supremo Mayawati has been supporting the Union government on various issues and is not inclined at all to ally with Congress or Samajwadi Party for the 2022 polls, and rather sees them as rivals fighting for the same votes. BSP workers and staunch supporters are hence in a dilemma; whether to go full throttle in opposing BJP and targeting the government or not. BJP has already hit poll campaign mode with celebrations of its fourth year in term while SP chief Akhilesh Yadav is touring extensively and Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra is attending kisan panchayats, seeking a pie of votes of farmers protesting against farm laws. Mayawati has, however, restricted herself to making occasional press statements in an advisory tone to governments and sharing views via tweets, giving rivals the opportunity of calling BSP the B-team of BJP. Besides, there has been no clarity on succession in leadership since Mayawati’s nephew Akash Kumar has failed to may any impact since being tipped to take the mantle from her. Akash was appointed party’s national coordinator by Mayawati with much fanfare before 2019 polls, pitchforking him to a role where he was seen as her successor for taking over the reigns. Akash, however, has not made any key contribution and has not lived up to the expectations of cadres who want a dynamic leadership to take on Bhim Army chief Chandra Shekhar who is trying to wean away votes from BSP, says a political analyst. Since BSP has been out of power for eight years now, the 2022 elections would be a battle of survival for it since its foot soldiers are turning restless. Realising her growing age, Maywati had tried to hand over the reins to her brother Anand Kumar and had appointed him as party’s national vice-president but removed him after severe criticism over starting dynasty rule in BSP, and had reinstated him later. Anand had retreated after the Income Tax department raided his residence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bsp-cadre-in-a-flux-over-political-alignment-leadership-transition/articleshow/81696540.cms||Subhash Mishra
---||Ahmedabad||Savarkar row: Congress MLA Rutwik Makwana rebuked||GANDHINAGAR: Gujarat assembly speaker Rajendra Trivedi reprimanded Congress MLA Rutwik Makwana on Thursday over his statements made in the house regarding V D Savarkar last week. The speaker reprimanded Makwana as he failed to authenticate allegations he made about Hindutva ideologue Savarkar. The speaker had earlier expunged his statement from the record. “Last week, I had asked MLA Rutwik Makwana to substantiate his statements on Savarkar, which he has duly done in the form of a reply. The MLA has quoted a few news articles in his reply on March 22. His reply does not satisfactorily substantiate his allegations and so I am reprimanding him,” the speaker said. Leader of opposition Paresh Dhanani requested half an hour to discuss the issue. Senior BJP MLA and education minister Bhupendra Chudasama intervened, asking the speaker, “Is the leader of opposition supporting Rutwik Makwana’s claims or is he challenging the order of the speaker?” That sparked off an exchange of words between Chudasama and Dhanani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/savarkar-row-congress-mla-rebuked/articleshow/81695013.cms||---

In the largest whole genome sequencing carried out so far in the country, the SARS-CoV-2 Consortium on Genomics (INSACOG)—a group of 10 national laboratories under India's health ministry—checked 10,787 samples from across the country and found 771 “variants of concerns” including the double mutant. The double mutant was found in 223 samples, including 206 from Maharashtra. “It has mutations in two positions as compared to other variants in circulation,” said Dr Rakesh Kumar Mishra, director of Hyderabad-based Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology that is one of the 10 laboratories involved. Read AlsoCovid-19: ‘Double mutant’ among 771 variants found in 18 statesA total of 771 Covid variants, including a “double mutant”, have been found across 18 Indian states but there is no evidence to link the current surge in some states to these strains, officials said on Wednesday. States witnessing higher cases have revealed a different mutation profile but detectedThe double mutations—namely E484Q and L452R—were known as separate entities. While the E484Q mutation was found in Maharashtra and Telangana, the L452R is a relatively new find in India and originally from California, US. Dr Nerges Mistry from the Foundation for Medical Research in Mumbai said double mutations are not uncommon among microorganisms.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); “Mutations are common among viruses. When a virus is under pressure from use of medications and vaccines and development of herd immunity, it would mutate even more,” she said. Double mutation is one such response. The findings come even as Maharashtra is in the throes of the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, government experts are sure the double mutant variant is not responsible for the second wave.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); “About 80% of the 1,600 samples tested from Maharashtra didn't have variants of concerns. We hence cannot say the mutants are responsible for the ongoing second wave there,” said Dr Mishra. These samples were taken from clusters and randomly collected swabs. “However, more tests will be done on a larger scale in the coming week to get details,” added Dr Mishra. Read AlsoNew double mutant Covid-19 variant found in India: What we know so farA new double mutant Covid-19 variant has been found in India, said the government on Wednesday. Several Variants of Concerns (VOCs) have been found in India previously, however, the ministry of health said that the cases of new variants are limited in number. Govt said it could not be sufficientlyThe main concern right now is ability of these mutants to “escape” antibodies released by vaccines. “We need a vaccine that will take care of such responses,” said a senior doctor from a BMC hospital. “The point is whether vaccine production can keep pace with virus mutations,” said Dr Mistry. In case of the influenza or flu, the vaccine has kept abreast of mutations; the shot is reworked every year on the basis of year-long surveillance to detect the most common flu strains in circulation across the globe. But in case of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19, there is limited information so far. “We don’t know how it behaves with weather change or what drives it. That information is still a work in progress.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-pressure-from-medication-may-have-led-to-double-mutation/articleshow/81695800.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||Kanpur||UPPCB orders closure of 95 Jajmau tanneries indefinitely||Kanpur: The Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) has ordered closure of 95 tanneries in Jajmau for an indefinite period with immediate effect as pumping station number 3 and Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) are overflowing. In its order dated March 19, 2021, UPPCB also ordered disconnection of the power and water supply of all these all tanneries. The order was received by Kanpur district magistrate on Wednesday. UPPCB has also directed the owners of all tanneries to install CCTV cameras in their units within a month and submit their compliance reports. In compliance of the order, the DM constituted four teams comprising an additional city magistrate and one engineer each of regional pollution control board and Kesco. The teams supervised disconnection of power of around a dozen tanneries on Thursday. Around 217 tanneries in Jajmau have been operating as per 15-day roster issued by the DM on July 31, 2020. The tanneries linked to pumping station one operate in the first fortnight of the month and those linked with pumping station no. 3 (Wazidpur pumping station) in the second fortnight. Jal Nigam officials had given a report to the regional pollution control board informing that tanneries linked with pumping station number 3 were discharging their effluents in domestic sewer due to which the STP was overflowing. The RPCB issued show-cause notice to tannery operators but the overflowing problem persisted. The RPCB then informed its state headquarters and administrative officers following which UPPCB chief environment officer Ajay Kumar Sharma ordered closure of the 95 tanneries linked to pumping station number 3. Firoz Alam, office bearer of Small Tanners’ Association, termed the order arbitrary. “The officials don’t even hear our versions and closure order is issued. All tanneries have flow meters which are connected to the CPCB server for monitoring,” he said. “Also there is no sewer line in Jajmau area. The domestic effluents reached the pumping station and caused overflow. This should be checked,” he claimed. RPCB engineer Anil Mathur said, “The flow meters can be bypassed and there is no system by which 24-hour monitoring can be done. The problem was the overflowing of STP and that has to be stopped.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/uppcb-orders-closure-of-95-jajmau-tanneries-indefinitely/articleshow/81694531.cms||---

According to Sachin Gawde, police inspector at Thane traffic department, resident Jagdish Yadav (47) met with an accident at Nagala Bunder after his bike skid on the stretch following which his bag full of valuables worth over three lakhs was thrown away to the roadside. Constables Navnath Thorve, Rajendra More and Avinash Waghchaure rushed to the spot and following a quick discussion, the former escorted the injured to Vedant Hospital in an auto while the latter looked for valuables that could have been left behind and spotted the bag lying unattended at the roadside. The cop found Rs 70,000 cash along with ornaments worth 2.5 Lakh and two mobile phones and crucial documents in the bag. The constable alerted the police control room and ensured the bag was later handed over to the victim’s wife. Officials said ideally, the police was expected to simply ensure and manage the traffic situation at the spot and alert ambulance to escort the victim away but with their exemplary dedication, their seniors are now planning to felicitate the trio. Balasaheb Patil, DCP Thane traffic police, said, "Often victims are in the trauma of the mishap and the fear of losing their belongings is yet another cause of worry for them.

The team of officials led by ADM Finance that conducted the inquiry has submitted its report to district magistrate Bhanu Chandra Goswami. “The inquiry committee constituted to probe the incident has submitted its report. I am now writing to the department of fertilizers and am recommending a safety audit of the IFFCO plant,” the DM told TOI. Two labourers had died and 16 others were injured on Tuesday when steam boiler number 4 of the power plant at IFFCO unit had exploded. In all, three different teams, including experts of plant management and district administration officials, are investigating the tragic incident. “An FIR under Section 304 (negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide) of IPC has been lodged against the IFFCO management and suitable action would be taken,” said SP trans-Ganga, Dhawal Jaiswal. The probe teams had inspected the plant on Wednesday and Thursday and examined the boiler. The experts also questioned the engineer and employees maintaining the boiler and examined the maintenance report. The probe committee found that maintenance of the boiler had been done but NOC had not been taken afterwards as per norms. Deputy director (factory) Abhay Chandra Gupta and other officials also conducted their probe on Thursday. Gupta said a report will be prepared after examining the entire factory. “It seems the maintenance of the boiler was not up to the mark and the boiler was running without procuring NOC from the authorities concerned which is a serious offence. We will complete our inspection and submit a report to the administration. A complaint would also be lodged in the court of the CJM,” said Gupta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/iffco-plant-boiler-did-not-have-noc-inquiry-panel/articleshow/81694440.cms||---

From colours to sweets and namkeens to liquor, several commercial activities have witnessed a downward trend. “Festival business has gone down by more than 50 per cent as the customer is eluding from the market; we are surprised by the suddenness of the decision. We are not against precaution, but things could have been organised in a better way,” lamented the traders. One of the shopkeepers said requesting anonymity, “The government has all the data but still it takes decision at the eleventh hour. This leads to huge losses of seasonal business.”  A namkeen shop owner said, “We have stopped stocking namkeen as there is no demand. Earlier, we used to have at least 7 people to manage the customers during Holi, but this time only two employees are more than enough for the task." President of New Market Traders’ Association, Sunil Gangrade, also admitted that as festivals approach, customers are missing from bazar. “Night curfew has affected the business but we understand this is also the need of the hour,” he said. Usually, liquor sale increases substantially during this time, but things are different now. A liquor contractor confessed, “If the 8 pm lockdown is implemented just before Holi, there will be hardly any sale. The Sunday lockdown before Holi will see zero sales.” All those Holi Milan programmes, organised at this time, also stand cancelled, leading to huge losses to catering industry. Shivshakti Agrawal, a caterer in Bhopal said, “ Yet another season of catering business is slipping away from us; the way things stand, summer shadi season is also likely to be affected adversely like last year.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/holi-bazar-loses-colour-as-covid-cases-surge/articleshow/81695017.cms||Deshdeep Saxena

Tharun said students, especially from tier-2 and tier-3 colleges, are struggling to get internships and placements and added that his startup, Sixinterns, aims to help such students. “I failed to get any internship in the second semester of third year. That’s when I realised how hard it is to get an internship and decided to start my own firm,” the final year engineering student said. He said that in the last year his startup had helped over 5,000 students fetch paid internships. A student of Lovely Professional University, Tharun said that along with brushing up technical skills of a student, they also train them in soft skills on a case-to-case basis. The firm is not just helping engineering students, but others as well as they cater to auditing, marketing, data entry, among other firms. Several of their interns said to have performed exceedingly well leading to pre-placement offers from companies. “Training is provided by our staff, who studied at IITs, NITs or other top colleges,” he said. Explaining his business model, the 21-year-old said that his firm has ties with corporates and connects students with them after providing required training. “Our firm also observes interns as we have several ongoing projects. We take projects from big firms and get the work completed by interns. The money we get paid is shared with interns,” he said and added that an intern gets paid a minimum of Rs 8, 000 at their firm. Tharun said his firm also trained the less fortunate and uneducated, who have no computer knowledge, and helped them in getting placed in voice processing, customer support, and other related roles. Till now, Tharun has collaborated with around 15 MNCs and was training over 10,000 students to hone their professional skills.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/denied-internship-city-lad-whips-up-a-startup/articleshow/81696547.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

While a meeting of the DRDA is supposed to be held every month, the governing body of the DRDA is expected to meet once in three months. The DRDA is the principal body at the district level to manage and oversee implementation of different anti-poverty programmes of theministry of rural development. Data compiled by the government in response to numerous questions by Congress MLAs said that against 792 expected meetings, only 105 meetings of the DRDA were held in two years across the state.

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: TRS in no hurry to announce candidate for Sagar bypoll||HYDERABAD: With the successful formula of announcing the candidate in the last minute in the recently concluded MLC polls, the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) appears to have decided on implementing the same strategy in the Nagarjuna Sagar bypoll too. In the Hyderabad-Rangareddy-Mahbubnagar graduates constituency, the TRS had announced its candidate Vani Devi two days after the nomination process began, and the result was in favour of the pink party. Sources in the TRS said the party would see twin benefits by delaying the naming of the candidate. Firstly, it can spring a surprise for the other parties with the selection of the candidate, and secondly, it can prevent its leaders from being poached by other parties and field them in the poll. It can also stop rebel candidates from filing nominations. The nomination process for the bypoll began a couple of days ago and the last date for nominations is March 30. While the polling will take place on April 17, the counting will take place on May 2. The bypoll was necessitated due to the demise of TRS MLA from Nagarjuna Sagar Nomula Narsimhaiah a couple of months ago. TRS said the chief minister is busy with assembly sessions and would focus on selection of candidate after March 26 after the sessions conclude. However, sources said that the party is in a dilemma over giving a ticket to the deceased MLA Narasimhaiah’s son Nomula Bharat or other local candidates such as Tera Chinappa Reddy. Interestingly, the BJP is also waiting for the TRS to finalise the candidate for strategic reasons. The Congress has already announced that senior leader K Jana Reddy would contest from the constituency in the bypoll. Though TRS has not finalised its candidate yet, the party has already begun campaigning in the constituency by deploying legislators and other leaders. For instance, Chennur MLA Balka Suman is camping in the district overseeing the campaigning. “Like we did in the MLC elections, booth level in-charges will be appointed and door-to-door campaign will be taken up within the limited time,” a senior TRS leader said. “The Congress party has not done anything for the people of Nagarjuna Sagar constituency. Congress leader K Jana Reddy, who represented the constituency seven times, was responsible for the backwardness of the constituency. People will definitely support TRS in this election like in 2018 elections,” Balka Suman told TOI. He said the party’s developmental works would definitely help in getting a positive vote.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trs-in-no-hurry-to-announce-candidate-for-sagar-bypoll/articleshow/81695028.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Bhopal||Virus curbs gobble a large pie of restaurant business in Madhya Pradesh||BHOPAL: Even before the district collector passed an order prohibiting sitting and eating at restaurants or hotels, allowing only serving orders online or extending take home facility to the customers, business volume of the hotels and restaurants fell by 80 to 90% on Thursday. The state cabinet had decided to ban sitting and eating in hotels and restaurants in all the districts, where 20 cases have been reported in a day on an average, in the last one week. Principal secretary, home, Rajesh Rajora, issued the order during the day and crisis management group of the district was formally supposed to impose the restriction in the evening but restaurants and restaurants in hotels, cafes and bars wore a deserted look during the entire day. “On the first day itself, the volume of our business has dropped by 90%. We have still not come out of the lockdown jolt, and here we are back to lockdown situation, when hotels and restaurants remained closed for days, and then, only take home facility was allowed. Parcel food is still a new idea, you don’t get too many orders here. Media reports were enough to keep people off the restaurants and hotels though there was order by the home department to that effect later in the day”, said a manager at hotel Surendra Vilas. Expressing disappointment over the decision, Sanjay Mehra of Sagar Restaurant said, “Hotels and restaurants are places where you don’t have a crowd but guests, who have come for dinner or lunch. We have a system in place; guests are thermal screened and sanitised. They sit at a hygienic place, eat good food and drink clean water. The government seems to suggest that hotels and restaurants are spreading coronavirus. Here, people don’t move around. They come with family and acquaintances, have food and go. There is no crowd, no queues and two groups of people sit apart. I don’t know why hotels and restaurants are targeted every time there is spurt in coronavirus cases. It seems as if the virus is in hotels and restaurants and all other places, where people are going in hordes are safe.” Mehra said take home business is minuscule. “Restaurants run because of clients, who come with family and friends. Everything is served from our kitchen. In take home order, you order one or two things and rest is cooked at home. These two are very different things and volume of business reduces by 80%, if a restriction like this is imposed”, he said. The owner of an ice cream parlour, said, “We only have 3-4 months of brisk business - from March to June. Last year, we lost business in this period in lockdown and this year again, we seem to be moving in the same direction. Our customers, most of them youngsters, sit at the parlour, have ice cream but after the ban on allowing customers to sit at the eateries, cafes and parlours, you can see there is nobody in the parlour.” The roadside vendors may not suffer much due to ban as most of their business is in “take home” mode as people may not take snacks home but they don’t sit at the vendor’s outlet either. “People have not been very keen to have snacks from our outlets following the restrictions but the ban on sitting in restaurants will not impact us as we have no place to offer to the customer to sit and eat,” said Rajat Verma, who sells snacks by the roadside in Trilanga.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/virus-curbs-gobble-a-large-pie-of-restaurant-business/articleshow/81695029.cms||Ashutosh Shukla

He is not keen on contesting the Nagarjunasagar by-election, but is gearing up to campaign against the ruling TRS. “I am not interested in contesting in Nagarjunasagar, but will certainly launch an aggressive social media campaign against TRS,” Mallana, whose real name is C Naveen Kumar, told TOI. The by-poll is on April 17 and counting of votes on May 2. As many as five independents filed nominations on Tuesday. On the political grapevine that the BJP is holding negotiations with him to contest on saffron party ticket, Mallanna said some BJP leaders had approached him, but he do not want to associate with any political party presently. However, BJP chief spokesperson K Krishna Saagar Rao said BJP was a national party and has an electoral process to select and nominate a candidate. BJP does not reach out to individuals outside the party. “The BJP is already confabulating on finalising its candidate for Nagarjunasagar by-poll,” he said. Mallanna was involved in a close contest with Palla Rajeshwar Reddy of TRS in the recently-concluded Nalgonda-Warangal-Khammam graduates’ MLC constituency election and finished runners up with 1.49 lakh first and second preference votes. His first priority is to campaign against the ruling party which has failed to fulfill the aspirations of the people in the new state and later take on other political parties. “I am not in favour of any political party. I will continue as an independent candidate until I get total support of the people to form a new political party,” he said. While Congress is planning to hold a public meeting at Haliya in Nagarjuna Sagar segment on March 27 and its candidate K Jana Reddy expected to file his nomination on March 29, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao is likely to announce the party candidate soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/mallanna-to-queer-the-pitch-for-trs-with-social-media-campaign/articleshow/81695037.cms||Roushan Ali

The state cabinet had decided to ban sitting and eating in hotels and restaurants in all the districts, where 20 cases have been reported in a day on an average, in the last one week. Principal secretary, home, Rajesh Rajora, issued the order during the day and crisis management group of the district was formally supposed to impose the restriction in the evening but restaurants and restaurants in hotels, cafes and bars wore a deserted look during the entire day. “On the first day itself, the volume of our business has dropped by 90%. We have still not come out of the lockdown jolt, and here we are back to lockdown situation, when hotels and restaurants remained closed for days, and then, only take home facility was allowed. Parcel food is still a new idea, you don’t get too many orders here. Media reports were enough to keep people off the restaurants and hotels though there was order by the home department to that effect later in the day”, said a manager at hotel Surendra Vilas. Expressing disappointment over the decision, Sanjay Mehra of Sagar Restaurant said, “Hotels and restaurants are places where you don’t have a crowd but guests, who have come for dinner or lunch. We have a system in place; guests are thermal screened and sanitised. They sit at a hygienic place, eat good food and drink clean water. The government seems to suggest that hotels and restaurants are spreading coronavirus. Here, people don’t move around. They come with family and acquaintances, have food and go. There is no crowd, no queues and two groups of people sit apart. I don’t know why hotels and restaurants are targeted every time there is spurt in coronavirus cases. It seems as if the virus is in hotels and restaurants and all other places, where people are going in hordes are safe.” Mehra said take home business is minuscule. “Restaurants run because of clients, who come with family and friends. Everything is served from our kitchen. In take home order, you order one or two things and rest is cooked at home. These two are very different things and volume of business reduces by 80%, if a restriction like this is imposed”, he said. The owner of an ice cream parlour, said, “We only have 3-4 months of brisk business - from March to June. Last year, we lost business in this period in lockdown and this year again, we seem to be moving in the same direction. Our customers, most of them youngsters, sit at the parlour, have ice cream but after the ban on allowing customers to sit at the eateries, cafes and parlours, you can see there is nobody in the parlour.” The roadside vendors may not suffer much due to ban as most of their business is in “take home” mode as people may not take snacks home but they don’t sit at the vendor’s outlet either. “People have not been very keen to have snacks from our outlets following the restrictions but the ban on sitting in restaurants will not impact us as we have no place to offer to the customer to sit and eat,” said Rajat Verma, who sells snacks by the roadside in Trilanga.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/indore/virus-curbs-gobble-a-large-pie-of-restaurant-business/articleshow/81701801.cms||Ashutosh Shukla

He said chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has already announced that the government would fill vacancies. The minister, who also introduced enhancement of retirement age to the state government employees in the assembly on Thursday, said that due to improved health conditions and lifestyle, the government has decided to continue to utilize the services of experienced employees in administration. The issue was discussed with the employees’ unions and also put before the Pay Revision Commission (PRC), Harish Rao said “As of now, retirement age for state government employees is 58 years, while it is 60 years for IVth class employees. For teaching staff in medical colleges, the retirement age is 65 years and for judiciary employees the age limit is 60 years. In some states, retirement age is between 60 and 62 years,” he said. The minister said TRS had promised to increase the retirement age during 2018 assembly elections and has now fulfilled its promise. “This will not impact the filling of vacancies in government departments and unemployed youth need not worry about it. The employees will be given promotions from time to time and vacancies will be filled accordingly.’ Harish Rao said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/govt-will-take-steps-to-fill-50000-vacancies-harish/articleshow/81695036.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Goa||A year on, state yet to learn from mistakes||Panaji: A spurt in Covid-19 cases this month has increased the workload for health care workers (HCWs), and as they fear a further rise in new infections in days to come, the insensitivity of people in following Covid-19 measures has infuriated them to no end. What we learnt over the past one year of the pandemic, they say, has been fast forgotten. “We learned some lessons but have also forgotten them swiftly. People have forgotten that we still live in pandemic times. They don’t want to wear masks, and these include even the HCWs,” Dr Anil Mehndiratta, a chest specialist from Vasco, said. A noted doctor in Panaji said he doesn’t want to teach or appeal to people anymore. He said has been “totally frustrated by their overall behaviour”. “There has been complete indifference towards wearing masks. Over the past few days I have seen eight to ten fresh cases of Covid -19 every day. We have been working relentlessly for the past so many months without taking leave even for a week. Seems like people want us to die working. No, they haven’t taken any lesson from the pandemic,” he said. The doctors opine that reluctance on the part of the government to crackdown on people violating Covid safety measures has contributed to the problem. “You see politicians conduct meetings, participate in functions without any regard for the pandemic. So how do we expect people to follow standard operating procedures (SOPs) when our elected representatives are reckless. We had municipal elections and there will be Holi celebrations this week. Hotels are organising parties and people will party as if there is no tomorrow,” said a health officer in North Goa. Chief minister Pramod Sawant’s refusal to impose even limited restrictions such as asking travellers to produce a Covid negative certificate, for fear of annoying the hospitality sector, hasn’t gone down well with many. Netizens questioned the CM on social media if it is only the responsibility of citizens of Goa to take measures while tourists can behave the way they want. They said the government has misplaced priorities. “Isn’t it obvious what’s more important to the government?” “It’s an open secret that parties are being conducted in tourism belts without following any SOPs. Where is the action against the violators? Has the licence of any hotel or a club suspended?” a health officer in North Goa said. Earlier this week, health minister Vishwajit Rane said he was of the opinion that inorder to stop crowding, there should be a restriction on the number of people that should be allowed in a hotel or a club, and a limit to the number of people attending a function, wedding or any other events. Rane has shared his email on his twitter handle and appealed to the public to share pictorial evidence of crowding in a hotel or restaurant, while also stating that the licence of violating entity will be suspended. Could it be fatigue that has made people give up on wearing masks? “I know, a year is a long time but what option do we have? By the time we finish vaccinating 134 crore people in India, it will be another year,” Mehndiratta said. Since the recent rise in new infections, patients needing hospitalisation has also gone up. While two weeks ago, the daily average of patients hospitalised would normally be eight to 12 cases, numbers are now doubling as Goa has been reporting over 100 cases a day. Mortalities have also gone up. In the last ten days, 12 people lost their lives to the deadly virus. Besides Panaji, Margao and Ponda - each having a caseload of over 100, there has been a steady rise in new infections reported at Vasco, Porvorim, Mapusa, Chimbel, Siolim, Cansaulim, Cortalim health centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/a-year-on-state-yet-to-learn-from-mistakes/articleshow/81696784.cms||Bindiya Chari
---||Ahmedabad||HC verdict on stay of probe panel report on Mar 30||Ahmedabad: The division bench headed by Chief Justice Vikram Nath in the Gujarat high court on Thursday completed hearing and reserved its order till March 30 on the single-judge bench’s interim order staying the Justice (retd) D A Mehta Commission from submitting its inquiry report on fires at two Covid-19 hospitals, in Ahmedabad and Rajkot. On March 19, a single-judge bench stayed submission of the final report in response to a petition filed by relatives of the victims of the Shrey Hospital fire. They expressed apprehension that the probe panel may submit its report without affording them the opportunity to cross-examine others and gather and place evidence before it. The state government filed an appeal against the interim stay and argued that the relatives of the victim were not in the category of witnesses, who the commission should grant the permissions demanded. It was argued that relatives of the victims were creating a roadblock in the submission of the report, which the probe panel was to give by March 20-21, because the assembly session is under way, the advocate general told HC. During the arguments, the relatives’ counsel claimed that the constitution of the Justice Mehta Commission was illegal because it was a replacement or substitution of the earlier sole member of the commission, Justice (retd) K A Puj. The advocate general said Justice Shah had resigned after expressing a desire for it following the SC giving a dressing down to the state government for the sluggish pace of the process. The petitioners’ advocate argued that there was no need to supersede the earlier notification, which would obviously contain a recital of the resignation. He then alleged that the way Justice Puj quit the commission could be compared with substitution only. He questioned, “Was the resignation the effect of the fact that senior law officer of the country representing the state submitted in the Supreme Court that we are going to get rid of him. No person of self-respect would then stick on. On December 9, it was recorded before the SC that the solicitor general said that we are putting Justice D A Mehta in his place. Which person would sit there waiting to be sacked. The resignation of December 10 is the effect of the decision already taken to replace or supersede the earlier commission and to supplant one judicial officer by another.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-verdict-on-stay-of-probe-panel-report-on-mar-30/articleshow/81695050.cms||---

The one or two cinema halls like Bharat Talkies or Jyoti Talkies, which opened up after Deewali, either closed down later or had been showing dubbed south-Indian films or little-known English films. The situation of multiplexes in operation is no different. President of Bhopal Cine Association, Deepak Simhal, said, “Cinema halls have no new films to show to the spectators. One or two films, which released after the lockdown, were flops. The cinema business has been in doldrums ever since the lockdown. We are looking forward to the release of Suryavansham on April 2, but its release may also get delayed due to resurgence of Coronavirus in several states in the country”, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/cinema-halls-to-stay-shut-in-bhopal/articleshow/81695042.cms||---

With Naik being a popular face and coming from a tribal background, the BJP has taken note of him. Although several names were considered for the bypoll, the party has shortlisted three names—Sucharita Reddy, who was BJP’s candidate in 2018 assembly elections, Kadari Anjayya Yadav and Ravi Naik. After returning from a trip to Delhi on Thursday, state BJP chief Bandi Sanjay Kumar reportedly sought directions from the top brass on the selection of the candidate. However, the party is said to be exercising caution and is waiting for the TRS to announce its candidate first, but the caste equations may prompt the BJP to announce Ravi Naik as its candidate.

---||Surat||Coronavirus catching them young in Surat||SURAT: The latest Covid-19 wave that swept the diamond city has not spared the young. According to Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) officials, the data of infected people from February 1 to March 25 reveals that the largest number of infected people are in the age group of 31 to 40 years followed by 41 to 50 years of age. The highest infected age group since the pandemic began last year is 41 to 50 years of age followed by 31 to 40 years of age group. But in the latest trend, the 31 to 40 age group is leading the infection chart. When it comes to Covid-19 deaths, the 31 to 40 years age group accounts for 4.33% of the total death toll since the beginning of Covid-19 in the city. Civic body officials say that, unlike previous Covid-19 wave, wherein Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI) were the symptoms of Covid-19, symptoms have changed significantly and cases show that most of the young people in the working-age group are found positive and were completely asymptomatic. "This is a worrisome trend for the management of Covid-19 as younger people come into contact with a large number of people in their professional circles or businesses. This time around, there was no lockdown and, unfortunately, people are no longer afraid of a Covid-19 infection,'' said an official. "In the last three days, two Covid-19 patients below the age of 40 succumbed to the virus and this reflects on the seriousness of the new Covid-19 strain. The viral load is very high and it is very infectious. A few days ago, we conducted Covid-19 tests of around 300 students of which as many as 120 students tested positive,'' an SMC official added. "In some cases, we have observed that lung involvement gets serious if proper care or early hospitalisation is not done. In one case, a patient died within 24 hours of hospitalisation,'' an official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/coronavirus-catching-them-young-in-diamond-city/articleshow/81695060.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Vax doses given in Mumbai hits a million, BMC targets 1L/day||MUMBAI: Maharashtra finally has something to cheer about. It became the first state to administer over 5 million Covid-19 vaccine shots on Thursday. The state accounts for 9% of the 5.31crore doses administered in the country, the highest among states, since the drive began on January 16. Mumbai, too, reached a landmark of one million vaccinations on Thursday. The city accounts for one-fifth of the doses given in the state—Maharashtra has completed 50,14,774 while Mumbai has had 10,08,323 shots. “Maharashtra is at the top of the country in number of Covid vaccine doses administered, we are also the first to cross 5 million doses. We will scale up vaccination further,” said principal health secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas. Mumbai civic commissioner IS Chahal echoed the sentiment saying daily shots would be raised to 1lakh. Mumbai has seen a decline in daily footfalls while the state’s turnout drops every few days. With the Centre green-lighting 21 more private hospitals to join the immunisation drive, numbers may get a leg-up, BMC said. Of the 50lakh jabs administered, senior citizens account for over 22.29lakh. Next come the 9.40lakh healthcare workers who have taken the first dose and the 4.52lakh who have had both. Among frontline workers, 7.14lakh have taken one dose and 2.14lakh have taken both. Those above 45 years who have taken their first dose has crossed five lakh. In Mumbai, nearly five lakh senior citizens have taken the vaccine. BKC’s jumbo vaccination centre is the first one in Mumbai to cross one lakh inoculations. Dean Dr Rajesh Dere said it may be the only one in the country vaccinating up to 5,000 people in a day. The centre has come a long way from the chaotic scenes early on in the drive when hundreds thronged the venue and jostled for vaccines. “Now, the registration and most other processes have been moved indoors,” Dere said. Nesco jumbo centre in Goregaon is a close second with over 63,000 shots dispensed. Other centres performing well are Rajawadi and Babasaheb Ambedkar in Kandivli, both of which are soon going to start double shifts. Dr Dilip Patil, state’s immunisation officer, said 91% of registered healthcare workers and 81% of frontline workers have had at least one dose. “Numbers are picking up in rest of the categories,” he said. A member of the task force, however, said that even now less than 5% of priority groups (6.67lakh out of 1.77 crore) have had both doses. Maharashtra’s total population is estimated at over 12 crore. “There is no denying that it is no mean task to vaccinate over 50lakh in 2 months, but given the rise of cases seen in the second wave, vaccination has to pick up pace,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/vax-doses-given-in-mumbai-hits-a-million-bmc-targets-1l/day/articleshow/81695851.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Thakur was directed by the ministry of home affairs to take an exit from Indian Police Services through the voluntary retirement scheme. Soon after the announcement by the state government, Thakur had tweeted in Hindi, saying, “I have received my retirement orders. The government does not need my service, Jai Hind.” Thakur also shared the picture of the new nameplate on social media. He also wrote to mediapersons that since he was forced to retire arbitrarily, he would use these words for himself from now on. In 2016, Thakur had written twice to the Union home ministry, seeking a change in his cadre. The officer had also alleged that UP government officials were treating him as a “sworn enemy” and had cited threat to his life. He had expressed his inability to continue working in the prevailing conditions and demanded that he be shifted out of the state. The Centre in January 2017 had turned down his request. Thakur was also suspended on July 13, 2015, days after he had accused the then Samajwadi Party supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav of threatening him. He had made public an audio recording in which the SP leader allegedly threatened him. Thereafter, the state government had initiated a vigilance inquiry against him. Later, the Lucknow bench of the Central Administrative Tribunal stayed the suspension and ordered his reinstatement with full salary with effect from October 11, 2015. Thereafter, Thakur was posted as IG/joint director (civil defence) on May 17, 2018. He served in that capacity till his retirement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ips-officer-who-was-given-vrs-puts-up-nameplate-saying-jabariya-retired/articleshow/81696555.cms||---
---||Goa||In last 5 years, only 3.4% drug cases ended in conviction||Panaji: The state government said that it has been able to secure convictions in only 3.4% of narcotics cases in the past five years, and that the discrepancy in testimonies of panch witnesses often favour the accused. Goa police has arrested 911 persons in narcotics cases over the past five years, only 31 of whom have been convicted. This was revealed by chief minister Pramod Sawant in a written reply to the Assembly. Of these 911, some cases are still in trial, police said. The CM said that panch witness discrepancies are among the major reasons for acquittal by trial courts. “During the trial, the accused is given the benefit of the doubt in respect of any doubt created by the defence counsel regarding the deposition of any witness.” He also said there are “many other reasons” for acquittals, and they depend on the “facts and circumstances of each case”. Sawant said that whenever any adverse remarks or strictures are passed against investigating officers in judgments, the findings are submitted to their superior officer for action. “The reasons for acquittal are scrutinized by superior officers,” said Sawant. “If there is any malpractice on the part of investigating officer, action is taken against him as per service rules,” he said. “The investigating officers are periodically imparted training/briefed by senior officers for conducting successful prosecution of NDPS cases.” Sawant said that the NDPS Act provides stringent punishment to offenders violating its provisions, and hence prosecution is required to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. Last year saw fewer narcotic cases in the state, but the quantity of drugs seized was more than 80% higher than 2019, Goa police said. As per police statistics, over 85kg of narcotic substances were seized in 2019, compared to over 146kg in 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-last-5-years-only-3-4-drug-cases-ended-in-conviction/articleshow/81696827.cms||Murari Shetye

The result was part of the paper ‘Population based Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 Specific IgG Antibodies in Rural Ahmedabad – A Case Control Study’ by DDO (Ahmedabad) Arun Mahesh Babu and Deputy CDHO (Ahmedabad) Shilpa Yadav. It was published in International Journal of Science and Research (IJSR) recently. The survey carried out in December included patients who tested positive in July, August, and September, relatives of the confirmed positive patients, and general population (RT-PCR negative). “There is no statistically significant difference between men and women in terms of seropositivity. Analysis of area-wise cases show that the concentration is more around areas close to urban pockets,” said the DDO. He added that they wish to convey to people of the district that ‘herd immunity’ has not been achieved yet, and following Covid-19 safety protocols and getting vaccinated is the way forward to ensure safety of self and others. Dr Shilpa Yadav said that 46% of those who had recovered from Covid-19 infection were found to have antibodies. “Respective seropositivity surveys have revealed that the community is not developing immunity against corona,” said a top AMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/herd-immunity-elusive-reveal-surveys/articleshow/81695055.cms||Parth Shastri

Additional solicitor-general of India R Shankaranarayanan made the submission before Justice B Pugalenthi in response to a plea moved by a student seeking a direction to the Union government to approve the proposal. Pointing to a similar law enacted by Tamil Nadu, the ASG said, the legislation enacted by TN to provide 7.5% reservation in medical courses to students from government schools was enacted by the state itself and no reference was made to the Centre. Opposing the submission, senior advocate P Wilson, appearing for the petitioner, submitted that the central government’s stand would sound a death-knell to welfare of students studying in government schools. “The stand taken by the Centre is against the legislative power of a state under List III and is against the constitutional bench decision of judgment of the Supreme Court which has approved such in-service-reservations,” Wilson said. He added that the said power to grant in-service reservations is permitted for a state in the interest of welfare of the students and the central government cannot term it as illegal. Terming it as an unfortunate decision, the senior advocate said it went against the concept of social justice and judgment of the Supreme Court. Recording the submissions, the court adjourned the hearing to first week of April.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/puducherry/centre-no-to-10-pondy-neet-quota-for-govt-kids/articleshow/81695051.cms||---
---||India||SC: Structures of our society created by males & for males||NEW DELHI: In a landmark decision, the Supreme Court on Thursday allowed the pleas of women Short Service Commission officers to be fairly evaluated for permanent commission and quashed application of fitness standards of a 35-year-old male officer to women now in the 45-50 age group. The bench noted that the structure of our society is created by males for males where talk of equality is a farce. The women officers had first moved the Delhi high court in 2003 seeking permanent commission, which was allowed by the court in non-combat units in 2010. On February 17, 2020, the SC upheld the verdict and asked the Army to grant PC to women SSC officers. However, 86 women officers were back in the SC alleging arbitrary rejection by retrospective application of standards. In a heart-warming, 137-page judgment studded with analysis of various kinds of discrimination faced by women, a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah said, "The evaluation criteria set by the Army constituted systemic discrimination against the petitioners." The pattern of evaluation deployed by the Army to implement the decision in Babita Puniya (February 17, 2020) disproportionately affects women. Authoring the judgment, Justice Chandrachud said, “This disproportionate impact is attributable to the structural discrimination against women, by dint of which the facially neutral criteria of selective ACR evaluation and fulfilling the medical criteria to be in Shape-1 at a belated stage to secure PC disproportionately impacts them vis-a-vis their male counterparts. Times ViewThe Supreme Court’s decision is a milestone in the nation’s larger quest for gender equality. Women’s inclusion in the Army isn’t about tokenism; it is something that needs to be carried out in letter and spirit. The judgment must be celebrated by every progressive Indian.“The pattern of evaluation, by excluding subsequent achievements of the petitioners, and failing to account for the inherent patterns of discrimination that were produced as a consequence of casual grading and skewed incentive structures, has resulted in indirect and systemic discrimination. This discrimination has caused an economic and psychological harm and an affront to their dignity.” Read Also‘They’re drops in ocean of contribution by women’The Supreme Court on Thursday listed 26 outstanding women Army officers who broke the glass ceiling but ran into an insurmountable “structure created by males for males” in the Army to get disqualified for permanent commission (PC). A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah said, “Even womenThe SC said it would be in the spirit of true equality to apply the fitness standards of male counterparts to women SSC officers in the same age group and not make women officers who are in their 20th year of service to show fitness akin to the 10th year of service in the Army. The SC said even in selection level posts for male Army officers, the fitness levels are much relaxed. “Accordingly, the Army authorities must remove the requirement of benchmarking women Short Service Commission officers (WSSCOs) with the last male officer who had received PC in their corresponding batches and all WSSCOs meeting the 60% cutoff must be granted PC. Additionally, the calculation of the cutoff at 60%, which must by Army orders and instructions be reviewed every two years, must be re-assessed to determine if the casual completion of their ACRs is disproportionately impacting the WSSCOs ability to qualify for PC even at that threshold,” the SC said. “In light of the systemic discrimination that women have faced in the Army over a period of time, to call for the adoption of a pattern of evaluation that accounts and compensates for this harsh reality is not to ask for ‘special and unjustified treatment’. Rather, it is the only pathway for the attainment of substantive equality. To adopt a symmetrical concept of equality is to empty the anti-discrimination guarantee under Article 15 of all meaning,” Justice Chandrachud said. The SC said WSSCOs who have been excluded on medical grounds in November 2020 have a legitimate grievance that whether they fulfilled the Shape-1 criteria has to be determined from their medical status on the date when they were entitled to be considered, following the decision of the Delhi HC in 2010. “Some of them who fulfilled the criterion at the material time are entitled to PC and can continue in service so long as they continue to meet the medical standards prescribed for continuance in the Army,” the bench said. Blaming the Army for the simmering controversy over grant of PC to women officers, the SC said it arose only because of the Army not having implemented its decision in time, despite the course correction prescribed by the Delhi HC in 2010.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-structures-of-our-society-created-by-males-for-males/articleshow/81698096.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Constable Shrikant Deshpande, 35, was felicitated by the police commissioner on Thursday. This is the second time Deshpande has rescued a woman threatening suicide in his decade-long career. On March 20, Deshpande was patrolling when the control room informed of a distress call from Malad’s Chincholi area. A 32-year-old homemaker had climbed the overhead water tank of a four-storey building with the intention of leaping off after a heated argument with her husband. “I was connected to her husband over phone and he sounded very anxious. He had followed her to the terrace and was pleading with her to step down,” said Deshpande. The police vehicle reached the society at 4.05pm, within minutes of the call. Spotting the vehicle, the woman was further enraged. “Her husband told us she was furious that he had dialled the cops and threatened to kill herself right away. He forbade me from coming upstairs and requested that the fire brigade be summoned. But I promised I would save her. My only advice to him was to keep his wife busy in conversation while not disconnecting his call to me,” said Deshpande. The constable ran up the four floors only to realise he was on the wrong terrace. “I ran down and climbed the correct wing,” said Deshpande. He slipped on to the terrace unseen and hid under the water tank briefly. While she was distracted talking to her husband and went to look down at the ground, the cop climbed up the tank and pulled her back. With her husband’s help, he brought her down to safety. A labourer working in a school nearby filmed the incident. The video clip was tweeted by home minister Anil Deshmukh, lauding Deshpande. In April last year, Deshpande, who lives in south Mumbai, was going to work on his motorcycle when he spotted a woman hanging from a speed sign on the JJ flyover. He halted and tried to convince her to come down but she paid no heed and instead hurled expletives at him. Deshpande dialled the control room for help while waiting with her. Police vehicles arrived and she was brought down. The woman had been depressed with domestic issues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cop-rescues-homemaker-threatening-to-jump-off-bldg/articleshow/81695861.cms||Nitasha Natu

The saffron party has promised to set up a turmeric board in Tamil Nadu in its election manifesto. The farmers demanded BJP MP D Arvind’s resignation and questioned the dual stand of BJP on turmeric board. On March 15, the Centre in Parliament had clarified that there was no proposal to set up turmeric board in Telangana. Replying to a question raised by TRS MP KR Suresh Reddy in the Rajya Sabha, Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar said the Union ministry of commerce and industry had already established a regional office-cum-extension centre of spices board in Nizamabad for export promotion of spices, including turmeric. Turmeric is one of the important spice crops in the country with production of 11.53 lakh tonnes, which accounts for 78% of total turmeric production in the world. Telangana is the largest producer of turmeric with 3.86 lakh tonnes and has a cultivation area of 1.37 lakh acres. The erstwhile Nizamabad district is one of the biggest turmeric trade centres in Telangana. In the run-up to the 2019 general election, BJP candidate Arvind had given a written promise on a bond paper that he would convince the Centre to set up the turmeric board in Nizamabad if he was elected as MP and won the seat. However, the promise remained unfulfilled and protests by turmeric farmers were being carried out since then.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/turmeric-board-nzb-farmers-want-mp-arvind-to-resign/articleshow/81695073.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: State govt’s highest award for ‘voice of youth’, Asha Bhosle||MUMBAI: Asha Bhosle, who sashayed through the 1950s and ’60s with her peppy, toe-tapping numbers and became the voice of the youth in the sizzling 1970s with her psychedelic numbers such as ‘Chura liya hai tumne joh dil ko’ and ‘Dum Maro Dum’, was chosen for Maharashtra Bhushan, the state government’s highest award to recognise contribution to public life. A formal announcement was made on Thursday. Instituted in 1996, the award carries a cash prize and a citation. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray conveyed the news to the legendary playback singer over the phone, it is learnt. Bhosle, who is camping at her Lonavala bungalow to avoid Covid-19, thanked, in a tweet, the state government and people of Maharashtra for the highest honour. Rachana Shah, writer and daughter of Bhosle’s elder sister Meena Khadikar, shared a beautiful anecdote about her illustrious aunt. “Way back in the 1990s I joined Ushamavshi’s (noted singer and Lata-Asha’s sister Usha Mangeshkar) Mauritius concert. I was to sing Ashamavshi’s ‘Dum Maro Dum’. Before we left Mumbai for Mauritius, I went to Ashamavshi to gather a few tips on the iconic R D Burman number.” Bhosle told Shah, “This is a powerful number big orchestra and a paraphernalia of instruments. See that your voice doesn’t melt in the ocean of sound. Keep pace with the instruments.” Her parting shot was: “Aatoon gaa (Sing from within your heart).” Bhosle’s ouvre is formidable, say experts. Under the baton of greats such as O P Nayyar, S D Burman, Shankar-Jaikishan, R D Burman and her brother Pandit Hridayanath Mangeshkar, Bhosle’s meluflous voice has woven a tapestry of moods: Bhajan, qawwali, mujra-cabaret songs, peppy duets, soulful ditties, and Marathi natya geet and bhaav geet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-state-govts-highest-award-for-voice-of-youth-asha-bhosle/articleshow/81696635.cms||Ambarish Mishra

On Thursday morning, there were co-ordination issues between Western Railway and the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) health teams on the process to be followed for conducting RT-PCR tests on Maharashtra passengers, isolating them and following up if they returned positive. One challenge AMC health teams faced at the railway station was identifying Maharashtra passengers amid trains coming from Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Karnataka. “There are nearly 4,000 to 5,000 passengers coming into the city from these states, how does one identify those from Maharashtra, demand RT-PCR reports and conduct tests,” said a senior AMC official. Another issue that caused friction among the two agencies was the AMC’s insistence on allowing private Covid testing labs to conduct tests within the railway premises. Just 36 RT-PCR test kits were provided to health team in the morning at the station. “We provided contacts of private laboratories who should be conducting RT-PCR tests at subsidised rates of Rs 500. The railways has to allow them to set up a centre and isolate and follow up with patients who test positive,” said a senior AMC official. At the airport, passengers from Maharashtra were screened at the arrivals area of the domestic terminal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hiccups-in-testing-maha-passengers-at-kalupur-stn/articleshow/81695089.cms||---
---||Thane||Rising count linked to spike in testing: Maharashtra does 1.5L per day, Mum 47K||MUMBAI: Officials said the spiralling daily count in the state is linked to the sharp increase in tests per day. Maharashtra carried out over 1.5 lakh tests on Thursday, while Mumbai did 47,000 (of these 21,858 were rapid antigen tests).  On the flipside, higher detections resulted in a significant drop in doubling rate of Covid-19 cases in the state – it fell from 566 on January 31 to 194 on February 28 to 63 days on March 23. A state official said with doubling rate dropping, infrastructure including beds and drug stocks would have to be beefed up. Officials say local trains still running packed could be one of the reasons for the spike in the region.  However, BMC chief Chahal injected a dose of optimism saying there was no cause for panic as the BMC is in “full control of the situation.” He said the administration would increase the number of beds available in the city for Covid treatment from 13,773 to 21,000 in the next fortnight. “Considering the adequate health infrastructure and extremely low mortality rate (200 deaths between February 10 and March 24, which is an average of 4.6 deaths per day and a mortality rate of 0.3% against total positive cases in the period), there is absolutely no cause for panic," said Chahal. Meanwhile, the Kalyan-Dombivli belt, for the fourth consecutive day, recorded its highest caseload—987—since the pandemic began. It also reported four deaths, taking the tally of Covid-19 patients to 73,839 and toll to 1,237. Thane saw its highest volume till date as 932 cases were registered while no death was reported. Navi Mumbai reported 681 positive cases, taking total count to 61,676. Panvel reported 358 cases, taking total caseload to 33,938. Overall, the state has seen 26 lakh cases and 53,795 deaths.

But behind every step the cancer survivor takes is a story of grit and perseverance. When she was just a year old, Abirami was diagnosed with cancer. That very day, her father, an IT professional, deserted her and her visually challenged mother. “My parents came to my rescue,” says Abirami’s mother Kasturi Priyadarshini. “We sold our properties and spent about Rs 20 lakh on Abirami’s treatment. For me Abirami is everything and I wanted to do everything in my power to save her.” During her chemotherapy, Abirami and her mother would visit a temple near their house. Abirami was four when she saw her first bharatanatyam performance there and her mother says she was mesmerised. “I told my mother I wanted to learn how to dance,” says Abirami. However, Abirami had to wait a year before she could start because she had to undergo treatment for her left hand, which got paralyzed during radiation. “She finally began learning dance at the age of 5, and even now, fights the pain in her limbs every time she moves,” says Kasturi, who is now employed in a bank. “Many parents don’t understand that if cancer is diagnosed early especially in children, it can be cured. We want more parents fighting this disease to draw inspiration from Abirami.” Abirami has also performed for the Kalam Books of Records by performing on a knife tray and won the Unique World Record “Longest Classical Dance Marathon by Cancer Affected Individual (Minor)”. She has performed in more than 50 events so far and says she dreams of a Guinness Record. Abirami performs at various temples, hospitals, universities, private events, and schools, the ones that mean the most to her, she says Abirami, are those at children’s hospitals. “I want every child to fight the disease. I was rejected by my own father after my diagnosis and I don’t want that to happen to any other child,” she says. A resident of Poonamallee in Chennai, Abirami studies at a private school, and though her treatment was completed five years ago she continues to battle the side effects such as skin patches, neck swelling, and partial paralysis of her left hand. “Another side effect of the radiation therapy is loss of memory,” says her dance teacher Ramani Suresh Kumar. “Sometimes Abirami forgets steps or lessons, but she more than makes up for it with her sincerity and rigorous practice. She is a gifted dancer and her story is truly inspirational,” she says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/fighting-cancer-pain-with-grace-poise/articleshow/81695096.cms||---

---||Dehradun||Amidst Covid threat residents celebrate traditional Baithaki Holi in Kumaon||NAINITAL: Even though the country will celebrate Holi next week, the Baithaki Holi celebrations across Kumaon have been going on for months. Baithaki Holi – which literally means "sitting Holi" – is being celebrated in hundreds of villages in Kumaon for almost 500 years. Locals say that even though the coronavirus pandemic has affected parts of the country, it has not dampened the enthusiasm for Baithaki Holi. “Yes, some of us are wearing masks and also using sanitisers. But, there is no lack of enthusiasm in the celebrations. Our neighbours are joining us and we are singing folk songs and dancing to the beats of dholaks and tunes of harmonium,” said Krishna Pant, a villager from Bageshwar district. Another Almora resident, Amit Singh Rana, said that this year, they are being a little extra cautious and making sure that not many people from outside join them. “Every year, many of our relatives from nearby villages and even several cities would join us, but now that the Covid cases are once again on the rise, we are being a bit cautious and only inviting neighbours,” he said. The Holi celebrations start on the first Sunday of the "Poush" month of the Hindu calendar, which falls between December and January. However, it is after Vasant Panchami that the revelry gets livelier. "Traditionally, a singer sits in the centre and initiates a song. The women sitting around him then take turns to sing it. While ‘bhakti’ remains the central theme, some songs may be in a lighter vein. The women follow it up with dance as well,” Rekha Joshi, another Almora resident, said. Historians trace the origin of Baithaki Holi to the Chand kings of Champawat. “These celebrations can be traced to the courts of Chand king — some five centuries ago. Even though most of the celebrations are about sitting in circles and singing devotional songs and songs of other genres, there are several other customs associated with the festival as well. One of the most important customs is called cheer bandhan where shreds of cloth are collected from houses in a village and tied to a twig. The twig is then protected from being stolen because if it is stolen, then this village cannot celebrate Holi unless it manages to steal one for itself,” said Ajay Singh Rawat, Nainital-based historian.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/amidst-covid-threat-residents-celebrate-traditional-baithaki-holi-in-kumaon/articleshow/81694190.cms||Prashant Jha

But despite an advisory from the health department to the North Goa district administration to declare it as a micro containment zone and seal its premises, the officials are yet to take any action. North Goa district collector Ajit Roy, who was prompt in declaring a housing complex at Salai in Porvorim a micro containment zone after a few cases were detected early on Thursday, did not respond to either calls or text and WhatsApp messages from TOI. On Thursday, Goa reported 189 fresh cases, its highest in three months, and with 31 new cases, the active tally of the Panaji urban health centre rose to 163. Dr Utkarsh Betodkar, the state epidemiologist and in-charge of the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP), had earlier in the day written to Roy advising him to declare the casino premises a micro containment zone and seal it, sources said. Last week, after some staff of a popular restaurant in the capital tested positive, Roy had declared it a micro containment zone and sealed its premises immediately. Health minister Vishwajit Rane had last week warned that strict action would be taken against hotels, restaurants and any place considered an entertainment zone if they are found not adhering to the Covid-19 protocols. He had also suggested that in view of the rising cases in the neighbouring states, Goa must also insist on a Covid negative certificate from all visitors. But chief minister Pramod Sawant ruled out any curbs or tests for visitors to Goa and has only urged the tourists and local population to follow all protocols and be vigilant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/31-offshore-casino-staff-test-positive-for-covid/articleshow/81696794.cms||Bindiya Chari

PSI Chandrasinh Parmar turned up and we handed over the accused to him. When we asked for an acknowledgement, they refused to give us any. Patel said that suspecting something fishy, the next day he went to the police station and sought details, but the police did not and abused him. He said he did not get a satisfactory reply and so wrote the commissioner. Bapunagar police inspector A P Gadhavi said that the accused was a juvenile and according to the Juvenile Justice Act, if the offence attracts less than seven years of imprisonment an FIR cannot be registered and hence the juvenile was allowed to go. There was nothing wrong in releasing the juvenile accused, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/thief-let-go-cops-say-he-was-a-juvenile/articleshow/81695099.cms||---

At present, the academic books are provided free only to the students from reserved categories but the minister has now asked the officials that students from other communities should also be benefitted under the welfare scheme. All students of up to Class VII are already provided with free academic books in state-run schools. Meanwhile, the department is also planning to implement the ‘One School One Campus’ policy in more than 1,300 state schools. The state, at present, has several campuses where more than one schools are being run. The department claims that the implementation of the policy will help the schools in using their resources more efficiently. In yet another significant development on the day, higher education minister Dhan Singh Rawat has advocated for the inclusion of mandatory certificate courses in disaster management for students of higher education institutions in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/provide-academic-books-for-free-to-students-from-all-communities-arvind-pandey/articleshow/81694238.cms||Mohammad Anab

Since 85% of restaurant business comes during the evening. be it with customers dining-in at eateries or through app-based delivery platforms. However, with curfew imposed, most fine-dine restaurants otherwise operating from 6pm to 11pm, are facing shrinking order volumes by at least 70% over the past five days, according to estimates by Food Entrepreneurs’ Alliance(FEA). “There are barely any footfalls during the evening time because most people don’t have dinner as early. Evening time brings in maximum business for restaurants and with curfew, this has taken a major hit. We were hopeful that the civic authorities would allow takeaways to operate ,but even that has been barred. This has impacted business severely at atime when operational costs are mounting,” said Rushad Jinwala, anAhmedabad-based restaurateur. Estimates of Food Entrepreneurs’ Alliance (FEA) in Ahmedabad suggest that at least 60,000 deliveries a day were recorded till February 2021. But now, the figures have once again taken a hit with the curfew timings preponed. Rohit Khanna, co-founder, FEA, said, “With rising cases, the fear factor has once again started to impact business of restaurants which is driven by sentiments. We’re dealing with the pandemic since a year and the government must come up with a solution to tackle it in a way that businesses can smoothly function. The least we expect is allowing restaurants to run takeaways till 11pm.” Restaurateurs are reeling under hefty operating costs including property rents, commission paid to the app-based food delivery platforms, municipal tax, staff salaries and electricity bill. “Even if takeaways are allowed, the restaurant industry will at least survive well and be able to meet some operating costs,” said Narendra Somani, president, Hotels and Restaurants’ Association (HRA) – Gujarat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/early-curfew-takes-70-bite-out-of-food-orders/articleshow/81695103.cms||Niyati Parikh

---||Delhi||Amid rise of new variants, govt to study virus DNA||New Delhi: Samples of mild, moderate, severe and critical cases, besides re-infected Covid-19 patients and those who contracted the disease post vaccination, are going to be collected for whole genome sequencing. With nearly 70 cases of UK and South Africa variants of the novel coronavirus being detected in Delhi so far, Delhi government has asked the authorities in the 11 districts to collect samples from all types of patients so that the behaviour of the new variants can be analysed. The health department has defined the criteria under which the samples are to be collected and sent for genome sequencing to National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). Each district would be required to send three samples of mild, moderate, severe and critical cases every week for genome sequencing. This means 12 samples would have to be sent every week, apart from three of re-infection and three of post vaccination. “The district surveillance officers (DSO) have been directed to ensure identification of the cases according to the defined criteria and also ensure that the labs concerned send the identified samples for whole genome sequencing to NCDC. The DSOs have also been asked to ensure that a category-wise database is maintained in each district,” said a health department official. In the last six months, 69 Covid-19 patients have been confirmed positive for the new coronavirus strains. Mutations are not uncommon in viruses, but it is important to see whether they are significant enough to allow the virus to escape the immune mechanism and potentially affect vaccine efficacy. Though it is rare, vaccinated people can also get infected. Vaccination is being done on a large scale in Delhi and the authorities are keeping a watch on the possibility of infection among inoculated people. All districts have specifically been asked to collect samples of people who got two doses of the vaccine, but still became infected. Covid-19 cases are surging in the capital once again. The daily number touched 1,515 on Thursday after witnessing a rising trend for the past several days. The positivity rate has gone up from 0.3% early this month to 1.7%. The number of patients is rising both in institutional facilities as well as home isolation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/amid-rise-of-new-variants-govt-to-study-virus-dna/articleshow/81714750.cms||---

Chief minister Pramod Sawant said that he has made an allocation of Rs 2 crore in the budget for the exercise. The government’s focus on agriculture with a view to making the state self-reliant in the farming sector is evident in the budget with the government allocating Rs 489.19 crore for agriculture. The government is determined to bring 10,000ha of land under organic cultivation by forming 500 organic clusters. A provision of Rs 5.5 crore has been made in the budget for ‘sfurti clusters’ with a view to reviving traditional agricultural practices and produce. Rs 15 crore has been provided in the budget for providing minimum support price (MSP) for farmers, while Rs 24 crore has been allocated under the schemes ‘Plan to control price rise’ and ‘Shetkari aadhar nidhi’. The budget has proposed to set up 12 Farmer Producers Organisations, one each in every taluka, for crop production, post harvest management and marketing of agriculture produce. Two centres of excellence have also been proposed in the budget for cultivation of high value vegetables and flowers at government farms in Kalay (Sanguem taluka) and Codar (Ponda taluka). Sawant said that the government brought the functioning of the Sanjeevani sugar factory under the agriculture department in order to streamline its functioning, and that Rs 15 crore has been allocated in the budget to make it swayampurna.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/from-kunbi-saree-to-bebinca-govt-to-work-towards-gi-tag/articleshow/81678090.cms||---

These doctors were transferred to six different colleges where Medical Council of India’ (MCI) inspection was to be carried out for postgraduate courses. “The state health department, in its circular ordering the re-transfers, has clearly stated that these doctors who are professors and associate professors, should be transferred to the six colleges closer to the MCI inspection date,” said sources aware of the matter. Keeping in view the Covid-19 situation, the government had to re-transfer the doctors even as the MCI inspections in the six colleges including M P Shah Medical College (Jamnagar), government medical college (Bhavnagar), medical college (Vadodara), government medical college (Surat), GMERS Medical College (Vadnagar) and PDU Medical College (Rajkot) are still pending. The transfers were done to ensure that there was no reduction in postgraduate seats in the state. Officials said this was the common practice of the state government. Whenever any inspection looms, mass transfers take place, they said. Even during the inspection of undergraduate courses, the government authorizes mass transfers. Once inspections are over, the government sends the teachers back to their original postings after a year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/as-covid-rises-govt-to-shunt-b-j-medical-doctors-back/articleshow/81695113.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Jangalmahal high on the other ‘M’ factor||Jhargram: In the closely fought electoral battle in Jhargram, which is poised on the popularity of three Ms—Mamata, Modi and the Marxists—it is the heady magic of a fourth M, which is holding sway over its people. Mahua, the indigenous drink of Jangalmahal brewed from mahua flowers, seems the common thread binding everybody in Jhargram, be it the supporters of Trinamool or Modi or the Left, for its ubiquity, cultural connotations and flavour. The three main political parties are pulling out all the stops to lure voters with promises of development and doles, but the common man seems to be sceptical about the reality, unsure of the benefits out of the  results. Men and women seemed reluctant to talk about politics but queries on mahua elicited cheerful response. “Elections and politicians come and go but our lives and struggles continue the same way. It is mahua, which gives the extra push to help us get past our daily ordeals. We will have to vote and so, we will vote for the symbol our community leaders tell us to,” said Ranjit Bar, resident of Aguibil village in the forests of Binpur, even as he took a swig of the crystal-clear white mahua drink from a glass bottle. Once the hotbed of Maoist activities for over a decade, Jhargram has gradually evolved, showing signs of some development. Roads have been widened, water bodies dug up, fresh coats of paint put on mud huts and panchayat activities have resumed, even as peace and “normality” seems to have returned. But the lockdown last year to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus hit the already-impoverished residents of the region hard and that left them demoralized. At an adda over mahua in the forests of Mohanpur, around 15km from Jhargram town, peopled explain how. “The BJP government in the Centre imposed the lockdown and the police of the Trinamool Congress government would beat us up with batons if anyone stepped out to look for work so that we could earn some money to buy food. For the entire period of lockdown, we received only free rice from the government and nothing else. The CPM ruled for over 34 years but there was hardly any development. So, we no longer get excited about elections,” said Bir Tudu, a villager. “It’s the thought of a round of mahua that still manages to bring a smile amid all the hardship.” Jhargram’s population comprises several adivasi and non-adivasi communities, each with their unique culture and traditions. The forests of saal and segun are slowly growing popular among the urban population, who visit there for a few days of tranquillity. But all the boundaries within the local communities and with the outsiders seem to evaporate by the “spirit” of Jhargram, the mahua.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/jangalmahal-high-on-the-other-m-factor/articleshow/81695128.cms||Zeeshan Javed

---||Mumbai||Mumbai readies infrastructure to deal with 10,000 positive cases every day in city||MUMBAI: The BMC is bracing itself for 10,000 Covid-19 cases in a day and keeping medical infrastructure ready for it. Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal said case numbers were rising but there was no cause for panic. The BMC decided to raise Covid-19 beds from 13,773 on Thursday — 5,140 of these were vacant — to 21,000 in 15 days. This would be done by operationalising the pool of Covid beds in various hospitals. Assuming the city begins to add 10,000 cases per day with 15% of these symptomatic and in need of a hospital bed, then cosidering a 14-day cycle of bed occupancy, the number of beds required to handle the situation for a period six to eight weeks would be 21,000. Chahal said the BMC was in total control of the pandemic situation. “The BMC is confident of controlling the pandemic in due course of time,” he said. He said the BMC had resolved to take testing beyond 60,000 in the coming weeks. He said the BMC had completed 10 lakh vaccinations and aimed to increase the rate to a lakh per day. Chahal said people should follow Covid-appropriate behaviour and help the BMC. Chahal said that on Tuesday 40,400 tests were conducted and 5,458 of these showed up positive, a 13.5% positivity rate. He said that 83% were asymptomatic positive and that there were 10 deaths. On Wednesday, the BMC conducted 47,000 tests and the number of new cases remained over 5,000. The positivity rate was 12% and the percentage of asymptomatic positives, 84%. Six people died. In the second Covid-19 surge from February 10, there have been 200 deaths till Wednesday, an average of 4.6 deaths per day and a mortality rate of 0.3%. “Considering the adequate health infrastructure and extremely low mortality rate, there is absolutely no cause for panic or worry in Mumbai,” Chahal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bmc-readies-infra-to-deal-with-10000-positive-cases-every-day-in-mumbai/articleshow/81695915.cms||Richa Pinto

However, sheer high number of patients needing hospitalization still makes it appear too little to meet the rising demand. On Thursday, the city had 3,792 patients admitted in 85 government and private hospitals as per civil surgeon data. The city has 4,451 beds. By evening, the city had 494 beds vacant as per NMC data. The difference of 165 beds has been attributed to different reporting times. The NMC has added 17 hospitals in last one week to tackle the bed shortage. Meanwhile, with 47 Covid-19 deaths in last 24 hours, the district registered the highest daily deaths in the recent surge on Thursday. Out of them, 33 deaths were reported from Nagpur city alone, while 10 were from Nagpur rural areas. Four serious patients from other states or divisions also died during treatment on Thursday. Nagpur’s death toll has now reached 4,784.

Nagpur’s total Covid-19 case load reached 2,07,067. Only 2,098 patients recovered in the day, taking total number of recovered to 1,65,179. Recovery rate of Nagpur district further declined to 80.8%. Now, 34,819 patients are under treatment. Out of them, 26,760 are under home isolation, which accounts for more than 76% of total under-treatment patients. The data released by the NMC showed plenty of bed availability up to 10am and at 5pm. Around 900 beds were available a day earlier, 600 on Wednesday and 500 on Thursday morning. Yet, when citizens called up NMC helpline they only get the dreadful reply ‘bed nahi hai’. TOI too tried to cross check the claims on Wednesday night, when this correspondent received numerous calls about shortage of beds again, and found them to be correct. The NMC helpline asked all callers to wait till morning 10am, when the fresh list will be generated. When TOI asked medical colleges and private hospitals, they said as soon as the list is made available, the beds get occupied in less than an hour. This is also because many non-Covid patients too are testing positive.

We are trying to match the speed. As of now, it is not that we have reached the limit but we are left with only small hospitals. All big ones have been converted into Covid hospitals. We are in touch with all hospitals,” he said. Sharma said small hospitals have issues as some might be maternity or eye or nursing homes. “It takes time to convert them. We are getting good support from private hospitals. Existing Covid hospitals are also increasing their bed strength,” he said. Sharma said NMC squads would keep a tight watch on hospitals and pay a surprise visit to see no patient with mild symptoms has been admitted.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: In kids’ interest to stay in India, HC tells US mother||Mumbai: Observing that the best interest of the child is paramount in a matrimonial dispute, the Bombay high court dismissed a US-based woman’s petition against her husband staying in Mumbai with their two children after having brought them to India for a two-week holiday in August 2018. The estranged couple, who had married in Gujarat in 2001 under the Parsi Zoroastrian rights, has divorce and custody litigation pending in the US and India. The man filed for divorce under the Parsi matrimonial court in 2018. The court, however, allowed the woman access to the children, now 17 and 15, through video every weekend. It clarified its ruling will have no bearing on the divorce and custodyproceedings. A US court had granted shared custody in November 2018 and in August next year rejected the husband’s objection to its jurisdiction. A court in India had in April 2018 restrained the wife from proceeding with her divorce plea before the US court. A bench of Justices S S Shinde and Manish Pitale said the husband’s objection might have been rejected by a US court, but the Bombay HC “cannot ignore” what would be in the “best interest of the children” and has a duty as parens patriae (legal protector of citizens unable to protect themselves). “In such acrimonious matrimonial disputes, it is found that the children are victims of circumstances,” said the HC. “It is significant that when the children can be said to have developed roots in the country where they have been brought, it becomes a relevant factor for determining what would be in their interest,” said the HC. When the children are close to turning adults, their desire on where they wish to stay is relevant too, the court added, after hearing submissions by Amir Arsiwala for the woman and Anoshak Daver with Mac Bodhanwalla for the man. The woman had filed a habeas corpus petition to produce her children. She claimed her husband had defied the shared custody consent order of the US court and, hence, they should return to the US to participate in pending proceedings there. The fact that the petitioner was the mother “cannot alone be a factor for passing an order in her favour”, said the court, adding that it was not persuaded to hold that the children were in “illegal custody” of their father. The judges, after interacting with both children, said they were “emphatic that they desired to live with their father”. “The desire of the daughters to continue to live with their father in India cannot be completely ignored when this court is called upon to decide as to what would be in their best interest,’’ said the HC, but granted the mother “access through video conferencing” to the children every Saturday and Sunday for an hour each. The HC said the couple “may mutually agree on further details of such visitation rights…including during school holidays”. If she visits India, the estranged husband shall arrange for her stay for two weeks and allow her to meet the children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-in-kids-interest-to-stay-in-india-hc-tells-us-mother/articleshow/81695928.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan college of arts students detained by police for protesting||JAIPUR: The tussle between the administration of Rajasthan School of Arts and students grew bitter on Thursday when six students were detained by police. College students have been on strike since last one week against non-appointment of quality teachers and vacant posts in the college. On Thursday, police were called and six students including one girl was detained. They were released later after the entire batch of college students went to the police station. Makhan Singh Gurjar, former student leader of the college, said the college administration is not up to the mark and teachers not having professional degrees are appointed. “We need teachers of professional degrees, but these teachers have MA in drawing and painting. Except three, other 15 seats of faculty members are vacant in the college,” said Makhan. The vacant posts are filled with the help of guest lecturers. This protest has been going on for a long time and students even asked for transfer certificate for the entire college. The issue between students and college administration has been going on for the last two years. In 2019, the issue was resolved after a compromise was reached between both the parties but it has again started. College education commissioner Sandesh Nayak said, “The three teachers posted in the college are as per UGC rules and are well qualified. Other permanent teachers will be appointed through by RPSC recruitment. It will be done when the government issues a notification.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-college-of-arts-students-detained-by-police-for-protesting/articleshow/81695121.cms||---

However, sheer high number of patients needing hospitalization still makes it appear too little to meet the rising demand. On Thursday, the city had 3,792 patients admitted in 85 government and private hospitals as per civil surgeon data. The city has 4,451 beds. By evening, the city had 494 beds vacant as per NMC data. The difference of 165 beds has been attributed to different reporting times. The NMC has added 17 hospitals in last one week to tackle the bed shortage. Meanwhile, with 47 Covid-19 deaths in last 24 hours, the district registered the highest daily deaths in the recent surge on Thursday. Out of them, 33 deaths were reported from Nagpur city alone, while 10 were from Nagpur rural areas. Four serious patients from other states or divisions also died during treatment on Thursday. Nagpur’s death toll has now reached 4,784.

Nagpur’s total Covid-19 case load reached 2,07,067. Only 2,098 patients recovered in the day, taking total number of recovered to 1,65,179. Recovery rate of Nagpur district further declined to 80.8%. Now, 34,819 patients are under treatment. Out of them, 26,760 are under home isolation, which accounts for more than 76% of total under-treatment patients. The data released by the NMC showed plenty of bed availability up to 10am and at 5pm. Around 900 beds were available a day earlier, 600 on Wednesday and 500 on Thursday morning. Yet, when citizens called up NMC helpline they only get the dreadful reply ‘bed nahi hai’. TOI too tried to cross check the claims on Wednesday night, when this correspondent received numerous calls about shortage of beds again, and found them to be correct. The NMC helpline asked all callers to wait till morning 10am, when the fresh list will be generated. When TOI asked medical colleges and private hospitals, they said as soon as the list is made available, the beds get occupied in less than an hour. This is also because many non-Covid patients too are testing positive.

We are trying to match the speed. As of now, it is not that we have reached the limit but we are left with only small hospitals. All big ones have been converted into Covid hospitals. We are in touch with all hospitals,” he said. Sharma said small hospitals have issues as some might be maternity or eye or nursing homes. “It takes time to convert them. We are getting good support from private hospitals. Existing Covid hospitals are also increasing their bed strength,” he said. Sharma said NMC squads would keep a tight watch on hospitals and pay a surprise visit to see no patient with mild symptoms has been admitted. As per norms, only moderate to severe Covid patients can be admitted.

---||Delhi||Class Act: Honours For 98 Teachers, Principals||New Delhi: Teachers who did not know how to use a smartphone had equipped themselves with the knowledge of how to use technology to teach students in online sessions after the Covid-19 outbreak. That is why deputy chief minister and education minister Manish Sisodia described them as the biggest contributors to nation-building. Lauding their tremendous effort, Delhi government felicitated 98 teachers and school principals on Friday. Addressing the teachers at the State Teachers Award ceremony at the Delhi Secretariat, Sisodia said, “We are here exactly a year after the lockdown was imposed. Our education system was badly hit by the pandemic and school closure left everyone clueless about the teaching-learning process. But our teachers and principals rose to the occasion and showed unparalleled grit and determination in responding to this unprecedented situation.” Of the educators felicitated, 69 were from Delhi government schools, 18 from private schools and 11 from the municipal corporation schools. The awardees comprised special educators, arts and music teachers, librarians, mentors, sports teachers and vocational teachers. Delhi Government also awarded 11 teachers and government officials for their commitment to executing semi-online teaching learning activities and Covid relief work. The state government also gave two special awards to teachers based on the observations of Deputy CM Manish Sisodia during his school visits. These went to Ajay Choudhary of Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya, Civil Lines, and Ashoshika Bharodia of Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya, Pocket-4, Mayur Vihar I. A government statement said, “Chaudhary showed zeal as he responded to queries of Class 12 students who would text him at 1.30 am in the night to solve complex questions and helped students qualify for prestigious exams of JEE and NEET. As for Bharodia, she reached out to her students in the challenging times of Covid-19 and organised sessions for students at their jhuggis in Chilla Khadar.” Speaking on the occasion, Sisodia observed that the teachers’ work underlined the fact that “learning never stops”. There’s still work ahead and teachers needed to rethink strategies regarding assessment, he said. “We need to build correct approaches and develop a 360-degree assessment system. The premise of rote learning evaluated at a year-end, three-hour exam is an injustice to students and teachers,” the deputy CM said. “The challenge is to eliminate rote-learning practices and this is why we are establishing the Delhi education board — to develop continuous and comprehensive assessment.” He also said that the government’s diverse approaches in education were not limited to building school infrastructure and ensuring good pass percentages, but also bringing in curricular changes. “We have introduced curricula in entrepreneurship mindset, happiness and deshbhakti,” said Sisodia. “For digital learning, we are in the process of establishing the first ever virtual school in the country based on the idea of anywhere living, anytime learning, anytime testing.” On his part, Udit Prakash, director of education, said that the “teachers are the pillars of our education model and have transcended the boundaries of learning and done splendid work, especially in these unprecedented times”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/class-act-honours-for-98-teachers-principals/articleshow/81714803.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Patna||Launch drive to nab liquor smugglers of big cities: CM||PATNA: Chief minister Nitish Kumar on Thursday asked the top officers of the state administration to maintain extra vigil during Holi festival and keep an eye on people consuming illicit liquor and those indulging in illegal trade of the banned commodity in the state. During a virtual review meeting on law and order and effective enforcement of the prohibition law in the state, the CM asked the senior officers to remain more alert during Holi this time as the festival of colours and Shab-e-Barat coincide with each other. “There is a need to keep strict surveillance on people who may create law and order problem. Such elements should be dealt sternly,” he said. Nitish told the officers to ensure arrest of those involved in illicit liquor smuggling. “There is a need to launch a special drive to arrest liquor mafias operating from big cities,” he said. “Nobody violating the prohibition law will be spared. It doesn’t matter how much powerful, influential or rich they are,” the CM told the officers. The CM pointed out that several schemes had been launched by the state government for the welfare and rehabilitation of economically backward people who were earlier engaged in liquor trade. He also directed the senior officers posted at the headquarters to seek reports on disposal of cases related to land disputes at the weekly review meetings at the police station, twice a month at the sub-division level and once at the district level. The CM opined that the regular meetings at the police station level, sub-division level and district headquarters will reduce incidents of crime. “Around 60% of the crime incidents are related to land and property disputes,” he said. Nitish said that the people of the state would get benefits of development works only when there was peace, tranquillity and communal harmony in the society. Earlier, ADGP (special branch) J S Gangwar, ADGP (law & order) Amit Kumar and IG (prohibition) Amrit Raj briefed the CM about the measures taken by respective branches of the state police force for maintenance of law and order and effective enforcement of prohibition law. Deepak Kumar, principal secretary to CM, S K Singhal, DGP, additional chief secretary, home, Chaitanya Prasad, principal secretary to CM Chanchal Kumar, secretary to CM Anupam Kumar, ADGP, CID, Vinay Kumar and state excise commissioner B K Dhanji were prominent among those present at the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/launch-drive-to-nab-liquor-smugglers-of-big-cities-cm/articleshow/81695171.cms||Ramashankar

The doctor urged people to stay away from offices, social gatherings and even vaccination for the next few days.

---||Patna||HC orders removal of doctor appointed ‘illegally’ in IGIMS||PATNA: The high court on Thursday ordered the removal of an assistant professor at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) here with the observation that "he has illegally been appointed by the selection committee (of the hospital)". The court further observed that the selection committee wrongly awarded him more marks than another applicant, paving the way for his appointment. The single bench of Justice Prabhat Kumar Jha ordered the appointment to be scrapped and another applicant, who was overlooked despite higher marks, to be appointed within three months. Petitioner Dr Pawan Kumar had filed a writ petition in 2018 seeking to quash the order of appointment of Dr Nishant Kashyap and Dr Chandan Kumar. In 2018, the IGIMS had issued an advertisement seeking the appointment of faculty members in various departments. The petitioner, too, had applied for the same. While the petitioner was called for an interview on July 3, 2018, results were published on September 19. However, despite having more experience and qualification, he was put on the waiting list. The selection committee of the IGIMS choose candidates based on 100 marks for different criteria. As per the result published by the IGIMS, the petitioner Dr Pawan got 52 marks, while Dr Kumar Chandan got 62 marks, and Dr Nishant Kashyup got 55 marks. It was found that Dr Nishant was given two marks for teaching experience, but as per the criteria set, he could secure only one mark. Even in the category of research publication, which consisted of 25 marks, he was awarded 15 marks even though he was entitled to 12 marks. Overall he was given 55 marks instead of 51. Similarly, Dr Chandan in the column meant for teaching and experience had stated he worked as a senior resident from May 3, 2014, to July 2, 2017. At one place, he mentioned he did DNB (ortho) in December 2014, and this showed that his experience of teaching did not appear to be correct. The court found that the committee had wrongly given him extra marks in different categories such as special training in spine, teaching experience and research and publication. The court observed that though he was entitled to get 46 marks he was illegally awarded 62 marks. On the other hand, the petitioner (Dr Pawan), who was entitled to 57 marks, was given 52 marks. The order read that since two vacancies are available, Dr Nishant has been rightly appointed, but the appointment of Dr Chandan cannot be sustained as he got fewer marks than that obtained by the petitioner and the former’s appointment is ‘fit to be set aside'. The court, thus, directed the IGIMS director and head of the orthopaedics department at the hospital to consider the case of appointment of Dr Pawan for appointment on the post of assistant professor (orthopaedics) within three months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/hc-orders-removal-of-doctor-appointed-illegally-in-igims/articleshow/81695123.cms||Sheezan Nezami

The girl told the police on Thursday that she was held captive by three youths -- Nitish Singh, Chandan Singh and Ramanuj Singh – when she had gone to a field to relieve herself around 5am on Wednesday.

Their demands include removal of restrictions on cycle from Kolkata streets and implementation of an infrastructure development plan to promote the cost efficient, safe and eco-friendly urban commute in the city. Satanjib Gupta , the Bicycle Mayor of Kolkata (BYCS), said: “Ban on cycle movement in Kolkata is affecting domestic workers, milkmen, newspaper delivery men, factory workers and others who cannot work from home and afford to pay for transport every day. They have to depend on cycle or walk for commute.”  Vinay Jaju, convenor of Bengal-CAN, said, “Politicians and cops say that cycle is banned in Kolkata because of its narrow streets. But small roads make cycle movement more relevant.

The chairman and vice-chairman of the society, whose office is on Nirmala Road, allegedly siphoned off at least Rs one crore of investors’ money. A complaint was against them in Gandhigram police station by Faisal Nageriya, a mobile shop owner, who lost nearly Rs one lakh in their investment scheme. Nageriya alleged in his complaint that credit society’s chairman Amit Jalu and vice-chairman Kishore Jalu, had cheated investors and siphoned of over Rs one crore of money invested by various investors. Amit and Kishore were booked under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code including cheating and criminal conspiracy among others. Both are absconding. A primary probe revealed that the credit society was operating for the past 10 years and its promoters had lured investors with a promise of higher interests rates on their deposits. Police sources said they had launched a daily saving deposit scheme as well as a monthly scheme were small-time traders engaged in fruits, vegetables dairy and other business could invest. They offered attractive interest rates, which lured these people to put in their savings.

Appearing before special judge Geetanjli Goel, senior advocate Vikas Pahwa argued, “Her relatives, friends and son have said that she was a strong woman and couldn’t have died by suicide. How can there be a question of abetment when she didn’t die by suicide? They (prosecution) have failed to prove suicide.” Pushkar was found dead on the evening of January 17, 2014. Though a murder probe was registered under IPC Section 302 (murder), police charged Tharoor on May 28 under IPC sections 306 (abetment of suicide) and 498A (cruelty by husband). Pahwa sought his client’s discharge in the case and argued that the prosecution had not alleged any mental or physical torture against his client. The counsel relied on several Supreme Court judgments to substantiate his arguments, one of which was on the point that even having an extramarital affair was not good enough a ground to amount to cruelty under IPC Section 498A. Earlier, it was argued that numerous reports of the medical board comprising renowned doctors, besides the forensic reports of various laboratories and the psychological autopsy report conducted by experts, had ruled out the death to be a homicide or suicide. According to the submissions, the same reports consider the death to be accidental. Pahwa argued that police in four years after a painstaking investigation could not even find the cause of Pushkar’s death. The court was also informed that in the present case, neither had anyone filed a complaint nor given any statement alleging cruelty against Pushkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/pushkars-kin-ruled-out-suicide-tharoor-defence-in-city-court/articleshow/81714868.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The single bench issued the order on a petition by Dharam Singh. The petitioner’s counsel Satish Khandelwal stated that the order was passed before issuing the permit under the Motor Vehicles Act, which can be challenged in the State Transport Appellate Tribunal. The tribunal refused to hear the petitioner Dharam Singh’s case saying there is no order that has been issued by the RTO for issuing permits. The petitioner was forced to approach the high court, pleading that corruption in RTO Dausa is neck deep and any person could obtain a permit by paying money. RTO Dausa did not pass any official order even though it is mandatory under law. The high court treated the matter seriously and asked the Commissioner of Transport, Jaipur, RTO Dausa to file a reply by April 8. REET hearing postponed to April 5 The high court has postponed the hearing on a petition challenging the conduct of REET on April 25 on Mahaveer Jayanti to April 5. The petition has been made by the All India Digambar Jain Teerth Kshetra Committee and Rajasthan Jain Sabha. The petition stated that the RBSE is going to conduct the REET on April 25.

---||Chandigarh||Controlling gangs will require Mcoca: Gupta at DGPs’ meet||Chandigarh: At the Punjab, Haryana, and Chandigarh police chiefs’ meeting in Panchkula on Thursday, Punjab DGP Dinkar Gupta called for a Mcoca (Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act) type law to contain the region’s gangsters. At this joint-strategy formulation to prevent murder, attempted murders, and extortion committed through these gangs, the director generals of police recalled instances where hardcore criminals had executed sensational crimes from jails. Recently, Sampat Nehra had directed a triple murder in Rajasthan from the Hoshiarpur prison and Rajiv Raja got country-made firearms from Madhya Pradesh delivered to him inside the Nabha jail. Lawrence Bishnoi plotted the killing of Youth Congress member Gurlal Singh in Faridkot from a jail in Rajasthan, from where he also makes extortion calls through his links in Canada and the UK. The three DGPs also expressed concern about loopholes in the Arms Act that allow gun running and the misuse of weapon license for the supply of ammunition to the criminals. Police intelligence suggests that Punjab gun houses deliver ammunition to illegal arms factories in Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh among other states. Since criminals fly abroad on fake passports, the cops will now identify their travel agent friends who make those documents. There will be a list of most wanted absconders and rewards for their information. The three police forces will use technology-aided real-time sharing of information and hold inter-state quarterly meeting for updates. Haryana DGP Manoj Yadava called for a coordination mechanism and a common database of organised gangs. DGP Gupta thanked his Haryana counterpart for the idea and for hosting the conference. Yadava also suggested the top brass to exchange their contact numbers for better coordination and tracking social media to find out foreign links and hideouts of the gangsters. The forces also exchanged the details of some inter-state gangs. For Haryana, DGP (crime) Mohammad Akil, ADGP (law and order) Navdeep Virk, Special Task Force inspector general Amitabh Dhillon, Panchkula police commissioner Saurabh Singh, and ADGP (internal security) R N Dhoke were present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/controlling-gangs-will-require-mcoca-gupta-at-dgps-meet/articleshow/81695930.cms||---

They advised the government to keep faith in deities of the valley, saying that they would “protect people from the pandemic.” They also asserted that they would not stop performing rituals and celebrating fairs and festivals. Kullu Zila Devi Devta Kardar Sangh president Jai Chand Thakur and general secretary Narayan Singh Chauhan on Thursday informed that they have requested chief minister and cabinet minister from Kullu, Govind Thakur to not intervene in temple-related ceremonies. They said most of the fairs and rituals will be held till May and should be performed at any cost. “We cooperated with the government last year when rituals in all temples remained suspended. We shall again cooperate as the government is taking strict action for people’s welfare and safety. People, including priests, kardars, musicians and followers of deities will use face mask and sanitisers while performing rituals,” Jai Chand said. He added that a few government officials “personally try to hinder the rituals, which upsets the Dev Samaj and should be stopped.” “There should not be any hindrance in fairs, festivals and religious ceremonies. The government should believe in deities and keep faith in them.” Following rise in the number of Covid-19 cases, Himachal government had imposed a ban on fairs from March 23 and restricted the maximum number of gatherings in both indoors and outdoors events.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/kullu-temple-bodies-ask-govt-to-stop-intervening-in-name-of-covid/articleshow/81695932.cms||---

The students are Kavya Chopra and Mridul Agrawal. Kavya Chopra is also the first female to secure 300 out of 300 marks in JEE Main. A resident of New Delhi, Chopra started her coaching in ALLEN Career Institute in Kota one year back. This was Kavya’s second attempt. “I had scored 99.97 percentile in JEE Main 2021 February attempt. But my target was to secure above 99.98 percentile, which was the reason for appearing in March 2021. In the first attempt, I focused more on physics and chemistry, yet I scored less in chemistry. Hence, I had to put more effort into chemistry for the next 15 days for March examination,” Chopra said. Chopra aims to pursue B.Tech from IIT Bombay. Being a bright student always, she passed Class X with 97.6%. While sharing her daily routine, Chopra said she devotes almost seven to eight hours to her studies daily and dedicates equal time to all three subjects. According to Chopra, the best atmosphere, best peer group and competition of Kota cannot be found anywhere in the country. So she decided to come to Kota to prepare for JEE. Mridul Agarwal, a resident of Jaipur, had also achieved 100 percentile in the February attempt but could not score a perfect 300. In order to improve his own score and prepare for JEE Advanced, he appeared again and managed to get right at the top. Agarwal has been preparing for the JEE Main examinations for the past three years from Allen Career Institute, Kota. He plans his studies well in advance. “I would make a target and makes it a point to finish the same on the decided time. Apart from the coaching, I also devoted about eight hours daily for self-study. In lockdown, I took online classes and studied from home,” said Agarwal. Mridul aspires to join IIT Bombay and become a software engineer. His father, Pradeep Agarwal, is an accounts manager in a private firm, and his mother, Pooja Agarwal, is a homemaker.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/300/300-marks-2-from-raj-hit-bulls-eye/articleshow/81695143.cms||---

The protest against inflation led by Safidon segment Congress MLA Subhash Gangoli started outside the court and ended within 300 metres with participants handing over a memorandum to the district administration. Meanwhile, observers Giriraj Singh and Anand Jakhad reached the party office to consider the name of the district president. They held a meeting with workers and took their suggestions, which will be submitted to Congress state president Kumari Selja. Talking to media persons, Congress MLA Subhash Gangoli alleged, “We organised the protest against inflation as common people are forced to suffer. The Modi government, which claimed to provide relief, has fallen flat as prices of almost everything have increased. People are being harassed in the absence of proper policies and the government is exploiting them. The Congress party will launch an agitation if price hike is not controlled. The Centre and state government both failed to meet people’s demands. The government has no concern with issues related to the public and is busy with vested interests.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/lukewarm-response-to-cong-procession-against-inflation/articleshow/81695939.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Making wild, unfounded allegations against spouse with employer is cruelty: High Court||NAGPUR: Upholding the family court’s decision to grant divorce to a woman, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court (HC) ruled that making wild and unsubstantiated allegations against one’s spouse at their workplace amounts to cruelty. While dismissing the Nagpurian husband’s plea, a division bench comprising justices Atul Chandurkar and Pushpa Ganediwala added that the husband’s conduct was intended to prejudice the wife's service. “It thus becomes clear that making unfounded allegations against one’s spouse or their relatives in the pleadings or making complaints with a view to affect their job amounts to causing mental cruelty,” the bench held. Asserting that the husband’s behaviour and his conduct of making wild and unsubstantiated allegations caused mental agony to the wife, the judges refused to interfere with Nagpur family court’s judgment. After entering into wedlock on April 27, 2008, the couple was blessed with a child on March 3, 2009. However, the husband’s family members started meting out ill-treatment to the wife. After taking all her gold jewellery, she was allegedly driven out of home. Subsequently, she moved family court for restitution of conjugal rights, but later withdrew the plea and applied for divorce on the grounds of cruelty and desertion. She contended that the husband tried to defame her in her office and among her relatives, saying she was suffering from epilepsy. According to the wife, the husband and in-laws abused her time and again, and there used to frequent quarrels between them. She was also forced to do all the household work and was thrashed on some occasions. After finding it unsafe to continue the relationship, she approached the family court, which granted her divorce on September 25, 2014. The husband challenged this decision in the HC, contending that except wear and tear of normal life, the wife failed to submit any substantial evidence to prove grounds of cruelty. He claimed her family members belonged to the ‘Rajput’ caste, but forged the caste certificate of ‘Rajput Bhamta’ for securing employment. Moreover, wife’s parents also kept him in the dark on her epilepsy disease, he contended. He said he had made various complaints to her office regarding her employment as a teacher, on the basis of a forged certificate. The HC ruled that the husband’s conduct of not initially pleading about wife’s epilepsy in a written statement and stating the same for the first time in his deposition, as well as making wild allegations that she and her relatives secured the false caste certificate without attempting to substantiate them caused mental agony to her. “In absence of any pleading by the husband on his allegations against the wife, there was no occasion for her to counter his charge that she was suffering from epilepsy. It thus remained an allegation raised for the first time in evidence but not proved,” the judges said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/making-wild-unfounded-allegations-against-spouse-with-employer-is-cruelty-hc/articleshow/81694336.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The tuskers kept strolling on the railway line, for nearly half-an-hour. After much effort, the forest department officials were able to send it back to the Rajaji Tiger Reserve. The episode not only triggered panic in the area but also delayed movement of a train. According to forest officials, the tusker had entered into the station from the Haridwar range of Rajaji Tiger Reserve via the Mansa Devi route. “The two tuskers didn't cause any inconvenience to the public and after an operation of about 25 minutes, we were able to push them back to the forests of Rajaji Tiger Reserve. The place from where they managed to enter the railway line has also been identified. Patrolling will be increased in the area to prevent any such incident in the future,” said Neeraj Verma, DFO, Haridwar Forest Division. A few days ago, a jumbo had entered Laalwala Taapu near Sarvanand Ghat in the Kumbh mela area from the Chilla forest area.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 4 post-vaccination deaths not linked to shots, says Panel||MUMBAI: An expert panel has reviewed four post-vaccination deaths in the city and concluded that all were “coincidental” and not be linked to the vaccines. Of the four dead, two were in their 60s. The other two were in their mid-50s, one of them a healthcare worker and one a policeman. Three of them had multiple co-morbidities. Called the adverse event following immunisation (AEFI) committee, the panel comprises 12-14 specialists from multiple branches. The committee recently met to discuss the death of the four people, some of whom had taken Covishield and some Covaxin. The first person to have died post-vaccination was the healthcare worker, who had a history of liver cirrhosis along with diabetes and hypertension. He had been hospitalised for days for his liver condition a month before vaccination. “The committee attributed the death to his many underlying health problems,” an official said. The second case reviewed was of a 65-year-old woman from Bandra who was found dead a day after vaccination. The AEFI committee found she had a brain aneurysm,which occurs when a weak spot in the brain’s arterial wall bulges and ruptures. It can cause death if not treated immediately. The third case was of 69-year-old retired businessman from Goregaon who collapsed on the chair within seconds of being administered the vaccine on March 8. A doctor said he had a history of heart ailments and it was most likely linked to that. The fourth case was of ACP Ramesh Nangre, who died two days after vaccination. Nangre’s death was attributed to a heart attack and not linked to the inoculation. Dr Sheela Jagtap, immunisation in-charge, said the deaths were “coincidental” and people should not worry about coming forth for vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-4-post-vaccination-deaths-not-linked-to-shots-says-panel/articleshow/81695970.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The state reported 715 new infections on Thursday, taking the overall tally to 3,27,890. The state’s toll stands at 2,808. The first day of making Covid negative report mandatory from all states saw teething problems. When a train arrived at Jaipur station, passengers got off and rushed to get out of the platform. When the health department’s team asked them for the mandatory Covid negative report, the situation almost got violent between passengers and health department’s team posted at the station. The health department immediately contacted the railway authorities and demanded General Railway Police security for the health team. A senior health department official said, “We need cooperation of different departments including railways and roadways and also airport authorities to ensure that passengers should not get entry in Rajasthan without the negative report as directed by the state government.” National Health Mission (mission director) has issued directions to airport authorities to ensure that passengers flying from other states and landing at Jaipur airport should get Covid negative report (RT-PCR) and it should be checked if they have it at the airport. Chief medical health officer (Jaipur-I) Dr Narrottam Sharma said, “We are taking samples of those travelers of other states and coming to Jaipur by train, bus or flights.” The health department is sending passengers who do not have negative report under home quarantine for 14 days. “We are providing free testing facilities at railway station and bus stand. At railway station, 535 passengers without Covid-19 negative report have been asked to remain under quarantine. If they test negative, they can go out of quarantine. At Sindhi Camp bus stand, 180 samples were taken of those who were not carrying Covid negative report,” said Dr Sharma. Districts which reported new cases are Jodhpur (127), Kota (80), Jaipur (77), Udaipur(67), Dungarpur (55), Ajmer (54), Sirohi (49), Bhilwara (22), Rajsamand (22),Baran (18), Chittorgarh (14), Alwar (14), Pratapgarh (14), Nagaur (13), Sikar(12), Banswara (10), Jhalawar (9), Pali (8), Bundi (7), Sriganganagar (7),Jalore (7), Karauli (6), Bikaner (6), Sawai Madhopur (4), Bharatpur (3),Hanumangarh (3), Barmer (2), Dholpur (2), Dausa (1), Tonk (1) and Jaisalmer(1).

---||Chandigarh||Congress appointee Kishor can’t be a maverick this time: Sharma||Chandigarh: The Punjab Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Ashwani Sharma said on Thursday that Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh’s desperation in hiring Prashant Kishor as political adviser is an admission in itself that the party is nervous and desperate to face the state assembly elections scheduled early next year. He said Amarinder-led Congress government in Punjab has miserably failed on all fronts in the last four years and has thus hired a ‘maverick’ to bail it out of the mess it has created by non-governance. However, Sharma warned that Punjabi voters are astute in their political opinions and will not be misled by Kishor’s lies and deceit and in fact the voters want to ask Kishor why the promises and high profile manifesto of the Congress has not been implemented till date. The state BJP president said Kishor’s recent meeting with the first time MLAs is of no consequence, as no strategy of deceit and false promises will mislead the voters this time. “You cannot deceive people all the time and Amarinder will soon learn this truth in the hustings,” he said. BJP will never make false promises and will go to the people of Punjab with a clear plan of bringing the state back from economic depression to implement all round prosperity, added Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/congress-appointee-kishor-cant-be-a-maverick-this-time-sharma/articleshow/81695962.cms||---

The bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma has also directed the state government to file the action taken report in the Sampurna Behura case where the SC issued a slew of guidelines. According to the PIL, neither the Act nor the directions of the apex court have been implemented in the state. “We have asked for the court’s intervention for social audit rehabilitation as well as reforms and training of the police. These issues are necessary for the welfare of the juveniles in the country,” said Pragyan Sharma, counsel appearing for the petitioners. Satyarthi’s organisation has also filed similar petitions in several other states like Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. Earlier, based on the SC judgment, the Uttarakhand HC had initiated a suo motu PIL concerned with the implementation of guidelines as well as the Act, however, the court records show that nothing much has happened in the case. The court has now tagged the PIL along with Satyarthi’s petitioner and listed the case for further hearing on April 28.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/non-implementation-of-juvenile-justice-act-sc-guidelines-ukhand-hc-directs-state-to-respond-within-4-weeks/articleshow/81694380.cms||Prashant Jha

Spacewood had suffered major losses due a fire in December 2020. The company may also explore options for a fresh foreign investment to fund its expansion. Spacewood is working to bounce back from the fire losses. It also looking forward to get insurance claim of over Rs125 crore. Director of Spacewood Kirit Joshi told TOI that there are plans to pump in Rs50 crore in the coming financial year. The funds would also be used for expanding the brand’s presence in the country apart from consolidating its position in sector specific furniture. “We plan to fund investment through existing equity and also internal accruals. If the amount falls shorts, we may also look for foreign investment. Our existing investors may also be approached, we are open for debt from foreign partners too,” said Joshi. Japan’s Sumitomo Forestry had picked up 26% stake in Spacewood in 2015, making the first FDI in furniture sector. Joshi said in financial year 2020 the company clocked a turnover of Rs500 crore. There are plans to take it to Rs1,000 crore in the coming three years. In the next three years, investment to the tune of Rs100 crore would also be made, out of which pumping in Rs50 crore is slated for coming fiscal. However, Joshi admitted that the financial year ending March 2021 was not as good as the previous fiscal. The losses, both due to fire and lockdown, are expected to bring down the turnover to Rs300 crore. The prime focus is on achieving break even during the year. However, given the figures now, Rs500 crore turnover appears to be easily achievable, he said. With foray into specialized furniture, for sectors like healthcare and education, there are plans to expand retail presence to 30 cities as against 18 now. Spacewood has also tied up with US’ Cramer LLC and plans to introduce a range of hospice and modern laboratory furniture solutions for the Indian market.

According to the notification, the Kumbh Mela will be held from April 1 to 30. During this period, three "shahi snans" [royal bathing processions] will be held – on April 12, 14 and 27. It is to be noted that Kumbh Mela has been curtailed to a month for the first time in recent history in view of the recent surge in Covid-19 cases.

---||Delhi||NE Delhi mosque: Witness statements taken after last hearing, says city court||New Delhi: After police filed a report on the status of the complaint relating to the burning of a mosque during northeast Delhi violence on the direction of a Delhi court, the court noted that statements of witnesses were recorded in the matter after the last hearing when it had issued the direction. Additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav said, “The statements of witnesses have probably been recorded after March 17, 2021, i.e., the last date of hearing.” The court perused the case diaries relating the matter and said, “I have today signed all the case diaries. The case diaries have not been maintained in terms of Section 172 CrPC. The bound volume, as mandated by CrPC has not been maintained.” According to Section 172 CrPC, every police officer conducting an investigation should day by day enter his proceedings in the investigation in a diary. It had come on record that the complainant, Haji Hashim Ali, had sought registration of an FIR against those who had allegedly desecrated Madina mosque and a magistrate court had subsequently ordered police to lodge the FIR. The police challenged the magistrate’s order before the court of judge Yadav who on March 17 noted that FIR for desecration of the mosque was ordered on February 1, 2021 and police informed that there was already an FIR (55/2020) registered at Karawal Nagar police station. Judge Yadav had underscored that “no such averment was made by police” before the magistrate court. The court had noted that though Ali’s complaint dated June 25, 2020, bearing DD number 35A, was on record, wherein he has named 15 people as rioters, who allegedly burnt and desecrated the mosque, however, there was nothing on record with regard to the investigation in FIR 55/2020. It had, therefore, directed DCP (Northeast) to file a status report with regard to the investigation carried out in DD no. 35A. The court on the last occasion also found it “really strange” that the complaint with regard to burning of Ali’s house was clubbed with the complaint of one Naresh Chand, being FIR 72/2020, at Karawal Nagar police station. On Thursday, the state’s prosecutor said the investigation in relation to DD number 35A was in progress and appropriate steps were to be taken against the accused persons. The court, however, said, “Let the record of original DD number 35A be produced in court on the next date of hearing. It is prima facie evident that the DD no. 35A was not tagged either with case FIR no.55/20 or 72/20.” “I shall refrain from commenting upon the investigation at this stage, suffice it to say that a further status report in the matter be filed with regard to the investigation on DD number 35A and FIR number 55/20. SHO, PS Karawal Nagar and IO of the case shall remain present in court on the next date of hearing,” it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ne-delhi-mosque-witness-statements-taken-after-last-hearing-says-city-court/articleshow/81695972.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||Over 700 school students in Telangana test Covid positive in March||HYDERABAD: Over 700 Covid-19 cases have been reported from 226 schools across Telangana in March with a majority of cases from Kamareddy, Adilabad, and Mancherial districts. Almost all students, who had tested positive for Covid-19, were asymptomatic. Most cases were reported when officials conducted random tests or from schools where a student with fever or other symptoms attended physical classes. TimesViewThe growing cases of Covid among school students is worrying. Especially because a majority of them are asymptomatic. Given that Telangana has over 40,000 schools, of which tests have been conducted in only 226, authorities should immediately arrange for tracking and testing students in more schools to ensure these children do not become spreaders of the virus -- even outside the school premises.These 703 cases include students who tested positive by March 23. “In February, we had hardly seen any Covid-19 cases from schools,” an official from the department of school education said. The official said that although class 9 and class 10 students started attending classes from February 1, most schools had not reported any cases until March 10. “We started seeing Covid-19 cases only after upper primary school students started attending classes. While sporadic cases were reported from government schools, in residential schools tens of students have tested positive,” the official added. Teachers and officials at district-level said after upper primary school students started classes, they could not maintain social distance. “With physical classes for class 9 and class 10, we divided a class into multiple sessions and had less than 15 students in a class. When class 6 to class 8 students started coming, we kept students in a single class due to space constraints,” said M Ravinder, a teacher in a city government school. He said with hundreds of students using the same washrooms and drinking water taps, it was hard to stop the spread of Covid-19. They said asymptomatic students might have infected at least10-15% of teachers in one month. The number infected outside school might be much higher, teachers said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/over-700-school-students-int-test-covid-ve-in-march/articleshow/81695231.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

Though often confused with online classes by the existing school, ‘online schools’ have no brick-and-mortar buildings and exist only in virtual space. The study conducted by 21K School, an online school, deduced that 75% of the parents who responded are considering continuing this format of learning for an extended period even after schools return to normal operations. The survey mentioned that parents saw some ‘desirable factors’ in the online schools such as “learning flexibility, lower tuition fee, better retention, reach and transparency”. The note added that more than 30 crore students are being homeschooled all over the world. The report quoted third-party research which projects the Indian online education market to touch US$ 8.6 billion by 2026. “These statistics also substantiate results generated during the internally conducted research, which highlight that tier 2 cities in India are adopting online schooling at a higher rate” the report mentioned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/online-only-schools-gaining-momentum-survey/articleshow/81707854.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: HC extends relief to Dadra collector||MUMBAI: Bombay HC on Thursday extended interim protection granted to the collector of Dadra and Nagar Haveli who is an accused in the suicide of MP Mohan Delkar. A bench of Justices S S Shinde and Manish Pitale, hearing a plea by Sandeep Kumar Singh, to quash the FIR against him for abetment of Delkar’s suicide, adjourned the hearing after Delkar’s son Abhinav sought time to reply to the petition. Abhinav’s advocate Shyam Marwadi said, “There are false statements in the petition.” The judges posted the hearing on April 9 and orally directed that until then no coercive steps be taken against Singh. “He (Singh) will also cooperate,” said Justice Shinde. Senior advocate Amit Desai, for Singh, said he would. “There is no question of not... They are public servants.” To the court’s query, public prosecutor Deepak Thakare said the special investigation team had been set up. The judges asked Thakare to talk to the SIT head and convey the court’s oral direction. Singh has denied allegations of harassment against him as “baseless and false.” His petition informed that the only action taken by him concerning Delkar was pertaining to the SSR Trust chaired by him following a letter received by the PMO about complaints that the trust was encroaching upon certain government lands.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-extends-relief-to-dadra-collector/articleshow/81696807.cms||---

G Mallikarjuna, director, of SGNP, said the numbers have declined by 50% since February 15. With school holidays approaching, it was expected that the number of visitors would go up.

---||Jaipur||Land sharks encroach Kartarpura Nullah to construct illegal colony||JAIPUR: Rampant encroachment inside Katarpura Nullah, which links Dravyavati River, continues unabated as Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) has turned a blind eye towards the issue and not paying heed to the local residents’ complaints. The land mafia is filling the catchment areas by deploying scores of vehicles, which are relentlessly dumping debris and flattening the land to develop an illegal colony. A local resident said, “Influential land mafia is developing a colony near Sultanpura area. This would lead to blockage of catchment drainwater.” Explaining the modus operandi of the mafia, another colony resident said, “Earlier, the powerful mafias had encroached the JDA land falling under khasra 31,32,33 and 186 situated on the banks of the Nullah. Following this, now they are filling the nullah. Locals have complained to JDA several times, but nothing has been done till date.” Locals also alleged that even after Rajasthan High Court issued notices to senior administrative officials for the maintenance of Nullah, nothing has been done to prevent it. “The width of nullah near Sultanpur is less than 10 metres. The civic body should wake up from slumber before its nullah is encroached.” The nullah flows from Indira Bazaar to Amanishah Nullah near Gopalpura bypass and it passes through Panch Batti, C-Scheme, Sehkar Marg, Sudarshanpura and Kartarpura. Residents fear encroachment would obstruct the flow of drainage system. “As rampant encroachment inside the nullah is ongoing, possibilities of water flowing outside arise during rainy season. The flow of water in rain-fed nullah remains high during monsoon. Last year, a man was washed away in this inundated nullah.” A JDA official source agreed that the width of the nullah was not uniform. It varies from one place to another. Officials claimed that in one place it is 22 metres and 30 metres in another. It was seen that in densely populated areas, width of nullah is less in comparison to areas where population is less. Sources said waterlogging problem in the city has aggravated over the years as the civic body in the past failed to prevent encroachments. Without an adequate system, the water flows out of the city The Amanishah Nullah, Ganda Nullah, Jawahar Nullah, Kartarpura Nullah and Nag Talai are the bigger drains which finally meet at Dhund River. If these drains are encroached, it could lead to serious problem in future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/land-sharks-encroach-kartarpura-nullah-to-construct-illegal-colony/articleshow/81695240.cms||---

Schools, which had earlier tied up with third-party firms to provide online classes, discontinued services after physical classes started. The managements are yet to make a decision on whether or not to rehire them. “We are not going to start online classes at least for the next one week or 10 days,” said Shekar Rao Y, president, Telangana Recognized School Managements Association (TRSMA). “We might not start online classes at all for this academic year. This includes even class 10 students,” he added, and demanded that the state rethink its decision on the closure of schools and allow schools with no Covid-19 positive cases to continue with physical classes. Parents said school managements should immediately start online classes. “I got my daughter back home from hostel today afternoon.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Netas lend a helping hand to register for the jab||Mumbai: Some corporators from Andheri have set up or are planning help desks, mainly for slum-dwellers to get registered using Co-Win app, and to counsel them if they have apprehensions, to get more from slums areas to take the jab. Andheri MLA Ameet Satam said five BJP corporators in his assembly constituency set up desks at party offices. Where they do not have party corporators, Satam said he would set up help desks. He said BMC must take the drive to housing societies and complexes that have a minimum of 100 potential beneficiaries and health posts in slums to create more awareness. “Looking at rising cases, and the lukewarm response to vaccination, it is important to create more awareness. The response from slums is very poor,” Satam wrote to civic chief Iqbal Singh Chahal on March 24. Two days back, Juhu BJP corporator Renu Hansraj, who started a help desk for those from Nehru Nagar, said, “I have spoken to Cooper Hospital dean about the initiative. We are helping those from slums to register via the app, and sending them the date and time when they can get vaccinated. If needed, we are counseling them on why they must take the vaccine. Many fear they may get fever or have side effects after taking the vaccine, but we are telling them that they need not worry, as these conditions subside.”BMC has requested the Union government to allow home vaccination, said additional municipal commissioner (health) Suresh Kakani. “As per Government of India guidelines its not possible (for now),” he said. Some corporators have been demanding BMC provide home vaccinations for the disabled and bedridden senior citizens. In a letter to Chahal, Juhu corporator Aneesh Makwani said disabled and bed-ridden senior citizens are weak and susceptible to the virus. He said their condition prevents them from visiting vaccination centres.“BMC must start mobile vans and ambulances to take vaccination to their homes,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-netas-lend-a-helping-hand-to-register-for-the-jab/articleshow/81696003.cms||Richa Pinto

Now, the proposal will be sent to the state government for approval. The proposal of handing over the Aapli Bus was tabled to curb financial loss to the cash-starved NMC. The civic body incurs over Rs100 crore loss every year in running the city bus service as against ticket revenue of Rs64 crore per annum. TOI had reported that Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari was of the opinion that two public transport services — Metro Rail and city buses — should be run by one agency, which led NMC to table the proposal. At present, NMC runs a 438 bus fleet including 237 standard buses, 150 midi, 45 mini and six electric buses through three red bus and one electric bus operator. NMC will hand over these 438 buses along with 40 electric buses to be procured under Central government scheme to MahaMetro along with four bus operators, two ticketing agencies and the existing manpower of the transport department. The house also approved two more proposals of the civic administration to provide 18 mini buses and one electric bus to MahaMetro to run feeder services on several routes. Following objections raised by former mayor Sandip Joshi and ruling party leader Avinash Thakre, the mayor stalled the civic administration’s proposal to revise the lease rent of plots owned by NMC. The mayor formed a committee headed by former mayor Joshi and directed the administration to convene a hearing of 4,300 leased property holders and table a review proposal at the next general body meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/gbs-nod-to-hand-over-aapli-bus-to-mahametro/articleshow/81694402.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

In a press conference, Bharadwaj claimed that “the corporations are trying to harass shopkeepers by threatening them with sealing of shops in case they fail to deposit the conversion fees”. “All three municipal corporations of Delhi have collected crores of rupees in the name of conversion and parking charges from shopkeepers. This money can only be used for the development purpose of the specific markets,” said the AAP functionary. “We have got to know that in the name of conversion charges, they collected Rs 1,007 crore out of which they have used just Rs 30 crore for the development of the markets. Nobody has any account of the remaining money. We also got to know that now, only Rs 1.5 crore is remaining,” Bharadwaj claimed. The confrontation between AAP and BJP over municipal issues is growing as the municipal elections are coming closer. The civic polls are likely to be held early next year. “During the election, Delhi BJP put up posters thanking Prime Minister Narendra Modi for waiving off conversion charges. But now, the north and south corporations are serving notices to all the shopkeepers. The notice says that every shopkeeper will have to submit/deposit the conversion charges before March 31, 2021 and if they do not do that, their shops will be sealed or they will be penalised under the DMC Act,” said Bharadwaj.“This is why the BJP does not want the Delhi assembly committees to look after these matters and ask questions to the municipal corporations,” he added. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said that the three municipal corporations had never announced any waiver of conversion charges, except for some markets. “Announcing waiver is not in the hands of municipal corporations. Only DDA is authorised, so there is no question of the corporations announcing waiver of conversion charges,” said Kapoor. Kapoor said a waiver was announced for L&DO markets, which were originally allotted for commercial use, and the waiver formalities were under way. They have taken a little longer as shopkeepers have taken excess time to submit their cases for exemption. The process is now in the final stage, he added. “The civic bodies are issuing notices mostly to those against whom the annual conversion charges are due. Issuing conversion charge notice to assessees is no harassment,” said Kapoor, adding that if any L & DO property has got notice, they can wait for final settlement of their matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aap-and-bjp-clash-over-notices-for-conversion-charges/articleshow/81695995.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Hyderabad||Gandhi hospital may turn nodal centre for Covid patients again||Hyderabad: With the numbers of cases of coronavirus increasing in the city and districts, the state-run Gandhi Hospital, may once again become the nodal Covid-19 treatment centre. While stating that a close watch is being kept on admissions of critical Covid-19 cases, post-graduate doctors however said that the government should consider decentralisation of patients to other state-run hospitals. “The cases are increasing, but we still do not have a clarity on whether Gandhi will once again be converted into a Covid-19 hospital. In case the situation arises, we think the government should consider decentralisation of patients to other state-run centres to avoid burden on resident doctors here,” said Dr P Leela Madhav, a postgraduate doctor at Gandhi hospital. “We are ready to treat Covid-19 patients but on rotation basis. We cannot afford to lose one more year of our academics only to treating Covid-19 patients and miss out on other specialities,” said Dr Madhav. Members of Junior Doctors Association (JUDA), meanwhile, submitted a representation to the superintendent of the hospital against the conversion of Gandhi back to Covid-19 hospital. “Looking at only Gandhi Hospital as a Covid speciality hospital and ignoring others shows lack of preparedness even after one year of the pandemic. We can’t afford to lose even a single day of our residency,” the representation read. As per the data released by the state health department, there are 1,890 beds in Gandhi Hospital out of which 1,500 are ICU and oxygen supported. As on Thursday, a total of 10 regular beds, 14 oxygen beds and 64 ICU supported beds were occupied, while the remaining 1,802 beds were vacant. Meanwhile, the superintendent of Gandhi Hospital, M Raja Rao said, “We have no orders from the government or higher authorities from the health department till now to convert Gandhi Hospital into a Covid speciality hospital. This time the situation is also very different since several other hospitals are also treating Covid-19 patients. Initially, when the pandemic started, no other hospital admitted Covid-19 patients for about six months.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/gandhi-hospital-may-turn-nodal-centre-for-covid-patients-again/articleshow/81695261.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

In reply, Rajamani had assured the activists that the sealing of brick kilns would continue.Based on a high court order on February 10, the district administration had earlier issued closure notices to 171 illegal brick kilns. Subsequently, 22 brick kilns along the forest fringes were sealed on March 19. A senior director with the mines and geology department said they had also sealed another 30 illegal brick kilns at Anaikatti, Nanjundapuram, Somaiyampalayam and Pannimadai over the past three days.On Thursday, a total of 134 illegal brick kilns at Thadagam and Veerapandi were sealed. The official said while closure notices were issued to only 171 brick kilns, they had sealed 186 illegal brick kilns so far.Pointing out that there were 197 brick kilns violating rules and laws, activists, meanwhile, said 11 brick kilns were yet to face action.“We will inspect the remaining brick kilns and find out if they need to be closed. We will also investigate why they have not been issued closure notices,” the official said.Activists and residents, who were worried that the transfer of the district collector would cause delay in action against the brick kilns, were relieved to see the sealing process in full steam on the day.S Ganesh, an activist, said, “If there is a delay in the sealing process, the brick kilns may bribe and get a stay order. In fact, a couple of units were seen manufacturing bricks while the sealing process was in progress.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/134-illegal-brick-kilns-sealed-at-thadagam-veerapandi/articleshow/81695266.cms||---

As part of increased surveillance programme, officials are now trying to identify super spreaders immediately and isolate them as early possible. Increased number of cases in clusters and the presence of superspreaders has made officials ramp up testing. Within one week, the state is expected to go for one lakh tests a day, which it has the capacity for. “Superspreaders are mostly found in large conglomerations like markets and bus stands. We are going to these spots and doing random tests, irrespective of whether symptoms are seen or not,” an official said. On a positive note, official say in the last few days there has been an increase in the number of people turning up for vaccination. Earlier, health department officials were able to administer 25,000 to 30,000 doses, but there has been a jump to 40,000 doses daily recently. “This is due to the fear of a possible second wave in the state. People are now slowly understanding the importance of the vaccine. We have requested more vaccine doses from the Centre,” a health official said. Speaking about the need to take a vaccine, Dr Kiran Madala, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) certified-researcher said, “With more asymptomatic cases, it is all the more important to take the jab. People without co-morbidities also should not delay taking the vaccine as they can become silent carriers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/65-city-superspreaders-on-health-dept-radar/articleshow/81695268.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

---||Kolkata||From security to tourism, election focus shifts in erstwhile Red zone||JHARGRAM: Jangalmahal’s Jhargram was once a Maoists hotbed. Today, its forests of sal, segun and mohua are dotted with homestays not only providing a slice of rural and forest life to urbanites, but also creating livelihoods for local people and reviving the economy of the jungles which suffered a setback due to a decade long unrest in the region. Homestays have become popular in this region as hotels are located at a distance from the forests which are the main attraction of this region. The locals feel the government’s efforts to keep the region peaceful has turned Jhargram into a tourist destination which is fuelling the demand for homestays. Several communities residing in the forests have converted two or three rooms into homestays which has started attracting tourists from the cities and towns. The facilities are rudimentary with a mattress to sleep on and a chair and a dimly lit bulb. The net connectivity is absent and calls hardly get through, but most tourists seek this experience to detach from the chaos of urban living and detox in the lap of nature. Moni Mahato has converted two mud huts inside the jungles of Aguibil, around 7 kilomtres from Belpahari, into homestays. She neither has funds to promote it on social media nor does she advertise it to attract travellers. “But on most days of the month both the huts are occupied by guests. The business has picked up particularly in the last six months when people want to avoid crowded places for the fear of Covid. Inside this forest you might not spot a single person for hours, so the fear of virus is almost zero,” said Moni. Many homestay owners are also organising small trails for the tourists inside the jungle and even demonstrate how they use forest resources in their daily lives. “We take our guests inside the jungle to pick sal leaves,” said Jahrna Pahariya, who has set up three huts with thatched roofs on a piece of land her family owns in Mohanpur village on Jhargram-Jharkhand border. The stay is affordable costing anything between Rs 500 and Rs 750 for a day and the food is made from fresh farm produce from the owners’ backyard. “We pick whatever vegetables we grow in our backyard and cook poultry reared by us. The entire cooking is done in front of the guests,” said Bireswar Hansda, who has turned a part of his house into a homestay. People in the region want the government to promote tourism in Jhargram and provide loans and incentives to convert huts into homestays. It has already started creating livelihoods for people in the area. “More than 200 totos operate only in Belpahari to ferry people to and from railway stations. Several local women have opened small stores selling products made of forest produce. The local markets are also thriving,” said a panchayat member at Binpur block.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/from-security-to-tourism-election-focus-shifts-in-erstwhile-red-zone/articleshow/81695265.cms||Zeeshan Javed

With more new cases and fewer recoveries, the number of hospitalized patients is increasing daily in Nagpur. Apart from native patients, the city receives serious patients from across Vidarbha and adjacent states. As a result, patients are facing a bed shortage like never before. The administration is trying new measures to deal with this situation. On Thursday, mayor Dayashankar Tiwari directed the civic administration to start 24x7 vaccination centres in all six legislative constituencies coming in city limits. Tiwari directed increase in number of oxygen cylinders in the corporation hospital and to make adequate arrangements for medicines. He suggested Covid-19 treatment in AYUSH Hospital at Sadar and also to start a walk-in center at Pachpaoli. NMC will soon seek the help of NGOs to find people violating home isolation rules, he said. As vaccination is going to be the only efficient measure to control Covid-19, civic body is now trying to start vaccination in more private hospitals and encourage people to get themselves jabbed. Divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar also held a review meeting on Thursday. He directed NMC to collect information about the available beds in all hospitals of the city in one single system and start live dashboard. Oxygen tankers are being made available daily from Bhilai Steel Plant for Nagpur. Soon, a proposal will be sent to the concerned company to increase this supply from one tanker to three tankers. Soon, there will be September-like restrictions on the use of oxygen, under which 80% of total produced oxygen will be used exclusively for healthcare and 20% for industry, said Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/record-47-deaths-in-a-day-in-nagpur-district/articleshow/81707884.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

---||Kolkata||At Tajpur, deep sea port a key poll issue||Tajpur: Subhash Khoyal, 72, built a eatery on Jalda-Tajpur Road near Digha two years ago spending Rs 25 lakh. In December last year, a businessman from Contai offered him a price of Rs 50 lakh for the place which meant 100% profit. But Khoyal, after discussing the matter with his three sons, declined the offer. “Do you think I am crazy?” he laughs while serving a breakfast of tea, bread and omelette to a group of tourists on a sunny morning. “I have already purchased 5 cottahs of land across the road where I will make a hotel. We are scouting for more land,” said Khoyal. Bengal government’s plan to construct a deep sea greenfield port in Tajpur near Digha for which it has already floated the expression of interest has already triggered a scramble to purchase land in the area. The TMC is aware about the political benefit the port will bring beyond the heightened economic activity. “Akhil Giri and his men have taken down names of around 1,500 young boys and girls in the area and promised that as soon as work on the construction of port will start we will be getting the jobs,” said Lakhsman Khoyal, Subhas’s son. At present, the Kolkata Port Trust (KoPT) has two ports — Kolkata Dock System (KDS) and Haldia Dock Complex (HDC) — and they are the major seaports in Bengal and have been a key driver of industrial growth in the region by facilitating imports, exports and coastal movement of raw materials and finished goods. Last year, the state government announced its plan to construct a deep see port at Tajpur because of the good road connectivity and proximity to mineral rich belts in Bengal, Jharkhand, Odisha and Chhattisgarh. “The day the plan to construct the port was announced the price of land in the region more than trebled. Villagers who mostly work as daily wage labourers are now getting good offers from businessmen who want to set up hotels and other facilities,” said Somnath Panda, a local TMC leader. Close to 100 kilometres from where the port is to come up is the Petuaghat fishing harbour which completely changed the fortunes of this part of East Midnapore. The harbour which is said to be the biggest in Asia sparked development in the area by employing several thousand local youths. “If the port comes up it will change the fortunes here. TMC leaders have promised they will build the port if they return to office,” said Lakhsman.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/at-tajpur-deep-sea-port-a-key-poll-issue/articleshow/81695303.cms||Zeeshan Javed

In the Rs 130 crore scam, the CBI said in its FIR that around 70 to 90 lakh metric tonnes of minestone had been allegedly mined over the years. The accused having white ration cards have been identified as Nelluri Sreenivasa Rao, Vemula Narasimha Rao, Orsu Venkateswarlu, Vemula Edukondalur, Irla Venkat Rao, B Narasimha Rao and V Ratnam. TGV Krishna Reddy, who filed a PIL in the AP high court, alleged that most of the 17 persons named initially in the CID FIR and later by the CBI hailed from BPL families.  “I have mentioned in my PIL about the details of the white ration card holders. Some of them are small-time miners. Some are benamis for local politicians. The rich are doing illegal mining,” he alleged. He said till 2017 alone, 98 lakh MTs of limestone worth Rs 500 crore could have been plundered by the mining lobby. The CBI said between 2014 and 2018, the accused took over private patta lands, leased quarries and revenue lands in Piduguralla and Dachepalli areas in Guntur and mined them for limestone. The CBI conducted searches on Telugu Desam Party former MLA of Gurazala Yarapathineni Srinivasa Rao in November 2020 and on his followers in connection with the case. It said a volumetric analysis of sattelite imagery was done to find out how lakhs of tonnes of limestone worth several crores of rupees had been plundered. As per an affidavit filed by the mines and geology secretary in August 2018 in the high court, it was said: “A total of 31 lakh tonnes of illegal limestone and mosaic chips had been mined and an mount of Rs 130 crore, including seiniorage fee, sale value and penalty have to be paid by the accused who did illegal mining.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/mining-scam-accused-are-white-ration-card-holders/articleshow/81695302.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||Allahabad||Designer furniture made in Naini central jail adorn UP courts||Prayagraj: Prayagraj: The Allahabad high court and district courts of Kanpur Dehat and Mahoba rely on Naini Central Jail inmates to meet their designer furniture requirements. Be it wooden racks, judges chairs, tables, stools, almirah, sofa-set, centre table or other office types of furniture, a team of 70 inmates work relentlessly to meet out the demand for furniture. The designer furniture is being prepared as per the designs provided by the courts. P N Pandey, senior jail superintendent of Naini central jail told TOI, “the Sheesham wood furniture prepared by inmates is in demand in the state courts. He added, "jail authorities have received orders worth Rs 1 crore in January this year from different courts of the state and around 70 per cent furniture made by inmates have already been dispatched. He also said that courts were the major buyers of quality furniture prepared by jail inmates. But other government departments have also shown interest in the same. “A team of 70 inmates work around six to eight hours daily to shape designer furniture," said Pandey. "The jail supplies over 200 furniture, particularly for office purposes, on-demand every year," he added. He further claimed that furniture is being supplied on-demand only. We receive demand from the various district courts of the state and admitted that Allahabad High Court is one of the major clients of products made by inmates. A product has to meet certain criteria and clear a quality test before it is supplied to the buyer. There are many inmates lodged at Naini central jail who had earlier worked as carpenters and take interest in shaping the new design of furniture. Similarly, other inmates are also being trained in furniture manufacturing by the trained ones. The jail authorities also appreciate the efforts of inmates for shaping designer furniture and even provides a certificate of appreciation after an inmate acquires the skills. Pandey, meanwhile, said “The inmates also acquire skills that can be used after being released from jail and secondly, they can also go for setting up their business while learning the skill. A balance sheet is also maintained where the task done by every inmate and his earning is registered,” said Pandey. Jail authorities also organise events to teach inmates about employment skills to help them join mainstream after release from prison,” officials claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/designer-furniture-made-in-naini-central-jail-adorn-up-courts/articleshow/81694406.cms||---

Without naming any political party, the video, which is a montage of shots of the participants in different parts of the city, takes a stand against fake news, against the attempt at passing off mythology as history, against the bid to destroy the democratic fabric of the nation. A joint effort by Anupam Roy, Parambrata Chattopadhyay, Anirban Bhattacharya, Piya Chakraborty, Kaushik Sen, Santilal Mukherjee, Surangana Bandyopadhyay, Riddhi Sen and Rwitobroto Mukherjee, the video features actors and directors—veterans and current, of stage and film—including, Arun Mukhopadhya, Rudraprasad Sengupta, Sabyasachi Chakrabarty, Suman Mukhopadhyay, Chandan Sen, Anindya Chatterjee, Rahul Banerjee, Debleena Dutt Mukherjee and Reshmi Sen. Modhura Palit and the team during the shooting of the videoModhura Palit and the team during the shooting of the videoThe inspiration was the original song, composed by Anirban and Subhadeep Guha. Brevity of Anirban’s hard-hitting lyrics has turned it into an “emotional message”, rather than a “political propaganda”. “I wrote the lyrics during the anti-NRC-CAA movement. In the current toxic environment, an artist is unfortunately expected to either use the mainstream rhetoric or remain silent,” said Anirban, who questioned this divide in the song. It was recorded privately last year with Anupam, Anirban, Subhadeep, Riddhi, Surangana, Rwitobroto lending their voice, along with Arko Mukhaerjee, Rupankar Bagchi, Anindya, Debraj Bhattacharya, Sampa Biswas and Ujan Chatterjee. Riddhi, along with Surangana, wrote the screenplay. In January 2021, he and Rwitobroto began directing the video. But Anirban was clear about letting them work independently on the video. “The video reflects their honest reaction to the song and society at large,” said Anirban.‘Nijeder Mote Nijeder Gaan’, a song created by like-minded celebrities who are against fascism, has taken the internet by stormThough many said the video featured Left-leaning celebs, Riddhi insisted not everyone was on the same page politically. “Some may vote for Trinamool, some Left. But they are all against fascist forces. A labour of love, the video was filmed by Modhura Palit and edited by Subhajit Singha,” he said. The first striking image is that of Riddhi reading a book on Khajuraho while singing ‘tumi puran ke bolo itihas aar itihas ke bolo purano’ (for you, mythology is history and history is backdated). The video hits out at those who threaten to banish anyone from India if there’s any note of dissent. Rwitobroto said, “The term, ‘intellectual’, has become a slang under fascists. They can ask anyone and everyone to go to Pakistan. I will go there on my own terms, not on their orders.” A screenshot from this music videoAnother interesting point is the use of 20-odd newspaper clippings. Dhee Majumder and Rajarshi Nag, who did the graphics, had to strike a balance between creativity and facts. Social worker Piya, who was involved in the content research, said, “We used headlines that were close to the core issue. Who gave the far-right forces of India the authority to claim they were the only patriots and that everyone with a different opinion was anti-national? Their brand of patriotism questionable and farcical on many counts. ”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/celebs-take-musical-stand-against-divisive-politics/articleshow/81695329.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

Currently, around 14 % of the population, including citizens above 60 years of age and 45-year-old (and above) individuals with comorbidities are entitled for the vaccines. The likely hike in beneficiaries is expected to be 11%. Once this happens. around 25% (30 lakh) of the Pune Metropolitan Region’s (PMR) total population (117 crore) will be the vaccine beneficiaries. Officials stated that the civic and district administrations were getting ready to increase the vaccination sites. An official said the PMR might soon have 100 vaccination sites. “We are doing the projections on the basis of the likely increase in the vaccination demand,” assistant director (medical), Pune circle, Sanjay Deskhmukh said, adding that the exact number of the hike in the vaccination centres would be available within a couple of days. “The administration is taking steps to meet the additional demand for vaccines. Efforts are on to ensure optimum utilization of the existing vaccination sites. The civic body has started 24x7 vaccination sites as well,” said Vaishali Jadhav, a senior official in the Pune Municipal Corporation’s health department.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: IIT-B profs create robot for reconnaissance, search ops||Mumbai: A team of researchers from IIT-Bombay has developed a tele-operated spherical robot that can be used for reconnaissance and search, and can be controlled from a safe distance. The outer body of the robot is ball shaped and houses the sensor and electronics inside. It can also help in indoor mapping and detection of sound and fire sources. The low-cost product has already been showcased before several internal security agencies. Leena Vachhani, principal investigator from the system and control engineering department, and Abhishek Gupta from the mechanical engineering department developed the robot with help from the project staff under the aegis of National Center of Excellence in Technology for Internal Security (NCETIS). “The tele-operated robot may be deployed in hazardous, difficult and enemy intruded areas and controlled from a safe region. The structure of the spherical robot has many advantages over conventional mobile vehicles or humanoids. The ball shape enables it to roll in any direction or planar surfaces,” said Vachhani. It is robust to collisions and can manoeuvre in any direction and even traverse through narrow passages for surveillance, she added. It can be even be used to patrol areas where human intrusion is dangerous. The camera mounted on the robot provides visual feedback to the operator, which helps in better control. NCETIS is aimed at developing indigenous technology solutions for internal security forces. It is a joint initiative of the ministry and IIT-Bombay under the Digital India flagship programme. The institute received funds from the ministry of eldctronics and IT for 20 projects, including the robot. Its variants can provide wireless communication modules, payload carrying capability and easy deployment options. Vachhani said product trials have taken place with the National Security Guard. A patent has been filed recently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-iit-b-profs-create-robot-for-reconnaissance-search-ops/articleshow/81694432.cms||Yogita Rao

Dr NK Arora, a member of the nation Covid-19 task force and an advisor to the Adverse Event Following Immunization (AEFI) Committee, said data on the deaths will soon be shared on a public portal. His comments come days after 29 experts in the country demanded the government make the information on the deaths public. “The AEFI work-up is an ongoing process. We will soon share the findings in a transparent manner with all concerned. But what I can clearly state now is that so far, none of the deaths is related to any of the two vaccines," Dr Arora told TOI on Thursday. He added that people should not hesitate to get themselves vaccinated. Health officials added that adequate measures are in place to treat any adverse event following vaccination, including availability of anaphylaxis kits at each vaccination site and immediate referrals to AEFI management centres. People experiencing adverse events are also offered free treatment at public health facilities. But experts have said the government should ensure AEFI data is available in the public domain. The 29 experts who wrote to the Centre recently said open-sharing of the data will usher in transparency and improve scientific investigation. “We understand that at least 65 deaths have occurred following vaccination for Covid-19 since the vaccination campaign started on January 16. However, the National AEFI Committee’s investigation findings of only two of these deaths have been made public,” the experts wrote in their letter addressed to top government officials, including Dr Arora. The experts also said reports of other serious AEFIs, including neurological symptoms, hemiplegia and Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS), also need to be investigated. Their letter demanded that details of serious AEFIs, status of investigations and autopsy findings should be made public by the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/no-link-between-vaccines-and-79-reported-deaths-top-expert/articleshow/81695327.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Taking suo motu cognisance of the TOI article, the panel asked the DGP to file a report in this regard within six weeks. A copy of the proceedings has also been sent to the member secretary of Uttar Pradesh State Legal Services Authority to ensure free legal aid to the arrested individuals, if not provided yet. Issuing the notice, the Commission has observed that the contents of the media report raise serious human rights violations. "The incident, apparently, is a classic example of failure of the entire system of checks and balances. Hence, fair investigation is required to be conducted to know from where the policemen could manage to procure these items," the notice stated. The eatery owner, Praveen Kumar Yadav, who is specially-abled, had alleged that on March 4, two constables had refused to pay Rs 400 bill after eating food. “They were offering only Rs 80. My elder brother requested them to pay at least Rs 200. Some of the customers also asked them to pay the bill. Following an argument, the policemen started beating my brother. They were drunk and threatened to send us to jail.” Yadav added that after the argument, constables left the eatery on Agra Road. “Soon, 15 policemen arrived and took my brother and cousin along with eight customers to Kotwali Dehat police station and registered an FIR against them.” In the FIR, they alleged that the 10 people were part of an organised gang and were hatching a plan for loot. Police also claimed that they were held following an encounter. In the recovery, local police showed six illegal weapons, 80-litre illicit liquor and 2kg contraband. And that the "gang" had fired six rounds. Additional director general of police (Agra Zone) Rajeev Krishna had taken strict cognizance of the matter. On the basis of the primary investigation conducted by the Etah district’s additional superintendent of police (Crime) Rahul Kumar, the ADG ordered the suspension of constable Santosh Kumar and Shailendra Kumar. An FIR was also registered against the two constables and Kotwali Dehat station house officer Indreshapal Singh. The three cops were absconding. UP police have launched an operation to arrest them. Police are also searching for liquor mafia Bantu Yadav who allegedly helped the cops for staging a fake recovery from the 10 men.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/dhaba-encounter-nhrc-notice-to-up-dgp-over-arrest-of-10-people-after-bill-dispute/articleshow/81694434.cms||Deepak Lavania

NMC has filed a complaint with Nagpur police cyber cell and also suspended two employees of tax departments from Gandhibagh and Hanuman Nagar zones – Sanjay Khadgi and Gaurishankar Rahate, deputy municipal commissioner Milind Meshram informed the NMC general body on Thursday. Datke exposed how Khadgi’s login and password was used to reduce Rs2.30 lakh property tax of a commercial establishment under Dhantoli zone to Rs70,000. However, Khadgi was posted in Gandhibagh zone. Khadgi had allegedly reduced the assessed tax even though the property owner had approached the high court against NMC. Similarly, Rahate too was involved in a similar scam, said Datke. Similar misappropriation was also unearthed in Dharampeth and Laxmi Nagar zones through user IDs and passwords of employees of other zones. “After the property tax department learnt about the misuse of user IDs and passwords for lowering assessed taxes, the NMC’s property tax department approached the Nagpur city police cyber cell and filed a complaint in this regard,” Meshram informed the House. Besides this, the department has also suspended Rahate and Khadgi in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-seeks-cyber-cell-help-in-tax-reduction-scam/articleshow/81694441.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

Doon-based social activist Anoop Nautiyal, expressing concern, said on Thursday that the high court has pointed out that the condition of the 550-bed hospital created for Kumbh is not upto the mark. “There is lack of medical staff as 40 doctors are yet to join. The oxygen cylinders have not been fitted with the beds and ventilators have not been installed,” he said, citing key highlights of the HC order issued on Wednesday. The district administration of Haridwar, however, claimed that it has readied 10,000 beds in hotels and ashrams to meet the needs of pilgrims in case of a health emergency during the Kumbh. District magistrate of Haridwar C Ravishankar said, “Around 10,000 beds have been reserved, including in hotels and ashrams, for Covid care in Haridwar. A total of 38 ventilators are now available and staff for the ICUs will soon arrive from the Kumbh Mela health department. There are two dedicated hospitals for Covid care in Haridwar where ventilator facilities have been provided.”A prefabricated 150-bed hospital, including burn units and ICU facilities, has also been installed in Haridwar for the Kumbh Mela, he added. The administration has plans to deploy at least 400 doctors on Kumbh duty, he further said. Meanwhile, keeping in view the rapid increase in the number of Covid cases across the country, there are rising demands that the annual Jhanda Mela – which is organised in Dehradun and attracts a large number of devotees, specially from Punjab and Haryana -- be conducted ‘strictly on the lines of the Kumbh and with specified SOPs’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/health-facilities-at-kumbh-yet-to-meet-set-standards-activists/articleshow/81694445.cms||Shivani Azad

While the Madras high court has court has directed the state to resolve the hurdles in land acquisition in two months, a source from the state highways department said that the deadline is unlikely to be met since the defence ministry is hesitating to accept the compensatory land identified in Mannarpuram.The source said that officials from the defence ministry and senior state bureaucrats had met in New Delhi on March 3 and 23. During the interactions, the ministry was explained about the compensatory land identified at the police battalion campus in Mannarpuram, a few metres away from the required defence land. Sources said that the ministry is keen on acquiring compensatory land in Hanumanthapuram in Chengalpet district. Other projects such as airport expansion in Trichy and Coimbatore that require defence land are likely to be clubbed with the RoB project for availing the compensatory land in bulk. “Madras high court has directed us to complete the land acquisition within May, but if all the infrastructure projects awaiting defence land were merged, it will be difficult to identify compensatory land,” a source said. Apart from completing the pending RoB, the defence land is crucial for initiating phase II of the RoB.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/meetings-fail-to-break-defence-land-deadlock/articleshow/81696072.cms||Deepak Karthik

Bank manager Prahlad Pingava lodged a complaint with Manthani police of Peddapalli district in Ramagundam commissionerate alleging that burglars gained entry into SBI’s Gunjapadugu branch by breaking the rear side window grill and the cement cover. After gaining entry into the bank, the accused cut the power supply to the alarm and also removed its batteries to completely disable it. They also removed the digital video recorder connected to CCTV cameras. “The gang cut the strong room locks. Using gas welding kit, they opened the chest containing gold and cash. They escaped with six kilo gold and Rs 18 lakh cash,” Ramagundam commissioner V Satyanarayana said. Clues Team visited the spot and lifted some fingerprints from the spot. After committing the offence, the accused abandoned the gas cylinder at the spot. Police suspect that at least four offenders might have been involved in the offence and they might have conducted a recce before committing the offence. “The offenders knew from where they can gain entry into the bank and they also have clear knowledge of the location of alarm, DVR and how to disable them.

---||Nagpur||Hotter days reduce output by factory workers, increase absenteeism||NAGPUR: Amongst many other damaging effects of climate change, the latest to be come to fore are reduced worker productivity and increased absenteeism on hot days. Research by Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC), Indian Statistical Institute, New Delhi, and Delhi School Of Economics reveals that manufacturing in India might be hampered due to heat stress on workers. The analysis, which highlights how climate control significantly mitigates productivity losses, states that it gets harder for people to work when it gets hot, and this may lead to a reduction in national output in warmer years. “The aggregate effects are large enough to significantly reduce the output of the manufacturing sector,” it adds. The researchers used several high-frequency micro-data sets of workers’ output and analysed a nationally representative dataset of more than 58,000 factories across the country. These factories had more labour intensive output (a mix of metal works, diamonds, garments etc). The researchers found that plants produce about 2% less revenue for every one-degree rise in annual temperature. “This is also reflected in lower Indian Gross Domestic Product (GDP) output in hot years, and possibly lower year-on-year growth. The greatest declines occurred in labour-intensive plants,” they said. Pointing out that the effect of high temperatures on lower crop yields has been previously established, Anant Sudarshan, South Asia Director of EPIC, said, “This study shows that rising temperatures can also hurt economic output in other sectors by reducing productivity of human labour. The damage is greatest when already warm days become hotter. If India wishes to succeed in becoming a manufacturing powerhouse using cheap labour, we need to think hard about how we can adapt to a hotter world.” Sudarshan co-authored this study with E Somanathan of Indian Statistical Institute, Delhi, Rohini Somanathan of Delhi School of Economics, and Meenu Tewari of University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The authors argue that although the focus of the paper is on Indian manufacturing plants, heat stress is a universal physiological mechanism, and there are implications for any sector where labour is important. The study has been done over a period of few years. “We see that in the absence of climate control, worker productivity declines on hot days and we spot absenteeism even for workers in factories with cooling facilities. When you compound that with limited adoption of climate control technologies in manufacturing industries, you know that we are dealing with a complex problem here,” E Somanathan explains. So what does the future look like? “It is entirely possible that the industrial sector might respond to high temperatures by increasing automation and shifting away from labour-intensive sectors in hot parts of the world. These adaptive responses may negatively influence wage inequality,” adds Somanathan. Raising a similar concern, Sudarshan adds, “The trends that we see in our data makes us think that warm countries in the developing world may face a pervasive ‘heat tax’ that could damage the competitiveness of their manufacturing sectors and further hurt the wages of poor workers. Research into low-cost technologies to protect workers from ambient temperatures may have significant social value.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hotter-days-reduce-output-by-factory-workers-increase-absenteeism/articleshow/81694459.cms||Manka Behl

Representatives of several private hospitals had said the centre did not have basic facilities such as drinking water and washroom and the supply of vaccines was limited though the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) claimed to have ample stock. “It takes hours for the staffers to distribute the vaccines to the hospital representatives. Availability of stock is minimal,” said Jitendra Oswal, deputy director of Bharati Hospital. Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Hospital Board of India’s Pune chapter, told TOI, “Inadequate availability of doses is an issue. A few days ago, one of the private hospital representative after hours of waiting got only five vials (50 doese) of Covishield. When the beneficiaries walk in for inoculation, it becomes tough for the private hospital staffers to make them understand that it is not a hospital’s fault to have fewer doses.” PMC additional commissioner Rubal Agarwal said, “The civic body has ample stock and so far distributed 1.44 lakh doses among private hospitals. Of these, 1.04 lakh have been used. The other point is that almost 40,000 doses are pending with private hospitals. These doses are either being misused or their entry has not been created by the hospitals in the online system, which is mandatory. Either way, the private hospitals should act responsibly.” On the delay in the distribution, Agarwal said the administration has told the centre at Narayan Peth to remain open from 9am to 9pm “without fail”. The official added that the civic body would soon ensure facilities such as drinking water and washroom at the distribution centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-to-streamline-vax-distribution-centres-functioning/articleshow/81695337.cms||Piyush Bhusari

The villagers said that the damaged check dam has caused the tragedy.The victims were identified as Sruthi, 9, Sudarvizhi, 7, and Rohith, 6. The three cousins are from Manapathur village near Sendurai. On Wednesday, the children were playing near Chinna Odai stream passing through the village. Only about six months ago, a check dam was built across the stream under the MGNREGA scheme spending Rs 15 lakh. However, during the monsoon, a portion of the check dam crashed. While playing on the damaged part of the check dam, the youngest of the three, Rohith, was said to have accidentally fallen into the water. In order to save him, the other two children, Sudarvizhi and Sruthi, jumped into the water, but all of them drowned. The incident came to light only after the families, who were searching for the children, found the bodies in the check dam. As rainwater was flowing through the broken part of the dam, a portion of the stream became deep, and the children drowned in the deep portion. Meanwhile, Ariyalur district secretary of the DMK, S S Sivasankar said that the tragedy occurred due to the substandard construction of the check dam. “Authorities are trying to play down the deaths. The dam did not even stand for six months, we need a proper investigation,” he said. Official sources said they were planning to refurbish the check dam in the coming months.tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/three-kids-drown-in-check-dam-in-ariyalur/articleshow/81696091.cms||---
---||Delhi||Ensure status quo on Yamuna water supply for 24 hours: SC||New Delhi: Following a panic plea by Delhi government about the impending 25% reduction in water supply to the national capital, the Supreme Court on Thursday ordered Punjab government and Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMB) to continue full supply of water as done earlier for the next 24 hours. Taking up an urgent application by Delhi Jal Board, a bench led by Chief Justice S A Bobde said water supply was a fundamental right and ordered status quo till March 26. DJB said Punjab government and BBMB were scheduling repair of the sluice gates of Bhakra main canal that carries water to Delhi and it is expected that supply will be hit by 25%. This could lead to a clash between Delhi and Punjab, the latter being very sensitive to sharing its share of water with neighbouring states. Its water dispute with Haryana and Rajasthan over construction of Sutlej-Yamuna Link canal has been a much litigated issue and the Amarinder Singh government, in its earlier tenure, had resorted to the extreme step of scrapping water agreements with Rajasthan and Haryana. The DJB employed a battery of lawyers — senior advocates A M Singhvi, Vikas Singh and lawyer Gautam Narayan — to argue that the repair work could easily be carried out in the autumn or winter season, when Delhi’s requirement of water is considerably less than the summer months. The bench told the counsel that if repair work was required to maintain the integrity of the water channel, then it would be difficult to stop the work. However, Narayan said that DJB officials had visited the site and found that the repair work was not urgently required and could be deferred. Singhvi termed the repair work routine and said any reduction in water supply would severely affect the national capital. Appearing for Haryana, senior advocate Shyam Divan said the DJB was making a series of false statements before the SC and claimed that Haryana had been providing the mandated full supply of water to Delhi. “Water supply to Delhi from Haryana has not been reduced by even a drop,” he said. DJB said, “Several requests have been made to Punjab government and its officials to desist from their proposed course of action over the past few weeks and defer the proposed action till after the summer season or provide an alternative source of supply of raw water to Delhi to cater to its drinking water needs. These have fallen on deaf ears.” “Present writ petition is being filed on an emergent basis owing to the fact that nearly 40% of supply from the Yamuna river is proposed to be cut off, resulting in reduction of about 215 MGD of drinking water. As a result, Delhi will be starved of at least 25% of its drinking water supply.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ensure-status-quo-on-yamuna-water-supply-for-24-hours-sc/articleshow/81696119.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Police said the accused and the victim were in a relationship for several years. “The woman, Sonam Pandey, was angry with Devendra Kumar since his marriage had been fixed with some other girl,” a police officer said. Devendra was to wed on April 28. Talking to TOI, Devendra's brother-in-law Badan Singh said, "He was the only son among six siblings. His parents were not aware of his relationship with this woman.” Sonam and Kumar used to work together at a private hospital till a few years ago. She was a nurse there, while Kumar worked as a lab assistant. “Later they moved to different hospitals, but their relationship remained unaffected,” said Amit Prasad, sub-inspector (SI) at Hariparvat police station. Sonam, a resident of Auraiya district, lived alone in Agra’s Khandari area, the SI said. Her husband and an eight-year-old daughter lived separately. Devendra was from Kasganj district. Both of them got jobs in Agra and were living on rent. On Thursday morning, Sonam called Devendra to repair a fan in her house. But she actually wanted to talk about his wedding. After a heated argument, she allegedly threw acid on Kumar. He was rushed to a hospital with 80% burn injuries and breathed his last after a few hours. Sonam also sustained minor burn injuries while throwing the acid. She, too, is undergoing treatment, police said. Superintendent of police (SP) Botre Rohan Pramod added, “An FIR has been registered against the woman under section 326-A (voluntarily causing grievous hurt by use of acid) and 302 (murder) of IPC. Further investigations are on. She has been placed under arrest.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/month-before-wedding-man-killed-in-acid-attack-by-jealous-girlfriend/articleshow/81694474.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

The MP also demanded formation of an independent board for the development, preservation, security and research of such heritage sites across the country in order to attract more tourists from across the globe and boost local as well as the country’s economy. Claiming that in the past week, tourism ministry-related issues were discussed in the House, Karad demanded improved air connectivity for Aurangabad which is the tourism capital of Maharashtra. He said that it is an irrefutable fact that tourism plays an important role in the overall economy of our country. “The Ajanta caves are about 2,500 years old, while the Ellora caves are around 2,000 years old. These reflect the rich heritage culture of Budhism, Hinduism and Jainism,” Karad said. “The tourism sector generates large-scale employment. Hence, special attention should be given to these two world heritage sites. Each year, around 25 lakh tourists visit Ajanta and Ellora caves. There is a need fora better infrastructure and connectivity for these two heritage sites so that more and more tourists can come here,” he added. Kara demanded that there is a need for starting a cultural festival for the promotion of these heritage sites, in addition to introducing sound and light shows, construction of a helipad, ropeway to encash on these heritage sites’ potential. “Videos highlighting these heritage sites should be made and promoted on television as well as social media platforms in different parts of the globe,” Karad said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/ajanta-ellora-devpt-issue-raised-in-rs/articleshow/81685942.cms||---

The thieves had also managed to disconnect 17 CCTV cameras and had even taken away the hard disk and VCR. The lone watchman at the temple informed the police that some people had come to the temple on March 20 and asked him in Hindi whether they could sleep inside the temple premises. When the watchman denied them permission, they went away in their vehicles. Temple authorities suspect that the thieves, a gang of four, had lunch at the temple while conducting a recce of the premises in the afternoon. Police suspect that this was the handiwork of an interstate gang of thieves. The cybercrime police have also been roped in for the case. Meanwhile, the devotees are being prohibited from entering the temple to prevent disruptions to the ongoing investigation.

---||Vijayawada||Guv nod to ordinance for second dy mayor posts||Amaravati: The state government is gearing up to conduct elections to the newly-created posts of second deputy mayor for municipal corporations and second vice-chairperson for municipalities. This, after governor Biswabhushan Harichandan gave his approval to the ordinance to create these new positions. The government had decided to create these additional posts after YSRC’s sweeping victories in the recently-concluded urban local body elections. The ordinance was proposed to give representation to key communities by granting them additional posts wherever they could not get the chance to head the civic body due to local political equations. The elections to posts of mayors, deputy mayors, chairpersons, and vice-chairpersons were held on March 18 as per the schedule prepared by the state election commission. The government had then announced it would go for filling up the additional posts immediately after getting the governor’s approval to the ordinance. With incumbent state election commissioner (SEC) Nimmagadda Ramesh Kumar unlikely to hold any further elections before demitting office next week, ruling party functionaries have to wait for the appointment of the new SEC to issue the notification for holding elections to the newly-created posts. Members of the council, including ex-officio members, will have voting rights to elect the deputy mayor and vice-chairperson. YSRC had granted 10 of the 11 mayor posts to backward communities and deputy posts to either SC or locally-dominant upper-caste community. It is now looking to accommodate representatives from the second-most dominant communities in the newly-created positions. While deputy mayors and vice-chairpersons will not be burdened with additional responsibility, the move is seen as a means to keep dominant communities content in their respective cities and towns. Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy is believed to have directed in-charge ministers to spare the second deputy post in civic bodies to corporators or councillors from SC or minority communities. Meanwhile, municipal administration minister Botcha Satyanarayana directed all commissioners to convene the first council meeting with newly-elected members before March, 29 and take their inputs for development.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/guv-nod-to-ordinance-for-second-dy-mayor-posts/articleshow/81694457.cms||Samdani MN
---||Vijayawada||19 lives lost since Dec but no lessons learnt, overloaded autos continue to ply across AP||Vijayawada: Overloading autorickshaws continues to be a problem in Krishna district. Despite accidents, deaths and awareness programmes, a section of autorickshaw drivers remain indifferent to the risk of overloading their vehicles. In recent weeks, a mishap due to overloading of an autorickshaw at Talvaipadu village in Nellore district claimed two lives. According to reports, at least 19 people have died due to autorickshaw overloading caused accidents since December. Further, the problem of overloading is not limited to autos. Tractors too indulge in the same. “No one can forget the tractor mishap on May 14 last year in Prakasam district which claimed the lives of nine farm labourers,” a senior police official recalled. Officials point out that a quest to save money propels the practice of overloading vehicles. Lack of strong penalties against overloaded vehicles is one of the reasons behind the practice, said an official adding that some passengers are willing to pay the fine as it is cheaper than hiring another vehicle considering the high fuel prices. Speaking to TOI, Krishna district SP M Ravindranath Babu said that the police are going to conduct a week-long drive against overloaded vehicles in coming weeks. Overloaded autorickshaws are usually occupied by farm labourers and school-goers. While autorickshaws are not allowed to carry more than five children at a time, the rule does not see much enforcement. Scenes of autos packed with children are ordinary on the city streets. Notwithstanding fines, brazen violation of safety rules is apparent. Several autos have fitted improvised planks opposite the passenger seat to pack in more children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/19-lives-lost-since-dec-but-no-lessons-learnt-overloaded-autos-continue-to-ply-across-ap/articleshow/81694575.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti
---||Nashik||Angry villagers lock up Baglan MLA||Nashik: Residents of the Kersane village in Satana taluka of Nashik district on Wednesday allegedly locked up Baglan MLA Dileep Borse demanding immediate restoration of the power supply. Talking to TOI, the MLA admitted that the residents had indeed locked him up as they were furious about their power supply being snapped by the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company three days ago. The BJP MLA was on a tour of the villages after two consecutive days of hailstorms and unseasonal rain had caused crop loss. The residents gheraoed him and demanded immediate reconnection of power supply. “The MLA came to our village to meet us. The climatic conditions have taken a toll on our standing crops. At the same time, the MSEDCL has disconnected the power for agricultural connections,” said Rajesh Desle, a resident of Kersane. The villagers pointed out that the state government had said the electricity consumers would be given some relief and had stopped disconnections when the assembly session had began. However, on the last day, it allowed the MSECDL to disconnect the power. “The MLA represents us and we will seek justice from him. He has to listen to us. For the past three years, the farmers have been losing crops to unseasonal rain. From where will we get the money to pay the dues?” asked Rajesh Borse, a farmer. The MLA said he held no grudge against the farmers. “I came there at 12.30 pm and was discussing the farmers’ issues. We were at the gram panchayat office. The farmers would just not listen to my assurances and then locked me up,” he said. During the one-hour period when he was locked up, the MLA called up the MSEDCL officials who sent a team to the village and reconnected the 15 distribution points. “I stand with the farmers and will be raising the issue with the state government,” said Borse, adding that there was no question of lodging a complaint. The police, however, had arrived on the scene on being informed of the incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/angry-villagers-lock-up-baglan-mla/articleshow/81685950.cms||Abhilash Botekar

With a near perfect percentile of 99.9946424, Ifrah now plans to better her score in the JEE April exam. This time, the JEE is being in four sessions — February, March, April and May. Yash Kawade grabbed the probable second spot in Vidarbha with a 99.9552490 percentile, followed by Ayush Shrivastava who scored 99.9396857 percentile. The word ‘probable’ is being used for Yash and Ayush because their rankings are based solely on information being provided voluntarily by either coaching classes, colleges or parents. But Ifrah’s rank, due to it being a national-level score, was confirmed directly by the exam conducting body National Testing Agency (NTA) which announced the results on Wednesday night. Ifrah said, “My coaching was done at my school, Indian Olympiad School, both my brothers coached me.” Her brothers, former IIT-ians, are also teachers in the family-owned school. “Apart from my brothers there were other teachers who guided me every step of the way so that I could crack this tough exam,” she said. According to Ifrah, the exam’s difficulty level was moderate and she did not find any subject difficult. “Furthermore, I am preparing for JEE Advanced and I’m entirely focused on the same,” she said. Yash said the training at ICAD helped him clear the concepts. “I also focused more on NCERT and tried to avoid silly mistakes in this attempt. I studied a minimum 8-10 hours daily for better understanding of concepts. I believe that Maths was a little difficult in the exam conducted in March, as compared to February’s exam.” Ayush said for JEE preparations, his teachers at Allen Coaching Institute (Nagpur) helped him a lot. “They cleared all doubts in the online classes. The exam was not difficult though I found Maths to be lengthy this time. I am aiming enter IIT, Powai, and entirely focusing on the same.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/citys-ifrah-third-in-india-among-girls-in-jee-main/articleshow/81694514.cms||---
---||Noida||Noida: Gaursons to finish 11,000 Amrapali flats in 3 yrs||NOIDA: The government-backed National Buildings Construction Corporation (NBCC) has awarded a tender of Rs 2,124 crore to city-based builder Gaursons for completing around 11,000 flats at four Amrapali projects — Verona Heights, Heartbeat City phases I and II and Amrapali Centurian Park. NBCC has been assigned the task of completing 23 housing projects of Amrapali. The estimated cost of completing these projects is about Rs 8,500 crore. The company has been financing the construction through loans and dues cleared by buyers. Gaursons said it would complete and hand over the 11,000-odd flats in three years. “We have bagged the project worth Rs 2,124 crore and preliminary work has started on it. We will complete the construction and hand over all 10,964 flats in 36 months,” said Manoj Gaur, the chairperson of Gaursons. “The number of pending flats is huge and we are now responsible for a part of it. We have started work and will meet all deadlines. We are coming on board as only a construction company,” he added. Sarthak Gaur, the director of Gaurs Group, said the company would now fully focus on completing the Amrapali flats. “We have no large-scale real estate projects as of now and have sold a majority of our under-construction inventory. So, we are now focusing on our construction portfolio. In the Amrapali projects, we will execute the construction, but the responsibility of sales remains with NBCC,” he said. Asked about the funding, Sarthak Gaur said, “We will raise a monthly bill to NBCC, depending on the construction. We are meeting the construction cost through internal accruals and bank guarantees. The projects will be completed within 36 months of the allotment of the tender.” Gaursons is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Gaurs Group. Amrapali has a total of 46,575 flats in various projects, of which, 8,416 were registered in January. NBCC has been given the responsibility of constructing 38,159 flats, of which 5,229 units are still unsold. It was the Supreme Court that had on August 2, 2018, ordered the government construction company to complete the pending flats of Amrapali group. The financial matters and the responsibility of completing the entire project are being supervised by the court receiver, R Venkatramani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/gaursons-to-finish-11k-amrapali-flats-in-3-yrs/articleshow/81696864.cms||Sharmila Bhowmick

According to reliable sources, officials are preparing the final report to be submitted to the government and will be holding some top officials in the temple management including the EO responsible for some of the irregularities. Sources said they would be seeking explanation on some of the irregularities mainly pertaining to the tender process. ACB had conducted checks for three days across seven wings — prasadam counter, saree auction counter, establishment, ticket counter, sanitation, protocol section, IT and security systems wings. After inspection, the endowment department suspended 15 temple staffers, including five superintendent-rank officials for alleged irregularities and causing loss to exchequer based on the preliminary report submitted by the ACB. Three days ago, the executive officer transferred 11 staff members across the above mentioned seven wings. Suresh Babu also stated that these transfers were made after several complaints of corruption and irregularities were being made.

---||Madurai||Few choices for these ‘forsaken’ cracker biz workers||Virudhunagar: For 35-year-old Selvarani, every morning dawns with a haze of uncertainty about making ends meet. She is among the lakhs employed in the fireworks industry in Virudhunagar district who face frequent loss of employment following the tightening of environmental rules on fireworks manufacture. Even if there was work, they are paid meagre salaries and are forced to work in unsafe conditions which have taken away 36 lives in the last six weeks alone. Despite being a votebank in the three assembly segments of Virudhunagar, Sivakasi and Sattur, workers are cut up with the major parties for turning a blind eye towards their teething troubles.Workers say it is virtually a fait accompli for them. While the AIADMK manifesto promises virtually nothing, DMK has given a few assurances linked to MSMEs and wick (cracker fuse) manufacture, skipping their key demands. “Nothing has changed in the seven years since I started going to work. I have been getting the same Rs 150 to Rs 300 a day, but the prices of essential commodities have been increasing from time to time,” says Selvarani. Minister for milk and dairy development K T Rajenthra Bhalaji won from his native constituency Sivakasi in the 2011 and 2016 assembly elections. Though he claims he is contesting from Rajapalayam this time bowing to request from people, many say he was forced to switch seats because of the general dissatisfaction of the local people with his inaction on various issues. Bhalaji has also been claiming that a sage from Thiruvannamalai district had asked him to contest in a constituency which starts with 'Ra'.CITU district secretary P N Deva told TOI that nearly 4.25 lakh people of the 8 lakh workers in cracker units in the district are natives. A permanent solution to safeguard the industry is to exempt fireworks from the Environment (Protection) Act. However, the present government did not take steps in this regard and even the election manifestos of both the major parties are devoid of any promises. Due to the strict implementation of rules following recent accidents, most cracker units in the district remain closed now. Hence, lakhs of workers have been migrating to nearby districts to work in mills or as daily wagers. V Muthiah, who has been working in a cracker unit for the past 15 years, said the units are forced to close down for a major portion of the year due to the new rules and regulations. Steps should be taken to provide them continuous employment. “It has been our long-pending demand to implement minimum wages, but no steps have been taken in this regard so far,” he said. —————————————————Inputs for graphics:Number of key constituencies:VirudhunagarNumber of voters - 2,24,327SivakasiNumber of voters - 2,60,941SatturNumber of voters - 2,51,502Number of workers employed:Number of workers directly employed - nearly 5lakhNumber of workers indirectly employed - nearly 3lakhNumber of workers from other districts - nearly 2.75lakhNumber of voters (fireworks unit workers) - nearly 4.25lakhKey Demands:To exempt fireworks from the Environment (Protection) Act to safeguard the industry.Minimum wages for workersProviding continuous employment throughout the yearTo put in place a system to provide compensation in case of deathsAwareness to workers to ensure zero accidentsEnds||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/few-choices-for-these-forsaken-cracker-biz-workers/articleshow/81695350.cms||Kaushik Kannan

Though the number of woman voters has increased in the country — from 46.7% in the 1962 Lok Sabha polls to 67.18% in 2019 general elections — the share in participation of women has neither increased in politics nor in legislative houses, he observed. “India is far behind as per Inter Parliamentary Union’s data on women’s participation in national parliaments across the world. India was at 95th spot in 1998 but has now dropped to 148,” he said. He cited the example of AP where 60% of women were elected to mayor and chairperson posts in the recent ULB polls. “Around 78,000 out of 1.5 lakh seats were won by women, which indicates that reservations are a must to provide more opportunity to women to take part in democratic process,” Vijayasai said.

While the number of cases reported from zone four is slightly lesser than zone one and two, zone three has the least number of cases, only around 8%. Of the 43 fresh Covid-19 cases reported on Thursday, 29 were from Madurai city. As many as 219 cases have been reported in the city in the last 15 days, officials said. Officials said that zone three mostly has middle class families, who follow precautionary measures to an extent. People from the lower rung of the society do not bother to follow the precautionary measures as their livelihood is at stake, while higher class people tend to travel more, which is resulting in higher infection rates among them. “We cannot predict much based on the initial numbers. No clusters have emerged so far. Mostly, cases are spreading due to exposure to crowds in functions, festivals and political gatherings,” a source from the health department in Madurai Corporation said. However, the corporation is yet to restrict the movement of people in the families, who have been tested positive for Covid-19. V P Manikandan, a social activist, said, “People cannot withstand another round of stringent lockdown as people are already suffering due to poverty and job loss. Prevention of the spread of Covid-19 is the best way forward,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madurai-corpns-zone-i-ii-report-most-cases/articleshow/81695357.cms||V Devanathan

The court was hearing the appeal preferred by Soundarya challenging the order of a single judge who dismissed her plea seeking medical admission under the 7.5% quota. During the previous hearing, the state informed the court that a BDS seat has been kept vacant pursuant to the interim order of the single judge and they are willing to sponsor the medical aspirant. A division bench of justices M M Sundresh and S Ananthi observed that the appellant belongs to the scheduled caste community and she did study from Class I to Class X in a government school. She was sponsored by the government to have her higher secondary education in a private school, because of her good performance in the Class X examinations. “We make it clear that this order may not be treated as a precedent, as we are dealing with the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case,” said the judges. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-orders-dental-seat-for-girl-under-7-5-quota/articleshow/81695354.cms||---

The inference can be drawn from the latest report released by real estate consulants Anarock.In NCR, Gurgaon tops the list among NCR cities with a sales increase of 16% on a year-on-year basis. During January-March 2021, some 2,780 flats were sold in Gurgaon as compared to 2,400 during the same period last year. Noida, on the other hand, tops the list of launches at 66% on a YOY basis. However, Gurgaon’s property launches witnessed a sharp dip of 33% for the same period. In Q1 2020, 4,580 units were launched, while this year, the figure was 3,060, as per the report. Explaining this upswing in sales, Anuj Puri, chairman of Anarock, said, “Demand boosters like stamp duty cuts, further reductions in home loan rates by most banks and ongoing developer discounts and offers helped the residential sector stage a convincing comeback in Q1 2021.”The report said Greater Noida saw a 3% dip in sales. The city sold 2,490 units in January-March this year compared to last year’s 1,370. Ghaziabad has made a 1% increase in sales and clocked 1,390 units during the same period this year compared to last year’s 1,370.

---||Bareilly||UP: Teen sister sees sibling ‘violated’ by 3, both killed||PILIBHIT: When the younger sister, 18, walked in on her elder sister, 20, being "violated" by three men, she was strangled and then her sister was hanged to death, the girls’ family had said in their complaint to the police. But on Thursday, police said again that it was a case of honour killing, arrested the girls’ mother, elder brother and owner of the brick kiln where the family worked, and booked the girls’ younger brother and their elder brother’s brother-in-law. In a complaint to the police, the girls’ younger brother had alleged that the brick kiln owner, manager and contractor had coerced his elder sister into physical relationships with them. “They would rape her. On that night, my younger sister saw the three of them together. The accused strangled her, afraid she would tell people. Then, they hanged my elder sister from a tree to eliminate all evidence,” said the complaint. The FIR, however, does not mention any of this. It charges an unidentified person with murder and causing disappearance of evidence and includes a complaint which says how the girls went missing and were found dead. “Police didn’t register the FIR on the basis of the complaint we filed,” the girls’ sister-in-law told TOI. Police said this was because an FIR had already been filed before the complaint came in. “An FIR had been registered after a complaint by the brother when the girls were buried, on Wednesday. A second FIR cannot be filed in the same case. I have asked the Pilibhit SP to include the complaint in the investigation,” IG (Bareilly range) Rajesh Pandey told TOI. Earlier in the day, the SP, Jai Prakash Yadav, had in a press conference said the girls’ “frequent phone conversations” with two boys was why they were killed by their family. “The girls were beaten up by their mother on March 22, asking them who they were involved with … When they didn’t tell her, the two brothers held their sisters’ feet while the mother strangled them,” the SP said. “One of them did not die immediately. She was hanged by her two brothers.” Asked why the brick kiln owner was booked, SP Yadav told TOI, “We have charged the brick kiln owner, Ali Hassan with causing disappearance of evidence, criminal conspiracy and intentional omission to give information because he got to know about the murder at 10.55pm when he got a 400-second call from a (labour) contractor, Ramdas. Then, he received another 200-second call. But he didn’t tell us about either. Instead, he advised the accused (the girls’ family) to dump the body.” Ramdas has not been booked and, instead, been made a witness in the case. In the village where the girls lived, some 14 families are packed tightly into mud hovels around lines of bricks laid out to dry. When TOI visited the village, neighbours said they got to know something was wrong that day when they heard the family wailing. “We didn’t hear any commotion and did not see them beating anyone up. They were crying when they found one of the dead bodies. That’s when we knew something had happened,” said Mahesh, who lives right next to them. Another neighbour, Kaudilal, said the same: “I was having dinner when I heard the family crying. I rushed to find one of the girls lying dead. They had just found the body.” The spot where the other body was found, hanging from a tree, is across the state highway that runs by their settlement, next to the brick kiln where they work, about a kilometre from their house.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/badaun-rerun-younger-sis-saw-elder-sibling-violated-by-3-both-killed-after-that-says-family/articleshow/81693721.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Noida||Too costly? Noida, Greater Noida fail to find buyers for ready flats||NOIDA/GREATER NOIDA: Signifying an overall slowdown in the local real estate market, ready-to-move-in flats being offered by the industrial development authorities in Noida and Greater Noida are also struggling to find takers. Having been on the block for six months now, the authorities could sell just a handful of flats to date. In various schemes and offers, the Noida Authority and the Greater Noida Authority floated a total of 1,835 flats during the current fiscal, which is drawing to a close within a week. However, despite their best efforts, only 45 odd flats have been sold so far, TOI has learnt. The scenario in the twin cities is in sharp contrast to what had been witnessed in Delhi.  The Delhi Development Authority earlier this year launched 1,354 flats. More than 22,000 homebuyers queued up after paying up the registration fees to bag the DDA flats. According to market experts, the problem is with the price points and the ticket size of the units that are being marketed by the two authorities. “Due to lack of trust on developers in Noida and Greater Noida, the schemes of the two authorities should have got a similar response that was witnessed in Delhi. But the authorities are commanding a steep premium, which is unacceptable to buyers,” said Pankaj Kapoor of real estate analytics firm Liases Foras. Buyers who have been house hunting agree with the view of the experts. An IT executive who stays on rent in Sector 74’s Supertech Capetown, Prashant Yadav has been looking for a ready-to-move-in property for the past two months. “I checked the properties being offered by the two authorities. The per square foot rate of such properties is almost double of what private developers are offering. Plus one gets a swimming pool, club house and other facilities in private apartments.” While the Greater Noida Authority is offering 1,480 flats, the Noida Authority floated 355 units in ground plus three storey buildings in August. The Greater Noida Authority launched an open-ended scheme, while Noida Authority closed its scheme within a period of two months. Officials of Noida Authority said that not a single flat could be sold even though they had offered low-income, middle-income and higher-income categories across multiple sectors. Noida Authority’s MIG flat in Sector 62 having an area of about 1,000 sq ft was priced at Rs 66.44 lakh while its HIG flat in Sector 99 spread over 1,650 sqft was worth Rs 1.62 crore. Chief executive officer of the Noida Authority, Ritu Maheshwari said that rates of the units have been fixed as per the prevailing land rate. “We will apprise senior officials of the response. Right now we do not intend to revise the rates of these apartments.” Greater Noida Authority has been offering 1BHK, 2BHK and 3BHK of different configurations across various sectors. While the average price of 3BHKs (carpet area of 1,103 sq ft) is in the range of Rs 84 lakh, the 2BHK with study (carpet area of 727 sq ft) is priced at Rs 52 lakh.

Financial analysts speaking to TOI concurred that though an attempt has been made by the chief minister to promote self employment in villages, the budget clearly lacked any impetus to rural development that was so pronounced in the last budget. Financial analysts had hailed the last year’s budget as “a shift from an urban-focused budget to one with a rural orientation”. “The chief minister seems to have forgotten his last year’s emphasis on rural development. Regularising Alvara land rights of locals is, however, a welfare step,” management consultant Rajendra Kakodkar told TOI. The budget, nevertheless, has proposed to set up shops for selling the produce of self-help groups in collaboration with NABARD, for promoting self-employment. “Towards this, I propose to construct Goa Bazar at Merces at an estimated total cost of Rs 53 crore, for allowing selling opportunities to our self-help groups,” Sawant said. The government has also proposed to provide all BPL families with LPG connections to minimise the use of firewood under the “Goa Grameen Urja Yojana”. Besides, an allocation of Rs 15 crore has also been made to the “Goa Gram Samruddhi Yojana” to create infrastructure in rural areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/unlike-last-year-no-focus-on-rural-goa-in-this-budget/articleshow/81696166.cms||---
---||Pune||Centre has sent 8.29 crore vaccine doses, 12 crore more coming||PUNE: Officials from the health ministry on Thursday said the government has dispatched 8.29 crore doses of Covishield and Covaxin to the states. Another 12 crore doses are set to be delivered by both companies within the next two months, they added. Ministry officials also said both Serum Institute (producing Covishield) and Bharat Biotech (producing Covaxin) will be asked to scale up vaccine production to match demand as and when the Covid vaccination programme expands to cover more citizens. The government has already added everyone over 45 years of age to the vaccination plan and officials maintained that the country will have enough doses for all. Centre has sent 8.29cr doses, 12cr more comingWith some states raising concerns of supply shortages, authorities said state governments should first focus on covering districts or regions that are seeing a high number of cases or where antibody prevalence has been low. A source from the health ministry said, “States should know their susceptible groups before carrying out the vaccination drive. They should focus on these areas and populations first, instead of complaining about vaccine shortages. They can use sero survey data to determine which regions have the most susceptible population. The idea is to vaccinate the most susceptible first and then move on to others. Local authorities have to use their discretion.” Ministry officials said doses are being ordered and dispatched regularly as per requirements placed by the states. But there have been claims of shortages. Maharashtra, for instance, has demanded 2.2 crore vaccine doses at a supply rate of 20 lakh doses a week. On Wednesday, officials said the state's reserves may last only about a week more. And there are at least nine districts recording worryingly high caseloads. But central government sources said the primary aim of the vaccination programme was to disrupt the Covid transmission chain. It is then necessary for states to "carpet bomb" priority districts with the vaccines instead of using the shots as "water sprinklers", officials said. Meanwhile, experts said more sites should be added. Dr Lalit Kant, former head of epidemiology and communicable Diseases, ICMR, said, “It's believed there are 30-35 crore people in the 45+ age group. At the current rate, it would take us several years to give them all two doses. We need 50,000 daily sessions and if one covers 100 persons, 50 lakh people can be vaccinated every day. In two days then, we should be able to administer one crore doses. Private sector role has to increase in a big way."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/centre-has-dispatched-8-29-crore-doses-so-far-12-crore-more-coming/articleshow/81695368.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The NGT initiated proceedings on the receipt of a letter from civic activist K Lakshma Reddy and registered a suo motu case in 2018. Reddy alleged that untreated effluents were being discharged by Frigerio Conserva Allana Ltd, Zaheerabad, Piramal Enterprises at Digwal in Kohir mandal and Sri Siddi Vinayaka Oil Mills in Zaheerabad, thereby adversely effecting the water quality and availability of groundwater and drinking water to residents of the surrounding areas. The NGT in its order on Wednesday said: “We feel it appropriate to grant a conditional stay of enforcing the order on condition that the appellant will deposit 50 per cent of EC impugned within a period of two months with the Telangana State Pollution Control Board. On such deposit, the PCB is directed to deposit the amount in a nationalised bank for six months so that in case the amount has to be returned, then the appellant should be entitled to get interest accrued on the deposit.” The PCB is also directed to produce the proof of deposit of the amount as directed by the tribunal for a period of six months before the next hearing date. Earlier, the NGT principal bench in October 2018 had directed the PCB and the Sangareddy district collector to look into the charges of water pollution and submit a report. The PCB submitted an action taken report along with the report of the multi-disciplinary team.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ngt-refuses-blanket-stay-on-ec-to-be-paid-by-piramal/articleshow/81695373.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

Around 25 jallikattu protesters came to Madurai district court to appear for a case registered against them in connection with the jallikattu protest that took place in 2017. Talking to reporters, they said that chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami had made an announcement in the assembly in February that cases registered against them would be withdrawn, but it turned out to be a gimmick as they were not withdrawn yet. They said that only because of the protest, the government brought in an ordinance, which helped the resumption of jallikattu. The protestors should be treated like freedom fighters, they said. Activist Mugilan, who was one of the protestors and appeared in court, said the Tamil Nadu Bovine Breeding Act, 2019 which was implemented by the state government is posing a threat to indigenous bulls. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/jallikattu-protesters-call-to-vote-against-aiadmk-govt/articleshow/81695377.cms||---

---||Goa||Goa govt to pump in crores to expedite water projects||PANAJI: Though some may choose to disagree, chief minister Pramod Sawant on Wednesday, while presenting his budget, said that Goa is known across the country for its 100% tap connectivity. Stating that it is now time to move a step further, Sawant announced that Rs 200 crore will be pumped under the central government’s Jal Jeevan Mission to streamline the overall water supply in Goa. The chief minister said the government will try to reduce the bill paid by domestic water consumers and also give concessions to consumers to take connections to sewerage treatment network. Water supply to Tiswadi and Ponda will be improved by upgrading the raw water pumping station at Ganjem on Mhadei River to augment its capacity from 35MLD storage to 100MLD for Opa water works, Sawant said. Work on water treatment plants at Porvorim and Ganjem at Rs 135 crore will be expedited, he added. “Porvorim plant is likely to be commissioned by April 30, 2021,” the chief minister said. Sawant also said that all works under JICA will finally see completion by October 2021. “Basic facilities are a fundamental right of the citizen. Even when our government was going through financial strain, I have not let this come in the way of providing basic facilities to the people,” Sawant said. Water treatment plants totalling to 150MLD at Chandel, Selaulim, Canacona, Tuem, among others, will be taken up. “The vision of my government to provide 100 LPCD (litres per capita per day) for rural areas and 150 LPCD for urban areas will be achieved,” the chief minister promised. The present sewerage network coverage in Goa is 16% and the coverage is currently being enhanced upto 28% under the sewerage corporation, he said. Other works proposed to ensure consistent water availability include the proposal for construction of 15MLD raw water pumping station at Guirim and construction of barrage on Khandepar River for drinking water to Priol constituency. To provide uninterrupted raw water supply to Bardez taluka, it is planned to lay a 23km pipeline from Tillari dam to the Goa border. This will cost nearly Rs 122 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-to-pump-in-crores-to-expedite-water-projects/articleshow/81696178.cms||---

However, schools are also wary of rising Covid-19 cases and hope there is no delay in conduct of the board exams. “For both Class X and XII, definitely there is a need for physical classes when board exams are to be conducted. For the sake of practical classes and practical exams, conducting physical classes is necessary,” said L Selvakumari, principal, Kenbridge CBSE School. Practical exams are being conducted for CBSE students between March and June. With a lot of time available, schools are confident of holding it in a phased manner and completing it. Practical exams are to be conducted with the presence of an external observer. K Ramya, a Class X student from a CBSE school in Madurai, said that having practical classes and practising writing exams is vital for preparation. “It would have been really frustrating if we were asked to shift to online classes at this crucial time. The exams must also be conducted without delay and not leave students anxious,” she added. Teachers further said that despite online classes, Class X, XII CBSE students have struggled to score well in the revision tests conducted recently and required more practice. “When other public places are fully functional, students coming to school shouldn’t be an issue when Covid-19 safety SOPs are being followed,” said Barath Silvester Raj, dean, Sri Aurobindo Mira Group of Educational Institutions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/schools-wary-of-covid-physical-classes-for-x-xii/articleshow/81695393.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Vikas was referred to the district hospital as his condition was critical. His father, Madan Lal, said the leopard suddenly came out of the forest and pounced on the two children. Hearing their screams, people rushed to their aid. Seeing a crowd, the leopard slipped away. Naveen Khandelwal, deputy director of the Pilibhit tiger reserve, said the pugmarks, though smudged by the movement of several villagers, confirmed the presence of a leopard.

Her decision to move cities paid off as she emerged as one of the toppers in the second phase of JEE (Main). The results were announced on Wednesday night. Bakshi and another student from Delhi are probably among the very few girls to bag a perfect score in JEE (Main). Vashi’s Atharva Tambat (18) too bagged the perfect 100 in the second phase. Both students attempted the test for the second time after falling short of their desired score in the first attempt in February. JEE (Main) will be conducted four times this year. Bakshi and Tambat are among the 13 students in the country to score 100 percentile in the March exam. Tambat, a student of Ryan International School in Sanpada, scored 99.97 percentile in February. “I was not happy with my Chemistry scores and the next exam was scheduled in just 20 days. So, I brushed up on my chemistry and attempted the test again,” he said. He scored full marks in all three subjects in the second attempt. Though he is keen on joining an IIT, he has not made up his mind on the branch of engineering. His father is an engineer and mother a homemaker. He took a break of two years from his interests in table tennis and drawing. Bakshi, too, like Tambat, was unhappy with her Chemistry scores and decided to attempt again. Her father, oral surgeon Dr Makarand Bakshi said, “Her grandmother stayed in Dadar, so we had an option.” Gargi, a student of Pace Junior Science College, Dadar, is keen on pursuing computer science from IIT-Bombay and like Tambat is now focused on the preparation for JEE (Advanced).

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: HC says bank got back Rs 300cr, gives bail to Deepak Kochhar||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Thursday granted bail to Deepak Kochhar, husband of former ICICI Bank CEO Chanda Kochhar, in a money laundering case under investigation by the Enforcement Directorate (ED). As he directed Kochhar’s release on a personal bond of Rs 3 lakh, Justice P D Naik observed that a loan of Rs 300 crore was repaid in its entirety to ICICI Bank and no loss was caused to it. The high court observed that the loan was repaid before the registration of the FIR by the CBI and initiation of the proceedings under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). Kochhar must surrender his passport and visit the ED once a month. Of the 11 accused in the ED case, Kochhar was the only one arrested, in September. The 59-year-old is likely to complete his bail formalities and get released by the weekend, said his lawyer. Senior counsel Amit Desai, appearing for Kochhar and arguing for his bail, cited the findings of a November 6, 2020, PMLA adjudicating authority order that had in effect “exonerated” him in the adjudication proceedings. The high court factored the dismissal by the authority of the original complaint under PMLA while granting bail. The high court said an appeal was pending with a status quo order. The authority in an 800-page order had declined the ED plea to confirm its provisional attachment of Kochhar’s pricy flat in the CCI building at Churchgate in south Mumbai, saying it was not involved in money laundering. It had also rejected an ED plea to attach various wind power assets belonging to Nupower Renewables (Pvt) Ltd (NRL), which Deepak Kochhar founded, and its subsidiaries. The high court recorded Desai’s submissions that no loans to Videocon were sanctioned independently by Chanda Kochhar and there was nothing to connect the allegation that V N Dhoot of Videocon transferred Rs 64 crore to NRL as undue benefit. Desai said the offence Kochhar was accused of under the PMLA attracted seven years in jail and he could not be incarcerated indefinitely under the pretext of further investigation by the ED. The ED, through additional solicitor general S V Raju with SPP Hiten Venegaonkar, had opposed his plea, pointing to its November 3, 2002, chargesheet. The ED argued that economic offences were to be viewed seriously and said that under PMLA Act it would be presumed that proceeds of crime were involved in money laundering unless the contrary was proved. In January 2019, the CBI filed a case of cheating and criminal conspiracy under the IPC and criminal misconduct under the Prevention of Corruption Act against Kochhar and his wife, among others, for allegedly causing losses to ICICI Bank by sanctioning loans to Videocon Group in contravention of the bank’s rules and policies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-says-bank-got-back-rs-300cr-gives-bail-to-deepak-kochhar/articleshow/81696191.cms||---

A bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and S Ravindra Bhat said the fervent plea made by Mukhim in her FB post for protection of non-tribals in Meghalaya and for their equality cannot, by any stretch of imagination, be categorised as hate speech. The analysis of her post shows no case of hate speech is made out, it said. “Disapprobation of governmental inaction can’t be branded as an attempt to promote hatred between different communities, it said. Free speech of the citizens of this country cannot be stifled by implicating them in criminal cases, unless such speech has the tendency to affect public order,” the bench said. It said India is a plural and multicultural society and the promise of liberty, enunciated in the Preamble, manifests itself in various provisions which outline each citizen’s rights; including right to free speech, to travel freely and settle throughout the length and breadth of India. Justice Rao, who wrote the verdict on behalf of the bench said: “At times, when in the legitimate exercise of such a right, individuals travel, settle down or carry on a vocation in a place where they find conditions conducive, there may be resentments, especially if such citizens prosper, leading to hostility or possibly violence.” “In such instances, if the victims voice their discontent, and speak out, especially if the state authorities turn a blind eye, or drag their feet, such voicing of discontent is really a cry for anguish, for justice denied - or delayed. This is exactly what appears to have happened in this case.” The SC said that a close scrutiny of the Facebook post would indicate that the agony of Mukhim was directed against the apathy shown by the Meghalaya CM, the DGP and the Dorbar Shnong of the area in not taking any action against the culprits who attacked the non-tribal youngsters. “For the aforementioned reasons, the appeal is allowed and the judgment of the high court is set aside. FIR...dated July 6, 2020 registered at police station Laban is quashed,” the bench said. Dealing with the post written by Mukhim, it said, “The appellant referred to the attacks on non-tribals in 1979. At the most, the Facebook post can be understood to highlight the discrimination against non-tribals in Meghalaya.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-quashes-patricia-fir-says-free-speech-cant-be-stifled-by-criminal-cases/articleshow/81698304.cms||---

---||Goa||Cong: Sawant’s budget is full of old promises||Panaji: The state budget presented by chief minister Pramod Sawant for 2021-22 is full of hollow promises and is an attempt by BJP to fool people ahead of the 2022 assembly elections, said state Congress president Girish Chodankar. Chodankar said that the state government has not made any provision for the 11,000 government jobs, which suggests that the jobs, along with other budget promises, will never see the light of day. “It is evident that BJP government has used the budget not for development, but electoral benefit,” Chodankar said. “Many schemes announced earlier are repeated again in this budget. It is imaginary and unrealistic without any serious thinking.” Congress said that Sawant has rehashed schemes and policies already announced by his predecessors. Chodankar said that Sawant’s decision to restart the Goemche Daiz scheme for traditional occupations is a welcome move, but he was quick to point out that the scheme had been prepared and notified by Congress government. “The CM, in the past, had announced plans to create 10,000 jobs, but he failed to provide them. Now his new promise of creating 11,000 jobs will require Rs 396 crore per annum to pay salaries. But there is no provision made in the budget for the same, hence it is clear that this announcement is another ‘jumla’ to woo youth,” Chodankar said. Establishment of Eklavya Model Residential School at Arla Keri, gaushalas, palliative cancer care and contract job security are some of the promises made by earlier governments. Chodankar also alleged that the new excise policy will kill the liquor industry of Goa. “This excise policy is done at the behest of the Maharashtra and Karnataka liquor lobby,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cong-sawants-budget-is-full-of-old-promises/articleshow/81696206.cms||---

The country will have polls in West Bengal, Assam, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. “This has been the past experience as rates of petrol and diesel are never hiked during state polls in any part of the country,” he told TOI. —Somit Sen||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-fuel-rates-dip-petrol-stays-off-rs-100-mark/articleshow/81696213.cms||Somit Sen

The government is running on loans and is just pushing the state into a debt trap, the party stated. Mhambre said the industry which is under tremendous burden of inflation and low business environment has no relief whatsoever from the BJP government in Goa. “The common man who has suffered job loss and is faced with high utility bills like power and water has also not got any relief from the government,” he said.  “The least the government could have done is reduced the fuel prices which has not happened and because the inflation is going to be up,” Mhambre said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/aap-budget-is-a-bag-of-lies-and-jumlas/articleshow/81696210.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Lucknow: PGI director, wife test Covid positive over a month after 2nd vaccine shot||LUCKNOW: SGPGIMS director Prof RK Dhiman and 10 staff members of Avanti Bai Women’s Hospital, including two doctors, were among 11 healthcare workers who tested Covid-19 positive on Thursday. Of them, 10 had completed their two-dose vaccine course. While Prof Dhiman has mild symptoms of coronavirus, other patients are asymptomatic. Doctors, however, said there was no need to panic over vaccinated persons contracting the infection nor doubt the efficacy of the vaccine because it doesn’t block the entry of the virus into a human body. Instead, the vaccine develops antibodies which prepares a person in advance to fight the infection, thus preventing critical illness and saving life. Vaccine efficacy would be under doubt only when a persons gets critical despite being vaccinated, they added. In comparison, dcotors explained, if a non-vaccinated person is infected, the body’s immune system takes time to develop antibodies, which at times causes critical illness. Speaking to TOI, SGPGI director Prof Dhiman said, “My wife Praveena came positive two days ago. I tested positive on Thursday. She had fever and myalgia (body pain and tenderness) and I am experiencing fever and cough, but our symptoms are only mild as per our CT scans. “I don’t know from where exactly we picked up the virus since we both have been going to work. With just the two of us at home, we have gone into home isolation,” he added. He also tweeted an appeal “All those who came in our contact in the last seven days, please take necessary precautions.” Praveena Dhiman is also a doctor posted in the medical health and family welfare department. The couple had completed their course of Covidshield vaccine on February 18. Their workplaces have been sanitised and close contacts are being tested. Prof Dhiman also said “Being vaccinated is a boon today. The vaccine is very effective in preventing hospitalisation due to critical illness as well as deaths. At the maximum, if infected, a person develops mild symptoms.. At Avanti Bai hospital, two doctors, three lab technicians, three security guards, one ward aaya and one office clerk tested positive for Covid-19 through antigen testing method. Nine of these ten people had been vaccinated earlier. “We did an emergency c-section operation of a pregnant woman two days ago. The woman was negative in the antigen test, but later her RT-PCR test came positive. Subsequently, we shifted the patient to Queen Mary’s hospital and 234 employees tested on Thursday in which 10 came positive. Those who tested positive are asymptomatic and in home isolation. The rest of the staff will be tested on Friday,” said chief medical superintendent Dr Sudha Verma. Earlier, a doctor of SPM Civil hospital had also got infected even after completing vaccine course.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/pgi-director-wife-test-covid-positive-over-a-month-after-2nd-vaccine-shot/articleshow/81696219.cms||---

Rajendranagar police said that the victim, Ramesh, suffered injury on his hand and neck by the accused Balaiah. The victim was shifted to hospital and the accused taken into custody. The two attacking each other was captured on camera and it went viral. The accused was in possession of sickle and the victim was holding a stick, while they were attacking each other. Meanwhile, few passersby intervened and stopped them from fighting before alerting the police. When the accused was questioned by the police, he said that the fight happened over the issue of grass. Both the accused and victim make a living by selling grass to persons who are in cattle business. Ramesh and Balaiah cut grass in government lands and other areas. On Thursday, Ramesh took objection when Balaiah was cutting grass at an open place, citing that it is his jurisdiction. The accused, who was already in possession of a sickle, attacked the victim using it. “Both the accused and victim have been at loggerheads for a long time over jurisdictional issues,” Rajendranagar police said. A case was registered under section 307 (attempt to murder) of IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/fight-over-hay-leaves-one-injured/articleshow/81696209.cms||---
---||Kochi||Real issues to the fore in high-pitched poll battle||Kollam: Kundara, the land of ‘proclamation’, has never given a chance to any of the political fronts to claim monopoly. As a result, no candidate has been able to claim a hat-trick victory from here. With sitting MLA and minister for fisheries and cashew industry J Mercykutty Amma fighting it out for a second consecutive win and UDF’s P C Vishnunath aiming to wrest the seat, Kundara is set to witness a fierce battle this time. Kundara had given a comfortable majority twice to M A Baby in 2006 and 2011 when he contested to the assembly. Mercykutty Amma, who replaced Baby in 2016, romped home with a massive lead of 30,460 votes. But when the Lok Sabha elections were held in 2019, N K Premachandran could secure a lead of 24,309 in Kundara segment alone. Interestingly, there was a swing towards the Left in the 2020 local body poll as LDF secured a margin of 22,397 votes in Kundara. Mercykutty Amma was going strong at her home turf till opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala brought to light the deep sea fishing contract. Now, an unsettled Mercykutty Amma is focusing on dispelling the doubts amid the fishermen community and even among the cashew workers during her campaign. “LDF would never compromise on the interests of the fisher folk. It’s all part of a conspiracy hatched by the opposition leader and a section of priests also subscribe to the theory and issue pastoral epistle,” she told TOI. At her campaign meeting at St John’s cashew factory at Kottankara, over 200 women cashew workers received her. As she narrated the slew of welfare measures her government had undertaken for the workers, a woman asked why the government wanted to sell the sea to the corporates. “If you tell the fisher folk on the coastal belt that LDF is planning to sell the sea, they would slap you across your face,” Mercykutty Amma said apparently losing her cool. One would wonder whether a candidate could afford to tell the voters that they should show gratitude for the provision kits being distributed or the pension amount being paid without fail. “Workers can never show ingratitude. Act according to your conscience. Remember who have held you close during the days of pandemic. When the UDF was in power, your pension was pending for 18 months. But the LDF government is giving pension one month in advance. That too after clearing all the arrears,” she reminded the cashew workers. The tone and tenor of the speech were no different when she spoke at St John’s cashew factory, Poothakkuzhy. Meanwhile, the UDF candidate, P C Vishnunath, is determined to register a win. During his visit to an unauthorized cashew processing unit at Kizhavoor, Kunnumpuram near Kannanalloor in his white Toyota Etios car, there was just one pilot jeep to announce the candidate’s arrival. Though there was no large crowd of cheering workers, he seemed to have touched a chord with the crowd easily. Seeing purdah-clad women passing by, he stopped the car to tell them a few words. Catching hold of the mike in one hand and taking an aged women’s hand in the other, Vishnunath started his brief speech. “You know, majority of the 85 cashew factories are lying locked here for the past five years. Still the government claims that they have given you employment. Do you know that you are entitled to get three pensions? But you are given only the social welfare pension,” he tells the women folk much to their astonishment. However, some of them could be heard telling him that during the UDF’s time they had neither work nor pension. Asked Vishnunath about his strategy to reach out to the people, he said that his style was to interact with the people in detail and understand their problem and make it discussed. “At Kundara, there are six railway gates and those gates are closed at least 20 times a day. This could be avoided if a rail overbridge (RoB) is constructed,” he raises an issue which can catch the imagination of the middle class people. The NDA, which considers Kundara as one of its A-plus category constituencies, has allotted the seat to BDJS, which has fielded Vanaja Vidyadharan. Their election machinery got kick started only after the intervention of the BJP and RSS state leadership as majority of the BJP workers were annoyed over giving away the seat to BDJS. In the local body elections, NDA had polled 33,672 votes here.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/real-issues-to-the-fore-in-high-pitched-poll-battle/articleshow/81694576.cms||---
---||Kochi||‘LDF means Lies, Deception, Fraud’||Kochi: Lashing out at the LDF government in Kerala, AICC general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala said that it has become the short form of “lies, deception and fraud”. Addressing a press meet here in Kochi on Thursday, he alleged that the five years of CPM-led LDF rule has turned “God’s Own Country into the capital of unemployment, corruption, crime and callous health services.” “The truth is that the self-anointed ‘captain’, Pinarayi Vijayan and his team have pushed the state into an abyss of total autocracy, gross unemployment, rampant corruption, uncontrolled crime and pitiable health services. This ‘captain’s team’ has also won a trophy when the ‘gold smuggling allegations’ landed at the doorsteps of CM’s office. It is time to judge the last five years,” he said. Surjewala alleged that the government is waiting to proceed with the EMCC deep sea fishing deal after the election. Displaying the photos of the website of Kerala State Inland Navigation Corporation (KSINC), he said the web links of the MoU are still active but there were no documents of MoU cancellation available though the government said they cancelled it. “Under the watch of the LDF government, KSINC committed the unpardonable sin of selling livelihood of Kerala’s fishermen to an American company,” he said. Citing the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) 2020, he alleged that Kerala had the highest youth unemployment rate in the country, shooting up to 40.5% in January-March 2020 from 36.3% in October-December, 2019. During January-March 2020, the unemployment rate for women was 48.3%, again the highest in India, he said. “According to the live register of employment exchanges in Kerala, as of July 31, 2020, there were 34.3 lakh youth job seekers in the state. But the government is more focused on giving jobs to LDF sympathisers through backdoor appointments,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ldf-means-lies-deception-fraud/articleshow/81694583.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

That emotion persists in everyone. Everybody knows what kind of wantonness the state government had indulged in, using the Supreme Court order on the Sabarimala issue as a pretext. Those who have indulged in such wanton actions will have to be definitely dealt with sternly,’’ Gopi told reporters after offering prayers at Vadakkunnathan Temple here. “That emotion is prevailing not just among the Hindus, but among many others, cutting across religious borders. Different Christian communities had expressed similar fears later,’’ he added. Replying to questions, he said he was not making any claims on the possibilities of a victory in Thrissur. “Let people give me a victory. Last time I had said I’m taking over Thrissur, but this time people are saying they are offering me Thrissur,’’ Gopi said. Later, a roadshow was conducted in the city as part of his campaign. The roadshow started after the actor garlanding the statue of Shakthan Thampuran.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/suresh-gopi-enters-campaign-front/articleshow/81694614.cms||---

Most of these are eateries. The development is in contrast to the period of the lockdown between April and July 2020. During that time, 13 of the 17 outlets then operational had shut down after suffering huge losses. With the Metro recording steady rise in passenger footfall over the past seven months, local business on premises of station have also picked up. As of now, there are 24 outlets on 22 stations of Lucknow Metro. These include restaurants, bakeries, cafes, ice cream parlours, lounge and automobile stores. According to official sources, to promote local business, the UP Metro Rail Corporation (UPMRC) has provided relaxations too. “We are now asking for security money deposit in easy monthly instalments. We are also making effort to increase passenger footfall so that commuters can further engage in these outlets,” said the source. Lucknow Metro gets close to 42,000 footfall per day against 70,000 before the pandemic struck. Speaking to TOI, Nikita Mehrotra, the manager of a restaurant chain, said, “After lockdown, local businesses have steadily revived. Before Covid, we had one restaurant at Bhootnath Metro station and now have opened another one at Alambagh Metro station. Soon, we will open one each at Lucknow University and Krishnanagar Metro stations.” She added that the Metro corporation had helped local businesses to revive by promoting them. Space to an outlet at a Metro station is given on lease for nine years, which can be extended for another six years. UPMRC earns around Rs 9 crore yearly from such revenue centres, while it earns Rs 150 crore yearly from sale of tickets. “As the majority of passengers are students and daily office-goers who need quick food, most outlets are those of eateries,” said a source in UPMRC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/outlets-at-metro-stations-picking-up-speed-again/articleshow/81696279.cms||Arvind Chauhan

This is the second time Deshpande has rescued a woman threatening suicide in his decade-long career.On March 20, Deshpande was patrolling when the control room informed of a distress call from Malad’s Chincholi area. A 32-year-old homemaker had climbed the overhead water tank of a four-storey building with the intention of leaping off after a heated argument with her husband.“I was connected to her husband over phone and he sounded very anxious. He had followed her to the terrace and was pleading with her to step down,” said Deshpande. The police vehicle reached the society at 4.05pm, within minutes of the call. Spotting the vehicle, the woman was further enraged. “Her husband told us she was furious that he had dialled the cops and threatened to kill herself right away. He forbade me from coming upstairs and requested that the fire brigade be summoned. But I promised I would save her. My only advice to him was to keep his wife busy in conversation while not disconnecting his call to me,” said Deshpande.The constable ran up the four floors only to realise he was on the wrong terrace. “I ran down and climbed the correct wing,” said Deshpande. He slipped on to the terrace unseen and hid under the water tank briefly. While she was distracted talking to her husband and went to look down at the ground, the cop climbed up the tank and pulled her back. With her husband’s help, he brought her down to safety. A labourer working in a school nearby filmed the incident. The video clip was tweeted by home minister Anil Deshmukh, lauding Deshpande.In April last year, Deshpande, who lives in south Mumbai, was going to work on his motorcycle when he spotted a woman hanging from a speed sign on the JJ flyover. He halted and tried to convince her to come down but she paid no heed and instead hurled expletives at him. Deshpande dialled the control room for help while waiting with her. Police vehicles arrived and she was brought down. The woman had been depressed with domestic issues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/cop-rescues-homemaker-threatening-to-jump-off-bldg/articleshow/81695857.cms||Nitasha Natu
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Singh asks HC for ‘safe custody’ of CCTVs at Deshmukh’s home||MUMBAI: Former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh on Friday filed a public interest litigation before the Bombay high court seeking directions for the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to conduct an “immediate unbiased, uninfluenced, impartial and fair investigation in the various corrupt malpractices” of Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh, as alleged by him on March 20 in an 8-page letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. Deshmukh has denied all the allegations in the letter. Singh’s petition also sought directions for taking into “safe custody” CCTV footage at Deshmukh’s residence and for orders to the state government to ensure that police transfers are “neither done for any consideration of pecuniary benefit to any politician nor in contravention of directions of the Supreme Court.” He also sought urgent directions to produce the complete file of the report submitted by Rashmi Shukla as commissioner (intelligence), state intelligence department, for perusal of the HC. Shukla’s report, submitted to the state government in August 2020, was about the police transfers racket. Singh’s PIL is likely to be mentioned soon for fixing of a date. It is Singh versus the State, Centre, CBI and Anil Deshmukh in the criminal PIL. He stated that he apprehends that unless urgent directions are issued, evidence in the form of CCTV footage at Deshmukh’s residence may be destroyed. Singh cited the SC order which asked him why he had not approached the HC, which has the authority to address his concerns. The SC bench, in its order on Wednesday granting him liberty to move the HC, had said, “We have no doubt that the matter is quite serious and affects the administration at large. It also appears that a lot of material which has come in public domain is a consequence of the personas falling out.” Singh’s PIL stated he had learnt last August that Shukla had highlighted the alleged corruption by the home minister and in February end this year, Deshmukh held meetings with Sachin Waze of the crime intelligence unit and told Waze “that he had a target to accumulate Rs 100 crore a month.” Singh said he was “shocked to know” from Waze and another officer about the “demand” and that in mid-March, he had even pointed out to the CM about the alleged malpractices. He said on March 17, the state home department issued an order transferring him from his post as Mumbai police chief to the home guards department in an “arbitrary and illegal manner without completion of the minimum fixed tenure of two years, on the pretext of administrative exigencies.” The PIL also said that in the MP Mohan Delkar suicide case, “though nothing relating to abetment of suicide was found to have happened in Mumbai,” the Maharashtra home minister had desired a case to be registered in Mumbai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-singh-asks-hc-for-safe-custody-of-cctvs-at-deshmukhs-home/articleshow/81695512.cms||---
---||Mumbai||In kids’ interest to stay in India, HC tells US mother||Mumbai: Observing that the best interest of the child is paramount in a matrimonial dispute, the Bombay high court dismissed a US-based woman’s petition against her husband staying in Mumbai with their two children after having brought them to India for a two-week holiday in August 2018. The estranged couple, who had married in Gujarat in 2001 under the Parsi Zoroastrian rights, has divorce and custody litigation pending in the US and India. The man filed for divorce under the Parsi matrimonial court in 2018. The court, however, allowed the woman access to the children, now 17 and 15, through video every weekend. It clarified its ruling will have no bearing on the divorce and custodyproceedings. A US court had granted shared custody in November 2018 and in August next year rejected the husband’s objection to its jurisdiction. A court in India had in April 2018 restrained the wife from proceeding with her divorce plea before the US court. A bench of Justices S S Shinde and Manish Pitale said the husband’s objection might have been rejected by a US court, but the Bombay HC “cannot ignore” what would be in the “best interest of the children” and has a duty as parens patriae (legal protector of citizens unable to protect themselves). “In such acrimonious matrimonial disputes, it is found that the children are victims of circumstances,” said the HC. “It is significant that when the children can be said to have developed roots in the country where they have been brought, it becomes a relevant factor for determining what would be in their interest,” said the HC. When the children are close to turning adults, their desire on where they wish to stay is relevant too, the court added, after hearing submissions by Amir Arsiwala for the woman and Anoshak Daver with Mac Bodhanwalla for the man. The woman had filed a habeas corpus petition to produce her children. She claimed her husband had defied the shared custody consent order of the US court and, hence, they should return to the US to participate in pending proceedings there. The fact that the petitioner was the mother “cannot alone be a factor for passing an order in her favour”, said the court, adding that it was not persuaded to hold that the children were in “illegal custody” of their father. The judges, after interacting with both children, said they were “emphatic that they desired to live with their father”. “The desire of the daughters to continue to live with their father in India cannot be completely ignored when this court is called upon to decide as to what would be in their best interest,’’ said the HC, but granted the mother “access through video conferencing” to the children every Saturday and Sunday for an hour each. The HC said the couple “may mutually agree on further details of such visitation rights…including during school holidays”. If she visits India, the estranged husband shall arrange for her stay for two weeks and allow her to meet the children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/in-kids-interest-to-stay-in-india-hc-tells-us-mother/articleshow/81695925.cms||Swati Deshpande

---||Lucknow||Six months on, Lucknow University yet to fill 180 teaching vacancies||LUCKNOW: Interviews for 180 vacant posts of teachers in Lucknow University have not started even six months after issuing of advertisement and submission of application forms by the candidates. Besides leaving candidates frustrated, the delay may also impact LU’s score in re-evaluation by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) and the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF). LU has 516 permanent teaching posts. Of these, 180 posts in various departments have been vacant for the past many years. Twice in the past, efforts were made to fill the vacancies but the process could not be completed owing to legal issues. As a result, LU authorities skipped NAAC re-evaluation and NIRF assessment as they were apprehensive that faculty shortage will bring poor grades. The previous NAAC evaluation of LU expired in May 2019. In this academic year, which is also the university’s centenary year, LU decided to fill all the vacancies and get NAAC and NIRF assessment done. If all vacancies are filled, teachers are confident that LU will get a good ranking in both the evaluation processes, which, in turn, will elevate its status in the country. The advertisements for 180 vacant permanent posts were issued in September last year and applications were submitted by October 19. Simultaneously, LU also started the process to appoint faculty on contract basis on 185 vacant out of 285 adhoc posts. The interviews for the adhoc posts will be held by Match-end while those for permanent vacancies are yet to begin. “We paid Rs 1,500 as fees with the application for a post. The high court recently stayed the appointment process on a post in the anthropology department, but allowed LU to go ahead with recruitment in other departments. I don’t know why LU has slowed down the entire process,” said a candidate. “If LU expedites the process it will also benefit the students and contribute to its overall development too. In the previous NAAC evaluation, LU got ‘B’ grade and lost maximum marks in the student-teacher ratio because of huge vacancies,” said an LU professor. Vice-chancellor Prof Alok Kumar Rai said the interviews for appointments will begin soon. Officials said that screening of 70% of the applicants for the permanent posts has been completed and the remaining will be done soon and interviews will begin in April.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/six-months-on-lu-yet-to-fill-180-teaching-vacancies/articleshow/81696299.cms||Mohita Tewari

Speaking at a meet-the-press programme in Thiruvananthapuram on Thursday, Raja said that the LDF would hold talks with all stakeholders once the Supreme Court pronounces its verdict on entry of women of all ages to Sabarimala. On the remarks by CPI state secretary Kanam Rajendran that the statement filed by the state government before the Apex Court will stand, Raja said it was just one aspect of the issue and main thing was that a stand could be taken only after the court issues a verdict on Sabarimala. He said that the Union home minister Amit Shah’s stand on Sabarimala issue was against the law of the land. “BJP should not be allowed to get a foothold in Kerala,” Raja said. To a query whether CPI is in dilemma over the left front forming an alliance with Congress in other states and confronting that party in Kerala, Raja said there is no confusion in the party regarding the issue. “At the national level, we are trying to stop the advancement of BJP. In Kerala, we take on Congress,” Raja said. He said that the election commission of India (ECI) and Union ministry of law and justice should clarify on why the Rajya Sabha election to fill the seats from Kerala was frozen. Byelections to Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh were held. On women reservation, he said that women need more representation in legislative bodies. Rajya Sabha had passed a bill on 33% women reservation in Parliament and legislative assemblies. But the bill is yet to be cleared by the Lok Sabha, Raja said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/teach-defence-tricks-to-own-partymen-raja-tells-rahul/articleshow/81694628.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Delay in setting of sea breeze is causing spike in temperatures for the city.” System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research said Mumbai’s overall air quality index for PM 2.5 on Thursday was 283 — up from 239 a day earlier.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-as-temp-rises-met-predicts-heat-wave-in-parts-of-city/articleshow/81695537.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Hyderabad||HC rejects govt report on waqf assets, wants action on squatters||Hyderabad: The Telangana high court on Thursday rejected a report of the minority welfare department on waqf properties and wondered if the state government and TSWB will ever be able to reclaim waqf properties from encroachers. “We are interested in the extent of resumption. Not in the juggling of facts. Neither the report says anything about the status of the proposed constitution of the special task force for reclaiming the lost properties. Nor was the state counsel informed enough to brief us on the current status,” a bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy said. The bench directed the principal secretary of minority welfare to file a fresh report by including details of the task force and action taken in the last three months along with particulars of resumption — district wise — within two weeks. The bench was hearing a batch of petitions filed by Abid Rasool Khan, former chairman of the Telangana State Minorities Commission, and others who want the TSWB to reclaim all the waqf properties, particularly burial grounds, and to ensure that no discrimination was shown towards the burial of those who had died of Covid-19. After Harender Pershad, state’s special counsel, furnished the report filed by the principal secretary, the bench went through it and expressed its despair over the state of affairs. The special counsel explained that the government had issued eviction notices to 2,186 squatters under section 54(3) of the Waqf Act. “But, there is nothing in this report to show whether such notices resulted in the resumption of any piece of land,” the bench said. The bench had earlier sought a report from the principal secretary on the status of the waqf properties, including burial grounds, encroachments and also steps taken to resume them from encroachers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-rejects-govt-report-on-waqf-assets-wants-action-on-squatters/articleshow/81696313.cms||---

Before the glitz and glamour of the Indian Premier League (IPL), Sheesh Mahal Tournament used to attract top players like Bishan Singh Bedi, Kapil Dev, Virendra Sehwag and MS Dhoni. “Plans are afoot to restart the famous tournament. We have already discussed the nitty-gritty with all stakeholders,” former Ranji player and UP minister for minority affairs Mohsin Raza said on Thursday. “We intend to relaunch the tournament in June once IPL is over. The tournament will be in T20 format and organised on league-cum-knockout basis,” Raza said. He, however, added that the plans were tentative and the situation of coronavirus pandemic would be taken into account before rolling out the final plan. “Through this tournament, we will provide a good platform to young players to showcase their talent,” Raza said. The tournament was started in 1951 by cricket enthusiast M Askari Hasan to satiate the urge of fans who were usually devoid of the sport during the summer sesaon. After 59 years of glory, the tournament was discontinued in 2010 when IPL took the centre stage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sheesh-mahal-all-set-for-relaunchin-a-new-avatar/articleshow/81696311.cms||---
---||Surat||Four cops suspended, eight arrested in Surat, Tapi||Surat: Eight people including a local BJP leader were arrested while four policemen suspended as videos of crowded pre-wedding celebrations in Surat and Tapi districts went viral on social media Two policemen were suspended and four persons arrested after a video of a massive crowd dancing at a pre-wedding party in Verakui village of Surat district went viral on social media on Wednesday night. Mangrol police arrested four persons including a local BJP leader, the father of the bride, for flouting the Covid-19 rules amid a major surge in infections. Rural areas of Surat are reporting close to 100 cases daily for the past several days. Head constable Hemant Bawabhai and constable Suhas Shripad were suspended by Surat district superintendent of police (DSP) Usha Rada. On Thursday, police arrested Idrish Malek, Maqsood Malek, Haresh Gamit and Girish Vasava and they were released on bail later. They were booked under Indian Penal Code (IPC) including 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread the infection of any disease dangerous to life) and 270 (malignant act likely to spread the infection of any disease dangerous to life). The accused were booked under sections of the Gujarat Police Act and The Disaster Management Act. In the videos, villagers are seen in large numbers dancing and playing garba to the tune of DJ music. While social distancing was obviously absent, the majority of the participants had not even worn masks. “Usually, Muslims don’t organize musical parties in marriage functions, but it was the wish of my villagers. Hence, I invited all. It was a small function,” Idrish Malek told TOI.  A similar incident was reported in Velda village of Tapi district’s Nizar taluka and the video of a pre-wedding revelry went viral. Covid-19 rules went for a complete toss as a huge crowd danced to DJ tunes. Investigation revealed that the video was of Tuesday’s event organized by Joga Padvi, a peon in a local school, for his daughter’s wedding. Police registered an office and arrested Padvi, Dilip Kotwadiya and Ashish Vasava, operators of a music band. Two cops of Nizar police station - sub-inspector ZN Bhoye and head constable Ganpatsinh Bariya were suspended by Tapi DSP Sujata Majmudar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/four-cops-suspended-eight-arrested-in-surat-tapi/articleshow/81694646.cms||---
---||Goa||Had favoured municipal polls on party lines: Cabral||Margao: Power minister Nilesh Cabral on Thursday said that holding the civic polls on party lines would have helped the government in assessing its strength as the state gears up for assembly elections early next year. Speaking to TOI, Cabral said he had been a strong votary of civic elections to be held on party lines and that he had even put forth this view before the party leaders. The Curchorem MLA suffered a setback after several candidates from his camp were defeated by independent candidates at the recently concluded elections for the Curchorem Cacora Municipal Council (CCMC). “Had the elections been held on party lines, it would have helped the respective MLAs in assessing the measure of their popularity,” Cabral reasoned. “Even if there were to be rebellion by some candidates, they could have been later persuaded to join hands with the council in the interest of the development of the city, the way independents and other outfits supported the BJP government after the 2017 polls.” The decision of the government not to hold the civic polls on party lines had come as a surprise as the BJP had swept the zilla panchayat elections that were held only a few months back. Cabral, however, dismissed any suggestion that the outcome of the CCMC polls was a reflection of any anti-incumbency sentiment building against him ahead of the 2022 assembly polls. In the recently concluded polls, several of the candidates backed by Cabral were defeated by independents and, in some wards, by rebel BJP karyakartas. Nevertheless, Cabral claimed to have won 11 of the 15 seats. Political observers said that the BJP had it relatively easy this time as the opposition parties had failed to put up candidates in the civic polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/had-favoured-municipal-polls-on-party-lines-cabral/articleshow/81696321.cms||---

The panel won four seats out of the 26 it contested, but said that the panel is not limited to the polls and is looking at more young people to join it to work towards the betterment of the city. “We will try to work for the city in whatever best way we can by suggesting measures to the council. The elections may be over, but our role as conscientious citizens can never be over if we want to develop our city,” co-convener of the panel Sandeep Heble said. The panel he said will not act like a shadow council, but will try to help by involving more youth and volunteers from a cross section of society. “We lost 10 seats with less than a 50-vote margin. It was close despite delimitation where all the wards were broken up. It was a struggle for a new group like us. Despite all hurdles, we managed to put up a good fight and win four wards,” he said. Heble said that they formed the group to take on the power and might of the ruling establishment as there was absolutely no opposition. “If we find that things are not going well we will take up issues and keep a watch and check on the corporation. We are not against anybody. We accept the people’s mandate, but we cannot allow anything and everything to happen just because they’ve won a majority. We will give positive suggestions.” He said the panel’s manifesto was a seven to eight page document, which was not released in toto. This included restoration of the Rua de Ourem creek, St Inez creek, a bus transit system, free parking for CCP voters and reduction in house tax. “We will form a committee and try to interact with CCP and push them to implement what’s right for Panaji. Our agenda is not personal, it’s for Panaji city,” Heble said.

Meanwhile, the department has started inviting applications for admissions from international students for the academic year 2021-22. The university attracts thousands of foreign students every year. “We are admitting international students. The entire process is online and streamlined. After checking their examination score and other eligibility criteria the students are offered provisional admissions. After this, they can attend classes and appear for examinations. We will confirm the admissions after these students come to the country and submit their documents. We would then scrutinise these documents and charge the tuition fee,” Vijay Khare, director of the Centre for International Affairs, said. The university said it has admitted 500 plus students in the academic year 2020-21 in non-professional courses, despite the threat of Covid 19 and restrictions on international travel. “We are hoping for a better performance this year. We are in constant touch with these students and every college too has been told to respond to queries from the students,” he said. Students can fill up online application forms from March 22 to June 3. As of now, the university has told students to submit hard copies of their application form and supporting documents between June 22 and July 31. The university has at present students from 69 countries studying in its various affiliated colleges with a maximum number of students from middle-eastern countries and Africa. “We miss the diverse perspective and cultural flavour they brought to the university. We used to have food festivals where cuisines from different countries were showcased, then we had sports and other cultural festivals. We are missing all of that in the online teaching,” Khare added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/no-fees-for-foreign-pupils-at-sppu-till-offline-classes/articleshow/81694698.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Hyderabad||NASA, University of Hyderabad find bacteria that can help grow plants in space||HYDERABAD: Researchers from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and University of Hyderabad (UoH) have jointly discovered a novel species of bacteria from the International Space Station (ISS) that could help in space agriculture to meet the long-term food needs of astronauts and space tourists to the moon or Mars. The new bacterial species, Methylobacterium ajmalii, has been found to bust stress that plants undergo in zero gravity in space. Plants, which grow on their own on Earth, need the support of bacteria to provide essential nutrients to grow in space. The new bacteria contains genes that fix nitrogen, dissolve phosphate and assimilate potassium — three nutrients important for plants to grow both on earth and space. The novel species has been named after eminent biodiversity scientist Dr Seyed Ajmal Khan. The genes present in the bacteria are also helpful in growth promotion and fighting plant diseases, besides promoting protein and pigment metabolism. According to the HCU-NASA scientists, the bacteria they have discovered would provide the much-needed fuel to plants to thrive in harsh space conditions. Once successful in their bacterial mission, space tourists and astronauts need not depend on canned foods alone. They could then grow their own food in space stations. This space farming will help those on long missions to consume freshly grown fruits and vegetables, instead of depending on processed foods. Along with Methylobacterium ajmalii, the researchers also discovered three more species of bacteria, including one identified as Methylorubrum rhodesianum. The other two were identified as belonging to Methylobacterium indicum. These bacterial species were isolated from different locations from the ISS during two successive missions. The researchers said the bacteria contain “biotechnologically useful genetic determinants that may help growing plants in extreme places where resources are minimal”. Further experimental validations are being done to prove that it could, indeed, be a potential game-changer for space agriculture. According to UoH statement here on Thursday, the research teams were led by Dr Kasturi Venkateswaran (Jet Propulsion Laboratory of NASA), CC Wang (World Quant Initiative for Quantitative Prediction), Prof Appa Rao Podile from the UoH and Dr Ramprasad (CSIR-pool scientist).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/nasa-uoh-find-bacteria-that-can-help-grow-plants-in-space/articleshow/81696323.cms||Syed Akbar

Police named the campaign as ‘Dand Nahi Pan Mask Lagao.’ “Mask is the most important defence against this infection. If people start using masks, police will have no scope to collect fines,” Tomar added. “We don’t want public-police’s relationship to be defined by fine.

The results were announced by National Testing Agency (NTA) on Wednesday night. However, none from Pune managed a 100 percentile even though there were 13 from the country in the list.Two students from Bakliwal Tutorials, Naman Agarwal (99.997) and Jainesh Mehta (99.993) scored the maximum in the March cycle. Six other students from Bakliwal Tutorials have scored a perfect 100 percentile in one of the three subjects. Director of Bakliwal Tutorials, Vaibhav Bakliwal, said, “According to our analysis, after two phases of JEE Main, students with 99.9+ percentile shall roughly correspond to an All-India Rank (AIR) within 900. Overall, more than 407 students from our class have scored above 90 percentile which was last year’s tentative cut-off for the general category.”NTA reopened the registration window on Thursday for correction and registration for the subsequent cycles of April and May, and the window is likely to remain open for a week. The final merit list will be announced by the NTA after February, March, April, and May sessions of JEE (Main) 2021 exam, and the ranks of the candidates will be released taking into consideration the best of the four NTA scores. This is for the first time the JEE (Main) is being offered four times a year and in 13 languages.From IITian’s Prashikshan Kendra, Priyanka Date, scored 99.900 percentile, the maximum in the institute and 33 students scored above 99 percentile.Director Durgesh Mangeshkar said, “The differences in the difficulty level of the question papers in the March exam slots was more pronounced than in the February exam. So, many students have got lesser percentiles in March exam despite increase in their marks. This, however, does not render the normalisation process invalid since the base used to calculate percentile in February and March exams remains same at almost one lakh students per exam slot.”From Allen Pune, Shreyas Grampurohit, topped the institute with 99.88 percentile. Arun Jain, centre head, said that, “Since the rank will be declared taking the best of the four attempts into consideration, students who might have scored high percentile in either of the first two attempts, may still face competition from students scoring high in any of the upcoming two attempts, hence students are also advised to take up the next two attempts or at least one of them, which also has the possibility of witnessing lesser students due to board exams and thus it should give them an opportunity to score high within a possibly smaller pool.”From Prime Academy, 120 students appeared for JEE Main, and 92 have crossed the 90 percentile mark and 12 got 99 percentile, founder director, Lalit Kumar said. “We are advising students to appear for the remaining two phases also to get even more accustomed with the exam conditions. This experience will be very helpful for JEE Advanced,”he added.Gargi Bakshi (18) moved to Mumbai from Nashik two years ago for better coaching. Her decision to move cities paid off as she emerged as one of the toppers in the second phase of JEE (Main).Vashi’s Atharva Tambat (18) too bagged the perfect 100 in the second phase. Both students attempted the test for the second time, after falling short of their desired score in the first attempt in February. Bakshi and Tambat are among the 13 students in the country to score 100 percentile in the March exam.Tambat, a student of Ryan International School in Sanpada, scored 99.97 percentile in February.Bakshi is keen on pursuing computer science from IIT-Bombay and is now focused on the preparation for JEE (Advanced).(With inputs from Yogita Rao)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/99-percentile-in-jee-raises-higher-air-hopes-for-many/articleshow/81694691.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

Married at the age of 14-years in Silaari village in Jodhpur district, Chhota fought with her family and community to get her marriage annulled by the family court, the decision of which came on March 19, 2021. Daughter of a poor farmer family, she was married off on the occasion of Akha Teej along with her four sisters. “I wasn’t told until the very day of marriage. My two elder sister and two cousins, one of whom was also under-age, were married off together. As two brides were under-age, no invitation cards were published, ceremony took place in night, ” recalled Chhota. She continued with her studies while her husband, then 21-years-old, kept pestering her to come to her in-law’s home by doing a ceremony of ‘Gauna’. He would come to her school, humiliating her publicly and asked her to stop her education. One day her husband along with his brother came to her house and forcefully took her with them. In the middle of the road, he stopped the bike and tried to molest her. Chhota said, “He tore my clothes in the middle of the road, but his brother saved me. After reaching his house, I called up my brother who took me away. I begged my family, but they didn’t help me further as the caste panchayat had threatened them of outcasting them. With no option, I decided to run away from my village and came to Jodhpur.” A generous woman in Jodhpur allowed Chhota to stay in her hostel for free while she worked at a ticket counter at a cinema hall. Chhota contacted many NGOs in ,Jodhpur but no one helped her until she found a lawyer who agreed to take up her case without fees. Lawyer Rajendra Soni in Jodhpur said courage and strong will power of Chhota made it possible to win the case. “During the hearing in family court, the lawyer of the opponent party tried to confuse and break her emotionally, but this girl stood her ground. She was in depression due constant harassing calls from her husband and even attempted suicide. But somehow, we counselled her to stay strong. Finally, the marriage is annulled and she is free,” said Soni. Chhota Choudharyis now preparing for competitive examination of constable and will resume her graduation from this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/how-this-jodhpur-child-bride-fought-her-way-to-annul-marriage-in-court/articleshow/81695581.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Debt-hit farmer, wife and two kids end lives||HYDERABAD: Hit by mounting debt and crop loss, a farmer and three members of his family killed themselves in Telangana’s Mancherial district late on Wednesday. In a suicide pact, J Ramesh (50), a cotton farmer from Malkapalli village in Kasipet mandal, his wife Padma (45), newly married daughter Soumya (19) and son Akshay (17), a student, killed themselves. At least 100 farmers have killed themselves in Telangana over the past year, many due to crop loss and debts, according farmers’ outfits. On Thursday morning, a relative grew suspicious as she did not see the family outside the house. She forced open the main door and found the couple hanging from the ceiling rods. Soumya and Akshay’s lifeless bodies were lying dead in the bed. “Akshay and Ramesh ended their lives in one room, while Padma and Soumya hanged themselves in the adjacent room. After the children committed suicide, the couple pulled their bodies down and then ended their lives,” Devapur sub-inspector Vijayender said. Preliminary investigations by Kasipet police revealed that as a tenant farmer Ramesh cultivated cotton and tomatoes in 30 acres in Malkapalli village. “In the suicide note, he said he had borrowed money for farming expenses and also for his daughter’s marriage performed last year. But he incurred losses in cotton farming and was unable to clear the debt of Rs 16 lakh,” Vijayender said. A suicide note purportedly written by Ramesh and signed by all four members was found in the house. “The note was written in Telugu and in it Ramesh asked his brothers to forgive him and his wife,” the SI said. “Even if I had Rs 10 lakh or even Rs 7-8 lakh, four lives would have been saved. I do not have a single acre. I made Rs 3 lakh by selling cotton and had to use it for clearing debts. I told everyone that money will be repaid by March 25, but I am unable to do it,” the note said, adding, “If I alone end my life, those who gave money will ask my family members to return it. They said they can't live without me and we decided to end our lives.” Their bodies were shifted to Mancherial government hospital for post-mortem examination and a case was registered under section 174 of CrPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/debt-hit-farmer-wife-two-kids-end-lives/articleshow/81696334.cms||Mahesh Buddi

The boat, Ravihansi with 300kg of heroin worth crores in the international market and five AK-47 rifles along with 1,000 live rounds was intercepted on March 18 and has been taken to Vizhinjam on Thursday. The Coast Guard ships and aircraft have been conducting extensive search in the area of Lakshadweep Islands. On March 18, patrolling Coast Guard units detected three suspicious boats off Minicoy Islands and intercepted them. Upon interrogation, the crew gave inconsistent statements. On rummaging the boats, the weapons and drugs were recovered from one of the boats. The value of the drugs has been roughly estimated at Rs 3,000 crore in the international market. All the three boats along with 19 crew have been taken to Vizhinjam for further joint investigation. This is the second major anti-drug trafficking operation undertaken by the Coast Guard on western coast within a fortnight. On March 5, the Coast Guard ships and aircraft, in a coordinated operation in Lakshadweep seas, had successfully apprehended Sri Lankan boat Akarsha Duwa with six crew off Minicoy Island. The crew had admitted to carrying 200kg high grade heroin and 60kg hashish which was jettisoned in the sea on sighting the Coast Guard ships on patrol. In a similar operation in November last year, Coast Guard had apprehended another Sri Lankan boat Shenaya Duwa off Kanyakumari, carrying 120kg narcotic drugs worth Rs 1,000 crore and five weapons. The past one year has proved to be a big setback for drug traffickers at sea as the Coast Guard has successfully seized about 1.6 tonnes of narcotics worth approximately Rs 4,900 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/drugs-worth-rs-3k-cr-5-ak-47-rifles-seized-from-sl-boat/articleshow/81694708.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Marginal dip in vaccine wastage, from 8.5% to 7% in a week in UP||Lucknow: In less than a week, UP has brought down the vaccine wastage from 8.5% to 7% according to data from the state health department. The government has directed districts registering higher wastage to ensure the proportion of wastage has to be brought below the national average of 6.5%. In Covid-19 review undertaken with the states last week, wastage had been discussed in detail and the PM had called upon the states to strive for zero wastage. In response, UP reviewed the situation and instructed the districts. “The CM directed officials to ensure that wastage is brought below the national average soon and steps must be taken to achieve the goal of zero wastage. Accordingly instructions were issued to the districts,” said a health department officer. The maximum permissible wastage limit in India is 10%. Internal assessment of health department revealed that while actual wastage – which means opening a vial and not using it completely -- was negligible. But spoilage due to factors like over cooling or breakage while opening the vial were reported in two dozen districts. Officials in the errant districts have been told to plan better and control the wastage,” officials stated. Experts feel better planning in terms of slot allocation, undertaking social mobilisation as per consumption pattern can be done to minimise the wastage. “Slot allocation – which is about giving an appointment to the persons who comes for the vaccination – must be planned well as each vial has to be used within four hours of opening it,” said Dr Praful Bharadwaj, heath officer Unicef, which is helping the state implement and monitor vaccine drive. Stating that optimisation of available stock is very important as even a small reduction in wastage would mean several lakhs getting the shot, social scientist Dr Vishwajeet Kumar said: “The present system has a health department representative till the level of village. Getting a list of willing persons made is not a tough task. Government must leverage this network to boost vaccination in rural areas.” WHO NPSP regional team leader, UP field office, Dr Madhup Bajpai said: “Wastage means that somewhere planning has failed to deliver expected outcome. Therefore, fine tuning the micro plan, flagging sites with high wastage and periodic review are some steps that may be taken.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/marginal-dip-in-vaccine-wastage-from-8-5-to-7-in-a-week-in-up/articleshow/81696333.cms||Shailvee Sharda

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Rly panel to suggest part-AC rake ideas for general coaches||MUMBAI: The railway board has formed a six-member committee to recommend the most ideal combinations for partial AC rakes which will also include general class compartments. Currently, a 12-car AC rake has two sets of six coaches with no general or first class. “The committee is deliberating on the issue and will soon come out with its recommendations,” Alok Kansal, general manager, Western Railway, told TOI on Thursday. The committee comprises the chief electrical engineer of WR and Central Railway, the chief commercial manager (passenger marketing) of CR, the chief passenger traffic manager of WR, the chief design engineer of Integral Coach Factory (ICF) and a Mumbai Railway Vikas Corporation official. WR began to run AC locals from December 25, 2017, between Churchgate and Virar. Before the Covid-19 lockdown, around 20,000 passengers used 12 services per day. Even though it has a fleet of six AC rakes, it runs only 12 services with two rakes as replacing the existing non-AC trains will lead to anger among general class passengers. Kansal said, “Partial AC locals will not have first-class compartments. First-class passengers may have to upgrade their first-class season tickets to AC class.” A WR official said, “We are of the view that semi-AC locals can be run in a combination of 9 non-AC plus 3 AC (12 cars) and 9 non-AC plus 6 AC (15 cars).” WR plans to run 15-car AC locals on the slow corridor too, once work on platform extension between Andheri-Virar is completed by March 31. Some railway officials said introduction of semi-AC locals will lead to loss of punctuality. A senior railway official said, “A non-AC local has a wait time of around 15 to 20 seconds. But for AC locals the wait time at stations could increase to 45 seconds as the train can run only after the doors are closed.” An official said, “We will have to check the technical aspect too with ICF.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rly-panel-to-suggest-part-ac-rake-ideas-for-general-coaches/articleshow/81694705.cms||Manthank Mehta

Traces of the UK variant virus have been found in 106 out of the total 116 samples in Mohali. Confirming this, civil surgeon Dr Adarshpal Kaur said, “We have found the traces of the UK variant virus in some of the samples. We do not have to do anything special as the treatment and diagnosis is the same as that of the coronavirus. The vaccination is also the same. All such patients are put under isolation similar to those infected with the Covid-19.” The traces of the UK variant virus B.1.1.7 in 80% of the samples across the Punjab state has opened the eyes of the officials of the health department and orders of extensive sampling have also been issued by the state government. Though the civil surgeon said that the virus must have been transported from the UK returnees, but it has been observed that sampling process at the Chandigarh International Airport has been minimal. The civil surgeon said, “We do carry out the sampling process every time we get a list of the UK or any other country returnees from the airport authority. We have been taking their samples because of which the traces of the virus have been detected.” According to the pan India reports, some 10,787 samples from 18 Indian states also showed up 771 cases of known variants i.e. 736 of the UK, 34 of the South African and one Brazilian. Officials say the variants are not linked to a spike in the cases in India. India reported 47,262 cases and 275 deaths on Wednesday, the highest daily rise this year. The civil surgeon said the spread of the virus is also as per the coronavirus pattern. The UK variant virus B.1.1.7 also spreads through droplets either airborne or contacts. The droplets also affect people, who are even six-feet away as it has been observed that some people have also been affected, who were ever farther than six-feet, she said. However, the civil surgeon said there is no need to panic due the new virus as it is of the similar nature that of Covid-19 and can be treated with the same vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/presence-of-uk-variant-puts-mohali-admn-on-alert-tracing-and-sampling-intensified/articleshow/81694720.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

On Tuesday (March 23), only 6,367 passengers used the airport (considering both arrivals and departures). According to the airport officials, just 2,908 passengers arrived at the airport on Tuesday, while 3,459 departed. On most of the days in March, the number of arrivals was less than the departures. For example, on March 22, there were 3,541 arrivals and 3,933 departures. On March 21, there were 5,083 arrivals against 5,170 departures. Similarly, on March 20, there were 3,379 arrivals against 3,500 departures. On March19, there were 3,325 arrivals and 3,725 departures. Before March 23, the lowest recorded passenger traffic at Pune airport was 4,242, on November 14 last year. “One must remember that on November 14 (Saturday), there were only 36 flight movements. The number of flight movements in Pune is less on the weekends. On March 23, there were 64 flight movements. Even though the drop in the number of passengers is a cause for concern, it was expected, considering the Covid surge in the state,” an airport official said. “While the difference isn’t huge, slowly but steadily, the number of people coming to Pune has been declining. The case was not the same in early March or even last month. During a large part of February too, the number of arrivals has been more than departures,” the official said. Airlines also said the load factor on their flights had become thin. “From 100% capacity, the load factor on flights on the always busy Pune-Delhi route has fallen by almost 40%,” an airline representative said.

---||Hyderabad||Khaitan booked by CBI for Rs 245 crore bank loan fraud||HYDERABAD: The Central Bureau of Investigation has booked city-based Khaitan Electricals promoters in a loan fraud case. The CBI alleged that managing director Sunil Krishna Khaitan and others colluded with various bank officials, produced fake documents to obtain Rs 245 crore loans and diverted the funds. One of the oldest companies in Hyderabad and an established name in ceiling fans market, Khaitan Electricals Ltd has a registered office in city and corporate office in Kolkata. It has manufacturing units at Balanagar and Bollaram in Hyderabad and Faridabad in Haryana. The case was filed in the principal special judge court for CBI cases in Hyderabad. The CBI Chennai unit is investigating the case. The CBI alleged that Sunil Krishna, director Sajjan Dabriwal holding the post of deputy MD, chief financial officer Swapan Kumar Das and directors — Biswajit Choudhury, Madan Gopal Todi, Ajay Kumar Kajaria, VK Rungta, Shiv Kumar Bajaj, Anjana Sharma, Gairik Banejee and Sujata Chatterjee — entered into a criminal conspiracy with the bank officials between 2011 and 2018 and cheated the banks. The CBI further alleged that the accused submitted forged documents to the banks as genuine, falsified accounts and diverted funds. The accused also inflated sales figures. Certain suspicious unsecured advances and loan sanctions were found too. Khaitan Electricals availed a number of credit facilities from State Bank of Travancore in Hyderabad from 1978. It took loans under a consortium arrangement from SBT (now merged with SBI), IDBI Bank and Allahabad Bank in Kolkata and State Bank of Patiala in Faridabad. The company also took credit facilities from Bank of India, Kolkata. “The bank officials abused their official position, allowed the accused to illegally divert the funds and misappropriate the funds of the banks,” the CBI said. Khaitan Electricals failed to repay the loans by violating the loan sanction terms because of which the accounts were later classified as NPAs in 2015. A complaint was filed by GV Sastry, deputy GM of SBI stressed assets management branch, Hyderabad, against Khaitan Electricals. A forensic audit conducted by the bank revealed the loan fraud.

Two men on a motorcycle snatched her two gold chains worth Rs90,000 and drove away. 6.15am, March 21: Duo on a motorcycle snatched a gold chain, worth Rs30,000, from a 38-year-old woman out for morning walk in Bhosari.The above three incidents are among the nine chain snatching cases lodged by the Pimpri Chinchwad police in the last 23 days. The Pimpri Chinchwad police have been closely studying chain snatching incidents that have taken place in the last three months to identify a pattern, if any, and act upon them accordingly. “I have told the unit-I of the crime branch to prepare a chart after studying the patti of these cases. The chart will include, the timing, modus, vehicles used by chain snatchers and other important details,” Pimpri Chinchwad police commissioner Krishna Prakash told TOI. He said, “This would help us in identifying the vulnerable spots, plan our bandobast, and also patrol these particular areas.” The commissioner said that the crime branch has also been told to check the chain snatcher gangs which are currently out on bail.Mask troubleKrishna Prakash said that wearing of masks is necessary due to increasing number of Covid-19 positive cases, but this also poses a problem during investigation. “It becomes difficult to recognise chain snatchers due to the masks,” he said.CCTV camerasThe commissioner said that the police have been checking CCTV camera footages to trace the trail of chain snatchers. “Currently, we only have 248 cameras. We have sent a proposal for 3,500 CCTV cameras to the state government. We have our jurisdiction outside the limits of the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation, too. We require CCTV cameras there too,” Krishna Prakash said.New gangDeputy commissioner of police (Pimpri Chinchwad) Manchak Ipper said prima facie probe revealed involvement of some new gangs in the recent chain snatching cases. “Due to the current financial situation, many people may have started committing such crimes,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pimpri-chinchwad-cops-on-hunt-to-unravel-chain-snatching-pattern/articleshow/81694731.cms||Mihir Tanksale
---||Kochi||HC: Divorced wife can’t claim right to stay in husband’s home||Kochi: A divorced wife cannot claim right of residence in the matrimonial home as a subsisting relationship is required for it, the high court has held. A division bench comprising Justice K Vinod Chandran and Justice MR Anitha gave the ruling after considering a reference made by single benches about the conflict of law between two high court decisions (Sulaiman Kunju vs Nabeesa Beevi of 2015 and Bipin vs Meera of 2016). The reference was considered in a petition by Ramachandra Warrior challenging a residence order in favour of his wife Jayasree. The conflict between the decisions was with respect to the right of a divorced woman to invoke provisions (Sections 17, 19 on right to residence) of Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 (DV Act) and whether an order of residence obtained by a wife in a shared household would seize automatically on divorce being granted subsequently. Answering the reference, the court held, “A divorced wife would not be entitled to the right of residence conferred under S.17 under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, for reason of that right being available only to a woman in a domestic relationship.” Further, the court said a divorced wife can approach the magistrate’s court for an order under Section 19 (for residence order) if she is residing in the shared household and the husband can evict her only in accordance with law. In the case of a divorced wife who is not residing in the shared household, the court said, “There can be no order to put a divorced woman in possession of a shared household, from where she had separated long back, and the relief can only be of restraining dispossession.” Shedding light on the reasoning for its ruling, the bench pointed out that the right to reside in a shared household is defined under Section 17(1) as available to “every woman in a domestic relationship”. The words ‘has been’, ‘had’, or ‘have’ not having been used in the provision, the right conferred is on a woman in a subsisting relationship, the court said. Section 17(2) and Section 19 speaks of ‘aggrieved person’, which takes in a divorced wife, and a divorced wife continuing in a shared household is entitled to seek a residence order under Section 19 and can only be evicted in accordance with law as per Section 17(2), the court said while noting that “a perceptive legislative exercise” had gone into the design of the specific provision under Section 17.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-divorced-wife-cant-claim-right-to-stay-in-husbands-home/articleshow/81694735.cms||---

They will return in September. Experts said the breeding season of migratory and resident birds have started as many winged guests have started flying back to breeding grounds while the local ones have started nesting. The cranes come soon after monsoon and generally stay in Jaisalmer, Phalodi and Ramdeora in western Rajasthan and in Gujarat’s Kutch. They fly lakhs of kilometres from cold countries and during winters.Bird expert Dwij Saini said during summer, these birds raise their chicks in Mongolia, Central Asia, southern Russia and eastern Europe. By August, these chicks grow up and prior to winter, they fly to India.Bird watcher Parth Jagani said the Centre has done many international environment and wildlife protection agreements for the security of these migratory birds.

The upgraded Army version missile has been fired from a heavy mobility truck. The new generation missile is designed for use by the Indian Air Force (IAF) and Indian Army in order to intercept high-manoeuvring aerial threats. The Indian Army artillery will become stronger from the missile. An official source said, “The surface-to-air missile was fired on Tuesday. The Akash-NG (new-generation) missile will be used by the Indian Army and Indian Air Force to intercept high-manoeuvring low radar cross-section aerial threats. The missile intercepted the target with textbook precision. The launch met all the test objectives by performing high manoeuvres during the trajectory. The missile is capable of engaging in multiple targets in real time. The missile has an intercept range of 40km with the missile guidance system being more accurate now along with the fire control system. A defence source said, “The performance of the command and control system, on-board avionics and aerodynamic configuration of the missile was successfully validated during the trial. Several range instruments including radar, EOTS and telemetry systems were used while monitoring the entire path of the missile during the test launch.” The source said that during the test launch, the entire flight path of the missile was monitored and the flight data was captured by various range instruments. The multi-function radar was tested for its capability of integration with the system. The range of the missile is from 1.8 to 2.5 Mach. The missile could be fired from tanks which are stable or even from moving surface life warships and trucks. A source said, “The Akash-NG system has been developed with better deployability compared to other similar systems. The missile is solely designed by DRDO and has been produced by defence PSU Bharat Electronics Ltd. (BEL). The test launch was carried out by a combined team of DRDO and India Army.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/upgraded-akash-missile-test-fired-in-jaisalmer-dist/articleshow/81695633.cms||---

So far in 2021, a total of 6,487 positive cases have been recorded and 76 persons have succumbed to the deadly virus. This is also being considered as single month’s highest spike in Mohali since the outbreak of the pandemic. Though the administration has taken the spike seriously and is urging people to come out in large numbers to get vaccinated, but the contact tracing and extensive sampling is another factor, which the administration is now again focusing on. Mohali deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan said, “March has been crucial and cases have been rising. The administration is doing testing so that all such positive cases are traced and treated. We also appeal the public to come out and get vaccinated which is the only remedy to defeat coronavirus.” In the 25 days of March, if 4,431 positive cases have surfaced, the active cases have also risen by 2,193. On March 1, the total positive cases were 20,375, which have now risen to reach 24,806 and the active cases were 636, which have now multiplied to 2,829.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: State Cong chief targets BJP; Supriya meets Sonia||Mumbai: State Congress president Nana Patole on Thursday criticised leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis, saying the MVA government will not hesitate to initiate a high-level probe against the BJP leader “for misleading the people of Maharashtra.” In another development, NCP Lok Sabha member Supriya Sule called on Congress president Sonia Gandhi in New Delhi. Sule’s interaction with Gandhi assumes importance in view of the political turmoil in the state in the wake of charges of corruption and extortion made against NCP leader and state home minister Anil Deshmukh. Patole said, “Fadnavis has been consistently misleading the people of Maharashtra. He is making false and baseless allegations against the government as well as a section of senior cabinet members. Even on call data records, Fadnavis gave wrong information on the floor of the house. He is misusing Central investigation agencies against the state and politicians of the ruling party,” Patole said. Patole reiterated that he has urged the state government to conduct a high-level probe against IPS officer Rashmi Shukla for her involvement in the phone-tapping episode. “We have reasons to believe she was illegally tapping phones of leading ruling party members. Apparently, she was playing into the hands of opposition members,” he alleged. Patole claimed that during the Sushant Singh Rajput death episode, the BJP had “defamed” Maharashtra, created an impression that law and order situation in the state had collapsed and was now “creating the same situation in the wake of the Sachin Waze episode.” “When Fadnavis was the CM, more than a dozen cabinet members faced serious charges of corruption, but instead of sacking them from the cabinet, he gave a clean chit to all. Even PM Modi is facing serious charges, but no one is demanding his resignation,” he said. Former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh has alleged that Deshmukh had asked encounter specialist Sachin Waze to mobilize at least Rs 100 crore per month from restaurants, bars and other establishments. Singh has written a letter to CM Uddhav Thackeray and Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari and simultaneously knocked at the doors of the courts. Singh was, in the wake of the Waze episode, transferred as DG, home guards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-cong-chief-targets-bjp-supriya-meets-sonia/articleshow/81695665.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Firetraps: 40 junior colleges told to shut||Hyderabad: Forty junior colleges in the state have been told to shut for failing to adhere to fire safety norms and for not obtaining permission from the fire safety wing. Stating this to the high court on Thursday, the Telangana State Board of Intermediate Education (TSBIE) said its officials inspected and issued closure notices to 68 junior colleges for flouting the fire safety norms. “Forty colleges, however, are non-compliant even today and we have ordered their closure,” special government pleader A Sanjeev Kumar informed a bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy. Sanjeev Kumar said no colleges were functioning in the 40 unsafe buildings. “Their managements have neither modified the college buildings nor moved out. Hence, we ensured their closure,” the state counsel said. Some of the colleges have approached the courts challenging the closure orders, he said, adding 20 colleges modified their buildings and obtained NOCs from the fire safety authority. “Some of these had moved to totally new and safe buildings. We accorded affiliation to these 20 colleges,” he said. Colleges belonging to corporate education groups like Narayana, Sri Chaitanya and Sri Gayatri too were there among the closed colleges. Some of them shifted to new premises and obtained fresh affiliations and some preferred complete closure of their branches. The HC was hearing a PIL filed by Dantham Rajesh, who charged the TSBIE with being inactive despite several private colleges running in dilapidated buildings. Rajesh said the lives of innocent students are at risk in these buildings. Upon continuous goading by the high court, the TSBIE cracked the whip and ordered the closure of colleges that are functioning in unsafe buildings. As per TSBIE’s norms, junior colleges with buildings of 15 metres or above height (G+5) must obtain an NOC from Telangana State Disaster Response and Fire Services department. College managements had been getting away by furnishing an affidavit to Intermediate board claiming they will move to a new building and obtain affiliation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/firetraps-40-junior-colleges-told-to-shut/articleshow/81696371.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Experts seek Doppler radar for Aurangabad||Aurangabad: Experts have stressed on the need to install Doppler radar for Marathwada, in view of the growing incidents of hailstorms and unseasonal rain in the recent past. In a memorandum submitted to the government, meteorologist Kirankumar Johare said the desired technology will help in an early forecast of extreme weather events so that necessary alerts can be sent to farmers and the public. “The advance information about hailstorms and unseasonal rain can minimise the agricultural damage, which has a direct impact on the local economy. Besides, extreme weather events take a toll on human lives and livestock, which is another irrevocable loss. Such collective damages can be lowered if advanced Doppler radar is in place,” he said. In the memorandum submitted to the Prime Minister’s Office, Johare sought installation of X band Doppler Radar and other weather-related facilities, which he said can predict the possible occurrences of hailstorm and rain in the range of 250 km. Besides Marathwada, Doppler radar has also been sought for north Maharashtra with Nashik being the preferred location for installation. K K Dakhore, the agricultural meteorologist with Parbhani-based Vasantrao Naik Marathwada Agriculture University, said the demand to install Doppler radar for the region was formally raised before the India Meteorological Department (IMD) in past. “The Doppler radar involves round-the-clock monitoring of weather systems using a trained workforce. The IMD is the sanctioning authority for the desired installation and should respond to the demand at the earliest,” he said. As per meteorologists, Maharashtra has the Doppler radar system at only four places - Mumbai, Mahabaleshwar in Satara district, Solapur and Nagpur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/experts-seek-doppler-radar-for-aurangabad/articleshow/81693327.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Three held for raping mentally challenged girl in Udaipur dist||UDAIPUR: Udaipur police on Thursday arrested three men for gang-rape of a mentally challenged girl in Gogunda block of the district. The crime was committed on Sunday evening, however, the girl’s parents reported the incident only on Tuesday evening. Looking at the severity of the incident, 12 teams from four police stations and the district cyber cell were constituted and thus a large force of some 200 cops, 3 DySP rank officers and an additional SP worked day and night to finally crack down on the real culprits. Laxman, 35, and Harish, 22, both residents of Netaji-ki-Bari village in Ogana and Ramesh aka Kawa Kharadi, 20, of Kanthariya village in Ogana were arrested for the crime. “We received the complaint from the survivor’s father on Tuesday. The girl had gone to graze buffalo to the fields on the Senwada road around 5.30pm. When she was returning home, the accused, who were on a motorcycle, asked her for directions. The men realized that she was mentally challenged and alone, so they planned to take advantage of her vulnerability and forcibly took her away on their bike to a deserted location on a dry nullah near Ameri. They took turns and raped her,” said Udaipur SP Rajeev Pachar. They tied her hands and legs with her clothes and when she struggled, the men hit her with sharp stones on chest, face and head. They dumped her at the spot afterwards and fled back to their homes. “The trio were labourers who had happened to meet on Sunday morning while waiting for some job at the labour stand at Syphon Circle in Udaipur. When they did not find any hirer, they went towards Gogunda, Suratgarh and after futile wandering when they were returning home, they spotted the girl walking alone,” the SP said. The matter was reported late and since the crime spot was a remote deserted location, it had no mobile connectivity. The teams held intense surveys of the surrounding area interrogating people and sought available CCTV footage from public spaces, including saloons, provision stores, taxi and bus stands, wine shops and finally got hold of Laxman Vadera, who confessed to the crime. “Rural areas have poor CCTV surveillance and feeling the need to expand its coverage in effective control over crimes, we would be taking up a campaign to cover the entire region by June end and install cameras on all the major junctions, settlements, commercial establishments and institutions. The beat constables will encourage traders, shopkeepers and common man to install maximum cameras possible around their workplaces and homes for increased security,” Pachar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/three-held-for-raping-mentally-challenged-girl-in-udaipur-dist/articleshow/81695637.cms||---

She shot herself with her service revolver. The Dharni police have recovered a suicide note from the spot, in which Deepali has accused a deputy conservator of forests (DyCF) for his high-handedness. The RFO was alone in her quarters when she ended her life. Her mother had left for Satara and husband Rajesh was in Chikhaldara, where he works on deputation with the treasury department. Talking to TOI, Amravati SP Hari Balaji confirmed, “The suicide note clearly blames the DyCF for the victim taking the extreme step by shooting herself in the chest. A case of abetment to suicide under IPC 306 is likely to be registered against the officer.” Deepali was known as ‘Melghat’s Singham’, and looking at her fighting spirit no one believed she would take such an extreme step. She was dashing and performed her duties fearlessly when it came to nabbing wildlife criminals and protection and removal of illegal encroachments, a chronic problem in MTR. She was instrumental in removing encroachments in Harisal range and earlier in Dhulghat, also in MTR. For her bold actions, she also faced atrocity cases, which are still pending in Achalpur court. Her tenure has seen several ups and downs. According to reliable sources, a day earlier, the deputy conservator had visited Harisal and scolded the RFO after he noticed some waterholes were not filled with water even as summer had set in. She seems to have decided to end her life after this. Earlier, she had written to Melghat field director seeking his intervention. However, the deputy conservator too was a disciplinarian and did not tolerate negligence from the staff. Deepali’s mother used to frequently visit her from Satara. On Thursday morning, she sent her mother back to Satara. After her mother left, she called her husband about her decision to end life, but before her husband could do something she killed herself. When some forest staff, alerted by her husband, reached her quarter, they found the RFO lying in a pool of blood and her service revolver lying beside her. Sources say after her suicide was discovered no one was allowed to enter the quarter for almost 1.5 hours. Deepali was taken to Harisal primary health centre, from where she was shifted to Dharni, but was declared ‘brought dead’ by doctors. Meanwhile, the Maharashtra Forest Rangers Association (MFRA) has demanded a thorough probe into the case, saying those responsible should be taken up sternly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/melghat-rfo-dubbed-lady-singham-shoots-self/articleshow/81695662.cms||---

The attack took place at Faizullaganj village under Pilibhit’s Madhotanda police station in an area ringed by a forest. Both boys were rushed to the community health centre. Vikas was referred to the district hospital as his condition was critical. His father, Madan Lal, said the leopard suddenly came out of the forest and pounced on the two children. Hearing their screams, people rushed to their aid. Seeing a crowd, the leopard slipped away. Naveen Khandelwal, deputy director of the Pilibhit tiger reserve, said the pugmarks, though smudged by the movement of several villagers, confirmed the presence of a leopard. Dr Sahis Ram, medical officer in-charge of emergency medical services at the community health centre, told TOI that Vikas had sustained five bone deep injuries on the neck and head, while Saurang suffered from neck injuries at four points.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/two-boys-injured-in-leopard-attack/articleshow/81692679.cms||Keshav Agarwal
---||Aurangabad||HC orders dept inquiry against cop for lapses in accident probe||Aurangabad: The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court has directed Aurangabad police commissioner to issue an appropriate charge-sheet-cum-show-cause notice and conduct a departmental inquiry against an assistant police inspector (API) for “serious failure” in properly investigating a hit-and-run accident involving a car allegedly driven by police sub-inspector (PSI) Santosh Pate. The accident that took place on April 22, 2019 near Jama Masjid on Bhadkal gate road claimed the life of 17-year-old Akefa Mehreen. In September last year, Akefa’s father, Mohammed Zaheer, had moved high court alleging a cover up and lack of action by the police despite eyewitness accounts of the accident. In December 2020, the HC had directed Aurangabad police commissioner Nikhil Gupta to look into the investigation and submit a report. In his report, Gupta cited five serious lapses on the part of API SK Khatane who investigated the accident case. This included the IO’s failure to record statements of PSI Pate, his brother Arun (in whose name the car was registered) and Shahid Khan Umar Khan, who took the injured girl to hospital. It also added failure to seek report of the doctor who performed the autopsy; failure to seek PSI Pate’s mobile tower location; failure to seek forensic expert report on contact between two vehicles due to collision and failure to prepare seizure panchnama of the car. The HC bench of justices Ravindra Ghuge and BU Debadwar on March 19 dismissed the public prosecutor’s submission that such mistakes may have occurred inadvertently. “We cannot accept such contentions for the reason that an experienced IO would never commit such acts inadvertently,” the bench said. “We wish to record that stoppage of increment for one year would be a punishment that cannot be commensurate to the gravity and the seriousness of the conduct of the IO. It would be an eye wash,” the bench said. The HC said, “If he (Khatane) is found guilty (in departmental inquiry), we would expect maximum punishment to be awarded to him since this is the only way that the faith and trust of the common man and the public at large would be reposed in the police machinery, which otherwise is facing a flak for its role in such cases.” The HC expressed its high apprecior Gupta for probing the matter “with great promptitude and by applying his investigation skills.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/hc-orders-dept-inquiry-against-cop-for-lapses-in-accident-probe/articleshow/81693337.cms||Mohammed Akhef

---||Delhi||High voltage: Overnight chase across two states, a shootout and 2 arrests||NEW DELHI: Five months after the Crime Branch booked fugitive gangster Rohit Chaudhary under MCOCA, its teams tracked him and his aide down and shot them near Pragati Maidan early on Thursday. Chaudhary and his henchman, Praveen, both sustained injuries in the thigh area and are in hospital under observation. According to Bhisham Singh, DCP (Crime), two policemen, including a woman sub-inspector, were hit on their bulletproof jackets during the exchange of fire. "Chaudhary is the kingpin of an organised gang and was among Delhi’s top 10 wanted criminals,” said Singh. “Chaudhary is a noted ‘bad character’ of Fatehpur Beri in south Delhi.” Chaudhary and Praveen, on the run for four years with Delhi and UP police offering Rs 5.75 lakh for their capture, were nabbed after a high-voltage chase across two states beginning late on Wednesday. The Crime Branch’s special task force (STF) had been on Chaudhary's trail for months. Thursday’s was the fifth raid on their hideouts since October. After receiving information about the movement of the two criminals, a team comprising ACP Pankaj Singh, SI Priyanka and others conducted a raid. However, Chaudhary managed to escape in a vehicle despite being cornered near Palwal, Haryana. While on the move, he made a video and sent to his aide on WhatsApp, police sources said. The cops eventually lost him. However, the gangster’s call to his wife got the cops back on track in the early hours. After this help from technical surveillance, the cops planned to apprehend him on Bhairon Road that he would pass on the way to National Highway 24 to reach UP. At 4.45am, a blue Glanza car approached the police barricade set up there. Moving at a high speed, the car crashed into the barricade. As the police party tried to reach the stalled vehicle and determine if it was indeed Chaudhary in it, shots rang out. ACP Singh and SI Priyanka got hit but were saved by the bulletproof jackets they were wearing. It was one of the rare instances when a policewoman had been fired upon during a face-off. The cops returned fire at the vehicle occupants and both the suspects got hit and fell down. They were overpowered by the policemen and taken to hospital in a police control room van. Two pistols and eight live cartridges were recovered from the duo. During the search of their car, several fake identities and mobile phones and dongles were recovered. The accused evidently were using fake identities to lodge in different hotels in several locations. The mobile phones and dongles were used for communicating with other gang members through internet calling applications. Delhi Police had put a price of Rs 3.5 lakh and UP police Rs50,000 on Chaudhary’s head, the two forces had offered, respectively, Rs 2 lakh and Rs 25,000 for the arrest of Praveen. TOI was the first to report on the gangster being booked under the stringent act in October last year which had led to the intensified manhunt. An FIR under Section 3 of MCOCA had been registered against Choudhary on October 9. The FIR named 13 of his associates who are at large and also detailed how he had established a criminal empire over the years. As part of proceedings under MCOCA, the Crime Branch initiated a crackdown on his syndicate and started attaching the properties amassed by Chaudhary from the proceeds of his criminal activities. This included a bulletproof Toyota Fortuner SUV. Chaudhary has dozens of cases related to murder, extortion, land grabbing and robbery lodged against him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/high-voltage-overnight-chase-across-two-states-a-shootout-and-2-arrests/articleshow/81695672.cms||---
---||Chennai||Many special children in TN find homes abroad, too few in India||Chennai: Children with special needs have not found favour with childless parents looking to adopt kids. Most children from adoption centres in Tamil Nadu have found homes abroad, but not within the country, as per data from the department of social defence. The United Nations Convention on Rights of the Child (UNCRC), which India ratified in 1992, insists on paying due regard to a child’s ethnic, religious, and cultural backgrounds while giving them for adoption. This aspect is largely achieved when it comes to finding homes for a regular child, but the ones with special needs are left with no takers as they hardly find parents willing to adopt them in the state or the country. Most of them are usually adopted by families living abroad. Data received from the department of social defence states that 35 children with special needs from the state were adopted in the last three years, and only three found homes in India. Thirty two of them were adopted by parents living in other countries such as the US and Italy. “There is medical advancement, but no social acceptance for special children,” said Maya Gaitonde, general secretary and trustee of Balamandir Kamaraj Trust, an adoption agency in Tamil Nadu. Maya explained that there are three areas of rejection which children usually face gender, colour, and disability. “We still have people who feel these kids have a disability,” she said. There are currently 39 children with special needs in the state waiting to be adopted. They have conditions such as locomotor disabilities, developmental delays, low birth weight, microcephaly. Two of them are HIV reactive, while one has ambiguous genitalia. While there are around 2,000 prospective parents waiting in line to adopt a child, a majority of them only want children with no disability, and preferably within the age of five. Dr T S Chandrasekar of MedIndia hospital said that there are several treatments, therapies and antiviral agents available to improve the conditions of special children. “All it needs is a right attitude and determination of parents... the child will drastically improve.” Dr Chandrasekar said that the government must orient prospective parents on the various treatments available. A senior official from the social defence department said that they have started linking all prospective parents to medical institutes and hospitals, where they can find the right treatment for a special child after adoption. “We want as many children to find loving homes in our own country.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/many-special-children-in-tn-find-homes-abroad-too-few-in-india/articleshow/81692070.cms||Aditi R
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Is double mutant variant serious? Only more research will tell||NAGPUR: A new ‘double mutant’ variant of Covid-19 has been detected from 206 samples collected in Maharashtra. Though district-wise details of the mutant are still not available, some districts in the state, including Nagpur, have reported a sudden spike in cases and there is a common notion that it is due to the double mutant. Doctors told TOI that only more research on the double mutant will make it clear whether it’s responsible for the present surge in cases. Epidemiologist Dr Anand Thatte said mutation is the most common characteristic of viruses. “All viruses keep changing their structures. We know it as mutation. If we consider it as a war between human antibodies and virus, they are getting new weapons. We only need to furnish our existing weapons like Covid distancing and hand hygiene,” he said. Pulmonologist Dr Ashok Arbat said vaccination needs to be promoted a lot. “Only vaccination will lead us to herd immunity. More and more people should come forward and get themselves vaccinated,” he said. According to him, the virus mutations are already active in Vidarbha. “I believe that double mutation is already active in Amravati, Yavatmal and other districts of Vidarbha and these districts have dealt with it quite effectively. This means that we can deal with the mutations,” he added. According to HIV specialist Dr Milind Bhrushundi, viruses mutate daily and there is no point in panicking before enough research. “I believe the sample size that was examined in this phase was very less as compared to the number of patients. In such a small sample size, less than 20% were found infected with new mutations. It means that 80% are still not infected with it. So in other words, we can say that more patients are safe from mutant infection,” he said, adding that time has come for scientists, doctors and epidemiologists to work together and find out a solution. World Medical Association’s rreasurer Dr Ravi Wankhedkar also targeted the small sample size. “A simple calculation shows that India registered 1,022,335 new Covid cases during December 2020 and March 2021. At least 5% of total cases are expected to be collected for sequencing. But we have done genome sequencing of just more than 10,000 samples,” he said. Doctors said most of such mutations are harmless and fail to alter the virus behaviour. Only some of them can trigger changes in spike protein.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/is-double-mutant-variant-serious-only-more-research-will-tell/articleshow/81693917.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Reunited at the police station, their story had a happy ending when the brothers could finally go home together. Anish (22) and Mandar (16) came to Pune from their hometown in West Bengal last year. Anish started working in Pune. Three months ago, Mandar travelled to Panvel and went missing. An anxious Anish moved to Mumbai to look for his brother. Meanwhile, Mandar wandered about by himself and landed in Kandivli East. He started living on the pavement and befriended Anwar (17) who lives in a chawl at Hanuman Nagar with his parents. “The boys got hooked to drugs and began to look for ways to make money to fund the habit,” said a police officer. According to investigators, Mandar attempted to break into an electronics store at Kandivli’s Akurli Road but was not successful. He then teamed up with Anwar. Late on March 17, the two minors smashed cement sheets to gain entry into the store. They scooped up 21 cellphones and fled. When the store owner lodged a complaint at Samta Nagar police station, sleuths checked the CCTV footage. The youngsters had been caught on camera. Their images were circulated among informants and the boys were detained from an autorickshaw stand in Lokhandwala Complex. “We recovered 10 phones worth Rs 1.2 lakh,” said detection officer Vijay Raskar. As both teens did not have a past criminal history and the offence invites a punishment of less than seven years, they weren’t sent to an observation home. Anwar was sent with his parents but Mandar told cops he had been separated from his brother. Police then began to look for Anish and took help from people who were from the brothers’ hometown. It turned out Anish now lived in Borivli. Both brothers were reunited at the police station and went home. Police said the minors would be counselled about making a better life and keeping off crime and drugs.

---||Delhi||From DU student leader to a life of murder, extortion||New Delhi: Rohit Chaudhary's transformation from a student leader at Shaheed Bhagat Singh College to a top 10 wanted gangster could make a good movie script. It began around a decade ago with political rivalry, which led him to his first murder. Over the next few years, he has had the cops in pursuit for his involvement in dozens of cases of murder, extortion, land-grabbing and robbery. Bhisham Singh, DCP (Crime), grudgingly said that Chaudhary had been very innovative when evading arrest. He made clever use of technology to avoid being pinpointed. He used his phone dongle's internet and VOIP apps to communicate, taking care not to mount any SIM card in his phone. Ironically, the cops outdid him after being tipped off about his modus operandi by two of his associates they had arrested. Chaudhary’s latest was to join hands with gangster Ankit Gujjar to form the Chaudhary-Gujjar syndicate that was focused on expanding their network in south Delhi. The cops have intercepted the former’s calls to Gujjar who is lodged in Tihar jail and will, therefore, interrogate the imprisoned criminal too. Till a few years ago, Chaudhary was in cahoots with another gangster, Prince. However, they parted ways after being arrested together in a Lado Sarai murder case in 2015. While operating from jail, they became arch rivals and their gang members have been attacking each other since then. The rivalry is mostly over extortion of money from builders and bookies. Last May, Chaudhary's hitmen gunned down 28-year-old Prince in south Delhi’s Pushp Vihar when the gangster was walking towards a mall with friends after appearing at a hearing in a Saket court nearby. Chaudhary and his men, Badal, Satender and Ashfaq, fired at Prince from close range, killing him at the spot. In November 2019, Chaudhary gunned down another rival, Sudhir, at a marriage function in Hapur, making it to UP police's wanted list. A Crime Branch officer said they discovered that several young boys had joined Chaudhary's gang of late, having been lured with promises of a lavish lifestyle, luxury cars and dominance in society. “Many of these gang members turned out to be first timers when arrested in cases of extortion or shootouts,” the officer disclosed. The cops will interrogate Chaudhary about the land-grab syndicate he was running in Aya Nagar and other areas in south Delhi. They are now in pursuit of his absconding associates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/from-du-student-leader-to-a-life-of-murder-extortion/articleshow/81695686.cms||---

Something which ought to have been completed long ago is now sought to be done. We direct the divisional commissioner and AIIMS director to coordinate and ensure that 198 additional beds are set up without any excuse,” a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Avinash Gharote said, adding that at least 50% of them should be oxygenated ones. The bench expressed satisfaction with government pleader (GP) Ketki Joshi’s submission on beds availability in the city’s hospitals while hearing a suo motu PIL based on a TOI report. Shreerang Bhandarkar, who has been appointed amicus curiae, said several beds were available for admitting Covid-19 patients. “However, it would be necessary for the authorities to also think of the future. Therefore, as directed earlier, additional beds should be created within a week from today,” the judges said, while adjourning the hearing till April 5. Earlier, Joshi informed that outside Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s (NMC) limits, the total beds in the district are 1,359, of which 797 are unoccupied. Of them 658 are oxygenated and 139 are ICUs. Within NMC limits, GMCH has 600 beds of which 155 are vacant. Of vacant ones, 130 are oxygenated and 17 are ICUs. In Indira Gandhi Government Medical Colleges and Hospital (IGGMCH), out of 522 beds, 85 are vacant. Of these, 30 are oxygenated and 20 are ICUs. The GP added that the process for setting up additional 400 oxygenated beds at GMCH is underway and authorities are hopeful that it will be completed in next two weeks. WHAT HC SAID * If new difficulties are expressed at last hour, it will not be helpful to come out of emergency situation * Something which ought to have been completed long ago is now sought to be done * Div commissioner & AIIMS director to ensure 198 additional beds are set up without any excuse * It would be necessary for authorities also to think of future & set up new beds in a week||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/set-up-addl-covid-beds-in-one-week-hc/articleshow/81693928.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Besides, some are also working with the corporation’s property tax department. Chawla said that stringent action is needed to control dengue and chikungunya cases. “Fogging is the last option and done only during peak season as it leads to pollution. Besides checking mosquito breeding, anti-larval actions are required, which requires staff. I have told officials to write to the department concerned for the reason for withdrawing staff and take action before things go out of control,” he said.A corporation official said that SDMC has received many calls and letters from RWAs and market associations to tackle the mosquito menace as desired action is lacking at sites that perennially see mosquito breeding. “As many institutions, education centres and offices are not yet fully operational, we are asking them to depute nodal officers to check breeding and anti-larval activities. From our side, some staffers have been asked to visit as many sites as possible sites while taking all precautions,” said the civic official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cant-spare-health-staff-for-covid-19-duty-sdmc/articleshow/81696403.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Convict flees from Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital amid shootout||NEW DELHI: There was high drama on the premises of Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital on Thursday afternoon when Delhi Armed Police personnel shot dead a criminal and critically injured another. The duo was targeted after a group of men tried to free a convict, Kuldeep Maan alias Fajja, who had been brought from Mandoli jail to the hospital for a check-up. Fajja’s rescuers, who came in a Scorpio SUV sporting a police sticker, first shot in the air and then threw chilli powder at the cops before trying to free the convict from police custody. But the police personnel recovered quickly and shot at them, hitting two. In the melee, the men fled in different directions, leaving their Scorpio behind. One of the wounded died there while the other collapsed and was taken into custody. A manhunt has been launched to apprehend the missing convict and his associates. Terming the prompt action by the police escort as heroic, Delhi Police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal said that this was a bold response from the 3rd Battalion to the attack. The personnel involved are likely to be rewarded for their bravery. According to police, Fajja was brought to the hospital for consultancy about his abdominal problems, for which he has visited the medical centre several times in the past couple of months. A team of four policemen escorted him out after the check-up, while the fifth cop finished the paperwork inside. Outside, 5-8 men used their firearms even as one of them caught a cop from behind. When the policeman tried to retaliate, he found his service pistol locking on him, so he shouted to his fellow cops to open fire. At least 20 rounds were fired, 12 by the policemen escorting Fajja. In the commotion, Fajja and his rescuers managed to escape, though two men were hit by gunfire. Ravi Jagassi was hit on his chest and collapsed while trying to run towards Gate No 1, while Ankesh, who sustained two bullet wounds on his abdomen, fell near the waste plant and was overpowered. He is undergoing treatment. Two others ran towards Gate No 7 where they accosted a man, Kapil Yadav, who had come from UP for his wife’s pregnancy check-up. The duo threatened Yadav with a pistol and took his motorcycle. While riding away, they fired three rounds in the air to keep chasers at bay. Yadav, his pregnant wife and a relative all escaped any harm. Vinay Pal, who runs a food stall and is the eyewitness to the motorcycle robbery, recalled, “We heard gunshots and some commotion. We immediately ran to find cover, but in the meantime two men rushed out and pushed a man who was about to sit on his motorcycle. The man was with two women, including his wife who appeared pregnant. The man fell down and found a pistol pointed at his face. He was relieved of his bike, and the attackers fired in the air while fleeing on the bike.” Police recovered around four pistols from the crime scene as well as some clothes and weapons from the abandoned Scorpio. Investigations have so far revealed that the SUV had a fake Delhi number plate. The owner was later traced to Haryana. “A team has been sent to Haryana to check the records of the car,” said R Sathiyasundaram, DCP (Shahdara). “None of the attackers had their faces covered, so we are trying to trace them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/convict-flees-from-hospital-amid-shootout/articleshow/81696394.cms||Sakshi Chand

The court passed the order on a petition challenging the public hearing conducted by the North Goa collector on March 7 this year. A division bench comprising Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice M S Sonak said, “We are of the considered prima facie opinion that the allegation of the hearing being a mere ritual, levelled by the petitioners, cannot be totally ruled out. In such view of the matter, we restrain the respondents from proceeding further on the basis of the minutes of the impugned hearing dated March 7, 2021, for a period of three weeks or until further orders, whichever is earlier.” Although the court stated that the concerns ought to have been raised before the National Green Tribunal, it took cognisance of the fact that the western zone bench of the tribunal at Pune has not been functional. Earlier this month, the court had suggested that the petitioners approach the tribunal since that was the alternative remedy available to them. The court passed the order on the petition filed by Anthony Francis Vas and others. The court called for replies from the government to reach it by April 1. In a related case, several villagers from coastal villages along with Goa Foundation filed a PIL challenging public hearings in North and South Goa. Rampokarancho Ekvott and other fishing organisations and individuals filed a PIL challenging the South Goa public hearing at Ravindra Bhavan. The PIL challenged the legality of the public hearings stating that although they are coastal dwellers who will be affected by the CZMPs they were denied full opportunity to present their objections to the GCZMA at the public hearing. The petitioners approached the high court stating that the public hearings stand conducted and completed by the government and will be sent to appropriate authorities for further action as per norms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/hc-stops-govt-from-going-ahead-with-czmp-process/articleshow/81696420.cms||---
---||Lucknow||UP records sharp dip in crime against women: NCRB data||LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh has recorded a significant decrease in the rate of crime against women, according to National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB). The state has also recorded a dip in heinous cases of crime in comparison to previous years, according to NCRB records. “According to latest data by NCRB, despite being the most populous state, UP, under the effective leadership of chief minister Yogi Adityanath, has witnessed a sharp reduction of 45.43% in rape cases and has the lowest figures of crime against women compared to 21 major states of the country,” said ADG, law and order, Prashant Kumar. Kumar mentioned that the all-India rate of crime against women in 2019 was 62.4 cases per one lakh population, while UP recorded 55.4 cases per lakh, based on the NCRB police records. “Schemes introduced by the state government for women’s security helped in controlling crime,” said Kumar. The officer cited how intensified patrolling by UP 112 has provided security to the industrial establishment. “In urban areas the response time of UP-112 patrol vehicles has reduced to 3 minutes,” said Kumar. Moreover, conviction rate in crime against women cases in the state was the highest in 2019. ADG, prosecution, Ashutosh Pandey said that efforts of prosecution in perusal of cases has got UP the top spot in conviction rate of crime against women. “In UP, the conviction rate in 2019 was 55% as compared to Uttarakhand at 50% and Rajasthan 45.5%,” he said. Even other crimes have reduced. A senior officer said that with a density of 690 persons per square km, UP being the largest state in terms of population, has witnessed a sharp decline of 19% from 2016 to 2020 in cases of murder. Murder cases registered a reduction of 5.9% in 2017 with 28,653 cases, down from 30,450 in 2016, the report said. According to the NCRB report, the rate of murder cases in UP in 2016 was 2.2 cases per one lakh population, while 2017 recorded 1.9 cases of murder per one lakh population, 2018 recorded 1.8 and 2019 and 2020 recorded 1.7 and 1.6 murder cases per one lakh population, respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-records-sharp-dip-in-crime-against-women-ncrb-data/articleshow/81696402.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Gangster who himself fled from custody behind GTB plot||NEW DELHI: Gangster Sandeep Alias Kala Jathedi, who is believed to be shuttling between Dubai and Bangkok, is suspected of having provided the logistical support for the attempt to free Kuldeep Maan alias Fajja from custody on Thursday. Fajja, who is the Man Friday of gangster Jitender Gogi, is lodged in Mandoli jail and is believed to be planning to flee the country. Jathedi, who escaped from police custody from Faridabad, Haryana, in February 2020, has a reward of Rs 7 lakh for his arrest. He had been working to expand his syndicate’s footprints in Delhi. To that purpose he joined hands with jailed gangsters like Lawrence Bishnoi and Gogi, apart from another fugitive, Bangkok-based Kala Rana The cops surmise that the escape was planned with the objective either to make Fajja a free man and place him outside the country or for him to handle the syndicate’s operations outside jail. However, the latter is unlikely given that men more notorious than Fajja are already managing gang efforts, including contract killings. Delhi Police’s Special Cell has begun the probe into the case and will question Gogi and a criminal named Priyavrat, a jailed associate of Jathedi. The linkages between Ravi alias Chhota Boxer and Ankesh are also being determined. TOI spoke to associates of Fajja and Gogi, who claimed the former took the step because he had no other option for survival. “While jail officials will deny these claims, the fact is that Fajja’s life in jail was hell. He was being targeted for no reason,” confided a former gang member. “He was in isolation for months in Jail No 15 at Mandoli prison.” He added that none of the gang members had any inkling of an escape plan. The only indication suggesting a plan was afoot came last month when Fajja asked his kin to bring him new clothes in prison. “A few weeks ago, he asked for good clothes and said he was bored of wearing the same old jeans. His relatives brought some expensive clothes for him,” disclosed another source in the gang. Gogi and Fajja were arrested in a dramatic manner last year from a flat in Gurgaon. They have been at loggerheads with gangster Sunil Tajpuria alias Tillu, their rivalry having started with a student election some years ago at Shraddhanand College when they supported opposing candidates. The rivalry turned bloody after the elections when Tillu’s associate Deepak was murdered for allegedly harassing Gogi’s cousin. In 2015, Tillu killed Gogi’s friend, Arun Commando, triggering an all-out gang war. Gogi then killed Ravi Bhardwaj, Tillu’s henchman, and also singer Harshita Dahiya, who witnessed the murder his aide Dinesh Karala. The feud has taken a toll of more than 25 lives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/gangster-who-himself-fled-from-custody-behind-gtb-plot/articleshow/81696408.cms||Raj Shekhar
---||Aurangabad||Only 20% of Covid patients opting for home isolation||Aurangabad: While the Aurangabad civic administration has been officially encouraging home isolation for Covid patients with mild or no symptoms, the option has been evoking a mixed response. Many from densely populated localities living in small houses or having big families are averse to home isolation, others, especially those testing positive in groups. As per the official data, around 20% of Covid patients are currently opting for home isolation in Aurangabad. A private professional whose wife has tested positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday said he chose to admit her at a hospital. “I have an elderly mother and a son, whose Class XII examination is due. Fearing that the other family members may get infected, I decided to admit her instead of opting for home isolation,” he said. Another private professional, in his 30s, said he is taking treatment for Covid-19 at home. “I tested positive during the last weekend. Fortunately, my wife, children and other family members were out of station and I asked them to extend their stay till I complete my home isolation,” he said.A resident of the N-11 sector, said seven of his family members have tested positive. “I have admitted my aged parents to the hospital while rest are in home isolation as they do not have major symptoms,” he said. While capping the charges for home isolation in Aurangabad, local civic body chief Astik Kumar Pandey has already encouraged such option for asymptomatic or patients with mild symptoms. “Those who are taking home treatment must not venture out any cost. If any such patient found loitering on roads or moving in public, we will take serious action,” Pandey said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/only-20-of-covid-patients-opting-for-home-isolation/articleshow/81693347.cms||---
---||Delhi||For every 1°C rise in temperature, output of factories dips by 2%||NEW DELHI: With every one degree rise in the average annual temperature, plants in Delhi and across the country are showing a drop in productivity by around 2% annually, a new study carried out by the University of Chicago has found. With the average annual temperature gradually rising over the years, India’s gross domestic product (GDP) output may be affected in the long run. It is likely to lead to lower year-on-year growth, according to the latest study. The study, which analysed India’s average annual temperature between 1998 and 2014, used several high-frequency microdata sets of worker output from over 58,000 factories across India. Productivity has been hit the most in labour-intensive plants, it says. The aggregate effects are large enough to significantly reduce the overall output and revenue of the manufacturing sector, the study adds. “The effect of high temperatures on lower crop yields has been previously established, however, this study shows that rising temperatures can also hurt economic output in other sectors by reducing the productivity of human labour. If India wishes to succeed in becoming a manufacturing powerhouse using cheap labour, we need to think hard about how we can adapt to a hotter world,” says Dr Anant Sudarshan, South Asia director of Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago. Sudarshan, who has co-authored the study with E Somanathan of Indian Statistical Institute in Delhi, Rohini Somanathan from the Delhi School of Economics and Meenu Tewari of University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, argues that while the focus of the study is on Indian manufacturing plants, it has implications for any sector where labour is important, such as construction or services. The study finds no negative effects of an increase in the temperature on output at climate-controlled plants in Dehii-NCR, indicating a possible need of adapting to the rising temperature demands. “In climate-controlled garment plants, we see no negative effects of temperature on output. For steel mills, which are largely automated and have climate control, output rises slightly at higher temperatures. This occurs if climate control is turned on only on hot days, making the workplace conditions on those days actually more comfortable,” says the study. In comparison, garment plants operating in the region without a climate control on the factory premises saw a reduction in the average daily efficiency by as much as 8% in a week, it adds. “We see that in the absence of climate control, worker productivity declines on hot days and we spot absenteeism even for workers in factories with cooling facilities. When you compound that with limited adoption of climate control technologies in manufacturing industries, you know that we are dealing with a complex problem here,” says E Somanathan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/for-every-1c-rise-in-temperature-output-of-factories-dips-by-2/articleshow/81696416.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

Launching 300 Swachh auto tippers (SATs) here along with animal husbandry minister Talasani Srinivas Yadav, KTR said the second wave of Covid-19 is likely to hit the state soon and instructed the officials to be on total guard. The minister said the onus of keeping the city clean lies with people too. “Swachhta is not only the responsibility of GHMC or the government, people also should participate in the drive in door-to-door collection of waste and garbage and segregation,” he said. He said the GHMC had decided to press into service 650 new SATs and 300 of them were introduced in the first phase. “To make Hyderabad a garbage bin-free city, door-to-collection should increase. This is the reason why the SATs have been introduced,” he said. The SATs will be pressed into service in all the six zones of the GHMC. Officials said the vehicles are hydraulically operated with a closed container. They have separators for segregation of wet and dry waste, which are in compliance with the Waste Management Rules of 2016. Vijaya Laxmi said 10 more solid waste management plants will come up in the city. “Our goal is ‘Swacch Hyderabad’ with garbage-free streets and roads across the city. We are working on different techniques of solid waste management and waste collection systems to attain the tag of zero garbage city shortly, “ she said. Gearing up for Swachh Survekshan Rankings 2021, the GHMC has removed bins from many parts of the city. Bins spotted by the central government teams attract negative marks in Swachh score card. In order to avoid piled up garbage in the city where the bins used to be there, SATs are being pressed into service, an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/onus-of-keeping-city-clean-lies-with-people-too-ktr/articleshow/81696423.cms||Nabinder Bommala
---||Kolkata||Passport touts block Metro construction||Kolkata: Fresh trouble is brewing for the priority Ruby-Kavi Subhas stretch of the New Garia-Airport Metro corridor. Around 30 encroachers, who are actually touts operating out of makeshift stalls in front of the Passport Seva Kendra (PSK), have stalled construction of an entrance of the Metro station at the Ruby crossing, demanding permanent rehabilitation. Rail Vikas Nigam Ltd (RVNL), the implementing agency of the 32km New Garia-Airport Metro, needs the site to build one of the foot overbridges (FOBs) to access the Hemanta Mukherjee station. They have already vacated an adjacent spot, which used to be occupied by another group of touts, next to the Toyota building for one of the entry structures. But 29 touts have now set up a banner — Ruby Hawkerbrinda (Ruby Hawkers’ Group) — to demand that RVNL builds permanent structures for them. The touts claimed that they had been operating here ever since the Anandapur PSK office on EM Bypass was set up 15 years ago. “Everyone knows that we are the ‘passport agents’ here. Suddenly, we are being asked to move out because of the Metro construction. The authorities are known to rehabilitate people who come in the way of the Metro construction. They should also do something for us,” said Manoj Biswas, one of the signatories of Ruby Hawkerbrinda. The touts actually help the computer-illiterate fill in the passport applications. Even as PSK officials insist that people should avoid them, scores of passport applicants turn to them every day and the latter diligently “help them out”. A senior RVNL engineer said: “KMDA told us to remove the barricades on the opposite side of the service road so the touts could set up some shanties. Now, after we have done so, they are saying they won’t budge unless we build permanent shops for them. We have no such provisions under the Rehabilitation Act.” KMDA are the keepers of EM Bypass. A KMDA official said, “Discussions are on with Ruby Hawkerbrinda so that the site can be freed.” RVNL has been chasing an internal deadline of this year’s December to complete Phase 1 — the stretch between the Ruby crossing (Hemanta Mukherjee station) and New Garia (Kavi Subhas station). It is currently building the FOB next to the Income Tax building as one of the accesses to Hemanta Mukherjee station. The agency must complete all the entry and exit points of the stations in the next few months. Construction is also on at the Avishikta crossing as RVNL finally got the site a month ago. The proposed Ruby flyover had emerged as a major hurdle here as an arm of the flyover turning right to Anwar Shah Road, was clashing with a Metro pillar. KMDA has done away with the flyover arm. RVNL, in turn, agreed to pull down two smaller pillars that are part of the station to accommodate the flyover.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/passport-touts-block-metro-construction/articleshow/81694913.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

The man, aged 40 and hailing from Daulatabad, had five warrants pending against him for defaulting on alimony of his two wives. The family court issued a non-bailable warrant against him and asked police to produce him before it. Inspector Rajshri Adhe of the Daulatabad police station told TOI that Kharat summoned the man to the police station on Monday evening. The documentation process of the warrants took a few hours. Later, around 3.30 am on Tuesday, the suspect was kept in a lock-up at the City Chowk police station. According to the officer, around 10am, Kharat produced the man before the court, which asked him to pay alimony of Rs 60,000 and Rs 1.32 lakh in two different cases. The man could not arrange the money by evening, following which he was remanded in judicial custody. The head constable was personally holding the man so that he did not flee. Kharat said, “Before handing him over to the prison authorities, a mandatory medical test was performed and he tested positive for Covid-19. The prison authorities, however, refused to take him in. With no clear instructions about handling of a Covid patient, I was compelled to take him to three different Covid centres in police vehicle for several hours.” It was only after the constable called inspector Rajshri Adhe and alerted the police control room about it, senior police officers, including DCP Khatmode Patil, intervened and got the suspect admitted to a Covid care centres post midnight. The 50-year-old policeman has been granted leave by senior police officers. DCP (Zone-I) Nikesh Khatmode Patil said that lack of clarity about SOP resulted in our policeman getting exposed to a Covid-positive patient for over 24 hours. Aurangabad central prison’s superintendent Jayant Naik said, “The suspect should have been directly taken to a Covid centre for treatment, instead of bringing him to the prison.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/jail-rejects-covid-patient-puts-cop-in-tight-spot/articleshow/81693352.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Delhi||Delhi: Need for speed? 150 hi-tech cameras should deter you||NEW DELHI: The year 2020 changed many things. Among them was replacement of issuance of challans by policemen on the roads with camera-based prosecutions. After the lockdown was eased, traffic cameras helped fine motorists violating speed limits and other rules. Calling it a futuristic technique, Delhi Traffic Police will now be installing around 150 speed-detection and red-light violation cameras at 31 prime locations in the city by the end of this month. A senior police officer said these cameras proved to be very effective for violations because traffic cops on the road cannot screen all cars that travel beyond the speed limit. However, cameras equipped with detecting this violation can track every vehicle. TimesViewSpeeding vehicles are a major traffic problem in the city. Using more speed cameras is an appropriate move. It will reduce manual policing, which is not only risky for traffic cops but also an avenue for corruption.From March 24 till the end of May in 2020, there weren’t many cars on the roads. However, as soon as the lockdown restrictions were relaxed, there was a heavy influx of vehicles causing a sudden spike in the number of challans being issued. This was also the first time when police stopped using alcometer to catch drunk drivers. “Since social distancing had to be maintained, the department relied heavily on camera-based fines to ensure the safety of commuters and its own staff,” said an officer. By March 31 this year, traffic police are looking to install 50 additional speed-detection cameras at 25 locations. Another 100 red-light detection cameras will be set up at six junctions where multiple violations are detected. They would be equipped to record violations like jumping red signals, stop-line violations and driving against the flow of traffic. These cameras also record speeding offences. While the speed-detection cameras will be installed on Mathura Road, Mahatma Gandhi Road, NH-48, Rohtak Road and Mukarba Chowk, the red-light violation cameras will be set up at Peeragarhi Chowk, Britannia Chowk, Azadpur Chowk and Burari. Currently, the city has over 150 cameras installed at 37 locations, including ITO, Naraina, Rao Tula Ram Marg, Dwarka, Dhaula Kuan, Sarai Kale Khan, Mayapuri, among other places. In 2020, 13,802,973 challans were issued against 10,580,249 in 2019. Traffic officers said that last year the department made progress in digitally serving notices to offenders. Now, they are working towards sending more challans through SMS. By making linking of mobile numbers mandatory while registering vehicles, traffic police were able to send over 60% of the total challans via SMS. Till 2019, this figure was only around 49%. Since people are getting notices on phones, challan payments have also gone up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/need-for-speed-150-hi-tech-cameras-should-deter-you/articleshow/81695699.cms||Pankhuri Yadav
---||Nagpur||NMC to start six 24-hr vaccination centres from April 1||NAGPUR: The civic administration and elected representatives were at loggerheads over the sudden spurt of Covid-19 cases in the city. During the NMC general body meeting held virtually on Thursday, the elected representatives blamed the administration for the spike in coronavirus cases, while administration claimed it was doing its best to fight the pandemic. Corporators from across all parties claimed that the spike in coronavirus cases was due to NMC’s callous attitude and said that the present Covid situation was worse than what the city witnessed in September last year. Not only government hospitals but private hospitals also do not have beds, said Corporators, and stressed the need to restart quarantine centres or Covid Care Centres across the city. Positive patients with mild infections should be admitted in quarantine centres, while only serious patients should be admitted in hospitals, they said. Senior corporator Abha Pande claimed that influential positive patients without having any serious health complications have occupied beds in hospitals. “So hospitalisations should be allowed only for needy patients,” she said. Mayor Dayashankar Tiwari directed the civic administration to increase the number of vaccination centres and also to start one 24-hour vaccination centre in every assembly constituency from April 1. The issue was discussed in the general body meeting following an adjournment motion moved by former mayor Pravin Datke. Replying to Datke’s motion, additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi informed the house that there are 79 private hospitals treating Covid-19 patients. All these hospitals have 2,936 beds including 1,839 oxygenated beds, 994 ICU beds and 261 beds with ventilator facilities. Similarly, the eight government-run hospitals have 1,515 beds comprising 1,152 oxygenated beds, 319 ICU beds and 271 beds with ventilator facilities. Joshi also claimed that both private and government hospitals had beds available as on Thursday morning. However, his claim was refuted by Corporators, including Pande, who maintained that even government hospitals like GMCH had a waiting period for admitting positive patients. Lack of beds is leading to death of patients with severe complications due to Covid-19 infection, they informed the house. Tiwari advised the civic chief to see whether Covid-19 tests can be moved to places like community halls or any other public places from primary health centres. The existing PHCs can be utilized for vaccinations, said the mayor. Congress Corporators Kamlesh Chowdhary and Nitin Sathawane raised the issue of private hospitals charging more from Covid-19 patients for medicines. Senior Congress corporator Praful Gudadhe and BJP corporator Sunil Hiranwar raised the issue of lack of facilities in NMC-run Indira Gandhi Rugnalaya. They drew attention of the house towards lack of ICU facility and shortage of staff in the civic run hospital. Mayor directed the administration to look into the matter urgently. Most of the Corporators raised the issue of administration’s failure to keep a strict check on home quarantine patients. According to them, Covid-19 positive patients were roaming freely on city streets. The mayor directed the administration to take help of non-government organisations and their volunteers to keep a check on home quarantine patients. He also urged the Corporators to ensure all home quarantine people in their respective prabhags stay inside.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-to-start-six-24-hr-vaccination-centres-from-april-1/articleshow/81694007.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

---||Aurangabad||Lockdown option mooted for Aurangabad, says Desai||Aurangabad: Stating that the health authorities have underlined the need of lockdown in Aurangabad to reduce the burden of active Covid-19 cases on the health machinery, district guardian minister Subhash Desai on Thursday said that such an extreme option is being mooted by the government. “Taking note of recommendations made by the health authorities, we are mooting the option of lockdown in Aurangabad. We will discuss the Covid situation with other experts and necessary stand would be declared shortly,” he said. Addressing media in Aurangabad, Desai said that a section of public representatives have also pressed for blanket closure to put check on daily rise in fresh Covid cases. “The projections made by health authorities on possible spread of Covid-19 in next few days are scary. We have to act early on different fronts before it is too late to respond,” he said. Amid official talks of another lockdown, Desai, a senior Shiv Sena leader, said that the government was equally worried over loss of employment and livelihood issues faced by many due to blanket ban on activities. “We have already explored the option of lockdown during weekends in Aurangabad among other measures aimed at containing the spread of Covid-19. Despite these measures, there is sharp rise in daily cases over a period of last few days,” he said. Sharing details of review meeting he held with different local authorities, Desai said that he has asked for increasing the total number of Covid testing facilities in Aurangabad district to 500. “Minimum 10,000 tests must be conducted in the district as early testing helps in arresting the spread of the infection. The authorities have been asked to ensure sufficient number of beds and ventilators for Covid patients” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/lockdown-option-mooted-for-aurangabad-says-desai/articleshow/81693356.cms||---

It is the first time since 2003 when the corporation was formed that such motion has been tabled. The special general body meeting was organised in Malegaon corporation at 4 pm in the presence of mayor Tahera Rasheed Shaikh, deputy mayor Nilesh Aher, deputy commissioner Nitin Kapadnis among others. The no confidence motion was tabled by corporator Rasheed Shaikh of Congress. He was seconded by Shiv Sena member Sakharam Ghodke, BJP member Sunil Gaikwad and Janata Dal member Mutakeen Dignity. While one seat is vacant following the death of a member, two members of All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) and a member of Shiv Sena did not turn up for the motion as they were ill. “Of the 80 members present, all of them voted in favour of the motion,” said mayor Tahera Shaikh. The mayor told TOI that the members were unhappy with the working of the MMC commissioner who would often fail to turn up to the corporation office and was incompetent. She said the commissioner had failed to give work orders for repairing of Girna pumping station and solar power project which were most required for the corporation. The commissioner was on his way to construct a jumbo Covid centre when it was not required. It was finally stopped after the issue was raised with Nashik collector, Shaikh said. The mayor also alleged that the officer failed to take the members into confidence for the developmental works. “The commissioner only cleared the files he wanted,” she said.In the no confidence motion, 28 members of Congress, 26 of Mahagathbandhan Aghadi, 12 of Shiv Sena, nine of BJP, five of AIMIM voted in favour of the motion. “The motion will now be presented to the minister of the urban development department. The minister’s signature is required for the acceptance of the proposal,” she said. Meanwhile, commissioner Deepak Kasar held a press conference in the first half of the day where he said he was not incompetent and that the proposal was mooted since he had did not approve projects without proper verification to prevent the misuse of public funds.“Members present the dockets, the House sanctions the same and the works are carried out. I only execute the orders. Besides, I firmly believe the works of the pumping station and solar project were not in the interest of the economic situation of the corporation. Hence, I have not issued work order regarding the same,” said Kasar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/no-confidence-motion-passed-against-malegaon-civic-chief/articleshow/81693373.cms||Abhilash Botekar

---||Nagpur||Nimgade case: CBI filed closure report in December, didn’t inform son||NAGPUR: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had filed closure report (‘A’ summary) before the judicial magistrate first class (JMFC) in the Eknath Nimgade murder case in December last year. This was three months before city police cracked the case and nabbed a dozen suspects in March. Despite the efforts of city police, CBI is yet to take the suspects into formal custody citing technical issues. Anupam Nimgade, son of 72-year-old architect Eknath, who was shot dead in September 2016, said he was surprised the manner in which the first investigation officer (IO) inspector Bose had taken voluntary retirement abruptly, while conducting the probe. “Bose had been sincerely trying to crack the case. He also coordinated with me and shared details of developments when possible. His retirement was a surprise,” said Anupam, who had filed a petition before the high court after the murder seeking a transfer to CBI from city police. Anupam also shared his disillusionment with the investigation agency and the latest IO Chachere. “Chachere rarely came down to city and spoke to me, unless I called up and inquired about developments. He had called me up in December last year to say CBI was closing the case,” said Anupam. The Nimgade family had earlier named a prominent leader and former minister from Nagpur district as possible conspirator, since he had been threatening the victim over a property dispute. “I had already named several suspects in my statements and offered the clues we had, but still no one was able to crack the case for five years, and they had almost closed it. Also, they did not even think of giving me a copy of the closure report to file a protest petition,” he said. Anupam sounded miffed the way his father’s murder was being ‘politicized’ for ‘mileage’ by politicians who aren’t even aware of the details of the case. “Politicians could not even recall whether my father was ‘Eknath Khadse’ or Eknath Nimgade. Even the basic homework was not done by them,” said Anupam, sounding disappointed with the political mudslinging over his father’s murder. Senior NCP leader Vedprakash Arya said he had raised the same issues which were part of Anupam’s statement before the police during the agitations. “We are now approaching police to give the Nimgades security,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nimgade-case-cbi-filed-closure-report-in-dec-didnt-inform-son/articleshow/81694037.cms||Soumitra Bose

We need to question some personnel there as they were in contact with those arrested.”The Secunderabad ARO under the Madras recruiting zone is responsible for holding recruitment rallies in southern states.Another senior police officer said, “Investigations have established the role of an ex-serviceman running a private academy in Secunderabad. He is on the run.”The officer said, “The ex-serviceman had forwarded a question paper to Major Vilas Vijay Kilari arrested from Delhi via a social networking site. He had forwarded the paper to Major Theru Murugan Tangvelu in Tamil Nadu. This officer, in contact with other serving personnel in Maharashtra, had forwarded the paper to them.

---||Kolhapur||Massive production of sugar on cards||Kolhapur: The state is heading for record sugar production during the current crushing season as factories have crushed over 900 lakh tonne of cane till date. With this the state is all set to break its record of cane crushing and sugar production for the past decade. According to official data released by the office of the sugar commissioner, mills across the state had crushed 939 lakh tonne of cane till March 24 and produced 979 lakh quintal of sugar . The highest crushing in the past decade took place in 2018-19 when factories crushed 953 metric tonne of sugar cane. In the last crushing season Maharashtra had crushed 464 lakh tonne of cane till March 15. However, the number of factories involved in the activity last year was less as compared to this year. Last year, 144 mills were involved in the crushing season, while this year the number has gone up to 188. Sugar expert PG Medhe said the number of factories opting for crushing has gone up because of bumper cane production due to good rainfall across the state. “Maharashtra currently has around 11 lakh hectare under cane cultivation which was around eight lakh hectare the previous year. Around 1,100 lakh quintal of sugar will be produced by the end of crushing season,” he said. “The lowest cane crushing was recorded in 2016-17 when only 373 lakh tonne of cane was crushed. Farmers had stayed away from sugar cane crop that year because of drought-like situation,” he added. Officials said that state is sure to cross the 953-lakh tonne record as 129 sugar mills are still crushing the cane. Out of 188 sugar mills that had obtained license for crushing for the current season only 59 factories have stopped crushing. The fortnightly crushing data released by sugar commissioner’s office till March 15 stated that a total of 188 sugar mills had crushed 828 lakh tonne of cane as against 464 lakh tonne till the same time last season. In western Maharashtra, 136 mills are engaged in crushing activity and they have crushed around 350 lakh tonne of cane. In Marathwada, 47 mills have crushed by 175 lakh tonne of sugar cane by the end March 15. Massive cane crushing is also reflected in generation of bills, based on fair and remunerative price (FRP), to be paid to the farmers. Factories in state have generated Rs 18,221 crore of bill payable to the farmers — till March 15. Till the same time in the last crushing season, Maharashtra had generated a total payable bill of Rs. 10,733 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/massive-production-of-sugar-on-cards/articleshow/81693358.cms||---

---||Delhi||IIT-Delhi to establish atmospheric observatory at its Sonipat campus||New Delhi: To combat climate change and air pollution problems, the Centre for Atmospheric Sciences (CAS) of IIT-Delhi plans to establish an observatory on the institute’s campus in Sonipat in Haryana.According to IIT-D, much remains to be done to develop a full understanding of the processes of climate change, which will be required for making predictions and policy interventions. The observatory will be up at Sonipat as it is “located upwind of NCR and is an ideal location for measurements not only of transport of dust and air pollution, but also various meteorological, radiation and cloud observations as these are key to understanding daily variations in weather and long-term climate changes.”Head of CAS Krishna Achuta Rao said that the observatory will be equipped with state-of-the-art equipment such as meteorological tower, wind profilers, radars for cloud and rain observations, greenhouse gas monitors and instruments for radiation and air pollution measurements such as aerosol chemical speciation monitor, particle sizer, spectrometers, particle counter and activity analyser, etc.“The ground-based and satellite observations will help us understand how the pollutants are formed and transported, how they affect air quality, extreme weather and global warming. This will help us to build better models to predict air quality, make more accurate forecasts of monsoon, extreme weather conditions and severe air pollution events. Continuous, long-term monitoring will help us get precise estimates of trends and better understanding of the impacts of policy interventions to minimise the staggering health and economic impacts of air pollution and climate change,” IIT-D said.Announcing the initiative through videoconferencing, Madhavan Nair Rajeevan, secretary, ministry of earth sciences, promised full support from the ministry for the plan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/iit-delhi-to-establish-atmospheric-observatory-at-its-sonipat-campus/articleshow/81696427.cms||---

While speaking to the media in Delhi, Raut said Deshmukh’s resignation would set a wrong precedent. Dismissing doubts on whether an impartial probe would be possible with Deshmukh still occupying the home minister’s post, he said. “There is no such tradition. If a retired high court judge probes, there is no need to resign.” He also raised doubts on the ‘letter bomb’. “There are doubts whether Singh wrote the letter, or someone wrote it and he signed it, ” Raut said. A day after his unceremonious exit, Singh had written a letter to CM Uddhav Thackeray alleging that Deshmukh had asked arrested API Sachin Waze to mobilise Rs 100 crore a month from establishments. Singh had mentioned that the issue was brought to the notice of the CM, his deputy and NCP chief Sharad Pawar, but no action was taken. Hours after CM Uddhav Thackeray announced a judicial probe into Singh’s allegations, Deshmukh tweeted a letter he had written to Thackeray seeking a probe. “There is no truth in the allegations made by Singh on me.

The health ministry’s list of specified comorbidities decides who in the age group 45 to 59 can take the jab. An over 45-year-old visually-impaired person is perhaps the only disabled person in the age-appropriate group to take the jab at AIIMS Nagpur on Wednesday. The beneficiary questioned the authorities and the media for not publicizing the fact enough to help many more like him. There are around 9,000 disabled persons in the district. When asked, an AIIMS Nagpur spokesperson referred to the list of comorbidities having inclusion of such persons. However, the health department preferred to interpret the vaccination policy as being limited to people with multiple disabilities. “Firstly, we didn’t have any specific guidelines for carrying out a special drive for the disabled person. There is no harm if a disabled person has been inoculated. Soon, all above 45 can be inoculated,” a top officer from the department said. The accidental beneficiary told TOI that by now the disabled persons would have become eligible for the second dose like many others but now they will have to face the rush in the next phase from April 1 when anyone above 45 would be able to take the jab. Congress city unit Divyang cell president Dinesh Yadav said the different associations working for disabled persons were not taken into confidence. “I am not aware if we too are eligible for the jab. Yet, we request the authorities to provide home service or transportation for disabled person above 60 years,” he said. Abhijit Raut, project officer at District Disability Rehabilitation Centre which comes under the ministry of social of justice, said there is no awareness about the drive among disabled persons. “The regional health department must have created awareness about it. If I had got any instructions through social justice department, we too would have created awareness and requested such persons to take early benefit,” he said. Raut said since general public is was not fully aware, it is a bigger challenge to educate the disabled about the programme. “Yet, the local bodies are empowered to take decision in case there were no clear guidelines,” he said. NMC health officials said they were not aware if disable persons were eligible. “We didn’t’ have any such instructions but they can now take the jab from next month,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/visually-impaired-gets-jab-at-aiims-officials-unsure-about-eligibility/articleshow/81694045.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

MP had over 11000 active coronavirus cases on Thursday according to state health bulletin. “We should return to adhering to WHO guidelines,” said Dr Rajiv Singh. He went on to add, “If Covid-19 is spreading in your community, stay safe by taking some simple precautions, such as physical distancing, wearing a mask, keeping rooms well ventilated, avoiding crowds, cleaning your hands and coughing into a bent elbow or tissue.” As for testing per million, MP still remains low compared to several other states. Only 330 people per 100,000 have been tested for the infection in the state. Despite that, MP had a high positivity rate of 6.9% on Thursday. The rate of infection is defined as the number of confirmed cases in a state, divided by the total population.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/more-testing-adherence-to-norms-must-say-experts/articleshow/81694954.cms||---

Recipient Dipak Katole, a businessman, told TOI that his son was not able to donate liver due to medical complications and other eligible blood relatives were sceptical about the donation. “Doctors told us to find a donor. It was question of life and death for me. We live in a joint family and Pooja is wife of my nephew Tushar. She came forward to save my life,” said Katole. He praised Pooja for being fearless during the entire process. Pooja, who used to work for a business firm until her baby was born, said that unlike her other relatives, she never felt that liver donation is life threatening. “Instead of doing unnecessary Google search on the subject, I preferred to believe in doctors and save life of my father-in-law,” Pooja told TOI. The surgery was held in Vedanta Hospital, Gurgaon, in January second week. Both donor and receiver were given due care and it took almost two weeks for them to recover. Pooja has recovered and can perform her daily activities without any problem. She thanked her husband and family for supporting her decision. Katole too has resumed his work. “Awareness about live liver donation is still very limited in Nagpur and Vidarbha,” said multi-organ transplant surgeon Dr Rahul Saxena. “We rarely could perform live liver donation in Nagpur because people still feel that they will suffer from serious complications. But after skin, liver is the only organ that regenerates itself. Within weeks of the surgery, the donor gets liver regenerated,” he said. Dr Saxena added that live liver donation in the Katole family should inspire many others in the city. “We can significantly reduce the waiting list of liver receivers if eligible family members come forward for the live liver donation,” he said. Live liver donation is safe · Liver is the only organ after skin that regenerates itself · Only a part of liver (up to 50%) is taken from the donor and transplanted into receiver · Donor gets discharge within 6-7 days; stitches removed in 2-3 weeks · Liver regenerates itself in 6-8 weeks, proper care for three months enough · Donors must have a compatible blood type and liver anatomy that is suitable for donation · Live liver donation needs to be promoted, say doctors||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mother-of-toddler-donates-part-of-liver-to-father-in-law/articleshow/81694052.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

The compound effect of rise in prices of fertilizer and fuel will take its toll on the poor farmers and their produce. “The irony is that this price rise will eventually dampen spirits of the poor during Holi,” he said. The former UP CM said the worst is that the BJP is trying to divert people’s attention from such issues and focus on other matters in an attempt to push government’s failures under the carpet. On Wednesday, talking to the media in Rae Bareli, Akhilesh had said that the recent complaint about Azaan over loudspeaker in Prayagraj by Allahabad University Vice-Chancellor Sangeeta Srivastava was uncalled for.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/rising-prices-of-fertilizer-blow-to-farmers-sp-chief/articleshow/81696426.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

The police have booked them under section 188 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for disobeying orders duly promulgated by the authorities, apart from sections of Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 and other relevant acts. Citing serious surge in Covid-19 cases, district collector Sunil Chavan and commissioner of police Nikhil Gupta have jointly imposed night curfew — from 8 pm to 5 am — till April 4 across the district. Also, weekends are being observed as days with strict restrictions. Half a dozen of restaurants and leading food joints have also been sealed for catering to the customers beyond the permissible hours. Apart from this, different police teams have also slapped spot fine of Rs 500 each on 157 people who were found without face mask in public places. “Every person violating the Covid-related restrictions and not following due precautions is contributing towards the spread of the infection,” Gupta said. Apart from restricting movement during the night curfew, authorities have also issued directives to the fuel stations to give petrol and deisel only to those who have been classified under essential services. Already some of the leading fuel stations in Aurangabad city have been sealed for violating the order. Following action by the authorities, Petrol Dealers Association of Aurangabad released a statement stating that the citizens should note that all the fuel stations are following the No Mask, No fuel policy. “Fuel will be delivered to citizens from Monday to Friday from 5 am to 8 pm only.

---||Delhi||DU to release funds for research work, social sciences ‘left out’||New Delhi: With Delhi University now being an Institute of Eminence (IoE), it is pushing for research to improve its global ranking. It will be releasing funds to professors for research and development activities, an initiative that was stopped in 2015 under the previous dispensation. Speaking to TOI, DU acting vice-chancellor PC Joshi said IoE funds would be allocated to all departments and colleges. “There is an IoE governing council where teachers can apply with their projects and be vetted. We have already allocated around Rs 5 crore.” However, concerns were raised at the executive council (EC) meeting last week where a section of teachers claimed that the social science department may be kept out of these grants. Seema Das, an EC member, said, “We have heard that the university is allocating funds to teachers for R&D. We raised this issue last week and requested the university to look into the problems faced by the social science researchers.” The absence of grants started after 2015 under the then VC Yogesh Tyagi. “There was a time when project proposals for teachers were made after screening by experts, which has now stopped. Because of that, the research quotient has fallen. We do not even see many conferences and seminars in DU. The varsity can utilise the IoE funds for pushing research, both at the department and college levels,” said Pankaj Garg, former academic council member and associate professor. Abhijit Kundu, associate professor in sociology at Sri Venkateswara College, said, “For social science teachers, generating funds for research is difficult. The focus on higher education is to support research and project on their instrumentality and purpose. Social science is more relevant in the current times. We should also be considered so that we do not look for external funding. We hope the university understands that if teachers do not do enough research, they will not get necessary points required for promotion.” Joshi, however, clarified that plans were afoot to restart grants for research in social science departments at both the university and college levels.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/du-to-release-funds-for-research-work-social-sciences-left-out/articleshow/81695702.cms||Mohammad Ibrar

In addition to the ideas already received by the government, Rai claimed more suggestions will be collected from the experts in the field, with the implementation of the action plan expected by next winter.“On April 12 and 13, the capital will hold a round-table conference at the Delhi secretariat. All environmental experts and NGOs working in the region will be invited, so that we can formulate the next action plan,” Rai said.“Last year too, we had taken a lot of action against air pollution since October. We ran an anti-dust campaign in the city, used a bio-decomposer to stop stubble burning, began a ‘red light on, car off’ campaign, started a green war room and launched the Green Delhi app. We will take suggestions of experts and different organisations working on pollution to discuss and develop an action plan,” the environment minister added.TOI had earlier reported how the government had consulted 28 NGOs and experts in order to prepare the action plan, which included people from the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago, Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, IIT-Bombay, IIT-Kanpur, The Energy and Resources Institute, Council for Policy Research, Climate Trends and World Resource Institute, amongst others.“We have already been following the action plan drafted last year, which focuses on hotspots. This was after consultation with experts. A long-term action plan is also being formulated and more NGOs and experts have approached us. They will all be accommodated in the conference,” a DPCC official said.Rai also said that agencies must continue to monitor Delhi’s hotspots and ensure dust pollution norms are being followed. “Regular monitoring of all hotspots in Delhi should carry on. I am ordering to take action on the deadline of any department whose complaint is coming in the war room,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/panel-meet-with-experts-to-chalk-out-pollution-fight/articleshow/81696434.cms||---

Exams for such students will be postponed and can be done either in April or even after written exams are over. Such children should just be advised to take rest and be in isolation at home. City schools said the numbers were again on the rise at a time when the Board practical exams had started. Almost every day, a few are reporting sick and are unable to appear for their exams. Both the schools and the kids were under pressure about what would happen to their practical marks because the exams were progressing as per schedule and they were being marked absent. The written exams for CBSE would begin in May. Two students at Lakshmipat Singhania Academy have tested positive for Covid. They will not be able to take the ongoing practicals and have submitted medical certificates. “We were so tense about what to do. The CBSE circular came just in time,” said Meena Kak, principal. At BDMI, one Board student's mother is seriously ill and is getting treated in Delhi and has been asked to stay there and not come for his practical exam to school. “We have written to the Board with the details and the exam is being rescheduled for him,” said Vijaya Chowdhury, BDMI principal. Principal of other city schools like Birla High School and Indus Valley World School said they had asked teachers to counsel all Board students not to be afraid of disclosing their Covid reports because the exams can be rescheduled now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cbse-schools-postpone-board-exams-for-cov-kids/articleshow/81703200.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

---||Goa||Traumatised by Covid-19 isolations, recovered persons go for counselling||PANAJI: People who suffered from Covid-19 initially not only fought the disease, but also struggled with stigma, stress, isolation and anxiety. To this day, the psychiatric OPD at Hospicio hospital Margao is seeing Covid recoverees return with anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress. There are those who get flashbacks of the time they were in hospital, and recall the days of feeling breathless with trepidation. These include healthcare workers who also got infected and unknowingly infected their family members. “They were not able to deal with day-to-day life because of the anxiety,” a psychiatrist at the OPD said. “One healthcare worker could resume work only after two months and feared returning and was afraid she would reinfect her family and suffer more health complications herself. She also felt like a culprit, transmitting Covid to them instead of protecting them,” she said. Initially healthcare workers were scared and unclear of the consequences. Now things have improved, but there are few who experience post-traumatic stress of the time they were isolated. “Few of them were so fearful of the consequences when they were infected and isolated that they had suicidal thoughts. For some this went away with counselling, but others required medication to be started for a short period. The anxiety has slowed down now,” the doctor said. The isolation coupled with lack of awareness of the disease and hype surrounding it added to the patients’ stress. “Isolation was one of the main causes of the deterioration of the mental health of patients,” says Dr Rita Vas, coordinator of the post-Covid clinic at Hospicio Hospital. “Initially, institutional quarantine meant they couldn’t meet their family and they had little information about the disease too. This created a panicky situation and their fear aggravated their inflammation. The psychosomatic symptoms originated because of mental hyperactivity, overthinking and analysing,” she said. “Several of the initial apprehensions and stigma disappeared slowly after home isolation was introduced,” she said. The post-Covid clinic, however, has had few people come back six and even nine months after recovery, with anxiety attacks, increased heart rate, insomnia and breathlessness where their health parameters are normal. “We find that the tests of some are normal, but they have sudden palpitations, a mixture of anxiety and depression and other psychosomatic stress reactions, which need to be attended to,” she said. The psychiatric OPD has been counselling those who suffered Covid as well as lost jobs and had their businesses affected during the pandemic. People who lost family members to Covid have been found struggling to cope even beyond the normal grieving period. “We have seen a rise in grief reaction cases. Some elderly have experienced depression and have required help when they couldn’t cope even beyond the grief period after losing a loved one to Covid,” the psychiatrist said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/traumatised-by-covid-19-isolations-recovered-persons-go-for-counselling/articleshow/81696441.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Lucknow||Shia Waqf Board elections: Majority members to be state govt nominee||AYODHYA: UP Shia Central Waqf Board that would be constituted on April 20 through an election process, will have majority members nominated by Uttar Pradesh government. Of 11 members of the Board, only two from the mutawalli quota are likely to be elected, while nine others will be government appointees as the electoral college has no Shia Muslim member of Parliament from Uttar Pradesh or Shia MLA in UP assembly. Same is the story in the UP Bar Council. As per the waqf rulebook, of 11 Board members, eight from different categories can be elected, including two from MP quota, two from MLA/MLC quota, two from Bar Council and two from mutawalli quota. The remaining three are nominated by the state government, which could include a religious scholar, social worker and a government officer of special secretary rank. In the current scenario, with no Shia Muslim MP from Uttar Pradesh either in Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha, the government would have to nominate two former MPs. And if not found, former members of state legislative bodies could be nominated to fill this category, said, chief executive officer, Shia Waqf Board, Dr Naseer Hasan. Incidentally, Shia Union minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi is a Rajya Sabha member from Jharkhand. Since there are no MLAs from Shia community in this category too, the government could nominate a former legislator. However, there are two Shia MLCs in Uttar Pradesh assembly — Mohsin Raza and Buqqal Nawab. Raza being a cabinet minister holding the minorities department portfolio cannot run for membership, but Buqqal Nawab may sail through. In this scenario, the second member would be a government nominee if Buqqal decides to contest, said an observer. In UP Bar Council too, there is no member from Shia community so members for this category will also be nominated. Talking to TOI, Shia Waqf Board CEO Dr Naseer Hasan, said, “if there are no candidates from prescribed categories, then the state government can nominate to complete the quorum. The government can nominate any former MP or MLA from the Shia community to complete MP/MLA categories. Also, it can nominate lawyers from the community to complete the quorum in absence of Shia members in Bar Council. Besides the eight, three members would be from the state government quota as per the Waqf Act.” Can former chairman of Shia Waqf Board Waseem Rizvi contest the election? Talking to TOI, Ashfaq Hussain Zia, former member of Shia Waqf Board, said, “If he tries to contest, no one will vote for him as he has been disowned by the community. The state government too won’t support him.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/majority-members-will-be-state-govt-nominees/articleshow/81696439.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan
---||Pune||Flyers allege laxity in checks of RT-PCR reports at Pune airport||Pune: Kapil Makkar (35), who recently flew from Delhi to Pune on a direct flight, feels that spending money to get the mandatory RT-PCR test for flyers from some states is useless.According to Makkar. the couple of times he travelled — last on March 14 — no one at the Pune airport cared to ask for the report; he simply walked out. “After landing at the airport, we were told to form a queue, but soon got mixed with passengers from other states near the baggage belts. As I passed through the arrival gate outside the airport, no one asked me for the report. This has happened with me twice,” Makkar, who works in Pune, said.As per regulations, passengers traveling on direct flights from Delhi, Goa, Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Kerala to Maharashtra need to carry a negative RT-PCR negative report. If they don’t have a report, they must take the test at the airport before being allowed to leave.A passenger — on the condition of anonymity — claimed the officials at the airport don’t check the reports carefully. The passenger said when he came to Pune from Delhi last month, he got away with showing his relative’s report.“I couldn’t get my report on time and so showed a report of my relative, who was traveling with me. I had the report on my phone — they just saw the negative result and let me pass. There are people near the arrival gate to check reports, but they don’t seem thorough,” he said.On weekdays, there are 11 direct flights from Pune to Delhi and one each from Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Kerala.Pune airport director Kuldeep Singh said those involved in checking reports have been told to be alert and said the instances pointed out by passengers were rare occurrences. “The reports of the passengers coming from these states are checked meticulously. Apart from staff from the private diagnostic centre, PMC officials too help,” he told TOI.A PMC official said those without RT-PCR negative reports were not being allowed to board flights from these states, a claim rebuffed by passengers. “Airlines ask whether we carry the report, but don’t check. Further, the Pune airport has a testing facility, so there is no question of not allowing passengers to not board,” Makkar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/flyers-allege-laxity-in-checks-of-rt-pcr-reports-at-pune-airport/articleshow/81694957.cms||Joy Sengupta

The Boeing B737 aircraft that flew in was a passenger aircraft but the airline used it as a cargo flight, shipping in electronic goods and flying out with live mud crabs. “The CEA flight touched down at Kolkata around 4.30pm on Wednesday. It carried in its belly around 8 tonne of electronics items. The plane flew out around four hours later with 3 tonne live mud crabs,” an airport official said. While the quantum of cargo isn’t too impressive given than passenger aircraft can carry 9-10 tonne of cargo in their belly-hold, it has piqued the interest of the travel trade community as it marks the return of one of the first airlines to take flight after the Covid outbreak in China last Febraury. Though Cathay Pacific that operated between Kolkata and Hong Kong was still in operation, the ‘temporary’ withdrawal of the CEA flight from February 10, 2020, had marked the severing of air ties between Kolkata and mainland China. Four days prior to that, IndiGo had cancelled its flights to China. At the time CEA stopped operation, no one had a clue about a pandemic and how the industry was set to dive into a tailspin. The airline that flew to Kunming from Kolkata had announced that it would re-assess the situation on February 29. But things had worsened thereafter and with lockdown being announced from the third week of March, international travel was severely hit. But the return of CEA has spread hope among the travel trade community. Though India is bracing for a second wave of Covid-19 infections, travel agents hoped the return of CEA, alongside mass vaccination in India, would herald a revival of international travel post vaccination. “CEA is also opening its office in Kolkata once a week every Tuesday. Though there are no indications of when passenger flight services will resume, we are hoping it will start some time later this year if the Covid-19 situation is in control,” Travel Agents Federation of India eastern region chairman Anil Punjabi said. On Tuesday, a day before the arrival of the CEA flight, the director-general of civil aviation extended the suspension of international flights in India till April 30. This though, is not applicable to flights that are already approved by the authorities. International flights were suspended in March 2020, after a nationwide lockdown was imposed in view of the Covid-19 pandemic breakout. In May 2020, the government launched the Vande Bharat Mission to evacuate Indian stranded abroad. The mission currently is in its tenth phase. In addition, bubble flights have been introduced between India and 27 countries. China does not figure among them yet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/travel-hopes-soar-with-chinese-flights-return-to-kolkata-sky/articleshow/81694966.cms||Subhro Niyogi

For every 1,000 positive cases detected, 14 succumb to the disease, he said. “Goa detects around 100 positive cases in a day and the virus claims one or two people from among these. On September 16, 2020, Goa saw over 600 positive cases and in the next two-three days, we recorded around seven-eight deaths in a day. So the mortality rate is around 1.4 % of detected positive cases. Even after six months, the rate remains unchanged,” Ghodkirekar said. Pointing out to the appeal made by the health department to not lower one’s guard in the wake of the rising number of Covid-19 cases in the state, Ghodkirekar said, “Just forget about any first, second or third wave. Soon, Goa will cross 1,000 deaths since the first Covid-19 death was reported in the state. So long as we get Covid-19 positive cases, the current pattern of mortality rate among detected positive cases is likely to remain unaltered,” he said. Health minister Vishwajit Rane had recently appealed to the people to strictly adhere to Covid-19 norms of maintaining social distancing and wearing masks||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/14-deaths-for-every-1000-covid-cases-is-worrying/articleshow/81696431.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Police are waiting for the woman, who works in a bar, to gain consciousness to record her statement. “Shobhraj R was involved with the woman for two years and they used to meet in hotels. It is learnt that she used to often ask him for money,” said a police officer, adding that Shobhraj had spent at least Rs 1 crore on her. “The frequent demands might have angered Shobhraj and he must have planned to kill her.

---||Chandigarh||Land acquisition: Farmers break barricades, block road in Patiala||Patiala: A number of farmers under Delhi Katra Expressway Kisan Sangharsh Committee (DKEKSC) on Thursday broke the police barricade in Patiala and entered the city to stage a protest near the chief minister’s residence. After crossing the barricades, the farmers reached YPS Chowk in the city, where they staged a protest. On Wednesday, police stopped the farmers near Bhakhra Canal at Pasiana of Patiala after they announced their plan to protest near the CM’s residence against the state government’s failure to pay heed to their demands, including that of halting land acquisition for Delhi-Amritsar-Katra expressway national highway. Police barricaded the area on Wednesday, following which protesting farmers blocked the road with their tractor-trolleys. They spent the night on the road. These farmers have been protesting against the state government for almost four months, demanding to get acquisition proceedings halted till the issue of the three farm laws was resolved. Also, the farmers are not satisfied with the compensation being awarded by the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) for their fertile land to be used for the expressway. “We broke the police barricading and reached YPS Chowk, where we earlier announced to stage protest. We did not land in any clash with the police. Police had installed barricades at YPS Chowk to prevent us from reaching the CM house. We will intensify the agitation from Saturday. The government, instead of meeting our demands, has sped up proceedings for acquisition. There is no difference between the Congress government in Punjab and BJP government at the Centre as the Punjab government is working on the instructions of the central government and getting acquired farmers’ land for a lower price,” alleged Harmanpreet Singh Jeji, coordinator, (DKEKSC). He added, “When farmers initiated Delhi Chalo protest against the three farm laws on November 26, they were not allowed to move their vehicles on these national highways. The central government only wants to take over farmers’ land either through corporates or in the name of projects and national highways.” He said only 10 farmers from each affected district had reached the protest site. DSP Samana said no case was registered against the protesting farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/land-acquisition-farmers-break-barricades-block-road-in-patiala/articleshow/81695716.cms||---
---||Delhi||Ensure no untreated sewage is released in the drains, says DPCC||New Delhi: After noticing formation of froth in the Yamuna, DPCC has written to Haryana and Uttar Pradesh governments asking them to upgrade sewage treatment plants, treat sewage and remove water hyacinth from pondage of Okhla Barrage. According to DPCC, foam formation in the Yamuna was due to the presence of phosphates, surfactants and untreated sewage. In a letter to the principal secretary, irrigation department, UP, and chairperson of UP Pollution Control Board, DPCC said: “Hindon cut canal carrying waste from UP discharges into the Yamuna at upstream of Okhla Barrage. This canal carries pollutants, which enters Hindon river from the paper and sugar mills, along with Saharanpur, Muzaffarnagar, Shamli & Meerut. The canal then enters Hindon cut canal at Indra Kunj, which flows into the Okhla barrage. Direct the concerned departments to take necessary action for upgradation of STPs and treatment of sewage or wastewater to meet the standards of Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) with bio-nutrient removal.” Reiterating that UP irrigation department maintained the Okhla barrage, DPCC said it has found large amount of water hyacinth growth on the pondage of the barrage, which needed to be cleared, as the dying weeds continuously released surfactants. DPCC wrote to chairman of Haryana State Pollution Control Board and said, “Untreated sewage from Haryana is entering Delhi from Sonipat, Gurgaon and Badshahpur drains and falling into Najafgarh drain.” Haryana government was directed to ensure there was no discharge of untreated sewage into the Yamuna. DPCC asked the officials from both the states to take necessary action and send the action taken report to its office urgently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ensure-no-untreated-sewage-is-released-in-the-drains-says-dpcc/articleshow/81696443.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

The boat, along with two other fishing trawlers, were tracked and intercepted by offshore patrol vessels and air assets, including some from Goa. The crew of the three fishing vessels have been detained and brought to Kerala for further investigation. Coast Guard sources said that based on the intelligence gained and the inputs gleaned during the interrogation, the operation to crackdown on similar drug running boats is on. “On March 15, intelligence inputs were received regarding a suspicious boat of foreign origin likely to be engaged in drug trafficking in the Arabian Sea. On receipt and corroboration of input, a swift air-sea coordinated operation by Indian Coast Guard was launched immediately to detect the suspicious boats,” the Coast Guard said in a statement. The past one year has proved to be a big setback for drug traffickers at sea as ICG has successfully seized about 1.6 tonnes of narcotics worth Rs 4,900 crore. The total drug haul done by ICG since inception amounts to Rs 10,952 crore. The Coast Guard has deployed offshore patrol ships and maritime surveillance aircraft to conduct extensive search operations around the Lakshadweep islands. On March 18, patrolling ICG units detected the three suspicious boats off Minicoy islands and intercepted them. “Post boarding, interrogation of crew revealed inconsistent statements. On rummaging of boats, high grade 300 kg heroin and 5 AK-47 rifles with 1,000 live rounds were recovered from Sri Lankan fishing boat Ravihansi. The estimated value of narcotics in the international market is approximately Rs 3,000 crore,” said the Coast Guard in a statement. All the three boats along with 19 crew were escorted to Vizhinjam, Kerala for joint investigation. On March 5, ICG ships and aircraft, in a coordinated operation in Lakshadweep seas, had successfully apprehended Sri Lankan boat Akarsha Duwa with six crew off Minicoy island. The crew had admitted to carrying 200 kg high grade heroin and 60 kg hashish which were jettisoned at sea on sighting of ICG ships on patrol. In November 2020, ICG had apprehended Sri Lankan boat Shenaya Duwa off Kanyakumari, carrying 120 kg narcotics worth Rs 1,000 crore and five weapons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/coast-guard-seizes-lankan-boat-with-arms-rs-3k-cr-drugs/articleshow/81696448.cms||---

Reports released by realty consultants JLL and Anarock said other markets across the country too were rallying, and attributed the increase in sales — especially in Pune and Mumbai — to stamp duty and premium rebates by the state government and a 10-year-low interest rate on home loans. Real estate consultancy Knight Frank, in its report, observed that 12,696 properties were registered in Mumbai between March 1 and 24. This implied a daily average of 529 units, over four times higher than in March 2020. The Knight Frank report added that the increase in registrations was not affected by the 3% cut in stamp duty being revised to 2% in January this year. Players in Pune’s real estate sectors reported a similar rush in registrations in the days leading up to March 31, when the stamp duty concession would expire. Shishir Baijal, chairman and managing director of Knight Frank, said, “As the economy revived in the first quarter of this calendar year, it boosted sales. The euphoria among homebuyers continued despite the 1% increase in stamp duty rates. A combination of lowest home loan rates, reduced prices, rebates, and payment flexibility, as well as increased household savings, have provided the right growth environment,” Per JLL, the nationwide market recorded a 93% recovery in the first quarter of 2021 compared to Q1 2020. Pune’s recovery has been marginally higher than 100%, while Mumbai recovered slower, at 84%. Other cities — Kolkata, Hyderabad, Delhi NCR, and Chennai — recovered better, but Mumbai topped absolute sales numbers. Samantak Das, chief economist of JLL, also attributed the increase to the aforementioned factors, and said, “The easing of lockdown restrictions and the start of the vaccination drive have further helped bringing buyers back to the market.” Anarock stated that most of the sales were driven by the mid-segment, followed by the affordable segment, Anarock noted in its report. “The Mumbai and Pune regions were the most active this quarter as the stamp duty cuts and other sops and discounts substantially reduced acquisition cost,” Anuj Puri, chairman of Anarock, said. “Apart from stable property prices, the circular by the state government that the reduced stamp duty rate can be paid now, with deferred registration, is also helping drive up sales,” Vineet Goyal, MD of Kohinoor Group, said. Conversely, Credai-Pune Metro president Suhas Merchant said, “Sales may decline from April to June, along with the decline that the monsoon generally brings to home sales. We urge the state government to retain the stamp duty cut.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pune-home-sales-exceed-pre-covid-levels-this-quarter/articleshow/81694976.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

FCI had directed businessmen to blend 1% fortified rice into custom milled rice. The compromise was struck after a series of meetings between Rashtriya Sheller Sangh representatives with FCI officials, Centre and state governments. Rice supply had been halted after FCI issued directions to blend fortified rice with custom milled rice. Millers maintained that they did not have adequate infrastructure to do this and neither did they have any agreement with the state government. The FCI, on Thursday, issued a letter to all stakeholders, including Punjab government, saying, “It has been decided to resume CMR (custom milled rice) receipt operations in Punjab as millers have started delivery of fortified rice and government of Punjab has given a tentative schedule for supply of fortified rice.” Rohit Aggarwal, president, Rashtriya Sheller Sangh said, “To fulfil the requirements of the pilot project of the Prime Minister, millers of Punjab agreed to supply fortified rice for better nutrition of the poor and supplies started from today. The rice millers of Punjab were in deep trouble with the stalling of acceptance of custom milled rice by the FCI for the last 25 days. The reason being midway course correction by the Centre government for supply of fortified rice to improve the nutritional value of rice supplied under PDS throughout India.” Aggarwal added, “Since there was unavailability of blending machines and no agreement between the millers and the state government on fortified rice kernels and bardana, 4,500 rice mills came to a grinding halt, affecting the livelihood of millers, labourers and the allied industry.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/rice-procurement-in-pb-resumes-after-25-days/articleshow/81695721.cms||Mohit Behl

Singh had denied the allegations. Dange, who was suspended last July for allegedly naming a person in an FIR without sufficient grounds, said he will be joining duty on Friday at south region control room. “I have been cleared of the baseless charges levelled against me and reinstated back in service with full honor,” Dange said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cop-who-sought-inquiry-against-ex-cp-reinstated/articleshow/81695745.cms||---

---||Ranchi||Plummeting death rate in East Singhbhum comes as silver lining amid Covid surge||JAMSHEDPUR: With 18,550 cases till date, East Singhbhum, along with Ranchi, shares the bulk of Covid-19 infections in Jharkhand at the moment but the number of deaths, which was at an all-time high, has come down this year. Though the total number of Covid deaths stands at 375 (as of Thursday morning), in the past 108 days only two casualties – one on December 7 and the other on January 16 – have taken place. Out of the 375 deaths — reported between July 4 and January 16 — 255 were senior citizens, 86 were in the age group of 45-59, 29 in 30-44 years and five were in the age group of 15-29. The mortality rate, which was 2.2% in December, is now 2.02%. Asked what helped in East Singhbhum from being one of worst-affected districts in terms of casualty figures to a region which is setting examples for others, experts attributed it to multiple factors, including timely admission of symptomatic patients and general awareness among people regarding the disease. “Several factors have contributed in curbing the number of deaths, including taking adequate care of those with co-morbidities,” East Singhbhum’s additional chief medical officer Sahir Pall said. Tata Main Hospital (TMH), which accounted for over 90% of the deaths, introduced new drugs to treat the critical patients. “From September, we brought into use Ivermeclin, Doxycycline, Tocuzumab, along with Remdesivir and Favipiravir, for our critical patients and this proved beneficial in averting deaths,” TMH’s advisor of medical services Rajan Chaudhary said, adding, “Increasing the number of ventilator beds to more than 100 also helped.” He said that speeding up RT-PCR tests also helped in identifying the critically patients and administering the new drugs to them accordingly. “Awareness regarding safety norms among the elderly people also helped to an extent in preventing the spread of the disease and this eventually reduced the number of deaths,” he added. Indian Medical Association president (Jamshedpur unit) Umesh Khan said the availability of necessary medicines at the leading Covid care centres proved immensely beneficial in checking the number of casualties. “In mid-September, some leading hospitals replaced the medicines which were meant for the critical patients after some of them complained of respiratory problems. This timely action prevented the number of deaths from going up,” he added. Psychiatrist Dr Mahesh Hembram, however, said the number of deaths have reduced substantially but he isn’t sure how far the medicines have contributed to that. “Covid-related deaths are fortunately low now but I am not sure how far the medicines have been effective in achieving this,” he said. He added there is not much change in people’s behaviour as far as maintaining safety norms is concerned. “Most of them have flouted the norms when the casualty figure was at its peak from June to September,” he claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/plummeting-death-rate-in-e-sbhum-comes-as-silver-lining-amid-cov-surge/articleshow/81695008.cms||B Sridhar

They have also arrested five persons in this connection. The statues, which date back to 900 and 1000 BC, were among a dozen ancient idols found by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) during an excavation in Baharanpur under Mufassil police station of Hazaribag last month. In the intervening night of March 20 and 21, two idols got stolen from the site. Announcing the news at a press conference, SP Kathik S said, “Five persons aged between 40 and 50 were held from Ranchi and Bihar for stealing the idols. We have also recovered the idol from a house in Ranchi.” The idols were recovered from the residence of one Sanjay Agarwal (49) of Kokar Chunabhatta under Sadar police station in Ranchi. Police later arrested Kumar Sujit Singh (46) from Banka in Bihar. Based on the confessions of Agarwal and Singh, police nabbed three others from different places in Bihar. “Sanjay was the gang leader and he masterminded the theft,” the SP said. The SP said that the gang first visited the excavation site in Hazaribag on March 3 after learning about the idols through newspapers. “Later, the gang again visited the place on three occasions — March 12, 13 and 14 — to conduct a recce. Finally, on the intervening night of March 20 and 21, they succeeded in stealing the idols,” he said, adding that they carried the idols on two-wheelers and later took a bus to Ranchi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/buddha-idols-stolen-from-hbag-recovered-from-ranchi-5-held/articleshow/81695024.cms||---
---||Ranchi||‘2nd wave of pandemic has started, recent surge not temporary blip’||RANCHI: With Jharkhand recording its highest positivity rate in this calendar year on Wednesday and the rolling average of daily cases soaring by 100% in a just one week, experts here claimed that the state is witnessing the beginning of a second wave of Covid-19 and the numbers are not a minor or temporary blip in the downward trend in new infections since October. Jharkhand had 969 active Covid cases as of Wednesday night, of which more than 55% were added in the last month. On Wednesday, the state recorded 194 new cases, the biggest one-day jump since January 9. Of these, 93 were in Ranchi (highest since January 9), 34 in East Singhbhum (highest in this calendar year) and 13 in Sahebganj (highest since October 19). Notably, Sahebganj, which also recorded 12 cases on Tuesday, had become Covid-free for a brief period last month. While officials in the state government and the health department did not respond to TOI’s call and messages, healthcare experts said the surging numbers speak for themselves and the state has entered the second wave of the pandemic. They added that the number of infections in the state will start peaking in mid-April and start falling only by the end of May. Talking to TOI, Dr Devesh Kumar, professor of community medicine at Rajendra Institute Of Medical Sciences (Rims), Ranchi, said: “The second wave is at the door of Jharkhand and it is obvious from the spike reported in last one week. Last year also we recorded a surge in Covid cases about 45 days after the numbers soared in bigger and more connected states like Maharashtra and Gujarat.” Kumar added: “As per the current trends, we are expecting the number of new infections to start peaking around April 15 and a receding trend is likely to be visible by the end of May. Having said that, if highly-infectious new mutant strains or variants from the UK or South African start circulating in Jharkhand, it will increase our problems as we do not know much about the severity of the disease they can cause.” Dr Pradeep Bhattacharya, professor of critical care and head of trauma centre at Rims, said he had always been apprehensive about a second wave and his predictions seem to be coming true. “This is a second wave. I have experienced a similar situation during the swine flu outbreak in 2009 as cases kept popping up even after more than four-five months of zero infections. As the numbers have increased, I am planning on opening up a second ICU for Covid patients at the trauma centre as the first with 14 beds are completely occupied.” TOI sent the numbers compiled with the help of state government daily Covid bulletin and presented it to health secretary K K Soan. However, he did not comment on the figures even after several attempts were made to contact him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/2nd-wave-of-pandemic-has-started-recent-surge-not-temporary-blip/articleshow/81695091.cms||Gaurav Pandey

---||Ranchi||Jharkhand to start genome sequencing of +ve samples||RANCHI: The state health department has decided to start genome sequencing of preserved positive Covid-19 samples. The state government is also working on modalities to install a sequencer machine that will be used for genome sequencing at the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences in Ranchi. A letter was issued by the director of the state unit of National Health Mission (NHM), Ravishankar Shukla, on Wednesday evening directing the in-charges of all government-run RT-PCR labs to send 5% of their total positive samples to the Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), Bhubaneswar for genome sequencing. The samples to be sent for genome sequencing must have tested positive between January 1 and March 23 this year. In view of the above directions, the microbiology department of Rims is dispatching 50 stored samples for testing to Bhubaneswar and the consignment will be released by Thursday evening. Talking to TOI, state epidemiologist Dr Praveen Karn said: “As per GOI protocols, we will send the preserved samples to ascertain if any mutant strain is present in our state. The RNA samples as well as VTM aliquots will be properly stored in a deep freezer (preferably -80°C) and the cold chain will be maintained during the transfer of samples to ILS Bhubaneswar.” Asked when Jharkhand will get testing infrastructure for genome surveillance, Dr Karn said that a proposal has been made to procure a sequencer machine that is used for genome surveillance. According to sources in the health department, a proposal for purchasing a sequencer machine was submitted to the health department in the month of February but there has been no development on the front since then. “The cost of a sequencer machine is around 1.5 crore, so approvals from multiple levels are required before purchasing it. After we receive the machine, we will be able to determine the type of strain that is currently active and is infecting people,” a senior official of the health department said. Dr Karn further said: “ILS, Bhubaneswar directly informs the Union government about the results and we will, in turn, receive the information from the Union ministry of health and family welfare. I cannot provide a timeline for the same.” However, Karn said that the samples once collected are supposed to reach the testing centres within 48 hours of collection and special courier services have been arranged for that for Rims. MGM Jamshedpur has also started work on the process and they, too, will start sending the samples soon for testing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jharkhand-to-start-genome-sequencing-of-ve-samples/articleshow/81694712.cms||Gaurav Pandey

Hassan, the elder son of former MLA Haji Hussain Ansari, filed his nomination in two sets around 2pm. His candidature was backed by JMM’s coalition partners Congress and RJD. Speaking to TOI over phone after filing his papers, Hassan said: “My objective will be to carry forward my father’s legacy and ensuring holistic development of Madhupur and its people.” Ansari, a close associate of JMM patriarch Shibu Soren, died of post-Covid complications at a private hospital in Ranchi in October. JMM inducted Hassan into the state cabinet in February this year in a ceremony convened in short notice at Raj Bhavan. The move was seen as a bid to quell dissent within JMM ranks in Deoghar district. Hassan was handed over the portfolios of tourism and sports, arts, culture and youth affairs. Before Hassan filed his papers, the district unit of JMM organized a public meeting at Madhupur’s Aam Bagaan ground. The meeting was attended by chief minister Hemant Soren, rural affairs minister Alamgir Alam, agriculture minister Badal Patralekh, labour minister Satyanand Bhokta and Congress MLAs Deepika Pandey Singh, Irfan Ansari and Pradeep Yadav. Soren arrived in Deoghar in a private chopper rented to ferry him to Assam for addressing election rallies as a star campaigner for Congress candidates. Whipping up sentiments of the late JMM stalwart Ansari, Soren said: “Ensuring Hassan’s victory will be a real tribute to Haji Sahab. Hassan’s victory will also strengthen the government.” Alam told TOI: “Like Dumka and Bermo bypolls last year, the Mahagatbandhan candidate will win handsomely in Madhupur and will retain Haji Sahab’s seat.” While Hassan filed his papers, BJP is yet to announce its candidate for the seat. Earlier this week, the saffron party inducted Ajsu Party’s 2019 election candidate Gang Narayan Singh in its ranks, sending a strong indication that he is in contention for the race along with former labour minister Raj Paliwar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jmms-hafizul-files-papers-for-madhupur/articleshow/81694620.cms||Dhritiman Ray

He added that BJP’s divisive politics in the name of CAA among others won’t reap it the desired results vis-à-vis development centric agendas mooted by the Congress, if voted to power. Party spokesperson Alok Dubey, who accompanied Oraon on Assam tour, state that a battery of leaders from Jharkhand Congress is sweating it out on the poll turfs both in Bengal and Assam to ensure that their candidates win. Specially on Bengal, he said, “While pundits have pitted the elections as TMC vs BJP, but the Congress-Left combine will pop up surprising results.” Meanwhile, on the last day of campaigning for the first phase of elections, state health minister Banna Gupta, Ramgarh MLA Mamta Devi among others, held door to door campaigning in Bagmundi and Jaipur constituencies in Purulia district in favour of party candidates. While Congress is part of ruling alliance in Jharkhand with JMM and RJD, it is pitted against the two in Bengal after both the parties extended support to Mamata Banerjee led TMC.

Two such cases were reported in Vijayawada commissionerate limits recently. According to cybercrime police, a village volunteer first received a phone call from a man claiming to be speaking from the state secretariat. He asked if all beneficiaries were receiving money for Amma Vodi and other schemes. At this point, the volunteer said that one student had not received the money. The conman caller asked the village volunteer to take the student’s father on conference call. The conman reportedly told the father that a processing fee had to be paid to receive money under the scheme. The father first transferred Rs 4,000 and then Rs 9,000. Upon calling the number again, the father found that it was switched off and realised that he had been deceived. He lodged a complaint at Gannavaram police station on March 20. In another incident, a cyber conman attempted to gather information on beneficiaries of schemes from village secretariat officials. According to cybercrime sleuths, the modus operandi of cybercriminals was largely uniform across the globe until a few years ago. But now, conmen are localising their targets and designing state-specific strategy. In case of Andhra Pradesh, they are exploiting the desperation of people awaiting money under welfare schemes. “Complaints are coming from people of poor backgrounds. In the first case, since the village volunteer took him into conference, the victim gave the details without hesitation,” said a senior city police official. Police appealed to the people to not give out personal information such as Aadhaar and bank account number or transfer any money under the guise of ‘processing fee’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/cyber-criminals-target-govt-scheme-beneficiaries-in-ap/articleshow/81694144.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

The SEC took the decision after TDP candidate M Vijaya Lakshmi lodged a complaint that her nomination was withdrawn without her notice by an unknown election agent, whom she never appointed. The case was registered with Tirupati police and election authorities also started an enquiry. The matter came up for hearing before the high court’s single judge bench of Justice DVSS Somayajulu. Sujatha’s counsel VRN Prasanth told the court that the complaint was initially filed against the returning officer and there was no mention of any accused in the FIR, but later Lakshmi intentionally claimed someone had forged her signature. He further argued that the SEC cannot suspend the election process as the investigation was done by the police and the matter should be heard by the election tribunal and court. Ashwani Kumar, the counsel for SEC, said the purity of electoral process has to be preserved by the SEC. The court, after hearing both sides, upheld the SEC’s decision and dismissed the petition. It also directed the SEC to complete the investigation process at the earliest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/high-court-upholds-secs-order-to-suspend-tirupati-ward-7-polls/articleshow/81694159.cms||Venu Lanka

The defeated candidates are blaming key leaders for the drubbing. Former deputy mayor Gogula Ramana Rao blamed top leaders for his defeat. It is alleged that Gogula Ramana Rao, a BC leader, was denied ticket by local constituency in-charge Bonda Uma. He however managed to get B-form from the TDP high command and contested as rebel. Ramana Rao alleged that Bonda Uma and other leaders supported YSRC in the municipal elections. “TDP is a party of backward castes. Our party chief N Chandrababu Naidu directed local party units to give a chance to sitting BC candidates but Bonda Uma denied ticket to me and his family members campaigned in favour of my opponents which is not acceptable,” Ramana Rao said. “We are confident that the party would have won majority of seats in Vijayawada but Bonda Uma spoiled the chances with one press conference making baseless allegations against MP Kesineni Nani,” Ramana Rao said. TDP is known for its discipline but leaders like Bonda Uma are ruining the party for personal benefits, he said. Bonda Uma’s supporters demanded an apology from Ramana Rao. They alleged that corruption was the main reason for his defeat.

The project was delayed first fue to court restraints and later the pandemic. “Clause 5.9 of the Concession Agreement envisages obligations relating to employment of people of Goa and displaced family. Around 1,500 jobs are expected to be available for Goans once the airport becomes operational. Government has already approved the setting up of the Aviation Skill Development Centre by the Concessionaire at the airport site to impart skills/training to Goans unemployed youth to become eligible for such jobs,’’ Sawant said. The estimated cost of the project is Rs 1,900 core, but delay has increased the cost, the chief minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sawant-mopa-airport-to-be-commissioned-by-aug-2022/articleshow/81678001.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Nagpur University exam Day 1: Tech glitches keep students on tenterhooks||NAGPUR: It was on the cards ever since Nagpur University shifted its winter-2020 examination from app to web-link based. On Thursday afternoon, technical glitches and server errors forced NU to cancel all the papers scheduled for the day but later the university claimed it managed to hold papers for 5,000 students in the evening after fixing the bug. About 10,000 students were supposed to appear for the exams on Thursday. On October 8 last year, when students appeared for the first paper of summer-2020 exams, they too faced similar problems as the system failed to send OTP on their smartphones after login, thus forcing a majority of them to miss the exams. TOI had on Thursday reported about students and teachers complaining about web-link based exams stating that they weren’t familiar with it and it also requires high speed internet connectivity, which is extremely difficult in rural and some remote areas of the city. Vice-chancellor Subhash Chaudhari told TOI in the afternoon that when he reviewed the situation, he found that one after another technical problems are cropping up. “We also came to know that the server wasn’t properly configured and students were facing numerous software glitches. Therefore, I directed the Examination Section officials to cancel today’s papers to avoid further confusion,” he said. Chaudhari clarified that the papers would be rescheduled midway during the exam schedule or after the end of the papers. However, in the evening, the VC called TOI informing that NU had fixed the technical bug in its servers and over 5,000 students had successfully logged in and solved the papers till 8pm. “As we had kept the system open, students tried to login and they are solving the papers right now. We have received confirmation of about 5,000 examinees in the system. We will think about whether to grant another chance to them, as they had successfully logged in and many have also submitted their papers. As the system has been shifted from app to web-based link, we need to change a lot of features,” said the VC. The papers of BSc, BCom and BBA fifth semester were scheduled in the first shift from 8am to 9am, BE seventh and BSc (Home Sci) fifth semesters were slotted from 9am to 10am, and BA and BA LLB fifth semesters from 10am to 11am. However, the problems started cropping up from the first paper in the morning. In the morning when TOI called Board of Examination and Evaluation (BOEE) director Prafulla Sable after receiving numerous complaints from the aggrieved students and their parents, the latter said only a few were facing problems due to poor connectivity issues. “We had already made it clear to the examinees that they would need 5 MBPS speed for desktops, laptops and tablets and 1 MBPS for mobile,” said Sable. Endorsing Sable, the VC told TOI in the afternoon that reexam would be held for students those who couldn’t appear in the papers. Both he and Sable categorically had denied any chances of cancelling the exams in the morning hours. However, after complaints started jumping, a decision to cancel the entire set of Thursday’s paper was taken in the afternoon. # Flip-flop on Thursday * NU started online papers on mobiles, desktops, laptops & tablets at 8am * Students started facing difficulties right from login to accessing questions * A majority of them were unable to open papers, as system showed errors * Some managed to login but the system hanged after few answers * Few complained about receiving total blank screen after repeated login attempts * Initially, BoEE director Prafulla Sable & VC said servers didn’t crash * They denied plans to cancel exam, said very few are facing difficulties * With complaints pouring in, VC decided to cancel all Thursday’s papers * VC decided to reschedule them midway or at end * BoEE director issued notification about cancellation * Blamed server configuration and other technical bugs for clogging system * By 6pm, Promarc technicians managed to clear the bug in the system * NU claims about 5K students successfully logged in and solved papers till 8pm||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nu-exam-day-1-tech-glitches-keep-students-on-tenterhooks/articleshow/81694279.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Nagpur||After 3 years, Nagpur Flying Club takes wing for a 2nd time||NAGPUR: After prodding from the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court, Nagpur Flying Club (NFC) restarted flying activities from Thursday by successfully flying its three of the four aircraft. The British Era club was closed for the last three-and-a-half years due to the Maharashtra government’s apathy. It was reopened in 2008 again after HC’s directives after being defunct for over 14 years. On Thursday, three NFC’s refurbished aircraft were towed out of its hangar for flying from the Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Airport after a long gap and were successfully test flown. The fourth one would be tested soon. The team from Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) will now inspect the facilities and test all aircraft before granting approval for restarting its full-fledged operations, including training aspirants for Private Pilot License (PPL) and Commercial Private License (CPL). “Our entire team has worked very hard for restarting flying activities. Since all four were old aircraft, it was hard to make them ready for flying and seek permissions from the DGCA in this regard. Now, after today’s successful flying, we can restart all activities at the prestigious club shortly. We’re waiting for the DGCA panel’s visit,” said an elated divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar, NFC’s ex-officio chairman. NFC’s maintenance-cum-accountable manager Pragnesh Sisodia said all three aircraft were flown for one hour each and everything was perfect. “We had taken help from Capt Sunil Singh, who’s a freelance pilot, as we’re yet to get DGCA’s approval for flying by our pilots, including the newly appointed deputy chief flying instructor (CFI) Capt Azil. Singh checked all instruments of three aircraft on whether they’re properly working. Now, DGCA team would check their air-worthiness, along with NFC’s documentation,” he told TOI. On January 30, Kumar filed a detailed affidavit in HC informing about efforts being made to resume training from May 8. It was filed in response to a PIL (No13/2016) originally filed by Flt Lt Shridhar Ghatate through counsel Shriniwas Deshpande and now pursued by his wife Sumedha after the club stopped operating. The commissioner clarified that NFC would be needing approvals from the DGCA offices in Mumbai and Delhi, Aero-Club of India, Wireless and Telecommunication (Wireless Planning and Coordination) Authority in New Delhi and Mumbai, and Airport Authority of India (AAI) here for restarting its operations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/after-3-yrs-nagpur-flying-club-takes-wing-for-a-2nd-time/articleshow/81694310.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) will have 102 such teams in action. While officials hold that beds — both free and paid — are available in the city for Covid-19patients, these have been filling up at an alarming rate. As a consequence, the administration has had to increase the hospitalisation capacity significantly. Hospitals have already been advised to stay away from planned surgeries that can be delayed and those hospitals that did not register themselves as Covid-19 hospitals have been asked to do so at the earliest. Also, Covid-19 hospitals have been asked to not keep patients admitted for administering drugs like Ramdesivir and instead do so as a daycare procedure. To strengthen home-based Covid care, each of the 34 urban primary health centres (UHCs) in the city will have three teams per centre. These teams will have two members and will visit 20 home isolated patients a day, said officer on special duty for Covid-19 and education secretary Vinod Rao. Rao added that the teams will have necessary devices like pulse oximeters, BP instruments, thermal guns and others. The teams will prioritise patients as per their risk category. The patients will be monitored every day or every alternate day and will be mobilised to a hospital at the first instance of the need to do so. Wherever needed, telemedicine service will be integrated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/home-care-launched-as-hospitalizations-increase/articleshow/81694136.cms||---
---||India||How people dress, what they eat isn't netas' business: Irani||NEW DELHI: Women and child development minister Smriti Irani on Thursday said politicians have absolutely no business to talk about how people dress, what they eat and what they do as individuals. The minister said some things are "sacrosanct", like a woman's right to choose to live her life and engage with society the way she wants to, while responding to a discussion on the "ripped jeans" controversy. Irani's remarks came during a chat session titled 'Ladies who Lead' at Times Network India Economic Conclave. As part of the conversation, Irani was asked about Uttarakhand CM Tirath Singh Rawat's "women should not wear ripped jeans" remark which he sought to explain as a point on culture. Without naming Rawat, Irani said, "Irrespective of whether it is men, women or transgender [persons], politicians have absolutely no business talking about how people dress, what they eat and what they do, because ultimately our service is that of policymaking and ensuring rule of law." She said "there have been faux pas made by many a politician, both men and women", and then went on to point that with growing urgency, there has been a conversation that certain things are sacrosanct. "One of them is a woman's right to choose to live her life the way she wants to and engage with society as she deems fit... As long as you don't break the law, I have no business." Asked why she referred to Rawat's remarks as a "faux pas", Irani said, "Because no one in their enlightened mind would make that statement." Sharing her perception about her assignment as WCD minister, Irani said "for a prime minister who says his main political agenda is women-led development, this is the best service you can give in the best ministry in office". She said this in response to a question that the ministry did not do justice to her profile and that she deserved a more important berth after a win in Amethi, where she was declared a "giant killer" after defeating Rahul Gandhi. Irani, without naming Rahul, quipped, "He was hardly a giant." Regarding Congress's prospects in West Bengal, she said, "Politically, Congress knows that in WB, they have absolutely no gains to be made. It speaks volumes about their leadership that they did not stand in support of their own workers and their own ecosystem." She said for the "first time in West Bengal, Congress, by its very demeanour and leadership, has accepted defeat even before the first vote is cast".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/how-people-dress-what-they-eat-isnt-netas-business-irani/articleshow/81698345.cms||---
---||Goa||Doubts raised over Goa mining corporation as no mention of financial provision||PORVORIM: The House on Thursday saw a few members expressing their doubts over chief minister Pramod Sawant’s announcement of restarting mining activities through the setting up of a Goa Mining Corporation. Former chief minister and Congress legislator Pratapsingh Rane questioned the state government’s intent to restart mining operations and asked Sawant to provide the House with a detailed explanation on what is being done to achieve this and provide employment to the 40,000-odd people employed by the mining firms. Rane said that the state could not point fingers at the Centre. “We cannot pass the buck saying that it is a central subject because it is a major mineral. This is not the way. It affects the local people and it affects the economy of Goa,” said Rane, while speaking during the general discussion on the state budget. Porvorim MLA Rohan Khaunte said that while Sawant has announced the setting up of a mining corporation he has made no mention of “budget head” and “financial provision” in his budget speech. When the Goa Industrial Development Corporation Act is being amended to find a player to run the coal block, why did the government not take the same route, Khaunte said. Benaulim MLA Churchill Alemao said that forming of a mining corporation is a good decision. He, however, added that the government should not revert it later .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/doubts-raised-over-mining-corp-as-no-mention-of-financial-provision/articleshow/81695943.cms||---

The GFP MLA said since he (Sawant) has been chief minister for the past two years, he should take responsibility instead of recounting what transpired in the past. Sawant said orders have been issued for recovery of Rs 16 crore in 15 cases and trials are pending in other cases. The Fatorda legislator said in the face of the Rs 35,000 crore mining scam detailed by the Justice M B Shah commission report, a recovery of Rs 16 crore was a pittance. “The government is not failing in recovering losses suffered because of illegal mining, but you are intentionally made to fail,” Sardesai said, when his repeated questions seeking to know when the total losses would be recovered failed to elicit answers from Sawant. NCP MLA Churchill Alemao said the government ought to tell the House what the volume of the mining scam was, if was not Rs 35,000 crore. The allegations of scams led to the defeat of the Congress-led government in 2012 and BJP emerged victories. Losses will be computed as per reports received from chartered accountants, said Sawant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-recovery-of-mining-losses-in-last-9-years-vijai/articleshow/81695959.cms||---

He, however, did not clarify which destinations use Goa as a transit route. Sawant, who was responding to a question tabled by Congress MLA Ravi Naik, said 775 drug-related cases were booked by various police stations, the crime branch and the anti-narcotics cell between 2017 and February 2021. Eighteen cases have been filed under provisions of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act in the last two months alone, he said. The chief minister added that while 148 such cases were booked last year, the number was still less than that booked in 2019 and 2018. The highest number of cases (222) was booked under the NDPS Act in the year 2018. People in the know say that shortly after lockdown measures were lifted, rave parties that had come to a standstill in northern parts of Goa, restarted. The Narcotics Control Bureau recently busted a rave party at Ozrant beach in North Goa and detained five people, including a Swiss national. Goa receives eight to nine lakh international tourists and 80 lakh domestic visitors each year, although footfalls dropped drastically in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. While the state didn’t take in any foreign tourists last year, tourism stakeholders are expecting the situation to change as a direct flight between Goa and Russia was announced recently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-transit-route-for-drug-smuggling-cm-tells-house/articleshow/81695964.cms||---

Curtorim MLA Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco in his calling attention said, “There is anxiety and mental agony caused to the residents of Curtorim village and the surrounding Macazana village over the state government’s move to set up an IRBn camp on the one lakh square meter of Leprosy Hospital land which was transferred to Goa Police by the directorate of health services. What is the action the government proposes to take in this regard.” With folded hands Lourenco urged Sawantnot to set up an IRBn camp in the village and instead suggested a hospital or education institute. Replying to calling attention, Sawant said that land has been transferred to set up the camp. He said that some of the land has been encroached upon and if they don’t utilise the area, it would be further encroached. He said he will issue directions to conduct a land survey to check on encroachment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mlas-oppose-irbn-camp-at-macazana/articleshow/81695978.cms||---

Ponda MLA Ravi Naik in his Zero Hour mention said that there is fear and panic in the minds of people due to exorbitant water bills issued by the public works department (PWD). “People have received water bills with inspection charge of Rs 100 in addition to the meter charge of Rs 78. What does the government intend to do about it?” Naik said. Sawant said he has made a detailed reply on the issue in his budget speech. “We will revise the water bills and people will get very less water bills,” he said. Porvorim MLA Rohan Khaunte said that meter inspection charges are imposed based on the 2018 notification and after it was pointed out in the audit. “Audit is conducted by the government. I urge you to give instructions to the officer not to implement this till the bills are rectified,” Khaunte said. The Porvorim MLA said that if the one water bill is not paid then junior engineers disconnect the supply. “The chief minister’s intention is good, but there is a need to give instructions to officers not to act till it is rectified,” Khaunte said. Stating that disconnecting water supply if the unpaid bill amount of three months and above is justified, the chief minister said, “I will inform the department not to disconnect water supply of consumers if one bill is unpaid.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/relief-on-water-bills-cm-says-charges-to-be-revised/articleshow/81695988.cms||---

Town and country planning (TCP) minister Chandrakant Kavlekar said that there are teething problems when a new system is put in place, and if required more people will be trained for smooth operations. The TCP department issues various certificates and permissions through the new system to speed up the process of building plan compliance checks. Sardesai, a former TCP minister, said that as stakeholders were not consulted or imparted training, they are facing difficulties using the system since the portal is not user-friendly. The portal was launched in November last year. The Fatorda MLA said that the system was supposed to improve the ease of doing business. “From November 2020 till date, 112 application have been received. However, only four have been cleared,” Sardesai said. The former TCP minister questioned the government’s haste in launching the system. “Goans who want to build residential houses are facing difficulties. The system is put in place to trouble locals,” he said.

The government has been deliberating on a casino policy since 2017 but hasn’t reached any conclusion so far. Delays in notifying the casino policy has consequently deferred the appointment of a gaming commissioner. Also pending is the shifting of offshore casinos to other locations. To a question by Porvorim MLA Rohan Khaunte, Sawant said that the cabinet had decided to extend the licences of offshore casinos up to March 31 and that the process of shifting the casinos to the identified sites is under examination. The Captain of Ports, has recommended several alternative locations. The government, however, is yet to arrive at a conclusion in the matter, an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/4-years-on-casino-policy-still-under-deliberation/articleshow/81696116.cms||---
---||Goa||Cut in VAT on fuel depends on state’s finances: CM||PORVORIM: Reduction of the Value Added Tax (VAT) on fuel and LPG in the state will depend on the improvement in the state’s finances, said chief minister Pramod Sawant in a written statement to the House on Thursday. Sawant, who also holds the finance portfolio, said that Goa government will try reducing the state’s share of VAT on fuel “whenever possible” but did not specify what criteria would be taken into account while considering the state’s financial situation. A day earlier, Sawant admitted that the Covid-19 pandemic has hit the Goa’s economy and the state exchequer hard. With the state’s own tax revenue shrinking and the Centre yet to completely clear Goa’s dues under the GST compensation mechanism, the Sawant-led government is desperately trying to shore up its coffers by keeping taxes on fuel on the higher side. “Government will try reducing state’s share of VAT imposed on petrol and petroleum products, whenever possible,” said Sawant. “It will depend on the receipt and expenditure scenario at relevant point of time.” In February, the BJP government hiked the VAT on petrol to 27% and on diesel to 23%. According to data tabled in the recently-concluded winter assembly session, Goa earned just Rs 625 crore in 2020-21 (till December) against Rs 1,124 crore in 2019-20. While presenting his budget last year, Sawant had estimated VAT collections at Rs 1,220 crore. Goa’s public debt is expected to touch Rs 17,962.24 crore by March end this year. In the last 10 days, petrol prices in Goa have been fluctuating between Rs 88.27 and Rs 89.15. State-run fuel retailers reduced fuel prices for the first time in over a year as crude oil prices tumbled. Petrol was cheaper by 18 paise and diesel by 17 paise per litre. Data from the Centre puts Goa’s annual consumption of petrol and diesel at around 184 TMT and 316 TMT, respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cut-in-vat-on-fuel-depends-on-states-finances-cm/articleshow/81696141.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Hospital discharges 30 patients after oxygen shortage, 4 die||Nagpur: The district woke up to another crisis on Saturday with private Covid hospitals badly gasping for medical oxygen since Friday night as the demand increased five-fold due to surge in critical patients. Acting swiftly, the district collector Ravindra Thakare named resident deputy collector Avinash Katade as nodal officer and started a dedicated line for O2 related requests from hospitals. Plans are afoot to draw more oxygen from Bhilai, seek tankers from Mumbai, Pune and Hyderabad and stop supply to Akola and Nandurbar. The move came after a 30-bed hospital in North Nagpur discharged all its Covid patients, 11 of them in critical condition, on March 25 after its oxygen stock exhausted and health authorities allegedly failed to replenish it. Four of the critical patients passed away – one of them at the hospital itself as per civic officials. The hospital said the 74-year-old deceased was on oxygen support till she was in admission. Beds were arranged for the remaining three patients at nearby government and private hospitals where they died. Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) issued a show cause notice to the hospital and initiated an inquiry. Twenty more were shifted to other hospitals. On Friday, a 100-bed hospital in West Nagpur created a flutter after it asked relatives of all patients to get discharged and find other hospitals. Late in the night, the district health officials rushed 40 jumbo cylinders to the hospital where relatives were in panic. District guardian minister Nitin Raut told TOI that divisional commissioner has been asked to take stock of the production and where the supply is going. “We have the local production capacity but since cylinders are also being supplied to places outside district, this issue is coming up. We may request state health department to allocate extra stock for Nagpur,” he said. O2 nodal officer Katade said the demand has shot up five-fold from 19-20 metric tonne per day to 100 metric tonne on Saturday. “The supply is smooth. The shortage-like situation is because more oxygen is needed. We need at least 5 to 10 tonne more to maintain a buffer. It will be increased as every day the demand is rising,” he said. Katade said Nagpur district’s own production is being augmented. “By Sunday morning 600 empty jumbo cylinders from Gadchiroli, Bhandara, Gondia and Amravati will arrive. Our manufacturers need them to fill additional stock. Another 700 to 800 cylinders would be requisitioned from GMCH which has two big tanks of liquid oxygen,” he said. All these filled cylinders would be supplied to private DCHs in the next couple of days. “We have requested MP government to scale up supply to five from three tankers. Inox Air Products Ltd, the major supplier in region, has been asked to stop supply to Akola and Nandurbar as they have a plant there. Six officers have been deployed to check requirement and supply at private hospitals,” he said. Regarding the four deaths, additional municipal commissioner Jalaj Sharma said prima facie one death was not linked to oxygen shortage. “Remaining three patients were arranged oxygen-supported ambulance and doctors accompanied them. They were stable but died later. Investigation is on. We have instructed hospitals not to shift patients unless they get confirmation from other hospitals,” he said. Dr Prakash Kshatriya, director of Shraman Hospital which discharged the patients, said they were left with just four hours of oxygen and apprehended fatalities. “We ensured they get beds elsewhere,” he said. Kunal Hospital director Dr Shishir Shrivastav said they were left with no option then to ask relatives to find alternatives. “The administration eventually helped us and we reversed the decision,” he said. Dr Kshatriya and Dr Shrivastav said the oxygen shortage is the worst seen in years in Nagpur. What happened* On March 25, Shraman Hospital at Kamal Chowk discharged 25 Covid patients, stopped taking admissions citing oxygen shortage * Four patients die, linked to the decision to shift them; hospital ruled it out * NMC issued show cause notice to hospital * On Friday night, Kunal Hospital at Mankapur asked relatives to take away their patients as oxygen stock was about to finish * More private hospitals complained of O2 shortage but no help from administration Taking control* Divisional commissioner holds Covid task force meeting on Saturday * District collector names RDC Avinash Katade as nodal officer for O2 related issues * 0712-2565230. Dedicated line for O2 related requests from hospitals Demand and supply* District required 19 to 20 metric tonne per day on normal days and even when daily 100 to 200 Covid cases were reported * On Friday, demand shot up to 100 metric tonne as private hospitals are treating large number of patients * Admin has requested MP govt to increase two more liquid oxygen tanker from Bhilai. Right now 3 tankers are supplied * Supply by major manufacturers to Akola and Nandurbar stopped * District production augmented, around 1,400 jumbo cylinders from Gadchiroli, Amravati, Bhandara, Gondia and GMCH would be filled * Pvt hospitals will be provided jumbo cylinders||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hospital-discharges-30-patients-after-oxygen-shortage-4-die/articleshow/81723480.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

This is the second such meeting in less than a week. Legislators from central and Kalyan-Karnataka regions mainly attended the over two-hour meeting. While they claimed that some ministers’ reluctance to release funds for constituencies and the strategy for the April 17 bypolls were the key talking points, BJP insiders said that the gathering’s real purpose was to consolidate support for Yediyurappa. There is some speculation that BJP might consider leadership change in Karnataka after the assembly elections in four states. There was similar chatter a few months ago, but Yediyurappa remained in control. Senior BJP legislator Basanagouda Patil Yatnal, who has repeatedly questioned Yediyurappa’s leadership, was also a subject of discussion, the insiders claimed. The MLAs decided that they would complain against Yatnal to national BJP president JP Nadda. Twenty-five to 30 BJP MLAs have apparently signed a letter seeking disciplinary action against him. Yediyurappa and MLAs in his camp believe that Yatnal is backed by some senior party members in Karnataka and Delhi. This may be why no serious action has been taken against Yatnal despite his repeated comments against the chief minister. Yediyurappa loyalists expressed unhappiness that ministers were not condemning Yatnal. Some reportedly complained about rural development and panchayat raj minister KS Eshwarappa, claiming he was not releasing adequate funds for development works in their constituencies. “Every time we go to them (ministers) for funds, they cite the pandemic and turn down our request. The RDPR minister has withheld funds for works cleared by the finance minister,” an MLA alleged. Yediyurappa assured them that he would resolve the issue soon. “If any minister delays releasing funds, you come to me and I will get the work done. But don’t go to the media as it will send a wrong message about the government,” he reportedly told the MLAs. Ministers Govind Karjol, B Sriramulu and Murugesh Nirani and CM’s political secretary, MP Renukacharya, were present at the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/25-mlas-meet-bsy-discuss-ways-to-tackle-yatnal/articleshow/81700665.cms||---

---||Business||Second Covid wave won’t affect economic growth: Shaktikanta Das||NEW DELHI: Reserve Bank of India governor Shaktikanta Das on Thursday said economic revival is expected to continue unabated as vaccination and experience of dealing with the coronavirus will reduce the impact of the recent surge in cases. “This time around, compared to last year March or April, we have additional insurance. First is the vaccine that is being rolled out….The second aspect is that people are more used to the Covid protocol….Third, at this point in time, one does not foresee a lockdown like the one we saw last year,” he said at the Times Network India Economic Conclave, while sticking to the 10.5% growth projection for the next financial year. Coronavirus: Live updatesDas said Indian payment networks — Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and Real Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS) — have the potential to go global. UPI could be “a cheaper and faster alternative to available means for multilateral cross-border payments…. our RTGS also has multicurrency capabilities and with 24x7 operations now, there is a scope to explore whether its footprint could be expanded beyond India.” About the ongoing reforms, Das said RBI is finalising guidelines on NBFC dividend distribution and scale-based regulation, and added that regulation should foster innovation “without compromising the need for financial sector stability, cybersecurity, customer protection, etc.” He said digital players would play an important role this decade as service providers directly to customers or through banks as their agents or associates. Das sought to comfort bond markets, especially when yields are rising and the central bank has made some strong comments in recent weeks. “There is no fight between central bank and bond market….What we are emphasizing is there should be orderly evolution of the yield curve and not sudden spikes or knee-jerk reactions to certain incoming numbers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/second-covid-wave-wont-affect-growth-das/articleshow/81698374.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi man poisons in-laws with thallium, two dead||NEW DELHI: Nursing a grudge against his in-laws for supporting his wife's decision to abort their child last year, a small-time builder in Greater Kailash-I allegedly poisoned his wife and her family members by mixing the chemical, thallium, which is highly toxic, in their food on New Year's Eve. He believed that his father who died last year would be reincarnated as his child. Thallium has got no colour, odour or taste. It acts slowly and causes wide-ranging symptoms, which come in the way of a diagnosis of poisoning. After Varun Arora, 37, administered the poison, his mother-in-law, Anita Devi Sharma, 62, and her younger daughter, Priyanka, 27, died in hospital in the course of two months while his wife, Divya, 35, is in a coma. Found in online search history: How to make someone very sickHe spared his two children, four-year-old twins, a boy and a girl. His father-in-law and their maid are under treatment. Arora has been arrested for the murders and the police claim to have seized the chemical which was stored in a small glass bottle from his house. “We have also seized his mobile phone which he had used to procure the chemical. He has been booked for murder and attempt to murder,” said deputy commissioner of police (west) Urvija Goel. The police found that Arora had searched the internet on “how to make someone very sick” and got the idea of using thallium. Arora’s plot started unravelling on March 22 after Inderpuri police station got a call from Sir Ganga Ram Hospital that a woman, Anita, who had been under treatment at the hospital for over a month, had died. The police were told that Anita was admitted to the hospital on March 4 and traces of thallium had been detected in her blood and urine samples. Deputy commissioner of police Goel said the police began to trace the source of the poison. It was found that the woman’s elder daughter, Divya, was also admitted at the same hospital on March 6 and she too had consumed thallium. According to Dr Rajeev Ranjan, senior consultant, department of neurology at the hospital, Divya came with unexplained neurological symptoms and is currently in the ICU on ventilator support. “The patient’s mother and her sister, who had no known illness, were also rushed to hospital with similar symptoms and died. This led to suspicion of poisoning and our tests revealed high levels of thallium. We wrote to the police and also sent a letter to National Commission for Women for providing security to the family,” said Dr Ranjan. As the probe progressed, pieces of the puzzle began to fall in place. “Divya’s younger sister, Priyanka, had also died while undergoing treatment at B L Kapoor Hospital on February 15. Thallium poisoning was mentioned in her medical reports. This raised our suspicion. We found that their father, Devender Mohan Sharma, was also undergoing treatment for symptoms of thallium poisoning while their maid was being treated at Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital for similar symptoms,” said DCP Goel. The chain of events suggested that the entire family had been administered thallium by someone, possibly an insider. A detailed autopsy was then carried out on both Anita and Priyanka at RML Hospital by a board of doctors. A team of forensic experts also visited Sharma’s house and detected traces of thallium. It was found that Divya lived with her husband, Varun Arora, in GK-I. Their probe revealed that the two families did not have very good relations. When Arora was questioned, he is claimed to have admitted that he had given the family fish laced with thallium when he visited them on January 31. “He said he made sure his wife and her parents and sister ate the fish. Because Priyanka was not at home at the time of dinner, he waited for her to return and made sure she ate the dish,” said the officer. DCP Goel said when asked about his reasons for targeting the entire family, Arora said he wanted to take revenge because his in-laws had supported his wife’s decision to abort their child last year. “He said his father had died last year, and after his wife conceived, he believed that the child was his father’s reincarnation. But Divya developed complications, and with the support of her family she aborted the child against Arora’s wishes,” the DCP added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-man-poisons-in-laws-with-thallium-two-dead/articleshow/81698406.cms||---
---||Business||City tops among metros with 3-fold jump in realty sales||Kolkata: The City of Joy has recorded the highest surge in residential real estate sales in the first quarter of 2021 (January-March) compared to the last quarter Q4 (Oct-Dec) of 2020 among all the metro cities. Kolkata has witnessed a three-fold jump in numbers (201%) during the period, finds a study of JLL, one of the leading global real estate consultants. During the same period, Delhi has recorded a jump of 23%, Chennai 28%, Mumbai 15%, while Bengaluru clocked a degrowth of 6%. As per the JLL study, there has been a notable growth in Q1 (calendar year) of 2021 even compared to Q1 2020, which was a pre-Covid situation. According to the report, residential sales in Q1 (Jan-March) 2021 recovered to more than 90% of the volume witnessed in Q1 2020 (pre-Covid) across the top-seven cities. The cities include Chennai, Hyderabad, Kolkata, and Pune surpassed the sales volumes of Q1 2020. Overall sales increased by 17% on a sequential basis. Importantly, sales either improved or stayed at similar levels (in Q1 2021, when compared to Q4 2020) in the majority of the residential markets under consideration. Mumbai has consistently been the largest contributor to sales in the last four quarters. In Q1 2021, Mumbai accounted for 23% of the sales, followed by Delhi NCR with a share of 21%. “However, Kolkata saw the maximum increase in sales activity in Q1 2021 in comparison with the fourth quarter of 2020. In Kolkata, the offtake of residential units in Q1 2021 was driven by southern suburbs (Joka, Kasba, Behala, Jadavpur, Tollygunj) and eastern suburbs (EM Bypass, Rajarhat, Topsia) with a combined contribution of more than 70%,” the report added. “The sustained growth in sales presents clear signs of demand and buyer confidence coming back to the market. This has been on the back of historically low home loan interest rates, stagnant residential prices, lucrative payment plans and freebies from developers and government incentives such as the reduction of stamp duty in states like Maharashtra and Karnataka (for affordable housing). The ease of lockdown restrictions and the commencement of the vaccination drive have further aided in bringing buyers back to the market,” said Samantak Das, chief economist and Head Research & REIS, JLL. The first quarter of 2021 witnessed new launches of 33,953 residential units, a jump of 27% over the last quarter of 2020. The leading real estate players from the city also agreed with the JLL findings. The Credai, national president-elect, H V Patodia, said that all the cities, including Kolkata, have witnessed a surge in sales. “Due to work-from-home phenomenon and lower home loan rate, people are buying bigger flats also,” he added. Credai Bengal president Nandu Belani also endorsed Patodia’s views by saying that there is a huge demand surge in Kolkata, which is good for real estate. “Real estate is the safest investment and people are relying on that as well,” he added. Merlin Group MD Saket Mohta also has the same experience. “Now, the numbers are more than that of the pre-Covid level. There is particularly a good demand for ready-to-move-in flats and there is a traction for new launches also,” he added. Sanjay Jain, MD of Siddha Group, also feels that there is definite growth in the first quarter of this calendar year in Kolkata and other markets. Jain Group director Rishi Jain, Eden Realty Ventures MD Arya Sumant and Jitendra Khaitan of Pioneer Properties also expressed a similar opinion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/city-tops-among-metros-with-3-fold-jump-in-realty-sales/articleshow/81695689.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: No anticipatory bail for waving sword at Red Fort||NEW DELHI: A city court refused anticipatory bail to a man accused of rioting at Red Fort during the farmers’ tractor rally on Republic Day, observing that no citizen can have unfettered liberty to celebrate a national event in a way the applicant was shown in photos. The applicant said he was only displaying a martial art skills, reports Aamir Khan. Additional sessions judge Charu Aggarwal observed that it was an “overt act” where he was waving a “big sword” in the prohibited area of Red Fort. ‘Liberty fundamental human dignity, but regulated by the law’ The court noted that the photographs and videos shown placed on record told a different story. “Liberty, albeit, is the fundamental human dignity of every citizen but such liberty is regulated by law. The allegations against the applicant are serious. His custodial interrogation is required to unearth certain facts. No ground for anticipatory bail is made out,” it held. The court also observed that the argument on behalf of Preet Pal Singh that every citizen has the right to celebrate Republic Day in his own way and it was the way of the applicant to celebrate was prima facie not convincing. Singh, through his counsel, submitted that he was only 37 years of age and from a respectable family. It was argued that the FIR didn’t attribute any specific role and even hypothetically only the allegation of breaking of barricades, attracting IPC Section 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), a bailable offence, was against him. The counsel argued that Singh had participated in the peaceful protest during the tractor rally and neither was he an instigator nor did he have an active role in the alleged crime. It was also submitted that he was not a part of the violence that took place at Red Fort. Singh was, therefore, stated to have only displayed a martial art form with a "khanda" (big sword). The counsel pointed out that Singh’s action of waving the khanda was a tableaux by him, which probably was not liked by the state. The counsel said his client was ready to join the investigation as and when called by the IO. Singh, it was argued, was not shown to have attacked any police personnel or damaged public property in the FIR and he wasn’t connected to any political group or kisan organisation. The state’s prosecutor opposed the applicant's contentions saying the photographs placed on record by the investigating officer showed his “active role” as an instigator of the mob and attacking police personnel with swords.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-no-anticipatory-bail-for-waving-sword-at-red-fort/articleshow/81698420.cms||Aamir Khan
---||Kolkata||UP, MP cops reach Bengal, put on duty in districts||Kolkata: Thirty companies of Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) from Uttar Pradesh and 20 companies of State Armed Police (SAP) from Madhya Pradesh have reached Bengal, and were deployed across districts on Thursday. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee and the Trinamool Congress have questioned this deployment of police from other states whose CMs are BJP’s star campaigners in Bengal. While PAC personnel have been sent to the Sunderbans and Diamond Harbour police districts, West Midnapore, Bankura, Alipurduar and Cooch Behar, armed police from MP have been deployed in Bankura, Hooghly, Howrah and Diamond Harbour. The first phase of polling on Saturday will see 684 companies of central forces along with 11,000 state cops. The second phase on April 1 will be manned by 636 companies of central forces and 12,000 state police personnel. A senior EC official said SAP and PAC teams were being used for “area domination” as of now. It is still not clear how they will be used on the polling day, he said, but added that the police units from UP and MP would most likely be used during the second, third and fourth phases. It is expected that central forces from other poll-bound states will reach Bengal after April 6. The EC official said the later phases of polling would see around 1,000 companies of central forces. “We need to acclimatise with the area concerned and were thus sent to Diamond Harbour on Thursday though polling there is scheduled for April 6,” a PAC officer said. A SAP officer from MP said they were deployed also during the Bihar assembly polls and there was no controversy or major trouble. “We hope to act according to the directives of the SP,” the officer said, adding that they would currently be posted in Bankura where polling was scheduled for April 1.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/up-mp-cops-reach-bengal-put-on-duty-in-districts/articleshow/81696562.cms||---
