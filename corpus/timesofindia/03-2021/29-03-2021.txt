Many said that on Marine Drive, police personnel were asking citizens to disperse. Mahendra’s Hemdev, a local, who was taking his regular walk pointed out on weekends, the promenade is known to see large crowds. But by 8pm, the entire promenade was empty. Amid the recent surge in coronavirus cases, the Maharashtra government has announced a complete ban on holding of all types of gatherings, including political and religious. The government has also ordered that restaurants, gardens, and malls will remain shut between 8pm to 7am beginning Saturday night. People will also not be allowed to visit beaches during this period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/covid-19-night-curfew-in-mumbai-tourist-hotspots-wear-a-deserted-look/articleshow/81739684.cms||Richa Pinto

The cryptic response, which stopped well short of denying whether he had met the NCP duo, came after speculation swirled through the day of a secret meeting. NCP, however, came out with a formal denial late in the evening. “There was no such meeting, it is a BJP conspiracy,” NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik told TOI. It is a fact that Pawar and Patel were in Ahmedabad but they never met Shah. It is planted news to divert attention from main issues," Malik said. Sources confirmed that Shah as well as Pawar and Patel happened to be in Ahmedabad on Saturday but there was no clarity on whether they met. The development came as tensions sparked by the sensational plot to extort money from industrialist Mukesh Ambani escalated among constituents of MVA, and triggered speculation in the country’s political and financial capitals. Amit Shah, BJP sources said, had taken time off his intense electioneering schedule to meet his two grand-daughters whom he dotes on. Likewise, sources in Ahmedabad’s business and political circles said Pawar and Patel, who were in Jaipur, had stopped in Ahmedabad on their way back to Mumbai and were hosted by industrialist Gautam Adani. However, there was no confirmation from any quarter of them meeting Shah at Adani’s residence or any other place in Ahmedabad. Pawar and Patel’s original plan was to visit the Statue of Unity along with Gujarat CM Vijay Rupani. However, the plan was shelved due to rising Covid-19 cases. They decided to make a detour to Ahmedabad on their way back to Mumbai and after landing at Ahmedabad airport at 9.30 pm, drove straight to Adani’s residence. Sources said they stayed overnight and left the next morning after breakfast. If lack of verifiable information about the “meeting” failed to quell speculation, it has only partly to do with Shah refraining from scotching it. The buzz gained traction because of the timing. Sunday also saw NCP member and Maharashtra deputy CM Ajit Pawar taking exception to Sena’s MP Sanjay Raut taking a dig at Anil Deshmukh by saying that the latter got charge of the home department after Jayant Patil and Dilip Walse-Patil backed out. The sense of intrigue about the sheer happenstance of Shah and the NCP duo being in Ahmedabad amid a busy electioneering season had not abated even after Nawab Malik blamed the rampant curiosity on a conspiracy by BJP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/buzz-of-pawar-shah-meet-adds-spice-to-maharashtra-saga/articleshow/81740542.cms||---

Excerpts from his interview with TOI’s BS AnilkumarYour relation with media has never been smooth. But the same media now predicts a second innings for your government, prompting the opposition to accuse the media of being hand in glove with you. Your reaction?There is no friction with the media. I regularly interact with them and respond to their questions. When the people of Kerala are overwhelmingly supporting this government, it is difficult even for media houses that oppose us to mask the public sentiment, that's all. Sabarimala has now become a hard nut to crack. What really is the assurance that you offer to devotees?The case is being reviewed by the honourable Supreme Court. Once the judiciary pronounces a verdict, we will discuss it with all those concerned and move forward accordingly. Can CPM and Congress oppose each other earnestly, since both stand as a single block outside Kerala, even in Tamil Nadu?We have been opposed to Congress even during the pre-independence era. In independent India, we have been their staunchest critics, especially on their economic policies and soft communal overtures. In Tamil Nadu, the alliance is led by DMK against NDA, there the onus is on fighting communalism. And when the fight is between communal and secular forces, we are willing to cooperate with all secular and democratic formations. Communists oppose idolizing leaders and you too had cautioned about this. But, for the first time, your picture is widely used in the campaign. How do you justify this?As I said, it is the politics that matters, not the person. We are seeking the people's support not in my name, but for LDF on the basis of an election manifesto.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/kerala/willing-to-cooperate-in-fight-against-communal-forces-pinarayi-vijayan/articleshow/81740862.cms||B S Anilkumar
---||---||BJP, Left spar over Kerala’s ED probe||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: BJP and the Left crossed swords over the decision by the LDF government in Kerala to initiate judicial inquiry against the Enforcement Directorate (ED), which is probing the gold smuggling case. On Sunday, while Union defence minister Rajnath Singh called the move “unconstitutional and unfortunate”, CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury hit back, saying no central agency can interfere in the affairs of the state unless there is a consent from the state government. Rajnath, who was in Kerala on Sunday to address NDA’s election rallies, said at a news conference that the LDF government’s decision went against federal principles. Yechury, who also addressed a meet-the-press programme on Sunday, said Rajnath should study the Constitution first before criticising the Kerala government for ordering a judicial probe against ED officials. Criticising the incumbent LDF government in Kerala and the UDF, Rajnath said: “LDF and UDF should spell out why Kerala failed to move ahead on developmental front, despite being the most-literate state in India. LDF and UDF, that rule the state in turns, defeat the people of Kerala. The Pinarayi Vijayan government has ruined the social balance in Kerala,” claimed Singh. Singh alleged that LDF is trying to cheat people by making bogus promises. The minister said the state government cheated the fishermen by inking an agreement with a foreign company for deep-sea fishing. “It was Narendra Modi who established the fisheries department at the Centre and there are plans to introduce fishermen cards like Kisan cards. The Centre is also considering a proposal to give them Rs 6,000 a year,” he said. Meanwhile, Yechury, speaking on the Sabarimala women-entry issue, said the party will inspect under what circumstances devaswom minister Kadakampally Surendran expressed regret over government action on women-entry at Sabarimala. Yechury alleged that there is a deal between Congress and BJP in Kerala. “The statement of BJP state president K Surendran that the party will come to power if it gets 35 seats hints at this tie-up. The recent statement by BJP leader O Rajagopal that he got Congress votes from Nemom in 2016 proves the hidden tie-up,” said Yechury.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/kerala/bjp-left-spar-over-keralas-ed-probe/articleshow/81740953.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Divers recover ‘evidence’ Waze threw into river||MUMBAI: The National Investigating Agency on Sunday took arrested assistant police inspector Sachin Waze to the Mithi river in Mumbai, from where divers fished out a laptop and a cellphone belonging to him along with three hard disks, two car number plates and as many DVRs. The recorders are believed to contain footage from CCTV cameras at the Mumbai Police headquarters and the Thane housing society where Waze resides. The NIA is looking for the evidence on the basis of a statement by Riyazuddin Kazi, a cop who reported to Waze. The items added to the body of evidence gathered by the NIA so far as part of its probe into how an explosives-laden Scorpio was planted near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s bungalow and the subsequent murder of car owner Mansukh Hiran. One of the recovered DVRs contained footage of vehicle movement at the city police headquarters while the second one reportedly has video evidence of one of the two vehicles involved in the crime being parked in Waze’s housing society. Sources said Riyazuddin Kazi’s statement was recorded before a magistrate under Section 164 of CrPC, which enables the items recovered thereafter to be treated as evidence. “Kazi will be a witness in the case. We need to gather more information from him,” a source said. The Scorpio containing gelatine was found outside Ambani’s residence on February 25. Hiran’s body was found in the Mumbra creek on the morning of March 5. Another vehicle, an Innova, had tailed the Scorpio that had been parked in Waze’s society before it was found near Ambani’s bungalow. The recovery of the number plates is also significant given the fact that the Scorpio and Innova bore fake number plates. The police had questioned owners of two shops who allegedly made the number plates at Waze’s behest. The suspects in the case had used several mobile phones without security features that had been procured from the grey market. These phones were later destroyed, the NIA has found out. Waze’s phone had been missing too. The NIA on Sunday seized the Innova lying with the motor transport department of the city police. Officials said five to six professional divers were engaged by the agency for the recovery of evidence from the Mithi river.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/divers-recover-evidence-waze-threw-into-river/articleshow/81740972.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||India||On air, PM Modi reiterates 'dawai bhi, kadai bhi'||NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday reiterated the message of 'dawai bhi, kadai bhi' (medicine and discipline), cautioning people against slackening against the coronavirus even as he said seniors opting for shots with enthusiasm should be role models for everyone. Modi also spoke on the need for modernisation of the agriculture sector and the tourism potential of lighthouses in the country. He said adopting modern practices in the agriculture sector was imperative. "In India's agriculture sector, modernisation is the need of the hour. It has been delayed and we have already lost a lot of time," Modi said. "To create new employment opportunities in agriculture, to increase farmers' income, it is equally important to adopt new alternatives and innovations along with traditional agricultural practices," he added. The PM again pitched for bee farming as the foundation of a 'sweet revolution' and said farmers from Darjeeling and Sundarbans to Banaskantha in Gujarat and Yamuna Nagar in Haryana have taken to bee farming to increase their income. "Honey bee farming does not lead to income solely from honey, but bee wax is also a very big source of income. There is demand for bee wax in everything, pharmaceuticals, food, textiles and cosmetics industries," he said. He referred to his putting up the proposal for bee farming in 2016 at the Banaskantha meeting. On Sunday, Modi lauded India's 'Nari Shakti' in sports, lauding cricketer Mithali Raj and shuttler P V Sindhu for their feats. Raj became the first Indian woman to complete 10,000 runs across formats, while Sindhu finished runners-up at the Swiss Open earlier this month. On the tourism front, Modi said India was working towards strengthening tourism facilities in 71 lighthouses that have been identified for developing a tourism circuit and appreciated the efforts of lighthouse keepers in doing their duty diligently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/on-air-pm-reiterates-dawai-bhi-kadai-bhi/articleshow/81740985.cms||---

Mahato's arrest under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act came three days after the Calcutta high court exempted him from custodial interrogation by the NIA in another 2009 case pertaining to the murder of a CPM functionary in Lalgarh. Mahato's lawyer, Kaushik Sinha, questioned the need for an NIA contingent to raid his client's house in Lalgarh in the dead of night. A day before his arrest, Mahato had told that he was questioned for six hours in Kolkata on Friday before he rushed back to Lalgarh to attend a party meeting. "I am meeting NIA officers (in the murder case) as per court orders," he said. While temporarily shielding him from custodial interrogation, the high court had directed Mahato to appear before the NIA at its Salt Lake office in Kolkata thrice a week and not leave Bengal till the next hearing on April 16.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/nia-nabs-tmc-leader-mahato-in-12-year-old-case/articleshow/81741001.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Ahmedabad||Blind chartered accountant of Gujarat wipes off fate’s liabilities||AHMEDABAD: In the ledger of life, Vadodara resident Darpan Inani, 27, had his blindness in the debit column, but by balancing that fact with his vision of future, he has become one of the few CAs of Gujarat having complete or partial blindness. Tools such as screen readers played a part in his success but it was his undimmed sight of his goal that made him navigate his way through the challenges. Inani cracked the exam in his sixth attempt. He has a clear-eyed view on his ordeal. “It’s a highly visual field — one must look at debit and credit sides of the balance sheet,” he said. “One must make entries and pore over multiple documents.” Inani went on to say: “But I along with my father had conceptualized a technique with which I used to visualize entire balance sheets.” That involved creating an intricate mental blueprint of transactions comprising categories and sub-categories of his own making. If for instance Rs 27 lakh was being spent by a company on, say, a new machine, Inani could instantly slot it in the right sub-category. He could also work out the implication of the expenditure on the overall balance sheet. Inani’s father Satish Inani said: “Darpan competed with his sighted friends throughout his school days and that expanded his limits.” Satish added: “My wife and I would read out to him or help him with his studies. Technology was a major boon as he would go through his CA textbooks with a screen reader.” In the last year of the chartered accountancy course, Inani had to buy a few video lectures to get clarity on some concepts. “He has not received any tuitions,” Satish said. Indeed, Inani has never sought any extra consideration. He lost his vision at the age of three due to a reaction to an injection. His parents chose not to send him to a special school and encouraged him to assimilate in a ‘normal’ school. The only child of a jeweller and a homemaker, Inani studied at home till he was eight. A school accepted him with the condition that there would be no concessions for him. With the support of his parents, he aced the exams. CA Aniket Talati, a central council member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI), said that Inani could well be one of the rare blind CAs from Gujarat. “While the institute doesn’t have a separate category for persons with disabilities, senior members recall two with visual impairments,” Talati said.

Experts point at Ashish Mankad, a Junagadh-based practicing chartered accountant, as the first blind CA from Gujarat. Mankad, who cracked the highly competitive exam in 1992, said that he can relate to the struggle and elation of Inani. "I wish his case inspires more people with disabilities to join the profession," Mankad told TOI. Inani said that in 2016, he cracked the CAT and got a call letter from IIM-Lucknow among other B-schools. “But being a CA was the pinnacle of achievement for me,” he said. “Of course, I take twice the time a normal person would to go through documents. But if it’s technology-compatible, I can deal with any text.” Based on his articleship experience, Inani is not keen on a job, but wants to set up his own firm. “I don’t want to venture into auditing which requires vision,” he said. “But today the profession has created other career trajectories such as arbitration and litigation where I can rely on my oratory skills and knowledge.” Inani’s mantra is that one must take criticism and scepticism on the chin. “Let your work speak for you,” said Inani, who incidentally has won 30 chess titles.

The health centre had received National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) accreditation in 2019. The NQAS cover aspects like service provision, patient rights, inputs, support services, clinical care, infection control, quality management and outcome. HRC chairman Justice (rtd) Antony Dominic said in the order that the district medical officer (DMO) shall pay the compensation and it can then be levied from officials responsible. The commission has directed the DMO to submit the report within two months after paying the compensation. The order was issued based on a complaint submitted by Chemmaruthi resident Swapna Sujith. Her mother, 67-year-old Prasanna got her blood tested at the hospital lab as part of diabetes treatment. When the results came platelet count showed 10,000 cells when it should ideally be 1.5-4 lakh cells. The patient was referred to emergency specialist treatment. However test results from a private hospital in Kollam showed 1.82 lakh cells. The complainant said that the doctor and health inspector of the hospital responded rudely to the patient when the error was brought to their notice. The commission has obtained a probe report from the DMO. The report said that there was no lapse on the part of hospital staff. The commission concluded that the lab report was erroneous which caused the complainant’s mother to seek expert treatment leading to mental distress and financial loss. In response to the HRC directive against an NQAS-accredited hospital, DMO Dr K S Shinu said that NQAS can’t ensure quality of each test and proficiency and dedication of every staff.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/human-rights-panel-orders-dmo-to-compensate-woman/articleshow/81739738.cms||---

While nearly 210 students of a private educational institution in Rajahmundry tested positive for the pandemic this week, about 100 cases surfaced among students of Andhra University College of Engineering. As many as 185 schoolchildren fell prey to the highly transmittable respiratory disease in various schools across the state in the last 10 days. Sporadic outbreaks have also been reported in various engineering colleges and other higher educational institutions across the state in recent weeks. Three weeks into the reopening of educational institutions in November 2020, about 1,000 teachers and 600 students tested positive when officials conducted tests on nearly five lakh teachers and students at about 40,000 schools. Even though there were a few cases of Covid-19 infections among students even after the reopening of educational institutions, it has been more acutely felt in the last two weeks in sync with the resurgence of the disease in Andhra Pradesh. While face-to-face instruction had begun for higher classes last year, primary schools resumed their offline academic activity only in February this year. Interestingly, about 90% of cases among students turned out to be asymptomatic. Bala Vikas Foundation honorary secretary Narava Prakasa Rao asked officials to ensure that educational institutions adhere to Covid-19 precautions. “Several schools have been accommodating hundreds of students in a single classroom, which may lead to easy transmission due to prolonged exposure,” said Prakasa Rao.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/spike-in-covid-cases-among-students-sets-off-alarm-bells/articleshow/81738976.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

For the first time, police seized ganja in liquid form apart from normal weed. The searches were held at different places under Arundalpet, Nagarampalem and Old Guntur police station limits. Cops identified ganja peddlers targeting college students, especially those enrolled in professional courses. Guntur Urban SP R N Ammi Reddy said they have deployed special surveillance teams to contain drug use in educational institutions. Some peddlers have been found disguising themselves as students to escape police notice. On Sunday, cops seized 65 bottles of liquid ganja and 2.4 kilos of weed worth Rs 3 lakh. As many as 45 cases were booked in the last nine months in Guntur city alone with cops seizing 292 kgs of ganja amounting to Rs 29 lakh. As many as 155 persons were arrested and in almost all cases, students were potential customers. With several engineering and medical colleges, including autonomous private universities in and around Guntur city, students here are soft targets for peddlers. While use of ganja was earlier prevalent in some private colleges, the latest trend suggests it has been spreading to other educational institutions as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/in-a-first-liquid-ganja-seized-8-held/articleshow/81738990.cms||Srikanth Aluri

---||Amaravati||Andhra Pradesh govt offices to get smart power meters||AMARAVATI: In a move that could have far reaching consequences, the state government has directed power distribution companies to replace existing electricity meters in all government offices, including local bodies with prepaid meters. The discoms have been permitted to procure smart/prepaid meters to replace the existing meters. Although the decision is likely to help discoms in getting their billing money in advance, it has to be seen how the government would manage the finances to pay the same to different departments and local bodies. The government had already started installation of smart meters for agriculture pumpsets in the state and is spending close to Rs 8,500 crore on free power supply for the agriculture sector. The government had to remit the entire metered amount into the respective farmers’ bank account as part of its Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) scheme. The respective power distribution companies would be allowed to take the entire amount from the farmer’s account without delay. Since free power is a prestigious scheme of the government, it might not delay in clearing payments under the scheme as this may result in disruption of supply. It is however not clear how the government will manage a similar situation with the needs of all departments. The government would clear bills, including power, maintenance and contractor bills, only after incurring expenditure. While it would take six months to clear bills in some cases, it may take years to clear pending bills in many cases. As a result of the delay in clearing bills, discoms were unable to collect dues from government departments for years together. Sources said that at least 30 per cent of the total dues of discoms are from the public sector units. The installation of prepaid meters might force all the departments to pay their bills in advance. “The Centre has requested the state government to install prepaid/smart meters in government departments, companies, ULBs by March 2022, as a pre-condition to release tranche-II payment under Liquidity Infusion Scheme under Atma Nirbhar Abhiyan Scheme,” said principal secretary, energy, Dr Nagulapalli Srikanth.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/ap-govt-offices-to-get-smart-power-meters/articleshow/81738996.cms||Samdani MN

Unidentified persons had broken into the temple and decamped with gold and silver jewellery and cash from the ‘hundi’ on March 21. The burglars had also snapped the connections to the CCTV cameras in the temple and taken away the hard disk and a VCR. Dalli Appala Reddy, secretary of Grama Seva Sangham said that the theft in the temple has hurt the sentiments of devotees and the police and other government departments must protect the sanctity of the temple by arresting the gang and recovering the missing ornaments. The temple has been neglected over the past few years in the absence of a permanent executive officer and no permanent security guards. “We are demanding the government appoint a permanent executive officer and also improve security measures to prevent such incidents,” Appala Reddy added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/waltair-locals-call-for-arrest-of-temple-thieves/articleshow/81739022.cms||---

With the number of Covid-19 cases in the state on the rise, doctors have suggested people increase their intake of foods rich in protein. This has resulted in a spurt in sales of chicken, mutton and fish. But despite the Covid-19 scare, markets across the city registered large volumes of sales on Sunday. The price of chicken, which fell to Rs 80 per kilogram on March 21 last year has now touched a record high of Rs 240 per kilogram. “Summer is a very tough time for poultry farming. The mortality rate of chickens is very high in summer, which results in a price hike. But we are witnessing huge demand this season and importing birds from East Godavari and Khammam districts to meet the demand,” K Yedukondalu, a chicken trader and member of Amaravati Poultry Traders Association (APTA) said. The cost of fish has likewise increased recently with high consumption. “Doctors are stressing on eating nutritious foods. But non-vegetarian foods have become costly. While mutton is priced at Rs 600 per kilogram in rural areas, meat traders are looting us in Vijayawada by charging Rs 800 per kilogram. Officials should track the price of mutton and other non-vegetarian foods,” said M Nagendra, a techie. Meanwhile, authorities of the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) have started to bust rackets that are cheating consumers by selling adulterating meat. Special inspection teams are carrying out regular inspections at markets and imposing penalties on traders found selling stale and adulterated meat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/chicken-prices-in-vij-touch-record-high/articleshow/81739029.cms||Venu Lanka

The consequential impact : Investment in hotel infrastructure dropped 84% in 2020 as compared to the peak witnessed in 2019 of $762 million.Following the lockdown though it has been the luxury leisure hotels that have rebounded fastest. “Luxury resorts picked up significantly and performed a lot better than luxury hotels in business cities. Luxury hotels in leisure cities such as Goa, Jaipur, Udaipur, Shimla etc. have performed extraordinarily between October 2020 and February 2021 and in some cases, have come closer to their RevPARs of winter months of 2019,” said Jaideep Dang, MD, hotels & hospitality Group, JLL India.“Business saw a gradual revival starting mid Q2, with Q3 gaining traction. Business has since been consistent with a gradual revival of business travel. So, on a YTD basis, RevPar has been impacted by over 50% for the industry,” Agreed Anil Chadha, COO, ITC Hotels.As for the luxury leisure revival, he agreed resort hotels are doing better than business properties. “Resort destinations like Goa and hill resorts in Himachal, etc. have seen unprecedented travel. ITC Grand Bharat in Gurgaon, ITC Rajputana in Jaipur, ITC Grand Goa, ITC Mughal in Agra have also seen significant traffic, and the trend continues till date. Domestic tourism is on the rise as people prefer to do short trips to motorable destinations and Staycations and Workcaytions are most popular,” he added.Agreed Dilip Kapur, founder of leather brand Hidesign who owns two luxury leisure hotel properties in Puducherry. “Our occupancies are down 30% and turnover is at 70% of last year. Our average room rate is down from Rs 7000 last year to Rs 5,800 now -- a combination of drop in occupancy as well as per room rate,” he said. However domestic travel has picked which has helped neutralise the international business which has dwindled, he said. “Normally 20-30% of my business around this time of the year would have come from international tourists but if I have managed to retain 70% of my turnover it is because domestic tourists made up for the business I lost from international travellers,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/luxury-leisure-hotels-rebound-even-as-avg-room-revenue-slumps/articleshow/81749036.cms||---

According to Adilabad SP Vishnu S Warrier, at around 5.30 pm, the fire started from a worker’s tent at the Chanaka-Korata project canal construction site in Pippalkoti village. “The fire might have started from a gas stove or from a beedi negligently thrown. The tent caught fire and it intensified due to cooking oils and other stored goods. Two wheelers parked near the tent caught fire and then it spread to two tractors and some goods carriers,” the SP said. A worker, Sukhalal, 55, was charred to death.

---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: Cut stamp duty to boost realty, urges industry||VISAKHAPATNAM: The Confederation of Real Estate Developers Associations of India (Credai) Andhra Pradesh chapter has urged the government to take steps to reduce registration stamp duty from 7.5% to 2% to help the real estate sector which is reeling under the impact of Covid-19. Credai also felt that shortage of skilled labour was a major concern in the state as over 40% of the skilled labour, who migrated to their hometown last year due to Covid-19 lockdown, is yet to return. Speaking to TOI, president of Credai, B Raja Srinivas, said stamp duty was reduced from 7.5% to 2% in 2009 when Y S Rajasekhara Reddy was chief minister and kept in force for two years in view of the global financial crisis. “The decision helped the real estate sector as buyers came forward to purchase flats and it pushed the growth of the economy. Now, we are urging the AP government to reduce stamp duty so that it would reduce the burden on buyers and push the growth of the real estate sector,” he added. Credai members said the reduction would help in raising sale of flats and associated products in the cities as well as the towns across the state, which, in turn, would increase GST revenue. “We are seeking the reduction for a period so that it will send a positive message to the market,” they added. Credai members also sought the rollback of the recent hike in the stamp duty on gift, partition, deeds and a provision for payment of building plan approval fees in four installments during the validity of the plan. The hike in prices of cement and steel has not only placed a burden on middle-class home buyers but also on builders. Cement prices rose by Rs 100 to Rs 150 a bag, resulting in an escalation in the cost of flats by Rs 200 to Rs 300 per square foot while price of steel increased by Rs 30,000 a tonne, leading to an increase in flat prices, said Credai members.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/cut-stamp-duty-to-boost-realty-urges-industry/articleshow/81739040.cms||Nalla.Babu
---||Hyderabad||New protocol: Telangana health department lets off steam||HYDERABAD: Amid spurt in Covid-19 cases, health department officials have issued fresh treatment guidelines with latest protocols to doctors. As part of the guidelines, asymptomatic patients would be given vitamins and simple antibiotics, if needed. They would be advised to isolate at home, but would be asked to have pulse oximeter with them to monitor their oxygen level in case they start to display symptoms. Another important guideline is not to advise patients for steam inhalation as many have been thinking that the process would help them clear the virus. “On the contrary, scientifically speaking, in Covid-19, lungs will become stiff when hot steam reaches them,” director, medical education, Dr Ramesh Reddy said. Though there have been divergent outcomes from different studies, he added. Dr Ramesh Reddy said the current wave of Covid cases was only due to negligence of people not wearing masks and flouting social distancing norms. Patients would not be given hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), but those who need treatment would be given Remdesivir and only in serious cases, prescribed steroids. The doctors were cautioned about spike in sugar levels in diabetic patients, who receive steroid treatments. They have been asked to keep them under monitoring for a long time. The recovered elderly patients also would be under monitoring for a long time. Health department officials have directed hospitals and doctors that serious patients with comorbidities should take their regular medicines. “In many cases, patients are hurriedly rushed to hospitals without their regular prescriptions. While undergoing treatment, it becomes difficult for treating doctors to continue their regular medicine regimen,” sources said. However, health officials said the number of people needing intense treatment and hospitalisation was much less than last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/steam-inhalation-harms-lungs-experts/articleshow/81740450.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The 5,000-kg yield of traditional paddy breeds are to be preserved by the conservation centre to enable agriculture students to research the characteristics of the traditional breeds such as drought-flood resistance qualities.The rarely-cultivated traditional paddy breeds such as Thulasi Vasanai, Seeraga Samba, Milagu Samba, Annamalagi, Ottadaiyan, Kala Namak and Navara were cultivated on five acres in Adirengam village. Since July 2020, despite the pandemic situation, traditional paddy revival enthusiasts were planting 100 types of traditional paddy varieties during the Samba cultivation period. Each of the breed has a crop cycle of 60 to 200 days, and they were harvested soon after the paddy breeds completed their crop cycle. A fertile field in Adirengam village was partitioned to grow the least known breeds. “Despite heavy rain and gusty winds during the monsoon, all the breeds that had grown for four to six feet height survived. We completed harvesting the paddy breed with the longest crop cycle recently,” S Rajiv, organiser of the conservation institute, said.The yield of all breeds weighing 5,000 kg will not be utilised as food, but will be stored in kottai (a traditional seed storage box) to help the research students record the characteristics of the traditional breeds. The conservation centre said that the attempt was to revive the least known paddy breeds. “Nel Jayaraman had identified the traditional breeds after having field visits to various villages. We wanted to have adequate stock of paddy to prevent them from extinction,” Rajiv added. The traditional paddy breeds can be stored safely for one year, and a portion of the harvested paddy can be used as seed for the next crop cycle. Throughout the cultivation and harvest over a period of six months, machinery was not used.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/jayaraman-paddy-research-centre-harvests-100-traditional-varieties/articleshow/81740911.cms||Deepak Karthik

On Saturday, the CPM candidate of Gandharvakottai, M Chinnadurai, did exactly that to their amusement. A known face in the constituency, the 55-year-old candidate entered the village seeking votes riding a decorated white horse. In fact, a couple of hours before, the candidate himself was pleasantly surprised when his supporters told him they had arranged a horse for the day’s outing in the village. So there he was on horseback, followed by some 50-odd party members and people from alliance parties to the accompaniment of drums and crackers. Chinnadurai said he likes to be with the people and didn’t expect such an arrangement by his supporters. Villagers and children were taken by surprise over his arrival and many followed his trail. Saying that none had come to the village like this canvassing votes, S Malathi, a 40-year-old woman from the village, said Chinnadurai is a hardworking man who has been at the forefront of efforts to ensure their basic needs. On his part, the CPM candidate stressed on the need for youth to better their skills, and promised to bring a government polytechnic college to Gandharvakottai. He told voters that he would bring adequate supply of drinking water through the Cauvery scheme besides taking steps to desilt waterbodies. Steps would be taken to keep direct procurement centres open through the year so that farmers can sell their produce. He later campaigned in Marudankoilviduthi, Vandanviduthi, Ragunathapuram, Keerathur Keelangodu, Mannmadai and Odappaviduthi villages.

They hired the vehicle after coming to Nellore. After visiting Raghavendra Swamy Temple, Brahmamgari Matham and Srisailam, they headed back home in the same tempo traveller. Suresh Babu said the primary cause of the accident appears to be that the driver might have fallen asleep. The truck was parked at the extreme left side of the road near a fuel station. Drowsiness of the driver coupled with low visibility due to thick fog might have caused the accident, he said. The deceased were identified as Nanda Kumar (67), Maniratnam Jagadeesh (29), Saikrishnan Sujatha (50), Vasanth Asha (60), Damaramadugu Revathi (60) Subramanyam Sadgunadevi, Nandakumar Padmini, all from Chennai.

In the other accident in Krishna district, Gudlavalleru SI D Surya Srinivas said 12 people from Jinjeru village were heading to Pachubotlapalem for paddy harvesting work. While the exact cause of the accident is yet to be ascertained, it appears that the auto driver misjudged while overtaking the truck ahead of him and rammed into it. The impact was on the left corner of the truck. The driver of the truck is absconding and the auto driver was not able to speak. The injured were shifted to Machilipatnam government hospital.

---||Chennai||Desis abroad hit gym with online trainers from India, save big on time and money||CHENNAI: Kaarthika Thiruchelvarajan, a 32-year old dentist from Chennai, who had moved to Canada in 2019, hits the gym at home 8am every day along with her online trainer from India who logs in at 5.30pm IST. It’s a long-distance arrangement that has worked well for both of them as the trainee gets a cheaper deal and the trainer gets a foreign client.  Global fitness community F45 Training, which specializes in innovative, high-intensity group workouts said more than 20% of its online customers are overseas customers who enrolled in the programme during the lockdown when gyms became out of bounds. Sandeep Das, COO of F45 (India), said overseas customers find online courses offered by Indian trainers cheaper by 50% at Rs 3,000 as compared to $100 (Rs 7,500) paid for the same fitness program in the US and $150 in Singapore. Clients abroad go for the early morning slot or mid-day slot, which is 5.30 pm in Indian Standard Time or late night post 10 pm, says Kaushik Shankar, head of one of the F45 studios in Chennai. “Among several advantages in training under an Indian is that one can avoid paying any transaction or transfer fee as parents in India will make the payment. We also benefit from trainers who understand and work around our Indian diet and metabolism. This helps new immigrants like me,” says Kaarthika. During the pandemic, fitness companies and yoga centres in India are reaping the benefit of huge demand for online classes. This may also become a behaviour that could stick with the consumers post pandemic considering the flexibility it offers for customers to pay fee in Indian rupees, helping them save 50% to 60% for the same exercise programme. Srihari Sivaraj, founder of Fitkits, a non-gym fitness hub, says, “We have added over 200 overseas clients since the lockdown, and have more than 1,000 clients. Our workouts change every day and most of our clients are from the US, Singapore and the UK.” Fitkits charges about Rs 1,500 for a month for unlimited online training and works on a batch of four to five. Not just fitness centres, but Yoga businesses like Sarva Yoga’s—Sarva Live, where people can take live yoga classes at home from Indian instructors have seen over 150% increase from the previous year. Its founder Sarvesh Shashi says: “We saw a mad rush since people were locked in and were trying to improve their immunity and joined yoga classes. Group classes plus personal training are charged between $5 and $1,200. An individual who would otherwise pay $100, can now get the same training at $10 on our platform and can pay in Indian Rupee.” About 10% of the facility’s overall monthly active user base comprises overseas users.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/desis-abroad-hit-gym-with-online-trainers-from-india-save-big-on-time-and-money/articleshow/81740460.cms||Mamtha Asokan

Moreover, 70% of these are more than 20 years old. Karnataka tops the list among states with approximately 70.1 lakh 15-year-old plus vehicles, followed by Uttar Pradesh having nearly 56.5 lakh such vehicles, according to government data. The details submitted by Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari to the Parliament last week show that at least four crore vehicles registered across states are more than 15 years old and nearly 50% of these are older than 20 years. The actual number would be more since this number has been collated from the digitised vehicle data from the central vehicle registration database of Vahan 4. Moreover, the centralised data doesn't include the details of three big states - Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Telangana. The details of these vehicles become important in the light of the government's announcement to mandatorily de-register old vehicles - 15-years-old commercial and 20 -years-old personal vehicles - if they fail to pass the fitness test from June 1, 2024. "Currently, there is no mechanism to de-register vehicles until and unless the owners approach RTOs. So, there may be huge number of unused vehicles which are still in the category of registered vehicles," said an official. In its bid to discourage people to hold on to their old vehicles, the government has started taking a series of steps including the move to formulate guidelines for imposition of "green tax" on older vehicles by states and UTs. The road transport ministry has circulated the proposal to states and UTs for their comments. It has also issued draft notifications to increase the charges for renewal of registration of personal vehicles and fitness renewal charges for commercial vehicles which are over 15 years. "I'm wondering what could be the reaction of the government on 15-year-old private petrol vehicles that are very well maintained and so would pass the pollution test with flying colours. This proposal is overlooking a sizeable chunk of vehicle owners who fall in this category," said Geetika Dogra, a vehicle owner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/delhi-has-3rd-highest-share-of-15-year-old-vehicles-in-india/articleshow/81741002.cms||Dipak K Dash

Telangana Congress president and Nalgonda MP N Uttam Kumar Reddy has written letters to the CPI and CPM state secretaries Chada Venkat Reddy and Tammineni Veerabhadram respectively and also spoken to them over phone. Leaders of Left parties will meet in a day or two to discuss whether to extend support to Congress or field their candidates in the by-poll, a CPI leader said. The Congress has fielded its seven-time legislator K Jana Reddy from the constituency. CPI was part of the grand alliance of Congress-TDP-Left and TJS in the 2018 assembly elections. The CPM was not part of the alliance, which was disbanded after the elections. There after, there was no electoral understanding or tie up between the Congress and Left parties in Dubbak by-election followed by GHMC polls. Even in the recent elections to the two graduate MLC constituencies, CPI and CPM had jointly fielded Jayasaradhi Reddy from Nalgonda-Warangal-Khammam seat. The Congress had fielded S Ramulu Naik. The ruling TRS candidates won both the MLC constituencies by defeating the BJP’s sitting MLC Ramchander Rao from Hyderabad-Ranga Reddy-Mahbubnagar seat and retaining the Nalgonda-Warangal-Khammam constituency. The by-poll to Nagarjuna Sagar assembly constituency is on April 17 and counting of votes on May 2.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/congress-seeks-support-from-left-for-sagar-poll/articleshow/81740461.cms||Roushan Ali

This, courtesy a flurry of projects set to spring up along the IT corridor over the next four-five years which are all racing to tower past the 40-floor mark. Most are even hoping to walk home with the ‘tallest building in the city’ award. In February this year, Bengaluru-based Sumadhura Group hit headlines after its 44-floor residential venture in Financial District got the green signal from civic authorities. Expected to be ready by 2025, ‘Sumadhura Olympus’, is being marketed as Hyderabad’s tallest property in the making. But until it takes off, it’s home-grown Rajapushpa Properties’ ‘Provincia’ in Narsingi that’s hoping to hold onto that title. Standing at G+39 floors, this project is already underway and has sold most of its top floors, say, officials – a base price tag of Rs 6,549 per square feet (sft) notwithstanding. “There is tremendous demand for the top floor, especially those above the 30th floor,” said P Sreenivas Reddy, executive director of firm, adding, “Our reason to go vertical was to have more open space around the project and that’s possible only if the building is above a certain height,” he added. For Candeur Constructions though, the idea was to grab maximum attention with their debut show in Hyderabad. While their projects in their home ground, Bengaluru, are limited to 24 floors, the ‘Candeur 40’ in Miyapur will have 40 floors once it’s ready by mid-2024. “Of the total 346 units that we have sold so far, majority are on the top floors and 3BHKS. People are very keen on buying bigger spaces in high rises now,” said Madhusudan Kilari, senior manager (sales). Agrees, officials of SAS Infra that’s currently building a 36 floor ‘iTower’ in Nanakramguda – touted as Hyderabad’s tallest commercial project thus far. According to market sources, the firm is drawing up plans to launch a 57-storeyed residential tower in the city soon, hoping for it to become the tallest housing project in all of south India. “These apart, there are a bunch of other projects in their nascent stages of planning, that are expected to be 40 floors and above. All of them are planned in Hyderabad’s western wing and priced at Rs 6,500 to Rs 7,000 per sft (on an average),” said a leading city realtor. Civic officials maintain that only some buildings have been given permission so far. “Most permissions being sought within the core city area are still limited to 30-32 floors. It is projects in the periphery that are gunning for 40+ structures,” said Devender Reddy, chief city planner, Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/skys-the-limit-for-flats-in-city-as-builders-race-to-build-40-floors/articleshow/81740914.cms||Sudipta Sengupta

In some nondescript areas of the district, these students at zilla parishad (ZP) primary schools are being inculcated the habit of reading newspapers for enhancing their overall mental abilities and intellectual development. And, it won’t be a surprise if, riding on better information through newspapers than fake news on social media, one day these students put forward a major challenge before their urban counterparts. “We organize an array of activities revolving newspapers, ranging from making subject-wise collections of news article cuttings to keeping a newspaper stand at the school fpr students. We also ask some of them to pick printing mistakes in newspapers,” Smita Dongre, an assistant teacher and also holding the additional charge of headmistress at her Mangli ZP Primary school at Champa in Umrer taluka, said. She said she bears the expense of buying newspapers and don’t bill them to the school treasury. “There is a display board where all the important news and events from newspapers are put on display for students to read them in the morning and later in the day we ask them to recall. A group is also engaged in finding out printing mistakes in newspapers which can only be done if they attentively reads across the broadsheet,” she said. Archana Bhovate, an assistant teacher at ZP primary school at Shiva near Bazargaon, said she managed to generate several collections of newspaper cuttings on various subjects which are accessed by students for knowledge. “These students are so motivated to find out an important article in newspapers that they even try to trace them in old and abandoned newspapers too and even if they had come from a grocer’s shop,” she said. She said the basic aim is to develop reading and writing skills among students in their formative years itself, remain updated with current affairs and general knowledge and, most importantly, grow a love for newspaper as a medium of authentic information in absence of libraries and other similar options.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/teachers-inculcating-reading-habits-among-rural-students-through-newspapers/articleshow/81740481.cms||Soumitra Bose

While this is lower than the normal saturation levels of 98%-99% in healthy humans and 96% in smokers and people with asthma, majority of these cases can be dealt with high level oxygen supply set-up in an ICU. However, persistent low-grade fever is emerging to be the most common symptoms among patients now. Nearly 65% of the overall cases landing at the King Koti Hospital and the Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences (TIMS), Gachibowli fall in this category of patients. “A few of these are also coming with scarring of lungs but majority are reporting with low grade fever, giddiness and other varied symptoms. Previously, majority of cases came with pneumonia and scarring of lungs and others had loss of smell and taste as common symptoms,” said Dr Marri Mallikarjun, nodal officer, Covid isolation centre, King Koti hospital. The fever is being observed for 7-10 days before patients report at the centres and are found positive. Also, unlike earlier when majority of the severe cases were found to be of people above 60 years of age, currently most cases are being seen in the 30s and 40s age group. “Now the trend being seen is that most admissions in the hospitals are of younger age groups which is a bit worrisome despite the fact that the severity of cases is low.

The industry players have demanded that the inlet effluent discharge norm be increased to 500 & 1,000 mg/ltr of COD for coastal and deep-sea respectively. The issue was raised at a webinar organized by the CPCB with stakeholders of the Common Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP) across the country on Friday. The purpose of the meetings was to assess the performance and issues faced in the management and operating CETPs.The industry representatives claimed that current discharge norms were not achievable. They said that various studies conducted to assess the impact of high COD in deep-sea and coastal areas had found that dilution in the deep-sea, especially in the Gulf of Cambay was very high. They further asked the union ministry of environment and forests (MoEF) to change the norms to something that is achievable. Most of the effluent from Gujarat-based chemical industries is discharged into the Gulf of Cambay and no adverse effect has been observed in the past 20 years, claimed industry players from Bharuch and nearby industrial estates.They brought to the notice of CPCB that several state pollution control board including the one in Gujarat and industrial associations had made earlier made representations to relax norms for deep-sea and coastal discharge.Subsequent to which studies were also carried out by various agencies including the National Institute of Oceanography (NIO), National Environment Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) and Central Salt & Marine Chemicals Research Institute (CSMCRI). The industry players claimed that three institutes observed that there was no degradation of the environment the Arabian sea at the proposed discharged points.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/bharuch-industries-urge-cpcb-to-relax-deep-sea-effluent-discharge-norms/articleshow/81739078.cms||---

According to Abhayam team officials, they received a call from an unknown person who saw a woman and a kid sitting under a bridge near Songadh town of Tapi district on Saturday evening. The woman looked distressed, so the informant called Abhayam team.“As soon as we received the call, our team reached out to the woman and tried to understand her problems. The woman revealed she used to live with her husband, who is an alcoholic, at a village near Uchhal taluka of Tapi district. Her husband used to fight with her after getting drunk and subject her to domestic violence. “On Saturday too, he picked up a fight with her. He forced the woman and the kid out their home and abandoned them under a bridge near Songadh town. She did not want to return to her husband.

During the heated exchange when the little boy asked his dad to play with him, the furious father, in a fit of rage, grabbed the child and smashed his head on the floor. The boy lay unconscious for a while even as the two grown ups continued to throw insults at each other. Little did the man realise that he had just "killed" his own son. The child suffered severe head injuries from internal bleeding. He was eventually taken to a private hospital where he slipped into a coma and later succumbed. A shocked mother registered a complaint against her husband on Sunday. And the father, identified as one Mohammed Naseem, has been booked for "culpable homicide". Naseem is a resident of Baradari locality and lives in a joint family. His brother and nephew were forcing him to sell the ancestral house and give them a share for "business". Naseem was firmly against it. The heated argument took place on Thursday and Naseem took out all his rage on his little boy, Hussain. Hussain was shifted to a private hospital where scans confirmed severe head injuries. He remained in a coma after suffering brain haemorrhage. “We have registered an FIR under section 304 [culpable homicide not amounting to murder] against the father. His wife lodged the complaint and wants immediate action. The child's body has been sent for autopsy. His father has been taken into custody. We are now waiting for the autopsy report. The statements of the family members will be recorded soon,” Baradari SHO Sheetanshu Singh said. A city-based psychologist pointed out that parents taking out their frustration on children is "common" and can be "very harmful". "Many a times, people take out their frustration on their children either by slapping or shouting at them without realising that it affects the mind," Shailesh Sharma, the psychologist, said. This incident suggests that the father must have thrashed his son in the past as well and fails to control his anger - which led to this tragic situation, Sharma added. "One should always refrain from beating their children. Stay calm, be nice to them," the psychologist said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/man-smashes-5-year-old-sons-head-during-heated-argument-with-brother-over-property/articleshow/81738603.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

However, police are yet to start their crackdown on people who are not using masks while being in public places. The government, in their order, directed the district collectors and commissioner/superintendent of police to strictly implement the usage of masks. On Sunday, the implementation by the police was not observed. At public places like Tank Bund, people were seen moving freely without wearing any masks. Similarly, in Madhapur, Gachibowli and other parts of IT corridor, Charminar and surrounding areas, violations by citizens not wearing masks were rampant. As of now, the enforcement has not started in any of the three commissioneratesPolice might conduct a campaign for a few days before they take up the enforcement. In the past, police booked e-petty cases and levied Rs 1,000 fine. If there is a mass congregation, then Disaster Management Act and section 188 of IPC will be imposed by police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cops-lax-in-mask-norm-enforcement/articleshow/81740476.cms||---

Those found violating Covid-appropriate behaviour will be challaned and may be arrested also,” said Arun Kumar Mishra, district magistrate (east), adding that teams of Delhi Police, too, will be present and there may be joint action as well, if required. Mishra said that those heading the teams will prosecute the violators. “People should celebrate the festival at home with their family. There is too much at stake and no one should risk their life due to celebrations,” he said. “Total 18 teams will be deployed in the district and my sub-divisional magistrates (SDM) will be out. Each SDM will control five teams and three teams will be under district headquarters,” said Vishwendra, district magistrate (south east). He said that enforcement teams have already been carrying out drives in the district, even though the general response regarding Covid-appropriate behaviour has been a bit low. “The drives have been a combination of persuasive arguments and challaning,” he said, adding that nobody is spared for violating Covid-safety norms. “We have deployed 16 teams that will be targeting all the super spreader areas, particularly areas that have traditional locations for public celebrations. Our teams will be mobile and take action wherever required,” a south district official said. “We have also been engaging ,as much as we can, resident welfare associations, market associations, community and religious leaders to help in ensuring that Covid norms are maintained,” he added. Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain had said on Saturday, “These festivals will come next year as well wherein one may celebrate it publicly.” “When 50 people meet and come in contact, out of these even if two are positive, the rest will test positive too. Such events must be avoided. Legal action will be taken against violators,” Jain had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/holi-celebration-in-public-places-will-cost-you-special-teams-keep-watch/articleshow/81740498.cms||Sidharatha Roy

Dr Vishesh Kumar Gupta came to know about it on Saturday when people started calling him and inquiring about his health. Gupta informed police about it. Moradabad police said that a case has been registered. Station house officer (SHO) of Majhola, Moradabad, Mukesh Shukla, told TOI, “The case has been taken over by the cyber cell. The process of tracing the hackers involved in the fraud has been started. And the account has been suspended.” Gupta also took to his Facebook account to inform people that his name and photograph were being misused. He said that a fake profile was created in his name with some ulterior motives and requested people not to accept any friend request or respond to any message. The UP chief of the child rights body told TOI, “On Saturday morning, I started getting calls from my friends and relatives who informed me about the messages being sent through a Facebook account, impersonating me.

The victims were coming to Roorkee to celebrate Holi with their friends when the accident took place. The victims were identified as Manish Kumar Surendra (31), a resident of Shamli (Uttar Pradesh), and Ashok Rajpal (27), a native of Hisar (Haryana). The accident took place at about 2 am. The speeding car first hit a road divider on Delhi-Roorkee national highway at Mandawali near Gurukul Narsan and then rammed into a truck parked at the road-side. “Soon after the accident, we rushed them to the Roorkee Civil Hospital where they were declared dead.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Rajnath Singh terms state’s judicial inquiry against Enforcement Directorate unconstitutional||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: On Sunday, Union defence minister Rajnath Singh termed the state government decision, to initiate judicial inquiry against enforcement directorate (ED), as unconstitutional and unfortunate. Addressing a news conference, Singh said LDF government’s decision to order a probe against the central agency, which is investigating the gold smuggling case, went against federal principles. “LDF and UDF should tell why Kerala failed to move ahead on developmental front, despite being the most-literate state in India. LDF and UDF that rule the state in turn defeat the people of Kerala. They are in love in West Bengal. The Pinarayi Vijayan government has ruined the social balance in Kerala,” claimed Singh. The Union minister reached the capital on Saturday night to participate in NDA’s election rallies on Sunday. Singh alleged that LDF is trying to cheat people by giving them bogus promises. The minister said the state government cheated the fishermen by inking an agreement with a foreign company for deep-sea fishing. “It was Narendra Modi who established the fisheries department at the Centre. But Congress, the main opposition party, is yet to know this fact. Centre is planning to introduce fishermen cards like Kisan cards and is seriously considering a proposal to give them Rs 6,000/year,” he said. Singh said BJP was committed to implement all promises in the NDA manifesto and added that BJP’s commitment to promises was proved by the revocation of Article 370 and scrapping of triple talaq. He said state governments too should be ready to forego a part of fuel tax to bring down the fuel price. ‘Central agencies need govt’s consent’Meanwhile, CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury said no central agency can interfere in the affairs of the state unless there is a consent from the state government. Speaking at a meet the press programme on Sunday, he said minister Rajnath Singh must study the Constitution first before criticizing the state government for ordering a judicial probe against ED officials. On the Sabarimala women-entry issue, Yechury said the case is pending before the Supreme Court. So, there is no need for discussing an issue which is sub-judice. The party will inspect under what circumstances devaswom minister Kadakampally Surendran expressed regret over government action on women-entry at Sabarimala, he said. UDF and BJP are trying to distract public attention by levelling baseless allegations. There is a deal between Congress and BJP in state. The statement of BJP state president K Surendran that the party will come to power if it gets 35 seats hints at this tie-up.  The recent statement by BJP leader O Rajagopal that he got Congress votes from Nemom in 2016 proves the hidden tie-up, Yechury said. “What is BJP planning to do in seats where it has no candidates?” he asked. Yechury also flayed the election commission and asked it to be impartial and independent. The decision to freeze RS election was biased, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/rajnath-singh-terms-states-judicial-inquiry-against-ed-unconstitutional/articleshow/81739804.cms||---

---||Dehradun||We risk our lives on duty, Rs 2,000 monthly pay not enough: Uttarakhand’s gram praharis||Nainital: In April 2014, gram prahari Daya Kishan Pandey caught two men carrying guns and gas cutters trying to rob a bank in Haldwani’s Gaula Par area and chased them to Kathgodam, armed only with his licensed revolver. The robbers were arrested the next day at Kathgodam Railway Station. For nine years, as a gram prahari, Pandey has been the first responder to all sorts of mishaps. His job involves tipping off police about crimes, helping them trace drugs, etc. When the Covid pandemic broke out, Pandey recorded details of every person coming from outside. Along with several other gram praharis, Pandey has written to authorities including MLAs, the chief minister and even the Prime Minister, for an increase in pay, but to no avail. The monthly pay of gram praharis in Uttarakhand is currently Rs 2,000. It used to be Rs 1,200 for gram praharis in revenue areas and was increased to Rs 2,000 just this month. “The monthly pay of gram praharis should be increased to at least Rs 10,000. We live with the stigma of being a police informant, putting our lives at risk to protect others but we have to rely on other professions to earn a living,” said Pandey. “We are the ones to inform police and district administration about whatever happens in villages. When the pandemic was at its peak, we ensured precautions were maintained. We put ourselves in constant danger for monthly salaries that are less than daily wages,” said Harish Ram Arya, another gram pahari. Pandey added that on top of low pay, there was no provision in the contract of gram praharis for their families to receive benefits should they die while on duty. “We are the people at the frontlines, dealing with robberies and drug-related crimes. In fact, many praharis have died helping people during disasters. However, there is no provision to help our families in the event of our death on duty,” said Pandey.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/we-risk-our-lives-on-duty-rs-2000-monthly-pay-not-enough-uttarakhands-gram-praharis/articleshow/81739194.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Kochi||Allegations of vote trade in an ‘unguarded’ Left fort||Malampuzha: Though the name Malampuzha evokes the images of the picturesque dam, suspension bridge, cable cars and Kanayi Kunjiraman’s Yakshi, the constituency is also home to the industrial town of Kanjikode, steeped in communist tradition. This is a citadel that guarantees any LDF leader a seat in the assembly, something even Kannur cannot guarantee. Malampuzha is a CPM fortress where the party has won every assembly election since its formation in 1967. It is this legacy that all LDF supporters are proud about but this time around the LDF citadel will miss veteran CPM leader and former chief minister VS Achuthanandan who represented the constituency from 2001- 2016 after he opted out of the race due to ill health. Other prominent figures elected from the high-profile constituency include former chief minister E K Nayanar (from 1980 to 1987), and former finance minister T Sivadasa Menon (from 1987 to 2001). The discussion is definitely not about Achuthanandan’s victory margin which had steadily increased in every election over the years. In 2016, he had won by a margin of 27,142 votes. But in the same elections, the BJP had come in the second position pushing the Congress to the third for the first time, surprising everyone in Malampuzha. This has given the confidence to BJP state secretary and former vice chairman of Palakkad Municipality C Krishnakumar to contest again from Malampuzha. Though CPM initially planned to field party secretary in-charge A Vijayaraghavan in the constituency, it finally zeroed in on VS aide A Prabhakaran for retaining the seat. Forced closure of industries due to strikes, man-animal conflicts leading to rampant destruction of paddy crops and deaths of farmers, drinking water scarcity and losses to dairy farmers are some of the key issues raised in the campaigns. UDF candidate S K Anandhakrishnan says several paddy and dairy farmers in the region have been facing huge losses and that the authorities have been neglecting the constituency though it has been rooting for such a high-profile MLA like VS for years. BJP’s Krishnakumar, the runner-up in the last elections, believes his party would put up a tight fight. “The Centre has lot of schemes that will benefit the constituency but because of the political attitude of the LDF, the constituency has not been able to benefit from them,” he says. “Though they keep saying there is no development and that the MLA has been “missing”, that contention is not right. Be it Nayanar or VS, all of them have looked after the constituency well,” says LDF candidate A Prabhakaran. A controversy had erupted after UDF allotted the seat to a Janata Dal splinter group led by advocate John John forcing Congress workers to raise protests. The party then took over the seat and fielded S K Anandhakrishnan, a former RSS man and BMS leader who joined Congress in 2001 as its candidate from the constituency. This has also led to the allegation that there is a tacit understanding between NDA and UDF to breach the CPM stronghold and handover a victory to NDA. But Prabhakaran says that even if there is a secret understanding to transfer some Congress votes to BJP, they cannot defeat the LDF in its bastion. In the recently-held local body polls, out of the eight grama panchayats, the LDF had won seven while Elappully went to the UDF. In the last Lok Sabha election, LDF had secured 20,000 more votes than UDF and in the local body elections, the margin increased to 22,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/allegations-of-vote-trade-in-an-unguarded-left-fort/articleshow/81739807.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

Police said that Sikandar Kasam Shaikh (28) stabbed his 25-year-old brother Haroon repeatedly with a scissor in a fit of rage after a heated argument over managing the shop located at Stand Chowk in Jetpur. Police sources said that the brothers had been at loggerheads for the last couple of months over various issues ranging from domestic chores to managing their shop. On Sunday evening, while making a garland at the shop, they started arguing over work-related chores. As the altercation escalated, Sikandar allegedly stabbed Haroon with the scissors he was using. Police said that while a couple of stabs were superficial, one in the chest seemed to have punctured the lungs, resulting in his death on the spot. Based on the complaint filed by their father Kasam Shaikh, police detained Sikandar who will be formally arrested after Covid-19 test. Meanwhile, police have sent Haroon’s body for postmortem.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/florist-stabs-younger-brother-to-death-with-scissors-in-shop/articleshow/81739203.cms||---

The caseload at the hospital, meanwhile, is set to increase further with cases being redirected to the hospital from districts, said experts. With this, the TIMS hospital, which was developed as an exclusive Covid ward months after the pandemic hit, is preparing for a further upswing in cases. While the hospital current has 200 inpatients and is seeing another 250 outpatients, the bed strength at the hospital kept ready for tackling more cases is 1,200. Senior residents at the hospital, however, fear that with an increase in cases, the hospital is likely to become yet another epicentre of the spread like several hospitals turned out to be epicentres during the first wave. “As the cases are increasing, our colleagues have started getting infected again. The fact that this time Gandhi Hospital is not taking non-serious cases and the Chest Hospital is not admitting any Covid case means most of the cases will be redirected to us,” said a senior resident, pointing out recent instances of doctors getting infected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covid-19-cases-at-tims-rise-doctors-face-increasing-risk/articleshow/81740493.cms||---

All started after a section of people booed at Kerala Janapaksham candidate P C George while he was speaking at two places in Erattupetta last week. Following this, George had declared that he will not campaign further in Erattupetta to avoid violence. Shone George, son of P C George, on Sunday alleged that LDF candidate Sebastian Kulathungal has come up with a false complaint against him to liven up the Left camp which has been inactive. He said the fake news about two Left workers injured after being hit by his car was intended to provoke the Left workers. He said both the individuals who were in an inebriated condition had lost control of the two wheeler they were riding and rammed his vehicle. The bike went further after hitting his car and fell into a pit. He also said he along with local residents had taken them out from the pit and had sent them in an autorickshaw. He also said legal action will be taken against Kulathungal for organising people by providing them liquor which leads to such accidents. Kulathunkal had earlier given a complaint to the election commission alleging that P C George has been indulging in character assassination by raising false allegations against him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/poll-campaignsin-poonjar-turnugly-over-falseallegations/articleshow/81739810.cms||---

Both the parties are expected to announce their candidate on the occasion of Holi (March 29). While Congress has shortlisted two candidates, six members of the BJP are in the fray for the party ticket. The core group of the BJP has finalised six names — Mahesh Jeena, Dinesh Mehra, Yashpal Rawat, Pratap Singh Rawat, Radha Raman and Girish Kotnala — for the party ticket. Meanwhile, block pramukh Vikram Singh Rawat, son of Ranjeet Rawat (two-time MLA from the seat), and Ganga Pancholi, who lost the last election by 2,904 votes, are also among the top contenders for the party ticket. On the other hand, the Congress may change its strategy and go with a heavyweight candidate if the BJP fields CM Tirath Singh Rawat as its nominee. Congress vice president Suryakant Dhasmana told TOI, “Our reason for delaying the announcement is to confirm whether the CM is contesting or not. If CM Tirath Singh Rawat contests from Salt, we will field a heavyweight. Otherwise our team of observers has already given us the list of shortlisted names.” BJP vice-president Devendra Bhasin claimed that “party nominee will be announced in a day or two”. The polling for the Salt constituency seat in Almora district would be held on April 17 and the votes would be counted on May 2. The last date for filing nomination papers is March 30 and the papers would be scrutinised on March 31. The candidates can withdraw their names by April 3. The bypoll was necessitated after the death of BJP MLA Surendra Singh Jeena (51) who had succumbed to coronavirus-related ailment. He was undergoing treatment at Sir Gangaram Hospital in Delhi and breathed his last on November 12, 2020. A total of 95,000 voters are expected to participate in the Salt by-election. According to the voter list prepared on January 1, 2021, the total number of voters in Salt is 95,241, of which 48,682 are men and 46,559 are women. The constituency has been won by Ranjeet Rawat of Congress in 2002 and 2007 and by BJP’s Surendra Singh Jeena in 2012 and 2017.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/with-barely-two-days-left-for-nominations-for-salt-bypoll-both-congress-and-bjp-are-in-wait-and-watch-mode/articleshow/81739205.cms||Kautilya Singh

According to Pembilai Orumai president Lissy Sunny, the central committee meeting called on Sunday at Munnar made the decision. "The members are free to decide whom to support but Pembilai Orumai will not support any front in Devikulam constituency," Sunny told TOI. The collective had earlier decided not to field candidates under its banner. Some of its members who won the local polls at the block and grama panchayat levels had later joined other political parties. According to Sunny, Pembilai Orumai has committees in 16 tea estates in the Munnar region. Now the collective is mainly concentrated on the welfare of plantation workers. Another popular face in the Orumai circuit, Gomathi Augustine, is not in the electoral scene this time. Augustine was one of the faces of the collective earlier, but she has moved on. "I had earlier decided to contest as an independent candidate in Devikulam. But cases in my name stood as a hurdle and hence I decided not to contest. I and my followers will support Congress candidates this election," she said. In 2015, the historic women workers' protest had rocked the plantations in Munnar for one-and-half months. Women workers in the tea plantations had demanded decent wages and better living conditions. That protest had led to the emergence of Pembilai Orumai. The collective grew into a force and its secretary Rajeshwari even contested under the banner in Devikulam in the previous assembly election. But later, internal rifts seriously affected the smooth functioning of the organization. Now, there isn't an active presence of the movement, and workers are backed by their former organizations.

With this, the cumulative cases of the virus shot up to 99,881 and the active infections reached 1,600 in the Himalayan state. Earlier on January 1, the state had recorded 361 Covid-19 positive cases. Among those tested positive for the virus on Sunday were 25 staffers of Taj Rishikesh Resort and Spa. In the last five days, a total of 82 staffers of the five-star hotel have tested Covid-19 positive. Talking to TOI, Dr Jagdish Joshi, additional chief medical officer (ACMO), Tehri, confirmed that 25 staffers of the hotel tested positive for coronavirus on Sunday while 22 other staff members were found to be infected on Saturday. “Around 35 staffers of the hotel tested Covid-19 positive on Thursday and Friday. So far, we have tested around 200 people for Covid-19 in the hotel. Among these, 82 have been found to be infected with Covid-19. We also conducted antigen tests of the six guests staying in the hotel. They all tested negative for the virus,” added Dr Joshi. The Tehri district administration, last week, had announced shutting down the hotel for 48 hours for sanitisation. However, a TOI source in the health department has said that the hotel officials are not cooperating in getting their contacts tested for the virus. “We have been asking the hotel staffers about the health conditions of their contacts. However, a majority of them sidestep our queries saying their kin are down with fever and hence, remain confined to their rooms,” added Dr Joshi. According to the health department data, 7,627 samples tested negative for coronavirus on Sunday. “Among the new cases, the maximum of 167 were recorded in Dehradun, followed by 59 in Haridwar, 54 in Tehri, 31 in Nainital, 17 in Pauri, 20 in Udham Singh Nagar, six in Uttarkashi, four in Rudraprayag, three each in Almora and Pithoragarh and two in Bageshwar,” said Abhisek Tripathi, officer of Covid-19 control room. The infection rate was recorded at 4.5% in the state. However, observers say that the state has reduced Covid-19 testing considerably in the last one week even as new cases continue to rise.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/highest-1-day-spike-in-covid-cases-recorded-in-ukhand/articleshow/81739236.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Dehradun||A century & half after her death, inns built by Darma valley's Jasuli Devi finally being restored||NAINITAL: A century and half after Jasuli Devi – a widowed philanthropist from Pithoragarh’s Darma valley – built over 300 inns on major trade and pilgrimage routes, the tourism department of Almora is in process of restoring one of them just 20-km from district headquarters. The department has brought in artisans from Rajasthan and is now planning to develop a homestay as well as a café in the vicinity to promote tourism and showcase the heritage and history of Uttarakhand’s Kumaon region. Rahul Choubey, tourism development officer, Almora, told TOI that the renovation cost the department around Rs 5 lakh and the aim of the project is to boost heritage tourism in the region. “Not many are familiar with the story behind these inns that dot major trade routes of Kumaon. So, we have started the pilot project. Though the basic works are complete we will work on additional work and the area will be open to tourists soon,” Choubey said. Meanwhile, Kumaon commissioner Arvind Hyanki told TOI that based on the response of the pilot project, the government will decide on renovating or restoring other inns across the region as well. “We need to preserve this heritage and so we have restored the inn in Almora. We are aware that several more of these exist in the entire Kumaon. And depending on the response we get from the present project, we will work on them,” Hyanki said. Historians as well as members of the Rung community to which Jasuli Devi belonged say that these inns were built around 12 km from each other so that the traders travelling on foot can cover the distance in a day. Ravi Patiyal, a scientist and a member of the Rung Kalyan Samiti, told TOI that though oral history suggests that over 300 such establishments were built by Jasuli Devi, but many of them have been demolished, overtaken or are in such bad condition that they cannot be identified. “However, over the last two years we have documented over 130 of these inns. Though they are spread over a vast geographical area from Terai to Tibet, their structure and style is the same,” Patiyal said. Ajay Singh Rawat, a Nainital based historian said that the story behind why Jasuli Devi donated to construction of these inns is one of the most sacred, prominent and cultural observances of the Rang or Shauka community. Devi, it is said, lost her husband and only son at a young age. “When she was performing the obsequies of her offspring, ‘Shradha’ (Gwan in local parlance), she became frustrated with life and decided to part ways with her riches. It is also said that in desperation she wanted to throw all her money in the river Dhauli. When she was about to commit the act a British official who knew about her generosity passed by and on witnessing her plight advised her to use the money for a better use,” Rawat said. Rawat added that several ponies and goats carrying Jasuli Buri’s riches followed the British official, who with that money built ‘dharamshalas’ for the Shauka traders and pilgrims across the region. “Unfortunately, with each passing year people of Uttarakhand are losing touch with history and have forgotten Jasuli Devi - the epochal figure of Uttarakhand,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/a-century-half-after-her-death-inns-built-by-darma-valleys-jasuli-devi-finally-being-restored/articleshow/81739234.cms||Prashant Jha

Some of these are likely to be auctioned off or scrapped, minister for transport Mauvin Godinho said in a written reply to a question tabled by Curtorim MLA Alexio Lourenco Reginaldo at the ongoing assembly session. With 18 buses, the Margao depot has the highest number of vehicles unused for over 12 months. Nine vehicles at the Panaji depot, five at the Porvorim depot and one at the Vasco depot haven’t been used. Similarly nine vehicles are lying unused for over a year at the central KTC workshop. The model number of these vehicles show that they were manufactured a decade ago and majority of them were manufactured between 2011 and 2013. Only four buses were manufactured between 2015 and 2016. Two of these are the oldest buses in the fleet dating back to 2003 and 2004. All five from the Porvorim depot and six buses from the KTC central workshop are proposed to be scrapped or auctioned. The remaining have been given a time frame of about a month to six months for repairs. “The commencement timelines to auction these vehicles will be taken after a resolution is passed by the board,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/42-buses-lying-unused-with-ktc-for-a-year/articleshow/81740553.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Konda working to form alternative regional party||HYDERABAD: In less than a fortnight after distancing himself from Congress, former MP Konda Vishweshwar Reddy on Sunday announced his plans to unite all smaller parties and strong independent candidates to form a formidable and viable regional party to take on chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao-led TRS in the 2023 assembly elections. The former MP, one of the richest politicians in the country, has already held first round of discussions with Telangana Jana Samithi president M Kodandaram and independent candidate Teenmar Mallanna. Though no tie-up has been assured, he said he has to work hard and hold several rounds of talks to convince the smaller parties and independents to come together to form a strong “alternate regional party” to TRS. “There is a need for a strong second regional party in Telangana on the lines of Tamil Nadu, which has DMK and AIADMK. The viable regional party should either tie up with either BJP or Congress in the elections or else TRS will benefit again due to division of anti-incumbency vote,” he said. If his efforts to firm up a strong regional party fail, he would decide his future course of action subsequently. “As on date, I am not keen on joining either BJP or YSRCP. My aim is to ensure that the anti-TRS vote is not divided. Though Teenmar Mallanna and Kodandaram got nearly 1.5 lakh and 1.03 lakh votes respectively in MLC election, they divided the anti-TRS vote, which helped the ruling party win the election,” he said. He would soon meet Cheruku Sudhakar of Telangana Inti Party and Jitta Balakrishna Reddy and Rani Rudrama of Yuva Telangana Party and other leaders of various other smaller parties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/konda-working-to-form-alternative-regional-party/articleshow/81740500.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Kochi||LDF has a two-faced attitude towards corruption: Thrikkakara MLA PT Thomas||From corruption allegations to cyber attack, incumbent Thrikkakara MLA PT Thomas opens up on a range of issues in this exclusive interview with TOI. Excerpts.The poll-surveys favour the LDF. Is Thrikkakara’s political scenario conducive to a UDF victory?I don’t believe in pre-poll surveys. I believe in the work done by my fellow men and the campaign has been going as scheduled. My political career has had several ups and downs. So even if I lose the election, I will continue my work among the people. In Thrikkakara, UDF will win with a better majority than last time. But I am thankful for the surveys as they have motivated my supporters. What are the highlights of your campaign?My campaign is mainly based on the development projects implemented over the last five years. But I also highlight the issues I want to address in the future. In many places in Thrikkakara, drinking water is available once every 3-4 days. The Oommen Chandy government had sanctioned a Rs 450 crore- project to resolve this but due to the laxity of the LDF government, it was not implemented. This will be completed. The Brahmapuram Sewage Treatment Plant is yet to become a reality. Palarivattom-Infopark metro and Vytilla-Infopark water metro, Thammanam-Pulleppady Road renovation, pending works of Sea Port-Airport Road, the construction of Thudiyoor-Eroor bridge, a dialysis unit for the poor patients in the constituency, etc are other issues I want to focus on. You have alleged that the Kitex Group is polluting the Kadambrayar River that flows through your constituency. How do you plan to tackle it?The waste from the textile factories of Kitex Group that backs the Twenty20, in Kizhakambalam is a major reason for the pollution of Kadambrayar. The unprocessed chemical wastes from the mills directly flow to the river, affecting almost all major water bodies in Thrikkakara. The public was unaware of this until the 2020 LSG polls when one of the Twenty20 leaders blurted it out. The pollution of Kadambrayar is an important issue and I will launch a legal fight against this. You have accused the LDF candidate of cybercrime and unhealthy campaign practices. What was the issue?When we search for P T Thomas in Google, a link to a website will appear. The title says ‘PT Thomas - Vote for LDF candidate’ and when clicked, the profile of the LDF candidate J Jacob opens. LDF is engaged in an unhealthy practice in the election by misusing the digital platform against me and it is a cybercrime. I have filed a complaint with the election commission, police, and district collector. I expect more decency from the LDF candidate, who is a doctor by profession. The LDF is using the controversial Palarivattom flyover that is in your constituency as a campaign tool. How do you look at it?Palarivattom flyover will not affect the election in Thrikkakara. Around 76% of the work was completed by the UDF government and the remaining 24% was done during the present LDF government. The RBDCK found structural issues within one month of its inauguration but the government delayed action to use it as a political tool in the election. If there is corruption, the culprits must be brought before the law but using the issue as a political tool is not acceptable. A portion of the Cochin Cancer Research Centre at Kalamassery collapsed in 2019 but the LDF government is yet to take action. Similarly, a PWD assistant engineer reported some structural issues with the Vytilla Bridge but all the details were suppressed. The LDF has a two-faced attitude towards corruption for political motives. Corruption allegations were raised against you too. You allegedly fled the scene of an Income-tax raid that seized Rs.50 lakh of unaccounted money.I won’t deny the fact that I went to that location before the raid happened. But I went there to mediate a land deal for the family of late CPM leader Dineshan. I intervened when the family sought my help saying they don’t have anywhere else to go. CPM branch secretary and ward councilor too were with me. But political opponents tried to cook up stories just to tarnish my image. I did not flee from the house and the IT conducted a raid after I left. Before submitting my nominations I wrote a letter to the state police chief seeking details of police cases against me. There are nine cases and all those are for conducting protests during the lockdown period. There are no cases registered against me by any central agencies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ldf-has-a-two-faced-attitude-towards-corruption/articleshow/81739814.cms||Anantha Narayanan K

Interestingly, in Idukki assembly constituency, sitting MLA Roshy Augustine representing the Kerala Congress (Jose) faction in LDF is contesting against UDF candidate K Francis George of Kerala Congress (Joseph) faction. In the 2016 assembly election, George contested as an LDF candidate and Augustine UDF. While George switched to the UDF fold recently Augustine had joined LDF after Jose faction became part of it. Thodupuzha constituency too would witness direct battle between the two factions. K I Antony of Jose faction is contesting against P J Joseph of Joseph faction. Kerala Congress (Jose) faction district president Jose Palathinal said in Idukki and Thodupuza constituencies a major chunk of voters back KC(M). “After KC(M) joined LDF, the entire vote bank would come to our fold. In addition, Augustine’s 20-year-long personal relations would also be helpful.” “However, it’s a fact that farmers who lost crops in the 2018 floods didn't get adequate compensation. In Thodupuzha constituency both LDF and KC have strong vote banks and it will help our candidate Antony win,” Palathinal said. Meanwhile, Idukki DCC president Ibrahimkutty Kallar said in both constituencies there are more number of Congress voters and the party’s victory is unquestionable. Biju Joseph, a resident of Idukki, said large scale destruction during floods is the main poll issue being discussed in the constituency. “Most of the farmers and merchants didn’t get compensated and it would reflect in the election result,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/idukki-a-litmus-test-for-kerala-cong-factions/articleshow/81739833.cms||Sandeep Thomas

---||Kozhikode||Candidates’ personal taglines are trending||Kozhikode: Not just major political fronts, but even candidates are flaunting catchy taglines on posters, banners, photographs and other campaign collateral including social media. More than a short string of words, personal taglines of candidates have emerged as key pillars of their campaigns by encapsulating the entire campaign message and even making a contrast between the candidate and rivals. For instance, in Koduvally where IUML leader Dr M K Muneer is locked in a spirited contest with sitting MLA, Karat Razak, Muneer has adopted the personal tagline, 'Nalla Naleyude Nalla Paithrikam' (Good tomorrow’s good legacy) invoking his lineage as the son of former chief minister C H Mohammed Koya. Muneer's opponent Karat Razak has countered it with the tagline 'Virunnukaranalla, Nanmayulla Nattukaran' (Not a visitor, but a good native), affirming his local roots in the region, contrasting Muneer's as he has shifted from Kozhikode South to Koduvally this time. The candidates of all the three fronts in Kozhikode North constituency also sport catchy personal taglines with BJP leader M T Ramesh having the slogan 'Hridayathil M T', (M T in the Heart) referring to the pride of place of the constituency comprising the city centre of Kozhikode. UDF candidate KM Abhijith has the tagline with the wordplay 'Abhi Jayikkum, Abhimanamakum' (Abhi will win and make you proud) while the former mayor and LDF candidate Thottathil Raveendran has the slogan 'Kozhikodinte Urappu'. UDF candidate in Guruvayur has the tagline 'Nanmayulla Nadinu Nanma Niranja Sarathi' (A good leader for the land of goodness) while his opponent LDF candidate N K Akbar has the tagline 'Guruvayurinte Nalla Kalam Thudaran' (For the good times of Guruvayur to continue). According to Dr Prem Kumar, branding expert, and political commentator, the trend picked up from LDF's tagline during the 2016 election, LDF Varum Ellam Sheriyakum, (LDF will come and everything will be all right). “Personal taglines are serving the purpose of positioning the candidate and have emerged as a key political messaging tool.” While the taglines of LDF candidates are mostly revolving around the campaign line of the front Urappanu LDF (It's LDF, for sure), UDF and NDA candidates seem to be employing a diverse set of taglines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/candidates-personal-taglines-are-trending/articleshow/81739835.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||‘Can’t sell defaulter’s mother’s home’||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court has restrained the commercial tax officer from recovering tax by auctioning a bungalow owned by a defaulter’s mother after he passed away leaving behind unpaid value added tax (VAT). In 2019, Nirupaben Thakkar approached the high court seeking directions to the state government and the commercial tax officer that her bungalow in Shree Laxminagar Society in Naranpura should not be put up for auction. She said the charge created on the property for auction should be deleted. She contended that the property belongs to her and the government cannot recover the dues after her son Kamlesh Thakkar’s death by selling her property. Kamlesh Thakkar passed away in December 2010. He had VAT dues in the name of the family firm. The authority decided to recover the dues by selling off his property and created a charge on the bungalow under Section 57 of the Gujarat Value Added Tax Act. But the bungalow was solely owned by his mother. Though the authority came to know about the sole ownership of the woman in 2014, the charge was not deleted. This led the woman to move the HC. Her advocate contended that even for creating the charge under the GVAT Act, the authority was required to issue a notice under Section 42 of the Act. Without following this procedure, no notice for the auction of the property could have been issued. On March 4, the bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice I J Vora said, “Prima facie, it appears that there is nothing to indicate that the immovable property in question is the estate of the deceased.” The court, however, gave an opportunity to the government to point out how the property belonged to the deceased. The court also questioned whether the procedure as pointed out by the petitioner’s advocate was followed. On March 15, the government said that the commercial tax department could not gather any cogent material or any other evidence to even remotely indicate that Kamlesh Thakkar was a joint owner. Moreover, it was pointed out that in 2014, the commercial tax officer had written to the mamlatdar concerned in this regard highlighting that the property was solely owned by the woman.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cant-sell-defaulters-mothers-home/articleshow/81739834.cms||---

About 55 cases of pesticides adulteration were reported in 2020-21. Union minister of agriculture and farmers welfare, Narendra Singh Tomar, said: “Andhra has reported no cases of sale of spurious pesticides from 2014 to 2020. The government of Telangana reported that during 2020-21, a total of 55 cases of spurious pesticides have been reported.” The government of Telangana has reported to the ministry of agriculture that in all the cases, cheating cases have been filed against dealers and manufacturers. During 2014-2020, cases spurious pesticide have been reported by central insecticide inspectors in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. Central insecticide inspectors have initiated action under provisions of Insecticide Act, 1968 against the dealers/manufacturers of spurious pesticides. With respect to fertilizers, 41,038 samples were found as non-standard samples during 2013-14 to 2019-20.

---||Nagpur||Ram Madhav’s appointment in RSS: Rehabilitation or new assignment?||Nagpur: BJP leader Ram Madhav’s appointment as RSS’ Akhil Bharatiya Karyakarini Sadasya (All India Central Council member) is also being seen as a move to rehabilitate him. His case is being compared to that of Nagpur’s Sanjay Joshi, a RSS functionary who was made national executive member of BJP, but he quit following internal feuds. This ended Joshi’s career and he was not accommodated back in the RSS. Originally from the city, Joshi had been based in Gujarat BJP, and was active during the state elections post 2002 riots. There are theories that even Madhav enjoyed a strong position in the BJP till he fell out of favour. Madhav, unlike Joshi, has now been included in the RSS central council, bringing him back to his original organization. The other theory is that it’s a move to strengthen the RSS politically. “Madhav has the experience of working in North East and can also be useful in strengthening its position in the southern states. He hails from Andhra Pradesh,” said Dilip Deodhar, a Swayamsevak and an independent researcher of RSS’ affairs. Even Hosabale’s appointment as the RSS Sarkaryavaha marks a new beginning. Hosabale comes from the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP). At present, a large number of BJP leaders are basically from the ABVP, and Hosabale is expected to have an influence over such cadre, said Deodhar. Madhav’s utility is seen in building a strong base in southern India. The BJP was seen aggressively campaigning for the Hyderabad municipal elections with even national leaders like Amit Shah joining in. This is because the party wants to build a base in the south. The RSS already has a strong presence in the north, so Madhav may be useful in strengthening the Sangh Parivar in southern India, he said. Arun Kumar, the Prachar Pramukh who was instrumental in laying groundwork for abolition of Article 370, also has similar potential. Even his capabilities can be utilized in the coming days. With the changes, the RSS’ central committee too has politically able members like the BJP. The changes have been made with an eye on the 2024 elections, said Deodhar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ram-madhavs-appointment-in-rss-rehabilitation-or-new-assignment/articleshow/81739298.cms||Shishir Arya

People must disapprove of the money power and instead support NTK candidates to prove that people with good intent for development can also be elected to the assembly, he said at election campaigns in Ariyalur and Perambalur districts. “Whenever election approaches, the parties offer Rs 1,000 and Rs 1,500 cash to voters besides freebies such as mixie and grinder so that the voters can be kept in poverty. We should eliminate both DMK and AIADMK,” Seeman said at Perambalur. Claiming that Tamil Nadu is one of the top contributors to the GDP of the country, he accused the Union government of showing bias in sanctioning funds to the state. If the Union government is citing lack of fund for not paying the due share of Tamil Nadu in GST, he asked why the Modi-led government is announcing new welfare schemes for several thousand crores. “Having questioned the government, I am not afraid of any raids. They can search my house,” he added while praising Mamata Banerjee for standing up to the Centre’s alleged strongarm tactics. Accusing the Congress and BJP of selling public sector entities like railways and airports, he urged the people to teach national parties a befitting lesson. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/freebies-keep-people-always-poor-seeman/articleshow/81740946.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat Covid count crosses 3 lakh mark||AHMEDABAD: Gujarat on Sunday became the 13th Indian state to record 3 lakh cumulative Covid-19 positive cases. As the daily cases surge in the state, the analysis of every 1 lakh cases reveals an interesting pattern. It took 168 days for the state to record the first 1 lakh cases. The second 1 lakh cases took just 82 days, or 51% fewer days. But the next 1 lakh cases took 124 days, or 51% more days. The analysis of the 3 lakh cases also reveals the urban-centric nature of the pandemic. The four major districts — Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara, and Rajkot — accounted for 64% of the total cases and 84% of the total deaths. Thus, the mortality rate in these districts was 2% compared to 0.6% or less than one-third for the rest of the 29 districts. The analysis of each 1 lakh cases and the share of the four districts in cases and deaths reveals that Ahmedabad district had accounted for 32% of the state’s total cases in the first 1 lakh batch, which reduced to 23% in the last 1 lakh cases. Surat’s share remained the same at 21%, whereas Vadodara and Rajkot showed an upward trend — 8% to 14% for Vadodara and 5% to 11% for Rajkot. “Among each of the 1 lakh cases, the last 1 lakh cases (from 2 lakh to 3 lakh) recorded the highest cases (69%) and deaths (90%) at these four districts,” said a city-based epidemiologist. “While other districts have also reported a rise, the figure shows why we need to concentrate our efforts on urban areas.” The epidemiologist added that factors such as higher concentration of population and greater movement of citizens could be responsible for the higher number of cases. But experts also pointed to the much lower testing in districts excluding the four. According to the state health department, of the 1.32 crore tests carried out so far, 72.7 lakh or 55% were in the four districts alone. Thus, the test positivity rate (TPR) was 2.7% for these districts compared to only 0.2% for the rest of the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarat-covid-count-crosses-3-lakh-mark/articleshow/81740633.cms||Parth Shastri

The dogs of the K-9 (canine) squad of Gujarat police will be used for smell out stashes of cash concealed by corrupt officials. Gujarat anti-corruption bureau will soon start using the police dogs in cases of corruption and a proposal for the same has been sent to the state home department. “We have decided to use dogs that can smell currency notes and help ACB officers unearth spots where big wads of currency notes have been concealed,” said a senior officer. The officer said that this will also help in saving the time and expediting the procedure in the cases of corruption. “Like in cases of loot, murder and other offences, dogs can exactly trace the location of hidden stashes of cash after they are given the scent of different currency notes,” said an officer. After the home department gives the sanction, dog handlers, like forensic experts, will be called to the spot where a corrupt officer has been arrested, for further inquiry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/police-dogs-to-sniff-out-corruption/articleshow/81739838.cms||---

Nehru had termed it an attempt to defame him on Saturday. DMK MP and organisation secretary R S Bharathi has sought the intervention of the CEO and a thorough inquiry into the matter. He said the ruling party must be stopped “from indulging in such activities and a level-playing ground ensured to all parties in order to have a free and fair election.” A team of cops and election officials had searched all the14 police stations under Trichy city police limits on Saturday and allegedly seized about Rs 70,000 in covers in two police stations coming under Trichy west constituency. They conducted an inquiry with the six policemen to find out the source of the unaccounted cash. Sources said an advocate and four others were also involved in the issue and the police were said to have registered a case against them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/6-cops-suspended-over-cash-seized-in-trichy/articleshow/81740947.cms||Gokul Rajendran

---||Kozhikode||Opposition leader tried to mislead EC through lies: CM||Kozhikode: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan continued to target opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala over charges of trying to obstruct distribution of food kits and payment of welfare pensions in the state, and said that the opposition should remain so and shouldn’t turn into a vengeful side. Addressing media persons in Kozhikode on Sunday, he said that Chennithala tried to mislead the Election Commission (EC) by telling lies for obstructing food material distribution to people of the state. He said that the opposition should not consider distributing food kits and welfare pensions as doling out freebies and should consider it as providing people their rights. “The opposition leader has complained to EC in his letter that the state government was distributing social welfare pension for May in advance to influence voters. It is a lie. The government is not providing the pension for May. What is being provided are the pensions of March and April? Has the opposition leader got into such a situation that he cannot distinguish between March and May?” Vijayan said. On Vishu food kits being distributed early, Vijayan said that the food kits have been provided on a monthly basis to provide relief to the people in view of the Covid pandemic and the distribution arrangement for April was issued by the food and civil supplies department through an order dated February 16 itself. “We decided to give it in the first week of April, considering Easter as well. During Onam and Christmas festive seasons in 2020, the government had distributed food kits prior to the festival. It has nothing to do with elections,” he added. On the government distributing rice to students in the run-up to the polls after withholding it for months, he said that the first phase of distribution of rice meant for the mid-day meal scheme to students had been completed earlier. The government then decided to provide food coupons to students but didn’t proceed with it following apprehensions that it could be misused and so reverted to the practice of distributing rice. “The revised order was issued on February 20, much before the election dates were announced. The opposition leader should desist from repeatedly telling lies at least in matters concerning people’s lives,” he said. Responding to a question, Vijayan said that Sabarimala was not a major issue before the people of the state as regular affairs are going on in the temple without any hitches. “Nobody has any issues relating to Sabarimala temple now. It is not an issue before the state now. Many had tried to rake up the issue during the last local body elections but failed. Now also it is not getting much response,” he said. Vijayan said that Covid-19 vaccinations will be provided to those aged above 45 years from April 1 and 1.1 crore more people will be administered vaccines. Currently, 26 lakh people have been vaccinated in the state. Chennithala hits out at CM Chennithala said it was not the opposition which was playing politics over the issue, but the Left Front which had stopped distribution of rice for 6-7 months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/opposition-leader-tried-to-mislead-ec-through-lies-cm/articleshow/81739842.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

With only a week left for polling, none of the candidates in the fray has offered any concrete promise on utilising the Rs 77 crore market complex on the Trichy-Madurai national highway, which could pave the way for the infrastructure growth in the southern suburbs.Even during the pandemic, there has been a persistent demand to utilise the 10-acre complex that was completed in 2018 but the purpose of which is yet to be realised. In all, 19 commercial space blocks with a cold storage unit has been set up here, but Gandhi market traders refused to occupy the facility citing poor infrastructure. Ku Pa Krishnan, the AIADMK candidate of Srirangam segment under which the integrated market falls, was vocal in utilising the space till a few months ago. He even earned the wrath of Gandhi market traders for his efforts to relocate the market to Kallikudi. “All candidates are tight-lipped about their plans to utilise the market space. If the complex had started full-fledged operation or if was used for other needs, our locality would have received investments and better bus connectivity,” S Vignesh, an advocate from Kallikudi said.The opposition camps including DMK and AMMK too are yet to express their views on the market utilisation. “While Gandhi market will not change, our party will look at utilising the integrated market space in other beneficial ways,” a source in DMK said. Kallikudi villagers said candidates irrespective of political affiliation are afraid of losing the Gandhi market traders’ vote bank which falls under Trichy east segment. While the rest of the demands of Srirangam such as the new bus stand gets repeated attention in campaigns, Kallikudi market’s development plan is being ignored. “The market dispute is a sub judice matter, so we are not expressing any opinion,” a senior functionary in AIADMK said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/candidates-mum-on-kallikudi-market-fearing-traders-wrath/articleshow/81740948.cms||Deepak Karthik

She also alleged that he did not have sex with her for a year. In her FIR, the woman stated that the accused whom she married in December 2016, had also forced her to drink beer and gave empty beer tins to their two-year-old daughter to play. She stated in her FIR with Adalaj police that she had gone to Dubai with her husband in March 2017 where he used to beat her due to constant provocation by her in-laws. “My husband used to create ruckus after getting drunk. He used to beat me seeking dowry from my parents. He often drank beer and forced me to drink it even though I never liked it,” she said. “My husband also forcibly made my two-year-old daughter drink beer,” she stated. After he drank beer, he used to throw empty beer tins in front of her daughter and told her to play with them instead of playing with toys, she alleged in the FIR. “He used to taunt me about my delicate physical condition and did not even have sex with me for around a year,” she alleged. She said in the FIR that her husband did not give her money and even when she demanded money to buy medicines for their ailing daughter, he told her to get money from her parents’ place. She said that they returned to India from Dubai in March this year and he left her at her parents’ place. Later, her husband and in-laws fled to Dubai without informing her. “He left my home on March 25 afternoon and later went incommunicado,” she alleged. She suspected that her husband and in-laws would fly to UK from Dubai. Adalaj police registered a complaint of domestic violence against the NRI man and his parents and began an investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/woman-alleges-nri-hubby-had-deprived-her-of-sex/articleshow/81739843.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kerala assembly elections 2021: People of Pala are torn between choosing a candidate or a party||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: This assembly election, Pala voters are in a state of dilemma. They have to be very clear about their candidates and their political fronts while heading to the polling booth. The sitting MLA Mani C Kappan who is the UDF candidate from the constituency had won as LDF candidate the previous time.  Jose K Mani who is the LDF candidate was part of the UDF the previous time. The NDA candidate J Pramila Devi too had switched over to BJP from Congress, recently. The voters will have to either take a decision based on the individual or the political front while exercising their franchise. For Jose K Mani, son of late K M Mani, it will be a do or die political fight. Losing this election will not only affect the legacy of his late father but will also the future of Kerala Congress (M). “We are not looking at the political front he (Jose) is representing. We want Mani sir’s son to win,” said Satheesh, a painter by profession, while awaiting the arrival of his favourite leader at Pravithanam junction. The rising temperature and the Covid-19 scare have affected the overall campaign of all fronts, he added. Upon reaching the venue, Mani briefed about his contributions in the field of education. Eyeing the new and young voters, Mani said development in the education sector have been carried out keeping the future in mind. “I could turn Pala into an educational hub during my tenure as an MP. Hundreds of youngsters are passing out from these institutes yearly and they know the benefits of the development in the sector in Pala,” he said. Mani is hopeful that he can attract the new voters apart from the traditional LDF votes and those of Mani loyalists. However, LDF is more focused on criticizing Kappan for leaving LDF just ahead of election. “A person who had stood with LDF has cheated his own party and the front to contest here. He thinks he is powerful. But he did not realise that he had gained power from the collective work of LDF,” chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan had said during an election convention of Mani in Pala. Kappan, however, in a very short period, had worked hard as an MLA. “Kappan is easily accessible. We could walk into his house anytime,” said Varghese, a small-time farmer. Being a multifaceted personality and born in the famous Kappan family in Pala are certainly advantageous for Kappan. He adorns various feathers like a successful film producer, director of a box-office hit, an actor in more than 25 films, a state-level volleyball player and successful farmer. Kapen is very specific about what he has done in the 16 months as an MLA. “Rivals will not be able to block the powerful smashes of Kappan,” spoke Rahul Gandhi in Pala. At present, Kappan is busy campaigning about development activities worth Rs 462 crore that he has brought in the constituency in the short period. He also spoke about opening an MLA office in Pala for the first time in the history of the constituency. Meanwhile, BJP is eyeing at increasing their vote share in the constituency. They had initially planned to field P C Thomas of Kerala Congress here which would have made it an interesting battle. However, they finalized J Pramila Devi, a professor in English for 34 years, as their candidate. “Kerala which has a high literacy rate deserves a corruption-free governance. Our aim is genuine secularism. Favouring any one religion at the cost of other religious groups cannot be approved,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/people-of-pala-are-torn-between-choosing-a-candidate-or-a-party/articleshow/81739844.cms||Jaikrishnan Nair

The 59-year-old Pontiff of Sri Vaishnava Mutt started his campaign on Sunday while seeking votes for AIADMK-led alliance in the upcoming assembly election in Srirangam. Condemning the derogatory remarks on women, he said the same group had backed the people who insulted Sri Andal a few months back while referring to the poet Vairamuthu, who had courted controversy while speaking on Andal. He said Raja should apologize for insulting the mother of the CM. Voters should reject such people in the election and make way for the formation of a government that supports Hinduism, he said. Distributing pamphlets around Srirangam that points on 10 reasons for rejecting the DMK-led alliance, he asked people to vote for those who promise to save the Hindu region and its temples.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/a-raja-must-tender-unconditional-apology-says-mannargudi-jeeyar/articleshow/81740949.cms||---

Against Oman last week, India put in a splendid second-half showing to share the spoils. But up against the might of UAE – ranked 30 spots higher –the visitors were handed a reality check in an international friendly. Most of the damage was done by Ali Mabkhout, who scored a hat-trick. India should have been alert. After all, the striker is among the most feared in Asia and has been chased by Premier League and La Liga clubs in the past. UAE’s highest goal-getter, both at club and international level, struck twice in the first 30 minutes to give his team a 2-0 lead and then completed his hat-trick after the change of ends. Khalil Al Hammadi (64th minute), Fabio Lima (71st) and Sebastian Tagliabue (84th) also added their names to the scoresheet as UAE handed India their biggest defeat in recent times. India coach Igor Stimac will have plenty to think. The Croatian World Cup bronze medal winner made eight changes to the team that held Oman, and just like the previous game, this 11 too struggled to adapt to international football. UAE were at ease, enjoying a majority of the ball and making their opponents look terribly out of place. Until the half an hour mark, India were unable to stitch more than four passes together. UAE’s breakthrough came in the 12th minute as Fabio -- a Brazilian granted UAE citizenship last year – sent a long ball for Ali Makhbout who beat India’s off-side trap and finished with an audacious chip over onrushing goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu. UAE’s second was at the half an hour mark. It was Ali Makhbout who scored again, this time from the penalty spot after Adil Khan was adjudged to have handled Fabio’s attempt inside the box. There was never a way back for India in the second session, even though Stimac introduced substitutes and changed his entire midfield. Without any supply, Manvir Singh, the goal-scorer against Oman, had little role to play. The make-shift defence was tested throughout the game. Whatever they tried, didn’t work out. Three of the four goals in the second half stemmed from lapses as substitute Raynier Fernandes lost the ball, Adil failed to read the flight and Ashique Kuruniyan got dashed away. Gurpreet could only watch helplessly. India had just one attempt on goal late in the first half. Debutant Liston Colaco had done well to read Manvir’s run inside the box, but the striker’s attempt was thwarted by the rival goalkeeper. Even in a friendly, UAE showed who’s the boss. They had 31 attempts, 23 of them on target, and enjoyed 73 per cent ball possession. Whichever way you look at it, this Indian team was no match.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/uae-hand-india-a-reality-check/articleshow/81749427.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: ‘Segregating patients key to corona control’||AHMEDABAD: Scientists at a leading institute for occupational health in the city have once again put their weight behind the strategy of segregating patients with high Covid-19 viral load to slow the drastic spread of Covid infection and save lives. In a new study, scientists from National Institute for Occupational Health (NIOH) Ahmedabad have claimed that the cycle threshold value of RT-PCR tests, which indicates the viral load of a patient should be an integral part of the Covid management strategy. The research paper has been authored by NIOH scientists Bidisa Sarkar and Paramita Sengupta. People with low Ct value have high viral load and vice versa. Hence, Ct value of initial viral load of already diagnosed cases mandatorily be mentioned in each individual report for further management. “Individuals with high viral load are super-spreaders - they take the centre stage in person to person transmissions of coronavirus. This appears to be true as similar observations (few people spread most and most people spread few) were also made during severe acute respiratory syndromes (SARS) epidemics,” claims the paper. The paper states that in case of Covid-19 a 10% of all those infected with Covid-19 are responsible for spreading 80% of all local transmissions. The paper points to drop in cases achieved after Ct-based strategy was followed by Ahmedabad district administration since third week of June where cycle threshold-based segregation of laboratory-confirmed positive cases was adopted for home quarantine, institutional quarantine and hospitalization based on symptomatology. Apart from Ct-based segregation the scientists also pointed out that “Contact tracing of the previous five days of the cases with higher viral load is to be done rigidly considering as transmission starts on an average four to five days prior to first appearance of symptoms.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/segregating-patients-key-to-corona-control/articleshow/81740631.cms||---

Inspector Yuvrajsinh Vaghela of Ghatlodia police said that the accused has been identified as Meet Jethwa, 21, a resident of Swagat City in Adalaj in Gandhinagar. He studies in NHL Medical College in the Ellisbridge area. According to an FIR filed with Ghatlodia police on Sunday, a medical officer of the urban health centre in Ghatlodia, Dr Pavan Patel, 31, and his staff members were taking lunch on March 24 afternoon when the incident took place. Patel said that a staff member told him that an unknown man was putting boxes of corona kits inside a bag. Patel rushed to that place in the urban health centre and found the man striding out while carrying the bag filled with corona kits. When he tried to chase the man, he ran , sat in a parked car and drove away towards Sattadhar Circle. Patel later approached Ghatlodia police and filed a complaint of theft of 16 boxes of corona testing kits having a value of Rs 39,200. Each box had 25 kits which were meant for free testing at the urban health centre. As Patel provided the RTO number of the car, the cops could trace the accused. Vaghela said that Jethwa along with his friend, who is yet to be identified, had planned the theft. He said that Jethwa’s friend is an MBA and they wanted to sell those testing kits to earn money. After getting caught by the cops, Jethwa has been constantly expressing remorse. Police have sent him for corona testing before arresting him in the theft case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/mbbs-student-steals-test-kits-worth-rs-6-lakh-nabbed/articleshow/81740634.cms||---

He was campaigning for AIADMK-PMK alliance candidates fielded in constituencies in Ariyalur and Perambalur districts on Sunday.Seeking support for AIADMK candidate Thamarai Rajandran in Ariyalur, the PMK leader hailed the chief minister for facilitating internal reservation for vanniyars. He added that DMK instead of relying on its own functionaries has hired a political strategist to guide the party in the ensuing election. He criticised DMK deputy general secretary and MP A Raja for passing remarks on the chief minister. “DMK leader M K Stalin has not reprimanded his party’s deputy general secretary strongly for making an unpardonable remark. If such an incident had taken place in our party, we would have taken strict action,” he added.  “Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami has implemented many good programmes for the state. Even in the ensuing assembly election, he has announced promising schemes. People must ignore DMK and support AIADMK,” he said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/electing-dmk-will-bring-back-kangaroo-courts-anbumani/articleshow/81740950.cms||---

The CM said that public support for his government has grown hugely, making even the anti-government media houses unable to mask the ground reality. Excerpts:Your relation with media has never been smooth. But the same media now predict a second innings to your government, prompting the opposition to accuse media for being hand in glove with you. Your reaction.There is no friction with the media, I regularly interact with them and respond to their questions. When the people of Kerala are overwhelmingly supporting this government, it is difficult even for media houses that oppose us to mask the public sentiment, that’s all. Sabarimala has now become a hard nut to crack. What really is the assurance that you offer to devotees?The case is being reviewed by the honourable Supreme Court. After a verdict, we will discuss it with all those concerned and move forward accordingly. Can CPM and Congress oppose each other earnestly, since both stand as a single block outside Kerala, even in Tamil Nadu? We have been opposed to the Congress even during pre-independence era. In independent India, we have been their staunchest critics, especially on their economic policies and soft communal overtures. In Tamil Nadu the alliance is led by DMK against NDA; there the onus is on fighting communalism. And when the fight is between communal and secular forces, we are willing to cooperate with all secular and democratic formations. In 2016, V S Achuthanandan was LDF’s election mascot. Now, it’s Pinarayi Vijayan. How do you see the polls without an active VS? Both VS and I request the people’s support for LDF. Even when persons change, the politics remains. Ideas and issues are fought over in an election; it should not be reduced to merely a fight between individuals, or a fight spearheaded by the person leading a political party or formation. Communists generally oppose idolizing leaders and you too cautioned against giving too much importance to individuals. But your picture is widely used in the election campaign, making you somewhat an icon. How do you justify this?As I said, it is the politics that matters, not the person. I myself have cautioned about putting individuals above the party. We are seeking people’s support not in my name or any leader’s name, but for LDF on the basis of an election manifesto we placed before the people. We are making 900 promises this time as opposed to 600 in 2016. Kerala Congress (M) is now an integral part of LDF. Does it mean that CPM’s criticisms of K M Mani in his last stint as finance minister were too frivolous? It is the Kerala Congress that chose to align with LDF. They made that political decision citing our secular credentials, our unwavering fight against communalism, our stance on farmers’ issues and our commitment to development and welfare. The LDF government has given priority to the rights of women and their democratic empowerment. Will that reflect in number of ministers in your next cabinet, if LDF retains power?A decision on who will head our parliamentary party will be made only after the election results are out. So, discussions on who will head the cabinet and who all will be part of it would be premature at this point.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/kerala/i-have-cautioned-about-putting-individuals-above-the-party/articleshow/81742072.cms||B S Anilkumar

---||Kochi||Central agencies cooking up statements, claims speaker||T’puram/Kochi: Speaker P Sreeramakrishnan said central investigation agencies have stooped to such a level that they are writing anything as ‘statements’ and this is not good in a democracy. He was reacting to the references, allegedly made by Swapna Suresh in the statement submitted by enforcement directorate (ED), in the high court. In a Facebook post on Sunday, he said ED’s move is aimed at maligning the character of the chief minister and the speaker when the gold smuggling case probe is moving towards their own party. This move is intended to diverting attention from this development. This is unacceptable, said Sreeramakrishnan. False propaganda is being circulated at various phases in the run up to elections as if they were given by investigation agencies. Keralites will realize how central agencies are trying to malign the party and its leaders, he added. The single agenda this election is to make agencies work round-the-clock and attack projects like LIFE and KIIFB which brought changes in society. Nobody should think that such efforts will end public support to the government, he said. There is no dispute over the fact that opposition, which has lost its acceptance among the people, will unleash a plethora of lies against the government, he said. Earlier, gold smuggling accused Swapna Suresh had told ED that Sreeramakrishnan used to call her to a flat Thiruvananthapuram for ‘personal, dirty’ intentions. Swapna’s statement to ED on Dec 16 last year was produced before the high court as part of the case filed by ED challenging Kerala Police’s FIR against it for allegedly forcing Swapna to name chief minister as involved in the smuggling operation. Replying to ED’s question whether Sreeramakrishnan has any other investment other than Middle East College in Oman, Swapna said, “Apart from Sreeramakrishnan’s investments in the Middle East College, Oman, as far as I know the flat at Marutham, Pettah belongs to Sreeramakrishnan, but it is in the name of some other person and he told me about the real ownership of the flat to convince me to feel safe as he used to call me there for some personal dirty intentions.” In her statement, Swapna said whatever was done by M Sivasankar and his team were with the knowledge of the chief minister. She was responding to ED’s question to explain the role played by Sivasankar’s team in chief minister’s office that includes CM Raveendran, Puthalath Dinesh, Startup Mission CEO Saji Gopinath, and Resy George. Swapna replied, “Sivasankar’s above team was aware of all illegal acts done in UAE Consulate, Trivandrum and whenever they wanted any facility in UAE, they got it done through UAE Consulate, Trivandrum. Sivasankar and CM Raveendran are the most powerful and influential persons in CMO. Sivasankar told me that whatever done by Sivasankar was with the knowledge and support of CM Raveendran and Chief Minister himself.” Further, Swapna said the CMO team was instrumental in allotting major project works of the government under various departments to Uralungal Labour Contract Society without tenders and that they were getting huge kickbacks for this through various benami names. Santhosh Eappen told her and Sarith the same and he had wanted to get close to Sivasankar and Raveendran to get contracts of various government projects, Swapna told ED.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/central-agencies-cooking-up-statements-claims-speaker/articleshow/81739338.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad prepares for subdued Holi||AHMEDABAD: It was second consecutive Holi festivities for the state in the shadow of the pandemic as the citizens prepared holy bonfires and prayed for a better year. With restrictions in place, the second day of Holi is expected to be a subdued affair for majority of the citizens. “We prepared the bonfire with organic material such as dung cakes and straws and also added herbs with camphor for cleansing the atmosphere,” said Aparna Trivedi, a resident of Vastrapur. “We prayed for the better 2021 ahead as we have already seen how the pandemic had ravaged the most of 2020.” While some parts of the city saw en masse exodus of the natives of Rajasthan to celebrate the festival despite restrictions, those who stayed back enjoyed the festivities with traditional dance and gatherings with safety protocols in place. “This year, we are going to give our annual Dhuleti outing a miss owing to a couple of cases of Covid-19 in our vicinity,” said Rakesh Patel, a resident of south Bopal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/city-prepares-for-subdued-holi/articleshow/81739848.cms||---
---||Goa||BJP goes family way as Babushall set to make son Panaji mayor||PANAJI: After having made a sweep of the Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) elections by ensuring win of 25 of his handpicked candidates in the 30-member corporation, Panaji MLA Atanasio Monserrate has decided to make his 32-year-old son Rohit the mayor of the capital city. “Rohit will be the next mayor of the city. He will file his nomination papers on Monday,” Monserrate told TOI on Sunday. Rohit, a political novice, contested and won an election for the first time. Monserrate’s choice of his son as the mayor has already got the approval of BJP. Sources said the Panaji MLA left BJP with no choice as he named his candidate, while leaving it to the party to select the deputy mayor. Monserrate—wife Jennifer, an MLA from Taleigao, is already a minister in the Pramod Sawant cabinet—by putting his son at the helm of CCP has sent out a clear signal to BJP that when it comes to Tiswadi, it will be him who will call the shots. BJP under the late Manohar Parrikar had routed Congress in the 2012 assembly elections by blaming it for promoting the development of ‘six families’ and portraying itself as a ‘party with a difference’ that never encouraged ‘family raj’. But with the entry of 10 rebel Congress MLAs led by Monserrate into the saffron fold in July 2019, political observers reckon the hues of the party have already started changing. Elections for the mayor and deputy mayor will take place on Tuesday after all newly elected councillors are administered the oath. Monday is the last day of filing nominations. With BJP-backed panel enjoying huge majority, no surprises are expected. Political observers said it would be tough for Rohit to run the corporation’s affairs on his own as he is new to administration. “He will have to seek his father’s guidance to run the CCP affairs smoothly,” said an observer. Panaji was under BJP’s firm control for close to 25 years. The seat was fiercely guarded by Parrikar, since winning for the first time in 1994. But his death in March 2019 changed equations. Monserrate first won the byelection on a Congress ticket and then hopped over to BJP. Interestingly, BJP had denied Parrikar’s son Utpal a ticket to contest against Monserrate because of questions over dynasty politics. The party instead chose former Panaji MLA and Parrikar’s aide Sidharth Kuncalienkar. Monserrate defeated Kuncalienkar in 2019 by 1,758 votes, the first time Congress won the seat in 25 years. The Panaji MLA later switched over to BJP along with nine other legislators and has since enjoyed growing clout within the party. Last week, Monserrate said he will win all five seats in Tiswadi at the assembly elections scheduled for next year. All five seats are currently represented by BJP, though in 2019 three of them—Taleigao, Santa Cruz and St Andre—belonged to Congress.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bjp-goes-family-way-as-babushall-set-to-make-son-panaji-mayor/articleshow/81740664.cms||Murari Shetye
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Quantum leap for hack-proof communication recorded by Isro-SAC||AHMEDABAD: In early January this year, China developed the world’s first portable mobile quantum satellite station. It is a secure satellite communication system which works on the laws of quantum mechanics thus blocking eavesdroppers. On March 22, Isro’s Space Applications Centre in Ahmedabad declared that it too had demonstrated its quantum communication capacity by holding a live videoconference using quantum-key-encrypted signals. The signals were sent between two buildings 300 metres apart within its campus. This method of quantum communication, according to scientists at the SAC, is considered “future-proof since no future advancements in computational power can break the quantum-cryptosystem.” The next goal for the Isro-SAC is demonstrating Satellite Based Quantum Communication (SBQC). Isro will gear up to connect two Indian ground stations soon, deploying the new technology. A senior Isro-SAC scientist explained, “Quantum communication cannot be intercepted or hacked. This system is the future of secure information transfer for, say, power grids, defence establishments, and banks.” The core of quantum communication is quantum key distribution (QKD). It uses the quantum states of particles — for instance, particles that constitute light called photons — to form a string of zeros and ones to encrypt and decrypt information. Any attempt to eavesdrop on the communication between the sender and the receiver will change this string or cryptic key and be noticed immediately. “In fact, in this technology, we avoid using the satellite as a communications relay,” the SAC scientist said. “Instead, we simultaneously transmit a pair of secret keys to allow two ground stations in India to establish a direct link.” A press release by the Isro-SAC said, “The experiment was performed at night to ensure that there is no interference of direct sunlight.” The release went on to say: “Most of the mission critical technologies used in the experiments were built by Isro in-house, which includes the NAVIC receiver for time synchronization between the transmitter and receiver modules, and gimbal mechanism systems instead of bulky large-aperture telescopes for optical alignment.” The scientist added, “The future is developing small-scale QKD satellites and ground-based receivers, as well as medium and high earth orbit satellites for communication.” In 2016, China had launched the world’s first quantum communication satellite QUESS. Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) and People’s Bank of China are already using satellite-based quantum key distribution between distant cities. Senior SAC scientists told TOI that quantum communication was conceptualized in 1992 in a lab setting by a team of IBM Research and Universities of Montreal and California. Then in 2007 another team ran the experiment over a 100km link. The 2016 Chinese experiment transmitted the signal across 404km.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/quantum-leap-for-hack-proof-communication-recorded-by-isro-sac/articleshow/81740670.cms||Paul John
---||Kochi||State fails to achieve 50% expenditure||Thiruvananthapuram: Six years after the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (Amrut) project began in the state, Kerala has failed to achieve even 50% expenditure. The Centre had extended the project period till March 2021 although the actual tenure had expired in 2020. With barely days to go for termination of the extended period, Kerala couldn’t even attain above 15% in sewage and septage sector, one of the priority areas in Amrut. In the apex committee meeting held in January 2021, secretary of housing and urban affairs stressed on fast-tracking the implementation of projects and the states were directed to award all projects by March 2021, failing which they might lose out on the central assistance and shall have to complete the projects from their own funds. Kerala still has got around 36 projects to the tune of over Rs 400 crore which have to be awarded. As per the report presented in the central monitoring committee for national green tribunal (NGT), the state has 3,759 million litres per day (MLD) of sewage generation and only has only 10 existing sewage treatment plants (STPs) with a treatment capacity of 124 MLD. The state had proposed 139 projects in sewerage under Amurt at a cost of Rs 629.86 crore and six years later, the expenditure is 12%. “We faced issues in finding suitable land and getting statutory clearances. Protests from some sections have delayed the sewage/septage projects compared to other sectors. Also, there was shortage of contractors as sewage is a relatively a non-prominent sector in the state. Work has been awarded in 15 projects of which work was started in seven projects,” said Amrut state mission director Renu Raj. She added that many projects had to be tendered five to seven times as there were no bidders. “We are expecting a relaxation in the deadline as we were not able to award some projects due to the model code of conduct, which is in place,” said Raj. Deputy mission director A L Charles said that lack of experienced contractors often led to retenders and huge tender excess. Consultancy for sewage projects in urban local bodies was marred by controversies. The expenditure under sewage sector in these local bodies is zero after six years, while the only expenditure to show in this sector is recorded under Kerala water authority (KWA). The delay has cost the civic bodies dearly. The high-powered steering committee was forced to approve tender excess, most often 50% or more above the actual cost, in civic bodies under Amrut for undertaking sewage projects and the additional cost has to be borne by the respective local body. Even after finalizing consultants for the sewage project implementation, the delay in getting the projects started forced the steering committee to form a technical resource bank comprising experts in the field of sewage and septage projects and this decision was made five years after detailed project report (DPR) preparation was awarded to private consultancies in various urban local bodies under the project. The delay has been such that administrative sanction (AS) issued for around 10 projects in other sectors three years ago had to be revalidated recently. The projects which had received AS also had to be cancelled in some cases citing lack of ground-level study. For instance, the AS accorded for a stormwater drain project in Alappuzha municipality had to be cancelled as it was found that water pipeline was laid on both sides of the road making construction of a roadside drain non-feasible. The sanction for a project for the development of a park at Vadackal beach in Alappuzha had to be cancelled as the land identified for the park was found outside the cadastral survey and hence, the revenue department couldn’t survey the plan. Projects under many sectors had to be cancelled because of different reasons which has also thrown up questions on validity of feasibility study prior to finalizing a project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/state-fails-to-achieve-50-expenditure/articleshow/81739343.cms||Aswin J Kumar

The probe agency produced CGST joint commissioner Neetu Singh and superintendent Prakash Rasania before special judge J A Thakkar and sought their custodial interrogation for five days. For the probe agency, the district government pleader Praveen Trivedi submitted that the accused persons did not give any clarification about the dialogues that took place during the trap, and the investigator wants to find out whether there is any other partner in the bribe money beside these two accused. The remand application mentioned that the probe agency wants to know from how many traders the accused officers have accepted bribe and for how long the malpractice was going on. The investigation is required into the assets and investments made by the officers. They would be required for video recording statement at the Gujarat Forensic Sciences University (GFSU) at Gandhinagar. Rasania’s advocate Amit Nair submitted that his client was ready to cooperate with the probe agency and that it was not the superintendent who talked on phone with the complainants. After hearing, the court sent both the officials to police custody till March 31 evening. ACB had received a complaint from Syga Home Furnishing after a notice was sent to ascertain difference between input tax credit vide GSTR-3B and credit vide GSTR-2A. The difference was of Rs 1.56 crore, but Rs 5 lakh bribe was allegedly demanded by the accused for not finding any error and to close the file. The joint commissioner talked with the complainant and after some negotiations, the sum had been settled at Rs 1.5 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cgst-officials-sent-to-police-remand-till-mar-31-in-graft-case/articleshow/81739855.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: As pandemic boosts farming, sharp dip in home, edu loans||PANAJI: The Covid pandemic appears to have given agriculture a fresh push in the state while dissuading residents from investing in homes and higher learning. The Economic Survey 2020-21 indicates that farm credit increased tremendously while the number of people availing home loans and education loans decreased sharply. The data also shows that more people borrowed money to tide through the pandemic as the overall advances in the state increased. The spurt in agriculture loans suggests that many individuals took to farming during the pandemic and lockdown, often borrowing funds from financial institutions to start farming. “The overall achievement under the agriculture sector is Rs 817.7 crore upto December 31 as against a target of Rs 752.4 crore for Goa, which is 8.7% over and above the target set,” said the economic survey. As on December 31, disbursement of crop loans stood at Rs 209.7 crore as against a target of Rs 257.3 crore. However, the document shows that the quantum of crop loans disbursed has increased by Rs 168.8 crore in the current financial year as just Rs 40.85 crore for the corresponding period in 2019. Most Goans, who chose to borrow funds, opted for agricultural term loans with Rs 405.1 crore being disbursed till December. NABARD, which prepares the Annual Credit Plan for the state in coordination with all the local banks, had projected a target of Rs 352.5 crore for agricultural term loans. “This is an achievement of 14.9% over the target that was expected,” said a banker. “The overall achievement under the agricultural sector has tremendously increased by Rs 400.9 crore as against Rs 417.25 crore for the corresponding period last year.” Understandably, with job losses, salary cuts and a bleak employment forecast, few people chose to invest in homes and higher education. Home loans dropped by 66% as just 103.6 crore were disbursed to purchase homes against Rs 304.69% crore for the corresponding period last year. The economic survey indicates that during the pandemic, priority sector advances increased by Rs 1,059.8 crore over December 2019. The data shows that with people borrowing, the credit deposit ratio improved to 32%, the highest since 2016, though well short of the 40% benchmark.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/as-pandemic-boosts-farming-sharp-dip-in-home-edu-loans/articleshow/81740671.cms||Newton Sequeira

The cases against the accused, whose name was not disclosed, was filed between 2009 and 2011 based on the police cases registered in Kasaragod. He was arrested at Delhi airport on deportation from Riyadh after CBI managed to issue a red corner notice through Interpol against him. The arrested accused will be produced before the chief judicial magistrate in Ernakulam soon. CBI’s Chennai unit registered a case following an order from the Kerala High Court and it took over the investigation from Kasaragod police. Its investigation in four cases showed that the arrested person and seven other accused were part of a conspiracy in Kasaragod and other places. They floated a fraudulent scheme called Forex trade (trading of foreign currencies) and promised monthly returns to depositor and commission to agents for mobilizing depositors. "They collected around Rs.9.93 crore from depositors and cheated by not repaying the assured returns and the principal amount, thereby caused a loss to depositors. Following the submission of chargesheet, Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Ernakulam declared the accused persons as proclaimed offenders," said a CBI statement. The fifth case was registered on the allegations by a complainant that the accused had collected a huge amount as deposit. The complainant allegedly invested 19 lakh in 2011 and the accused did not pay returns or the principal amount as promised. CBI found merit in his case and submitted a chargesheet. However, the accused was absconding then.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cbi-arrests-accused-deported-from-saudi/articleshow/81739347.cms||---

When a team of Vastrapur police found the woman, the man with her was drunk. The cops booked the man for drunk driving. According to an FIR filed with Vastrapur police, they got a call from the control room about a woman who needed help immediately. The woman had given a number, which was passed on to Vastrapur cops. Tracing the number, the cops positioned themselves on a road between Pakwan Crossroads and Judges Bungalow Crossroads near Atithi Hotel in Bodakdev. When the man spotted the cops, he tried to speed away in his car, but the cops had blocked his path with their vehicles. Police instructed the man to come out of the car. He could barely stand. Police said that they asked the woman if she had called police and she answered in the affirmative. Police held the man, 27, who is a native of Pune and stays in Porbandar. The woman, 23, is also a resident of Porbandar who was brought to the city by the man, her boyfriend, said a cop of Vastrapur police. Inspector R M Sarode of Vastrapur police said that the woman made an emergency call to cops as the man was getting violent with her. “But as she did not make any other allegation of violence when she was taken to the police station, we ended up charging him with the offence of drunk driving,” he said. “They might have struck a compromise later,” said Sarode, as no further complaint had been lodged by the woman in this matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/sos-from-suv-vastrapur-cops-race-to-save-woman/articleshow/81739852.cms||---

The church is located in Old Munnar, around a kilometre from Munnar town. “Renovation works of the church’s roof are going on and will be completed within a week. The church was constructed using rough-hewn granite in Scottish style. We will not be making modifications as part of renovation works,” said Suresh B, treasure of the church. “CSI church and cemetery are historical monuments and one of the main tourist attractions in Munnar. The church authorities decided to preserve the tomb and the Church,” Suresh added. Munnar CSI church is known for the cemetery being constructed before the construction of the church. The construction of the church started in 1910 and was completed in 1911. It was opened for prayers on April 16, 1911. Most artefacts used in the church were imported from England. Munnar’s famous tomb, situated near the hill, had completed 125 year in 2019. Henry Mansfield Knight, the manager of the British tea plantation, built the church in 1911 to fulfil the wish of his beloved wife Eleanor Isabel May. Within days of their marriage, Eleanor died of cholera at the age of 24 on December 23, 1894. As per her wish, Eleanor was buried on the hill. Her tomb is separated by a wall of flowers and her name and date of death is still visible on the tombstone.  The church is now under the Cochin diocese of CSI. Recently Idukki district administration developed a tourism mobile app “Vibjyor” that includes the CSI church as one of the main monuments in Munnar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/historical-csi-church-to-get-facelift/articleshow/81739359.cms||Sandeep Thomas

These ‘double voters’ are in great demand in Tamil Nadu and attempts are made to bring them to polling booths from across the border. Since polling for assembly elections in both states is scheduled on April 6, political parties in Tamil Nadu are luring the voters living in the border areas of Palakkad with all sorts of benefits. Thousands of such voters have reportedly left Kerala for their ancestral houses in Tamil Nadu. Actor Kamal Hassan, also Makkal Needhi Maiam party president, is engaged in a close contest in Coimbatore. His party is reportedly trying to mobilize maximum votes from across the border too. There are reports that nearly seven thousand voters from Malampuzha, Chittur, Mannarkkad and Nemmara assembly constituencies of Palakkad district have votes in Tamil Nadu too. Candidates of these constituencies fear that their voters will be lured to Coimbatore with tempting promises by Tamil Nadu political parties. Such voters have both ration and identity cards in both states. They include farmers, small traders, plantation workers, toddy tappers, etc. Most of these ‘double voters’ are found in the border areas of Walayar, Meenakshipuram, Govindapuram, Gopalapuram, Naduppani, Chavadipara, etc. Political parties warn these voters that they would not get freebies like free ration, free school and college education, food kits, etc, in Tamil Nadu if they don’t vote in the state. The political parties of Tamil Nadu are in regular contact with them through phone and social media. However, the political parties of Kerala in the border assembly constituencies are trying their best to retain these Tamil voters in their constituencies to vote for them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/politicos-of-kerala-tn-woo-double-voters-in-border-areas/articleshow/81739858.cms||---

Figures released by the health ministry show that Mahrashtra leads the pack by far. With a positivity rate of almost 23%, nearly one in four persons tested in the neighbouring state returns a positive result. It is followed by Chandigarh (11.85%) and Punjab (8.45%). However, on Sunday, Goa’s positivity rate rose to 7.4%, as 131 new infections were reported, pushing the active tally to 1,404. The state also saw two deaths, one being a 30-year-old woman from Saligao with anaemia her only comorbidity. The other was a 73-year-old woman from Varca had diabetes, hypertension and heart disease. The state’s death toll stands at 827. Doctors have cautioned against visiting crowded places and meeting people in enclosed areas.“The most important thing besides wearing a mask and maintaining social distance is to stay in well-ventilated areas where virus particles will be few. Stay away from heavily-crowded areas, where the chances of viral load are the highest. The room where you have to meet people has to have cross-ventilation. Never gather in an air-conditioned room or in a closed room,” a doctor said. Panaji continued to have the highest number of positive cases, with 167, followed by Margao with 153, Ponda with 131, Porvorim with 113 and Candolim with 106 The medical fraternity has been cautioning young people against taking the novel coronavirus lightly, saying that the disease can be unpredictable and that they cannot say for certain that only older people will suffer a bad outcome from Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goas-positivity-rate-is-among-highest-in-india/articleshow/81740695.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Thiruvananthapuram||A ‘missing’ star is at sea||Kollam: It was after a good measure of high drama that Congress decided to field Bindu Krishna from Kollam constituency as there were many aspirants for the seat. From the beginning of the electioneering Krishna had informed Congress leadership that she would contest only from Kollam. The differences were ironed out subsequently and Krishna’s name was cleared to take on LDF’s sitting MLA and actor M Mukesh in a constituency which has been leaning towards the Left since 2006. In the 2016 elections, Mukesh won by a margin of 17,409 votes. But his critics complain that the MLA has been ‘missing’ and neglecting the constituency due to his busy schedule as an actor. In his defence, Mukesh claims that he rolled out development projects worth Rs 1,330 crore during his tenure, including the Rs 50-crore Perumon bridge construction project — a long-pending demand of the people who depended on boats to cross the backwaters. “LDF government took up the challenge,” he says. The construction of the bridge was inaugurated in November 2020. However, in the coastal belt at least, fish workers are a disgruntled lot and say there were many vital issues where the MLA should have voiced the concerns of the people. They point out that they did not receive the MLA’s support during the Ockhi disaster and in the fight against Covid-19. “He has no time to listen to our problems. The CPM cadres also share our view,” says Antony A, from Thangasseri. The controversy over the deep sea fishing project and the widespread protest against the government’s alleged move to “sell off the seas” to US-based EMCC has also sparked confusion among the fisher folk. Fuelling their discontent, the Latin Catholic Church in Kollam has also come out against the government. The Kollam Bishop even issued a pastoral letter against the government’s move last Sunday. While Mukesh is still banking on his popularity as a celebrity, his main opponent Krishna is highlighting her presence in the constituency as DCC president. “I have been getting the wholehearted support of the voters as they consider me as a family member. People want an MLA who is accessible and available to them at their moment of need. They do not want to be orphaned again,” Krishna says. Her quick response to grassroots-level issues and her active presence in the media reacting over issues concerning people, especially women, have helped her to establish a close connect with voters. A major problem plaguing her is the organizational weakness of her party. Following the local body elections, Congress has been relegated almost to the third position in the corporation while dark horse BJP made major inroads in the corporation, winning over five seats and coming a close second in several others. NDA has fielded M Sunil, former BJP district president as its candidate. It has been cited that Sunil has not been in the constituency ever since his tenure as district president ended. But Sunil says his absence or the delay in announcing his name would not affect his prospects. “Our workers had already started work centred around ‘sakthikendra’ — a cluster of five booths — and our campaign works are going smoothly,” he says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/a-missing-star-is-at-sea/articleshow/81739895.cms||---

One of the imposters was in police uniform and stopped the truck for checking. Truck driver Amar Singh of Samrala has lodged a complaint with Division 3 police. Businessman Ambrish Kumar of Khanna said he had to send iron rods worth Rs 11 lakh to Bahadurke area of Ludhiana city and he approached a transporter, whose driver, Amar Singh, took the truck to Ludhiana late on Saturday night. In the morning, the transporter told him that some miscreants, posing as excise and taxation department officers, escaped with the truck. Following this, he immediately informed the police. Division 3 SHO inspector Jarnail Singh said driver Amar Singh was feeling sleepy, so he stopped the truck at a roadside and dozed off. Around 3am, four men reached there in a car. One of them, who was in a police uniform, woke Amar up and introduced everyone as excise and taxation officers. The accused asked him to produce the bill and other documents. After checking the papers, they claimed that the bill was under-valued and asked the driver to accompany them to the office. “Thereafter, one accused remained at the spot and the other three took Amar in their car. For three hours, the accused kept roaming around in the city. They then dropped him back near Samrala Chowk and escaped. On reaching the spot, Amar found the truck missing,” added the inspector. The SHO said Amar’s phone was inside the truck, so he borrowed one from a commuter and informed the transporter. The driver’s cellphone location was found to be near Phagwara, so a team has been sent there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/posing-as-taxmen-miscreants-take-away-iron-loaded-truck/articleshow/81739360.cms||---

Yoganathan, a bus conductor with the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC), gives a sapling along with tickets to passengers. “He has been spending a huge chunk of his salary towards the cause and has planted innumerable trees. After listening to this story, who will not appreciate his work? I heartily congratulate his efforts and his inspirational work,” the PM said. According to sources, Yoganathan had planted more than three lakh saplings in the last 30 years and received awards including ‘Eco Warrior’ from the Vice-President and ‘Sutru Suzal Seyal Veerar’ of the state government. Yoganathan, who was on duty when the programme was aired, came to know about it later through his friends. “I am extremely happy. This inspires me to continue my work. I am sure that it would also inspire others to take up tree plantation. Ever since the speech was aired, I have been receiving telephone calls from people, asking for saplings. I have noted down their details and will give saplings to all of them,” he told TOI. “When I started planting saplings 30 years ago, people made fun of me. But things changed after 2008, when I received an award from the Vice-President,” Yoganathan said. “I am conducting interactive sessions on tree plantation for students and IT employees every Monday, on my off day,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/prime-minister-lauds-citys-eco-warrior/articleshow/81740708.cms||Nivedha Selvam

---||Goa||Goa govt finalises action plan for noise mapping, monitoring||PANAJI: The state government has finalised an action plan for noise mapping and monitoring. It has planned remedial measures to curb the noise menace in industrial, commercial, residential areas and silent zones. The government has also made provision for levying penalties on violators. The mapping will be initiated at Verna Industrial Estate for industrial area, Panaji and Margao for commercial and residential areas and Goa Medical College and Cujira school complex, Bambolim, for silence zones. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has issued directions for the preparation of an action plan for noise mapping. “The state government has approved an action plan for noise-level mapping after due consultation with the stakeholder department,” director of environment and climate change Dasharath Redkar said. As per the action plan, a loudspeaker or public address system or any sound producing instruments or musical instruments or sound amplifier shall not be used in open areas without prior permission of the authorities. “Only those diesel generator sets which comply with the provision of the Environment (Protection) Rules, as notified by the Union environment ministry from time to time in respect of acoustic enclosure, noise level, certification, insertion loss and exhaust muffler shall be sold, purchased, supplied/used by any manufacture/dealer/shopkeeper. The diesel generator set operation shall be monitored by the authority prescribed under these rules,” the action plan states. As per the plan, Goa State Pollution Control Board (GSPCB) will carry out noise-level mapping along with police officials on a regular basis. “The noise-level mapping shall be extended to other areas if required on the recommendations of the district magistrate,” the action plan states. The board will carry out noise-level mapping with the assistance of Union environment ministry approved laboratories whenever required and the expenditure incurred for the same will be reimbursed by the environment department. The board will organise capacity building and necessary technical guidance for the officials from the revenue department and police. The board will also monitor noise level whenever required on the instructions of the revenue authorities. The action plan states that the transport department should monitor the horns or other sound producing devices on vehicles to ensure that they comply with rules as per M V Act. “No vehicle with sound boxes or modified exhaust should be permitted to ply. Requirement for complying with these should be indicated in the licences and looked into while issuing and renewing licences. While appropriate legal action may be taken for the first offence committed by the driver/vehicle, in case of repeated offence, route permit, wherever applicable, of such vehicle/driver shall be cancelled and sound creating device seized,” the action plan states. The education or higher education department will carry out awareness amongst students about the provision of these rules with assistance from the board. The town and country planning department, planning and development authorities, public works department and other government departments and corporations should give due consideration to noise pollution as a parameter of quality of life and objective to ensure that the standards of noise level meet the prescribed standards while granting permission for developmental activities, the action plan states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-finalises-action-plan-for-noise-mapping-monitoring/articleshow/81740711.cms||Murari Shetye

---||Coimbatore||Postal ballots distributed to 2,700 people on day 1||Coimbatore: Election officials have started distributing postal ballots to the people aged above 80 years and disabled people, who have availed the facility in the district, at their doorsteps on Sunday. On the first day, postal ballots were distributed to 2,700 people.After the Election Commission of India unveiled the plans to extent the postal ballot facility to senior citizens and disabled people, officials had distributed 12D forms to 74,811 people - 60,035 elderly people and 14,776 disabled people - in early March. However, only 8,642 people - 7,767 elderly people and 875 disabled people - submitted the filled in forms to avail the facility. An official source said they had rejected a few hundred applicants, as they didn’t fit into the eligibility criteria. “Now, there are 7,854 people – 7,249 senior citizens and 605 disabled people – eligible for postal ballot in the district.”He said they had formed 10 teams, comprising a polling officer, micro-observer, booth-level officer, police man and videographer, each in nine of the 10 assembly constituencies in the district to distribute postal ballots. In the case of Valparai segment, 13 such teams were formed because of its geographical vastness.“We have informed the eligible voters the date and time of home visit and asked them to ensure their availability. If they are not at home, the team would make a second and final visit to their houses to distribute the postal ballots. If they are not available, they will miss the opportunity to vote this time for once and all,” the officer said.Explaining that necessary arrangements – a box like structure – would be made at their house to ensure privacy of voters, he said the voters could return the ballot paper in a sealed envelope to the team. “The entire process will be videographed to prevent irregularities.”In neighbouring Tirupur, 3,871 people - 3,430 elderly people and 441 disabled people – have expressed willingness to avail postal ballots. Election officials in that district have formed 155 teams to distribute ballot papers at their doorsteps from Monday.

The health officials said about two days ago, the state health authorities had increased the ratio to 30.As per the data, the weekly ratio in Ludhiana between March 16 and 22 was 16.4, which is higher than the state’s 13.9. The district’s ratio was 17.7 and the state’s 14 between March 14 and 20. Between March 11 and 17, it was 21.8 for Ludhiana and 16.3 for the state. Ludhiana’s ratio was 18.8 and the state’s 15.5 between March 8 and 14.In the ratio from March 16 and 22, Ludhiana is at fifth position in the state. SAS Nagar has the highest (25.8), followed by Faridkot (17.3). Muktsar has the lowest ratio of 1.The health department authorities said they were trying to improve it. Civil surgeon Dr Sukhjeewan Kakkar said, “The overall contact-case ratio has been around 15 and 16, but recently we improved it to beyond 22, even as the target was 20 till recently. With the state health authorities now increasing the target to 30, we will step up our efforts.” The health experts said it was important to increase contact tracing.“The target for contact tracing is set in such a way that no contact of a positive case is missed. It is important to meet the target to break the chain of transmission. Once the contacts of positive patients are traced, they are isolated and later their samples are collected,” said former senior medical officer Dr Rajinder Gulati.The health officials said the teams involved in contact tracing often faced problems as people who came in contact of positive patients try to hide it and resist the process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/district-falls-short-of-contact-case-ratio-target/articleshow/81739384.cms||Shariq Majeed

---||Goa||Emotional violence a common occurrence among dating Goan youth: Study||Panaji: An exploratory study to understand dating violence among Goan college students found that while sexual violence is rare, emotional violence such as controlling behaviour is a common occurrence. The qualitative study by Sangath also found instances wherein girls were coerced by their partners for sexual or financial favours. What has concerned researchers is that students find it difficult to seek help and support due to the lack of acceptance among parents and teachers. The one-year qualitative research project is being funded by the International Centre Goa to understand the nature and severity of dating violence among youth. Sangath conducted in-depth interviews with students in the age group of 18-22 years, and teachers, at six colleges in Goa. “Emotional violence, especially the exercise of control over the other partner, is quite common and part of most relationships,” said Devika Gupta, a researcher with Sangath’s addictions research group. Restricting their partner’s interaction with friends of the opposite sex, demanding passwords of social media accounts, and monitoring online activity are some of the examples of control cited by the students. Some students did say that their partners threaten to reveal details of the relationship to their parents in order to coerce the other partner to perform sexual activities or for monetary favours. “One student mentioned that if she faced sexual violence, she would not report it as she would feel ashamed,” said Gupta, as she stressed on the need for safe spaces where youth, particularly girls, could seek help or support. “There is a need for parents and teachers to acknowledge that getting into dating relationships is a normal part of adolescent development, and that criticising it or banning it does not stop it, but only encourages it to happen in secret and discourages help-seeking in case something unpleasant or dangerous happens,” Gupta said. She pointed out that emotional violence has become so common that students have normalised it and no longer recognise the controlling behaviour. Interestingly, the study found that dating violence can be perpetrated by boys and girls alike, unlike other forms of gender-based violence that are typically perpetrated by men towards women. “The types and severity of violence that girls can perpetrate differ significantly from boys, hence the bi-directionality of violence does not imply equality,” said Gupta as she added a rider to the data. The next step for the study, said Gupta, is to launch a pan-India survey on young people’s mental health and well-being, which will include questions about their dating relationships and violence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/emotional-violence-a-common-occurrence-among-dating-goan-youth-study/articleshow/81740727.cms||Newton Sequeira

---||Delhi||Scripted in Dubai, executed at GTB. Ended in Rohini||NEW DELHI: Kuldeep Fajja, who was killed in an encounter with Special Cell of Delhi Police early on Sunday, had been freed as part of a bigger plan hatched by the Dubai-based gangster Sandeep alias Kala Jathedi to rule the underworld in Delhi, Rajasthan, Haryana, and parts of Uttar Pradesh and Punjab, investigation has revealed. Jathedi, who had also escaped from police custody from Faridabad in February 2020, carries a reward of Rs 7 lakh on his head. To expand his syndicate’s footprints in Delhi, he had joined hands with jailed gangsters like Lawrence Bishnoi and Jitender Gogi, apart from another fugitive named Kala Rana, who is based in Bangkok. The plan was to exploit the vacuum created in the crime world with the arrest or encounter of gangsters, along with the likes of Neeraj Bawania and Anand Pal Singh. On March 26, TOI was the first to report about Jathedi as the possible brains behind the escape plan. Jathedi, who was last learnt to be shuttling between Dubai and Bangkok, decided on commanders for each state and proposed a larger syndicate with members of all gangs. When the big alliance was formed, Fajja was the perfect man as he knew Delhi well and could handle the region under the guidance of Gogi, who is lodged in Tihar Jail. Ankesh, who was injured in the shootout at Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, was the bridge between these gangs to coordinate the logistics. Jathedi, Rana and others had asked local foot soldiers to take orders from him. The level of operations could be gauged from the fact that everyone was briefed on need to know basis. “Of the dozen people who came to GTB Hospital, only two knew the plan was to free Fajja. The others were told that they were there to show strength as there could be a bid on Fajja’s life by rivals. Even after the escape, only 2-3 people knew where Fajja was," said an investigator. After escaping from GTB Hospital, Fajja sought shelter inside Delhi as police were already surveilling his hideouts in Sonipat, Karnal, Mount Abu and other places. Special Cell even had his girlfriend under surveillance. Fajja thought about staying low for a while and then flying out of the country till the pressure was off him. However, Delhi Police’s Special Cell was already tracking the gang members and had also arrested a few of them. Priyavrat, a recently arrested criminal, was quizzed along with others to obtain clues about the contact in outer Delhi who Fajja had met after escaping. Police also analysed their communication done through dongles and Wi-Fi devices. Finally, Fajja was tracked down. Earlier, many associates of Fajja had claimed that he desperately wanted to escape as life had become very tough for him in jail. So, when Jathedi’s offer came, he was more than willing to take it up. While in jail, Fajja coordinated with Deepak Boxer and Ravi Malik, who were killed in the shootout at the hospital, and finalised his escape plan. The encounter of Fajja is being considered as a major blow to the syndicate. The gangsters were operating from jail and strengthening their routes over the past one year since their arrest from a flat in Gurgaon. Fajja and his godfather, Gogi, were at loggerheads with rival gangster Sunil Tajpuria alias Tillu. Their rivalry started during an election at Shraddhanand College years ago as they apparently supported opposing candidates. However, the rivalry turned bloody as they murdered one of Tillu’s associates, Deepak, for allegedly harassing his cousin. Tillu then killed Gogi’s friend Arun Commando in 2015, triggering an all-out gang war. Gogi went on to kill another associate of Tillu, Ravi Bhardwaj, and also singer Harshita Dahiya, a witness of a murder in which his aide Dinesh Karala was an accused. More than 25 murders have been reported in this gang war till now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/scripted-in-dubai-executed-at-gtb-ended-in-rohini/articleshow/81739894.cms||Raj Shekhar
---||Delhi||RWAs take up the fight, urge citizens to choose the hues of precaution||New Delhi: This year, Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) has directed Delhiites to refrain from celebrating Holi in public spaces. Resident Welfare Associations have been sensitising people about the rising Covid-19 cases and encouraging them to stay at home. Most Holi Milan events have been cancelled in the city, and some RWAs plan to deploy volunteers to monitor the situation. Jasbir Chaddha from East of Kailash RWA, who is also secretary general URJA — a collective body of RWAs in Delhi — said that the collective has issued an advisory to all RWAs against celebrating the festival of colours in public. “Most organised RWAs are sending messages to communities to adhere to Covid norms. Unlike Diwali, Holi is a community festival,” he said. Chaddha said that there were two main challenges in adhering to Covid-safe behavior. “People are affected with Corona fatigue and have given up on following appropriate behavior. Secondly, our political leaders are not setting a good example by carrying out these huge crowded rallies. What example does this give to common masses,” he asked. Chetan Sharma, general secretary from confederation of NCR RWAs, said that they are using social media to spread awareness along with festival greetings. “There have been many new cases in the Greater Kailash in the last few days, which has spooked people. Most people are being cautious,” he said, adding that looking at nearby cases on Aarogya Setu app is enough to warn people against being lax. Sharma said that every year the RWA organises Holi milan events, with features like rain dance, itra and flowers, but it has been cancelled this year. BM Bakshi from New Friends Colony RWA said that they have been advising residents to celebrate inside their home through social media groups. “Why should an occasion of celebration become a risk to your near and dear ones? We did not celebrate Holi last year either, as cases were starting to emerge. Police personnel are also in touch and we have been told to contact them if people get unruly or don’t adhere to Covid-safe behaviour,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rwas-take-up-the-fight-urge-citizens-to-choose-the-hues-of-precaution/articleshow/81740730.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Delhi||Just a preview? Delhi cops to crack whip as gangs join hands||NEW DELHI: Two teenagers who were a part of the entourage that had gone to Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital on March 25 to free Kuldeep Maan alias Fajja have been apprehended by Special Cell of Delhi Police, it is learnt. They had thrown chilli powder at Delhi Armed Police (DAP) personnel escorting Fajja from Tihar Jail to the hospital. Till now, around 15 men, who had come to free Fajja in a Scorpio having a police sticker, a car and two bikes, have been identified. Of them, two juveniles were caught, one was gunned down and a fourth injured on the spot. The fifth, Ravi Baggasi, is likely to be arrested this week. Sources said Fajja’s encounter seems only the beginning of a systematic crackdown. Police are not only hunting for the criminals who came to free Fajja, but also other members of the syndicate of gangs, which could become a huge problem for Delhi in the coming days. “The operation has not ended and raids are being conducted in Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand to nab the gang members,” said a senior officer. Meanwhile, the race for Fajja’s successor in Jitender Gogi’s gang has begun. Sources say Deepak Boxer and Rohit Moi are the frontrunners for the post. Strict surveillance has been initiated on Gogi’s gang members lodged in Tihar, Rohini and Mandoli jails. In Fajja’s escape plan, Special Cell had stumbled upon the gang’s communication with criminals outside the jail. “For a gangster to hatch and execute an escape plan from jail, he must have access to communication devices. A plan was afoot to free Fajja two days ago too, but it had to be aborted at the last moment given the high security,” said a source. Frequent searches are in the offing in jail cells to curb mobile usage, said the source. Police also suspect another escape plan in the making and a watch is being kept on all criminals from these syndicates who have applied for medical treatment in the coming weeks. Surveillance will also be stepped on “mulaqats” and visits of outsiders and a call may be taken on deferring their physical appearances in court. DAP personnel have been sensitised about taking precautions and increase in security details of high-risk inmates. Of late, Tihar Jail has been in the news for all the wrong reasons. Be it the plot to kill a Delhi riots accused through mercury poisoning or the Antilia case, questions are being raised on the state of affairs there. While the jail administration claims it is taking measures to maintain order, investigations have been throwing up Tihar links in many cases. Easy availability of phones are another cause for concern.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/just-a-preview-city-cops-to-crack-whip-as-gangs-join-hands/articleshow/81739911.cms||Raj Shekhar

---||Delhi||Cops bust casino in south Delhi hotel||NEW DELHI: A casino allegedly functioning out of Radisson Blu Hotel in southwest Delhi’s Mahipalpur has been busted. Deputy commissioner of police (South West district) Ingit Pratap Singh said that the cops received information that gambling rings had set their eyes on hotels and farmhouses in and around Delhi as most casinos in Mumbai, Goa and Nepal had been shut due to the lockdown. “An informer tipped us off about an illegal casino functioning out of Radisson Blu Hotel. The special staff personnel conducted a raid at room number 101 and 103 of the hotel on Saturday night,” the deputy commissioner said. “During the raid, 14 people, including five women, were found gambling using the chips and coins in the room on special tables. They were taken into custody,” Singh said. The chips, cops said, were used as transaction currency during the card play and actual cash payment was done the next day.

---||Delhi||As first 50 enter Nizamuddin Markaz to offer prayers, management wants restrictions lifted||NEW DELHI: Rakesh Kumar, a policeman on special duty, was seen sitting next to the small iron gate of Alami Markaz Banglewali Masjid in Nizamuddin on Sunday evening. He was holding a list with the names of 50 people whom he had to verify before allowing them to enter the mosque. Delhi High Court had allowed 50 people to hold the prayers on Shab-e-Barat, the festival held in the middle of the Sha’ban month as a “night for forgiveness”. For the first time in a year, people were allowed to enter the mosque after a Tablighi Jamaat congregation led to a series of troubles for those residing in the hostel within the premises. Many in the congregation, a lot of them being foreigners, were found infected with Covid-19 when the lockdown was announced in March last year. Hundreds had gathered there to attend an event from March 13 to 15, 2020. “For the past few decades, holding congregations here has been a common thing as this is the headquarters of the Tablighi Jamaat. It was not the first time that a congregation like that happened,” said a member of the management committee on anonymity. He was one of the five people who were living in and conducting prayers at the mosque to keep some semblance of functioning alive. The mosque, Madarsa Kashif-ul-Uloom and the hostel had been shut for a year. The court took the decision to allow people inside on a plea by Delhi Waqf Board. To prepare for the reopening, the ground floor was cleaned up in the six-storey structure. Ruing the limited number of people being allowed inside, the management committee member said, “When we have been cleared of all allegations and that no one was aware of the Covid-19 situation, then we must also be allowed to function like every other religious structure in the city, especially when Ramzan is due within a few days. The mosque has a capacity of 5,000 people to pray. The general public should be allowed inside.” A man who had reached there before the evening Maghrib prayers gave his name, father’s name and phone number to the policeman to verify that he was one of the people who had been allowed entry. Though hesitant to speak at first, he said, “We were blamed by the media for being solely responsible for spreading the virus in the country. Even now, many still believe that. It was a black mark on us, which is unlikely to go away soon. But it feels good to be back to pray in the mosque after months. For many of us meeting today, it will be tough to remember those days. But God has cleared us of all ills.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/as-first-50-enter-nizamuddin-markaz-to-offer-prayers-management-wants-restrictions-lifted/articleshow/81739928.cms||Mohammad Ibrar
---||Meerut||Meerut SHO ‘purifies’ visitors with ‘Gangajal’||MEERUT: A cluster of bottles full of holy ‘Gangajal’ have taken over his glossy table top, pushing the office folders towards the margin. The surrounding walls are mostly occupied by framed photos of freedom fighters, deities and a small temple. Sitting in the chamber, station house officer (SHO) Prem Chand Sharma of Meerut’s Nauchandi police station believes in controlling law and order with a touch of devotion. Sharma "purifies" every complainant with the sprinkle of holy water, a ‘teeka’ on the forehead amid the chants of “sanitization mantra” in Sanskrit. SHO Sharma claims the exercise has helped him maintain law and order in his jurisdiction. “People have become less aggressive. They come here and calmly give their complaint. The entire Nauchandi area has become quiet. At the same time, we are not backing away from police action against miscreants,” he said.For the last few days, the SHO has been giving the ‘Gangajal’ bottles as Holi gifts to the visitors requesting them to refrain from liquor. “It is an attempt to drive away the perversity associated with Holi festival in the society,” he said. In a video, the SHO says: “Straight from the laps of Mother Ganga, this (Gangajal) is a pure, natural sanitizer. Apart from this, we have a ‘sanitization mantra’ (He then recites the mantra in Sanskrit and sprinkles ‘Gangajal’ on the person sitting in his office). It has been with us for thousands of years. I am not doing anything new but just recalling our ancient heritage.” Senior police officers said that they were not aware of the SHO’s actions. “There are sanitizers kept at every police station. I don’t know why ‘Gangajal’ is being used for it. I am not aware of it and will look into it,” Vineet Bhatnagar, Meerut’s superintendent of police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/meerut-sho-purifies-complainants-with-gangajal-says-helps-maintain-law-order/articleshow/81738717.cms||Piyush Rai

---||Delhi||President gives assent to Bill that says ‘government’ in Delhi means ‘LG’||NEW DELHI: President Ram Nath Kovind on Sunday gave his assent to the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Act, 2021, which gives more power to the lieutenant governor over the elected government. The Act now mentions that “the expression “government” referred to in any law to be made by the legislative assembly shall mean the lieutenant governor”. The GNCTD (Amendment) Bill, 2021 was passed in Lok Sabha on Monday and in Rajya Sabha on Wednesday amid ruckus by the Opposition members. The central government announced the presidential assent through a gazette notification. The Bill sought to make changes in Section 33 so that the “legislative assembly shall not make any rule to enable itself or its committees to consider the matters of day-to-day administration of the capital or conduct inquiries in relation to the administrative decisions”. Also, now the LG’s opinion will be required before taking “any executive action in pursuance of the decision of the council of ministers or a minister, to exercise powers of the government, state government, appropriate government, lieutenant governor, administrator or chief commissioner, as the case may be, under any law in force in the capital”. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had tweeted on Wednesday: “RS passes GNCTD Amendment Bill. Sad day for Indian democracy. We will continue our struggle to restore power back to people. Whatever be the obstacles, we will continue doing good work. Work will neither stop nor slow down.” On Sunday, Kejriwal thanked Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan “for supporting the people of Delhi against BJP’s assault on democracy and federalism” after the latter tweeted that the Bill was “an affront to our federal principles and rights of states”. Though Aam Aadmi Party had vehemently opposed the Bill, it couldn’t be reached for comments on Sunday. Union Minister G Kishan Reddy had said the amendments would lead to transparency and clarity in governance in Delhi and enhance public accountability. Explaining the rationale behind the Bill, he added that the amendments had been brought to remove ambiguities in the existing Act. He stressed that changes in the law had been sought in the spirit of what was said in a Supreme Court judgment. Reddy said there was no political angle and the amendments were on “technical” grounds. “The Bill does not curtail in any manner the powers enjoyed by Delhi government that are already provided in the Constitution," he had added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/prez-gives-assent-to-bill-that-says-government-in-delhi-means-lg/articleshow/81739948.cms||---

IMD forecasts a warm Holi, with the mercury expected to hover around 38 degrees Celsius on Monday. A met official said calm wind conditions and clear skies had led to the rise in temperature, with the mercury set to drop from Tuesday onwards as wind speeds increase. “This is the warmest day thus far and it could be even warmer on Monday. We expect clear skies and low wind speed, which will lead to a high maximum temperature. From Tuesday onwards, the mercury will start dropping and wind speeds will be around 25-35 km/hr during the day,” the official added. IMD forecasts a maximum of 36 degrees on Tuesday, 35° C on Wednesday and 34° C on Thursday. The weatherman said wind speed could be as high as 45 km/hr on Wednesday, leading to cooler conditions as compared to Sunday and Monday. In 2020, the highest maximum recorded in March at Safdarjung was 33.3 degrees Celsius. It, however, touched 39.2 degrees Celsius in 2019, 38.6 in 2018 and 38.8 in 2017.

Donning the “topi” was a must for Holi revelers. The demand resulted in a turnover of Rs 30 to Rs 40 lakhs. The prevailing Covid-19 pandemic has taken the sheen off Holi this time. These families stare at huge losses as demand has dipped. Naseem Ahmad, a topi-maker , said, “Covid-19 pandemic has eclipsed this vocation. Last year, Holi occurred before the lockdown, so we had decent business. But this year, the demand is nowhere to be seen.” There is no market for these caps in Delhi and UP. Haneef Rahmani, a manufacturer, said, "Topi-making is our art passed down from one generation to the other. We know no other skill. There are several families engaged in this work. Our women and children help us to fulfill the orders given by brokers. But this time, we have no orders for the topi.” Suleiman, another maker, said he did not know what to do with the caps made in anticipation of the demand picking up due to the unlock. “The situation has again started deteriorating. There are heaps of caps in my house. All hopes have dashed. Many of us have run out of savings and are facing huge losses. Earlier, my family earned Rs 10 lakh from this work.” He has now pinned his hopes on the upcoming panchayat elections to make up for some of his losses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/pandemic-takes-sheen-off-amroha-topi-this-holi/articleshow/81738726.cms||Harveer Dabas

---||Nagpur||Oxygen shortage continues: Many deaths attributed to forced discharge by hospitals||NAGPUR: A day after private Covid hospitals pressed the panic button, NMC issued a strict advisory barring them from referring serious patients to public hospitals without confirming bed and ventilator availability. It said “many deaths were being reported on way, just before or after arrival”. Private hospitals hit back saying continued lack of oxygen and ventilators was forcing them to transfer patients to medical colleges or other hospitals. The helpline for O2 related queries too was not responding, hospitals complained. Resident deputy collector Avinash Katade, the nodal officer for oxygen supply, didn’t respond to TOI queries. However, the administration claimed improvement in availability of medical oxygen while hospitals said they were assured of only Sunday’s supply while uncertainty prevailed regarding coming days. Manufacturers said the supply would depend on reporting of staff and transport vehicles that may remain off duty due to Holi on Monday. Some hospitals having more than 100 patients said as of now they did not plan to discharge patients and were doing all they can to procure oxygen and arrange ventilators. The district received around 400 empty jumbo cylinders from four districts in the region. These are meant to carry additional stock being manufactured in view of increased demand and sold to private hospitals facing shortage. On Saturday, the district administration had sought 600 empty jumbo cylinders from Gadchiroli, Bhandara, Gondia and Amravati. District collector’s office, joint director of Industry department, NMC and FDA are jointly monitoring the oxygen supply situation. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B said situation was better on Sunday. “Some hospitals were over-reacting and unnecessarily demanding more supply. This has been sorted out. 400 cylinder were brought from outside. NMC is purchasing more cylinders which were approved last year,” he said. Additional municipal commissioner Jalaj Sharma said supply and distribution system has been regulated by the four authorities. “The system was already in place as every hospital has their own tie up. We are just keeping an eye as consumption has gone up,” he said. VHA president Dr Ashok Arbat said till last night, many hospitals were staring at having to discharge their patients. “Certain measures have been taken but they couldn’t change the situation overnight. As of now, there was no complaint but there is no guarantee of tomorrow,” he said. Some hospitals said suppliers had communicated to them they can’t increase the supply anymore. “We need two tankers of liquid oxgyen per day. We are getting only one from Butibori. I may have to discharge patients if it continues like that,” said director of a hospital having over 100 patients. Another director said they bought oxygen concentrater from outside the state. “The concentrator converts air into gas and the dependence on government and manufacturers has come down. I am encouraging others too to use concentrators too,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/oxygen-shortage-continues-many-deaths-attributed-to-forced-discharge-by-hospitals/articleshow/81739966.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

The Nashik rural police and the airport administration immediately swung into action. The flight — which had just taken off — was recalled, all the passengers were made to deplane and the aircraft was checked by the Bomb Detection and Disposal Squad (BDDS). No bomb was found. The flight, which was originally to leave at 8.25 pm, finally left for Hyderabad at 11pm. Meanwhile, the passenger who had made a hoax call was nabbed from the Satpur area of Nashik city and arrested under sections 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 505 1-B (action with intent to cause fear or alarm to the public) and other sections of the IPC by the Dindori police. The passenger was produced before a Dindori court, which remanded him in two-day police custody. The passenger is a 33-year-old resident of Gandhi Nagar in Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh. He is an engineer and works at a site of the Samruddhi Mahamarg highway project. Superintendent of police Sachin Patil said the passenger had booked an online ticket for Hyderabad. However, on Saturday, when he went to the counter at the Ozar airport, he was told that the PNR was invalid and he should purchase a new ticket. An altercation erupted between the airport staff and the passenger. He then went out and called the police control room. The incident was also captured on the CCTV. District collector Suraj Mandhare, in a release, said that the passenger concerned had called the police control room on 100 saying that he had overheard two people talking about a bomb being planted in the aircraft. The aircraft had to be re-landed and after shifting all the passengers to a secured place, the aircraft was checked. No bomb was found. The police identified the location of the fake caller and detained him in Satpur. A statement released by Alliance Air said, “As safety is a first for us, prompt action of deplaning was taken by the airline keeping safety of passengers as top most priority as soon as the information was reported. A case has been registered against the accused for making the hoax bomb threat and the matter is under investigation by the security agencies. The bomb disposal squad and security agencies visited and did a thorough check and couldn’t find any bomb. We assure our flyers that their safety is of prime importance to us and strict and correct safety procedures were followed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/bomb-hoax-delays-hyderabad-bound-flight/articleshow/81740958.cms||Santosh Sonawane

---||Vijayawada||AP govt’s vote-on-account ordinance for Q1 gets governor’s green light||AMARAVATI: Governor Biswabhushan Harichandan has approved the vote-on-account ordinance sent by the state cabinet. The government on Sunday issued orders for budget approval soon after getting the governor’s clearance for cabinet proposal. The state cabinet had sent a vote-on-account proposal with an estimated outlay of Rs 90,000 crore expenditure for the first quarter of the coming fiscal for approval on Friday. Although the state government wanted to go for the assembly session to clear the budget, the elections to village panchayats and municipalities delayed the process. With the Election Commission of India (ECI) issuing notification for the conduct of by-election to Tirupati Lok Sabha constituency which fell vacant following the death of Balli Durgaprasada Rao, the state cabinet opted for the ordinance route. Bringing an ordinance for a vote-on-account was the only option left with the government as it could not convene the assembly to clear the appropriation bill before March 31. The state government can convene the session to clear the full budget at its convenience before June 2021. Interestingly, this is the third time in a row for the government to depend on vote-on-account. Earlier, the TDP government had cleared the vote-on-account in February 2019 in view of the general elections held in the state in March. Subsequently, the YSRC government also opted for vote-on-account following Covid-19 pandemic in last March. Clearing the budget, either full or vote-on-account (for first quarter), before the expiry of the current fiscal is mandatory for the government to withdraw funds from the treasury even to pay salaries and pensions in the next financial year. The government can also spend on developmental works and clear the pending bills only if the budget has the approval of the governor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/govts-vote-on-account-ordinance-for-q1-gets-governors-green-light/articleshow/81738753.cms||Samdani MN

Only last week, due to the bridge repair work, residents of Tiswadi and Ponda talukas received restricted water supply. The areas to be affected are Panaji, Taleigao, St Cruz and St Andre constituencies in Tiswadi, including Goa Medical College. In Ponda, part of Priol and Marcaim constituency areas will received restricted water supply. “Due to work of replacement of bearing and strip seal of expansion joints of Banastarim bridge, there will be shutdown of conveying main pipeline on March 31. Consumers are requested to bear with us for the inconvenience caused,” the PWD has said in a notice. This pipeline carries water from the Opa water treatment plants to Ponda and Tiswadi. PWD officials said that urgent maintenance works were required to the Banastarim bridge and to ease the load on the bridge during the works, created by the water pressure, the supply needs to be cut off. Each pillar of the Banastarim bridge has four bearings. The repair works of a single pillar are being taken up at a time. Last week, the works were first taken up on a trial basis. Due to the work, Ponda and Tiswadi residents had experienced restricted water supply on March 24 and 25. Bearing replacement of the remaining five pillars of Banastarim bridge will be taken up on five different occasions. PWD officials have said that the Tiswadi will have restricted water supply on five more ocassions on April 7, 14, 21 and 28 and on May 4. Shutting down the pipeline for a day means it takes at least two days for the water supply network to operate to full capacity. Around 150MLD of water is treated at the Opa water treatment plants, which meets the drinking requirement of Ponda and Tiswadi taluka. More than 60MLD of this water is required to meet the needs of Tiswadi, including the capital city and the Goa Medical College. Raw water for Opa is pumped in from the Khandepar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/for-second-week-tiswadi-ponda-to-receive-restricted-water-supply/articleshow/81740753.cms||---

The government will officially roll out its initiative, Jagananna Palle Velugu, on March 31. It had earlier issued an order to transfer operation, repair, and maintenance of energy efficient LED street lighting project from Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL), and New & Renewable Energy Development Corporation of Andhra Pradesh) NREDCAP to village secretariats. The panchayat raj department will utilise services of around 7,000 energy assistants in coordination with the discoms for maintenance of street lights. The department will also rope in the services of its two-lakh-strong village volunteer network for identifying and reporting non-functioning street lights to village secretariats. The EESL has already conducted training programmes for village secretariat staff on maintenance of street lights. The panchayat raj department will also develop a comprehensive web portal for handling and monitoring of LED street light complaints. The AP State Energy Efficiency Development Corporation Limited (APSEEDCO) — a joint venture between AP power utilities — will be responsible for distribution of spares, maintenance activities and further monitoring of the project. Panchayat raj and rural development minister Peddireddi Ramachandra Reddy described the initiative as another “revolutionary step” taken by chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy. Speaking to officials during a review meet ing, the minister said that improved light quality would enhance safety, security and better visbility in villages. Principal secretary for panchayat raj and rural development Gopal Krishna Dwivedi informed the minister that steps are being taken to install another four lakh LED lights across 2,303 gram panchayats, in addition to over 23 lakh lights installed by EESL in 10,382 panchayats. “It is estimated that LED lighting programme will help gram panchayats to cumulatively save around 260 million units of electricity annually worth Rs 156 crore,” said Dwivedi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/maintenance-of-leds-now-under-panchayats/articleshow/81738719.cms||---

---||Nagpur||20% Covid +ve patients die in GMCH, IGGMCH in 12-month pandemic||NAGPUR: Around 20 of every 100 Covid-19 positive patients admitted in two state government hospitals — Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) and Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGGMCH) — have died in the year-long pandemic. The case fatality rate (CFR) of these two hospitals is nine times the overall CFR of the district. The district civil surgeon data says 8,515 positive patients were admitted in IGGMCH and 7,587 in GMCH for a total of 16,102 between March 11, 2020, and March 28 this year. It is 7.36% of total positive patients (2,188,20). Of the 16,102 patients admitted, 3,313 had died in these two hospitals for CFR of 20.57%. Fatalities were 1,660 in IGGMCH and 1,653 in GMCH. CFR of GMCH is 21.79% and 19.5% in IGGMCH. The district has registered 4,931 fatalities as on Sunday. These two government hospitals have witnessed 67.19% of the deaths. Overall CFR of the district is 2.25% (4,931 deaths as against 2,18,820 patients). Thus, CFR of these two government hospitals is nine times more than overall CFR of the district. A team of officials from ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW) in a meeting on Saturday expressed concern about high number of deaths in GMCH and IGGMCH. The team had reportedly directed municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B and collector Ravindra Thakre to get done audit of deaths and initiate measures to reduce the CFR. Medical superintendent of GMCH Dr Avinash Gawande and deputy medical superintendent of IGGMCH Dr Sagar Pande told TOI, “We are admitting patients who actually need hospitalization. Therefore, almost all patients are admitted in critical condition. Also, patients are coming for hospitalization after health deteriorates in home isolation. Number of patients brought dead is also high.” Officials from GMCH and IGGMCH said on condition of anonymity, “Private hospitals are not accepting patients in critical condition, or senior citizens with comorbidities. We hospitalize all patients who require treatment. Even some private hospitals discharge and send patients in critical condition to GMCH and IGGMCH.” An official from IGGMCH said, “One doctor is required for every two patients in ICU. IGGMCH has two doctors for 30 patients in ICU. IGGMCH can take care of 300 patients with existing staff. But IGGMCH is forced to admit and treat 600 patients.” GMCH also has been complaining of staff shortage. The district has started to witness second wave of the pandemic from second week of February. There were 177 deaths as against 15,514 patients for CFR of 1.14% in February. The number of positive patients surged in March, with 69,032 cases registered as on Sunday. There have been 596 deaths, which are four times that of February. But CFR has declined to 0.86% in March due to high number of cases. Though cases are higher in March compared to August and September last year, the number of deaths and CFR is less. The district had registered 1,465 deaths from 48,457 cases for CFR of 3.02% in September last year. In August, 919 of total 24,163 patients died for CFR of 3.8%. Of total 17,417 patients, 919 died in October for CFR of 3.55%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/20-covid-ve-patients-die-in-gmch-iggmch-in-12-month-pandemic/articleshow/81740047.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Delhi||‘Emotional wellness should be a part of mainstream learning’||New Delhi: There is a need to push for emotional well-being into the domains of learning and mainstream subjects. This was stated by deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia in a conversation about mental health and socio-emotional learning during the Harvard Social Enterprise Conference. “There has always been a dire need to inculcate resilience in our daily lives through education. During the pandemic, staying at home was in itself a huge trauma. Children faced immense loss of learning, there was a looming uncertainty regarding the future and many people lost their jobs. These were tough times for all and resilience played a key role here,” said Sisodia. Deliberating upon the innovations spearheaded by Delhi government for mental health and well-being, Sisodia said, “When the need for well-being emerged, we developed the Happiness Curriculum and encouraged students and teachers to practise mindfulness. The objective was to develop self-awareness, inculcate skills of critical thinking and inquiry, enable learners to communicate effectively and help children apply life skills to deal with stressful and conflicting situations around them.” “Another initiative to develop resilient children is the Entrepreneurship Mindset Curriculum. Irrespective of what children pursue, we want them to think like entrepreneurs — willing to dream big, try new and challenging goals, be able to recognise opportunities around, and then plan and execute to bring them to fruition,” said the deputy CM. Speaking about the key elements that need to be changed or introduced in public education, the deputy CM said, “The biggest takeaway from the pandemic for our public education has been that technology is here to stay. We need to quickly adapt to and encourage the use of technology.” Pointing towards Delhi’s first virtual school model, he added that it would carry the hallmarks of any regular government school in the city. “Leadership has to involve stakeholders. Our leadership is not top-down, but more collaborative. For example, for developing the Happiness Curriculum, our teachers had a big role to play and their recommendations were heard,” said Sisodia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/emotional-wellness-should-be-a-part-of-mainstream-learning/articleshow/81740089.cms||---

---||Nagpur||After bed and O2, life-saving ventilators in short supply||NAGPUR: Already running short of beds and oxygen supply, private hospitals are now searching ventilators as more Covid patients are turning critical. But many hospitals are on the waitlist for as long as a month to get the life-saving equipment delivered. Being a high-value equipment, ventilators are not stocked by dealers and suppliers but requisitioned through orders from different cities and countries. Hospital administrations are not even able to get a single ventilator on rent either. Industry representatives say the waiting period has always been two to three weeks but now ventilators are needed under emergency, which companies didn’t anticipate. Doctors say even for a delayed delivery they are being demanded 100% advance. Though hospitals allot 10% of their capacity for ventilator beds in their critical care unit (CCU), all are running full at any given time. The hospitals had also requested civic administration to provide them around five to six ventilators like it was done in August-September but the medical colleges too are not in a position to spare any at the moment. VHA president Dr Ashok Arbat said private hospitals are taking immediate decision. “But promises regarding augmenting government’s own infrastructure and facilities have not been met. Hence, we are facing this situation,” he said. Kunal Hospital director Dr Shishir Shrivastav said nearly 30 to 40% patients are requiring ventilator support. “It is becoming difficult to provide ventilators to all such patients. We are under stress,” he said. According to Dr Shrivastav, any hospital has to keep two to three ICU beds with ventilators as back up for already admitted patients who may need them. “Therefore, we are trying to buy more ventilators to cater to critical patients being brought from periphery and outside. But it may not be possible to get more ventilators till next month,” he said. He said the admitted patients are suddenly going into cytokine storm. A bio-medical equipment supplier said, “The wave is so fast that even we didn’t expect anything like this. Companies too are taken aback.” Giving reason for the delay, the supplier said that they have to be imported as multinational brands are result-oriented and rarely malfunction. “So, clinicians trust these brands more. Generally, we would get orders for 2 or 3 but suddenly it has shot up to 20. The demand is highest from Maharashtra,” he said. The supplier added that metro cities are priority for companies as they have large markets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/after-bed-and-o2-life-saving-ventilators-in-short-supply/articleshow/81740098.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

On Sunday afternoon, they gathered at YPS Chowk and near Moti Bagh gurdwara and tried to march to the CM house. The teacher union claims that eight of its member were injured in the police cane-charge. Teacher union press secretary Deep Banarasi said: “We protested for three months near cabinet minister Vijay Inder Singla’s house in Sangrur, and for the past eight days, some of us are atop a water tank in Patiala as part of the protest. In March alone, the Patiala police have cane-charged us twice. What happened to the CM’s ‘Ghar Ghar Rozgar’ promise? We have been demanding jobs for years now.” He said: “On March 8, some of the protesters had to jump into the Bhakhra canal near Patiala’s Pasiana village to escape the police assault.” Patiala DSP Sourav Jindal said: “We had to use force when they manhandled the cops. Legal action is on but we released them away from the agitation site.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/jobless-teachers-cane-charged-in-patiala/articleshow/81740094.cms||---

He said the new panel will be announced soon. D’Souza had announced BJP-backed panel — Mapusa Development Front — a month ago and many of his candidates had filed their nomination papers also. However, after several receiving several petitions, the high court of Bombay at Goa struck down reservation notification issued by directorate of municipal administration and cancelled elections to five councils including in Mapusa. Stating that new candidates will be announced soon, the Mapusa MLA said that winning ability will be considered while selecting candidates. “We are working on the new panel for the municipality elections as I have more time to take everyone into confidence,” D’Souza said, adding, “If sometimes the councillor cannot be accommodated, he should be able to respect the decision and wait for the next election.” After BJP’s win last week, he said the party will try to ensure that BJP-backed panels win in the remaining five municipalities. The state election commission (SEC) is yet to announce the election date.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/half-of-bjps-candidates-for-civic-polls-will-change-joshua/articleshow/81740756.cms||---

The CCTV camera outside the victim’s house captured the car in which the perpetrator was present and also the reaction of the girl. Wadi police were shockingly not keen to register an offence despite CP Amitesh Kumar’s intervention after the girl narrated her plight to her family. The minor’s mother had to call the CP for the second time before the offence was registered after much delay on Sunday. The girl was playing outside when a white colour car (MH 31 FE 8524) stopped near her. Going by the CCTV footage, now in possession of TOI, the girl was twice summoned by the motorist. The minor later confided to her maternal grandmother that she was shown some nude pictures by the motorists from his cellphone. The motorist also reportedly abused the girl’s mother. Someone by the name ‘Shukla’, who resides near Police Line Takli, is the owner of the car, said a police source. The minor’s mother, who is also a complainant in an ACB trap case against a police constable, said she has been facing harassment ever since action was taken in 2019. An assistant sub-inspector and a head constable were booked in the case in which allegations against the cops were serious. According to the case, they were booked for demanding Rs25,000 and women for pleasure. Last week, there was a ruckus at the office of the assistant commissioner of police (ACP), Jaripatka division, where the minor’s mother had gone for recording her statement against the constables who are now facing departmental inquiry. The woman claimed that cops were not recording her statement and instead, were putting pressure on her. She had lodged a complaint with the ACP office too against the cops. In past, the woman had approached Wadi police after unidentified persons tried to abandon condoms near her gate and also against an ‘officer’ who was trying to misbehave with her on the phone. Her DVR was also stolen from her house but Wadi police did not lodge an FIR. SP, ACB, Rashmi Nandedkar said she would request the CP to ensure safety of the woman.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/six-year-old-shown-porn-to-teach-her-mom-a-lesson/articleshow/81740103.cms||Soumitra Bose

During the meeting, the FDA commissioner reviewed the measures that are being taken by FDA (drugs) Nashik to ensure that there is no shortage of oxygen as well as Covid medicine. Joint director of FDA (drugs) Nashik Madhuri Pawar said that during the meeting, the FDA commissioner was informed about the steps that have been taken in Malegaon to ensure sufficient supply of oxygen and remdesivir injections. On Saturday, FDA officials conducted a meeting with senior officials of Malegaon Municipal Corporation (MMC) to gauge their difficulties so that they could be addressed. The officials concerned were made aware about the stock of remdesivir available with government hospitals and also the name of the distributor who could provide them with additional stock as per their requirement. With respect to oxygen supply, a meeting was was also conducted with all the nine manufacturers of medical oxygen. In addition, senior officials of MMC were informed about the supplier who would provide them with the required oxygen. Further to deal with the miscommunication between hospitals and medical oxygen suppliers, it has been decided that a memorandum of understanding (MoU) is to be made between the supplier and the hospital. According to the MoU, the hospital would inform the supplier about its requirement in advance so that it is obligatory upon the supplier to make provision for the same.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/fda-commissioner-takes-stock-of-o2-remdesivir-in-nashik/articleshow/81738435.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Chandigarh||Farmers hold their first rally at Hola Mohalla||Patiala: The Sanyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) on Sunday organised the farmers’ first ever Hola Mohalla conference in Anandpur Sahib. At the venue near Mata Nanki Charitable Hospital, its members again asked for a repeal of three new agri-marketing laws of the central government. Bharti Kisan Mazdur Union Anandpur Sahib president Shamsher Singh said: “The tractor-trailers moving towards Anandpur Sahib for Hola Mohalla were blocked for hours on the way, as the administration wanted to lessen the crowd because of Covid-19. We got the permission for the conference a day ago, on the condition that we’ll follow the Covid protocol.” Speaking on the sidelines of event, farmer unionist Manjit Rai condemned the attack on a BJP legislator in Punjab and said showing black flags to the MLAs and raising slogans was fine in a democracy but the farmers shouldn’t insult or attack anyone. Actor Yograj Singh used the stage to say that farmers should contest all the assembly seats in Punjab. He had made the same appeal at the Fatehgarh Sahib kisan rally a few days ago. However, farmer unionist Rajewal said contesting elections was not their motive. Farmer unionist Manjit Singh Rai said: “Yograj’s views are welcome but we want only an MSP (minimum support price) law and a repeal of the last three Acts.” Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) president Bibi Jagir Kaur paid obeisance at Anandpur Sahib and proposed observing 400th Parkash Purb as human rights day. She also proposed renaming the Agra-Delhi highway after Guru Teg Bahadur and Delhi-Anandpur-Sahib road as ‘Guru Teg Bahadur Sees Marg’. She said she will write to the central government about this. Reacting to the attack on a BJP MLA, she condemned the incident but asked to “consider its circumstances”, which she said were created by “the government’s no reaction to the farmers’ agitation”. She blamed the Punjab government for “not providing the BJP leaders with security despite the public anger against them”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/farmers-hold-their-first-rally-at-hola-mohalla/articleshow/81740101.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Only 33% eligible sr citizens, comorbid take vaccine in 28 days in district||NAGPUR: Only 33% of the estimated eligible people from age-appropriate groups have taken Covid-19 vaccine in the district in 28 days, before the second dose starts. Divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar has directed officials to ensure inoculation of all senior citizens and comorbid by end of April. The government had rolled out vaccine for 60+ and 45+ with specified comorbidities from March 1. Second dose is to kick-off after 28 days from first dose. As per data of state’s public health department, 1,73,502 people from 60+ age group and 50,176 from 45+ with specified comorbidities took the jab in the district between March 1 and 28 for a total of 2,23,678. Guardian minister Nitin Raut had said target is to inoculate 6.87 lakh people from age-appropriate groups in the district. Considering this target, 32.56% senior citizens and comorbid have been administered the vaccine. Among 35 districts in the state, Nagpur district is fourth highest after Mumbai, Pune and Thane in vaccination of these groups. Second dose of beneficiaries will become due from Monday. Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and Zilla Parishad (ZP) conducted vaccination on Sunday and decided not to do on Monday, which is on Holi. Thus, the beneficiaries who took vaccine on March 1 can begin to take second dose from Tuesday. Kumar visited a couple of vaccination centres in rural areas of the district on Sunday. He directed officials to expedite vaccination programme on mission mode and ensure inoculation of all from eligible groups by end of April. Couple of weeks ago, Raut had set the target to increase number of beneficiaries to 40,000 per day. The district had achieved vaccination of 20,000 on couple of days last week but the number declined. Raut had also directed increase in number of centres to 300 in the district. At present, there are 193 centres in the district. NMC had sought permission from state government to start vaccination in 32 private hospitals, but got permission for only two hospitals. The state has sent NMC’s proposal to central government for permission. The centre had allowed 24x7 vaccination. But NMC and ZP could not start even a single centre for round-the-clock inoculation. Mayor Dayashankar Tiwari had also directed the same in the general body meeting a couple of days ago. NMC is planning to provide services in six centres, but fearing low response and more wastage of doses. Home minister Anil Deshmukh in a meeting on Sunday also directed expediting vaccination of senior citizens and comorbid in the district. From April 1 onwards, all 45+ people will be able to take vaccine without certificate of comorbidities. This is likely to increase the number of beneficiaries. The vaccination on Sunday received very less response. Only 3,390 people from age-appropriate group, healthcare workers and frontline workers turned up for inoculation in the district on Sunday as against daily average of 13,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/only-33-eligible-sr-citizens-comorbid-take-vaccine-in-28-days-in-district/articleshow/81740107.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||---||BJP will win 26 of 30 seats in Phase 1 of Bengal polls: Amit Shah||NEW DELHI: Asserting that BJP has a decisive edge over rivals in West Bengal and Assam after the first round of polling, home minister Amit Shah on Sunday urged people of Nandigram, where CM Mamata Banerjee and former aide-turned-BJP nominee Suvendu Adhikari are locked in a high octane contest, to ensure defeat of the Trinamool chief. Shah said a vote against the chief minister would bring about the "poribortan" (change) which people of the state want to see. The minister will lead a roadshow in the constituency on March 30 for the April 1 polls in the second phase. At a press conference at his residence on Sunday, Shah said BJP would win the polls in both states as the party has done well in the first phase. He said BJP would win 26 of 30 seats of the first phase in West Bengal and at least 37 of 47 in Assam where polling took place. "If Nandigram brings poribortan, change will automatically come in Bengal," Shah said. Senior leaders are confident that party candidate Adhikari is ahead of the chief minister and will win the polls by a "comprehensive margin". Shah reiterated that BJP was set to achieve its target of winning over 200 seats in the 294-member West Bengal assembly and improving its alliance tally of 86 seats in the 126-member Assam House, saying people have voted for the "positive" agenda espoused by the party. The minister said peaceful polling in Assam and West Bengal and high voter turnouts were positive signs for the two states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/west-bengal/bjp-will-win-26-of-30-seats-in-phase-1-of-bengal-polls-shah/articleshow/81741102.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||3 days after inauguration, Hindu temple comes under attack in Pak||Amritsar: Inaugurated on March 25, a Hindu temple in Pakistan came under attack by miscreants on Sunday while the temple’s renovation work was in progress. According to sources, a group of miscreants vandalised Rawalpindi’s Purana Qila Mata Mandir. “Nearly a dozen youth had attacked the Hindu temple following which an FIR was registered against them,” said sources, adding that the damage was not much. On March 25, the Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB) had handed over the management of the Hindu temple, which was closed since Partition to the local leadership of Rawalpindi. All these year, a few Muslim families lived inside the temple premises. In February, ETPB took possession of the temple after its illegal occupants were evicted, following which the restoration work of Hindu temple began. Sources claimed the temple was attacked by the evicted illegal occupants, who were backed by a local land mafia. The temple was allegedly constructed by Moti Ram and Asa Anand in 1930 near Moti Ram Dawakhana in Purana Qila. Meanwhile, reports of Hindu community celebrating Holi festival were received from various parts of Pakistan, especially from Sindh. Holi functions were also held at Lahore’s Krishna Mandir and Rawlpindi’s Hindu temples. Holi functions were also held by Hindu Pannchayat’s across Pakistan, informed sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/3-days-after-inauguration-hindu-temple-comes-under-attack-in-pak/articleshow/81740109.cms||Yudhvir Rana
---||Delhi||Admission criterion: Delhi HC asks govt if bus route can be used to calculate distance||NEW DELHI: What is the basis to determine the distance and award points against this criteria in nursery admission? Can a school use the route covered by its school bus to calculate the distance? Delhi High Court has decided to examine these questions and asked the Aam Aadmi Party government to respond. “Whether it is permissible to substitute the distance criterion by a measurement of the distance covered by the school bus in order to determine the points awarded to an applicant is, in my view, a matter that requires further consideration,” justice Prateek Jalan noted in an order last week. The court pointed out that “prima facie”, the charting of distance on the basis of route covered by the bus “is not justifiable, particularly when the consequence is severe, inasmuch as a child is denied admission on this basis.” Its poser to the government came while hearing the plea of a girl child denied admission under one of the categories. Appearing on her behalf, advocate Khagesh B Jha informed the court that her residence is at Gautam Nagar, located very near AIIMS, which is included in the “below 8 km” classification by the school carrying 30 points. But the school treated her residence beyond 8km and close to Andrews Ganj, which is in the next category (above 8 km to below 10 km) since Gautam Nagar falls within the jurisdiction of post office Andrews Ganj, awarding her 20 points for distance. Arguing that it is not a valid basis for classification, Jha showed a screenshot of the Google Maps application, showing the distance between the school and the girl’s residence as 8 km. However, the school opposed the plea, arguing that distance criterion is on the basis of the route of the school bus. The school claimed the calculation of the school bus route shows that Gautam Nagar is more than 12 km away from the school and produced a chart showing all the bus stops at which the school bus stops, prior to reaching Gautam Nagar taking a route that came to 12.5 km. In its defence, the school also cited a Google Maps screenshot that showed a bus route at 14.4 km. But the court said it is evident from the school’s screenshot that its bus takes a circuitous route. “While a bus route cannot always reasonably be expected to be of the shortest distance between any two points, it is difficult to accept that a bus route which covers 12.5 km for a point which is 8 km away, should determine the fate of a child’s application for admission to a school. It must be borne in mind that the bus route itself is determined by the school, and not by an independent entity. It is also evident from the school bus route that areas which are admittedly farther away from the school than Gautam Nagar, would fall within the second and third classification, whereas Gautam Nagar would fall only within the last classification,” it underlined. Issuing notice to the government, the court made it clear to the school that if the girl wins the case she has to be granted admission and said it expects the school to fill seats accordingly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/admission-criterion-hc-asks-govt-if-bus-route-can-be-used-to-calculate-distance/articleshow/81740120.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||Shimla||Strategic Manali-Leh highway opens 2 months ahead of schedule||Sarchu: Landlocked Ladakh has been reconnected with Himachal by road after four months as Border Roads Organisation (BRO), on Sunday, officially opened the strategically important 428km-long Manali-Leh highway to vehicular traffic, two months ahead of schedule. The first convoy of seven oil tankers was flagged off by executive councillor, Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council, Stanzin Chosphel from Sarchu, the boundary of Himachal and Ladakh. Oil tankers and some other vehicles moved to Ladakh from Himachal. Chief engineer of Project Deepak, Brig M S Baghi and chief engineer, Project Himank Brig Arvinder Singh, commanders of both the projects and other BRO officials were also present on the occasion. Opening of the road has come as a relief for people of Ladakh. Also, government and Army will not have to remain dependent on flights for essential supplies anymore. A BRO spokeman said the organisation had carried out snow clearance on 149 roads, having length of 3,965km, to ensure that communication lines remained open in remote high altitude areas of the country. “The strategically important Manali-Leh highway used to remain closed for six months, leaving Ladakh dependent on supplies through aerial routes. The road is open this year at least one and a half months ahead of normal schedule,” he said. He added that snow clearance on Manali-Leh highway had started in mid-February with a strategy to simultaneously commence snow clearance on the major passes of Baralacha (16,047ft), Nakeela (16,170ft), Lachungla (16,616ft) and Taglangla (17,582ft). “The strategy was to increase snow clearing attack points. Therefore, Baralacha and Taglangla were addressed from both sides. Latest high tech machinery was used and our jawans worked relentlessly day and night to provide early connectivity to Leh,” he said. BRO officials said inauguration of Atal Tunnel completely changed the dynamics this year by doing away with the need to clear snow from Rohtang Pass. With this, complete focus was on opening of Baralacha, which was tackled from both sides – Patseo and Sarchu. As equipment required was already stored in Sarchu in November before blocking of the highway, a team of six jawans, including the engineer, risked their lives and trekked across the dangerous Baralacha Pass to reach Sarchu and start clearing snow from the opposite side. Besides less snowfall and clearing of snow from Baralacha and Taglangla, Atal Tunnel has been a major reason for opening of the highway in March for the first time in history. Manali-Leh highway has five major passes but BRO was not required to clear snow from Rohtang Pass, which poses the main challenge. This road, which remains closed for six months in winter, opened two months ahead of schedule. Military convoys, trucks carrying ration, fuel and other essentials and other vehicles will use the highway frequently in the days to come as Srinagar-Leh highway is still closed. Soon, tourism will also pick up pace in Ladakh. Despite the opening of the highway, there is a possibility of fresh snowfall blocking it again for a day or two. However, BRO will keep clearing the snow to widen the highway. Other road maintenance works along the highway will also start in a few days. Lahaul-Spiti police will also establish the seasonal post at Darcha and Sarchu in a few days to regulate traffic and keep an eye on each vehicle and person using the border road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/strategic-manali-leh-highway-opens-2-months-ahead-of-schedule/articleshow/81740115.cms||---

Naxalite literature, a 303 assault rifle and cartridges etc were seized following the raid. The commandos were patrolling in the backdrop of ongoing tactical counter-offensive campaign (TCOC) of the Naxalites when a fierce encounter took place. At three different ambush points, the Naxalites had challenged the C-60 squads separately, but had to make a retreat under pressure of mounting firepower. Blood stains and a firearm at the place of encounter suggest likelihood of a Naxalite being injured. Police searched the area but no bodies were found. Substantial material of daily use was also seized from the encounter site.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rifle-naxal-literature-seized-after-encounter/articleshow/81740122.cms||Soumitra Bose

Earlier, the students were given a final grade on the basis of their performance in the unit tests, half-yearly exams and the annual exams but this year, the half-yearly and the annual exams couldn’t be conducted primarily due to Covid-19. Therefore, the education department has decided to evaluate students on the basis of their performance in the upcoming home exams. The department has said that the new grading pattern will be applicable even for those state government schools which were able to conduct unit tests or the half-yearly exams. The department has also directed the principals of the state-run schools that question papers should be set on the basis of the chapters that were covered by the teachers in their respective schools. This decision has been taken keeping in view that some of the schools recorded good attendance during the online classes that were conducted during the Covid-19 lockdown but most of the schools witnessed a poor student turnout during the period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/education-dept-to-change-grading-pattern-for-students-of-classes-vi-ix-xi/articleshow/81738832.cms||Mohammad Anab
---||Nagpur||1,341 high-rise buildings constructed sans fire NOC: RTI||Nagpur: Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s fire and emergency department has found that 1,341 high-rise buildings have been constructed without obtaining no-objection certificate (NOC). “Installing firefighting system in these multi-storey buildings is mandatory as per the Maharashtra Fire Safety Act,” said chief fire officer Rajendra Uchake. Besides, there are 5,595 high-rise buildings which obtained the department’s NOC but were yet to install firefighting system, as per the fire department’s response to a query under RTI by activist Abhay Kolarkar. The department said notices have been issued to almost all such building occupants and property owners over the issue. Educational institutions, industrial buildings and assembly buildings (comprising marriage halls/lawns banquet halls etc) were the biggest violators as owners of these buildings had no NOC while constructing structures, the department said. The city has 1,341 unsafe buildings including 117 residential, 273 educational institutions, 67 hospitals, 249 assembly buildings, 7 commercial complexes, 125 mercantile buildings, 274 industrial buildings, 31 warehouses, 51 hazardous buildings, 119 mixed occupancies and 29 residential hotels and hostels. The RTI reply revealed that of the 5,595 buildings, the biggest violators of not installing a firefighting system were residential buildings followed by assembly buildings and industries. Inspection by the fire department revealed that as many as 1,496 residential buildings across the city had no firefighting system. Similarly, 854 assembly buildings, 665 industries and 495 hospitals too have violated the Maharashtra Fire Safety Act by not installing firefighting equipment. In cases of 1,341 and 5,595 high-rise buildings, the fire department issued notices to 3,061 citing deficiencies in firefighting measures and asked them to comply with the Maharashtra Fire Prevention and Life Safety Measures (MFPLSM) Act. After this process, the department declared 1,895 buildings unsafe, the RTI reply revealed. As per the procedure of the MFPLSM Act, the department has issued directives to Orange City water and MSEDCL to disconnect water and power supplies to 1,030 buildings. It has further sought the help of city police to help them in vacating 177 buildings after owners failed to comply with notices served to them. The department has also filed FIR against owners of 223 buildings, the RTI further revealed.

---||Nashik||Vax drive: Senior citizens surpass health workers||Aurangabad: As many as 29,460 senior citizens have taken the first dose of the Covid vaccine in Aurangabad so far. The number shows that the response to the immunization drive among the senior citizens in Aurangabad district has been better in comparison to the other target groups.While the elderly beneficiaries had already left behind the frontline workers in terms of Covid vaccination, now they have surpassed even the healthcare workers in taking the first vaccine dose. So far, only 22,788 healthcare workers have taken the first dose of the Covid vaccine in Aurangabad district, whereas the number of frontline workers who have taken the jabs is 15,690. The number of citizens aged above 45 years (with comorbid conditions) has also increased to 13,334. Given the good response to the immunization drive, vaccination centres will remain open on Monday even if it is a public holiday on account of Holi. Aurangabad collector Sunil Chavan said vaccination against Covid-19 is an effective tool in combating Covid. “All target beneficiaries should undergo the vaccination. As announced by the Centre, everyone above 45 years will be eligible for the vaccine from April 1,” he said. Dr Yashwant Gade, the secretary of the Aurangabad chapter of the Indian Medical Association, said the elderly population staying away from the false/negative propaganda surrounding the vaccine was key. “The senior citizens stay away from different social media platforms and, therefore, are not influenced by such propaganda. Many health workers and frontline workers are in their 30s and 40s and choose not to opt for vaccination. We again appeal to all beneficiaries to take the vaccine,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/vax-drive-senior-citizens-surpass-health-workers/articleshow/81738442.cms||Prasad Joshi

He said every member in the rally would wear a mask and follow Covid-appropriate behaviour.“We are worried about the rising number of Covid deaths in Aurangabad. The lack of healthcare infrastructure and manpower has compounded the problem. A lockdown till April 8 cannot be an option. Boosting the healthcare system is the answer,” he told reporters. Citing official data, Jaleel said 868 posts are vacant at the Aurangabad Government Medical College and Hospital. The super-speciality building of the GMCH has 219 vacant posts. “The health department of the civic body has 83 posts vacant, whereas the zilla parishad has 332 vacancies in its health department. The government cancer hospital also has 122 empty positions and its extension facility has 364. The 200-bed women and child hospital is yet to materialise for the want of land. Another 30-bed hospital proposed by the Ayush ministry last year is yet to see any progress,” he said. Jaleel said a secretary-level official has conveyed to the Aurangabad divisional commissioner the inability to fill these posts due to financial issues. “If that is the case, then the state government should divert Rs 400 crore sanctioned for the Balasaheb Thackeray memorial to boost the healthcare institutions. The Centre is also splurging crores of rupees on the construction of a new Parliament building. A part of the funding can be made available for making salary provisions for the posts that need to be filled,” the MP said.Jaleel also questioned the omission of industries from the proposed curbs in the district from Tuesday till April 8. “Around 2 lakh people are employed in the local industries and their lives matter. It is the district administration’s appeasement measure to exclude industries from the lockdown,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-mp-wants-funds-to-be-diverted-to-health-infra/articleshow/81738454.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Vendors shy away from fish market, NMC to cancel pact||Nagpur: The property tax department of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has proposed to cancel its agreement with wholesale and retail fish vendors, who have procured platforms in air-cooled fish market in Mangalwari. The proposal will be tabled before the standing committee meeting to be held on March 30. In 2010, as a part of its plan to develop hygienic fish market, the NMC had approved developing an air-cooled fish market in Mangalwari vegetable market. The market was built by the National Fisheries Development Board (NFDB) and Maharashtra Fisheries Development Corporation (MFDC) and it was readied by 2014 at a cost of Rs3 crore. The indoor market comprises four platforms for wholesale and 108 for retail sale of fish, besides having an auction gallery, two cold storages to preserve fish. Since the beginning, no fish vendor had shown interest citing huge deposit and rent. Though NMC had relaxed the deposit norms, still it found few takers. Even after so many years, those who entered into an agreement with the NMC were setting up shops in parking area outside the market complex. Fish vendors from Bhoipura wholesale fish market too pointed this out before the high court, which took serious note of selling fish in unhygienic surroundings. The HC had, in the past, directed the NMC to shift the fish market from Bhoipura to Mangalwari market complex. However, traders there showed no interest citing the size of platforms was very small, even though 79 fish vendors had entered into an agreement with the NMC agreeing to set up their shops inside the complex. Now, the NMC has decided to cancel the agreements with vendors. Along with this proposal, the civic administration has also submitted a proposal to spend Rs1.09 crore for pesticides and tablets to control vector-borne diseases in corporation limits. Hotmix department has submitted a proposal seeking provision of Rs1.91 crore for purchasing raw material for roads in the city from a shortlisted bidder M/s Altaf Ahmed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/vendors-shy-away-from-fish-market-nmc-to-cancel-pact/articleshow/81740131.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Nashik||As rural hospitals become DCHCs, non-Covid cases sent to other hosps||Nashik: As 15 rural hospitals across the district have been converted into DCHCs, non-Covid patients are being referred to primary health centres (PHCs) or other government facilities.Ailing patients from across the rural areas of the district visit the rural hospitals for treatments that are often not available at the primary health centres. Most of the rural hospitals can handle minor surgeries and are equipped with gynaecologists, paediatricians and anaesthetists. Rural hospitals are also the first referral centres of the PHCs spread across the district. If a patient cannot be treated at the rural hospital, then he/she is re-referred to the sub-district hospitals or the Nashik civil hospital.Given that the rural hospitals are now functioning as DCHCs, non-Covid patients have to visit the other government facilities like the sub-district hospitals at the taluka place or the Nashik civil hospital. There are 33 medium to large government hospitals across the district, including the 540-bed Nashik civil hospital and the 200-bed general hospital in Malegaon. Additional CS Kishor Shrivas said all efforts are being made to ensure all the patients, including those suffering ailments other than Covid, are provided with the best possible treatment. He said despite a surge in Covid cases, the Nashik civil hospital has been getting a continuous flow of patients from across the district. Last year, there was a drop in patients arriving at the Nashik civil hospital only because of the lockdown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/as-rural-hospitals-become-dchcs-non-covid-cases-sent-to-other-hosps/articleshow/81738455.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: This memory device can mimic working of human brain||Remember mathematical genius Shakuntala Devi, who was also referred to as the human computer for her ability to perform complex calculations faster than computers? The human brain is a remarkable organ that can outperform modern processors on many tasks. The brain needs far less energy (~20 watts) as compared to supercomputers (~30 megawatts), making it a natural inspiration for future computing systems, referred to as neuromorphic computing. Neuromorphic computing aims to bring a new wave of artificial intelligence (AI) applications that can facilitate highest computing speeds while reducing the need for bulky devices, bringing down cost of manufacturing, energy requirements and the amount of heat generated by these devices. Now researchers at Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad, (IIT-H), have made headway in this direction by developing a graphene oxide based synaptic memristor (memory) device that mimics a biological synapse. A biological synapse is a part of the nervous system. It serves as a site of contact between nerve cells and allows a neuron or nerve cell to pass an electrical or chemical signal to another neuron. IIT-H researchers have developed a resistive random-access memory (RRAM) device using GO for enabling future neuromorphic computing applications. The device uses graphene oxide an that is sandwiched between silver, which serves as the top electrode, and fluorine-doped tin oxide as the bottom electrode. So how will this device help speed up computing? “In existing computers, RAM and central processing units (CPU) are distinct entities. Thus, data has to be shuttled between memory and CPU at high speeds to perform computational tasks, which consumes substantial energy and time. The device demonstrated by us will mimic a human brain by storing as well as processing data,” said Suryanarayana Jammalamadaka, associate professor, department of physics, IIT-H. He pointed out that though various oxide-based memory devices have been investigated for neuromorphic computing, graphene oxide has emerged as a promising material with excellent downscaling and compatibility and will be an energy-efficient hardware for improved computation and information processing. “This research can help us eventually build devices that will process large datasets without the need for bulky devices or buildings to store them. This can be used in AI, ML and data sciences. With this, computing is only set to get faster. We have tested our device for its durability and found that the device performed reliably and continuously for 450 times with a retention time of 10,000 sec,” said Jammalamadaka. The outcome of this research has been recently published in reputed peer-reviewed international journal, Nanotechnology. The published paper was co-authored by Dwipak Prasad Sahu and Prabana Jetty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/this-memory-device-can-mimic-working-of-human-brain/articleshow/81740140.cms||Preeti Biswas
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand employing van praharis through funds meant for compensatory afforestation?||DEHRADUN: The recent move of the Uttarakhand government to employ around 10,000 villagers as ‘van praharis’ for safeguarding of forests by using crores of rupees of funds meant for compensatory afforestation has stoked controversy after activists alleged that the funds are being misused by select forest officials in connivance with politicians for vote- bank politics as elections are drawing near. The usage of Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA) funds – which are meant to ensure plantation of more trees in lieu of those felled – being diverted for populist schemes comes even as the Centre had pulled up the state government for not doing enough to ensure compensatory afforestation in the state where trees have either been felled or earmarked to be felled for big-ticket projects like Char Dham all-weather road, Dehradun airport expansion etc. “How can the government divert the funds meant for tree plantation or forest upkeep in the name of giving employment to villagers? The government has to find avenues to pay villagers or local youth on their own rather than simply throwing away the funds to appease voters ahead of polls. CAMPA laws say that the funds can only be used for rejuvenating the forest and water conservation in lieu of the forest land that has been diverted and not for any other purpose,” said Reenu Paul, Doon-based environmental activist. The Centre had approved Rs 225.09 crore for Uttarakhand under CAMPA for year 2020-21 and on further request of the state in the wake of the upcoming Kumbh Mela in Haridwar, a supplementary budget of Rs 128.55 crore was also approved in the month of February. Sources said that the supplementary budget that was received on February 15 has now been diverted for works other than compensatory afforestation. This includes hiring of 10,000 village youth as announced by forest minister Harak Singh Rawat sometime back. The youth will function as van praharis and will be hired from April 1 to August 30 and be paid Rs 8000 per month. Incidentally, while approving the supplementary budget of 128.55 crore, the executive committee of CAMPA had clearly stated that the funds cannot be diverted or be available after March 31. A copy of a letter signed by the assistant inspector general of forests, Ajeeta Longjam, available with TOI, testifies to this. Since the funds have to be used before March 31, the villagers to be taken on board as ‘van praharis’ are being identified in haste and money bing transferred to their accounts in advance which has irked many forest officials. “How can payment be given to an implementing agency without the work even being done? It is a clear-cut abuse of power just to loot the government exchequer. Once the funds are transferred to a person’s bank account, it would be next to impossible to ensure that the person is even doing the work for which they have been paid in advance,” said a conservator of forests who did not wish to be named. Questions are also being raised on the need to have additional van praharis considering that Uttarakhand is the only state in the country which has a system of community-based forest management bodies – van panchayats — to look after the forests near villages. When queried about these issues, forest minister Harak Singh Rawat told TOI, “The funds are diverted only after approval from experts’ committees along with NGOs and then sent to the Centre for approval. Their experts had initially rejected the proposal put forward by and had asked us to change the language from van prahari to multipurpose works. We made the changes and got the approval sanctioned. After all it is state’s money only which is being put to use in the state.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/uttarakhand-employing-van-praharis-through-funds-meant-for-compensatory-afforestation/articleshow/81738849.cms||Shivani Azad

Villagers shouted slogans against the duo and also demanded Reddy’s arrest. Meanwhile, rural SP Hari Balaji told TOI that no offence or FIR has been registered against Reddy even though Chavan’s husband has filed a complaint. “We have received a complaint and it is being thoroughly looked into,” said an officer of Dharni police station. Shivkumar’s police custody remand ends on Monday. The case was being investigated by SDPO Sanjay Kale but since the issue concerned the suicide of a lady officer, the police administration handed over the probe to a lady SDPO Poonam Patil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/images-of-shivkumar-reddy-set-afire/articleshow/81740137.cms||---

Prior to this, the highest monthly number of cases in the city was recorded in September 2020. However, unlike in September 2020, the number of deaths have reduced significantly in March this year. The first coronavirus case in the city was reported on April 6, 2020. The first Covid-related death occured on May 5 last year. By May 31, the city had 214 cases and had reported 10 Covid deaths. However, the number of patients started increasing and in June 2020, there were 1,948 confirmed cases and 95 deaths. In July, the case tally rose to 7,259 and the infection had killed 171 patients. There were 16,010 cases and 215 deaths reported in August. In September, the city had recorded 26,021 new cases and 247 deaths.Between March 1 and 27 this year, the city has recorded 26,196 cases and 81 deaths. “The coronavirus is highly infectious, but it is not fatal. The virus is in a mild form. Therefore, the number of critical patients is also comparatively low. The number of new cases has increased in March this year, but the number of Covid deaths in March is much lower than recorded in September 2020,” said Bapusaheb Nagargoje, the medical superintendent of NMC.Although the number of cases has increased, there has been a continuous drop in the Case Fatality Rate (CRF) in Nashik city. The CFR was 4.27% on May 31 and 4.81% on June 30 last year. It had reduced to 2.92% by July 31 and 1.92% by August 31. The city again recorded a drop in CFR to 1.43% in September and 1.39% in October last year. The CFR was 1.33% by January-end this year and further reduced to 1.28% by February-end. By March 27, the CFR was 1.04%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-city-records-highest-monthly-cases-in-march-21/articleshow/81738467.cms||Tushar Pawar

When asked why cow dung was being used instead of colours, Giri said that cow dung is considered sacred and is dear to Lord Krishna. “Though there is no mythological evidence of saints playing Holi with cow dung, akhada seers have been doing it for ages and hence the tradition continues,” added Giri. Mahant Risheshwaranand, president of Chetan Jyoti Ashram, Haridwar, said, “Earlier, when there were no gulals (coloured powder), people used to play Holi with sand and soil. But now-a-days, we play holi with colours as this makes for a better way to celebrate the festival. However, cow dung is considered pure and pious and thus, people have been using it to play Holi for ages now.” Apart from cow dung, Naga sadhus, who hold a prominent place in the Kumbh Mela and in most of the akhadas, will play Holi with ash, which is considered sacred in their sect. Seers of a few akhadas will also shower flower petals on each other to mark the festival.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/seers-gathered-for-kumbh-in-haridwar-to-play-holi-with-cow-dung-ash-flowers/articleshow/81738859.cms||Ishita Mishra

The attack was severe and complicated with leakage of fluid from the pancreas duct in the abdomen, leading to a serious and ‘life-threatening’ condition,” said gastroenterologist Dr Saurabh Mukewar.These patients typically require comprehensive management with medications and a procedure called endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in which a stent (plastic tube) is placed in the pancreas duct to close the site of fluid leakage.Generally, this is successful in more than 95% cases.“However, in this particular case the procedure was not possible due to severe narrowing (stricture) in the pancreas duct. Hence, we decided to go for a novel procedure,” said Dr Mukewar who performed this surgery along with endoscopy technician Shailesh Chawhare, radiographer Prashant Gongal and anaesthetist Dr Sheetal Gajare. In EUS guided pancreatico-gastrostomy, under guidance of ultrasound fitted over an endoscope (endoscopic ultrasound), a small needle was passed into a narrow 2mm duct of pancreas across the stomach wall. Following this, a hole was made in the stomach and pancreas using small instruments and eventually a plastic stent (tube) was placed across the stomach into the duct of pancreas successfully.“This is a technically demanding and challenging procedure requiring precision and fine control of instruments,” said senior gastroenterologist Dr Shrikant Mukewar.Following this procedure, the patient had gradual improvement in his condition and eventually the leak stopped, and his life was saved.EUS-guided processA promising new technique for pancreatic drainage and pain reliefWorks when conventional access to the pancreatic duct is not possibleA small needle was passed into a narrow 2 mm duct of pancreas across the stomach wallFollowing this, a hole was made in the stomach and pancreas using small instrumentsEventually, a plastic stent (tube) was placed across the stomach into the duct of pancreas successfullyRare process, first time performed in central India, claim doctors||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rare-surgery-saves-patient-with-leakage-in-pancreas-due-to-alcohol/articleshow/81740146.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Chandigarh||MLR found seven injuries upon MLA Narang: FIR||Bathinda: Muktsar SP (Headquarter) Gurmel Singh in his complaint made to the Malout police, on the basis of which FIR number 56 has been registered, stated the police had provided security for Narang who was planning to address a press conference at BJP office on National Highway 7 at Malout. Nearly 300 protesters reached outside BJP office and started opposing the MLA. He asked the BJP leaders not to come as protesters were sitting outside office and they should go somewhere else for the proposed programme due to security reasons. “The MLA, along with BJP district president Rajesh Pathela, came but police took them to a nearby shop, the FIR reads. The SP told about it to SSP and demanded more force. In some time some SHOs reached there. “We had a word with the protesters to get MLA out, they assured to lift the protest after some time. The police repeatedly told the protesters to keep the protest as peaceful and apprised that the MLA has cancelled the programme,” it adds. Upon assurance by protesters he, along with other cops, was taking the MLA out to get him to sit in his vehicle when protesters Nirmal Singh and Lakhanpal Sharma and many others came there and attacked Narang at around 4.15pm. He tried to save the MLA, but the protesters even attacked him and the MLA with intention to kill, according to the FIR. “We asked the protesters on speaker system to be peaceful, but they got more aggressive and protester Avtar Singh tore off the clothes of MLA and in no time 2/3 others too tore off the clothes and threw black oil on him and the policemen. The protesters thrashed me and even pushed me and I fell down but police somehow took the MLA to a shop. Then protesters pulled out the flex board at the BJP office and torched it,” the SP’s complaint reads. The police took the MLA to Malout civil hospital. A medico legal report VK/2021/010 dated 27.3.21 found seven blunt injuries, with injuries number 1,2,3,6 simple, and 4,5,7 under x-ray.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mlr-found-seven-injuries-upon-mla-narang-fir/articleshow/81740138.cms||---

The RT-PCR lab is ready to operate. “We have already conducted trials of RT-PCR tests and sent reports to the ICMR couple of days ago. We have applied to the ICMR for its approval to start RT-PCR tests there,” said Bapusaheb Nagargoje, the medical superintendent of NMC. “We are expecting the permission in a day or two and we will immediately start testing at our lab,” he said.“Initially, the NMC will conduct around 2,500 RT-PCR tests per day at its new lab,” he added.District guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal had recently directed the NMC to set up the RT-PCR lab. NMC had also received funds of around Rs 4 crore under the district development planning committee, but the process to set up the lab was delayed.After the rise in cases particularly from the last week of February, municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav had directed the health officials concerned to speed up the work of the proposed RT-PCR lab.Accordingly, the NMC administration speeded up the process, procuring the machinery and related equipment for the lab. The NMC immediately recently conducted trials for RT-PCR tests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-awaits-permission-to-start-testing-at-new-rt-pcr-lab/articleshow/81738479.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Chandigarh||BJP protests against Congress govt, calls for Malout bandh today||Bathinda: A day after farmer organisations activists beat up and stripped BJP MLA Arun Narang and vandalised the party office in Malout, BJP activists held a protest against the state government led by Captain Amarinder Singh at the party office and demanded its dismissal. BJP leaders and activists also accused the police of failing to discharge its duty of protecting the dignity of the elected representative. In protest against the attack on Saturday, BJP gave the call for Malout bandh on Monday and burnt the effigy of the Congress government in Punjab. Party workers also disrupted traffic at a road in Malout. While police deployed considerable force on Sunday to prevent more violence, protesters steered clear of the BJP office. Muktsar BJP district president Rajesh Pathela and state-level leaders Sunita Garg and Sukhpal Sran said Saturday would be remembered as a “black day” for democracy in Punjab. “The way MLA Arun Narang was treated, with his right of dignified life put on the backburner, the protest has crossed all limits of decency. Everyone has the right to protest, we do not mind the protests of farmers, but this could never be justified. It seems political players infiltrated into the protesters and police miserably failed in discharging its official duty. Now, we will not sit back and will oppose this government tooth and nail,” he said. Apart from beating up the MLA, the protesters also vandalised the BJP office and set a few articles on fire. They did not even spare the policemen who tried to protect the MLA. Muktsar SP (Headquarters) Gurmel Singh sustained injuries and had to be hospitalised. Muktsar superintendent of police (SP Investigations) Rajpal Singh said police are making efforts to identify those responsible for thrashing and stripping the MLA. Efforts are being made to arrest those who have already been recognised. A case under various sections, including attempt to murder was registered against nearly 300 persons late on Saturday night. BJP activists held protests and burnt state government effigies at various other places, including Bathinda as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/bjp-protests-against-congress-govt-calls-for-malout-bandh-today/articleshow/81740154.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Dehradun||Contrary to state’s claim of 55k, data reveals barely 5k Covid tests done per day in Haridwar||DEHRADUN: Days after union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan pointed out to the Uttarakhand government that 55,000 Covid-19 tests per day (50,000 antigen and 5,000 RT-PCR) — that the government was claiming it was doing — are not enough for Haridwar Kumbh given the sheer size of the gathering, data accessed by TOI from the health department reveals that in the last one week, barely 5,000 tests (including RT-PCR and antigen) had been done every day in Haridwar. Apart from the Centre, the Uttarakhand high court had also warned the state to take stringent measures to ensure the mega religious event doesn’t turn into a Covid-19 hotspot. The HC had observed that there was a possibility of upsurge in cases after the shahi snans, when seers of akhadas take a dip in the Ganga. According to data provided by the health department, 2,791 samples had been collected for testing on March 28, 3,965 samples on March 27, 4,715 on March 26, 4,850 on March 25, 4,443 on March 24 and 5,732 samples on March 23 from Haridwar. It is expected that the city will witness the footfall of at least 50 lakh people once Maha Kumbh starts on April 1. “Haridwar has collected 2,68,160 samples between January 1 and March 15. On the Mauni Amavasya snan on February 11, the district collected 15,298 samples, all for antigen tests. On the day of Vasant Panchami snan on February 16, 20,596 samples were collected, again all for antigen. On the Magh Poornima snan on February 27, 29,663 tests were done in Haridwar and 38,911 tests were done on the day of Maha Shivaratri snan on March 11,” said a senior health department official on the condition of anonymity. Health watchers believe if the government doesn’t implement an effective strategy immediately, Kumbh might become a “pandemic catastrophe”. Anoop Nautiyal from Social Development for Communities Foundation, an organisation closely tracking the Covid-19 pandemic in the Himalayan state, said, “The Covid-19 scenario is changing rapidly in our state. The total of 1,204 cases reported last week, between March 21 and 27, are 116% more than the previous week’s cases and 7% more than the week before. On Sunday, Uttarakhand recorded the highest ever daily spike this year at 366 Covid-19 cases. More testing is the need of the hour. If the state doesn’t act immediately, the Haridwar Kumbh mela will be a pandemic catastrophe.” The state health department, when contacted, assured it is following all testing guidelines as mandated by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). “We are doing the number of tests according to ICMR guidelines. All rules are being followed,” secretary (health) Amit Negi told TOI. In his strongly-worded letter to Uttarakhand chief secretary Om Prakash, the union health secretary had said that at least 10 to 20 pilgrims are testing positive for Covid-19 daily in Haridwar, as were a similar number of local residents. Such a positivity rate had the potential to rapidly cause an “uptick in cases”, he had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/contrary-to-states-claim-of-55k-data-reveals-barely-5k-covid-tests-done-per-day-in-haridwar/articleshow/81738890.cms||Ishita Mishra

Some of the state BJP functionaries even took off their shirts while protesting outside the gate of the chief minister’s residence and demanded immediate dismissal of the Congress government in Punjab for failing to protect the dignity of an elected legislator. Condemning the incident in which Narang was roughed up allegedly by a group of farmers when he had gone to Malout to address a press conference on Saturday, Sharma said never in the history of electoral politics has such an unfortunate incident taken place. “This is ugly politics and no human being from the opposition will also condone it. The Congress is responsible for this gory act and is indulging in politics of pettiness and using the farmers’ garb while attacking the BJP,” he added. After submitting the memorandum to Punjab governor V P Singh Badnore, the BJP state president said BJP had faced the Maintenance of Internal Security Act (Misa) during the emergency and did not bow down to the Congress. “Again BJP faced many dire challenges during militancy and came out of it with dignity and self respect. The Congress party should be under no illusion that it can throttle our voice of dissent. We will not be intimidated and our voice cannot be muffled,” said Sharma. The forces which want to destroy the peace, harmony and brotherhood between Hindus and Sikhs would be defeated, he added. Another former cabinet minister Tikshan Sood said, “BJP leaders are being targeted. There is no sign of democracy in the state. We came here to tell the CM that he is not capable of running the state and should resign.” Union minister of state Som Prakash, former cabinet minister Madan Mohan Mittal, former state BJP president Shwait Malik, BJP’s national spokesperson and former IPS officer Iqbal Singh Lalpura and state BJP general secretaries Dinesh Sharma and Jevan Gupta were part of the protest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/bjp-demands-dismissal-of-congress-govt/articleshow/81740145.cms||---
---||Delhi||Heritage corridor: Fresh bid to break wall of uncertainty||NEW DELHI: After redevelopment of the 1.2km main stretch in Chandni Chowk, work on the “heritage corridor” is also picking up pace. The Public Works Department (PWD) has floated tenders for appointing a consultant to redevelop the 9.3-km stretch from Kashmere Gate to Jama Masjid Road. A meeting was held last month by urban development and PWD minister Satyendar Jain to expedite the project. The “Mughal glory and heritage corridor” was conceived in 2009, but it hit many hurdles due to various reasons. The project finally got the government’s approval in 2019. A noted architect’s firm had been appointed, but it recently withdrew from the project. Now, PWD is searching for another consultant. The firm has submitted a detailed project report (DPR) for the corridor, which is pending approval. Bidders can obtain a copy of this DPR and subsequent works could be taken up in continuation of this unapproved report. Once the consultant is appointed, pre-construction work, such as topographical survey, geotechnical investigation and soil testing, would be done. The project would be developed in four phases instead of two as planned earlier. A PWD official said ground work would begin once a consultant was finalised. The project, which also involves streetscaping to beautify the stretch, includes Netaji Subhash Marg, Delhi Gate, Kashmere Gate, the phase-II development of Chandni Chowk Road (facade work) and redevelopment of Jama Masjid Road. The area could be developed under the Shahjahanabad Redevelopment Corporation. The key objective is to develop roads as heritage passages and realign various civic services. The road redevelopment would entail redesigning other facilities, such as IGL pipelines, power cables, telephone and internet wires, stormwater drains, CCTV, Wi-Fi, water supply, traffic management, pedestrian management, solid waste management and public conveniences. For redevelopment of Netaji Subhash Marg, the stretch from Kashmere Gate to Delhi Gate would be developed in parts — from Delhi Gate to Old Iron Bridge (0.8km) to Lothian Bridge (1.4km) to Kashmere Gate ISBT (1.1km). Facades of buildings would be restored on the 1.3-km stretch from Red Fort to Fatehpuri mosque under the second phase of Chandni Chowk redevelopment project. Besides, a 3.2-km stretch encompassing six roads — Nai Sarak from Town Hall to Chawri Bazaar, Ballimaran Road from Ballimaran to Chawri Bazaar Charkewalan, Gali Qasim Jaan from Lal Kuan to Ballimaran, Rodgran from Lal Kuan to Farash Khana police station, Farash Khana-GB Road to Lal Kuan and Lal Kuan Main Road from Sardar Swaroop Singh Chowk to Hari Kari Chowk — would also be developed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/heritage-corridor-fresh-bid-to-break-wall-of-uncertainty/articleshow/81740173.cms||Pankhuri Yadav

A day after the city and district for the first time recorded over 200 fresh Covid-19 cases (239 cases to be precise), Vadodara witnessed another jump with the number of fresh cases in 24 hours crossing the 300-mark. With the addition of 304 new Covid-19 cases by Sunday evening, the total number of Covid-19 positive cases since the beginning of the pandemic has reached 27,321. It took eight days, during the ongoing second wave, for the number of fresh cases to cross 200-mark from the 100-mark which the city and district had registered on March 19. Now, the daily tally has crossed the 300-mark. The results are from 5,124 samples that were tested on Saturday evening. Official death toll, however, stood stagnant at 247 with the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) not declaring any death purely due to Covid-19. Going by VMC’s bulletin, there are 1,223 active cases in the city and the district. Of these, the condition of 972 patients is said to be stable. While 156 patients are requiring oxygen support, 95 others are under ventilator or BI-PAP machine. The number of discharges stood at 120 on Sunday taking the total number of discharges to 25,851.

BJP leaders started gathering at the designated place but activists from farm groups took the effigy and made BJP leaders leave. There were arguments but police intervened and the few BJP leaders who had gathered, left. “When we started reaching the designated chowk, some people were already there. We had kept the effigy outside a shop and it was taken away. They were people from Congress and even the Akali Dal. Then we left the place. Later, police returned the effigy to us and we burnt it,” said BJP Mandal president Dharam Pal Mahajan and BJYM mandal president Piyush Manchanda. “We are not against farmers but it is our right to protest against the Punjab government.

---||Chandigarh||Copies of farm laws burnt on Holi eve, FCI offices to be gheraoed on April 5||Bathinda: Farmers burnt copies of the three contentious farm laws at various places across Punjab on Sunday as a mark of protest on the eve of Holi. Farmers have been holding protests against the BJP-led Central government for over four months at the borders of Delhi. Since then, they have been observing festivals at protest sites. Earlier, in response to the call given by Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, farmers observed bandh across Punjab on March 26. They pledged to continue with the struggle till the Central government repealed the contentious laws. Farm organisation BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokri said copies of the laws were burnt at 42 places in 16 districts of the state, including at the ongoing five-day protest at Adani Group’s dry port in Kila Raipur, district Ludhiana. Sanyukt Kisan Morcha claimed that several “indirect” attempts are being made by the government to end MSP and PDS system. Morcha leaders claimed that for the last several years, FCI budget has been reduced and now the corporation has also changed crop procurement rules. Sanyukt Kisan Morcha has decided to observe April 5 as ‘FCI Bachao Divas’, under which FCI offices across the country will be gheraoed from 11am to 5pm. Sanyukt Kisan Morcha has condemned the bill passed in Haryana Assembly on March 18, alleging that it is aimed at “suppressing agitations and agitators.” They alleged that the law, ‘Haryana recovery of damages to property during disturbance to public order bill, 2021’ contains provisions that would prove fatal to democracy. They claimed the law has been brought about to disturb the farmers’ movement and evade legitimate demands of farmers. They claimed that under the law, the loss of private or public property caused by anyone, anywhere during any movement will be recovered from the agitators.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/copies-of-farm-laws-burnt-on-holi-eve-fci-offices-to-be-gheraoed-on-april-5/articleshow/81740166.cms||---

The gram panchayats and the locals have come out in support of the administration and their measures have begun to yield results.“Lakhmapur village, which adopted the practice of ‘janata curfew’ a few days back, is now showing results. We used to get 25 daily cases in the village with a population of about 15,000. Today, the number has dropped and we are reporting occasional cases,” said Vijay Bhangre, the SDO of Baglan“Nampur village had also announced a janata curfew after the number of cases started growing.

Nagarsul village, which has a rural hospital, has 73 active cases. It has restricted the movement of the citizens. “There were many more cases in Nagarsul. But people have helped bring down the number.

The constituency is going to by-poll on April 17. The counting of votes is on May 2. The  has been necessitated due to the death of TRS sitting MLA Nomula Narsimhaiah in December 2020. The TRS leadership is planning road shows of KTR covering a majority of the mandals in the constituency. As many as nine ministers are being made in charge of Nidamanoor, Gurrampode, Peddavoora, Anumula, Tripuraram, Thirumal- agiri-sagar mandals and a couple of municipalities in the constituency. Though chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has already held a huge public meeting in Haliya during MLC elections, party leaders want KCR to hold one more public meeting in Nagarjuna Sagar constituency to seal the fate of the opposition parties, a senior TRS leader said. While the Congress has fielded its seven-time legislator K Jana Reddy, the TRS and BJP are expected to announce its candidates on Monday. The last day for filing of nominations is Tuesday. TRS president KCR has kept close to his chest the name of the candidate for Nagarjuna Sagar by-poll. However, the talk in TRS circles is that the cadre in Nagarjuna Sagar segment are divided with one section supporting Nomula Bhagat, son of Late Nomula Narsimhaiah and the other section opposing his candidature stating he is a non-local. “A section of party leaders feel that the sympathy factor will work in favour of Nomula Bhagat but the other section of the party have cautioned that the TRS will meet the fate of Dubbak if it banks on sympathy factor. Sympathy factor did not work for the ruling party in Dubbak.” said a TRS leader There is a strong demand to field a local candidate from the BC community. The BCs and STs comprise a majority of the voters in the constituency. The CM is expected to finalise the party candidate based on the multiple surveys he has commissioned to know the prospects of various aspirants. The names of Gutha Sukhender Reddy, Tera Chinnapa Reddy, Koti Reddy, M Ranjit Yadav, K Guruvaiah Yadav and P Srinivas Yadav among others are doing rounds in TRS circles as front runners to get the ticket. However, a senior party leader did not rule out the possibility of KCR pulling our a surprise candidate as he did for the Hyderabad-Ranga Reddy-Mahbubnagar Graduate MLC seat by fielding S Vani Devi, daughter of former Prime Minister Late PV Narasimha Rao, and wrested the seat from BJP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/nsagar-kcr-to-hold-rally-ktr-to-hit-campaign-trail/articleshow/81740179.cms||Roushan Ali

---||Delhi||Thick plumes of smoke rise on Holi eve as section of landfill catches fire||NEW DELHI: A section of Ghazipur landfill site caught fire on Sunday evening, leading to residents in nearby areas complain of high pollution levels as to thick plumes of smoke rose from the waste mound. East Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor Nirmal Jain said that the scale of fire was very small and was controlled within a couple of hours. “A small section of landfill had caught fire due to some combustible material. More than half a dozen excavators working on site were deployed to put out the fire. At the same time, three fire tenders were also called. Our team led by a chief engineer and executive engineers is on site,” the mayor said. Anup Das, a resident in the nearby area, said that such poor conditions exist at a place just few kilometres away from the Parliament. “Imagine how people can survive like this,” he asked Bhalswa and Ghazipur landfills — which often witness fires — have mounds of waste over 50m or almost 10-stories high. Decomposition of organic garbage produces combustible methane gas, which often catches fire. Since the source of the fire is buried tens of meters deep inside the mound and the slopes are almost vertical, the flames become much more difficult to put out. The toxic fumes that these landfills emit include extremely polluting and greenhouse gases — carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfide, dioxins and furans. These are also significantly responsible for Delhi’s deteriorating air quality. A senior official overseeing the operations at the site said that no damage occurred due to the blaze. “We suspect that some ragpicker may have started the fire by mistake,” the official said. Senior officials from department of environment management said that fires were much more frequent a few years ago. However, they claimed that interventions such as levelling of surface and bio-mining have controlled methane formation. “We have also stationed water tankers and excavators on the site. The combustible garbage from top has been removed and slopes have been reformed. Now the possibility of fire has been reduced to a large scale and no fire has been reported in several months,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/thick-plumes-of-smoke-rise-on-holi-eve-as-section-of-landfill-catches-fire/articleshow/81740218.cms||---

It has gone up to 21.4% (March 14-27), well past its peak of July last year. Punjab, Goa, Madhya Pradesh and Puducherry have entered the red zone, too, with their infection rates ranging between 5% and 7%, the highest being 7% in Punjab. Kerala, which has reported over 11 lakh cases so far, the second highest after Maharashtra, has managed to bring its positivity rate below 4% during the last 14-day period. The increase in Maharashtra has been consistent - from 4.7% (January 26-February 8) to 7.7% the following fortnight and 13% during March 1-14. A high positivity rate is indicative of the fact that the state is only testing the sickest and not conducting enough tracing, testing and isolation of patients. As per a World Health Organisation advisory, issued in May last year, governments should consider relaxing lockdown in containment zones only if positivity rate remains 5% or lower for at least 14 days. There are currently four states and a Union Territory that qualify for lockdowns. A study found that Kerala has managed to contain the spread of the virus despite a second wave hitting the state badly. It has brought down the positivity rate from 9% (January 26-February 8) to 7% in the following two-week period, to 4% in the first fortnight of March and to 3.6% (March 14-27). Cases are rapidly growing in Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Karnataka, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/positivity-rate-in-maharashtra-past-its-peak-of-july-20/articleshow/81741108.cms||Pradeep Thakur

City health officials believe that in the current scenario the diamond industry will have to strictly follow the standard operating procedure (SOP) to curb the cases otherwise the situation spiral out of control. Officials claim that a congested working environment and not wearing masks is causing the spread of the infection. Diamond trading usually happens in open areas but social distancing is missing. Diamond trading offices and polishing units don’t have proper ventilation due to security reasons while staff members sit very close to each other.“There is a continuous and sharp rise in Covid-19 cases in diamond hubs of the city. Earlier, the spike was in areas having textile units and attempts were made to keep check in those areas,” said a senior health official in SMC.  Out of total 13,443 random testing done from March 14 to March 28, 398 people were found positive in these zones. In the previous year’s Covid wave, the sharp rise in cases from these areas were recorded after the units were allowed to start operations. “The diamond industry must strictly follow SOP laid out by SMC. We will speed up vaccination too in these areas,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/diamond-hubs-turning-into-coronavirus-hotbeds-again/articleshow/81738955.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

They were sentenced for durations ranging from one to 25 days. “This is a highly dangerous trend as the commuters are putting their lives at risk by driving under the influence of alcohol,” an official said, adding that all the booked persons would have to appear before the court for final disposal of the case where they would be penalised. Their driving licenses would be forwarded to the Regional Transport Office concerned for suspension as per law. All those caught were produced before the court, which imposed fines of Rs 2,109,000 on them. The Cyberabad traffic police urged citizens to exhibit self-discipline and responsibility while driving. Officials said that from now onwards, not just drunk driving, but travelling with someone who is driving after drinking can also be considered an offence. The decision was taken after the traffic police noticed that most of the motorists driving in an inebriated condition had someone accompanying them on bikes, cars and other heavy vehicles. “Instead of stopping the person who drives after getting drunk, these people are accompanying them. In cases of road crashes, not only the driver but also the pillion rider or passengers in the vehicles too were losing lives,” said SM Vijay Kumar, DCP (Traffic), Cyberabad. It was further informed that any person found to be travelling along with drunk people will be booked under Section 188 (Punishment for Abetment of Offences) of The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/131-persons-caught-in-a-week-for-drunken-driving-sent-to-jail-in-city/articleshow/81740209.cms||---

At the same time, processions of Veers are also an annual feature in the old city area. These processions pass through the jurisdictions of the Bhadrakali, Sarkarwada and Panchavati police stations and also attract large crowds. Given the Covid-19 situation, the police have banned all gatherings, social, religious and political programmes. Further, the weekly markets and all establishments would remain closed in the Ramkund and Godaghat areas from Monday 12.01 am to Tuesday 12 noon. The festival of Rang panchami, meanwhile, is celebrated enthusiastically every year in the Panchavati area, especially at the ancient rahads (ponds) at Shani Chowk and beneath the Gadge Maharaj bridge. This year, Rang Panchami falls on a Friday. Therefore, the city police have issued prohibitory orders banning all programmes within 50 metres of both the ancient ponds and also establishments from 12.01 am to 11 pm on April 2.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/prohibitory-orders-for-holi-in-nashik-city/articleshow/81738519.cms||---

With Telangana health department asking all those above 60 years, people with comorbidities and children to celebrate Holi with caution, several housing societies and resident organisations urged its members to avoid public gatherings in the premises of their apartment complexes and gated communities while celebrating the festival. Rajendra Prasad, president of Sai Vijaya Apartment Complex in Moti Nagar said, “With constant advisories from the government, people have stopped stepping out of their houses unless it is necessary. We have also sent residents a notice asking them to stay indoors and not to encourage their children to play Holi outdoors.” Some Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) had planned small Holi events, while following all necessary Covid protocols. “We will not have any celebration in the common area of our apartment. We have been asked by the general secretary of our apartment to take necessary precautions,” said RWA member of Srinivasa Apartments, Tarnaka. Meanwhile, in Begum Bazaar, shops that sell gulal, pichkaris and other items are stocked up for the festival, but the widespread scare of coronavirus seems to have taken a toll on the business of Holi festival. “Since many are seen roaming the streets without masks, we are still hopeful. I think people will start coming for colours by evening,” said Rajkumar Singh. On the other hand, event organisers are being forced to cancel their events or slash prices as regular party-goers are avoiding crowded areas. Entry fee for events at hotels, which would cost Rs 1,500, is now priced at Rs 1,000. Varun Kumar, founder of an event management company, said, “There have been only a handful of bookings and enquiries for Holi parties.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/amid-covid-19-case-surge-it-will-be-a-low-key-holi-in-city/articleshow/81740197.cms||---

Though the driver who caused the second accident was sober, the ASI suffered serious injuries as he fell on the road. Both drivers were held. A Kukatpally traffic police team, under the supervision of SI B Sakram, set up a DD checkpoint near Kolan Raghava Reddy Function Hall in Nizampet on Saturday night. At 11.40pm, a driver of a car travelling towards Nizampet from Kukatpally stopped the vehicle little before the checkpoint and tried to reverse the vehicle to escape. “The car driver, Srujan, initially hit a tree and then drove forward through the barricades to escape and, in the process, hit home guard Prahlad and a woman, Tanuja, a pillion rider. Prahlad and Tanuja suffered minor injuries,” KPHB inspector S Laxmi Narayana said. The car came to a halt after hitting the barricades set up by police. Police took car driver Srujan, a software employee, into custody while his friend, Pavan, fled from the spot. “Srujan and Pavan had consumed alcohol,” he said. “When the ASI was inspecting the accident spot, a cab proceeding towards Nizampet hit the ASI due to speeding. The ASI suffered bleeding injuries. He is critical,” the inspector said. “We booked two separate cases against Srujan and cabbie Aslam and arrested them,” DCP (traffic) Vijay Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/asi-critical-after-cab-rams-him/articleshow/81740219.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Girl may have died while playing: Telangana cops||HYDERABAD: Saidabad police probing the reasons behind the death of a nine-year-old girl, who died under suspicious circumstances five days ago, on Sunday said that as per the prima facie findings of the post-mortem examination, there is no foul play and it could be a case of a playful act going wrong. Though the incident took place on Tuesday, it came to light on Sunday. Saidabad police said that as per the complaint given by the girl’s parents, when they went out for work, the couple’s three children were at their hut along with a few more children of the same locality. By the time the girl’s mother returned, there were locals who gathered at their hut. When she enquired, the mother was told that her elder daughter was found dead. The locals observed that there was ligature injury on her neck. Based on a complaint lodged by her family members, a case of suspicious death was registered. “The children told police that the 9-year-old girl twice tried to arrange the loop using a skipping wire at a particular place in their hut, but later chose another location and hanged herself in front of them,” Saidabad inspector K Srinivas said. According to the police, the deceased’s younger sister, who is 5 years old, climbed on to a stool and cut the wire using a knife and the deceased fell down. Immediately, the other children alerted their neighbours, who reached the place and saw the girl dead. Officials said that they are suspecting that the girl might have done a playful act to threaten her brother, as he was forcing her to take him to a local temple. “As of now, we do not know the reason why she hanged herself. There is a possibility that her playful act to control her brother might have proved costly. Earlier, she threatened him that she will hang herself if he joins her at the temple,” Srinivas said. Police are awaiting the final post-mortem report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/girl-may-have-died-while-playing-cops/articleshow/81740223.cms||---
---||Surat||Surat cops to invoke stricter sections against bakery owner||SURAT: The city police have approached the court to add stringent section of culpable homicide not amounting to murder against Atul Vekariya, owner of Atul Bakery, who knocked to death a 29-year-old woman Urvashi Chaudhary with his SUV near JH Ambani School on Friday night. Earlier, police had booked Vekariya for causing death by negligence and it is a bailable section of Indian Penal Code due to which he got bail a few hours after his arrest. However, due to criticism from various sections of society and social media, a stringent section is now being added. “Police have approached court to add stricter sections in the FIR and he will be arrested again. If required, we will seek his custody for questioning as well,” said a police officer in Umra police station. Police are likely to add sections for drunk driving as well since he was allegedly under influence of liquor. Cops are yet to investigate where Vekariya had consumed liquor and from where he was returning. They are also awaiting the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) report about Vekariya’s medical test.  Vekariya had rammed his SUV into Chaudhary, who was sitting on her moped parked by the roadside. One more moped was also knocked by the SUV. The SUV’s road was blocked by both two-wheelers due to which Vekariya could not escape from the spot.  Vekariya was booked under various sections of the Indian Penal Code including 304A (causing death by negligence), 337 (causing hurt by negligent act), 338 (causing grievous hurt by negligent act) and 279 (rash driving). He was also booked under sections of the Motor Vehicle Act as well. Vekariya was released on bail on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/surat-cops-to-invoke-stricter-sections-against-bakery-owner/articleshow/81738969.cms||---

Especially if the haphazard growth along the western corridor continues, they add. “Most cities with extremely tall buildings — like Mumbai or even New York — have a strong public transport system. This is important as, otherwise, they can build tremendous pressure on its road network; even choke it, owing to very high density. Unfortunately, in Hyderabad, where these structures are coming up, public transport networks are missing and that’s a serious concern,” said architect, Srinivas Murthy, while reiterating the need to re-look at the unlimited FSI (Floor Space Index) norm prevalent in Hyderabad — the only city in India to offer it. This allows builders to construct as much as they want on a piece of land, without any cap. “As a result, an area can end up having a higher density (count of residents is higher in taller buildings) than it can handle. In the long run, this can build pressure to other amenities such as water, energy etc,” Murthy added. It is, therefore, important that such tall projects are put through thorough impact assessment studies before being approved, said urban planner and executive director of Hyderabad Urban Lab, Anant Maringanti. “And these studies need to be made public so that we can understand what impact the projects might have on a particular area and advise the authorities accordingly. Right now, these are being approved haphazardly so there is no way one can gauge what the consequences will be until they come up. And by then, it might be too late to rectify the damage,” said Maringanti.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/haphazard-and-high-density-growth-can-choke-city-experts/articleshow/81740222.cms||Sudipta Sengupta

Prasad had unsuccessfully contested from Serilingampally constituency during 2018 assembly polls. According to RC Puram inspector P Jagadeeshwar, a cheating case was registered against Prasad and five others, including his son, Aditya, their business partner, Shiva Kumar, and two of their family members based on a plaint lodged by Kukatpally corporator J Satyanarayana Rao. In 2017, Satyanarayana Rao invested Rs 2 crore in Prasad’s company on promising 4% annual returns. “As the accused failed to fulfill the promise of providing good returns, Satyanarayana asked for his money. However, as the accused failed to fulfill any of their promises, Satyanarayana again insisted for the money and they threatened him,” the inspector said. “We have arrested two accused so far. Rest are absconding,” he said. When contacted, the TDP leaders were unavailable for comment and several calls to them went unanswered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/tdp-leaders-son-held-in-cheating-case/articleshow/81740224.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Outlet told to pay over Rs 15,000 for unfair trade||HYDERABAD: A district consumer forum here on Sunday directed a Brand Factory outlet to pay over Rs 15,000 to a complainant for charging GST on the discounted price of jeans and for selling carry bags with logo. S Umesh Kumar, the complainant, submitted that he visited an outlet of Brand Factory, which offered a 40% discount on garments. Kumar said that he selected jeans, whose printed MRP was Rs 2,499 (inclusive of GST). After deducting a 40% discount, the jeans should have cost Rs 1,499.40, instead, he was charged Rs 1594. 38, Kumar added. The complainant said that in the name of GST, the store has collected an excessive amount of Rs 74.88 from him. He further stated that the store charged Rs 10 on a paper carry bag, which contained the logo of Brand Factory and added that only at the billing counter, customers were informed about the sale of carry bags. Claiming that charging GST on concession MRP and charging for paper carry bag with logo amounts to unfair trade practice, he filed the plaint. The opposite party, in its written version, denied all the allegations made in the complaint. It said that as they have charged GST only on the 40% discount price of the sold goods, which is in accordance with the law, there is no deficiency in service or adoption of unfair trade practice on its part in the said transactions. When it comes to the sale of carry bags with a logo, it claimed that the store has put a display board at the sale point. The bench said that as MRP includes all taxes, charging extra GST again on the discounted price amounts to deficiency in service and adoption of unfair trade practice. It also said that the store should have provided the carry bag to the complainant free of cost. “It should have informed the complainant about carry bag prior to selection of the goods but not at the payment counter as such the action of opposite party amounts to deficiency in service and also adoption of unfair trade practice on its part,” the bench added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/outlet-told-to-pay-over-rs-15k-for-unfair-trade/articleshow/81740227.cms||Nirupa Vatyam
---||Hyderabad||Telugu states had fever hospitals, surgical units 1,700 years ago||HYDERABAD: Andhra Desa, the ancient geographical region that comprises the modern-day Telangana and AP, had exclusive fever hospitals including a few dedicated to treating specific diseases. There was also a provision for female nurses, who were paid handsome salaries. Medical epigraphical data of Telugu states analysed by the researchers at the National Centre for Indian Medical Heritage (NCIMH), Hyderabad, has revealed that the oldest available references to the medical history of the region dates back to the Ikshvaku period (third to fourth century CE). The inscriptions were discovered at Phanigiri in which a reference to the chief physician of the kingdom is made. According to Dr GP Prasad, incharge of NCIMH, Hyderabad, the epigraphical data collected from various places in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh highlights the importance of treatment of various ailments, particularly fever. There was a separate fever hospital at Nagarjuna Konda. The NCIMH conducted a brain-storming session on the inscriptions of medical importance in Telugu states. “Fever is considered as fatal. To take proper care and maintain wholesome food and activities, a separate fever hospital was established at Nagarjuna Konda. This ‘Jwaralaya’ consisted of a closed pillared hall in the centre with rooms all around. The main building has a passage through one of these rooms leading to an enclosure with an open court. There was a veranda running all around the enclosure. The building has proper drainage, urinals, lavatories, septic tanks and is built as per principles of hygiene,” he said. The Nagarjuna Konda inscriptions denote the availability of disease-specialised hospitals with in-patient facility during the period of Acharya Nagarjuna, a Buddhist monk, in Andhra Desa, he said. Prasad said the excavations conducted at Vijayapuri-Nagarjuna Konda showed the structure of a hospital attached to a monastic complex in the early centuries of the Christian era. The term ‘Vihare Mukhya Jwaralaya’ (main fever hospital) found in the inscription excavated at the site reveals the existence of fever hospital attached to the monastery, he added. Referring to the Saidapur Jain inscriptions of early 11th century, he said there’s a reference to Sastra Chikitsa or surgery in Ayurveda methods. It reveals that medical surgery was in a well-developed stage and practiced by experts in Ayurveda those days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/telugu-states-had-fever-hosps-surgical-units-1700-yrs-ago/articleshow/81740230.cms||Syed Akbar

---||Kochi||Module from Dubai to fix snag-hit Ro-Ro vessel||Kochi: Kerala Shipping and Inland Navigation Corporation (KSINC) will import a module from Dubai to replace the snag-hit thruster control panel of the Ro-Ro vessel operating in the Vypeen-Fort Kochi sector. The module, costing around Rs 2 lakh, is expected to reach Kochi this week. KSINC has already issued purchase order to the company. “Service engineers in Mumbai examined the defective portion of the panel through a video call and recommended replacing the existing module with the new one. Though we have not opened the panel, we expect rest of the parts are intact. The product is not available in the Indian market. Once it reaches Kerala, KSINC engineers can fix it in the panel. We hope that the service of the vessel can be resumed by next week,” said a KSINC official. The corporation has spent nearly Rs 3 lakh for repair of the two vessels since the launch of the Ro-Ro service in June 2018. The vessels were built by Cochin Shipyard at a cost of around Rs 3.80 crore. Currently, the snag-hit vessel has been anchored at Vypeen jetty. A similar issue occurred last year too warranting the visit of service engineers from Mumbai. At present, only one vessel is operating in the stretch. To address the travel woes of passengers, KSINC on Wednesday resumed the service of Fort Queen, a boat which was in service on the route until six months ago. The Fort Kochi-Vypeen ferry passengers’ association had been constantly pressing for the resumption of the boat service. They also said the corporation is going slow on the repair of the vessel. “It has been two weeks since the vessel’s service was suspended due to the technical snag. Though the service of Fort Queen has resumed from Wednesday afternoon, the delay in repairing the vessel puts heavy toll on motorists. The passengers can use the boat service. With the launch of Ro-Ro vessels, the numbers of motorists especially the bike riders using the ferry service has increased. There will be around 100 bikes to board the vessel at a time in peak hours. With only one vessel operating services, the motorists are forced to wait for long,” said Francis Chammany, president of the association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/module-from-dubai-to-fix-snag-hit-ro-ro-vessel/articleshow/81739603.cms||---

While talking about converting waste into value, Modi cited the example of the students of St Teresa’s who are making reusable toys in the college.Modi said the students make toys from used clothes and wooden pieces in a creative and child-friendly manner. He said while India is moving forward in the manufacturing of toys, such campaigns and ingenious experiments mean a lot.“We have all seen, heard about converting waste into wealth. In the same way, efforts of converting waste to value are also being attempted. One such example is that of St Teresa’s College in Kochi, Kerala. Students are converting old clothes, discarded wooden pieces, bags and boxes into toys like puzzles, cars and even train. Here, special attention is paid to ensure that the toys are safe as well as child-friendly. And a good thing about this whole effort is that these toys are given to the anganwadi children,” Modi said in his speech.The toy making initiative was started by the Teresian Innovation and Business Incubation Centre (TIBIC). The toys were later gifted to the students of an anganwadi at Fort Kochi.“It is an honour to be appreciated by the Prime Minister. We are planning to expand the project of converting waste, mainly the tailoring waste, into soft toys to a commercial level. We have approached the Kochi corporation seeking their support,” said TIBIC coordinator Nirmala Padmanabhan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/modi-all-praise-for-reusable-toy-initiative-of-st-teresas/articleshow/81739612.cms||---

His 29-year-old son is also Covid-19 positive. Meanwhile, a total of 21 people have tested Covid-19 positive in Agra district on Sunday, when 1,446 people were fund positive across the state. Agra district chief medical officer (CMO) RC Pandey said, “The VC suffered a mild fever on Saturday, following which his throat swab sample was sent for RT-PCR testing at the microbiology lab in SN Medical College. He was tested positive on Sunday. His son has also been tested for the coronavirus infection. They are kept in home isolation and are being provided the required treatment. People who came in contact with them will also be tested.” Confirming that the VC was administered the first dose of coronavirus vaccine, the CMO said, “Vaccines don’t work instantly. It takes a few weeks for the body to build immunity after receiving a dose. And, the vaccines now in use require a second shot a few weeks after the first one to be fully effective.” Sharad Gupta, a senior Agra-based doctor, said, “The vaccines prevent illness, but maybe not infection. Covid-19 vaccines are being authorised based on how well they keep you from getting sick. It is not clear yet how effective the vaccines are at preventing the coronavirus from infecting you, to begin with, or at keeping you from passing it on to others. That is why vaccinated people should keep wearing masks and maintain social distance.” The health department in Agra district is on alert after three people were detected with the South African strain of coronavirus and another individual with the new mutated strain on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/agra-univ-vc-tests-covid-ve-9-days-after-first-dose-of-vaccine/articleshow/81738994.cms||Deepak Lavania

Talking to reporters at Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar international airport, the home minister, who arrived in the city to review Covid situation, said he had requested chief minister Uddhav Thackeray during a recently held cabinet meeting to probe accusations by Singh, after he was shunted as director general, home guards. Deshmukh had also written a letter to the CM around a week ago requesting him for a probe to ensure ‘Doodh ka Doodh, paani ka paani’ (separate the truth from lie) into the allegations by Singh. Deshmukh had also stated that he soon would file a defamation case against the Param Bir Singh. “Following my request, the CM has ordered inquiry to be conducted by a retired judge of high court,” said the home minister. Singh had accused Deshmukh of pressuring police officers to collect Rs100 crore for him from bars and such places in Mumbai. Singh had also claimed that the home minister had interfered and insisted on Mumbai police registering a case after BJP MP from Dadra and Nagar Haveli Mohan Delkar was found dead in the metropolis. Interestingly, NCP supremo Sharad Pawar had trashed the charges against Deshmukh saying he was in home quarantine during the period when Singh had claimed the home minister had met police officers to demand money. Singh had subsequently filed a case before the Supreme Court requesting for a probe against Deshmukh, but the apex court had directed him to approach the high court. The home minister too had protested against the allegations by Singh asking why the senior officer vented his ire only after being removed as Mumbai CP. Deshmukh had also dubbed all charges against him as malicious. Deshmukh had stated that he was hospitalized between February 5 and 15 after testing Covid positive and later was in home quarantine till February 27 and stepped out for the first time for work on the following day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/retired-hc-judge-to-probe-charges-against-me-deshmukh/articleshow/81740269.cms||Soumitra Bose

---||Kochi||Natpac suggests crash-prevention steps at Elamkulam||Kochi: A draft report prepared by the National Transportation Planning and Research Centre (Natpac) team has recommended to bring down the speed limit of vehicles at Elamkulam from 50km/hr to 40km/hr. The stretch witnessed seven accidents in the past seven months in which nine motorists were killed.The report, submitted to the Kerala Road Safety Authority, also recommends redesigning of the busy Elamkulam Junction. Five of the seven accidents were involving two-wheelers and most of them were caused by the vehicles hitting Metro pillar or median. Vehicles either overturned or ran off in such accidents.“These factors show that the road has issues which need to be rectified. In order to bring down the impact of crash, we recommended median barrier, though it won’t prevent risk. Sign boards suggesting design speed of 40 km/hr and caution board should be installed. Even if CCTVs are installed, it should be fixed to capture vehicles plying above the speed limit of 40km/hr. Besides standard road signs and markings, blinkers near crash-prone areas should also be ensured. Footpath should also be provided between Elamkulam Junction and Metro station. Around 100 to 150m footpath should be provided near Metro station in order to enhance Metro ridership and pedestrian safety,” said Natpac scientist Ebin Sam. “These traffic arrangements should be put in place in the 350-m stretch between the Junction and the Metro station,” he added.Bar markings, speed barrier and reflective rumble strips have already been installed by the police and motor vehicles department. “The departments concerned who own the road should do the engineering solutions needed in the area. Kochi corporation owns the road and PWD road safety cell has responsibility. In view of this the report has been submitted to road safety authority to coordinate the work and release fund. The area also need long-term measures including evaluation study on the cause of accidents. Besides, Kochi Metro corridor also needs road safety audit since the police said that some locations on the corridor witness rise in accidents. There are also some dangerous U-turns along the corridor,” said Sam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/natpac-suggests-crash-prevention-steps-at-elamkulam/articleshow/81739721.cms||---

The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and Zilla Parishad (ZP) have continued record number of tests in the district, with 1,11,113 tests conducted in last seven days. The one lakh weekly test figure was first crossed in third week of March, when 1,02,804 tests happened between March 15 and 21. Despite increase in number of tests, test positivity rate (TPR) increased in third week of March. TPR was 23.17%, which is at par with September last year. Due to surge in cases, number of active cases is going up each day.

CFR is less compared to August, September and October of last year. In the review meeting by home minister Anil Deshmukh on Sunday, officials said next 15 days were very crucial for the district as any increase in cases is likely to precipitate crisis of beds and push up deaths.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/except-sept-last-year-26k-cases-last-week-beat-every-months-total/articleshow/81740350.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Corp to streamline land acquisition procedure||Thiruvananthapuram: With the local self-government department (LSGD) issuing fresh set of conditions for giving clearance for land acquisition, the city corporation will have to take into account aspects related to ecological fragility and coastal regulation zone (CRZ) while submitting details to the department. The LSGD recently issued a circular on filing applications for land acquisition in the wake of incomplete and inaccurate nature of applications being submitted by local bodies. This has led to delay in land acquisition procedures and it would further lead to hike in land price causing financial loss to the local body and the state government, the circular says. The local bodies have now been asked to submit applications for land acquisition in a new pro forma with relevant documents, including clearance regarding ecologically fragile zone and coastal regulation zone. In addition to basic information like need for land acquisition, approval of district planning committee and approximate expenditure required, the local bodies will have to attribute the source of fund, nature of land, litigation associated with the land and encumbrance details. The officials associated with city corporation said that there had been instances in the past when the civic body failed to complete proper acquisition of land owing to lack of proper information. “Most often, the land in question will be encroached and it will lead to litigation. Going ahead with a project proposal without that kind of information will impede the progress of schemes. It may or may not involve acquisition but knowledge regarding such matters is crucial,” an official said. Over the past few years, the civic body had to abandon major projects envisaged in the budget after its own land being encroached by private parties and religious organizations. A project to begin a training centre on 3.5 acres at Beemapally was shelved after the officials were told that the land proposed for the project belongs to a religious group. The plan to start an industrial centre on 8.5 acres at Pappanamcode was cancelled after encroachment was reported on the same site. The city corporation’s dream project of having its own petrol pump and a shopping complex at Jagathy was aborted following a notification from the revenue department which said that the land belonged to the revenue department and not to the corporation. Although the land was transferred to the ownership of corporation in the past in return for another piece of land, the civic body did not possess any document to prove this. The civic body has been trying to acquire land mainly for housing scheme in the past three years. In the wake of new guidelines, corporation will have to consider factors related to nature of land, zone, and ecological fragility. The ruling councils had not been able to identify land for sanitation and commercial purposes in the recent past.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/corp-to-streamline-land-acquisition-procedure/articleshow/81739734.cms||Aswin J Kumar

The labour department has removed 489 beneficiaries from the list of Building and Other Construction Workers (BOCW) and has shifted 14 individuals to the employment exchange list as they were “wrongly registered” as construction workers. Labour and employment minister Jennifer Monserrate informed the legislators that the 489 beneficiaries failed to produce documents to back their claim of being construction workers. However, the department has succeeded in recovering funds from 12 individuals who were not entitled to receive the funds. “Notices had been issued to all the labour inspectors for re-verification of ineligible beneficiaries registered with the GBOCW Board,” said Monserrate in response to a written question raised by GFP president Vijai Sardesai.  “14 beneficiaries have been transferred from BOCW list to employment exchange as they were wrongly registered under BOCW,” she said.GFP was the first to blow the lid on the siphoning of funds meant for labourers as part of the Covid-19 relief scheme for BOCW. GFP pursued the matter with the Goa Lokayukta and just a day ahead of his retirement as Goa Lokayukta, Justice (retd) P K Misra directed the anti-corruption bureau (ACB) to investigate the case and to file an FIR against those involved. In the order, Misra tore into government officials, politicians and high-ranking officials and even suggested that the investigation should be handed over to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The BJP-led government has entrusted the investigation to the Anti-Corruption Bureau, which is headed by the chief minister. GFP had alleged that the state government had misused the scheme to channel the funds to BJP functionaries, including some village sarpanch and panchs.

In his weekly column in the Sena mouthpiece Saamna, Raut said Deshmukh got the home portfolio only because other potential NCP candidates like Jayant Patil and Dilip Walse-Patil were not ready to accept this crucial post. Within hours of the piece appearing, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar reacted sharply and advised Raut that no one should play "spoilsport" when the three-party government (Sena-NCP-Congress) was functioning properly. Terming the home portfolio a "prestigious" one, Raut wrote that the home minister should "not be working in the company of suspects". "The police department has already been defamed, and on top of it, such things raise doubts. Deshmukh got into trouble with some senior officials for no reason. Home minister should speak the least, only if necessary, once in a while, and keep a distance from the media. The one heading the police department is not there just to receive a 'salute' but is meant to offer strong leadership. How can we forget that such toughness comes from honesty?" he said. Raut also sought an inquiry into "unlimited power" given to arrested police official Sachin Waze when he was only an officer of the rank of assistant police inspector. "If Waze was extorting money while sitting in the police commissionerate, then why was the home minister not aware of it?" questioned the Sena functionary. He also pointed out that the "extortionist" API was defended initially in the state legislature. However, no one was ready to respond after Param Bir Singh made allegations against Deshmukh. Subsequently, the "media was taken over by opposition leaders for some time, which was terrible", said the Sena MP. Raut further said that there were a "few loopholes" in the state governance, stating that MVA alliance does not have any mechanism for "damage control". He said that no one came forward from the government side to respond to allegations made by Singh, who in his letter to the chief minister, accused the home minister of asking Waze to collect Rs 100 crore every month from bars and restaurants in Mumbai. Raut also stated that some of the incidents that have occurred in the last few months raised questions on the "character" of Maharashtra. Pawar also told the media in Baramati that the allotment of cabinet berths is the prerogative of the chief of every ruling party in the coalition government and a similar method is being followed by Congress and Shiv Sena. He suggested to Raut that the allotment of portfolio should be respected instead of making unwarranted comments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/deshmukh-accidental-home-minister-says-senas-raut/articleshow/81741119.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar

Immigration experts anticipate a spike when visa appointments open up for the main admission season post July. The Covid-19 pandemic had resulted in a 55% dip in 2020 with around 2.6 lakh students going abroad compared to nearly 5.9 lakh in 2019, according to the ministry of external affairs. Most students in 2021 are from Andhra Pradesh (11,790) and Maharashtra (10,166), while Punjab, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka also saw hundreds of them. These six states accounted for more than 59% (42,661 students). ‘Last year, many didn’t process visas in Sept’Last year, many students did not process their visas in the usual September season. They did one semester here and processed their visas in January 2021 and went abroad. Also, not too many visa appointments were available during the admission season last year although countries did prioritise student visas,” Poorvi Chothani, founder and managing partner, LawQuest, a global immigration law fir m, said. Echoing Chothani’s views, Sumeet Jain, co-founder, Yocket, said: “Most students could be attending spring semesters in the US and Canada as the UK and Australia-New Zealand have not opened up yet. While visas for the US opened last October, many students couldn’t go. These numbers reflect existing demand. The numbers will see spike in the second half this year.” In five years before 2021, nearly 22 lakh Indian students went abroad for studies and nearly a quarter were from Andhra Pradesh and Punjab. Six states — Andhra Pradesh, Punjab, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka — account for 56% of all students going abroad. Chothani sees many students wanting to go abroad in September 2021. “Those who took a gap year because of Covid will be part of this year’s departures in addition to the current batch. There could be a 42% increase, compared to 2019, in students going to the US,” Chothani added. Till January 2021, there were over 10.9 lakh Indians studying in 85 countries. Most were in Canada and the US, followed by the UAE, Australia, the UK, China. Germany and France.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/72000-students-go-abroad-this-year-after-55-dip-in-2020/articleshow/81741127.cms||Chethan Kumar

The process for appointment of a chairman and members has been undertaken, chief minister Pramod Sawant told the House in a written reply to the question tabled by opposition leader Digambar Kamat during Question Hour recently. “Nominations received from the high court of Bombay at Goa for the post of chairman, and from Goa Human Rights Commission and Goa Public Service Commission (GPSC) for appointment of members, are under consideration of the government,” the chief minister said. Since the constitution of the SPCA in 2007, it has received 548 complaints. Of these, in 89 cases the inquiries were completed and the orders passed. Ten new cases are pending for registration. In November 2020, the government shut down the three-member SPCA, while the term of its last chairman Justice (Retd) R M S Khandeparkar’s ended in April 2018. Although the two other members conducted hearings, they were unable to pass orders without a chairman. A majority of the complaints that are filed before the complaints body are pertaining to police refusing to register first information reports (FIRs).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/reconstituting-of-spca-is-under-way-says-cm/articleshow/81740630.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Several parishes have decided to carry on as scheduled with services and Easter midnight mass with all the SOPs they have been following till date, unless they receive any orders from the archdiocese or further clarification from the government. Many are also having additional services so that more people get an opportunity to participate in services, while maintaining SOPs. “The Section 144 order uses the word festivities, but these are liturgical services and not festivities. The Church is also not a public place, but a private place where people are coming for worship and not festivities. The circular is not clear,” a parish priest. “The Holy week is a time for prayer, fasting and sacrifice and as long we follow SOPs of six feet distancing, santisation and wearing mask there should bee no objection. We are going to continue with our plan for all services and even midnight mass as these are not festivities,” the parish priest added. A senior official from the Archbishop’s palace said that no circular has been issued to Churches as they are already following SOPs. “Services will continue as usual by strictly observing all necessary precautions,” the official said. Many have decided to skip the traditional washing of the feet on Maundy Thursday and the kissing of the cross on Good Friday. “The washing of the feet is not liturgical, it is just a commemoration of what Jesus had done during that time. We will be avoiding anything that is unnecessary during the pandemic. On Good Friday too, the faithful will be made to kneel or stand and pray in silence and venerate the cross from wherever their places instead of the 40-minute kissing of the cross tradition,” parish priest of Benaulim said. Parochial administrator at Siolim’s St Anthony Church, Fr Clifford Castellino said he foresaw the Covid-19 situation getting bad and had pre-empted restrictions from the government. “We are playing it by ear. We have already kept three plans ready and the fourth is a total shutdown. For me this not a festival or entertainment as stated in the circular, but we are ready for whatever the situation. We have prepared short liturgies for people to follow at home. They can get together and follow them. They are self explanatory,” he said. Others said they were not sure whether to go strictly by the Section 144 order or read between the lines. One parish priest was quick to see the mixed signals from the government. “A day after the circular the chief minister inaugurated a mega gala exhibition. That should be stopped. Tourists should be stopped from coming to Goa. So many of them have flocked here because of the long weekend. The government itself is confused and they’re just trying to curb religious services,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/clergy-to-go-ahead-with-holy-week-masses-say-will-avoid-non-liturgical-observations/articleshow/81740619.cms||Lisa Monteiro

---||Goa||Mechanised farming to get major boost||Margao: With a view to promote mechanised farming, the state government has prepared an action plan setting out short, middle and long-term goals. In a reply to an unstarred question by the leader of Opposition Digambar Kamat, agriculture minister Chandrakant Kavlekar said the targets will be achieved through strategic planning in a phased manner.  Among the short term goals to be achieved by 2021 are creation of five farm machinery banks in addition to 110 available in the state, and subsidising three harvesters to the targeted group of registered farmers, agriculture societies and NGOs with the objective of accentuating paddy cultivation. Increasing farm machinery banks and Custom Hiring Centres by 12 by 2023, and promoting mechanised transplanting of paddy by creating two service providers equipped with all infrastructural facilities, in addition to seven service providers available in the state, constitute the middle term goals. The long term goals, aimed to be achieved by 2025 are: addition of 15 Custom Hiring Centres in the state, thus taking the total to 125 centres “so as to increase the reach of farm mechanisation to small and marginal farmers of every taluka.” As per the action plan, the agriculture department will adopt two-fold strategies to achieve the objectives - providing financial assistance to farmers/groups etc for procurement of farm machinery and implements, and providing financial support to small and marginal farmers for hiring machinery and equipment from established farm machinery banks. The objectives of the action plan are stated to be as follows: Promotion of mechanization to overcome shortage and high cost of labour, reducing cost of cultivation of crops and increasing net return to farmers, reducing drudgery of farmers, especially farm women, and bringing mechanization within reach of the common farmer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mechanised-farming-to-get-major-boost/articleshow/81729195.cms||---
---||Goa||Virus steals colour from Holi, Goa parties cancelled||PANAJI: Afroz Sayed, a DJ by profession, was signed up to perform at six Holi parties on Monday. However, all the six events were cancelled due to concerns surrounding the spike in Covid-19 cases in Goa in the last few days. “I received back-to-back calls from the organisers to inform me that their respective events will not be taking place,” he said. Within minutes, his packed schedule was reduced to a day devoid of work. The state government on Friday announced the imposition of Section 144 to curb the spread of the virus due to potential crowding thus leading to the cancellation of parties across the state. As a precautionary measure, celebrations for Shigmotsav, Easter and Shab-e-Barat were also called off. The Festival of Colours party annually held at SinQ nightclub by Bull’s Eye Entertainment was cancelled soon after the state government made the announcement. “The decision was timely since the safety of the people is more important than a music festival. We are currently in a pandemic, so we cannot help it,” Bull’s Eye Entertainment’s event planner Siggy D’Souza said. The Uraki festival had scheduled a waterless Holi celebration at the Cajini multipurpose lawn that was supposed to run for 12 hours – 10 am to 10pm. The festival was cancelled two days prior to the scheduled date. “While this decision may be sudden, we take the safety and health of our guests, staff and community very seriously,” a statement released by the organisers read. They also promised to host the festival at a later date and assured that the ticket purchased will “automatically be applied to the rescheduled event”. Other parties that were cancelled are Holi Hai at Majestic Pride, Rang De, Colour Nation, Holika and Colourholic. The organisers are getting a pat on their back from the locals for making a responsible move, but due to lack of sponsorship this year, many of the small-time organisers that were dependent on the ticketed events to recover their investment are bound to face losses. “Right from the planners of the small Holi party at Little Field, Taleigao, costing Rs 3.5 lakh to the organisers of grand ones like Colourland Goa at Nazri that is estimated to cost Rs 10-12 lakh or the Uraki festival costing about 20 lakh, everyone’s losing money due to cancellations,” Sayed said. Some of these parties have even paid their vendors, while others had artistes flying in from neighbouring states to perform live. “Their hotel accommodation, flight tickets, taxi, etc, have been paid for and cannot be refunded. We have no choice but to bear the losses,” an organiser said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/virus-steals-colour-from-holi-parties-cancelled/articleshow/81740724.cms||Nida Sayed

Of the 55 weeks since the outbreak in the state, the number of cases a week crossed the 12,000-mark in 19 weeks during the peak between July first week and mid-November. The surge in the past week is the 20th week where such high numbers have been recorded. The second wave trend appears similar to the first: In the first 17 weeks from March 9, 2020, cases were under 12,000, but it spiked between July 6 and 12 last year. That week alone saw 16,264 fresh cases. Now, after 18 weeks (between November 16, 2020 to March 21, 2021) of cases remaining under control, the number has crossed 12,000/ week again. “Compared to just 1.5% nationally, the positivity rate in Karnataka is 1.6%, which is not good,” admitted K Sudhakar, health minister. “People must comply with guidelines on masks, physical distancing and everyone eligible should get vaccinated.Containment measures are already in place and gradually, even tighter action will be initiated. The Centre has asked all chief ministers to review the situation in various educational institutions,” he added. As on Sunday, the state had a caseload of 9,87,012, of which more than 85% of the cases came in the 19 weeks that included the weeks during the peak and the tail-end of that phase when new infections began to decline. The other 36 weeks together, including the past six days, have only seen 15% of the cases but experts say that if the second wave is as severe as the first and the last week is the beginning of a new peak, then numbers are expected to spiral. Caution neededDr V Ravi, nodal officer for genome sequencing of SARSCoV2 and a member of the technical advisory committee, agreed with the assessment and advised caution. “The reproductive number (R. No) has touched 1.6, that is, for every 100 people infected, another 160 will get infected,” Dr Ravi said. “For many months before March, the R. number of R-naught was under one, and now it has gone back to the levels of the peak in 2020.” Virologists like Dr Ravi and epidemiologists like Dr Giridhara Babu have been pointing to the R. No. and advocating enhanced Covidappropriate behaviour. Ravi, in fact, urged the government to enforce guidelines more strictly like it did last year and warned that if the government doesn’t act now, the spike in infections will overwhelm the healthcare system and result in more deaths. Chief secretary P Ravi Kumar, in an order dated March 27, had asked BBMP and all district administrations “to ensure public gatherings and congregations during the upcoming religious festivals like Ugadi, Holi, Shab-e-Barat, Good Friday, etc shall not be allowed in public places, grounds, parks, markets, religious places, etc in the state”. The order adds that jathras (fairs) associated with different religious festivals shall not be allowed in public places.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/karnataka-for-first-time-since-mid-november-weekly-cases-surge-past-12000/articleshow/81742018.cms||Chethan Kumar

In an order dated March 25, Corporation of the City of Panaji commissioner Sanjit Rodrigues has asked the bank branch to demolish the mezzanine floor and remove the diesel generator from the sixth floor, which was placed without prior permission. Rodrigues issued the directive as per provisions of Section 269 of the City of Panaji Corporation Act 2002 “I direct the respondent to demolish or remove the said illegal work, within 28 days from the date of receipt of this notice, failing which I shall cause the work of demolition and further, the expenses incurred thereof will be recovered as arrears of property tax,’ Rodrigues said in the order. A resident of the building had complained to the directorate of fire and emergency services and the CCP in 2018 that Bicholim Urban Co-operative Bank had enclosed part of open space and toilet on the ground floor of the building and also put up a mezzanine floor without prior permission from Corporation of the City Panaji. “It appears that the said construction work is done without obtaining prior permission or approval as required under Section 257(1) and in violation of provisions,” Rodrigues said in the order. The plan, which was approved by Corporation of the City of Panaji while granting construction and occupancy licences clearly indicates that the generator was to be placed on the ground floor along with the toilet block.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bicholim-bank-told-to-break-illegal-structure/articleshow/81740731.cms||---

The special cell got a tipoff on Fajja’s hideout at 9pm Saturday. A crack team of 24 cops, backed by a SWAT squad, reached the society at 1.20am, secured the residents and rang the bell of the flat. The door was opened, police barged in and Fajja started firing. Two cops were hit, but saved by their bulletproof vests. Fajja soon went down and was declared dead in hospital. Fajja opened fire as cops rushed in after ringing the bell thriceJust after escaping from police custody at Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, Fajja went to a contact, Bhupender Bhuttan, in outer Delhi, collected money and headed towards Rohini according to the directions given to him. Fajja was holed up with his aide Yogender Dahiya for two days at a flat in Tulsi Apartment in Rohini’s Sector 14 and tracking news on his escape, but didn’t use phones or internet, deputy commissioner of police (Special Cell) Pramod Kushwaha claimed. All this while, a team of officers led by ACP Lalit Mohan Negi and Hriday Bhushan from the New Delhi Range of the Special Cell started tracking Fajja and his associates. The cops received a tipoff about Bhuttan and detained him on Saturday evening. It was he who gave police the location of Fajja’s hideout around 9pm. While a surveillance team furtively kept watch at the housing society and the flat since 10pm, the main assault team comprising the two ACPs and inspectors Sunil Rajain and Ravinder Joshi along with 20 others reached the apartment at around 1.20am. The guards at the gate were asked to co-operate and adjacent residents were secured after the presence of “two suspicious men” was confirmed in the flat located on the ground floor. The cops rang the bell thrice — a pre-decided code — of the flat. Once the cops rushed in, Fajja started firing at them from his pistol after taking cover. The cops shot back, and he soon fell on the floor after getting hit. He was taken to Ambedkar hospital and was declared dead on arrival. His postmortem was conducted at the AIIMS and the body handed over to his family on Sunday afternoon. The walls of the flat were riddled with bullets: Fajja fired eight rounds and the cops replied with 12. Dahiya didn’t fire at police and surrendered unhurt the moment the policemen barged in. A pistol was found on him. On March 25, amidst the shootout on the premises of Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, Delhi Armed Police personnel had shot dead a criminal and injured another after they tried to free Fajja from their custody on Thursday noon. Fajja had been brought to the GTB Hospital for a checkup. Soon after the incident, police officers sealed all border points and alerted patrol to keep watch on suspicious elements. Dozens of raids were conducted at possible hideouts, and criminals outside and inside jails were interrogated for clues. Finally, the breakthrough came on Saturday night. “Fajja was previously involved in 11 criminal cases, including five brutal murders and three cases of armed robberies, extortion and other cases,” DCP Kushwaha said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/gangster-who-fled-from-hospital-shot-dead-in-delhi/articleshow/81741137.cms||Raj Shekhar
---||Goa||After restoring casket, ASI wants dust filters at Basilica||PANAJI: After completing the restoration of the 400-year-old Mastrillian casket of St Francis Xavier, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has now proposed the installation of dust filters at the Basilica of Bom Jesus. “We had a lot of discussions, and are trying to put dust filters around the casket so that dust doesn’t deposit on its surface. These are simple machines which will filter the dust. We have been using them at the Ajanta caves for more than a decade now,” said ASI’s deputy superintending archaeological chemist, western zone, Aurangabad, Shrikant Misra. ASI will have to work out the number of dust filters required. “This will be calculated according to the volume of the area we want to keep dust-free. Each of the important caves at Ajanta have an average of four dust filters. Dust filters are not installed in all the caves, but only in those which have paintings,” he said. The dust filters will work like vacuum cleaners, sucking out the dust and circulating pure air in the area. “Once dust deposits on the surface of the casket, it is difficult to remove it. If dust gets attached to the silver or cloth portions of the casket, we cannot use any solution to clean it because any solvent will destroy the cloth,” he said. TOI had reported that the casket which contains the relics of St Francis Xavier in a sealed metallic box comprises a wooden structure covered with a velvet cloth, which is fitted over with silver plates. The 400 kg casket is also very heavy to be brought down from the mausoleum periodically for cleaning. “It’s very heavy and very delicate. We cannot take the risk, and it’s better not to disturb it. Any dusting has to be done on the top itself,” he said. The filters are expected if the proposal is approved and funds sanctioned during the next financial year. Soft brushes are used to clean paintings and sculptures and vacuum cleaners for the dust on the ground, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-restoring-casket-asi-wants-dust-filters-at-basilica/articleshow/81740735.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||India||Keep minimum age of 21 for availing ART: House panel||NEW DELHI: The parliamentary standing committee on health and family welfare in its report on the Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Bill 2020 recommended a uniform minimum age criteria of above 21 years for both women and men for availing ART services. It recommended that minimum age for a woman who wants to avail of the services of an ART clinic or bank should be "above 21" and not "above the legal age of marriage" (which is 18 years) as used in the definition of a "eligible woman" in the bill. The committee said the specific age of 21 years be used in place of "legal age of marriage" in the clause where it is stated that "the clinics shall apply the ART services to women and men above the legal age of marriage and below the age of 50 years and 55 years for women and men respectively." The reasoning to settle for 21 years for a woman is also cited to ensure their safety. The report records that one stakeholder has informed the committee that the complications of IVF (Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, OHSS) are higher in younger woman. After it was introduced in Lok Sabha, the ART Bill 2020 was referred in October last year to the standing committee on health and family welfare for examination. The committee chaired by Ram Gopal Yadav tabled its report in Parliament in the budget session that concluded last week. The bill provides for the regulation and supervision of the assisted reproductive technology clinics and the assisted reproductive technology banks, prevention of misuse, safe and ethical practice of assisted reproductive technology services. The department of health research, in its response to the committee while giving clarification on whether bill allows single unmarried women to avail the service of ART, submitted that single woman as divorced, widowed and unmarried are allowed to avail ART services. "The bill allows single unmarried woman to avail ART services keeping in view that adoption is allowed for single woman," it explained. Meanwhile, the bill as of now defines a "commissioning couple" as an infertile married couple approaching an ART clinic or bank.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); While deliberating over the issue of whether same sex couple and those in live-in relationships should be given reproductive rights under the ART Bill, the committee observed that "even though the Supreme Court has decriminalised same sex relationship, it did not introduce any special provisions or grant any additional rights to same sex couples." The Committee also observes that “given Indian family structure and social milieu and norms, it will not be very easy to accept a child whose parents are together but not legally married. The Committee feels that keeping the best interest of that child born through ART services and other parentage issues in case of their separation, it would not be appropriate to allow live-in couples and same sex couples to avail the facility of ART”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/keep-minimum-age-of-21-for-availing-art-house-panel/articleshow/81741134.cms||Ambika Pandit
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Decision on school exams likely today||BENGALURU: With Covid-19 cases increasing by the day, a meeting chaired by chief minister BS Yediyurappa on Monday with ministers and officials will discuss all possible measures, including whether to hold final exams for classes 1 to 9. Health minister K Sudhakar said: “How does it matter as a decision has been made to pass all students between classes 1 and 9. We’ll discuss this too in the meeting.” However, the government has not communicated any decision about exams to schools as yet. Education Minister Suresh Kumar said: “I’ve received a message to attend the CM’s meeting at 5 pm Monday. The point of keeping schools open and exams is likely to come up at the meeting. It has been only two months since classes 6 and 7 reopened. Let’s see how we can balance children’s health and education. I have visited over 500 schools and am impressed by the discipline children are maintaining. They are better than adults.” However, infections have been rising in schools and colleges across the state. A medical student whose college in Dakshina Kannada district reported positive cases said: “It’s the responsibility of students to be extra cautious. At times my classmates do not follow Covidappropriate behaviour.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-decision-on-school-exams-likely-today/articleshow/81743216.cms||---
---||Mangaluru||Many campuses in Karnataka turn into infection zones||MANGALURU: Schools and colleges across the state are fuelling the surge in Covid-19 cases with clusters breaking out on campuses, leading to many of them being declared containment zones. As a result, many parents wantt the government to scrap on-campus classes and resume online and Vidyagama lessons. On Saturday, nine students of a government hostel in KR Nagar, Mysuru, tested positive. This is after five students of a government high school on the outskirts of the city had also tested positive, while 18 students in a school in Bannur were infected, which together with contacts totalled 78 cases. Teachers say fear of infection is affecting classroom activities. “Conducting academic activities with everyone fearful is a difficult task,” a teacher said. “But there is no alternative as many government school children do not have access to online classes.” Parents, though, are adamant. “The government should close schools at least for a few days until the pandemic situation eases,” said Sahana Anant, a resident of Siddarthanagar. However, Panduranga, DDPI said, “Barring a few, schools are largely Covid-19 free. If they follow all the safety guidelines strictly, they can keep campuses infection-free.” 10 containment zonesDakshina Kannada, which has pupils coming from across the Kerala border, is even more badly hit. At least 10 institutions have been declared containment zones, while in neighbouring Udupi more than 800 cases were reported from Manipal Institute of Technology alone. Officials blame it on mismanagement and violations of protocols. Dr Ramachandra Bairy, DHO of DK, said although Mangalore University campus in Konaje and a private university campus in Mangaluru had reported more than five cases each, the students were in different departments/ blocks and hence the campuses were not made containment zones. Dr Bairy blamed college administrations, especially nursing colleges. “They took the spread of infection lightly,” he said. “Medical/nursing colleges have a ‘know-it-all’ and ‘I don’t care’ attitude as they are in the healthcare industry. Nursing colleges have the highest number of students from Kerala and they allowed these students on campus without RT-PCR negative certificates.” Increasing casesNitesh Patil, Dharwad deputy commissioner, on Sunday said the health department is conducting Covid-19 testing in colleges after 13 positive cases were reported in Vidyaniketan PU College in Hubballi, five in JG College of Commerce College, two in BVB Engineering College and two in Mahesh PU College, Dharwad. Besides these, SDM College of Engineering and Technology in Dharwad has recorded 18 cases. Patil too blamed managements, saying SOPs are ignored even after repeated appeals. He warned legal action would be taken if rules continued to be broken.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/many-campuses-in-karnataka-turn-into-infection-zones/articleshow/81741154.cms||GURURAJ JAMKHANDI

According to sources in the Central security establishment, 43 incidents of terrorist violence have been recorded in J&K so far this year, down from 58 in the corresponding period of 2020. One civilian was killed against 6 in the corresponding period of last year. At least nine local youths reported as ‘missing’ and believed to have joined terror outfits, have returned home this year. Of the 20 J&K youths who got recruited by terror outfits so far in 2021, at least 8 were either killed in encounters or arrested. An appeal was made to each terrorist trapped in the encounter, through his family members, to surrender. In fact, 15 terrorists were motivated by the security forces to surrender at various encounter sites in the past one year. Efforts are on to get other terror recruits to return to the mainstream by getting their families to make similar appeals. While making sure that the identity of these “returnees” is not revealed, the J&K police is known to tactfully work upon their deradicalization by offering them counselling sessions, besides encouraging them to share their grievances, needs and interests so that these can be resolved by offering them skill development opportunities, jobs and even loans for a business start-up. “Due to a number of measures taken by law enforcement agencies, the number of youths getting radicalised has dropped. In fact, the number of Kashmiris joining terrorism has also decreased as compared to 2018,” J&K DGP Dilbag Singh said adding that 201 persons in J&K took up terrorism in 2018, 140 in 2019 and 167 in 2020. The Kashmiri youths have traditionally been radicalised by members of the local clergy propagating jihadi ideology, though other factors like peer pressure, perceived notions of injustice and construing state action against anti-national elements as oppression, also contributed to the radicalised mindset. Sources told TOI that while radicalisation perpetrated by the local clergy has reduced substantially due to effective surveillance and legal recourse by the government, propaganda on social media is still fuelling radicalisation. “However, the radicalising forces, including social media handles operated mostly by ISPR of Pakistan, now have lower traction among the Kashmiri youths amid efforts by the J&K police to keep them engaged under Centrally-sponsored civic action programme,” said an intelligence official.  “Youth engagement under civic action programme is an enduring means to counter radicalisation. J&K Police carry out various public outreach programs such as study tours for local students to various places in the country, round-the-year sports activities, educational support to needy students, running eight drug de-addiction centres across the UT, etc,” said the DGP. “Thousands of youth benefit from this and stay closely connected to us. We have been able to strengthen public trust in police and the security forces through our genuine activities,” he added. Meanwhile, a counter-narrative is being built against anti-government propaganda used to entrap J&K youth by playing upon their feeling of alienation and grievances. Some 3-4 Whatsapp groups are now sharing details of works done by the government and fix accountability where the local administration fails to deliver, said a source. J&K police sources said no empirical data was available to be precise about the number of youths who have got deradicalised due to their efforts. “However, scores of potential recruits were identified and subsequently counselled to desist from violence after taking families and community members on board,” Singh told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/terror-acts-in-jk-youths-joining-outfits-have-dipped/articleshow/81741170.cms||Bharti Jain

While the chief minister, campaigning at Thiruvottriyur in the city, turned emotional and cautioned people on the safety of women if DMK were to return to power, AIADMK workers staged protests at several places across the state. “I did not want to bring it up. But seeing so many womenfolk in the crowd, I am addressing it,” the chief minister said, while trying to control his tears. “If they can make such crass statements about my mother, despite me being the chief minister, then think of the safety of ordinary women in DMK rule, if they come to power,” Palaniswami said, urging the people to give appropriate verdict. Raja has been booked under sections 153 (provocation with intent to cause riot) and 294b (foul language in a public place) of the IPC and under section Section 127 (Disturbances at election meetings) of the Representation of the People Act. The case has been registered based on a complaint by AIADMK advocate wing joint secretary Thirumaran. CCB books Raja for derogatory remarks against EPSThe Central Crime Branch (CCB) of the Chennai police have registered a case against DMK MP A Raja for the remarks he made in poor taste against chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami. The DMK leader has been booked under sections 153 (provocation with intent to cause riot) and 294b (foul language in a public place) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and under section 127 (Disturbances at election meetings) of the Representation of the People Act. The action is based on a complaint by AIADMK advocate wing joint secretary Thirumaran. The Ariyalur police too registered cases in Meensurutti and Kizhapaluvur police stations against Raja. While speaking at an election campaign on Friday, A Raja, had made some derogatory remarks against Palaniswami, triggering protests by AIADMK and BJP workers across the state. The AIADMK urged the EC to debar Raja from campaigning for the ensuing election. On Saturday, Raja claimed that his remarks were misinterpreted and that he had made the remarks in a political context and not with reference to EPS’s personal life. DMK president M K Stalin also appealed to his party members to keep campaigns and speeches dignified. Protests by AIADMK and BJP cadres continued on Sunday. In Coimbatore, hundreds of AIADMK and BJP women’s wing workers beat photographs of the MP using footwear and also burned his photographs. They also condemned the DMK for making anti-women statements. Addressing the party workers, Coimbatore South assembly constituency candidate from the BJP Vanathi Srinivasan said Raja must apologise for the remark. “The DMK leader’s family is involved in corruption but they sent a woman (Kanimozhi MP) to jail. They don’t know how to treat women. But the AIADMK and the BJP respect and worship women,” she added. It was only a few days ago that DMK propaganda secretary Dindigul I Leoni made sexist remarks and body-shamed women at a campaign in Coimbatore. In Salem, AIADMK’s advocates wing led by treasurer Kalaiarasi handed over a petition to the Salem city commissioner seeking stern action against Raja. Tension prevailed for a while in the city after a few AIADMK cadres attempted to burn an effigy of Raja.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/comment-on-mom-cm-edappadi-k-palaniswami-turns-emotional-police-book-a-raja/articleshow/81741224.cms||D Govardan

Dredgers working to dislodge the stranded vessel have so far shifted 27,000 cubic metres of sand, to a depth of 18 metres, and efforts would continue around the clock according to wind conditions and tides, the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) said. Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has ordered preparations for the possible removal of some of the ship's 18,300 containers, SCA chairman Osama Rabie told Egypt's Extra News. Any operation to lighten the ship's load would not start before Monday, an SCA source said. The 400-metre long Ever Given became jammed diagonally across a southern section of the canal in high winds more than five days ago, halting shipping traffic in one of the world's busiest waterways. At least 369 boats are waiting to transit the canal, Rabie said, including dozens of container ships, bulk carriers, oil tankers and liquefied natural gas or liquefied petroleum gas vessels. Shippers affected by the blockage may be offered discounts, Rabie said. Rescue workers from the SCA and a team from Dutch firm Smit Salvage have been weighing whether some cargo will need to be removed by crane in order to refloat the Ever Given. Experts have warned that such a process could be complex and lengthy. Rabie said he hoped it would not be necessary, but that Egypt would take up offers of international assistance if it did switch to that strategy. "There are positive indicators," Rabie told Egyptian state TV. "The rudder was not moving and it is now moving, the propeller is working now, there was no water underneath the bow, and now there is water under it, and yesterday there was a 4-metre deviation in the bow and the stern." However, two SCA sources said that a mass of rock had been found at the bow of the ship, complicating salvage efforts. "We're dividing the day into two halves, 12 hours for dredgers and 12 hours for tugs, because not all times are suitable for tugs due to the tide," said Rabie, adding that 14 tug boats were being deployed. About 15% of world shipping traffic transits the Suez Canal, which is a key source of foreign currency revenues for Egypt. The current stoppage is costing the canal $14-15 million daily. Shipping rates for oil product tankers nearly doubled after the ship became stranded, and the blockage has disrupted global supply chains.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/tugs-dredgers-fight-to-unblock-suez-canal-ship-may-be-partially-unloaded/articleshow/81741227.cms||---

On Sunday, 2,194 people tested positive for coronavirus pushing the tally to 8,79,473. As per official data, 11 people died of the virus in the last 24 hours. The state’s net toll stands at 12,670, the second highest in the country next to Maharashtra (54,073). The number of active cases crossed the 13,000-mark after 129 days. The state’s active cases (13,070) have risen by 225% in one month. Cases have been on the rise in Chennai district since the past two weeks. The number of daily positive cases crossed the 800-mark on Sunday, with 833 new cases. In response, the state health department has increased the bed strength in government healthcare facilities and has urged civic and local bodies to arrange quarantine centres. Of the 4,800-odd Covid beds in Chennai government hospitals,1,300 (27%) have been occupied as of now. After inspecting facilities at Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH) on Sunday, health Secretary J Radhakrishnan said that 600 additional beds have been kept ready at RGGGH, which currently has 319 Covid patients undergoing treatment. After Chennai, a high incidence of cases was reported in Chengalpet (188 new cases) and Coimbatore (180) districts. These three districts together account for 1.7% of cases in India. In Thanjavur , yet another cluster was reported at a private agricultural college where 24 people tested positive. Already 20 educational institutions in the district have been penalised and booked for allowing the infection to spread. Thanjavur currently has 108 active cases. The state administration has increases testing, with 84,927 people being screened for the virus on Sunday. Though there is fatigue among doctors and officials owing to the extended pandemic, officials said the state machinery is continuing its fight against the virus with the same momentum as earlier.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-reports-2194-new-cases-833-test-positive-in-chennai/articleshow/81741238.cms||---
---||Business||Government, exporters hope USTR goes slow on retaliatory levy||NEW DELHI: The government and exporters are hoping that the US Trade Representative (USTR) goes slow on the proposed retaliatory tariff on 40 items, including basmati rice, shrimps and several gems and jewellery products, in response to India's digital service tax (DST). The US has indicated that it may not rush ahead with the move against India, although it has sought public comments. Although the extent of duty collected through a 2% levy will add up to around $55 million annually, the damage will be assessed by the USTR as part of the investigation. Experts believe it is bad optics considering that India the US are strategic allies but are yet to clinch a deal to sort out earlier action and retaliatory measures. The action came days after Catharine Tai was sworn in as the new USTR and had a virtual meeting with commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal. Last year, US had started a probe against India and several other countries for imposing DST. Exporters are cautious on their assessment. "If the US goes ahead with the move, it will have a dampening effect on Indian exports. It is discriminatory tariff, especially when Indian exporters are competing with others for the same products. But the impact will depend on the extent of the duty imposed. If it is 2-3%, exporter may be able to absorb it. But it will sure hurt them if the tariff is 15-20%," said Ajay Sahai, director general of Federation of Indian Export Organisations. Others are seeking a multilateral solution to the issues, something that is being debated at international forums such as OECD. "While retaliatory tariffs can hamper the interests of SMEs and consumers both in India and US, a possible action by India will create a rollerball effect. Tax challenges in digital economies are not just limited to India but will involve many countries soon, and hence a multilateral approach by the way of dialogues should be considered," industry lobby group Trade Promotion Council of India said. The USTR move reiterates that countries do not change their policies despite the change of leadership, said trade experts. Given the tough bargain that US is known for, it is unlikely to settle for a deal without extracting concessions in return, especially when the finance ministry, which had imposed the levy, has failed to convince India's key trading partner on the issue. For the last two years or so, India is hoping to address US concerns, ranging from price control on medical devices IPR to e-commerce and export promotion schemes, while also negotiating a deal that will see both countries open up their markets for each other for products ranging from apple to technology products.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/govt-exporters-hope-ustr-goes-slow-on-retaliatory-levy/articleshow/81741258.cms||Sidhartha

While Rahul Gandhi lambasted chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami as a “corrupt CM who has surrendered before PM Narendra Modi for fear of CBI and Enforcement Directorate”, Stalin accused the Centre of unleashing a ‘chemical’ and ‘cultural’ attack on the state. Addressing a grand public meeting in Salem on Sunday, where Rahul shared the dais with DMK president and leaders of alliance parties, the Congress leader said the old AIADMK was dead and gone and what remains now is the hollow shell controlled by the RSS and the BJP. “The AIADMK has a mask on it. It looks like AIADMK. If you remove the mask, it’s RSS and BJP,’’ he said. Calling the 2021 TN assembly election a battle between Tamil people and communal forces, he called upon the people to defeat the BJPAIADMK front to protect Tamil culture, language and identity. Stalin in his speech said: “The huge responsibility of protecting India from communal forces is with you (Rahul). Please take steps to form a formidable alliance at the national level.’’||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/m-k-stalin-asks-rahul-gandhi-to-build-national-oppn-cong-leader-predicts-dmk-victory/articleshow/81741270.cms||Mayilvaganan

More than 100 people were killed the same day in Myanmar by the military junta which seized power in a coup last month. The UN on Sunday strongly condemned the Myanmar military's "widespread, lethal, increasingly systematic attacks against peaceful protesters, as well as other serious violations of human rights since it seized power on February 1." According to media reports, only eight countries - Russia, China, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Laos, Thailand and India - attended the parade in Naypyitaw that was televised live apparently to intimidate the protesters. India's military attache in Myanmar attended the parade. India's presence at the parade comes at a time when questions are being raised about the government's silence on the military coup and violence against the protesters. India's reaction has so far been limited to expressing "deep concern" and calling for rule of law and democratic process to be upheld. It has also called upon the Myanmar leadership to work together to resolve their differences in a peace-ful manner. India drew flak from pro-democracy and anti-junta groups in Myanmar for being the only real democratic country to send a representative to the parade.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/amid-crackdown-india-7-other-countries-attend-myanmar-military-parade/articleshow/81741287.cms||---

Police said that Vanitha, along with her brother, smashed the head of her husband using an LPG cylinder. Her husband used to demand money from her to buy alcohol. The deceased, S Kabali, 38, of PNK Garden was a house painter by profession and was addicted to alcohol. On Friday, Kabali’s aunt and neighbour Muthulakshmi found him lying unconscious inside his house when she went looking for him. She alerted his brother S Subramani, 40, of Royapettah, who in turn informed the Mylapore police. Police rushed to the spot and found Kabali lying dead. A case of suspicious death was registered as he had bled from ears and nose. The body was sent for postmortem to Government Royapettah Hospital, where it was confirmed that he had died from a huge blow to the head. Kabali's wife Vanitha, who was staying at a relative's house, was picked up for interrogation. She told police on Saturday that she and her brother V Santhakumar, of Pallavaram, conspired to kill her husband before Santhakumar smashed his head with an LPG cylinder. Police said Vanitha complained that her husband treating her shabbily when she refused to give him money to buy alcohol. This led to repeated arguments between the two. Before the day of Kabali’s death, Santhakumar sent the woman to arelative’s house. He told her that he was going to use a cylinder to kill Kabali. As per their plan, Santhakumar told Kabali that he would like to join him for a drink. Soon after Kabali was drunk, Santhakumar killed him and left home around midnight. Based on Vanitha’s confession, her brother was arrested. The brother-sister duo were booked bythe Mylapore police for murder and remanded in judicial custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/woman-brother-kill-her-alcoholic-husband-held-in-chennai/articleshow/81741308.cms||---
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu power bills give inadequate info: Study||CHENNAI: Last year, amid complaints about hefty electricity bills, some residents moved the Madras high court saying Tangedco’s methodology to calculate power consumption during the Covid-triggered lockdown was arbitrary and unjust. Now, a study by Citizen Consumer and Civic Action Group (CAG) and CEEW (Council on Energy, Environment and Water) suggests that Tangedco’s white meter card for electricity bills provides inadequate information on consumption and tariffs when compared to bills in other states. There is a dire need to redesign power bills to provide detailed billing information, it says. Electricity bills are key tools for enabling consumers to interact with the utility and various stakeholders in a transparent manner, it adds. Tangedco had argued that the huge bills were due to people spending more time at home. The study, ‘Making electricity bills consumer friendly’ by Pavithra Ramesh, Prateek Aggarwal and Kanika Balani, says sharing information about consumption patterns, energy conservation and energy efficiency can help manage power demand optimally. “While consumption and tariff details in a bill enable consumers to be informed about the utility, details about energy mix, grievance redressal and energy efficiency tips create space for greater consumer engagement.” The study, which collected data from 250 respondents in nine TN districts, found that most consumers have low awareness of billing information as they primarily rely on white meter cards, which offer less information than online account summaries. While 96% of respondents knew the first 100 units were free on a bimonthly basis, one-third were unsure how the slab-wise tariffs applied after subsidy deduction and 87% of those aware about the break-up of charges had access to the online summary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-power-bills-give-inadequate-info-study/articleshow/81741319.cms||---
---||India||President gives assent to Bill that says 'government' in Delhi means 'LG'||NEW DELHI: President Ram Nath Kovind on Sunday gave his assent to the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Act, 2021, which gives more power to the lieutenant governor over the elected government. The Act now mentions that "the expression "government" referred to in any law to be made by the legislative assembly shall mean the lieutenant governor". The GNCTD (Amendment) Bill, 2021 was passed in Lok Sabha on Monday and in Rajya Sabha on Wednesday amid ruckus by the Opposition members. The central government announced the presidential assent through a gazette notification. The Bill sought to make changes in Section 33 so that the "legislative assembly shall not make any rule to enable itself or its committees to consider the matters of day-to-day administration of the capital or conduct inquiries in relation to the administrative decisions". Also, now the LG's opinion will be required before taking "any executive action in pursuance of the decision of the council of ministers or a minister, to exercise powers of the government, state government, appropriate government, lieutenant governor, administrator or chief commissioner, as the case may be, under any law in force in the capital". Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had tweeted on Wednesday: "RS passes GNCTD Amendment Bill. Sad day for Indian democracy. We will continue our struggle to restore power back to people. Whatever be the obstacles, we will continue doing good work. Work will neither stop nor slow down." On Sunday, Kejriwal thanked Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan "for supporting the people of Delhi against BJP's assault on democracy and federalism" after the latter tweeted that the Bill was "an affront to our federal principles and rights of states". Though Aam Aadmi Party had vehemently opposed the Bill, it couldn't be reached for comments on Sunday. Union Minister G Kishan Reddy had said the amendments would lead to transparency and clarity in governance in Delhi and enhance public accountability. Explaining the rationale behind the Bill, he added that the amendments had been brought to remove ambiguities in the existing Act. He stressed that changes in the law had been sought in the spirit of what was said in a Supreme Court judgment. Reddy said there was no political angle and the amendments were on "technical" grounds. "The Bill does not curtail in any manner the powers enjoyed by Delhi government that are already provided in the Constitution," he had added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/president-gives-assent-to-bill-that-says-government-in-delhi-means-lg/articleshow/81741349.cms||---

According to the data tabled in the Parliament by the MSME ministry, creation of new jobs in micro enterprises of Gujarat under the scheme have reduced from 31,864 in 2019-20 to 12,712 in 2020-21 (till December 31, 2020). Industry players said that employment was impacted due to the lockdown and therefore, fresh employment generation across sectors went down. “The major reason for decline in creation of fresh jobs in micro enterprises is the lockdown. As industries grappled with decline in demand, while struggling to maintain revenue inflows, the goal was to salvage jobs of existing workforce. Therefore, fresh employment generation is bound to get impacted,” said Chintan Thaker, chairman, Assocham, Gujarat State Council. Gujarat employs at least 1 crore persons in the MSME sector, according to data by the industries and mines department of the state government. In fact, disbursals in the microfinance portfolio also remained almost flat in the December quarter in Gujarat, according to the latest quarterly report on microfinance lending by CRIF. However, officials of Khadi Village and Industries Commission (KVIC), which is the implementing agency for PMEGP suggest that applications have continued to pour in and by March-end, there will be recovery. Sanjay Hedaoo, state director, Gujarat, KVIC, said, “The inflow of fresh applications is good and we have already reached the level of an approximate 18,000 applications for PMEGP by February2021. In March, we target reaching good numbers. The reduction could be due to slower processing at the level of banks initially.” Industry sources said that registrations for selfemployment under PMEGP declined in the pandemic year also because of the migration of several workers to their home states. However, there has been recovery in the market and in the last quarter, the numbers are expected to go up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/new-jobs-in-micro-enterprises-under-pmegp-halve-in-gujarat/articleshow/81741356.cms||Niyati Parikh

Data with code hosting platform GitHub shows that Indian programmers made the best out of their isolation - 1.8 million more developers joined the platform during the past one year and contributed way more than their global peers. GitHub said on Friday that India is the fastest growing country in the world in terms of new developers contributing to open source. The number of contributions increased by 75% in India, against 40% in the rest of the world last year. The overall India developer community on GitHub is 5.8 million-strong. "We predict that by February 2023, we will have over 10 million developers in India writing code and building important software for the world on Github," said Erica Brescia, the company's chief operating officer. In a first for India, GitHub announced a Rs 1 crore grant for open source projects from the country that need support. Though most of the world runs on open source code, globally, there has been little or no incentive for the maintainers and developers who are a part of these projects as hobbyists or volunteers. "There's a new trend in India where students and startups are creating more open source projects and giving it to the community. The grant intends to give them the support that they need in continuing to build on these projects," said Maneesh Sharma, country manager, GitHub India. Applications are open and a jury of three has been drafted in to identify the projects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/india-fastest-growing-open-source-contributor-github/articleshow/81741376.cms||Habeeba Salim

Govind claims he surrendered, and released two videos on social media early morning, saying he was going to give himself up. An hour after these videos went viral, the Madhya Pradesh special task force (STF) nabbed him. “He was arrested by our team from the bus stand around 6.30am. He has been handed over to Damoh police for further investigation,” STF chief Vipin Maheshweri, who was leading the operation to nab Govind, told TOI. A local court remanded him in jail. Police are now looking for those who sheltered him from the law. In one of the videos, Govind says he was surrendering because of an appeal made by his MLA wife, and ‘through an MLA’. He claims he has nothing to do with the murder. “It’s a political conspiracy. I may be hanged in public if found guilty,” Govind says in the videos, which were apparently shot at the residence of a political leader. On March 12, SC had hauled up Madhya Pradesh Police for failing to nab Govind in the murder of a Congress worker in 2019, and ordered his arrest. Police HQ tasked STF chief Vipin Maheshweri with the arrest and raised the bounty on Govind to Rs 50,000. Police raided several villages in Damoh district and arrested his brother and a nephew but couldn’t find the accused. On Friday, the DGP filed an affidavit in SC that police hadn’t been able to arrest Govind. After going through the affidavit, the court said: “An effort is being made to shield the accused from the law.” “We find the affidavit of the DGP completely unacceptable. It defies reason as to how an accused who is the spouse of a sitting MLA has not been arrested despite being arraigned in pursuance of the provisions of Section 319 of CrPC to face trial for an offence under Section 302 of IPC,” a bench led by Justice DY Chandrachud said. Accused handed over to Damoh policeThe Supreme Court warned DGP to arrest him or face action. “We issue a direction to the DGP to take necessary steps to ensure that the previous order of this court is complied with before the next date of listing, failing which the court will be constrained to take coercive steps in accordance with law,” it said. The DGP has been asked to submit an affidavit stating the date and cause on which security was granted to the accused, whether security continues to be provided and if not, when it was withdrawn. The next hearing is on April 5.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/two-days-after-rap-by-sc-mp-cops-arrest-bsp-mla-rambais-husband-in-murder-case/articleshow/81741379.cms||P Naveen

As a precursor to the meeting, the CM discussed the Covid-19 situation in the state with home minister Basavaraj Bommai on Sunday. Besides, officials from BBMP and urban development department held a video conference on possible steps to check the spread of the virus.

The active case load has crossed the 5,000-mark to reach 5,394 due to the sudden spurt in the numbers in the last three weeks. Chittoor alone has 1,039 active cases. At one point in February, the active cases of Andhra Pradesh were in the 500 range. Guntur reported 225 new infections, followed by Chittoor (184), Visakhapatnam (167), and Krishna (135).

This is the second time in two days that a cop was manhandled for enforcing Covid restrictions. According to the complaint filed by ASI Hemant Kumar, he was deployed at P&T Square on Saturday night when six men came on board three high-end SUVs and a car, parked before a liquor store and began creating a ruckus, at 10.30pm, said Kamla Nagar SHO Vijay Sisodia. When the ASI ordered them to leave, they turned aggressive and started arguing with him and two other policemen. When the cops stood their ground, the youths got out of their vehicles and began attacking them. The ASI called for reinforcements and a team raced to the scene. One of the accused — later identified as Deepesh — was nabbed on the spot but the others fled. SHO Sisodia named four other suspects as Vishal Rajput, Monty, Mithun Patel, Diwakar Patel. Vishal and Monty were arrested on Sunday. Deepesh handles his father’s medical store in Kamla Nagar while Vishal is the son of Ghanshyam Rajput, who was dubbed ‘land mafia’ by both the BJP and Congress governments. Monty deals in used cars and SUVs.  They have been booked for violating night curfew, rioting, assaulting a government employee and obstructing a public servant from his duty. This is second such attack on cops. On Friday night, drunk youths — sons of SAF policemen — allegedly manhandled a constable in Arera Hills when he intercepted them for violating night curfew.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/yet-again-cop-attacked-in-bhopal-by-night-curfew-violators/articleshow/81741421.cms||---

Helped by summer tailwinds, domestic breweries have not only been able to stem sliding sales but have started clawing back to pre-Covid numbers. "In the east and West Bengal in particular, the beer industry is growing upwards of 50% due to a progressive change in the duty structure that has improved price accessibility for consumers," said Kartikeya Sharma, president-India & South East Asia, AB InBev. "North and South India are expected to recover to 2019 level due to low rates of Covid infections and a favorable tax climate for beer," he said. In Uttar Pradesh, for instance, excise duties for volume-driving 500-ml strong beer cans that account for 70% of overall beer volumes have been reduced by almost a third. "A 500-ml can of a top brand will cost Rs 110 instead of Rs 130," said a UP-based liquor retailer. "The state has not proposed any fee increase for retail licence renewal. Wholesale and retail margins, too, have increased." "Quarter over quarter sales have improved and December quarter was 15-20% less than the same period last year," said a senior industry executive at one of India's largest beer companies. "States that have waived corona cess have done better." Similarly, in Rajasthan, one of India's largest beer markets, duty hikes announced for Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL), coupled with the thrust behind promoting 'Rajasthan-made liquor' (RML), are expected to push beer sales. "Delhi has lowered the age limit for procuring and consuming alcohol. UP has come up with a personal bar permit, which will enable the residents to stock more litres in their respective houses," said Rahul Kapur - partner at Grant Thornton Bharat. "Many states have now updated excise norms which is expected to boost alcohol consumption." "The cut in excise duty for beer in the liquor industry in certain parts of the country is sure to give a boost to beer consumption in the respective states," said Prabhtej Singh Bhatia, co-founder and CEO Simba Craft Beer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/beer-sales-get-boost-from-state-excise-policies/articleshow/81741490.cms||John Sarkar

A video of the incident went viral on Sunday, after which police registered a case of rape against the youth, and booked the girl’s kin for violence and harassment. According to police, the minor girl and youth, a resident of Udaigarh, had come in contact with each other while working in Gujarat a few months ago.

---||Gurgaon||Portion of flyover being built on Dwarka e-way collapses, 3 injured||GURUGRAM: Gurugram: An 80-metre portion of an under-construction elevated road of the Dwarka Expressway collapsed on Sunday morning, injuring three persons who were working on an adjacent pier and came down with the concrete slabs. The effect of the collapse could have been much deadlier had it not been for Holi. Sources said about 100 workers are present at the site usually, but most had gone home for the festival. It was around 7.40am that the concrete slab came crashing down between pillars 107 and 109 near Daultabad. The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) said it had suspended two officials — one each of the contractor and the consultant — in connection with the collapse. The accident comes a little more than a month after a girder being lifted with chains came off the hook and crashed on to the ground at another construction site of the same expressway project on Pataudi Road. A video of the February 12 collapse had come to the fore two weeks ago. On Sunday morning, senior officers of the police, state disaster response force and civil defence teams rushed to the accident site and cordoned off a portion of the area. A team of the National Disaster Response Force also reached the spot and looked for any worker who might have been trapped under the debris. No casualties were reported.  Sources said technical flaws at the site had come to the fore a few days ago. Last week, two girders had been placed between pillars 107 and 109. During examination, officials were learnt to have found a crack on one of the girders. “We decided to change the girder and work had started on it last Thursday. On Saturday night, an engineer found some mechanical issue and ordered the work to be stopped. Work had been suspended in the morning too when the girder collapsed,” a source said. NHAI said it would constitute a technical committee to ascertain what could have caused the collapse. Preliminary reports, sources said, suggested that pillar number 108 was damaged and could not withstand the weight. “The cause of the accident would be investigated. Prima facie, it seems to be the result of a technical fault. A technical committee will probe the accident and samples will be sent to the Central Road Research Institute to check the quality of materials being used,” said Nirman Jambulkar, the NHAI project director. Officials of Larsen & Toubro, which has been handed the project, ruled out any lapses on the company’s part. “Engineers of the company are trying to determine the cause of the collapse. Mechanical issues such as these can occur while carrying out such heavy construction work. That’s why we ensure safety measures are well in place. We’ll submit the details of the accident to NHAI soon,” said an L&T official. Work on the Dwarka Expressway project has picked up pace over the past few weeks. During a recent inspection, Union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari had announced that the entire expressway, stuck for long, would be completed by August next year. Residents of highrises that form the backdrop of the expressway project were jolted out of sleep by the deafening sound of the girder crashing down. Some even mistook it for an earthquake. As people stepped out of their homes, they saw a thick cloud of smoke had engulfed the area. “I, for certain, felt tremors. I rushed out and saw that a portion of the flyover had collapsed,” said Devi Ram, a resident of Rajendra Park. Rajesh Mandal, who had gone out for his morning walk, said the workers who came down with the girder were not wearing safety cables. “Otherwise, they would be hanging in the air. I found two workers had suffered injuries to their hand, while a third one was nursing a wound in the leg. They were too shocked,” he added. DCP (west) Deepak Saharan said, “The collapse did not affect traffic as we had cordoned off the area. SDRF and civil defence teams were on the spot,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/portion-of-flyover-being-built-on-dwarka-e-way-collapses-3-injured/articleshow/81740325.cms||---
---||Noida||On the frontlines, fear of Covid kept him away from his baby for months||Noida: From sealing the first society where a Covid case was reported, to sending thousands of migrant workers home and having a baby in the middle of a pandemic – almost every day in the past one year brought in new challenges for Rajeev Rai. “I will not forget this in my life. I had no working hours. I would be out in the field all day, come home for dinner, leave again and be out till about 3 am. I have never had an office assignment this taxing,” says Rai, the then sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) of Dadri. He had a daughter on April 6. But since Rai was in the frontline, he could not go near the child for almost six months. At home, his wife was recovering and needed help. “Things were very difficult for her. Because of the lockdown, we did not have any house help. She had to manage the house, cook and take care of our children all by herself,” Rai says. The couple has another daughter who is nine now. “I was helpless. I could not go near my wife and children or even have a meal sitting on the same table. But soon, our elder daughter stepped in. She took care of the baby and helped her mother in whatever way she could,” adds Rai. Things were challenging outside as well. With cases rising and thousands of migrant labourers heading home, the SDM had to organise and distribute food almost daily. He was deputed at Dadri station when lakhs of labourers were taking trains to leave the city. Although during this entire period, Rai stayed in his own house, he used a guest room with a separate entrance and washroom and hardly saw his family. “I would come home, take a bath and keep my clothes aside so that they could be washed. I used disposable cutlery for months. I had to be careful because of the baby,” he says. But despite that, Rai tested positive in September. “It is strange that I did not get the virus when I was among people, distributing meals and working at the railway station. I got it when I met a relative briefly. He was sitting across a table. Later, he tested positive,” Rai recalls. His symptoms were mild but recovery took some time. “It sounds funny but Covid was a blessing in disguise. I was at home but nobody else got infected since we already had a strict protocol in place. When I finally got the report that said ‘negative’, I held my child for the first time. I spent as much time as I could with my children while recovering,” says Rai. Once he resumed work, he was transferred to the collectorate in Jewar, where Rai is still posted. He took the vaccine recently but the protocol at home is still in place. Rai still uses the guest washroom to clean up before meeting his family. “I am glad we were careful. I hope everyone stays as careful as we are. It is the only reason that I could protect my family, although I was in the frontline and had Covid myself.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/on-the-frontlines-fear-of-covid-kept-him-away-from-his-baby-for-months/articleshow/81740738.cms||Snehil Sinha

The ritual was also aimed at increasing the number of agitators that had come down lately as many farmers returned to their villages for the harvesting season. “Holika Dahan symbolises victory of good over evil. It is a ritualaround Holi in which people burn the evil and welcome the harvest season. We burnt copies of the farm laws and we hope for our victory,” said Santokh Singh of Samyukta Kisan Morcha. In Gurgaon, several farmers, casual labourers and government employees gathered outside the Sarva Haryana Gramin Bank at Jharsa village around 6.30 pm on Sunday to perform the ritual. At Shahjahanpur border, protesters performed the ritual around 7 pm. “We organised Holika Dahan to strengthen our resolve. People pledged in front of the pyre that they will not leave till our demands are fulfilled, even if that means staying put here till next year’s Holi,” said a member of Jai Kisan Andolan, Manjit Thakral. In Jind, khaps asked local villagers to assemble at Khatkar toll plaza. “Instead of organising the ritual in different villages, we decided to have a common event. We asked villagers to come to the protest site for at least 30 minutes and take part in the ritual. This is to send out a message that our protest is far from being over. It is only getting stronger. All our festivals will be celebrated in a way that we keep our protest alive through those,” said Virendra Singh Sindhu, a member of Satrol khap. On the Haryana-Rajasthan border near Punhana, farmers burnt copies of the farm laws but not as part of Holika Dahan. “The protesters here are not too familiar with the rituals. But they showed their support by burning copies of the bill,” said Ramzan Chaudhary, a local farmer leader.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/holika-dahan-protesters-burn-copies-of-farm-laws/articleshow/81740113.cms||Siddharth Tiwari

The police had registered a case under various sections, including attempt to murder charges, against more than 300 persons, including BKU Ekta Sidhupur’s Muktsar district-level functionaries, on Saturday night on the complaint of Muktsar SP (Headquarters) Gurmail Singh, who also sustained injuries in the attack on the Abohar MLA. Muktsar SSP D Sudarvizhi said with the help of video footage and other means, police have arrested four persons identified as Surjit Singh, Nem Pal Singh and Baldev Singh of Bodhiwala village and Gurmeet Singh from Khunan Kalan village. Guv asks for action taken report from Capt govtThe SSP said the police is conducting raids and the other accused persons involved in the attack will be arrested soon. Muktsar SP (investigations) Rajpal Singh had earlier told TOI the cops have collected a lot of video clips and are examining them. The attack, that was strongly criticised by all the political parties in Punjab, was also condemned by the state’s governor VP Singh Badnore on Sunday and he has asked for the action taken report from the Amarinder government. After a Punjab BJP delegation, which included state BJP president Ashwani Sharma and Union minister Som Prakash, met the governor on Sunday, Badnore called up chief minister Amarinder Singh, who is also the state home minister, to convey his serious concern. The governor said the state government authorities cannot allow such blatantly unlawful and violent attacks on anybody and added that these kinds of incidents should not be repeated and asked for strong action to be taken immediately. Protesting the humiliation of the Abohar MLA in Malout, Punjab BJP leaders also staged a sit-in outside the chief minister Captain Amarinder’s Singh’s official residence in Chandigarh on Sunday. The attack on the BJP MLA has also put the farm union leaders are under immense pressure and are facing criticism over the violent attack on the BJP MLA. BKU Ekta Sidhupur president Jagjit Singh Dallewal, whose activists were part of the protest, told TOI: “I came back from Delhi two days ago and today visited the area to get first-hand information about the incident. We feel that the incident should have been avoided at all levels, but it is mounting anger which the central government must keep in mind. We surely feel that such incidents cause a loss to the struggle. I will ask activists to keep restraint but sometimes the situation arise that the schooling of thought goes behind and anger comes to fore.” Even Darshan Pal, the leftist ideologue, was clear that violence against BJP leaders would serve no purpose. “We feel this incident was highly unwanted. Time and again, we have asked activists to limit their opposition to spoken words. Getting physical with them will not serve our purpose but anger is rising by the day against the central government but we will never justify such an act. We will introspect about it in the Sanyukta Kisan Morcha meeting on March 30,” Darshan Pal told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/punjab-police-arrest-4-identify-23-out-of-300-named-in-fir/articleshow/81741566.cms||---

---||Gurgaon||Gurugram: Months after DTCP order, no boundary wall yet for society||GURUGRAM: Residents of BPTP Park Serene in Sector 37 D have alleged non-compliance of department of town and country planning (DTCP) directions by the developer of the society. The residents complained that even after three months, the developer has failed to complete the construction of the boundary wall alongside the revenue road which is posing a serious security risk. In December last year, the enforcement wing of the DTCP had cleared the encroachment done by the developer on the revenue road. “After several complaints, the department cleared the encroachment but now it has become a security concern for us as the builder is not closing the open passage. Though there is a guard assigned at the gate but it is not a practical solution as anybody can enter the premises. The builder has not strictly complied with the sanctioned layout plan and has done severe violation,” said PK Naithani, president of Park Serene RWA. Earlier this month, the residents had written to deputy commissioner of Gurugram and the authorities concerned on the matter and demanded the construction of missing portion of boundary wall alongside the road in a time bound manner to avoid any security risk for the residents living in the society. The residents pointed out that the developer has installed a double gate on both sides of the revenue road and is claiming that it is a fire tender path. “This is a clear violation of Haryana Building Code, 2017 and National Building Code 2016 as the fire tender path is useless in case of a mishap. How can an internal fire tender path be crossing a public revenue road? How did the fire department and DTCP provide NOC for Occupation Certificate with such huge violations?” questioned Hemant Kumar, RWA general secretary. Meanwhile, a representative of the developer said, “With due compliance, the work has already been undertaken considerably while back and if there are any complaints with the department we will respond to them. The wall has been constructed according to the directions by the department and gates have been installed with guards.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/months-after-dtcp-order-no-boundary-wall-yet-for-society/articleshow/81740129.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

It marks the arrival of the spring harvest season in the country. People celebrate the festival by binging on some lip-smacking sweets, thandai and splash coloured powder, water, and balloons while chanting "Holi Hai". The evening before Holi is known as Holika Dahan or Chhoti Holi during which people light a bonfire to signify the burning of the demon Holika.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-vice-president-kamala-harris-extends-greeting-on-holi/articleshow/81741575.cms||---
---||India||Why one sanitation worker continues to die every five days in Swachh India||In February, 37-year-old Narayana, a municipal sweeper in Karnataka, died by suicide. He had been forced to clean a manhole with his bare hands, and to add to this indignity, civic officials in Maddur pressured him to tell the inquiry committee that he did it voluntarily. It was this reported harassment by officials — who had docked his salary and placed him under suspension — that drove him to breaking point. Like Narayana, manual scavengers continue to die with sickening regularity across the country. On March 26, two workers died while cleaning a septic tank in an East Delhi banquet hall. In February, four sanitation workers asphyxiated to death while desilting a sewer line in Kolkata’s Kudghat, while three men died cleaning a septic tank near Chennai on February 14. Between 2016 and 2019, the government has recorded 282 deaths but activists say that the actual numbers are far higher. On an average, one sanitation worker dies every 5 days according to research by NGO Rehabilitation Research Initiative (RRI) based on fieldwork and interviews with the manual scavenging community. CONVICTION RATE IS LOW But beside the occasional news report, why isn’t anything done although there has been unprecedented priority given to sanitation under the Swachh Bharat Mission since 2014? By 2019, the government had already spent over Rs 57,000 crore to build nine crore toilets. Researcher and activist Sheeva Dubey, who has been studying the condition of sanitation workers in Mumbai since 2015, says money has been spent on infrastructure but not on people who are involved in the process of cleaning. “In most cases, the work to clean a clogged drain or septic tank is contracted privately by a housing society or a company. There is no provision for safety equipment or emergency assistance. Often if there is a death the first responders, usually the police, do not even bother to register a case and write it off as an accident,” she says. Centre for Policy Research fellow Arkaja Singh, who has been working on the issue of sanitation labour and rights of manual scavengers, recalls a case when three sewerage workers died in April 2017 in Delhi’s Lajpat Nagar. Though the sewerage line belonged to the Delhi Jal Board, it distanced itself saying that the workers had not been contracted either by the DJB or its contractor. “There was no liability proved for anyone except for the workers who died,” she says. Ironically while India was under lockdown, sanitation workers were expected to continue working whether it was to dispose of hazardous waste like masks, PPEs of patients or cleaning drains and pipelines in housing societies. SLOW ADOPTION OF BOTS People continue to do this hazardous work despite technological advancements. In 2018, Kerala-based startup Genrobotics developed a robot to clean septic tanks and manholes. Priced at Rs 40 lakh, the robot can be customised to fit each city’s manholes and unclog 10 a day without any human intervention. “The technology is cost-effective,” says co-founder Rashid K, “and one robot is able to clean 200 manholes in a month.” So far the company has collaborated with municipalities in 14 states and provided over 65 robots to cities like Indore, Gurgaon, Coimbatore and Mumbai. But progress has been slow. Lack of political will and corruption in outsourcing large sanitation contracts act as impediments. The lack of a well-laid sewerage system compounds the problem — in many places in the city, it is not unusual to find sewage, storm water drains and open drains interacting with each other so that waste includes not just fecal matter but stones, debris, plastic and silt that require human intervention. There are also urban poor spaces that are not serviced by public authorities. COMPENSATION DELAYS In 2014 the Supreme Court laid down a principle of providing Rs 10 lakh as compensation for every sewer death since 1993. However, activists say that there have been very few cases where compensation has been given. Sanjana Pawar, 25, whose husband Sachin died while cleaning a clogged pipeline in Mumbai’s Shrinagar Sakinaka, has been waiting for claims since 2017. Sachin and his friend Ajay Kunchikorve choked to death within minutes of each other. “The man who had contracted them to clean the pipeline denied it. We have no proof that he was the one who employed my husband,” Sanjana says. RRI founder Pragya Akhilesh, who is also part of the Safai Karmachari Bhim Dal Union, says, “Some contractual workers do get the amount of Rs 10 lakh but the process is very cumbersome as it takes so many rounds to government offices. Also, in certain cases next of kin get less than Rs 10 lakh without any explanation.” MALAYSIA SHOWS THE WAY CPR’s Singh says that apathy towards manual scavenging deaths will continue till there is institutional investment and commitment. She cites the example of Malaysia that shifted from manual cleaning to a mechanised system of cleaning sewage. Malaysia has individual septic tanks, similar to India, and has invested in creating awareness among citizens and mechanising the process of cleaning the tanks through companies that are strictly monitored. Until we take similar steps people will continue to die, she says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/why-one-sanitation-worker-continues-to-die-every-five-days-in-swachh-india/articleshow/81741585.cms||Himanshi Dhawan
---||Gurgaon||Gurugram: Food vendor accused of employing govt school students, probe ordered||GURUGRAM: A government school in Jacobpura and some parents whose children study in the institution filed a police complaint on Saturday against a local food vendor who allegedly employed a few students at his stall. The shop has been removed from the area and a police team formed to look into the allegations. According to the students, the man offered them free meals and paid Rs 20-30 per day for chopping vegetables or washing dishes at the stall. While one girl student worked at the food stall initially, she later convinced a few others to join so that they could earn something. The food stall outside Jacobpura Girls’ Senior Secondary School is popular among casual labourers in the area and offered meals for Rs 5. It had been running for a few years, according to local residents. But a few days ago, some parents complained to the school officials saying that their children were returning home at unusual times. Sometimes they would return late in the evening, on other days, they were home early. “A group of parents came to us and asked us why the school does not have a fixed schedule and that is when we realised something was wrong because the school timings had not changed. We checked our records and found that some of our girl students did not turn up for the classes although they had left their houses wearing school uniforms,” said school principal Sunil Kumar. A special committee was formed to look into the matter and the members found that some of the students were working at the food stall outside the school. When the committee members spoke to the students, they said the owner gave them free food and Rs 20-Rs 30 per day for doing menial jobs like chopping vegetables and washing dishes. “We immediately asked the vendor to shut the shop. After getting to know what happened, some parents also threatened him with police action. He shut the stall and left the area two days ago,” Kumar added. The City police station has formed a committee with women personnel and they are looking into the allegations. “We have received the complaint and formed a team to investigate the matter. The team is reaching out to the parents and the students to take their statements ,” said station house officer Krishan Kumar. Most of the parents who were approached for a comment in the case did not wish to speak.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/food-vendor-accused-of-employing-govt-school-students-probe-ordered/articleshow/81740151.cms||Siddharth Tiwari

The district health department has decided to devise a micro plan for the same after Holi. An estimated target of 40,500 vaccinations will be carried out every week as per the new order. “Following UP government’s March 23 order, we have been given a target of 1.62 lakh inoculations in April. Our micro plan will include the number of centres and session sites,” said Dr Neeraj Tyagi, district immunisation officer, in-charge of vaccinations in GB Nagar. According to Dr Tyagi, the vaccination drive in April will not require a comorbidity certificate for people aged 45-59 years. The vaccination target will be ramped up from 7,000-8,000 per day, officials said. “We will increase the daily target to 10,000 for Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays and 3,500 for Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Saturdays. This will cover the 40,500 per week target for the district,” said Dr Tyagi. On March 23, Union Minister Prakash Javadekar announced that everyone above 45 years of age will be vaccinated from April 1 and appealed to all eligible citizens to get themselves registered to get the shots. Following the announcement, the state government drew up data of 1.62 lakh recipients in GB Nagar based on the voter registration data of the district. Alert over celebrations around Holi No vaccinations were administered in Noida on Sunday. Also, the vaccine centres will be shut on Monday on account of Holi. However, the chief medical officer directed all emergency services, staff and doctors to remain on alert on both days. The district health department will continue targeted and random samplings especially with public movement expected during the festival. “All emergency services will remain active with adequate doctors and staff on duty across over 50 government medical facilities and hospitals in both rural and urban areas of the district. These include all five CHCs, 33 PHCs and 15 Urban Health Centres (UHCs) along with District Hospital, Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS), Child PGI and ESIC hospital,” said Dr Deepak Ohri, chief medical officer (GB Nagar). The CMO informed that 32 ambulances will be deployed in the district on the day of Holi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/vax-drive-for-45-plus-up-sets-1-6l-target-for-noida/articleshow/81740150.cms||Meenakshi Sinha
---||Gurgaon||For healthcare staff, it’s a Holi away from home||Gurgaon: Pushpa (43) was packing her bags with Holi gifts for her son in Sonipat when she got a call from her supervisor. Just like Diwali, her leave for Holi too had been cancelled. A rise in the number of Covid cases in the city has prompted the district authorities to cancel the leaves of most healthcare workers. From doctors to ASHA workers and nurses, all have been asked to report for work on Monday. With the increase in cases, bed occupancy in hospitals has gone up too and so has the administration’s efforts in arresting the spread of the infection. While doctors are needed to attend to patients in hospitals, ASHA workers help the authorities with contact tracing and testing. On the whole, it’s call of duty versus call from home. The past year was anyway devoid of any celebration for the frontline workers. Even if they got leaves, they did not dare visit their families during festivals fearing they might get infected too. That is why many healthcare workers in the city had applied for leaves during Holi this year. Pushpa, an ASHA worker staying in Palam Vihar on rent, was planning to visit her husband and 14-year-old son in Sonipat. “As an ASHA worker, my primary job is to mobilise and counsel Covid patients. Not only are cases rising now, the vaccination drive is going on at the same time. For that too, we have to counsel the recipients. Plus, we have our regular work of mobilising pregnant women and children for immunisation,” she added. Dr Khushboo Singh (29), a public health manager from Rohtak, was equally disheartened. “At times, I do crave for a normal life. I also want to meet my father and brother in Rohtak. Maybe I’ll get to meet them when things are a little better,” said Dr Singh, who has been working in the city for the past three years. For Dr Amandeep (26), this is the second consecutive Holi he has had to stay away from his family in Sirsa. An urban nodal officer, he has been managing the vaccination drive with others. “This is a call of duty. I couldn’t visit my home last year too as we were involved in a crucial programme to overcome the pandemic. Like other festivals, we have to be prepared for Holi too,” he said. Those associated with testing labs and polyclinics will also have to mandatorily report for work on Monday. “Collecting samples and sending them for tests is done on a daily basis. For me, Holi will be spent the same way as Diwali last year. I will be working like usual. People like us have to make do with video calls. I am more exposed to infection and since my parents are aged, I can’t go home just like that,” said Vikram Yadav, who is associated with a polyclinic in Sector 31. Yadav’s parents live in Bhiwani. Gurgaon chief medical officer Virender Yadav said he had little option but to cancel the leaves. “But I’m also on duty to motivate others. As cases are rising in the city, monitoring the situation is extremely important. We are also carrying out vaccination drives at the same time,” he added. So far, 3,132 people have succumbed to the virus in Haryana. Of them, 2% are healthcare workers. In the city, 202 frontline workers have tested positive till now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/for-healthcare-staff-its-a-holi-away-from-home/articleshow/81740192.cms||Ipsita Pati

According to the complaint filed by the Bengaluru-based firm, Gopal Kumar had used their services to rent a Hyundai Creta in July 2020. “An Initial online booking as communicated to the complainant was made for a fixed time period starting from July 3, 2020 at 9pm till 5pm on July 4, 2020 . As per the agreed rental terms, Kumar initially paid Rs 3,884 and the car was sent to him,” said the complainant in their statement to the police. However, the vehicle was not returned on the stipulated date and time and therefore the employees of Zoomcar contacted Kumar on his mobile phone, but it was allegedly switched off. The company tried reaching him on the other number given by him, but it turned out that the number belonged to someone else. “We also sent our executive at the Driving license address, where our executive met Kumar’s mother, but she said that her son had not hired any vehicle,” said the company in their complaint. The GPS fitted in the car was last active in Kakrola, Shivaji Enclave, Dwarka, Delhi. After several failed attempts, the company approached the police and submitted a complaint. An FIR was registered after preliminary investigation under sections 379(punishment for theft), 406 (punishment for criminal breach of trust ), 420 (fraud)of the IPC at Sector 56 police station. “We have registered a case and are currently investigating the matter,” said an officer from the Sector 56 police station where the case has been registered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/man-takes-car-rental-company-for-a-ride/articleshow/81740195.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: 29 road fatalities in 82 days, most from 3pm-9pm||CHANDIGARH: Road fatalities have almost doubled from January to March 24 as compared to the same period last year, with 50% of the deaths taking place between 3pm and 9pm this year. A total of 29 people, including six women, lost their lives till March 24. Only 15 people were killed in the same period in 2020, according to police data. As many as 46 people were injured in 27 nonfatal accidents in different parts this year. What was alarming was that eight pedestrians and seven cyclists were among the victims. Ten two-wheelers riders, the highest, were also in the casualty list. Data showed that only two car occupants died, and a rehri puller and an autorickshaw occupant too were among the victims. The data revealed that the maximum of 15 people died between 3pm and 9pm. Four people were killed between 9pm and 12 midnight, three between 12 midnight and 3am and only one person between 3am and 6am. Three fatal accidents were also reported between 9am and 12 midnight. One person was killed between 12pm and 3pm. The maximum of nine casualties, including four women, were in the age group of 45 to 60. Six people each were in the 25 to 35 years and 35 to 45 years’ category list of victims. Four victims were seniors and one a minor. Traffic police said overspeeding was the major reason behind most of the accidents. S P S Sondhi, DSP, traffic, said police have been putting up overspeeding nakas at different timings and locations, issuing challans to hundreds of violators daily. Awareness camps for cyclists and rehri and rickshaw-pullers on using cycle tracks were organised, he added. The police are also planning to levy penalties on cyclists and rehri-rickshaw pullers if they do not use cycle tracks. The action was proposed in the meeting of the standing committee of the Administrator’s Advisory Council held at police headquarters in Sector 9 on March 24. In 2020 , the police had recommended cancellation of 6,510 licences of drivers caught driving above the permissible speed limit in the city. Police had also issued a total of 30,700 challans for overspeeding in 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/chandigarh-29-road-fatalities-in-82-days-most-from-3pm-9pm/articleshow/81741655.cms||Pawan Tiwari
---||World||Dozens killed in Mozambique Islamist attack: Government||MAPUTO: Dozens of people were killed in coordinated jihadist attacks in northern Mozambique's Palma town, the government said on Sunday, four days after the raid was launched and forced the evacuation of thousands of survivors to safety in the provincial capital Pemba. Seven people were killed in an ambush during an operation to evacuate them from a hotel where they had sought refuge, it said. "Last Wednesday, a group of terrorists sneaked into... Palma and launched actions that resulted in the cowardly murder of dozens of defenceless people," defence ministry spokesman Omar Saranga told a news conference. Foreigners were among those caught in the violence, but the government did not say how many foreign nationals were killed. So far one South African is known to have died during the attack, his family confirmed to AFP. Adrian Nel had been holed up in the Amarula hotel with his father and brother for two days, his mother said. As they were making their way to a convoy of cars that had come to evacuate them, Nel was shot dead, she said. His father had to carry his body until they were rescued. "There's no way to possibly describe what you feel when you get news like that," Meryl Knox told AFP. "It's just devastating, body numbing, mind numbing." Martin Ewi, a senior researcher with the Pretoria-based think-tank, the Institute for Security Studies, said that "over 100" people were still unaccounted for since the attack. "That's what we know so far," he said, but added that the situation on the ground was confusing. On Wednesday, an unknown number of militants began attacking Palma, a town of around 75,000 people in the province of Cabo Delgado that is home to a multi-billion-dollar gas project being built by France's Total and other energy companies. Human Rights Watch said the militants indiscriminately shot civilians in their homes and on the streets. In the last three days, government security forces had prioritised "the rescue of hundreds of citizens, nationals and foreigners", said Saranga, without giving a breakdown of the numbers. Some were temporarily taken to the heavily guarded gas plant located on the Afungi peninsula, on the Indian Ocean coast south of the Tanzanian border, before being moved to Pemba, around 250 kilometres (150 miles) south of Palma. A boat laden with evacuees landed in Pemba on Sunday, according to police patrolling the city port. According to a source close to the rescue operation, there were "about 1,400" people on board. Those evacuated included non-essential staff of Total and Palma residents who had sought refuge at the gas plant. Several other small boats packed with displaced people were on their way to Pemba and expected to arrive overnight or Monday morning, according to humanitarian aid agencies. Airport officials in Pemba said humanitarian aid flights had been suspended to free up space for military operations. Caritas, a Catholic aid agency which is active in the province, also reported new arrivals to Pemba. "Now we await the arrival of people who are most vulnerable so that we can provide assistance," the local head of Caritas, Manuel Nota, told AFP. The militant attack on Palma is the closest yet to the major gas project during a three-year Islamist insurgency across Mozambique's north. Since October 2017, extremist fighters have raided villages and towns in the region, forcing nearly 700,000 to flee their homes. Although they launched their campaign in 2017, experts say they had begun mobilising a decade earlier as disgruntled youths starting to practise a different type of Islam, drinking alcohol and entering mosques dressed in shorts and shoes. The violence has now taken root and claimed at least 2,600 people lives, half of them civilians, according to the US-based data-collecting agency Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (ACLED). Local media reports said British workers may have been caught up in the Palma attack, and Britain's Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said its embassy in Maputo was in "direct contact with authorities in Cabo Delgado to urgently seek further information on these reports". "The UK wholeheartedly condemns the appalling violence in Cabo Delgado. It must stop," minister for Africa James Duddridge tweeted. The United States, whose troops are helping train Mozambican forces to fight the insurgency, said Sunday it "continues to monitor the horrific situation in Palma", adding one American citizen who was in Palma had been safely evacuated. The embassy announced earlier this month that American military personnel would spend two months training soldiers in Mozambique.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/dozens-killed-in-mozambique-islamist-attack-government/articleshow/81741666.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||No Holi in groups, cops take positions to catch revellers||CHANDIGARH: The Tricity will not allow any gatherings at public places during the festival of colours on Monday. Police will deploy 900 cops to prevent hooliganism on Holi to be celebrated in a restricted manner in the backdrop of a surge in Covid-19 cases that has already led the UT administration to ban the entry of people at Sector 17 Plaza and Sukhna Lake for the day. Among the 900 cops, nine DSP and 33 inspectors will be on the roads from 9am to 6pm to prevent hooliganism and public drinking and ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour is followed. Charanjit Singh Virk, DSP, PRO, said elaborate security arrangements have been made to curb hooliganism and eve teasing. In Panchkula, deputy commissioner of police (DCP) Mohit Handa said action under Section 188 of the IPC will be taken against persons found violating Covid-19 norms. Public gatherings for Holi will not be allowed, he said. Special check posts will be set up throughout the district. The DCP appealed to residents to not go out of their homes on Holi. Those found without masks during Holi celebrations will face a fine of Rs 500. Those who do not pay the fine will be booked under Section 188 of the IPC. Special drunken driving check posts will also be set up, In Mohali too, social gatherings will not be allowed in public places on Holi. Additional deputy commissioner Aashika Jain said as the curfew is already imposed from 9pm to 5am, restrictions like gathering at public places, marriage palaces, restaurants and clubs are already in place. Jain said, “People cannot celebrate Holi in groups outside.” Doctors and the health department too suggested not to play Holi in gatherings outside immediate family. “Celebrate the festival at home. There is no need to invite people as there is a high risk. The second surge has come and to eliminate it, all residents must comply with Covid norms,” said Prof Jagat Ram, director, PGI. There are around 190 patients in the ICUs, some 300 in the emergency and 1,700 every day admissions in non-Covid area, besides 100 admissions in Covid hospital in PGI. Last year, for Diwali and New Year parties, the health department had issued advisories. “We will not advise you to play Holi. Gatherings are already banned on this day. But even if one wants to enjoy, it is better to celebrate at home,” said Dr Amandeep Kang, director health services, UT. She said, “You can never be sure about the level of exposure of your guests. They can be asymptomatic.” A public health expert said, “With the mutant strains around, the transmission is faster. It is better to avoid gatherings and stay indoors.” There is also a word of caution for the elderly and those who have comorbidites. “Even while most at this age have been vaccinated, this does not mean that one is free from the infection. There is a possibility of reducing the severity of the infection, but does not limit the transmission. Thus, keeping away from such festivities and adhering to the Covid protocols must be followed,” said a public health expert.

Sources in the BJP said the party had named the mayor, deputy mayor, standing committee chairman, and chief whip but for the committee appointments, the elected councillors were to take decisions in consultation with the party’s city unit president. There was a major dispute over the selection of Hitesh Barot as chairman of the standing committee. Several senior members refused to accept Barot as chairman. The issue reached senior party officebearers who made it clear that Barot would stay. However, sources said it is likely that the city unit will soon have new officebearers and a new president. Hence, the party is delaying the appointments. A senior BJP leader in the AMC said that there were major differences over the appointment of chairpersons of key committees which include town planning, roads and buildings, parks and gardens among others. Sources said that the party has now appointed Shah to talk to councillors and be part of the coordination committee in the AMC. Shah has been asked to talk to senior leaders and ensure there is no further embarrassment for the party which has 160 of the 192 AMC councillors, with the Congress reduced to 24. Officials said many senior leaders were promised the chairman’s post and were left out with Barot being preferred. One party office-bearer who asked not to be named said that several senior leaders had complained to Gujarat BJP president C R Paatil and chief minister Vijay Rupani. Officials said normally the appointment of the transport committee chairman takes place along with the election of the mayor, but as no consensus was reached the appointment is pending .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/bjp-fails-to-pick-amc-committee-chiefs/articleshow/81741601.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

Deaths too saw the sharpest-ever rise of 51%, with 1,875 fatalities during the week, the highest since December 21-27. With fresh cases hitting a 168-day high of 68,266 on Sunday as Maharashtra reported a record 40,414 infections, India logged over 3.9 lakh cases during the week (March 22-28), the highest since October. Last week (March 15-21) had seen a 67% surge with cases increasing by over 1 lakh as compared to the previous week. Together, the last weeks have seen the worst surge in cases since the beginning of the pandemic. The case count has tripled in the past three weeks as 1.17 lakh cases were recorded during March 1-7, less than a third of the current week’s tally of 3,93,056, as per TOI’s Covid database. India’s total Covid-19 caseload crossed 12 million (1.2 crore) on Sunday. With pandemic numbers on the rise again, the last one million cases came in 35 days, nearly half the time taken for the previous one million (65 days). Active cases of the virus also topped 5 lakh, with a record single-day rise of 35,703 on Sunday. This was the fastest ever rise of 1 lakh active cases, with the count rising from 4 lakh to 5 lakh in just three days. Deaths have been on the rise as well. The current week’s death toll of 1,875 was not just the highest this year but also a 51% increase over the previous week’s fatalities —the sharpest increase yet in the weekly fatality count. Meanwhile, Karnataka became the fourth state in March to post over 3,000 fresh cases in a day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/biggest-weekly-jump-in-covid-cases-till-date-deaths-up-51/articleshow/81740244.cms||Amit Bhattacharya

The testing was also increased to 2,254, the highest in this month. More deaths have also been confirmed. “It takes a few days after transmission for the case fatality rate to increase. Thus, within the last few days, there have been a few deaths in the city,” said a public health expert. There were 18 deaths in February, while 25 deaths have been reported till date. From March1 until March 20, nine deaths were reported. The count started increasing from March 25, when three deaths were confirmed.

While the Government Multi-Specialty Hospital (GMSH), Sector16, is also handling mild to moderate Covid-19 cases. “50 patients are admitted to our hospital. We have been consistently taking the samples for tests. As the OPDs are fully functional and vaccination is also going, our hands are full,” said a senior doctor at the GMSH-16. While the total positivity rate on Sunday was 13%, the total weekly positivity rate is 12%, standing again second to that of Maharashtra. The national average is 5%.

Bhavesh Manglani (top) and Mohit Tandon, two of the five original co-founders of Delhivery, have 'stepped aside' from day-to-day operations. They have also been 'reclassified' as 'retiring/non-active promoters' for their stake in Delhivery. This, sources added, has been done keeping in mind that promoters would have a lock-in period before they can sell their shares after an IPO. The proposal of Manglani and Tandon leaving Delhivery was taken to Delhivery's board earlier this year and the same has been approved, sources added. "Both of them have left the firm and one of them might start up again," a person aware of the matter said. Both Manglani and Tandon may consider selling their shares during Delhivery's expected IPO in 2021 or 2022. A Delhivery spokesperson confirmed the developments to TOI. "After 10 years of building Delhivery, two of the five co-founders have decided to move on to pursue other interests," she added. Besides Manglani, an IIM, Calcutta alumnus, and Tandon, an IIT Kanpur alumnus, Sahil Barua, Kapil Bharati and Suraj Saharan are the other co-founders of the 10-year-old venture. All the five founders together hold under 10% stake in the firm. Barua is also the CEO of Delhivery. Marquee names like SoftBank, Tiger Global, Carlyle and Canada's pension fund are among its prominent investors. Delhivery is in the middle of talks to raise a pre-IPO round at a valuation of around $3 billion, reported earlier this month. Prior to this, Zomato co-founder Pankaj Chaddah left the online food delivery firm in 2018 in one of the first such high profile exits of a co-founder from a top internet startup. Chaddah went on to start a new venture Mindhouse, a mental wellness startup.

---||Mumbai||Covid positivity rate in Maharashtra past its peak of July ’20||NEW DELHI: Maharashtra is fit for imposing a fresh lockdown in its containment zones with the Covid-19 positivity rate, total confirmed cases per 100 tests, doubling almost every fortnight since January 26. It has gone up to 21.4% (March 14-27), well past its peak of July last year. Punjab, Goa, Madhya Pradesh and Puducherry have entered the red zone, too, with their infection rates ranging between 5% and 7%, the highest being 7% in Punjab. Kerala, which has reported over 11 lakh cases so far, the second highest after Maharashtra, has managed to bring its positivity rate below 4% during the last 14-day period. The increase in Maharashtra has been consistent — from 4.7% (January 26-February 8) to 7.7% the following fortnight and 13% during March 1-14. A high positivity rate is indicative of the fact that the state is only testing the sickest and not conducting enough tracing, testing and isolation of patients. As per a World Health Organisation advisory, issued in May last year, governments should consider relaxing lockdown in containment zones only if positivity rate remains 5% or lower for at least 14 days. There are currently four states and a Union Territory that qualify for lockdowns. A TOI study found that Kerala has managed to contain the spread of the virus despite a second wave hitting the state badly. It has brought down the positivity rate from 9% (January 26-February 8) to 7% in the following two-week period, to 4% in the first fortnight of March and to 3.6% (March14-27). Cases are rapidly growing in Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Karnataka, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/covid-positivity-rate-in-maharashtra-past-its-peak-of-july-20/articleshow/81741724.cms||Pradeep Thakur

Hence, the chief secretary should plan a lockdown strategy to ensure that the supply of essential commodities, including food grain and medicines, and health services are not hampered. This is what we have to do if people are not following the (Covid) norms.” Coronavirus live updates  Mumbai, too, recorded its highest ever tally of 6,933 new cases on Sunday. Cases in Maharashtra have risen exponentially over the past fortnight, with 3.9 lakh people testing positive for the virus. “Lockdown is the last resort, but we have to consider it because the healthcare infrastructure is crumbling. There are no beds available in the private sector and public-sector beds, too, are filling fast,” task force member Dr Shashank Joshi said.   At the meeting, CM Thackeray pointed out that the 50% attendance norm was not being followed by most private establishments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/prepare-lockdown-plan-maharashtra-cm-uddhav-thackeray-to-chief-secretary/articleshow/81741754.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar

This levy was expected to end this month but has been extended by a year — the situation will be reviewed this December — due to a drastic fall in passenger numbers since the Covid outbreak. The Airports Economic Regulatory Authority (AERA) had in December 2012 allowed Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL) a levy of DF of Rs 100 and Rs 600 per departing domestic and international passenger, respectively, to cover a deficit of Rs 3,845 crore in airport project financing, up to April 30, 2021. In 2016, MIAL was allowed to charge a levy of Rs 20 and Rs 120 per departing domestic and international passenger, respectively, to finance the metro works to garner Rs 518 crore. Both these levies were merged to a combined DF of Rs 120 and Rs 720 per domestic and international embarking passenger, respectively that was to be charged till March 31, 2021. After the outbreak of Covid, passenger numbers dropped drastically at all airports, including Mumbai Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA), and the collections went awry.  “… request was received from MIAL for extension of period of levy (in September 2020) due to shortfall in the collection of both the levies…. Airports Authority of India (AAI) confirmed that as on March 31, 2020, Rs 524.6 crore are yet to be collected under project DF, and, a deficit of Rs 102.7 crore is to be collected under metro DF,” AERA says in its order last week. The April 2020-January 2021 period saw the number of domestic and international passengers fall by 76.4% and 91.9%, respectively, over same period last year. “As a result, collection of DF during the period April 2020 to March 2021 is expected to be much less than the anticipated amount and the deficit would not be covered by March 31, 2021. 31.03.2021,” the order said. "However, the traffic projections for financial year 2021-22 and financial year 2022-23 are tentative and may change depending on the Covid situation and other economic factors, and collections may vary from the present calculations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/flyers-out-of-mumbai-to-keep-paying-development-fee-for-a-year-more/articleshow/81741723.cms||Saurabh Sinha
---||World||Joe Biden: Myanmar bloodshed 'absolutely outrageous'||YANGON: US President Joe Biden on Sunday decried the bloodshed unleashed against anti-coup protesters in Myanmar as "absolutely outrageous," after security forces killed more than 100 people including at least seven children. Myanmar has been in turmoil since the military ousted and detained civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi on February 1, triggering mass protests demanding a return to democracy. On Saturday, at least 107 people were killed across Myanmar as security forces opened fire on protesters. "It's terrible," Biden told reporters in brief remarks he gave in his home state of Delaware. "It's absolutely outrageous and based on the reporting I've gotten, an awful lot of people have been killed totally unnecessarily." Saturday's killings came after the junta staged a major show of might for its annual Armed Forces Day. The European Union described the deadly violence as "unacceptable". "Far from celebrating, the Myanmar military has made yesterday a day of horror and of shame," EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said in a statement. The condemnation came after the defence chiefs of 12 countries including the United States, Britain, Japan and Australia denounced the Myanmar military. "A professional military follows international standards for conduct and is responsible for protecting -- not harming -- the people it serves," the rare joint statement said. "We urge the Myanmar Armed Forces to cease violence and work to restore respect and credibility with the people of Myanmar that it has lost through its actions." According to a local monitoring group, the death toll from crackdowns since the coup has climbed to at least 423. Funerals were held Sunday for some of the victims, after the bloodiest day since the putsch. In Mandalay, the family of Aye Ko, a father-of-four, commemorated his life at a service after he was killed overnight. "I am very saddened to lose my husband -- together with my children I'm heartbroken," his wife Ma Khaing told AFP. Relatives of 13-year-old boy Sai Waiyan, who was shot Saturday playing outside his house in Yangon, cried over his casket on Sunday afternoon, local media reported. Despite the dangers, protesters hit the streets again Sunday in parts of Yangon including Hlaing, and in the cities of Dawei, Bago, Myingyan and Monywa. State-run media confirmed two men and two women were killed at Monywa on Sunday. There was also a death in Myingyan -- one woman was killed and two others injured, a medic said. At Hlaing, a 16-year-old boy lost a hand in a blast, trying to throw back a grenade that security forces had lobbed at protesters, a rescue worker said. A day earlier there were brutal military crackdowns at more than 40 locations across the country. The Mandalay and Yangon regions saw the majority of deaths, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP). The UN put Saturday's death toll at 107 people -- including seven children -- but expected it to rise further. "The shameful, cowardly, brutal actions of the military and police -- who have been filmed shooting at protesters as they flee, and who have not even spared young children -- must be halted immediately," United Nations envoys Alice Wairimu Nderitu and Michelle Bachelet said in a joint statement. Henrietta Fore, the executive director for the UN's children's agency UNICEF, said 10 children reportedly had been shot and killed Saturday. "In addition to the immediate impacts of the violence, the longer-term consequences of the crisis for the country's children could be catastrophic," Fore said in a statement. Military-run broadcaster Myawaddy TV reported Saturday's death toll was 45, noting 552 people had been arrested and claimed it was an unavoidable crackdown because protesters used real guns and bombs against security forces. Rebels in eastern Myanmar's Karen state said they had been targeted in air strikes late Saturday, hours after the ethnic armed group seized a military base. Hsa Moo, an ethnic Karen and human rights activist, said three people were killed and at least eight injured. It was the first air assault in 20 years in the state, and targeted the Fifth Brigade of the Karen National Union (KNU) -- one of the country's largest armed groups -- which says it represents the ethnic Karen people. Further air strikes on Sunday sent 2,000 people from two villages in Karen state darting through the jungle across the border into Thailand seeking safety, Hsa Moo told AFP. A grand parade of troops and military vehicles in the capital Naypyidaw on Saturday saw junta leader General Min Aung Hlaing defend the coup and pledge to yield power after new elections. But he also issued a threat to the anti-coup movement, warning that acts of "terrorism which can be harmful to state tranquillity and security" were unacceptable. On Saturday night Min Aung Hlaing and his wife entertained dignitaries including Russian deputy defence minister Alexander Fomin at a lavish outdoor dinner in Naypyidaw. State-run newspaper the Mirror reported there were musical performances and a drone display featuring a representation of Min Aung Hlaing saluting. Armed Forces Day commemorates the start of local resistance to the Japanese occupation during World War II, and usually features a parade attended by foreign military officers and diplomats||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/joe-biden-myanmar-bloodshed-absolutely-outrageous/articleshow/81741757.cms||---
---||Noida||Man who shot guard was laid off, came back for burglary||Ghaziabad: A 33-year-old former security manager, who lost his job during the pandemic last year, attempted a burglary in his company in Noida’s Sector 2 and shot a guard dead when the victim identified him, police have learnt. It was on February 9 that Uttam, the guard at the company, had challenged Arun Gehlot when he scaled the wall using a ladder and tried to sneak into the office. A fight ensued between the two and Uttam managed to pull away Arun’s mask. Identified, Arun allegedly whipped out a gun, shot Uttam dead and fled. On Saturday night, Arun, a resident of Delhi’s Najafgarh, was arrested near the Sector 16 underpass. Police said Arun himself had hired Uttam during his tenure as the security manager of the company, which feeds cash into ATMs. “Arun Gehlot has told his interrogators that he was angry with the management after losing his job. He said he had helped the company when it needed him to, but he was still sacked. He then devised a robbery plan. As the security manager, he was anyway familiar with the company’s systems. On February 9, he reached Sector 2 in an auto-rickshaw and left it a few metres away from the company’s office,” said Ranvijay Singh, additional DCP (zone 1). Arun, Singh said, used a ladder to scale the wall and get inside the office premises. But he was seen by Uttam, who challenged him. During the fight between the two, Arun was unmasked, which prompted him to shoot the guard dead. Police said Arun had joined the CRPF as a sub-inspector in 2003 and retired as an assistant commandant in 2014. He worked in several private companies after that and joined the one in Sector 2 as regional security manager in 2018. He lost his job along with a few others in September last year. “He only had given Uttam the job of a guard at the company,. He was shocked by the company’s decision to lay him off,” a colleague said. A pistol and three live cartridges were found with Arun. He has been booked under Section 302 (punishment for murder) of the IPC. He will be produced in court on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/man-who-shot-guard-was-laid-off-came-back-for-burglary/articleshow/81740497.cms||Avishek Kumar Dubey
---||Noida||UP: Two masterminds yet to be arrested in MBBS seat fraud||NOIDA: Noida police claim to be probing the role of two unidentified men who they suspect are the masterminds behind the multi-crore MBBS fraud. The duo operated by liasioning with the staff of government medical colleges in Banda and Allahabad to arrange meetings of their targets — students and their parents — inside the premises, officials said. ACP-2 Rajnish Verma said the two accused would give money to the junior staff like the sweepers of the colleges to arrange the meetings on the campus. “During the real counselling sessions, the date and timing would be informed to the accused beforehand,” additional DCP (Noida) Ranvijay Singh said. “If the session got over around 1.30 pm, the accused would sneak into the college using their links around 1.45-2 pm on the pretext of the meeting with the officials and then would meet their potential victims pretending to be the dean or principal,” he said. “The accused would then demand money anywhere between Rs 50-60 lakh for the admission of the students who could not qualify the NEET exam through the dean’s or management quota,” Singh added. At times, the accused would claim that the dean or the principal of the college was very busy and he could only meet the targets for five minutes while walking inside the college premises and not in office, ACP-2 Verma said. “One complainant from Noida was made to meet a ‘dean’ in Motilal Nehru College, Allahabad.” Verma said the accused — Pankaj Kumar Khatik, Adarsh and Sachin — were merely pawns. “The two persons whose identities are yet to be revealed are the masterminds,” he added. Noida police say that they have already contacted the officials of the medical colleges. “We contacted them but they have denied any information about the movement of the accused inside their premises,” additional DCP (Noida) Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/two-masterminds-yet-to-be-arrested-in-mbbs-seat-fraud/articleshow/81740514.cms||Shikha Salaria
---||Business||'Need clarity on direct listing overseas'||ReNew Power is the first major Indian company to opt for the Special Purpose Acquisition Company or SPAC route to list on Nasdaq, valuing the entity at $4.4 billion. In an interview, ReNew Power CMD Sumant Sinha explains the rationale and regulatory challenges. Excerpts: When did you think of SPAC?For a couple of months, we have been talking to a few SPACs. It was a new concept. So, it took us time to understand it and warm up to it. Only early this year we started work on the one that we finally ended up doing. Did you consider a direct listing?We did. For us, the big consideration was that we wanted to be listed. We wanted to raise some primary capital. We wanted to give an exit to our shareholders and have a liquid currency through the stock market. The SPAC is just another way to get there. There hasn't been an Indian listing in the US for a very long time. The India renewable story was well received. The India growth story was well received. How is this different from a direct listing that the government is talking about?A direct listing allows you as an Indian company, as an Indian domiciled company to list on an overseas exchange. Some fundamental things still have to be clarified. The tax implications of how things will work for foreign and Indian investors are still being worked through. For example, it was recently clarified by Sebi that you had to follow the listing jurisdiction or the norms of the jurisdiction where you have listed. Before the clarification it was not clear whether you had to follow Indian listing requirements also. The second difference is that you can't do a SPAC transaction if you're an Indian domiciled company because then Indian tax rules are also applicable. For a company like yours, what is a bigger risk, change of technology or regulation and the problems in states?Obviously, policy and regulatory risk is always an issue. This risk is not so much at the central government level. The issue really is at the state level where things are also driven by populist considerations. That does cause problems, and delayed payments is a very clear example of that. We have been living through that for many years now and have learned to manage with such issues. But that increases the risk premium in the sector. Ultimately, we have to charge higher tariffs, which has to be paid by the consumer. I wish people recognise and realise that in the long-term, it's in the interest of consumers that discoms are healthy and perform efficiently. Technology is evolving very rapidly in our space, and it requires us to always be on our toes. How much of your equipment reliance is on China?Wind turbines are entirely made in India. In solar panels and solar modules, you should assume that almost 80-90% of the industry relies on Chinese imports.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/need-clarity-on-direct-listing-overseas/articleshow/81741930.cms||Sidhartha
---||World||Covid: Snap lockdown ordered in Australia's Brisbane||BRISBANE: More than two million people in Brisbane were ordered into a three-day lockdown Monday after a cluster of coronavirus cases was detected in Australia's third-biggest city. It is the second snap lockdown of Brisbane and the city's surrounds this year, coming after seven people tested positive for Covid-19 -- the first significant community outbreak in Australia in weeks. "This is the UK strain. It is highly infectious. Now we need to do this now to avoid a longer lockdown," Queensland state Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said. "We've seen what's happened in other countries. I don't want to see that happen to Queensland, I don't want to see that happen to Australia." Schools, restaurants and bars will close from 5:00pm Monday but people will still be allowed to leave home for essential work, to buy food, exercise and for medical care. Wearing masks in public is also becoming mandatory across Queensland, after one infectious person travelled to the regional town of Gladstone. The number of international flight arrivals will be halved, to ease pressure on hospitals also dealing with a surge in Covid-19 cases from neighbouring Papua New Guinea. Australia has been relatively successful in curbing the spread of Covid-19, with just over 29,000 cases and 909 deaths during the pandemic to date. However the country's vaccine rollout has been sluggish, with just over 500,000 shots administered so far in a country of 25 million. Palaszczuk said lockdowns would "be part of the Australian way of life until everyone is vaccinated". Before the announcement, Brisbane was among several Australian cities enjoying relaxed restrictions with residents able to freely attend events including concerts and sporting matches.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/covid-snap-lockdown-ordered-in-australias-brisbane/articleshow/81741936.cms||---

Despite tight security arrangements, a few of them managed to hurl stones and slippers at the convoy. Police resorted to mild caning to disperse the protesters who demanded Shivakumar’s resignation for allegedly hatching a political conspiracy to defame their leader Ramesh Jarkiholi using a woman. Shivakumar had come to the city ahead of party candidate for Belagavi Lok Sabha elections — Satish Jarkiholi — filing his nomination papers. However, DCP (L&O) Vikram Amte denied the incident, saying none hurled slippers and pelted stones at vehicles during the commotion. Inside the airport, Shivakumar deflected the protests against his arrival and claimed the supporters of Jarkiholi are “envious of his good work”. He said the Congress had chosen a more “well-behaved” Satish — brother of Ramesh Jarkiholi — to contest and that the state unit will strive tirelessly for his victory. ‘Govt protecting Jarkiholi’ Meanwhile, a day after Shivakumar was hinted as the ‘mahanayaka’ behind the release of the controversial CD, the Congress came out in the open to defend him. Party functionaries demanded that Jarkiholi be arrested under rape charges and accused the government of protecting him. “We’ve been demanding that the case be handed over to the chief justice-monitored special investigation team, but the government is not responding. An SIT inquiry cannot ensure justice,” said KPCC working president Saleem Ahmed. Opposition leader Siddaramaiah said the case reflects badly on the state police as they could not trace the young woman who was allegedly seen with Jarkiholi in the CD. “It has been more than 26 days after the first CD surfaced, but till now police could not find where the woman is. As far as her request to provide protection is concerned, we can help only if she comes out in public and records her statement with the SIT. Appealing from a secret palace will not help,” he said. Home minister Basavaraj Bommai continued to defend police and said the ongoing agitations from both Congress and BJP camps will have no bearing on the SIT investigation. “The SIT is probing all angles. Notice has been served on the woman five times and still, we are ready to give protection to her,” he said. Meanwhile, Congress workers have decided to launch a state-wide protest on Monday, condemning the alleged attack on Shivakumar’s convoy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/cd-scandal-ramesh-jarkiholi-supporters-hurl-slippers-at-dks-convoy-in-belagavi/articleshow/81741969.cms||---

Sandhya, a teacher at Belmadota Government Primary School, Derlakatte, was on cloud nine after getting her results, and is thankful to the state government for the opportunity to continue her education. “In 2010, it allowed government schoolteachers to complete their graduation, and I was one of the eligible candidates among 500 teachers in Karnataka. I was appointed a government schoolteacher in 2007, after I completed my PU and TCH training course,” said Sandhya, who secured ninth rank by scoring 85% in the BA examination held in 2019-20. It was a challenging task ahead, and her journey was not a bed of roses. She joined the course at University College, Hampankatta, in 2017. “With two young children aged10 and 6, balancing family and education was hectic. I did think many a time why I took up this course, but now I am happy that I have completed it by securing a rank,” she said, adding that she was the senior-most student in her class, and all her classmates would address her as ‘akka’. She had to take a break from higher studies, after completing PU. “Poverty forced me to take a sabbatical. If I had to continue my education, my siblings — a brother and sisterwouldn’t have been able to complete their studies. I had a strong desire to complete my graduation, and my dream came true after many years,” she said. Sandhya is the wife of art and Hindi teacher Premanath Marne, and resides at Akashabhavan. She will be one among the rank holders to receive a degree at the convocation on April 10. She thanked BEO South Rajalaxmi K and college lecturers for her success.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/mangaluru-at-37-govt-schoolteacher-gets-9th-rank-in-ba/articleshow/81741998.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Arrested drug peddlers were liquor transporters earlier||BENGALURU: Investigation into last week’s 500-kg marijuana haul by KR Puram police revealed that the accused had switched from a legal interstate liquor transportation business to drug peddling in March. According to police, accused Dayalram, 38, Poonaram, 24, and Buddaram, 23 — all from Jodhpur in Rajasthan — would transport liquor legally from manufacturing units to warehouses or dealers. However, there is no such business for a month in March every year, with new rules slated to kick in during April. Hence the accused were in search of an alternative business to earn quick money. “The accused trio discussed the matter with a person identified as Neeraj from Odisha, who is also in the transportation business. Neeraj explained to them about ganja business and assured them that he would help them if they were interested. The trio purchased ganja from Neeraj and brought it to Bengaluru to supply it to peddlers here,” an investigating officer said. Preliminary probe revealed Neeraj had arranged ganja from Odisha and sent the consignment to a place near Visakhapatnam, where the accused trio picked it up. “We produced the accused trio before a court on Friday and they were remanded in police custody. We are investigating the case to find out the source of the drug and other details. So far we have learnt that Neeraj had organised it for the trio. We may be able to trace Neeraj’s source of ganja once we nab him,” an investigating officer said. In an undercover operation, city police busted the drugsmuggling racket on Friday by arresting three persons and seizing 500kg of ganja from them. The consignment was worth over Rs 1 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-arrested-drug-peddlers-were-liquor-transporters-earlier/articleshow/81742058.cms||---

Abdul Aleem, president, Changemakers of Kanakapura Road, said: “We are not sure to what extent the fire has damaged the forest. But considering there are so many species of birds, the biodiversity of the forest has surely been impacted.” He further added: “It has been over a month since more than 4,000 residents hit the road demanding Turahalli forest be protected by putting up a fence, installing CCTV cameras and increasing the number of guards. The forest department has failed to provide these facilities, leading to incidents like this.” Residents said dousing the flames was a Herculean task because the forest has no peripheral roads through which fire tenders could move in. Soumya Kashyap, a member of Clean Up Turahalli, said, “I have been residing close to the forest for nearly six years. Every summer, we face this situation but we all know the fire does not occur naturally. Last year, we didn’t see any blaze due to the lockdown. We expect the authorities to add CCTVs and at least plan a peripheral road that can prove helpful during such emergencies.” Residents fear that with two more months of summer left, more such fires are possible. Range forest officer Gopal AA agreed that the fire was man-made and not natural. “We have filed an FIR but all we know at the moment is that it is man-made. We have increased the number of guards on night duty from two to three and are awaiting more details,” he said. Burnt body found Following Saturday’s forest fire, Talaghattapura police on Sunday afternoon discovered the burnt body of a man near Gowdanapalya close to the affected area. Police sources said they are yet to identify the dead man, but that he appeared to be 30-35 years old. There were signs of fire at the place where the body was found. “Fire-fighters doused the flames on Sunday. When officials were about to enter the forest to check loss of habitat, they noticed the body in a drain. We have sent it for postmortem. It appears the person got burnt in the fire,” sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/turahalli-forest-fire-raises-biodiversity-concerns/articleshow/81742086.cms||---

Union home minister Amit Shah recently said with Modi as PM and BS Yediyurappa as CM, Karnataka has a double-engine government to drive growth in the state. However, many projects continue to be on the slow track. While the much-delayed Sir M Visvesvaraya Terminal in Byappanahalli is ready, it awaits inauguration. “We’re yet to get a date from the Prime Minister’s Office because of elections in multiple states,” said an SWR official. This is also the first centralised AC railway terminal, which will offer an airport-like experience to passengers. The Rs 314-crore station is expected to cater to a footfall of 50,000. Bengalurueans are also eagerly waiting for the foundation stone-laying ceremony of the long-pending suburban rail project. Though the Rs 15,657-crore project was cleared by the Centre in October 2020, no formal announcement has been made so far. The Centre and state government allocated Rs 800 crore and Rs 850 crore, respectively, for the project during 2021-22 budget. Rail Infrastructure Development Company Karnataka Limited (K-RIDE), which is executing the works, said they have finalised consultancy tenders on design, land acquisition, station planning, geotechnical survey and investigation and utility mapping. “We will soon float tenders for civil work of two corridors: Byappanahalli-Yeshwantpur-Chikkabanavara (25km) and Heelalige-Yelahanka-Rajanukunte (46km). The PM is expected to lay the foundation stone for the project,” said an official. The suburban rail proposal was announced in the 2018-19 Union budget and cleared by the railway board in November 2019. This will be the first modern suburban train system in the country. Commuter trains operating on the proposed network will be similar to Metro. The inauguration of the re-developed Yeshwantpur railway station is also pending. The station has been upgraded with better passenger amenities under the Rs 10-crore Yeshwantpur redevelopment work. Namma Metro’s Outer Ring Road-Kempegowda International Airport line is yet to get Union cabinet’s nod. In 2016, BMRCL had prepared a DPR for ORR Metro (Silk Board-KR Puram) and also finalised the tender last year. However, it is yet to issue a work order due to delay in getting Centre's approval. It is yet to finalise the tender for KR Puram-KIA Metro corridor due to the delay. “Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) was supposed to clear it by March, but it was postponed because of state elections. Public Investment Board (PIB) has already cleared it and the finance ministry has approved the draft cabinet note. We are hoping that it will be cleared by April,” said a BMRCL official. Tara Krishnaswamy, co-founder of Citizens for Bengaluru, an NGO, said: “Political executives in India should be barred from campaigning and they should focus on governance. They are paid by the taxpayers and they should be accountable to the public rather than merely working as partymen.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/elections-in-four-states-delay-key-infra-projects-in-bengaluru/articleshow/81742100.cms||Christin Mathew Philip
---||Bengaluru||Budget outlay unrealistic, may be cut down by govt: Experts||BENGALURU: A day after the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike budget for 2021-22 was tabled and passed by the Palike administrator in the absence of an elected council, experts said the projected expenditure of Rs 9,287 crore appears to be unrealistic when compared to the revenue position. Tulasi Muddineni, BBMP special commissioner (finance), who presented the budget, projected the civic agency’s own revenue less than 50% of the total expenditure (Rs 9,287 crore) after cutting down the property tax target from Rs 3,538 crore in 2020-21 to Rs 2,800. crore in the new fiscal. This, when other cities like Mumbai and Pune have seen a budget outlay which shows 60% of the total expenditure is covered by those civic bodies’ own revenue. It is said the reduction in property tax targets for 2021-22 was induced by the failure of revenue officials to reach their 2020-21 goals which fell short by over Rs 1,500 crore. Against a target of Rs 3,538, BBMP collected only Rs 2,021 crore for the fiscal. With such being the situation, there has been an increased overdependence on grants from the government, which is estimated to be Rs 4,266 crore for the current fiscal, including that from the devolution of funds under the 15th finance commission and the state finance commission. Sources, however, said it is unlikely that the government will grant the expected amount given the sluggishness of its finances. The Palike’s budget outlay may be cut down by the department of urban development when it is sent for approval, they added. Unlike last year, when there was a cut of only Rs 254 crore compared to the BBMP outlay of Rs 10,899 crore, this fiscal the government may slash the budget in a bigger fashion owing to reduction in projections for property tax collection — the biggest revenue generator for BBMP. Experts pointed out the Palike’s precarious practice to project higher outlays in the beginning and revising them downwards towards the year-end. It is calculated that the variance between the budget estimate and actual expenditure of the BBMP budget averaged at 31% since 2016-17, while other cities including Mumbai (9%), Chennai (15%), Ahmedabad (8%) and Surat (5%), boast an average of budget variance under 15%. “This means BBMP has only spent about only 69% of its budget outlay all these years. As far as this year’s budget is concerned, it could have been more realistic. However, there are attempts from BBMP to make it realistic,” said Sapna Karim, head, civic participation at Janaagraha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/budget-outlay-unrealistic-may-be-cut-down-by-govt-experts/articleshow/81742143.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||No students, Bengaluru’s oldest Kannada school shuts down||BENGALURU: The Model High School in Chamarajpet — Bengaluru’s first Kannada-medium school started in the summer of 1870 with approval from the British administration — has faded into oblivion with student enrolments completely stopping three years ago. What remains of the historic school on 4th Main Road in Chamarajpet are faded blackboards, broken furniture and dilapidated classrooms. Even the nameboard of the school has been wiped clean. The abandoned building is a mute testimony to the school’s sesquicentennial (150th year celebration) that never was. The long hall of the institution with tall ceilings was where many who were initiated into first words of Kannada language went on to become famous names of Karnataka. Cricket legend GR Viswanath and film star Vishnuvardhan are among the school’s illustrious alumni. Higher secondary wing closed in 2017 due to poor enrolmentAn aided institution, Model High School began as a primary school and got its higher secondary wing in 1957. The school had an elaborate midday meals scheme for students. A mural on the board that has survived the vagaries of time shows what every student was given for lunch. According to block education officer (south) LH Muthaiah, lack of student enrolment was a deathblow for the city’s oldest Kannada-medium school. “The student numbers kept depleting year after year before it was shut down,” he added. Sources said the school’s higher secondary wing was closed in late 2017 as there was no student enrolment in Kannada medium. At that point, then Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah had said no Kannada medium school would be closed. But the CM’s promise did no good, and the school’s primary section, too, shut down in early 2018. Today, the Model High School is only in the memory of its alumni and, occasionally, a subject of discussion on social media regarding its bygone pride.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengalurus-oldest-kannada-school-misses-150th-anniversary/articleshow/81742170.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Bhopal: Plane crash site turns into sight-seeing zone||BHOPAL: The wreckage of the small plane that crashed in wheat fields near Bhopal airport turned into a selfie spot on Sunday, although a lockdown was in force. For most people in Bishenkheri, the village closest to the crash site, it was the first sight of a real plane. Police have cordoned off the area but that didn’t stop selfie-seekers and the curious from flocking to the site. “It’s the first time I’m seeing a plane from up close,” gushed Bishenkheri’s Manish Kushwaha. A probe team from DGCA also went to the crash site and began its investigation. They spoke to villagers who had seen the plane go down. The Pinnacle Air P68 Observer-II aircraft (VT-TAA) had crash-landed in the field just minutes after taking off from Raja Bhoj Airport on Saturday afternoon. Captains Ashwani Kumar and Raj Kumar and passenger Asim Texali, director operations of Pinnacle Air, had a miraculous escape and were discharged from hospital after first-aid. All of Sunday morning, people kept trickling to the crash site. The numbers swelled in the evening, after farmers finished work for the day. Class 12 student Manish said he wanted to see the plane on Saturday but was stopped by his parents. “I have never seen an aircraft from so close. I was excited. I am happy that everyone survived the crash,” said Manish. The crowd was not allowed to go close to the wreckage. Some people were seen requesting the authorities to be allowed to take a selfie from up close, but they were barred and had to be content with long shots. “I wanted to click a selfie with the plane but could take only a few from a distance,” said Shyam Sahu, a resident of Gandhi Nagar. “I had heard about it yesterday. Later, I saw it on TV. Curious has brought me here today,” said Mohit Prasad, a private firm employee and resident of nearby Pewarkheda village. Some turned up with their families. “My children wanted to see it. I brought them along but police aren’t allowing us anywhere near it,” said Vikrant Sisodiya, a resident of Old City.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/bhopal-plane-crash-site-turns-into-sight-seeing-zone/articleshow/81742146.cms||Ramendra Singh

Sanjay Soni was caught by the district police on charges of committing two different thefts, the last on March 26, the day he wanted to perform the ‘terahvi’ or the death feast of his father. A resident of Lavkush Nagar, Soni was allegedly involved in cutting the bags of two bank customers on March 23 and 26. In the first case, he decamped with Rs3.40 lakh from the bag of one Ramswaroom Tiwari, a bank customer. In another case on March 26, he was involved in a similar crime and stole Rs49,000. In both the cases, he was assisted by his accomplices, police said. “The other accused are still on the run and will be arrested soon,” said police. Soni said he had no money and wanted to host the death feast of his father for the whole village with the cash that he had stolen. Police said that his father was also involved in petty crime cases and had died while being brought from Chitrakoot to Chhatarpur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-man-loots-bank-customers-for-terahvi-feast-of-father-in-chhatarpur-district/articleshow/81742212.cms||---
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu assembly polls: AIADMK main players stay mum on 10.5% vanniyar quota in campaigns||Days after the AIADMK government conceded the PMK’s demand for the 10.5% vanniyar quota, a quiet campaign hit social media. In a oneminute film, three government schoolboys lament the difficulty for members of their community to get a medical seat in a government college. One boy points out that “thanks to Dr Ramadoss Aiyya’s 40-year struggle, the vanniyar community has got 10.5% reservation”. This meant that of 1,000 medical seats, 105 seats would be reserved for vanniyars, the student explains. The film brings to mind the protracted bargaining that compelled the AIADMK government to give in to the PMK. But as campaigning gathered pace for the April 6 assembly election, neither the PMK nor the AIADMK is crowing over the quota achievement. This is because the implications for caste and political dynamics are farreaching. Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami steers clear of the subject even in his own vanniyardominant Edappadi assembly constituency. As for his deputy O Panneerselvam, who is battling to retain his Bodinayakanur constituency in the mukkulathor-dense southern region, he knows bringing up the subject could cost him dearly. Both leaders do not wish to antagonise the non-vanniyar caste groups. “Even before a decision was taken on the internal reservation for vanniyars within the 20% MBC quota, AIADMK district secretaries were summoned for a meeting. Each one worked out the caste calculations and the ramifications the announcement would have for constituencies in their districts,” said a senior AIADMK leader, seeking anonymity. For the PMK, its biggest worry is vote transferability. “In the 120 vanniyar-dominant constituencies, particularly in the north and western parts, the AIADMK would not have much trouble getting votes from the community. But would the PMK benefit from a non-vanniyar vote transfer that covers naidus, mudaliars and naickers,” wondered an AIADMK leader. Dalit hostility is another worry for the PMK. So, ‘Doctor Aiyya’ was careful not to refer to the quota achievement while campaigning in Chepauk in Chennai or Jayankondan in the central Ariyalur district. His son Anbumani Ramadoss, however, has no reservations talking about it during electioneering. But he is careful to mention that they would fight for similar reservation for all backward communities. “All second-rung AIADMK leaders speak about the vanniyar quota as the CM’s achievement and promise similar quotas for other backward communities too. But we are careful to bring it up only in the vanniyar-dominant constituencies,” said a senior AIADMK leader. In the thevar pockets in the south, constituencies in the west with sizeable kongu vellalar voters and many of the central districts, leaders go silent on the quota issue. “I can’t afford to say ‘we won, we won’ on the vanniyar quota issue. It’s bound to be an irritant for the other castes,” said M Thilagabhama, PMK’s candidate in Attur constituency in southern Dindigul.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-assembly-polls-aiadmk-main-players-stay-mum-on-10-5-vanniyar-quota-in-campaigns/articleshow/81742178.cms||Jaya Menon

Asserting that the Centre is keeping a close watch on the functioning of the Punjab government with regard to the handling of violent protests against the new farm laws, the cabinet minister said, “We are disturbed and anguished. What is happening in Punjab is quite alarming and disturbing. This will not go for too long, something will have to be done.” The minister was visibly perturbed about the attack on Narang, who was stripped and thrashed brutally by a violent mob in Muktsar and had a narrow escape after cops managed to shut him in a small shop. Striped by the mob, blurred naked pictures of Narang were also in circulation on social media. Reminded that the Punjab chief minister has condemned the incident, the senior minister shot back, “Is condemnation enough? You condemn and it’s over?” He also questioned “double standards” of the media saying, “No one is questioning Punjab chief minister but they would have been hyper active had it been a BJP-ruled state.” He further questioned, “Then why you (media) start chasing and questioning Yogi Adityanath (UP CM) for any incident?” Meanwhile, Punjab Police on Sunday also identified 23 people who were part of the mob of more than 300 persons which assaulted Narang.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mla-assault-centre-keeping-close-watch-on-punjab-govt/articleshow/81742310.cms||---

---||Chennai||Chennai: Vegetable prices dip at Koyambedu, but wholesale potato rates may rise this week||CHENNAI: In a relief to customers, prices of vegetables, which dipped last week, are likely to remain low. Retail traders underscore that the current rates of vegetables are the lowest in the last one year. According to market sources, prices of most vegetables have plunged. V R Soundararajan, former member of market management committee of the Koyambedu Wholesale Market Complex, and a wholesale trader himself, said that the cost of one kilogram of shallot that was being sold for 60 - 80 last week will be available for 30-40 in the week ahead. However, potato prices may increase as its cost has gone up in source states such as Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. "Potato prices are unlikely to reduce further in the coming week. Potatoes alone will go up by 3 to 4 per per kilogram at the wholesale market as the its cost has increased in the source states," he said. The overal dip in prices of vegetables has had an impact in neighbourhood markets. For instance, six kilogram of onion was being sold for 100 through mobile vendors at Porur last week. On Sunday, one kilogram of onion was selling at 25 in Adyar and Ayanavaram. Brinjal was selling at 45-60 while potatoes cost 30-39 at Adyar and Ayanavaram, respectively. S Samuel, a retail vegetable trader in Ayanavaram, said that the present retail rates of vegetables was the lowest in the city in the past one year. "It is an unusual phenomenon that rates of all vegetables have dipped," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-vegetable-prices-dip-at-koyambedu-but-wholesale-potato-rates-may-rise-this-week/articleshow/81742362.cms||---
---||---||Tamil Nadu assembly elections: DMK pins two-time winner C Vijayabaskar to Viralimalai||Like most of his cabinet colleagues, health minister C Vijayabaskar has been meeting his voters day in and day out; it may be more appropriate to say the DMK has pinned him down to his Viralimalai segment. He has won twice – 2011 and 2016 - from Viralimalai and once from Pudukottai, but the going is not easy now. Till the campaign picked up heat, he was a heavyweight in the region and was in charge of electioneering in two districts – Pudukottai and Sivaganga – comprising 10 assembly segments. The ground reality is different now and he has no time to supervise election work in other segments. He ventured out of his constituency only once after the candidates were finalised, said party sources. He has left a huge void for the ruling party in the region and there is hardly any time left for the AIADMK to regain the lost ground as many party rebels have entered the fray as independent candidates. For instance, C Alagu Subbiah, an AIADMK functionary, is contesting as an independent in Thirumayam, protesting against the party denying him ticket. Party functionaries are upset with the AIADMK giving ticket to Dharma Thangavel in Alangudi. He had joined the party only two months ago. The charge against Vijayabaskar is that he ignored the aspirations of many party seniors in candidate selection. In Aranthangi, sitting MLA E Rathinasabapathy is giving trouble for being denied ticket and holds Vijayabaskar responsible for it. The party has fielded a greenhorn in Gandharavakottai reserved constituency, where M Chinnadurai, a CPM veteran, is contesting. Vijayabaskar has been covering every nook and corner of Viralimalai, explaining his efforts in getting the Cauvery-Vaigai-Gundar river linking project sanctioned. The project, once completed, would irrigate arid regions of Pudukottai district. And his promise to voters is that unmindful of his health problems – he lists out diabetes and hypertension – he would work harder to take care of their needs in future. He has roped in his two daughters also to canvass votes. They had campaigned for him in the last election too. Vijayabaskar’s worry is that despite being health minister for long, he hasn’t brought any big health infrastructure project to the constituency. DMK candidate M Palaniappan’s plea to the electorate is that though they had rejected him twice, he did not desert the constituency. If given a chance, he promises to work for its development. The presence of an AMMK candidate, O Karthi Prabhakaran, is worrying Vijayabaskar about the possibility of thevar votes getting split. Still, he should be thankful to his former godfather T T V Dhinakaran for not fielding a heavyweight in Viralimalai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/tamil-nadu/tamil-nadu-assembly-elections-dmk-pins-two-time-winner-c-vijayabaskar-to-viralimalai/articleshow/81742349.cms||K Sambath Kumar

H&M, Burberry, Nike and Adidas and other western brands have been hit by consumer boycotts in China since last week over comments about their sourcing of cotton in Xinjiang. The growing rift comes as the United States and other Western governments increase pressure on China over suspected human rights abuses in the western region. Chinese social media users last week began circulating a 2020 statement by H&M announcing it would no longer source cotton from Xinjiang. H&M said at the time the decision was due to difficulties conducting credible due diligence in the region and after media and human rights' groups reported the use of forced labour in Xinjiang - a charge that Beijing has repeatedly denied. Xu Guixiang, a spokesman for the regional government of Xinjiang, told reporters that a company should not politicise its economic behaviour and said H&M won't be able to make money anymore in the Chinese market because of its statement. Elijan Anayat, another Xinjiang government spokesman, said during the briefing that Chinese people do not want the products of companies such as H&M and Nike that have boycotted Xinjiang's cotton. He invited companies to take trips to the region's cotton fields to see for themselves what is happening. WESTERN SANCTIONS Washington on Friday condemned what it called a "state-led" social media campaign in China against US and other international companies for committing not to use cotton from Xinjiang. The wave of consumer boycotts in China has coincided with a coordinated set of sanctions imposed by Britain, Canada, the European Union and the United States last week over what they say are human rights abuses taking place in Xinjiang. The US government has publicly accused Beijing of genocide against the Uighur Muslim ethnic minorities in the region. Xu repeatedly rejected accusations of genocide and human rights abuses in the region and accused the Western powers of engaging in political manipulation to destabilise China with the sanctions. The United States in January announced an import ban on all cotton and tomato products from the area due to allegations of forced labour from detained Uighur Muslims. Western governments and rights groups have previously accused authorities in the far-western region of detaining and torturing Uighurs in camps, where some former inmates have said they were subject to ideological indoctrination. China has repeatedly denied all such charges and say the camps are for vocational training and combating religious extremism.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/china-warns-companies-against-politicising-actions-regarding-xinjiang/articleshow/81742384.cms||---

He is contesting again from Singanallur. In an interview to TOI’s Nivedha Selvam, the former deputy mayor of Coimbatore says the ₹2,961 crore contract given to a French company for 24x7 water scheme in Coimbatore will be cancelled once the DMK comes to power It’s known terrain for you. But the challenges seem to be different this time.Wherever I go people are showing positive signs. People want MK Stalin to be their next chief minister. I have been in politics for the past three decades and I have campaigned for various elections over the years. But I have never seen such a huge positive response from the public before. People are fed up with the AIADMK government and their alliance with the BJP. MNM candidate R Mahendran says he bagged sizeable votes from Singanallur in the last Lok Sabha election. Do you see him as a challenge?I don’t see Mahendran or anyone else as competition. People choose their candidates differently for each election and this election is completely favourable for DMK. I have been working closely with the public, but outsiders (other candidates) are spreading false allegations that I never meet people from my segment. What have you done with the MLA Local area development fund?I utilized 100 % of the MLA LAD fund given to me. I had constructed a library, check dam near Nanjundapuram, anganwadi centre, created infrastructure for drinking water supply, ration shops, roads and installed solar-powered lamps. I have donated more than Rs 35 lakhs to ESI hospital during the pandemic situation twice. For raising my voice for the public, police have arrested me 100 times and as many as 40 FIRs are registered against me. If elected to power, what you will do for the public?I will take steps to complete all the pending projects. The contract given to Suez India private limited to implement 24X7 water project will be cancelled. But work has begun under the project and money has been spent for laying pipelines.That will not go waste. We will hand over the project to Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board or a local firm with a revised contract, because we don’t oppose the project but the private French firm. Overwhelming response from the youthMNM vice-president R Mahendran surprised many when he bagged 1.45 lakh votes in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in Coimbatore. This time Mahendran is confident of not just a better performance, but of defeating the DMK and the AIADMK in Singanallur. Excerpts from an interview to V Mayilvaganan The DMK MLA has nurtured Singanallur constituency for five years. AIADMK too has a strong organisational apparatus. Are you confident of taking on both parties?I am new to politics and obviously both these candidates are experienced. There are very few constituencies in the state where sitting the DMK MLA is going to lose. Singanallur is one. I know removing both is not easy. But I am contesting because I have the confidence. Like Kamal, you too are branded an outsider.Did they say Kalaignar was an outsider when he contested in Tiruvarur? But Tiruvarur was his native place.Likewise, Coimbatore is my birthplace. What about Jayalalithaa contesting in Andipatti, Srirangam or Bargur and Modi in Varanasi. It means that they have some emotional connect with that place and the desire to make it their political home. How different is this election compared to 2019 Lok Sabha polls?Very different. That election was to decide who out of the national parties shouldn’t come to power. Here it’s about governance. You have a situation of DMK MLA but government is AIADMK and the constituency is not developed. Though he could have done a lot with MLA LAD fund, he hasn’t done. And then, you have situations where MLA is from the ruling party and still there is no development. So what are your challenges?The elderly are reluctant to change their mindsets, though they want a change in governance. But there is overwhelming response from the youth. They will back us and get their parents to back us. One view is that MNM’s support base is limited to youth and the party is present in urban areas only?May be. But let the change begin from urban areas. It will slowly open the floodgates. If we win in a few constituencies, that will pave the way for the future. The second point abut youth – what per cent of youth form the voters today? It’s 40 %. They will be ambassadors for us.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-assembly-elections-2021-seasoned-campaigner-forecasts-win-but-the-challenger-eyes-a-knockout/articleshow/81742412.cms||Nivedha Selvam

The massive container ship has been turned 80 per cent in the right direction, officials said Monday, raising hopes the vital trade route could soon be clear. But its owner said that while the giant ship "has turned", it was still not yet afloat. "The position of the ship has been reorientated 80 percent in the right direction," Rabie in a statement. "The stern... moved to 102 metres (335 feet) from the shore," compared to its position four metres from the shore previously. Efforts to refloat it will resume on the next high tide. The SCA statement said that the refloating process "will resume when water flow increases again from 11:30 local time... in order to completely refloat the vessel, so as to reposition it in the middle of the waterway." For nearly a week, the skyscraper-sized Ever Given hauling goods from Asia to Europe has blocked maritime traffic through the vital artery, holding up $9 billion each day in global trade and straining supply chains already burdened by the coronavirus pandemic. Over 300 vessels, carrying everything from crude oil to cattle, are waiting to pass through the canal, while dozens more are taking the alternate route around the Cape of Good Hope at Africa's southern tip, adding some two weeks to journeys and threatening delivery delays. The partial freeing of the vessel came after intensive efforts to push and pull the vessel with 10 tugboats when the full moon brought spring tide, raising the canal's water level and hopes for a breakthrough. Lt. Gen. Osama Rabei, the head of the Suez Canal Authority, said workers continued ``pulling maneuvers'' to refloat the vessel early Monday. Overnight, several dredgers had toiled to vacuum up 27,000 cubic meters of sand and mud around the ship. Another powerful tugboat, Carlo Magno, was racing to the scene to join the efforts. Although the vessel is vulnerable to damage in its current position, Shoei Kisen Kaisha Ltd., the company that owns the Ever Given, dismissed concerns on Monday, saying that the ship's engine was functional and it could pursue its trip normally when freed. Ship operators did not offer a timeline for the reopening of the crucial canal, which carries over 10% of global trade, including 7% of the world's oil. The unprecedented shutdown could affect oil and gas shipments to Europe from the Middle East. Canal authorities have desperately tried to free the vessel by relying on tugs and dredgers alone, even as analysts warned that 400-meter-long ship may be too heavy for such an operation. As a window for a breakthrough narrows with high tide receding this week, fears have grown that authorities would be forced to lighten the vessel by removing the ship's 20,000 containers _ an complex operation, requiring specialized equipment not found in Egypt, that could take days or weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/stranded-suez-canal-ship-re-floated/articleshow/81742462.cms||---

Linda Reynolds was removed as defence minister and Christian Porter as attorney-general, as Prime Minister Scott Morrison bowed to weeks of mounting public pressure. Porter -- the government's top legal officer and a former state prosecutor -- is accused of raping a 16-year-old fellow student in 1988, an allegation he denies. The woman died last June, reportedly by suicide. Reynolds was accused of mishandling an investigation into the alleged rape of a young staffer in her parliamentary office, and referring to the woman as a "lying cow." Both ministers have been on leave for weeks, with Morrison previously insisting they would return to their jobs. Now, both will remain in government, handling less coveted portfolios of government services for Reynolds, and industry, science and technology for Porter. During the reshuffle Morrison also announced a series of promotions for women, saying it was "the strongest ever female representation in an Australian cabinet." It remains to be seen if the move will be enough to quell a groundswell of public anger at the pervasive culture of bullying, harassment and sexual violence, notably in government. The allegations against Porter and Reynolds spurred protests across Australia, with tens of thousands of women taking to the streets to call for gender equality and an end to sexual violence. In the weeks since the rape allegations surfaced, Morrison's coalition government has been rocked by a litany of new sex abuse and harassment complaints -- from a staff member photographed masturbating on an MP's desk, to a state MP being accused of raping a sex worker, to another MP apologising for harassing women online. A Morrison media blitz aimed at showing his empathy with women has only added to the furore through a series of missteps. The 52-year-old prime minister has at least a year left in his current term, but has seen the crisis erode some popularity garnered from Australia's solid handling of the coronavirus pandemic. The country has just occasional cases of community transmission and life has largely returned to normal. A Newspoll public opinion survey in mid-March showed Morrison's Liberal-led coalition trailing the centre-left Labor opposition by 52-48, with other polls showing signs that his support among women is cratering.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/two-australian-cabinet-ministers-demoted-after-dual-rape-scandals/articleshow/81742468.cms||---

The deceased persons were identified as bus driver Asirvadam of Visakhapatnam railway station to Vizianagaram bus and a RTC driver who was going as a passenger in another bus and a passenger Sanyasi Naidu. Out of 17 injured persons in both buses, nine were shifted to King George Hospital in Vizag and remaining eight were shifted to Vizianagaram government hospital. According to sources, thick smoke covered the entire area when the waste material was burnt by few people. It proved costly to the lives of the people as poor visibility on the road caused the accident.  After learning this Vizianagaram rural police, DSP Anil Kumar and SP B Rajakumari rushed to the spot and started rescue operations. Police personnel timely action saved many passengers and they also cleared the road by deploying the JCBs. The accident spot is close to the AP state police 5th battalion camp and the Battalion commandant J Koteswara Rao and his men helped local police in rescue operations. The driver of the RTC bus going to Visakhapatnam from Palakonda in Srikakulam tried to overtake a gas cylinders lorry. But he was unable to control the lorry and hit another RTC bus coming from Vizag Railway station to Vizianagaram. With that sudden action, the gas cylinders lorry driver could not control his vehicle and hit the back portion of the Palakonda-Vizag RTC bus. Three persons died on the spot 17 people received injuries as they were trapped in between the seats. Locals heard the sound of the accident rushed to the spot and rescued the passengers around 50 in both RTC busses. The Visakha Range DIG LKV Ranga Rao too visited the accident spot and also the hospital where the injured were admitted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/andhra-pradesh-3-killed-and-17-injured-in-accident-in-vizianagaram/articleshow/81742418.cms||Siva G

The state sent the second highest number of workers abroad during this period. Kerala had the highest number of workers going abroad. Data provided by Union minister of state for external affairs V Muraleedharan in the Lok Sabha on March 24 showed that 13.1 lakh people from Tamil Nadu went abroad for work between January 2016 and March 18, 2021. During the same period, 1.9 million people from Kerala travelled abroad for work. Out of the total 1.3 crore job seekers from across the country in the past five years, Kerala and Tamil Nadu accounted for nearly 24%. About 12.6 lakh people flew from Uttar Pradesh for work. The origin states of about 44.3 lakh people who travelled to foreign countries for work were no known. At the same time, 4.7 lakh people returned to Tamil Nadu under the Vande Bharat Mission aimed at repatriation of stranded and distressed Indian nationals across the globe during the pandemic.

But that has little to do with the fact that the species is on the verge of extinction. R Srinivas, a practising lawyer in the Madras high court and one of the few breeders in Chennai of the native dog species, says it is mainly due to poor understanding of raising them and the lack of traditional breeders. Srinivas found a Kombai nearly 10 years ago and began reading about its history. “I started raising them. At present I have three males and four females, all adults, in a kennel at my Nungambakkam house,” he says. A Kombai (Canis lupus familiaris), a native of Periakulam taluk in Theni district, barks very little and looks like a normal country dog. It is not a hound breed, but is used for hunting (illegally) and guarding. An adult can weigh up to 30kg but grows only up to 24 inches in height. Awareness about the breed began increasing only in the last decade and a few people have begun raising Kombais, says Srinivas, adding that a pup now comes for ₹10,000 to ₹20,000. Many of the dogs that were given away to enthusiasts, Srinivas says, have ended up as either most friendly dogs or very aggressive ones mainly due to the poor understanding about them. Some who took Kombai pups from Srinivas, he says, began using them for hunting, which is banned. An adult Kombai can bring down an adult boar, but a sub-adult used for hunting can get killed, he says. But all is not lost. With even Prime Minister Narendra Modi mentioning about Chippiparai and Rajapalayam breeds, the demand for native dog breeds is growing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/why-very-few-rear-kombais-these-days/articleshow/81742611.cms||P Oppili

The husband faced loss in his business and had obtained loans from many persons. He had taken a 20 lakh loan from a man named Karupaiah, who had borrowed the money from someone else. As the lender began demanding the sum, Karupaiah had asked Vijayakumar to return a part of the amount. Vijayakumar had asked him to visit him on Sunday to collect the money. During his visit, Karupaiah found the house closed. As there was no response, the neighbours and Karupaiah alerted the police. The police broke into the house and found the couple hanging from the ceiling in the same room. The child was found dead nearby. Based on a complaint from Vanisri's father Muthukrishnan, a case was registered with the South Gate police station and an inquiry was conducted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madurai-couple-in-debt-murder-their-daughter-selves/articleshow/81742686.cms||---
---||Chennai||Madras University struggling with only 42% teaching staff, diminishing revenues||The triple helical structure of collagen was first revealed by a Madras University professor, G N Ramachandran. Before going to England, mathematical genius Srinivasa Ramanujan spent four years at the university scribbling down the passage to infinity. P J Thomas, a professor from the department of economics, came up with a roadmap to recover from the great depression of the 1930s. Now, the university, which was founded in 1857 and known as the mother of all universities in South India, is fighting for survival. Paying salaries every month amounts to a minor miracle; the institution has been reduced to dipping into the Rs16crore endowment fund, which is meant for lectures and prizes. How did things come to such a pass? The reasons are many. They include failure to rope in quality faculty, inability to curate relevant research programmes, falling admissions in revenue-earner distance education, and squandering resources on new buildings when revenues are falling. Vacancies among teaching staff are at 58%. As a result, some departments identified as centres for advanced studies are set to lose funding. Departments of pathology, pharmacology and environmental toxicology have suspended PG courses for lack of faculty. With no recruitment for seven years and senior professors retiring, the institution is slipping on the research front once one of its core strengths. “Faculty with international experience and talented research are not able to enter into the university. The post-doctoral research system was not strengthened. International universities thrive on post-doctoral fellows,” said professor SP Thyagarajan, former vicechancellor of Madras University. While working as a professor at the university, he came up with the drug viroherb for the treatment of Hepatitis B, which was patented in 2001. “Unless you generate high level funding through quality research proposals you can’t do any breakthrough research. The research and innovation ecosystem in the university has been deteriorating for the last 10 to 15 years,” he added. A syndicate member said the university will become financially healthy only if the government takes up the pension liability and gives out salary grants on a monthly basis instead of giving it after a delay of two to three years. Pressing for a bail-out package, a senior professor said that university cannot burden the students to solve its financial crisis. “The state government needs to give at least 50% of the budget as a grant to the university,” he added. G Shanmugam, former registrar of Madras University, said the huge faculty vacancies will affect the NAAC rating and NIRF ranking. “Three departments --botany, crystallography and biophysics and mathematics – have been recognized as centres of advanced study by UGC. Due to the shortage of faculty, these three centres on the verge of losing their status,” he said. If the government can financially bail out Annamalai University, which violated rules in faculty appointments and collapsed because of financial irregularities, why is it neglecting the University of Madras, he asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/madras-university-struggling-with-only-42-teaching-staff-diminishing-revenues/articleshow/81742656.cms||A Ragu Raman

---||Delhi||Delhi: 43% of cases down south, officials focus on clusters||NEW DELHI: While the capital is witnessing a surge of Covid-19 cases for the last two weeks, the rise is significantly higher in upscale localities at present going by the number of active Covid cases. The number of active cases hugely varies across the 11 revenue districts of the capital with four districts having more than 700 cases each, while five districts have less than 350 active cases each. The highest number of active cases at present is in the south district, where the number was 902 till Friday, according to the data available with TOI . Sources said the number is inching towards the 1,000-mark now. While the district with second-highest number of active cases is north west, with the figure being 844, the next two districts in the top four category are both situated close to the south district – south east and south west. In fact, when combined, the active cases in south, south east and south west districts account for 43% of all active cases in Delhi, out of the 11 districts. “Now we are mainly getting more Covid-19 cases from the upscale residential areas such as Safdarjung Enclave, Sainik Farms, Pushpanjali, Malviya Nagar, Pushp Vihar, etc,” a south district official said on condition of anonymity, adding that testing and tracing has gone up hugely to contain the spread. “There are 727 active cases in the south east district and 78.3% of the cases are inside containment zones. The high case load now is in upscale areas such as Greater Kailash-II, Chittaranjan Park, Lajpat Nagar, Jungpura etc.,” said Vishwendra, district magistrate (south east). “All these cases are family cases and not like clusters. There are usually two to three cases and we are just containing the houses and increasing surveillance. We are now containing every case,” he said. Surveillance, however, has been increased ‘tremendously’ and healthcare workers are going to each house, he said. “We are trying to effectively contain the active cases,” he said. “The uptick is primarily due to lack of Covid appropriate behaviour and that is why, we have increased challans, which have gone up 10 times from 37 to 373,” he said, adding that awareness campaigns are being carried out extensively, including by the enforcement teams. He, however, said that the increase is not due to increase in testing only as the district has been continuously carrying out 4,200 RT-PCRT tests every day, apart from around 2,000 rapid antigen tests. Officials said that apart from increased testing and tracing, district authorities are particularly focusing on clusters from where cases are being reported regularly and also the more than 120 municipal wards that had revealed less than 50% sero prevalence in the fifth serological survey conducted in January this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-43-of-cases-down-south-officials-focus-on-clusters/articleshow/81742689.cms||Sidharatha Roy

---||World||WHO report says animals likely source of Covid-19||BEIJING: A joint WHO-China study on the origins of Covid-19 says that transmission of the virus from bats to humans through another animal is the most likely scenario and that a lab leak is “extremely unlikely,” according to a draft copy obtained by The Associated Press. The findings were largely as expected and left many questions unanswered. The team proposed further research in every area except the lab leak hypothesis. The report’s release has been repeatedly delayed, raising questions about whether the Chinese side was trying to skew the conclusions to prevent blame for the pandemic falling on China. A World Health Organization official said late last week that he expected it would be ready for release “in the next few days.” The AP received what appeared to be a near-final version on Monday from a Geneva-based diplomat from a WHO-member country. It wasn’t clear whether the report might still be changed prior to its release. The diplomat did not want to be identified because they were not authorized to release it ahead of publication. The researchers listed four scenarios in order of likelihood. They concluded that transmission through a second animal was likely to very likely. They evaluated direct spread from bats to humans as likely, and said that spread through “cold-chain” food products was possible but not likely. The closest relative of the virus that causes COVID-19 has been found in bats, which are known to carry coronaviruses. However, the report says that “the evolutionary distance between these bat viruses and SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be several decades, suggesting a missing link.” It said that highly similar viruses have been found in pangolins, but also noted that mink and cats are susceptible to the COVID virus, which suggests they could be carriers. The report is based largely on a visit by a WHO team of international experts to Wuhan, the Chinese city where COVID-19 was first detected, from mid-January to mid-February. Peter Ben Embarek, the WHO expert who led the Wuhan mission, said Friday that the report had been finalized and was being fact-checked and translated. “I expect that in the next few days, that whole process will be completed and we will be able to release it publicly,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/who-report-says-animals-likely-source-of-covid-19/articleshow/81743158.cms||---

The victims, including two minors, were fast asleep when the fire that spread from the shop to the house took the lives of Gangubai Mole (78), her daughter-in-law Dwarka (46) and grandchildren Pallavi (15) and Krishna (10). The shop owner Anant (51), who tried to douse the blaze sustained head injuries and is undergoing treatment at the Mokhada rural hospital.

The fire originated from the shop located in the front side. The family members were sleeping inside the house located behind the shop. By the time Anant noticed the fire it had engulfed the shop and moved into the room. As the exit from the room was through the shop, the family members got stuck inside. Anant managed to pull out Bhavesh and Ashwini. The others perished in the flames. Fire brigade personnel reached the spot and managed to contain the fire within an hour.

---||World||New UAE plant to make Covid-19 vaccine from China's Sinopharm||DUBAI: A new factory in Abu Dhabi will start manufacturing a Covid-19 vaccine from Chinese pharmaceutical giant Sinopharm later this year under a joint venture between Sinopharm and Abu Dhabi-based technology company Group 42 (G42). The project is an expansion of Chinese diplomacy in the Gulf region and helps the United Arab Emirates' quest to diversify its economy away from hydrocarbon production. The plant, which is being built in the Khalifa Industrial Zone of Abu Dhabi (KIZAD), will have a production capacity of 200 million doses a year with three filling lines and five automated packaging lines, a statement from the joint venture said on Monday. The vaccine will be called Hayat-Vax when manufactured in the UAE, but is the same inactivated vaccine from the Beijing Institute of Biological Product (BiBP), a unit of Sinopharm's China National Biotec Group (CNBG), that the UAE approved for general use in December. As part of the joint venture, production of Hayat-Vax has already begun in the emirate of Ras al-Khaimah under a deal between G42 and Gulf Pharmaceutical Industries PSC, the statement said. That production line has an initial capacity of 2 million doses per month. The UAE, through G42, hosted Phase III clinical trials of the Sinopharm vaccine from July, which later expanded to other countries in the region including Bahrain. The UAE approved the vaccine for frontline workers in September before making it available to the general public in December. G42 has previously said it has distribution and manufacturing agreements with Sinopharm and hopes to provide the UAE and other states in the region with the vaccine. The deal was launched during a two-day visit to the UAE by Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi which ended on Sunday. The joint venture also includes a purpose-built research and development hub for life sciences, biotechnology and vaccine production in KIZAD. "Our joint venture is also actively looking to bring our capabilities to new markets around the world," G42 CEO Peng Xiao said. The UAE has said its trials showed the vaccine has 86% efficacy, while Sinopharm reports 79.34% efficacy based on interim results. Some people in the UAE failed to develop sufficient antibodies after a second dose of the Sinopharm vaccine and were given a third dose, the UAE health ministry said this month. It said the number was "minimal" compared to the number of vaccines administered. On Sunday, a Sinopharm executive said the company will need to assess results from overseas Phase III clinical trials to decide whether its two-shot vaccine should be followed by a booster shot. "Thanks to the close collaboration with the UAE, Sinopharm's vaccine has been now administered to millions of people in the country, the region, and the world," Sinopharm chairman Liu Jingzhen said at a virtual launch also attended by UAE foreign affairs minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/new-uae-plant-to-make-covid-19-vaccine-from-chinas-sinopharm/articleshow/81743452.cms||---

The incident occurred at Purana Qila area of the city on Saturday when 10 to 15 people stormed the temple at about 7.30pm and damaged the main door and another door at the upper storey as well as the staircase, according to a complaint made to police. Dawn newspaper reported that the security officer of the evacuee trust property board (ETPB), Northern Zone, Syed Raza Abbas Zaidi, lodged an FIR at Banni police station of Rawalpindi, saying that the construction and renovation work on the temple had been going on for the last one month. He said there were some encroachments in front of the temple which were removed on March 24. However, religious rites have not been started in the temple nor were there any idol or any other worship item. He sought legal action against the people who had caused damage to the temple and its sanctity. Earlier, the encroachment mafia had occupied the surroundings of the temple over a long time by making shops and kiosks. The district administration assisted by the police recently removed all encroachments. After the temple was cleared of encroachments, renovation work was started. Meanwhile, the administrator of the temple, Om Prakash, confirmed the incident and said that as soon as the information was received, Rawalpindi police personnel reached the spot and brought the situation under control. Prakash said that police had been deployed at his house as well as at the temple for security. He, however, said that Holi celebrations will not be held at the temple, The Express Tribune newspaper reported. Hindus form the biggest minority community in Pakistan. According to official estimates, 75 lakh Hindus live in Pakistan. Attacks on minorities are common in Pakistan.

---||World||North Korea accuses UN of double standard over missile firings||SEOUL: North Korea on Monday accused the United Nations of a “double standard” over its reaction to the North’s recent missile launches, warning it of a serious consequence. Last week, North Korea fired two short-range ballistic missiles into the sea in a defiance of UN resolutions that ban such launches by North Korea. The UN Security Council subsequently adopted a resolution to renew the mandate of UN experts monitoring sanctions against North Korea. Some experts say North Korea’s missile launches, the first of their kind in a year, were aimed at applying pressure on the new US government of President Joe Biden. “It constitutes a denial of sovereignty and an apparent double standard that the UNSC takes issue, on the basis of the UN ‘resolutions’ — direct products of the US hostile policy toward (North Korea),” senior North Korean Foreign Ministry official Jo Chol Su said in a statement carried by state media. Jo said it “doesn’t make any sense” for the UN council to take issue with only North Korea’s missile launches, while not doing anything on similar weapons tests by other countries. He said such a “double standard will invite more serious consequence” but didn’t elaborate. Observers say North Korea could test-fire longer-range missiles in coming weeks. At Friday’s meeting of the committee monitoring sanctions and North Korea, where all 15 Security Council members are represented, UN diplomats said a significant majority expressed concern at Pyongyang’s latest violations of council resolutions banning ballistic missile launches. They said the Security Council is likely to hold a closed discussion on the missile launches this week. Past short-range missile launches by North Korea typically drew UN Security Council condemnations, but not fresh sanctions on the country. North Korea was slapped with toughened UN sanctions in 2016-17 following its provocative run of missile and nuclear tests aimed at acquiring the capability of launching nuclear strikes on the US mainland.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/north-korea-accuses-un-of-double-standard-over-missile-firings/articleshow/81743787.cms||---
---||World||Merkel blames German 'perfectionism' for current virus woes||BERLIN: German Chancellor Angela Merkel has blamed her country's difficulties during the coronavirus pandemic - from the slow vaccine rollout to the back-and-forth over lockdown rules - on "a tendency toward perfectionism" and called for greater flexibility to tackle the latest surge in cases. In a lengthy television interview with public broadcaster ARD late Sunday, Merkel acknowledged that mistakes were made by her government, including on plans for an Easter lockdown. The long-time leader also expressed frustration over the actions of some of Germany's state governors, including members of her own party, who have resisted tougher restrictions they had previously agreed to. But Merkel, who is not running again in September's national election, said she stands by her pledge to offer every adult a vaccine by the end of the summer, and insisted Germany still compares well with most of its neighbors. "Perhaps we're very perfectionist at times and want to do everything right, because obviously whoever makes a mistake always faces quite a lot of public criticism," Merkel said. "But there needs to be flexibility, too," she added. "That, I believe, is an attribute that we as Germans perhaps need to learn a little bit more, alongside our tendency toward perfectionism." As an example, she cited the need for doctors and vaccine centers to have lists on hand of people who are willing to receive shots left over at the end of the day. So far, Germany has vaccinated far fewer people than Britain, the United States or Israel. With recent opinion polls showing falling support for her government, Merkel urged Germans not to become overwhelmed by despair. "We have a difficult situation," she said. "But look at our neighbors. With the exception of Denmark they are all grappling with the same problems, in part from a much more difficult position." "We also need to voice a bit of courage and strength," she said. Germany's disease control agency on Monday reported 9,872 newly confirmed cases in the past day, and 43 deaths. Since the start of the outbreak, the country of 83 million has recorded almost 2.8 million confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 75,913 deaths.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/merkel-blames-german-perfectionism-for-current-virus-woes/articleshow/81743832.cms||---

He is not alone. Unlike previous years, the number of travellers coming to Bhopal has decreased sharply due to Covid restrictions imposed in the city. Comparing previous years, the number of travelers reaching back to Bhopal to celebrate the festival has come down to almost 50%. Such is the situation that even travellers who had planned to reach Bhopal avoided travelling. A dip of around 50% witnessed in the road travels. “I live in New Delhi. The situation is not conducive in Madhya Pradesh. I can’t take any risk as my parents are old,” said Ashish. Even travellers also said that they will not join their family till the situation ends. “It is risky to meet the family members in such a situation. Already government has put several restrictions. It is better even to stay away from family for next few months instead of putting them at risk,” said Vinay Singh, a private firm employee working in Chandigarh. There are several travellers who have avoided reaching Bhopal in the fear of lockdown. “The situation is again developing when state government can announce lockdown. In such situation I do not want to witnessed the same situation again which was happened with me last year,” said Ashish Agarwal. Even those living in Bhopal have decided not to go back to their hometowns for the festival. “I am from Patna. This year I am not going there as the situation there is worse. I have dropped the plan for now. I will go to my hometown only when the situation subsides in both the states. I can’t put my family in trouble,” said Vikas Yadav, a government employee. This year the state government has appealed the citizens to celebrate Holi inside their homes due to rising Covid-19 cases across the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/no-holi-home-run-this-year-for-bhopalis-working-in-other-states/articleshow/81743995.cms||Ramendra Singh

Just like in China and Japan, the office space company’s operations in India are franchised to third parties, in this case, property developer Embassy Group. WeWork has a management agreement with Embassy as part of which the New York company gets an agreed-upon management fee. Karan Virwani, CEO of WeWork India, declined to comment on whether the agreement structure between the two entities will change or fee would remain the same post the merger. India is a major market for WeWork and is expected to turn profitable this year. It is also putting a greater focus on enterprise clients, many of whom are vacating traditional office spaces as a large chunk of its employees continue to work from home. The merger with BowX values WeWork at $9 billion, a steep drop from the $47 billion it was valued for a listing in 2019. That IPO never happened following investor concerns over its business model.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/weworks-plan-to-go-public-unlikely-to-hit-india-ops/articleshow/81744023.cms||Avik Das

Helped by summer tailwinds, domestic breweries have not only been able to stem sliding sales but have started clawing back to pre-Covid numbers. “In the east and West Bengal in particular, the beer industry is growing upwards of 50% due to a progressive change in the duty structure that has improved price accessibility for consumers,” said Kartikeya Sharma, president–India & South East Asia, AB InBev. “North and South India are expected to recover to 2019 level due to low rates of Covid infections and a favorable tax climate for beer,” he said. In Uttar Pradesh, for instance, excise duties for volume-driving 500-ml strong beer cans that account for 70% of overall beer volumes have been reduced by almost a third. “A 500-ml can of a top brand will cost Rs 110 instead of Rs 130,” said a UP-based liquor retailer. “The state has not proposed any fee increase for retail licence renewal. Wholesale and retail margins, too, have increased.” “Quarter over quarter sales have improved and December quarter was 15-20% less than the same period last year,” said a senior industry executive at one of India’s largest beer companies. “States that have waived corona cess have done better.” Similarly, in Rajasthan, one of India’s largest beer markets, duty hikes announced for Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL), coupled with the thrust behind promoting ‘Rajasthan-made liquor’ (RML), are expected to push beer sales. “Delhi has lowered the age limit for procuring and consuming alcohol. UP has come up with a personal bar permit, which will enable the residents to stock more litres in their respective houses,” said Rahul Kapur — partner at Grant Thornton Bharat. “Many states have now updated excise norms which is expected to boost alcohol consumption.” “The cut in excise duty for beer in the liquor industry in certain parts of the country is sure to give a boost to beer consumption in the respective states,” said Prabhtej Singh Bhatia, co-founder and CEO Simba Craft Beer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/beer-sales-get-boost-from-state-excise-policies/articleshow/81744050.cms||Avik Das

---||Bhopal||Exploring heritage in easy river country||The landscape looks surreal, the rocky isolation of the river valley a stark contrast to the green of the forest that skirts its edges. As far as the eye can see, there is no trace of recent human presence, the operative word being ‘recent’. The humans that came here did so thousands of years ago and they left their mark well-hidden, in the form of drawings on the cliff walls that overlook the valley. Welcome to Likhichhaj, Pahargarh, Morena! The ‘chhaj’ is a rocky ledge overlooking the valley formed by the Asan River, a tributary of the Chambal. It is one – perhaps the most significant one – of several rock shelters in this area that are home to paintings drawn by pre-historic man and those who followed his steps. Collectively, these sites can be termed the painted rock shelters of Pahargarh, which happens to be the nearest village of reasonable size. The Likhichhaj rock shelter is over a hundred feet in width and carries paintings almost throughout that space. Paintings of human figures – some dancing, some hunting, in a group, riding an elephant, carrying weapons including what looks distinctly like a shield. One painting shows a group of people walking, each carrying a stick with their belongings dangling from it, along with some arrows – travellers or men on a hunt? Another looked remarkably like a depiction of a man getting two oxen to drive a cart. All the paintings are not pre-historic. Alongside the depictions of peacocks, snakes, bulls, deer with huge antlers are geometric patterns, which resemble the yantras used in religious rituals. Most of the paintings are in red ochre, the pigment made by mixing the powdered ochre with water & animal fat, then applied using either twigs. While being every bit as fascinating as Bhimbetka, the Pahargarh painted rock shelters are characterized by a lack of detailed exploration. The Adivasi community that resides in this forested region has known about the paintings for years. Decades ago, the area was filled with legends about supernatural activities at the site – a device to keep people away. Most people did stay away – among those who didn’t were the dacoits who traversed the Chambal region. And like their ancestors in centuries past, it is believed that they too found shelter on stormy nights in the same rock shelters, soot from their fires causing some damage to the paintings. Damage has also been at the hands of more recent visitors seeking to immortalize their names alongside the paintings. Pahargarh became known to the outside world in the late 1970s with two friends leading the way - Prof DPS Dwarikesh and Shri Ram Sharma. The former was a professor of linguistics at the Western Michigan University in USA while the latter was a civil engineer from Pahargarh. Made aware of the presence of these sites, Dwarikesh led a research team to the place during a sabbatical in India, in 1978-79. He felt that the paintings may not have been mere decorations but could be taken as ideographs and thus, may even be a forerunner of written language in India. Dwarikesh’s research also provided evidence of two more things – there was enough game, fruits and vegetables in the forested area to sustain a substantial community and the presence of quantities of flint-stones, used as tools. He photographed hundreds of paintings, and believed the number could run into thousands. The dating of the paintings remains a matter of debate. While some accounts date a few paintings to be as much as 20,000 years old, others are of later periods. Likhichhaj is a veritable portal to man’s progress – and it is only one of several such shelters in this area. Unfortunately, Dwarikesh’s work could never reach a logical conclusion, stymied by India’s red-tape. But despite the years of neglect and some damage, the sheer isolation of the area has enabled the rock paintings near the Asan River to survive. As stated by noted archaeologist Erwin Neumayer in his book ‘Prehistoric Rock Art of India’, rock art flourishes with neglect, and decays with attention. This holds true of Pahargarh. May their paintings last centuries more.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/exploring-heritage-in-easy-river-country/articleshow/81744092.cms||Arjun Kumar

The deaths have sent shockwaves through the state. Among those dead are an elderly couple and their sons. Their daughter-in-law and granddaughters are also infected and in serious condition. Durg is the worst-hit district in Chhattisgarh, averaging 900 new Covid cases a day for the past few days. In the past week, as many as 5,049 patients have been detected and 38 have succumbed to the virus. According to health officials, most of those infected in Durg are travellers from Maharashtra. With the survivors in this family are critically ill, it’s not yet know how and when the elderly couple got infected but the 78-year-old man and his wife were detected Covid-positive on March 10. Their health began deteriorating rapidly from March 12 and the man died on March 16. His 70-year-old wife was on ventilator support for a week but her health kept worsening. A day after the elderly man’s death, his 51-year-old son was admitted to AIIMS-Raipur on March 17. The virus had ravaged his lungs and he died on March 21. Three days later his younger brother, who was admitted on March 15, died of Covid complications. The next day, their mother, died. Now, the 51-year-old’s wife and their two children are battling for their lives in hospital. Durg CMHO Dr GS Thakur told TOI that the date of infection of the senior citizens is not known but they had delayed getting tested, which delayed treatment, leading to fatal results. “The brothers did not have any major comorbidities. Their medical history and relevant information on Covid is yet to be ascertained,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/raipur/covid-kills-four-of-family-in-bhilai-three-in-critical-condition/articleshow/81744200.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||45+ keen on early shots? Register on the spot if app offers slots later||CHANDIGARH: The UT health department said if people above 45 years of age get a booking for a later slot on the CoWIN App for the vaccination, they can get themselves registered on the spot instead of online registration. From April 1, the vaccination against Covid-19 will commence in the country for those who are 45 years and above without any comorbidity. “Once a beneficiary is registered, any one valid photo identity card like Aadhar card, passport, driving licence, PAN card or even passbooks is required,” said Dr Amandeep Kang, director health services, UT. She said, “If the CoWIN portal shows booked slots and a beneficiary is keen to get him/her vaccinated sooner, he/she can come to any of the nearby sites with the required photo ID and get on the spot registration.” The UT health department will run all the 54 sites for the vaccination. The government sites which will be open for the common public include one site at PGI Covid-19 hospital, two sites at GMCH-32, Sector 45 civil hospital, Sector 22 civil hospital and Manimajra civil hospital, health and wellness centres at sectors 49, 23, 26, 35, 38, 27, 8 Maloya, Dhanas and Daddumajra. As there is no dearth of vaccines in the city, anyone from the previous priority group, who was registered earlier, can also come and get vaccinated. “After the sites for the fourth priority group open, the healthcare, frontline and the elderly can also come for vaccination. We will not turn anyone away as there is no paucity of vaccines,” said the DHS. The first vaccination started in the city on January 16 with the healthcare workers, the second priority was open for the frontline workers on February 3, while on March 1, those above 60 years of age and those between 45 years and 59 years of age with comorbidites were allowed for vaccination. “The government should expand the vaccination coverage irrespective of any age now. Moreover, those who are young are mostly asymptomatic and super spreaders. They should also be vaccinated soon,” said a public health expert.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/45-keen-on-early-shots-register-on-the-spot-if-app-offers-slots-later/articleshow/81744235.cms||Shimona Kanwar

As per health department, of these 1,14,805 beneficiaries, 8,472 were vaccinated in Raipur district, 4,972 in Durg district, 7,165 in Rajnandgaon, 4073 in Bilaspur, 1,691 in Sukma, 12,269 in Raigarh, 2,354 in Balod, 5,270 in Sarguja, 3,349 in Janjgir Champa, 8001 in Baloda Bazar, 4,456 in Jashpur, 3,429 in Korba, 1,240 in Bemetara, 7,116 in Dhamtari, 2,535 in Korea, 411 in Kondagaon, 1,620 in Kanker, 1,620 in Gorela Penda Marwahi, 4,279 in Mungeli, 144 in Narayanpur, 1,141 in Gariaband, 887 in Dantewada, 5,468 in Surajpur, 1080 in Balrampur, 10,158 in Mahasamund, 1,358 in Bijapur, 2,273 in Kabirdham. Meanwhile, explaining Covid vaccine’s tendency of developing immunity against the virus, health officials said any person who has received two doses of Covid vaccine will not get serious even if contracted with Covid virus. However, it takes two weeks to develop antibodies after taking second dose, added officials. Chhattisgarh health officials shared a study by Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education & Research (JIPMER) in Puducherry indicating that the chances of becoming serious is rare among those who received both doses of vaccine. Underlining the research’s outcome, health officials said that out of lakhs of people who have received vaccine shots the numbers of getting re-infected after getting both shots is in double digits. This proves that contracting infection after vaccination is very rare. The vaccine creates antibody and strengthens body’s immune system. However, health officials asserted that even after taking both doses of vaccine, people should avoid crowds as the vaccine does not provide hundred per cent safety. According to scientists, until 70 per cent of the total population develops immunity, such infection will keep happening. Therefore, eligible persons must get vaccine shots.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/raipur/covid-vaccination-cg-records-its-highest-one-day-turnout/articleshow/81744256.cms||---

The security forces also recovered substantial material, including arms and ammunition. The encounter took place in the Khobramenda forest. Substantial numbers of Maoists had assembled in the northern part of the district with sabotage plans as a part of their ongoing Tactical counter offensive campaigns (TCOC). Gadchiroli police's C-60 commandos had stepped up their counter domination exercises into the remote areas and also along the Maharashtra-Chhattishgarh-Telangana borders.
