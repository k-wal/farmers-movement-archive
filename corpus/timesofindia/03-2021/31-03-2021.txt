The survey from the Conference Board on Tuesday also showed consumers were fairly upbeat about the labor market, with a measure of household employment rebounding after three straight monthly decreases. Restrictions on non-essential businesses are being rolled back as more Americans get vaccinated against Covid-19. That, along with the White House's massive $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package, has led economists to predict the economy will experience its best performance in nearly four decades this year. The survey showed more consumers intended to buy homes, cars and household appliances over the next six months. "Consumers finally are fully on board with the pending expansion," said Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia. "What remains to be seen is how quickly services industries such as travel and leisure will open up, allowing venues for consumers to release their pent-up demand." The Conference Board's consumer confidence index jumped 19.3 points to a reading of 109.7 this month, the highest level since the onset of the pandemic in March 2020. The increase was the largest since April 2003. Confidence remains well below its lofty reading of 132.6 in February 2020. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index would rise to 96.9. The survey's present situation measure, based on consumers' assessment of current business and labor market conditions, soared to a reading of 110.0 from 89.6 last month. The expectations index, based on consumers' short-term outlook for income, business and labor market conditions jumped to 109.6, the highest in nearly two years, from February's reading of 90.9. Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. Prices of shorter-dated US Treasuries were down. Inflation worriesThe survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, rebounded to a reading of 7.8 this month from -0.8 in February. That was the highest reading in a year. The measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the labor department's closely-watched employment report. The rise fits in with expectations for a sharp acceleration in job growth this month. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 650,000 jobs in March after rising by 379,000 in February. The government is due to publish March's employment report on Friday. "Recently, anxiety over jobs has fallen, allowing the consumer to breathe easier," said Scott Murray, financial markets economist at Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio. "The recovery engine is gathering steam, moving towards a better future." The relief package passed this month is sending additional $1,400 checks to qualified households and extending the government safety net for the unemployed through September 6. First-quarter gross domestic product estimates are as high as a 10.0% annualised rate. The economy grew at a 4.3% pace in the fourth quarter. Growth this year could top 7%, which would be the fastest since 1984. The economy contracted 3.5% in 2020, the worst performance in 74 years. The Conference Board survey showed the share of consumers expecting an increase in income over the next six months rose to 15.5% from 14.8% in February. But the proportion anticipating a drop increased to 13.3% from 12.9% last month. That could be because most government subsidies, which have boosted income for lower-income households, will start running out after the summer. More consumers expected to purchase homes, motor vehicles and major household appliances compared to February. Consumers' inflation expectations over the next 12 months increased to 6.7%, the highest since March 2011, from 6.5% in February. "It appears that rapidly rising gasoline prices are starting to dampen confidence," said Lydia Boussour, lead US economist at Oxford Economics in New York. "While consumer spending growth is poised for a historic acceleration this year, the expected rise in inflation will act as a restraint." The jump in house-buying intentions suggests demand for homes could remain strong and continue to drive up prices as supply remains tight. The housing market is being powered by demand for more spacious accommodations for home offices and schooling. It remains strong even as the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has risen to a nine-month high of 3.17%. A separate report on Tuesday showed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller house price index soared 11.2% in January from a year ago, the fastest in 15 years, after rising 10.4% in December. Robust house price inflation was confirmed by a third report showing the Federal Housing Finance Agency house price index shot up 12% on a year-on-year basis in January after increasing 11.4% in December. "A wave of eager buyers is being forced to act swiftly and face heightened competition for the few homes available," said Matthew Speakman, an economist at Zillow. "The combined dynamic is pushing prices upward at their strongest pace in years, and it doesn't appear that there is an end in sight."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/us-consumer-confidence-hits-one-year-high-house-prices-soar/articleshow/81766755.cms||---
---||Business||IMF sees global economy improving despite uncertainties||WASHINGTON: Economic growth led by the United States and China is accelerating, amplifying the risks of an uneven global recovery, the head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said on Tuesday. "In January we projected global growth at 5.5 percent in 2021," said IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva in an address ahead of the body's annual spring meeting cohosted with the World Bank. "We now expect a further acceleration," she said ahead of the international organization's official update of its forecast in a week. Key factors in the improved outlook includes the US passage of President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion economic relief package and an expected bounce from coronavirus vaccines increasingly available in larger economies, Georgieva said. She also praised the "extraordinary effort" of workers throughout the health care universe, including doctors, nurses and vaccine scientists. Governments played a key role in averting a worldwide depression, Georgieva said, with some $16 trillion in fiscal support and a "massive liquidity injection by central banks" averting complete disaster. Without these steps, the worldwide economic contraction of 3.5 per cent in 2020 "would have been at least three times worse," she said. But the IMF is seeing increasing signs of a "multi-speed recovery" powered by the United States and China, which are on track to enjoy growth by the end of 2021 that outpaces their pre-crisis performance. In general, the global outlook remains clouded by "extremely high uncertainty," with economic activity still tied closely to the pandemic. "So much depends on the path of the pandemic -- which is now shaped by uneven progress in vaccination and the new virus strains that are holding back growth prospects, especially in Europe and Latin America," she said. European nations, however, are on a "sound recovery path" and can expect their pandemic-battered economies to bounce back in the second half of 2021, boosted by stepped-up vaccination drives. The IMF expects European countries will recover "a quarter later" than the United States. Especially vulnerable are emerging markets with more "fragile" government. "Many are highly exposed to hard-hit sectors, such as tourism," she said. "Now they face less access to vaccines and even less room in their budgets." A keen worry in a global economy fractured by different-paced recoveries would be a sudden rise in US growth that leads to a jump in interest rates and capital flight from emerging regions. But Georgieva brushed aside concerns about potentially uncontrolled inflation in the United States due to massive stimulus packages, estimating that inflation should be around 2.25 per cent in 2022. "Not something to be scared of," she said. "We expect inflation to remain contained, but faster US recovery could cause a rapid rise in interest rates, which could lead to a sharp tightening of financial conditions -- and significant capital outflows from emerging and developing economies." Georgieva urges generous investment in the production and distribution of vaccines to facilitate the transition to the post-Covid economy. She also backs increased investment for the most vulnerable countries, as well as spending on infrastructure, health and education so that "everyone can benefit from the historic transformation to greener and smarter economies." This group of nations requires $200 billion over five years to overcome the pandemic and another $250 billion to return to a trajectory of meeting richer countries, said Georgieva, citing a recent IMF study. The IMF has already provided $107 billion in financing and debt service relief for the 29 nation poorest nations. This includes support for sub-Saharan Africa at about 13 times the level previously. Support within the international organization is also building for lending some $650 billion in special drawing rights to aid the most vulnerable nations, she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/imf-sees-global-economy-improving-despite-uncertainties/articleshow/81766827.cms||---

---||India||Another senior politician quits PDP||JAMMU: In yet another jolt to former J&K chief minister Mehbooba Mufti-led People’s Democratic Party (PDP), its senior leader and ex-MLC Surinder Choudhary resigned from the basic membership of the party on Tuesday, alleging that the party has been hijacked by a coterie comprising drawing-room politicians, land-grabbers and the mafia. Earlier on March 17, former J&K deputy CM Muzaffar Hussain Baig had quit PDP. District Development Council member from Nowshera Dr Manohar Singh, Block Development Council chairman Bodh Raj, 16 sarpanches, 70 panches, three councillors and many office-bearers of zone committees also resigned from the party with Choudhary. Addressing a press conference here, Choudhary claimed that PDP president Mehbooba was under the influence of some functionaries and was unable to distinguish between right and wrong, and had deviated from the core agenda of “peace with dignity” as envisaged by party founder Mufti Mohammad Sayeed. “We have been forced to take this step because PDP has been hijacked by some drawing-room politicians, land-grabbers, and land mafia, who have gathered around her (Mehbooba),” he said. Choudhary had already resigned from the post of PDP general secretary and its political affairs committee on March 17 after the reorganisation of the party by Mehbooba soon after being re-elected party president. He said, “Mufti Mohammad Sayeed’s regime was the golden era in the history of J&K, which paved the way for the revival of business, tourism and even cross-border routes, benefiting the public. His vision was even supported by former Prime Minister AB Vajpayee.” He added: “Unfortunately, within four years of the demise of Mufti Sahib, PDP is facing an existential crisis as all senior leaders have quit the party. Mehbooba never bothered to ask leaders why they were leaving the party. I resigned from the two posts but she did not try to reach out to me,” Choudhary said. Underlining that nobody pressured him to leave the party, he claimed that a false narrative was being created within the party that most of the functionaries were quitting due to pressure from central agencies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/another-senior-politician-quits-pdp/articleshow/81767167.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

Raipur’s cycling enthusiasts are beating the summer heat by taking up night cycling to indulge in biking and at the same having fun outdoors. We trace this new trend in the city… Beating the heatThe maddening heat of Raipur has made summer battered souls take up cycling in the evening or late in the night when the climate is relatively cooler. A city-based professor Dr Amit Verma rides only in the night because of the summers as morning rides can lead to heatstroke easily considering how the temperatures have swelled up, “I just can’t ride in the scorching heat, so cycling in the evening hours is a better option for me. I ride from Ghadi Chowk to Naya Raipur every week which are all green and breezy areas and they are less crowded at night.” He goes on to add, “Now that the mercury level has begun to soar, I make sure that I wear white tees and sweat-proof clothes while cycling.” Keeping stress at bayThere are others who feel night biking facilitates good sleep after a hectic day. Feeling the same, Devendra Kumar who is pursuing his LLB from Hidayatullah National Law University, has embraced night cycling recently. He shares, “I prefer pedalling late in the night around 11 pm for almost two hours every day. Post this, I resume studies with a fresh mind and most importantly I get a good sleep.” As the trend of night cycling is rapidly catching up, one can see many cyclists in the city donning reflective vests and adding accessories to the bicycles which help them ride comfortably in dimly lit areas. Rohit Jain MBA student says, “Raipur has quite a few salad and juice points at night and while cycling with my group of friends, we stop by to have green juice that are good for the system.” Adventure specialist Sanjeet Sharma who organises night cycling treks in and around the city, opines, “As the summer season peaks, the trend of night cycling treks also rises stupendously. A lot of cycling enthusiasts start in the evening and ride in a group to cherry farms located in the range of 20 km radius. Many times, they camp out near the lakes, heritage or spiritual sites and return the next morning. Budda Talab, Katora Lake is some of the favourite destinations of night cyclists.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/raipur/raipurians-take-up-night-cycling-to-beat-the-scorching-heat/articleshow/68830583.cms||---
---||India||Railway coaches to be 100% Made in India by 2022 end||NEW DELHI: The railway ministry has set the December 2022 target to achieve 100% indigenous manufacturing of all rail coaches by ending dependence on imports from countries, including China. Currently the Linke Hofmann Busch (LHB) coaches, being manufactured by Indian Railways’ production unit - Integral Coach Factory, Rail Coach Factory and Modern Coach Factory - are completely indigenous except for the wheels and axles. At present, wheel discs and semi-finished axles are imported from China for the LHB coaches. Sources said in recent years the Indian Railways’ import component of manufacturing parts have reduced steadily and now it’s around 1.6% of total value of items. They said efforts have been undertaken to reduce this share of imports further and some of the last few remaining items like wheels and axles are now going to be fully manufactured in India. In 2020-21, Indian Railways imported 60,000 LHB wheels, which is a 100% annual requirement of LHB wheels by the railways. About 4,000 axles, which constitute around 18% of Indian Railways annual requirement, were imported. The LHB coaches use forged wheels. Axles of all the rolling stock are forged and wheels were imported because they were not manufactured here and axles were imported because of capacity constraints. “Steps have been taken to indigenize forged wheel manufacturing through SAIL, Durgapur and Forged Wheel Plant of RINL being set up at Raebareli. Indian Railways have entered into an assured off-take contract with the Forged Wheel Plant of RINL for 80,000 wheels per annum that encouraged them to set up this plant. It is scheduled for commissioning shortly,” said an official. SAIL, Durgapur, which was primarily manufacturing wheels for locomotives, has started manufacturing LHB wheels too, the official said. “They have manufactured and delivered about 400 wheels that are on trial. It has a capacity to manufacture about 60,000 forged wheels of all types. Thus, with these steps a capacity of 1.1 lakh LHB wheels shall be available in India and this will be more than the annual requirement of LHB coaches,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/railway-coaches-to-be-100-made-in-india-by-2022-end/articleshow/81768484.cms||Dipak K Dash

Sources told TOI that the poll panel will be sending the reference seeking CBI probe to DoPT, the administrative ministry for the Central investigation agency, by Wednesday. “Since the alleged bribery relates to elections and has happened during the period when model code of conduct is in force, EC is competent to seek a CBI probe. Earlier, after raids carried out in Madhya Pradesh during 2019 Lok Sabha polls led to huge recoveries of unaccounted cash, EC had sought a CBI probe on similar lines,” said a senior functionary. Meanwhile, EC, based on preliminary reports and inputs that found “serious dereliction of duty by some police officials” in connection with the Tiruchi West case, on Tuesday ordered the transfer of IGP, Commissioner of Police, Tiruchirappalli J Loganathan to a non-election related post as well as the suspension of ACP, Golden Rock Range, Law and Order, Thiru Tamilmaran. On Saturday evening, acting on information that bribe was being given to law enforcers ahead of the polls, special teams headed by senior officers in the rank of an Assistant Commissioner of Police conducted checks at the Government Hospital police station and at the Thillai Nagar police station and found several covers containing cash amounting to thousands of rupees. Both the police stations fall in Tiruchi West constituency from where Nehru is seeking a re-election. A case against the police personnel was registered by the City Crime Branch on a complaint lodged by a senior police officer in the rank of an Assistant Commissioner of Police under IPC section 171 (e) (bribery) and under section 129 (3) of The Representation of People Act. Six police personnel were suspended in connection with the incident including an Inspector of Police of Thillai Nagar station; a Sub Inspector of Government Hospital police station, a Special Sub Inspector of Government Hospital police station and a Woman Head Constable attached to Thillai Nagar police station besides two other personnel serving in the City Intelligence Section tasked with looking after Government Hospital police station and Thillai Nagar police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/tamil-nadu/ec-to-ask-dopt-to-launch-cbi-probe-into-dmk-candidates-bribery-allegations/articleshow/81769404.cms||Bharti Jain

German company Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement (BSM), which manages the Panama-registered Japanese shipping company Shoei Kisen Kaisha-owned 400-metre-long cargo vessel, said, “They (crew) are safe and in good health... Their hard work and tireless professionalism are greatly appreciated.” Directorate general of shipping Amitabh Kumar told TOI, “As there is no harm to the Indian crew, there is no reason for us to intervene right now. As per the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), any vessel that has met with an accident has to be investigated as per its convention. This is called ‘casualty investigation’. The same will be conducted on this vessel. It will be a fact-finding inquiry. The report is normally submitted by the flag state. If we receive any complaint from the company that the inquiry is not impartial, then of course we will intervene. But so far we have not received any such complaint.” Talking to TOI, Abhijeet Sangle, working president of the All India Seafarers and General Workers Union, said the “BSM, which has its branch in Andheri (Mumbai), informed us that of the 25 crew members, three are from Mumbai, some are from Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and some from north India. However, the company did not disclose the names of the captain or other crew for security reasons.” He said, “The company told us that a full inspection of the ship, including its hull and engine, and its cargo is currently on. If the ship is found fit, then the vessel with the same crew will move to its next destination to Rotterdam without any further delay.” The company, with help from the canal authority, will then scan the digital video recorder (DVR) of the ship passage through the Suez canal and check what led to the accident that day, he said. “They will find out who’s at fault; the ship captain or the canal pilot, who helped steer the big vessel through the narrow canal. As per rules, if a captain is held liable, he or she, the duty officer in charge and the respective able seamen will be signed off and may not be enrolled again. But it’s too early to say anything,” the union president said. With the Suez Canal open, over 422 vessels stranded on both sides of the 193-km strategic passage till Tuesday will now be cleared in the next few days. The shipping industry is crucial to the existence of the global economy as about 90% of the world's food, fuel, raw materials and manufactured goods are delivered by sea. India contributes a significant chunk of sea-farers to the shipping industry as the country is recognised globally as a reliable source of marine manpower. The DG (shipping) told TOI, “On an average, India sends around 2.4 lakh sea-farers every year. Of them, 2.1 lakh sea-farers work on foreign ships and 30,000 on Indian ships.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/suez-canal-25-indian-crew-of-refloated-vessel-in-good-health-will-sail-to-europe-if-ship-fit/articleshow/81769634.cms||Surendra Singh

While several independent cybersecurity researchers have been reporting about a likely data breach of MobiKwik's servers as early as February, French security researcher Robert Baptiste (Elliot Alderson on Twitter) confirmed the hack on Monday. The breach includes names, email addresses, list of installedapps, location data, hashed passwords, and partially-masked credit card numbers and photos of KYC documents. MobiKwik denies breach, says it will do forensic auditWhile MobiKwik denied any data breach on Tuesday, it however said in a blogpost: “The company is closely working with requisite authorities, and is confident that security protocols to store sensitive data are robust and have not been breached. Considering the seriousness of the allegations, and by way of abundant caution, it will get a third party to conduct a forensic data security audit.” It said, “When this matter was first reported last month, the company undertook a thorough investigation with the help of external security experts and did not find any evidence of a breach.” “Some users have reported that their data is visible on the dark web. While we are investigating this, it is entirely possible that any user could have uploaded her/ his information on multiple platforms,” it added. However users, who claimed they had searched through the leaked data on a site, said they were able to find personal details uniquely saved on MobiKwik in it, tying the breach to the platform. “Some of my data is there. In fact even the accurate date for the creation of my Mobikwik account, in 2013, is there,” Nikhil Pahwa tweeted on Tuesday. MobiKwik also received flak from Twitter users for shifting blame. Cybersecurity researcher Rajshekhar Rajaharia, who first made public the breach on February 26, told TOI he had written to MobiKwik about the breach on February 24, and also communicated to RBI and CERT-in later in the first week of March but had not heard back. Both correspondences were seen by TOI. “This was likely a breach of their server and users should change their passwords on all websites immediately,” Rajaharia said. As per Rajaharia, a dark web forum originally advertised the data in February. Rajaharia claims that once he warned MobiKwik over email, the firm must have taken measures to stop the hacker from downloading the data as the hacker then posted saying they lost access to the servers. But, again on March 27, the hackers claimed that they had recovered all data and put it up for sale for 1.5 bitcoin (roughly $86,000).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/security-breach-8-2tb-data-up-for-sale-on-dark-web/articleshow/81769741.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

Arguing that the Union government’s decision to privatise VSP is in violation of constitutional right of people who gave away their land for the plant, he also requested the court to call for records on feasibilities and proposals on allotting captive mines which will reduce 50 per cent of manufacturing costs of the plant. Lakshminarayana further said in his petition that thousands of farmers gave away their lands at a meagre price for the plant after the government promised them jobs and gave them rehabilitation cards. But even after 40 years of the establishment of the plant, 7,624 families are yet to be provided jobs, he alleged, adding that if VSP is privatised, it would deprive them of their rightful rehabilitation promised by the Union government. He said the notional losses reflecting on RINL’s balance sheet are mainly due to non-allocation of captive mines. He further said the value of land in the balance sheet is shown as Rs 55 crore, when its current market price is over Rs 60,000 crore. The high court is likely to hear the petition on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/vvl-files-pil-against-privatisation-of-vsp/articleshow/81765685.cms||Srikanth Aluri

"Loading 2 million tonne goods in the Covid-19 pandemic period was an uphill task for the division. However, railway officials and staff gave their best to make it a revenue generating division from freight loading as well,” Danapur divisional railway manager (DRM) Sunil Kumar said on Friday. He added: “When the actual loading started at Seikhpura, Fatuha, Wena, Chakand and other goods terminal loading centres in the division, consignors cooperated with the railways and availed facilities which remained open for loadings. Railways made no delay in dispatching the booked consignments to their respective destinations.” The DRM claimed the mainstay of Danapur division has been a record earning from passengers. “Patna Junction and Rajendra Nagar Terminal have the footfall of passengers in lakhs per day, yielding an impressive revenue for the railways. It is a matter of joy that it has become both passenger and freight loading oriented division, which achieved this feat on Thursday, when it touched 2 million tonne goods loading figure in the 2020-21 fiscal,” he said. “To mark the celebration of this rare feat, the DRM visited the Danapur control room personally and congratulated each staff member of the control room and commercial department for showing utmost sincerity to duty and bringing laurels to the division,” said senior divisional commercial manager of Danapur Adhar Raj. Additional DRMs Vhibhuti Bushan (operation) and Mahesh Kumar Roy (infrastructure) were also present in the control room along with other branch officers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/danapur-div-exceeds-goods-loading-target/articleshow/81765989.cms||Kumod Verma

Local residents admitted the injured persons to private clinics and late on Sunday night four of them were referred to Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH). Three of the deceased, identified as Parduman Kumar, Kaushal Kishore Prasad and Kailu Prasad were residents of Telhara, while three others identified as Dhirendra Kumar, Ujjawal Kumar and Suryabhan Kumar hailed from different villages under the Ghosi police station area of neighbouring Jehanabad district. Hilsa sub-ivisional police officer Krishna Murari said the incident took place after the driver of the speeding truck coming from neighbouring Jehanabad district lost control over his vehicle. Driver of the vehicle and other occupants later fled from the spot. Angry over the accident, local residents first damaged the truck and later set it on fire. Police personnel were pelted with stones when they tried to remove the bodies and prevent them from setting the truck on fire. At least five policemen, including SI Sidheshwar Ram sustained injuries, who were later admitted to Telhara primary health centre (PHC). The rampaging crowd also attacked the Telhara police station and set five police vehicles on fire. The agitators were finally pacified around 9pm when Nalanda DM Yogendra Kumar Singh and SP Hari Prasath S reached the spot with heavy police contingent and assured them of providing best medical treatment to the injured. The DM, at the instruction of chief minister Nitish Kumar handed ex-gratia of Rs 4 lakh to the kin of each deceased person. Governor Phagu Chauhan and CM Nitish have expressed their grief over the tragic incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/six-killed-7-hurt-in-nalanda-as-truck-rams-into-shops/articleshow/81765881.cms||---

FC Goa became the first Indian club to qualify for the AFC Champions League when they topped the league stage of the Indian Super League (ISL) last season. The ACL is Asian football’s top-tier club competition. The group E games will kick off in Goa on April 14. Goa have been drawn alongside last year’s runnersup Persepolis, Qatar Stars League side Al-Rayyan and the winner of the playoff between Al-Wahda (UAE) and Al-Zawraa (Iraq). But while fans are eagerly waiting to see the team in action, the local organisers have decided to play the matches behind closed doors. “With rising Covid-19 cases in Goa, it just does not make sense to allow fans,” a senior AIFF official told TOI on Wednesday. “Even India’s cricket games (against England) were played without fans. For IPL too there won’t be fans. At the moment, there is too much of a risk to get fans inside. We have to ensure that we host the league stage without any complications.” Goa reported its highest daily Covid-19 case count in five months after it saw 200 fresh infections on Wednesday. The spike from 60-odd daily cases in the first week of March to more than twice that number now has alarmed everyone. Goa’s positivity rate is also among the country’s highest with 8.5% as against the national average of 5%. Meanwhile, Persepolis FC will open their campaign against the playoff winners at 5.30pm on April 14 while Goa have been drawn to take on the might of Qatar’s Al Rayyan SC in the second game at 8.30pm. All games will be played at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda, unless matches are to be played simultaneously on the final match day. The GMC Athletic Stadium in Bambolim is the second venue. According to fixtures released on the AFC website, Goa play five of their six matches at 8.30pm while only the clash against playoff winners has been slotted for 5pm kick off on April 17. Goa have time till April 7 to finalise their squad for the group stage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/afc-champions-league-behind-closed-doors-in-goa/articleshow/81787933.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

However, the numbers plummeted on Tuesday. The state witnessed a whopping 351 fresh cases on Sunday when Holika Dahan was observed. It was perhaps the highest single-day caseload reported in Bihar in the past three months. Also, this happened to be the day when a large number of people working in other states returned home to celebrate Holi the next day. The cases came down on Holi when it stood at 239 on Monday. Patna witnessed the highest number of cases on both days as it stood at 129 and 106 respectively. Given the possibility of a surge during Holi, the state government had issued an order on Saturday not allowing public gatherings or any events on Holika Dahan. Nevertheless, the curve went sharply downwards on Tuesday with just 74 Covid-19 positive cases reported in the past 24 hours. Patna again continued to get the highest number of cases as the corresponding figure stood at 74. Also, there was no significant rise in death due to Covid-19 during the festival, as just one death was reported per day over the past three days. The same trend was seen over the past two months. The overall death toll due to Covid-19 in the state so far stands at 1,574. Meanwhile, altogether 105 people recovered from infection in the past 24 hours, taking the tally to 2,62, 238. With new cases and discharged patients, Bihar’s recovery rate improved to 98.86% as of Tuesday evening, which was 4.68 % higher than the national average of 94.18%. Altogether 67,957 beneficiaries got the Covid-19 vaccines on Tuesday, which included the first and the second dose. While 65,942 beneficiaries got their first dose, 2,015 got their second dose. As of date, altogether 27,02,363 people have taken both the doses, including Covishield and Covaxin. Of the 22,72,691 people who have taken the first dose, 13,58,678 are people above 60 and the remaining 2,11,401 are people in the age group of 45-59 with co-morbidities. Moreover, 4,29,672 people have taken the second dose of the vaccine as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/steep-rise-in-covid-cases-in-bihar-during-holi-number-falls-next-day/articleshow/81766337.cms||Piyush Tripathi

Smooth vaccine rollout in the US that led to new highs for some of the leading indices on Wall Street on Monday, despite rising infection numbers in India, led to strong buying on Dalal Street. The day’s four-digit gain was the biggest single-session surge for the sensex in over two months. The rally was also helped by short covering by speculators who rushed to cut their losses after the initial gains in the index. On the NSE, the Nifty closed 338 points or 2.3% higher at 14,845 points. Analysts feel the trend for domestic markets could be upwards in the medium term. According to Rusmik Oza of Kotak Securities, two factors could act in India’s favour and help domestic equities outperform its peers in the emerging markets. Except for Tuesday’s depreciation, the rupee has remained quite steady even though the dollar index has risen. Also when the US 10-year bond yield has spiked sharply, India’s 10-year bond yield has remained quite stable. “The recent correction could be due to rising Covid cases and year-end phenomenon wherein retail and HNI (high networth individual) investors would have avoided taking any fresh positions. The start of new settlement for fiscal year 2022 and the forthcoming earnings seasons could be the reasons for fresh investor interest in stocks,” Oza said. In the short term, in addition to the domestic factors, market players are keeping a close watch on global factors like US President Joe Biden’s tax plans, the rising US 10-year yield and the vaccine rollout in the world’s biggest economy. Technically too, the indices have some hurdles to cross. According to Abhishek Chinchalkar, head of education, Fyers Securities, for the Nifty last week’s high of 14,878 is the immediate hurdle. “If the index surpasses this level, the recovery could extend towards 14,985-15,060 points. Meanwhile, (Tuesday’s) low of 14,617 now becomes the immediate support to watch out for, a break below which is likely to resume the downside pressure on the index,” Chinchalkar, a technical analyst, said in a post-market note. In Tuesday’s session, of the 30 sensex stocks, 27 closed with gains. In the broader market, however, the advance-decline ratio was more moderated. There were 1,518 stocks that closed higher compared to 1,433 scrips which closed lower. As a result, investors were richer by Rs 3.5 lakh crore with BSE’s market capitalisation now at Rs 206.7 lakh crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sensex-soars-1128-pts-over-earnings-us-vaccine-rollout/articleshow/81767765.cms||---

Although the bank said that it was an “intermittent issue” faced by a section of customers in the morning, some of them said that even at 6pm they could not get access to lender’s online services. The latest glitch in providing online access comes at a time when HDFC Bank is expected to get back to the banking regulator on how it has addressed recurrent issues on its digital banking platform. In December 2020, the RBI had barred HDFC Bank from new digital launches and issuance of fresh credit cards until it addressed its digital issues. The RBI had also asked the bank’s board to identify lapses and fix accountability. The RBI’s directive came after a prolonged outage of digital services following a power outage at the bank’s primary data centre. Incidentally, HDFC bank had told investors that it should be able to address the regulator’s concerns in a few months. The fresh outage could raise fresh concerns for the RBI. Sources said that prima facie customers faced service outage and this was not a planned downtime and the central bank would seek more information. According to sources, Monday’s outage was due to the bank losing connectivity to data centres. The bank had responded to customer complaints on social media with a standard statement that “some customers are facing intermittent issues accessing our net banking/mobile banking app. We are looking into it on priority for resolution. We apologise for the inconvenience and request you to try again after some time”. Tuesday’s outage hit customers hard as it came on the penultimate day of the financial year and after a long weekend. Several customers complained about their inability to pay their credit card bills. Some customers said that branch visit was not an option as in salary accounts, the home branch is usually close to their office and with most people working from home, the “home” branch is out of reach for them. Besides internet and mobile banking, customers complained about not being able to access their funds through unified payments interface (UPI) apps as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/digital-outage-hits-hdfc-bank-customers-again/articleshow/81767860.cms||---

The state government has lined up several infrastructure projects for the long-term needs of Vizag city, including a separate water pipeline from the Godavari, Vizag metro rail project, a six-lane coastal highway from Bheemili to Bhogapuram, Bhogapuram airport, beachfront development, etc. As per the AP Decentralisation and Inclusive Development of All Regions Bill, 2020, the development area of Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Region Development Authority (VMRDA) will be termed the executive capital.  The development area of the VMRDA has been recently increased to 7,300 square kilometres by bringing 13 rural mandals under the jurisdiction of the VMRDA. These developments assume prominence amid speculations over the executive capital soon shifting to Vizag. It may be recalled that the three capital cities plan was announced at least 14 months ago. Apart from the proposed state guest house on 30 acres in Kapuluppada, the Andhra Pradesh Industrial Infrastructure Corporation has recently called for tenders to develop an industry enablement centre, a transit guest house and residential towers on about 10 acres in Madhurawada hill number four. As per Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) officials, the responsibility of preparing a detailed project report (DPR) for the Godavari pipeline project has been recently handed over to the Water and Power Consultancy Services Limited, a public sector undertaking under the Union ministry of Jal Shakti, after a delay on the part of the first agency appointed for the job. “The DPR would cost about Rs 1.8 crore and would be completed in the next one month,” said a GVMC official.  But contrary to the earlier proposal of laying a pipeline from Polavaram (180 kilometres), the DPR is currently being prepared for only 130 kilometres (Yeleru to Visakhapatnam). The civic body is hopeful of getting about 50% funding for the pipeline under the Jal Shakti Abhiyan scheme as the project covers rural parts in Visakhapatnam and East Godavari districts. Meanwhile, the state government has asked officials to prepare the best designs for Vizag metro rail project during a recent review meet conducted in Amaravati. It was learnt that the final DPR for the metro part of the project would be completed in the next one to two weeks. GVMC and VMRDA are also bracing for the shift of the executive capital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/infra-boost-lined-up-for-vizag-city-amid-talk-of-capital-shift/articleshow/81765675.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Patna||Bihar: Two killed, two shot at as kids’ fight leads to clashes on Holi||PATNA: Two persons, including a 14-year-old boy, were killed and two others critically injured amid indiscriminate firing by two groups over a petty dispute between minors playing Holi at a village in western Patna late Monday night. The deceased, Manish Kumar Yadav (14) and Rajkumar Yadav (24), were from Murarchak village in Jamsaut panchayat under the Shahpur police station area. While Rajkumar had bullet injuries, Manish received several deep wounds likely from a blunt object. The two critically injured, Munna Kumar and Sujeet Kumar, have received bullet injuries. They are undergoing treatment at a private hospital near Saguna Mor in Danapur. Sujeet’s condition is stated to be critical. Jamsaut panchayat mukhiya Rajendra Bellar told TOI over the phone on Tuesday that there was an old dispute between the two groups of Mathiyapur village. "They capitalized on the minors’ dispute on playing colours to settle scores," he said. Bellar, quoting villagers, said after the dispute between the two minors everything had become normal. "But their fathers Munna Yadav and Pappu Yadav got into arguments later in the night which escalated into a scuffle. Thereafter, several rounds were fired by both sides at each other," Bellar said. The mukhiya said Rajkumar had reached the spot to intervene but was instead shot dead. "Manish had no role in the dispute. He was carrying food for his mother. Probably those firing at the spot didn’t want to get their identities revealed due to which they killed him too," he said. The mukhiya said Manish’s home was recently constructed under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana hardly a few paces away from the spot where the killings took place. "I visited the spot on Tuesday morning. Everyone had fled their homes either because they were involved or out of fear," he said. Shahpur police station SHO Dheeraj Kumar said no arrests have been made yet. "Several rounds were fired between the two sides during the clash. But no empty cartridges were recovered from the spot," he said. SHO Kumar said the deceased Manish and Rajkumar were linked to one side of the warring groups while the injured two are associated with the other group. "Manish’s post-mortem was conducted at the Patna Medical College and Hospital. Doctors said there was no bullet injury on his body. Rajkumar’s post-mortem was conducted at Danapur sub-divisional hospital. He had received one bullet injury," he said. The SHO said Rajkumar was killed at the spot while Manish had died in hospital. He added that raids are on to nab all the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/2-killed-two-shot-at-as-kids-fight-leads-to-clashes-on-holi/articleshow/81765744.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Patna||Now, mutation with registration of land in Bihar||PATNA: In a bid to reduce land-related disputes, the revenue and land reforms department is all set to unveil a new software today that will connect the offices of the sub-registrar with the circle offices to ensure land mutation at the time of registration. CM Nitish Kumar had recently cited land-related disputes as the main reason behind 60% of crimes committed in the state. "After assessing and studying different aspects of the land disputes...We found that more than 60% of crimes in the state have their roots in land-related disputes," the CM had said on December 8 last year, directing the land and revenue department officials to integrate the registration and mutation process to bring more transparency so that land disputes could be reduced. The revenue and land reforms minister Ram Surat Kumar will formally launch the new system on Wednesday, which will come into effect across the state from April 1. "With the new system coming into force, complaints related to mutation of land will come to an end," the minister said and added that the purpose behind this is to minimize disputes over land/property, which more often than not lead to crimes. However, the facility will be available only for those buyers who purchase land from persons having 'jamabandi' on their names, which means only those who own a piece of land through mutation can sell it. The sellers/buyers will have to fill up mutation forms along with the documents for registration of the land. The forms will be simultaneously forwarded to the circle office from the sub-registrar's office for simultaneous registration and mutation. In the new system, a mutation form will have details of the land, names of the buyer/seller among other relevant information. The copies of the sale/purchase deeds will be sent to the respective circle offices by NIC within hours of the registration. At present, land buyers have to submit online applications for mutation. Moreover, they have to attach copies of the deed of the purchased land with the mutation forms. "This is a cumbersome process, which often delays the mutation," a revenue and land reforms department official pointed out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/now-mutation-with-registration-of-land-in-state/articleshow/81765708.cms||Ramashankar

On Tuesday, police detained the deceased Amritlal Patel’s wife Lakshmi (71) following a complaint lodged by the victim’s nephew Kamlesh. On Monday, Lakshmi had gone to the temple and ever since she returned, her husband kept on accused her of having gone to meet some man. He allegedly kept abusing her throughout the day and even tried hitting her with a glass bottle. She dodged and managed to save herself. Kamlesh told police that his uncle and aunt used to fight frequently as the former always cast aspersions on her character. Around four times in the past, Kamlesh had to strike truce between the couple. Things came to a pass during dinner when Amritlal again started abusing her and tried to attack her. In retaliation, Lakshmi picked up the wooden washing paddle and hit him. He collapsed on the floor and suffered multiple injuries. “My uncle used to doubt my aunt and often fought with her. On Monday, during the fight she hit him on the head and he suffered injuries in the abdominal area and died,” Kamlesh told police. Amritlal had retired around 15 years ago from a leading textile mill in Mumbai. Lakshmi has studied up to graduation from Valsad. Both daughters of the couple are married and settled in the US and Dubai. Amritlal’s family is originally from Valsad town and his father was a superintendent in customs and central excise. The couple had shifted to Valsad from Mumbai 15 years ago. “The old man constantly doubted that his wife had an affair with someone. The family members had tried convincing several times in the past, but in vain,” said a police officer in Valsad town police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/78-year-old-retired-engineer-suspects-affair-71-yr-old-wife-kills-him/articleshow/81767280.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

The bidding process for the Rs 1,110-crore bridge, for which administrative approval was granted in 2019, had been initiated in July last year by MoRTH. The nod for construction of the bridge parallel to the existing Vikramshila Bridge, which was opened on July 23, 2001, was given in 2016. The requirement of another bridge was felt due to frequent traffic snarls on the existing two-lane narrow bridge. A detailed project report was submitted by state road construction department in 2018, which was approved by the expenditure finance committee of MoRTH in July 2020. Subsequently, PM Narendra Modi laid the foundation for the bridge through video conferencing from New Delhi on September 21 last year. Meanwhile, the former deputy CM, while thanking Union MoRTH minister Nitin Gadkari, said the 4.367-km long bridge with 68 pillars will be constructed 50-metre east of the Vikramshila Setu. “The state government has acquired 21.3 hectares of land needed for the bridge from its internal resources,” he added. “The parallel bridge will be constructed within four years,” Modi said in reference to Gadkari’s reply to his question in the Rajya Sabha recently. He added the construction company will maintain the bridge for 10 years after its commissioning. An NHAI official said 875-metre approach road, designated as NH-131B, on the northern end of the proposed bridge (Naugachia end) and 987-metre approach road on the southern end (Bhagalpur end) would also be constructed along with the parallel bridge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/contract-awarded-to-construct-bridge-over-ganga-in-bhagalpur/articleshow/81765847.cms||Kumar Rajesh

Intended to support people who have taken a professional break for various personal goals such as taking care of the family, raising a child or pursuing a life calling, the program will provide chosen candidates access to training, upskilling, mentorship and other resources, and after the 12 weeks, they would subsequently be considered for full-time positions at Cognizant. Launched in India currently, it is set to be rolled out globally over the next few months. While returnship programmes are fairly common in the corporate world today, Cognizant said the initiative will offer training, upskilling, mentorship and opportunities to work on live projects in cutting-edge digital skills. Cognizant says the programme is open to all professionals, regardless of gender, who wish to resume their careers after a break. Returnees are evaluated on the basis of past professional excellence, technical aptitude, learnability, energy, attitude, communication and people skills, among others. “A break in a professional’s career can give an opportunity to reflect, find areas of focus, and return stronger to the next phase of a professional journey with a renewed sense of purpose. Many such talented professionals looking to return to the workforce are women, and Cognizant’s inaugural cohort includes women taking on engineering management roles in the digital engineering practice,” Rajesh Nambiar, CMD, Cognizant India, said. “The programme is an innovative way to get diverse talent in the door, irrespective of when their last professional role was,” he added.Women professionals form around 38% of Cognizant's overall workforce in India and nearly 45% of the company’s workforce in tier-2 cities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/cognizants-returnship-programme-set-to-support-returnees/articleshow/81767626.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Business||India gilt in one of FTSE indices?||Mumbai: FTSE Russell, one of the leading index providers globally, may include Indian government bonds in its Emerging Government Bond Index, starting with a small weight. Inclusion in FTSE and also JP Morgan’s global bond indices, the two widely followed such indices globally, would attract additional foreign investments into Indian G-Secs, market players said. On the downside, however, are the facts that even if the Indian gilts are included in the index, the weight would be limited. One of the major hurdles for foreign bond investors would be the government-imposed exposure limits for such investors. Also, similar expectations were fuelled about Indian gilts in the past also but subsequently these were not included in those indices. According to Madhavi Arora, lead economist, Emkay Global Financial Services, this process of India’s global bond inclusion is unlikely to start before next the financial year. That said with India having created enough forex buffer, it might think of further easing capital account convertibility norms in coming years if global market remain sane which could fasten the process. “For India, the inclusion is being talked about for FTSE EMBI and not WGBI (World Government Bond Index). The expected quantum of flows in India will depend on the percent allocation to us. We note FTSE is a much smaller space than Bloomberg Barclays and JPM EMGBI when it comes to EM bond index, albeit a much bigger space in WGBI with wider passive investor following,” Arora said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/india-gilt-in-one-of-ftse-indices/articleshow/81767961.cms||---

The largest one was the Rs 6,480-crore offer from Gland Pharma. The response to IPOs was also buoyed by strong listing performance of these stocks, Haldea said. Of the 30 IPOs during the year, 18 IPOs were subscribed more than 10 times while four IPOs were subscribed by more than three times. The year also saw strong retail response with Indigo Paints receiving 25.88 lakh applications, the highest for any IPO during the year, followed by MTAR Technologies at 25.87 lakh and Mazagon Dock at 23.6 lakh. Of all the IPOs, the 131% listing gain for Burger King was the highest, followed by 123% in Happiest Minds Technologies and 109% in Indigo Paints. Of the 28 IPOs, which were listed (two were withdrawn), 18 are still trading above the IPO price. The IPO pipeline continues to remain strong with 18 companies holding Sebi approval for collecting raising nearly Rs 18,000 crore and another 14 companies are awaiting the regulatory nod to raise another Rs 23,000 crore, the note said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/cos-raise-rs-1-9l-cr-in-fy21-via-equities/articleshow/81768034.cms||---
---||Business||Life is not always fair, says Mistry after SC loss||MUMBAI: Four days after the Supreme Court dismissed all the appeals of Shapoorji Pallonji (SP) Group, scion Cyrus Mistry expressed disappointment over the judgment and said that “life is not always fair” and would take the “knocks on our chins”. Mistry also said that while in hindsight he may have had “many imperfections”, he has “no doubt or erosion of conviction about the direction I (he) chose, the integrity behind my (his) actions and their consequences”. Last week, the SC had upheld Tata Sons’ decision to remove Mistry from the chairmanship of the company, ending a four-year legal battle between the two. Mistry, who was handpicked by Tata Sons chairman emeritus Ratan Tata, served as its chief from December 29, 2012 to October 24, 2016, when he was unceremoniously removed in a boardroom coup. In a statement titled ‘Grateful for the opportunity — My conscience is clear’, Mistry said, “Every member of society looks to institutions such as courts to validate and endorse the appropriateness of his or her actions and beliefs. As a minority shareholder of Tata Sons, I am personally disappointed by the outcome of the judgment with respect to our case.” The SC had denied SP the right to have a representation on the board of Tata Sons in proportion to its minority stake of 18.4%, which it has been holding for decades. “Although I will no longer be able to influence the direction of governance of the Tata Group directly, I hope that the issues I have raised will cause deeper reflection and influence individuals concerned to catalyse change,” he added. “I sleep with a clear conscience.” Mistry, however, did not state his next move on selling SP’s shares in Tata Sons. The former chairman, who had raised several corporate governance issues at the Tata Group, said he has reflected on his actions since his ouster. “Over the last four years, I have had the opportunity to reflect on my actions and on whether I could have handled the generational change in leadership better. In hindsight, while I may have had many imperfections, I have no doubt or erosion of conviction about the direction I chose, the integrity behind my actions and their consequences,” his statement issued on Friday said. He also said that his effort right from the beginning at the Tata Group, “an iconic institution undergoing a generational change in leadership, was to ensure a robust board driven system of decision making and governance that is larger than any one individual”. A key focus was to enable the directors on various boards to discharge their fiduciary duties without fear or favour, while still ensuring that shareholders’ views were reflected in strategy and actions, Mistry continued in the statement. To this end, he said, “My performance was reviewed by nearly 50 independent directors across multiple Tata boards that I served. Beyond the performance metric that speaks for itself and the documented appreciation for my initiatives, I am humbled by the continued support I have received from my former colleagues and other board members.” Reflecting on the SC judgement, Mistry said, “Life is not always fair, but we are still the lucky ones —-I am lucky to have the unwavering support of my family, friends, colleagues - past and present...This is another step in the evolution of life for me and my family. We will celebrate the good times and take the knocks on our chins.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/life-is-not-always-fair-says-mistry-after-sc-loss/articleshow/81767811.cms||Reeba Zachariah

These services were suspended after its four doctors and a nurse were tested Covid positive even after being immunised with both the doses. Another nurse tested positive had not taken the vaccine. All the six are in home quarantine. Now, the NMCH administration has directed for Covid test of all children coming to its emergency with any problem with a view to be assured that they had not been infected with the virus. NMCH superintendent Dr Binod Kumar Singh said children above the age of two months reaching the emergency or recommended for admission in the children’s ward would first go through rapid antigen test available there round-the-clock. In case of testing positive or showing other symptoms, the hospital would do RTPCR test. “We already had tested about 110 children up to 14 years of age as Covid 19 positive in a year and all of them recovered after treatment,” he said. As the second wave of the viral disease has hit many states, children needed more care. He said the OPD of the paediatrics department also counselled the guardians to protect their children from the Covid-19 infection. Singh said, “Children often ignored the Covid appropriate behaviour, like use of masks, social distancing and hand sanitizing in their friend circles for playing or other activities and it posed a threat of getting infected.” Indoor games and less exposure to crowded places could help them protect. Only four children, including two newborns, reached the emergency for treatment on Tuesday. NMCH had served as a dedicated Covid hospital for months and many of its doctors, staff and medical students had tested positive to this virus earlier.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/covid-test-must-for-children-reaching-nmch-emergency/articleshow/81766439.cms||---

They are presently under home isolation.Nalanda civil surgeon Dr Sunil Kumar said the condition of the doctor couple – Dr Umesh Kumar Sinha and Dr Nirmala Sinha of Biharsharif sadar hospital – and the health worker was stable. He said their fresh test was delayed for a day due to Holi festival. Regarding the effectiveness of the vaccine, the civil surgeon said it slows down the severity of the disease by improving immunity. “It is wrong to say that inoculated persons cannot get infected. Everyone should use masks and maintain social distancing until they are advised otherwise. The earlier gap of four weeks between first and the second dose has now been revised to six to eight weeks,” he added. Dr Sinha said he and his wife developed cold and cough days after receiving second dose of Covid-19 jab. “The antigen test report came positive on March 25 and the RT- PCR test confirmed it the next day,” he added. Meanwhile, the Nalanda district administration has set up mobile corona test centres at railway stations and bus stands so that those coming from worst-hit states could be tested before they move to their native places. According to Nalanda civil surgeon Dr Sunil, the recovery rate of Covid-19 cases in Nalanda is 99.28%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/inoculated-doctor-couple-health-worker-test-positive-for-covid-in-nalanda/articleshow/81766411.cms||Farrukh Nadim

Three patients, one each in Krishna, Guntur and Visakhapatnam districts, succumbed to the pandemic, pushing up the toll to 7,213. Altogether 480 patients were declared cured on Tuesday. There are currently 6,614 active cases with 8,86,978 cumulative recoveries and 7,213 fatalities. The case positivity rate has been consistently above 3% for the last several days. Andhra Pradesh took 158 days to record the latest one lakh cases, the longest ever period taken to add any one-lakh cases. The state crossed its first one-lakh case mark on July 27, 2020, nearly 135 days after the state reported its first case on March 12. The second and third one-lakh cases came in just 11 days each. Meanwhile, in Vijayawada, city police and Vijayawada Municipal Corporation intensified their mask enforcement drive. Police, who are implementing compulsory mask usage in public, are conducting surprise checks in buses, cabs, share autos and imposing fines in case of violations. Officers of circle inspector rank are also addressing commuters. Commissioner of police B Srinivasulu is monitoring the campaign and directed officials penalise violators. In the last five days, traffic police collectively imposed a fine of Rs 12 lakh on 9,000 persons found roaming on the roads without masks.

---||Delhi||Nangloi lake gets a new lease of life||NEW DELHI: It used to be an eyesore, with bulbous hyacinth plants poking through garbage. The lake in northwest Delhi’s Nangloi today presents a better picture. The water is cleaner and that’s the purpose of the dozens of floating rafters. Delhi Jal Board has managed to revive the waterbody under its City of Lakes project, which aims at rejuvenating 155 dying ponds in the city. A DJB official said that the lake in Nangloi Jat area was abysmally contaminated and covered with water hyacinth, indicating a severe level of eutrophication, or over nourishment through inputs like pollution and sewage. “We mechanically removed the water hyacinth and cleaned the lake bed,” disclosed the official. “We have been working on this lake for the past three months and the water quality is improving due to the use of floating rafter technology developed by CSIR-National Environmental Engineering Research Institute.”. A DJB official said that the lake in Nangloi Jat area was abysmally contaminated and covered with water hyacinth.A DJB team headed by superintendent engineer Mukesh Jindal has been working on the project. It has taken around Rs 70 lakh to revive the 2.5-acre waterbody. “DJB will maintain the lake after cleaning is completed. We expect significant improvement in water quality and the parameters may not regress to such low levels as earlier,” the water utility official said. The “floating rafter islands” have hormone-treated plants, such as Cyprus and Canna. They are designed to soak up pollutants and purify the water. Each rafter comprises a 2x2 square metre contraption of PVC pipes lined with geo-net to support the plants. A blend of different plants is used on each float to increase the nutrient uptake. While the City of Lakes project has been marred by delays, DJB officials revealed that instead of taking up the projects on individual basis, 30-50 waterbodies of similar parameters are being clubbed together under a package to expedite the process. Recently, DJB created a new lake in Pappankalan near Dwarka. It is spread across 28,000 sq m and will recharging aquifers every day with more than 50 lakh litres of water. Public health officials of the municipal corporation said that the rejuvenation of these waterbodies and the cleaning of drains would together reduce dependence both on chemical methods to control mosquito breeding and facilitate the prevalence of the more eco-friendly bio-control methods such as using larvae eating Gambusia fish. The civic bodies currently spray insecticides and put bags soaked in mosquito larvicide oil in drains to prevent breeding and stop the growth of larvae. “The level of dissolved oxygen in waterbodies is so low that the fish cannot survive. With improvement in water quality, bio-control with fish can increase,” a health official reasoned. The civic bodies are using larvae eating fishes in 84 sites, 31 of them in north Delhi, 52 in south and one in east.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/nangloi-lake-gets-a-new-lease-of-life/articleshow/81767681.cms||Paras Singh

---||Patna||48 flights at Patna airport under summer schedule||PATNA: Altogether 48 flights to and from Jayaprakash Narayan International Airport (JPNI) are operational from Sunday as per the summer schedule released on Tuesday. Earlier, 47 flights were operating from the city airport as per the revised winter scheduled from February 5. Airport director Bhupesh CH Negi told TOI on Tuesday that the number of flights operated by different airlines has remained almost the same under the summer schedule as well. “Few airlines have added a few while others have reduced their flights. Thus, the overall number of flights operating from the airport has remained around the same,” Negi said. An IndiGo executive said two flights have been added to its winter schedule from Patna -- one direct flight each to Jaipur and Pune. Negi said one of the reasons behind not much change in the number of flights is a capping on total number of flights operated by the airlines in the country at 80% of their pre-Covid levels. The commercial domestic flight operations in the country remained suspended from March 23 to May 25 last year owing to Covid-induced lockdown. The civil aviation ministry in November last year allowed the airlines to operate 70% of their pre-Covid levels and the cap on the number of flights was further increased to 80% in December. “The cap of 80% will remain effective till April 30. This is why the airlines could not make substantial increase in the number of flights operated by them,” Negi said. He said few airlines have proposed to increase the number of flights from Patna but it is possible only if the civil aviation ministry raises or lifts the cap. “We are operating 20-21 flights daily from Patna airport and proposals are afoot to increase it up to 28. However, it will be possible only when the capping of 80% flights of pre-Covid level is lifted,” the IndiGo executive said. An executive of SpiceJet said they are operating 11 flights from Patna and it has remained unchanged in the latest summer schedule. As of now, Patna airport has direct connectivity to New Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Hyderebad, Pune, Bengaluru, Ahmedabad, Amritsar, Lucknow and Guwahati among others. Negi said 2-3 flights are normally allowed at a time considering the Covid-19 SoPs and preventive norms. Sources said fewer flights allow restricted number of passengers in the terminal building, which is undergoing expansion. “The new terminal building is targeted to be ready by 2023,” the airport director said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/48-flights-at-city-airport-under-summer-schedule/articleshow/81765662.cms||Piyush Tripathi

And yet, despite all the noise on social media by firms, what really has an impact? Why is that some organisations, even very successful ones, struggle with their employer brand? More visible consumer brands do have an edge in terms of recall. But does every consumer brand necessarily deliver an equivalent employer brand? Not always. And not necessarily. In my experience of attempting to build out and now advising corporations on their employer brand strategy, I have picked some key takeaways that help build such a strategic impact. Allow me to share these insights for a strong employer brand: * Employer brand is not employee value proposition (EVP): The EVP is a statement of intent of what the firm seeks to offer to its employees — existing or potential. Unfortunately, the brand perception does not mirror intent. And possibly even if the intent is actually in play, maybe the brand recall has no element of it. Companies have debated elements of EVP to death. But unfortunately, the best EVPs are too cluttered with little strategic differentiation. No surprise then that the brand has little defining stickiness. And it fails its purpose. * Employer brands must be catchment-specific: Too often, firms are themselves unclear about the seas they want to trawl. Who is the target? Should they target more upstream or stay focused only on the downstream? Who is their potential employee? Who influences these people? Why do they get influenced? What matters to this talent block which is different from others? Are we too broad-based and stereotypical in our catchments? Unless we really know where we want to fish, we don’t really know what net to throw. This is one of the most common failings in employer brand strategy. And you see so many variants of the same campaign. It does not set the organisation apart in any way. Understand the target better and focus on one thing that could set you apart, rather than throw the same mix of generic brand offerings. * Employer branding is a leadership deliverable, not just an HR or communications job: Another very commonplace gap that I observe is that, exceptions notwithstanding, not many leaders are adequately sensitive to both the power and need of a strong employer brand. As also their own role in it. In one of my corporate experiences, I remember I had to almost spoon-feed my peers to get to play their role in it. If leaders do not step up individually to advocate their workplace, it will be a big challenge for the effort. There are many leaders who have little demand pull in their own individual capacity. But could they at least lend some weight to building that out of their firms? How well do they role-model the aspirations and life at their firms when they meet various groups in their own industry or functional fraternities? Brand ambassadorship today is a leadership essential. I’m not sure how many leaders would pass the litmus test here. * Employee experience is your employer brand: No glitzy campaign, no leadership spiel is good enough for your employer brand if the actual experience of your associates is in contradiction of the articulated promise. Actually, this is the most hurtful element that damages the brand. I have heard stories from existing employees of experiences that are very different from what a CEO or a CXO may be saying from the pulpit. And this dichotomy finally corrodes the brand. Unfortunately, there is little executive conversation in most companies on these issues. And finally, the travesty of the campaigns spills out in WhatsApp jokes or Glassdoor comments, none of which helps the brand. * Alumni voice speaks loudest: Sometimes, employee experience could be termed as noise. At times, tough organisational circumstances may dictate unpopular reactions. But what a former member of the firm remembers of the association matters a lot. No institution is perfect. But at an aggregate, do most alumni feel the highs outweigh the lows? What do they remember about how their managers and leaders behaved with them? Often, the parting experience matters the most. Was that fair and warm? I am aware of firms who welcome with elan a new hire, but are cold with exits. This clearly is an antidote to all recruitment blitzkrieg. Make your alumni your most powerful ambassador. Just because the jersey changes, your relationship must not be forfeited. Create strong alumni association and, as I once crafted a platform in one of my former companies, they are ‘Friends Forever’. Employer brand-building is not just about decibel power or wallet spends. Indeed, if you don’t blow your own trumpet, who else will? But it is a deeper philosophical and strategic exercise. It needs honesty and empathy, it demands perseverance and ownership. It is yours to lose and yours to gain. Don’t just polish your brass, choose the right metal to build your employer brand.

---||Patna||Shah: Mamata’s ouster will bring much-desired change in Bengal||Nandigram: In a show of might ahead of the second phase of Bengal elections, Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Tuesday held a massive roadshow in Nandigram and called upon people to ensure the defeat of TMC chief Mamata Banerjee, who is contesting the polls from the high-profile constituency. He stressed that defeating Banerjee from Nandigram would be a precursor to the much-desired change that Bengal had long been waiting for. Standing atop a lorry, decked up with flowers and BJP flags, the Union minister, with TMC turncoat and party candidate Suvendu Adhikari by his side, waved at enthusiastic crowd that gathered along the four-km stretch between Bethuria and Reyapara in the East Midnapore assembly segment. Locals queued up on two sides of the road and watched the procession, which inched its way through the narrow streets amid chants of 'Jai Shri Ram', 'Narendra Modi Zindabad' and 'Amit Shah Zindabad'. Later, while talking to reporters at BJP party office in Reyapara area, Shah exuded confidence that saffron camp candidate Suvendu Adhikari will win the elections from Nandigram by a record margin. “I bow my head before the people of Nandigram for coming out in support of the BJP. Today, when I came here, I saw jubilant faces everywhere. I want to express my gratitude to the people of Nandigram. Now, I am confident that Suvendu Adhikari will win the polls from Nandigram,” he stated. Shah said that the saffron party's victory margin “should be so big that no politician would dare to fool the masses with false promises ever again”. “In Nandigram, we don't just intend to ensure Suvendu's victory but also seek to guarantee development. I would like to request the people here to vote for Suvendu in large numbers so that no one in the future dares to play with the sentiments of 'Ma', 'Mati' and 'Manush'. “By defeating Mamata didi in Nandigram, you can bring about the much-desired change in West Bengal. You defeat her here; the TMC will automatically get defeated in other parts of the state,” he said. Referring to a recent incident of rape in Nandigram, Shah wondered why women are not safe in the state, despite “tall claims” made by Banerjee. “It is unfortunate that a woman was raped in Nandigram. She (Mamata) talks big about women's safety. What is the situation here? A woman was raped here, just a few kilometres away from where she has been putting up in teh constituency,” he said.

On Sunday, 304 persons had tested positive from 5,124 tests.Besides the number of new cases registered every day, the number of active cases has also been on a rise consistently. On Tuesday, 1,572 active cases were reported in the city and district. This was only on Friday that the number of active cases had crossed 1,000 and 1,039 cases were reported on the day.A major reason for the rise in the number of active cases is that when Covid-19 numbers start rising sharply, the number of new cases tend to surpass the discharge number. On Tuesday, 175 persons were discharged. The number was less than half of the number of new cases reported in the city and district. The number of active cases on Tuesday include 103 persons on ventilators or BIPAP machines in a serious condition and 169 on oxygen support. The number of patients needing oxygen support and ventilator or BIPAP machine shave also been on a rise consistently.The death toll due to Covid-19 in the city and district reached 249 as two more succumbed since Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/vadodara-situation-grim-as-official-cases-cross-300/articleshow/81765323.cms||---

While daily cases in the initial days of March remained mostly in single digits, Noida has reported over 40 cases every day in the past four days.With the rise in numbers, active cases have also doubled in the past week. From 150 on March 24, the number of active cases in the district stood at 312 on March 29. A look at the data available till Tuesday evening revealed that almost half of Noida’s Covid cases in March have come in the past week. The first 23 days of the month had added just 263 cases to the district’s Covid tally, but the last 254 cases were reported in a week itself. Much of this sharp spike in numbers can be attributed to the increased testing. Noida, which had been testing 3,500 samples in the first week of March, increased its daily rate to around 4,500 in the run up to Holi. The district has also started random testing of travellers at the borders with Delhi and strengthened its efforts in tracing people with a recent history of travel. The district had reported just 66 cases in the first week of March and added 65 new cases in the second week. The third week from March 15 to 21 saw a small surge with 88 cases. But March 24 onwards, Noida’s numbers are almost equivalent to the three weeks combined.The first point of inflexion came on March 19, when 26 new cases were reported. Till March 18, cases in double digits were reported only for seven days. But the rise in cases from the third of March to the fourth was nearly three times.The second point of disruption came on March 24, when 37 cases were added to the tally. Two days later, Noida breached the 40-case mark. And since then, the number of cases has been over 50 on an average.Active cases have also seen a surge. On March 1, the number of active cases in the district stood at 70, while the figure was 312 on March 29. This shows an increase of over four times in four weeks.Officials said a rise in outdoor activity before Holi had played a crucial role in the spike in cases. “The number of cases reported daily has increased in the run up to Holi. It is clear that people had started taking Covid norms lightly. In the days preceding the festival, people were mingling with each other freely in markets and other shopping hubs. These may have contributed to the spread of the infection,” said a district health official. Officials warned that cases were likely to continue rising after the festivities were over. People in many housing societies had let their guard down and played Holi, which would put them at risk of contracting the infection in the absence of any social distancing or other such safety norms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/half-of-noidas-march-tally-was-recorded-in-last-week/articleshow/81768898.cms||Snehil Sinha

Officials said that railways has deployed additional Railway Protection Force (RPF) and Railway Protection Special Force (RPSF) personnel at all major stations falling under the division to ensure safe movement of passengers on railway platforms during the peak hours. Railway security personnel and station staff at Patna Junction, Rajendra Nagar Terminal, Patliputra Junction and Danapur, which are the main hub of passenger trains, have been brought under strict surveillance to maintain health protocol advisory issued fresh by the Centre and the state health department during post-Holi special passenger train movements. According to Danapur divisional railway manager (DRM) Sunil Kumar, senior railway officials of the division have been asked to remain present at these stations during peak hours to streamline traffic operations. “Station directors and station masters have been asked to avoid last moment changes of platform for incoming special passenger trains at Patna Junction. Regular announcements about arrival and departure of passenger trains are being made for the convenience of passengers,” he said . “Railways has already installed security cameras at Rajendra Nagar Terminal, Danapur, Patliputra Junction, Ara and Buxar. Three dog squads have been pressed into service at Patna Junction to carry random checks inside coaches of premier special passenger trains either originating from or passing through Patna Junction,” the DRM added. He said: “Though confirmed ticket holders are only allowed to enter station premises, railways has started random thermal screening on the platforms of these stations in view of the recent surge in Covid-19 cases in other states. Railway health staff and security personnel have been asked to keep an eye on each special passenger train reaching Patna Junction from Mumbai, Delhi, Punjab and Karnataka.

The local party leaders turn a bit restless and vent their disquiet over the delay to UDF constituency committee chairman Ahmed Kutty Unnikulam who had arrived at the venue ahead of the candidate. "The selfies derailed the schedule. The candidate’s visit to Villunnimala and other colonies, which started in the morning, is not yet over as people are insisting on taking selfies with him at every location. So, please wait a bit more," Unnikulam tries to pacify the local leaders. A ripple of excitement spreads through the crowd as Dharmajan finally arrives at around 1.30 pm. The crowd, who till then seemed weary due to the heat and having had to wait without having their lunch, all at once becomes alive and pushes towards the dais. Almost all of them pull out their mobiles and remain standing to click pictures and record videos of the actor. Dharmajan, donning an air of seriousness, gives a short and simple speech, emphasizing the development issues of the constituency which had elected only LDF MLAs for the past four and a half decades. "Balussery has not seen much development during the past 45 years and those who had been getting elected from here have deceived people’s trust. The roads are in tatters and even drinking water availability has not been ensured for all. I know the people of Balussery don't have many sky-high dreams, but sadly, even the basic needs of the people have not been fulfilled,” Dharmajan tells TOI. He added that though it is his maiden electoral contest, he was part of the ground-level election campaigns for Congress in several elections in Kochi in the past, doing everything from pasting posters on walls to making announcements over loudspeakers. As with everywhere else, as soon as his speech ends, people swarm him for selfies which takes another 15 minutes off from his campaign schedule. Asked about the “selfie crowd”, Dharmajan said that it was a normal reaction of people on seeing a film actor and not all of them would turn to votes. "Selfies are more of the love people have towards me. I am approaching the voters with a development plan for the constituency and that is what matters more," he said. It is for the first time in recent years that the constituency, which has remained a socialist stronghold, is seeing a lively electoral contest, except when UDF raised a serious challenge against the LDF in the 2001 election. Actor Ramesh Pisharody and many other actors have visited the constituency to seek votes for Dharmajan. A Congress candidate has not won from Balussery for five decades. After late A C Shanmughadas aligned with LDF in 1980, the constituency sent him to the assembly six times in a row till he gave way to NCP’s A K Saseendran who elected in the 2006 election. After Balussery became a reserved constituency in 2010 delimitation, CPM took over the seat and party candidate Purushan Kadalundi won from here twice, with a lead of 15,494 votes in 2016. But the constituency has been favouring UDF in recent parliamentary elections and M K Raghavan had won with a lead of 9,745 votes. CPM is not perturbed by the celebrity candidate in its turf and is confident that its young candidate, SFI state secretary K M Sachin Dev would win convincingly in the traditionally Left-leaning seat. During his visit to the hilly areas of Koorachundu, where settler farmers make up for most of the population, Sachin Dev stops by the Ongil Jacobite church before proceeding to the meeting nearby where he focuses mainly on seeking continuity of LDF government to take the welfare measures forward. “This constituency has traditionally stood with the Left. The electorate, mostly comprising farmers and ordinary people, are very politically conscious. So, whoever may be the candidate in the LDF and UDF, it will be political votes that count here. LDF has a definite advantage on that on the strength of its policies, the track record of the LDF government and the development works implemented in the constituency,” Dev says. Of the nine panchayats in the constituency, six are ruled by LDF while three are with UDF. BJP candidate Libin Balussery, district vice president of Bharatiya Janatha Yuva Morcha, who is playing up his son- of- the- soil tag, says people will use this election as an opportunity to register their protest against the politics of corruption and appeasement practised by both LDF and UDF and against the atrocities carried out against believers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/udfs-dharmajan-livens-up-contest-in-socialist-stronghold/articleshow/81767679.cms||---

The bank said that it informed the RBI about the fraud on March 30. Last month, Karnataka Bank had said that it reported its Rs 34-crore exposure to IL&FS Transportation as fraud. The Mangalore-based bank had said that the ITNL had availed credit facilities from the private lender in 2016 under multiple banking arrangements where Karnataka Bank was one of the member banks. The loan was classified as a non-performing asset in 2018 and has been fully provided for. In terms of RBI norms, banks have to fully provide for a loan that has been classified as fraud. Also when a borrower is classified as a fraud, other members of banks in the consortium invariably have to follow. Since it is more than two years since the loan was classified as NPA, most banks have fully provided for their exposure and the fraud classification does not have any material impact on their finances.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ilfs-transportation-classified-fraud-by-ps-bank/articleshow/81768121.cms||---
---||Business||HDFC Sec users face stock quote mismatch||Mumbai: HDFC Securities customers have been complaining of a mismatch between stock quotes displayed by the mobile application and those available online. There have also been instances of distorted portfolio valuation numbers experienced by the stock broker’s customers. Responding to query from TOI, an HDFC Securities spokesperson said that it was an “intermittent issue” and the brokerage firm was working with vendors to identify the root cause of the problem. Users have been complaining that the live prices displayed by HDFC Securities do not represent the actual prices, which could result in investment decisions being taken on wrong information. Also, for those who take an asset allocation approach to investment, an incorrect portfolio valuation could result in them buying or selling shares when they did not plan to. Ramesh Surwade, an HDFC Securities customer, who has been documenting the discrepancies, pointed out how when the app shows a portfolio at a loss of Rs 14,770, the web portal displayed a portfolio that was in profit by Rs 42,298. “These are not intermittent issues. This has been happening consistently and continuously without exception,” Surwade said. According to market sources, the accuracy of live quotes depends on the agreement between the exchange and the service provider. In cases where quotes are being provided only for information, the websites have an agreement to provide delayed quotes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hdfc-sec-users-face-stock-quote-mismatch/articleshow/81767901.cms||---
---||Patna||Holi celebrations remain subdued amid Covid pandemic||PATNA: The coronavirus pandemic did cast its shadow on Holi celebrations in Patna this year as most people preferred to stay indoors with their own family members. Most of the city roads wore a deserted look on Monday as no Holi mandalis or groups came out in the open to celebrate the festival of colours. Covid protocols were followed at most of the places as even during Holika dahan previous evening, people were seen maintaining social distance around the bonfire. The entire celebrations were low-key and subdued this time as the state government had already banned mass gatherings and imposed stringent restrictions in a bid to curb the spread of the deadly infection. According to a retired professor of A N College, Badri Narain Singh of Punaichak locality, people celebrated Holi on a very subdued scale this year for fear of Covid infection. Most residents of the apartment in which he lives did not play wet Holi during daytime and remained confined to their flats. Only during the evening hours, they greeted each other with dry colour powder (abeer) for a very limited period and enjoyed some Holi songs played on amplifiers. Some children, however, sprinkled coloured water through pichkaris on one other, Singh said. Even in Bazar Samiti area, Holi celebrations were a very low-key affair. Very few people were seen moving in groups from one mohalla to the other and pouring buckets full of coloured water or (sometimes even mud). The faces of most people remained quite clean, with only patches of some gentle colour, as little amount of colour was applied on their faces, said a local resident, Dinesh Prasad. Generally, most social organisations used to hold ‘Holi Milan’ with lots of fun and frolic combined with musical extravaganza. But this time, hardly any such activity was held anywhere owing to restrictions imposed by the authorities. Even the annual celebrations of ‘Mahamurkh Sammelan’ and other laughter sessions organised by some prominent socio-cultural organisations were given a miss this year, said Rangvani president Vishwanath Shukla Chanchal. "The Holi celebrations this year remained restricted to our taste buds as we ate so many tasty dishes prepared by women folks in our homes on the occasion of Holi. Both mutton and chicken were available in plenty, though at a higher price, and different varieties of sweets were either prepared at home or bought from the market,” said Gopal Sharan Singh of Anandpuri locality.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/holi-celebrations-remain-subdued-amid-covid-pandemic/articleshow/81766283.cms||B K Mishra

Some of them are allegedly named in the murder of an 18-year-old inmate from Ahmedabad who was killed last February. The seven started vandalizing the doors, windows and glass furniture and then tried to slit their wrists, said Shani Parmar, superintendent of observation home. “We informed the police and after pacifying them, sent them to the civil hospital for primary treatment,” said B M Patel, police inspector, B-division. District social welfare officer Jashu Chaudhary said it looks like they took the drastic step not to end their lives but out of sheer frustration of being constantly confined.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/seven-inmates-of-observation-hometry-to-end-lives/articleshow/81767268.cms||---

Bhagwan, once a close confidante of CM Nitish Kumar, met former state president of the JD(U) and Rajya Sabha member Bashishtha Narayan Singh at his residence here on Monday, giving rise to speculation about his “homecoming” soon. Singh had played a crucial role in the merger of former Union minister and Koeri caste leader Upendra Kushwaha-led Rashtriya Lok Samta Party (RLSP) with the JD(U) recently. Upendra was later appointed as chairman of the national parliamentary board of the JD(U). “Bashistha Babu is our guardian. We have always honoured his directive. However, it is a fact that I had left the JD(U) after being denied ticket in the assembly polls. But I always remained in touch with the party leadership,” Bhagwan said. Bhagwan had unsuccessfully contested the assembly election from Jagdishpur assembly seat in Bhojpur district as an independent. He has considerable influence among the people belonging to Koeri caste. Asked about his meeting with Bhagwan, Singh said, “He had never dissociated himself from the JD(U). His decision to quit the party largely depended on the situation of that time, which is immaterial in the present context.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/another-koeri-face-may-return-to-jdu/articleshow/81765865.cms||Ramashankar

But Shakuntala Chaudhary ended up paying a heavy price for the at-home hair colouring service when cybercrooks conned her out of Rs 1 lakh. Her mistake: She looked for the company’s contact number on Google search, instead of checking its website. The 28-year-old Thaltej resident filed a complaint against unidentified people with Sola police on Monday. Chaudhary, who works as an automation engineer with a private firm, said in her FIR that she had bought a box of hair colour from a mall near Iskcon crossroads around two months ago. The packet contained the card of a known home services platform that promised to send someone home to provide hair colour service. Chaudhary googled for Urban Company’s customer care number and dialled a cellphone number listed on Google search. A person picked the call and asked her to download ‘Any Desk’ application to avail the service. “The application gave the accused access to her cellphone. After that, the person told her to pay Re 1 using the PhonePe app. She tried to do as instructed but the transaction did not take place. The person then asked her to share her debit card number, card expiry date and CVV number. She gave them the details. Afew minutes later, she found that around Rs 1 lakh had been debited from her bank account. She called up police control and filed a complaint of cheating with the cybercrime police. Later, her complaint under charges of cheating and information technology act was transferred to Sola police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/thaltej-woman-calls-for-at-home-hair-colour-service-conned-out-of-rs-1-lakh/articleshow/81766798.cms||---

The incident occurred at village Mankoshi under Moratal panchayat. The villagers had assembled on the occasion of Holika Dahan. After the bonfire was lit the boys had gone to the nearby hills where one of them threw a burning thatch of the Holika. The dried heap of grass and bushes caught fire in which the boys got trapped. They tried to escape but failed. On hearing their screams, villagers tried to rescue them but could not reach them. While three boys Rohit, Nandlal Manjhi and Upendra Manjhi succumbed to their burn injuries, another Sunny Kumar has been admitted at the Anugrah Narayan Magadh Medical College and Hospital (ANMMCH) in a critical condition. The villagers did not inform the police about the incident and cremated the bodies without getting a postmortem done. Bodhgaya SHO Mitesh Kumar said, "The villagers have not lodged any complaint in this regard. An unnatural death case has been lodged in connection with the incident." When contacted, Bodhgaya DSP Ajay Prasad said, "The kin of deceased can’t be forced to get postmortem of the body done. After postmortem, it becomes easy to get compensation as per the provisions of disaster management department".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/3-boys-charred-to-death-in-bodh-gaya-during-holika-dahan/articleshow/81765821.cms||---
---||Pune||Delayed payments to hospitals by PMC, state has led to 'artificial' bed shortage: Activists||Pune: Private hospitals have shrunk the number of reserved Covid-19 beds because the state and the municipal corporation have still not fully settled hospitalisation bills. The reduction, health activists alleged, has caused false alarm in Pune as many believe the region has run out of beds. The shortage, in fact, is artificial, they added. The divisional commissioner's dashboard on Monday (March 29) showed 85 available ventilator-supported ICU beds out of 553 reserved ICU beds in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad. In the state overall, there are 9,030 ventilator-supported ICU beds that have been reserved for patients with Covid. Of them, 1,881 are currently occupied, state health officials have said. Health activist Abhijit More said, "The current bed crunch for Covid patients is artificial. Failure to fully reimburse private hospitals' previous bills is mainly the reason why private hospitals in Pune have not allocated more beds for Covid patients. They feel betrayed by the state government and the PMC." Also, most private hospitals in Pune had scores of non-Covid patients occupying a large number of beds when Covid cases started rising again. Officials had allowed the facilities to focus more on general patients when caseloads had started to ease a few months ago. "And now that the Covid cases are rising, the PMC wants us to start reserving beds again for Covid patients. But where should we send the non-Covid patients who are already occupying the beds? We have already stopped new non-Covid admissions. As for payment of old bills, we have received only 50% of our dues so far," said Bomi Bhote, president of the Association of Hospitals in Pune. The dues arise from the 80:20 rule the state had imposed on private hospitals. The facilities were asked to set aside 80% of their beds for Covid patients. The reserved beds also came with caps on treatment fees, with hospitals promised compensation or reimbursements from local governments. Rubal Agarwal, additional commissioner of the PMC said, “To cater the increasing demand for hospital beds, we have issued an order of 80:20 bed reservation across 23 private hospitals in the Pune civic limits. These 23 facilities will have to make sure 80% of their beds are available for Covid treatment only." She added, "We have added 50 more ICU beds with ventilator support across three facilities. Around 30 such beds are now available at Army Hospital, 10 at the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Hospital and 10 at the CoEP jumbo unit." Jitendra Oswal, deputy medical director, Bharati hospital said, "After Covid cases started dropping mid-September, private hospitals in Pune slowly started converting Covid beds into non-Covid beds to cater to pending elective surgeries and other illnesses. When cases started rising again in March this year, most hospitals' beds were full with non-Covid patients. So there has been a delay in reserving more beds for Covid patients." Oswal added, "Delays in payments of Covid patients' bills and lack of clarity on who will settle these bills surely are reasons why private hospitals are going slow on bringing more beds under Covid care.” Medical expert H K Sale, of Noble hospital, said, "The state government has capped Covid treatment charges - no one can charge above the limit. But the state and the PMC should make release payments for these bills every month so that we can pay our employees on time. How can people work at private hospitals without pay? This is the time for everyone to come forward and help each other."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/delayed-payments-to-hospitals-by-pmc-state-has-led-to-artificial-bed-shortage-activists/articleshow/81760747.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Mumbai||MahaRERA tells developer to refund home buyer, pay Rs 1L for mental agony in Mumbai||Mumbai: In a recent order, MahaRERA ordered Runwal Realty to refund a home buyer Rs25 lakh, which she had paid as booking amount along with 10.4% interest from the date of payment, after the promoter cancelled allotment of the flat. MahaRERA adjudicating officer Madhav Kulkarni in his order also directed the developer to pay the complainant Rs 1 lakh towards mental agony and Rs20,000 as costs of complaint. Nita Joshi had booked a flat worth Rs 7.2 crore in Runwal Reserve at Worli and paid Rs 25 lakh on June 15, 2018. Joshi, represented by advocate Nilesh Gala, alleged the promoter did not give an allotment letter and had issued only a receipt for the money paid. The complainant also alleged the promoter had not provided all documents. On August 3, 2018, the developer demanded that the home buyer pay Rs 4 crore within 15 days. A similar demand was made a month later. Subsequently, the builder issued a cancellation letter on December 4, 2018. The complainant approached MahaRERA seeking refund and compensation for mental agony. The promoter, represented by advocate Subit Chakravarty, alleged the home buyer had defaulted in payment. He pointed out that not more than 10% of the consideration was accepted and there is no case of not giving possession of the flat as per the agreement. The promoter also alleged that the home buyer had not come forward to execute the agreement and that all documents were emailed to her. The promoter also contended that Rs 25 lakh was not refundable as it was earnest money. The adjudicating officer observed the promoter had “whimsically demanded Rs 4 crore from the complainant though the agreement for sale was not executed and the allotment letter was not issued”. The respondent cannot demand more than 10% of the flat cost without execution of agreement for sale. There is nothing on record to show that the promoter called upon the complainant to execute an agreement for sale, he said. On the promoter’s claim that the amount received from the complainant was the earnest money and therefore liable for forfeiture, it was observed “the terms of agreement were not concluded and the obligations on the part of both parties were not yet made clear”. It was further observed that the promoter without taking steps for execution of agreement had unilaterally cancelled the agreement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharera-tells-developer-to-refund-home-buyer-pay-rs-1l-for-mental-agony-in-mumbai/articleshow/81768978.cms||Sanjeev Devasia

Names of the candidates will be declared on the letter head of the zonal in charge and the list will be made public so that there is no confusion. “The election is not being fought on party symbols so it is essential for us to make it clear who our candidate is. In the past, there used to a lot of confusion over who the party was supporting since we never really made it official. Often multiple candidates contested on one seat. Therefore, it has been decided to formally announce the names this time,” said a senior party member. BSP is expected to declare the first list of candidates on April 2, a day before the nomination process for the first phase of elections on April 15. Another party member added that in the last panchayat elections, BSP had won more seats than even the Samajwadi Party, which was party in power then. This year, SP has allowed its local units to decide on candidates, failing which even multiple party workers will be allowed to contest from a single seat. “BSP continues to have strong support in rural UP and we will see its impact in the elections. We cannot comment on SP’s decision to allow multiple candidates on any seat because for us it has not worked. If we were to give that option, there would be multiple candidates on all seats. We are confident of a good result, which is why we are not scared of openly supporting candidates,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bsp-to-officially-back-candidates-this-time/articleshow/81768929.cms||Neha Lalchandani

While 1.80 lakh seats remain vacant, 65,000 students did not take admission in the allotted seat or did not get admission even after multiple rounds. This year, there was the longest delay in the admission process due to the pandemic. The highest vacancy of 46% was in Aurangabad Municipal Corporation limits where only 16,948 students took admission against 31,470 available seats, while the lowest vacancy of 21.99% was in Nashik Municipal Corporation limits, where 19,712 students took admission against 25,270 seats. The admission process started on August 1 with students being allowed to fill up part I of the form. However, after the first round of admissions, there were over two months of a gap because of the Supreme Court’s stay on the Maratha reservation, post which the process resumed on November 26, after converting the reserved SEBC seats into general seats. In Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation limits, 71,722 students took admissions while 35,493 seats were vacant. Audumbar Ukirde, deputy director of education for the Pune division, said, “There will be no further rounds of admission in FYJC. The colleges have been conducting online classes for students since schools and colleges have not reopened. For the students who have taken admission late, we have told the colleges to conduct classes for on and a half hours more than the duration of regular classes, so that they can come to the same level as the other students.

---||Ahmedabad||Freed labourers move HC for release papers||Ahmedabad: After being rescued as bonded labourers, two youths have approached the Gujarat high court seeking directions to the authority to acknowledge that they were trafficked, engaged as bonded labourers and to issue them a certificate that they were released from the bondage. According to the case details, Rahul Bariya (19) and Manoj Bariya (17) were allegedly trafficked to Dholai Bandar (port) in Navsari district in September 2020 under promise of dignified employment and suitable working hours. But they were subjected to extreme physical and verbal abuse and made to work in abysmal conditions. A month later, when there was no word from the teens, Manoj’s father filed a complaint with Vapi police about disappearance of his son. The National Campaign Committee for Eradication of Bonded Labour was also approached. On October 16, 2020, Rahul fled from his employers and contacted NGO Bandhua Mukti Morcha. Vapi police took him along to the port, but Manoj was not traceable. He, however, was found three days later. After both the youths were freed, they were allowed to go without being produced in the district magistrate’s court, which is a procedure. In November 2020, the district magistrate and the sub-divisional magistrate of Chikhli were requested to issue release certificates for Rahul and Manoj and extend other relief.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/freed-labourers-move-hc-for-release-papers/articleshow/81766809.cms||---

On being asked about the motive of the crime, the officer said, “As he was not an habitual offender, we accepted what he has been saying and as he has been repenting then there was no need to question him further on the issue.” Ghatlodia police on Sunday arrested Meet Jethwa, a final-semester MBBS student of NHL Medical College in Ellisbridge, and a resident of Adalaj in Gandhinagar, for stealing 16 boxes of Covid-19 antigen testing kits from the Ghatlodia urban health centre on March 24. Cops swung into action after the medical officer of the urban health centre, Dr Pavan Patel, filed an FIR for the theft. Patel stated in his FIR that a staff member told him that Jethwa, who was identified later, had put boxes containing the kits in a bag and then fled in his car. Patel said Jethwa had stolen 16 boxes of kits, each worth Rs 39,200. Each box had 25 kits meant for free testing at the urban health centre. As Patel provided the registration number of the car, the cops could trace the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/mbbs-student-repentant-about-corona-test-kits-theft-say-cops/articleshow/81767688.cms||---

While 1.80 lakh seats remain vacant, 65,000 students did not take admission in the allotted seat or did not get admission even after multiple rounds. This year, there was the longest delay in the admission process due to the pandemic. The highest vacancy of 46% was in Aurangabad Municipal Corporation limits where only 16,948 students took admission against 31,470 available seats, while the lowest vacancy of 21.99% was in Nashik Municipal Corporation limits, where 19,712 students took admission against 25,270 seats. The admission process started on August 1 with students being allowed to fill up part I of the form. However, after the first round of admissions, there were over two months of a gap because of the Supreme Court’s stay on the Maratha reservation, post which the process resumed on November 26, after converting the reserved SEBC seats into general seats. In Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation limits, 71,722 students took admissions while 35,493 seats were vacant. Audumbar Ukirde, deputy director of education for the Pune division, said, “There will be no further rounds of admission in FYJC. The colleges have been conducting online classes for students since schools and colleges have not reopened. For the students who have taken admission late, we have told the colleges to conduct classes for on and a half hours more than the duration of regular classes, so that they can come to the same level as the other students. The students in the ‘not admitted’ category are those who were allotted colleges but who didn’t confirm their seats.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/1-80l-fyjc-seats-vacant-65k-students-stay-away-from-allotted-seats/articleshow/81766806.cms||Ardhra Nair

Following the arguments, Ilma went off to sleep but Mankar was still seething with anger. Mankar picked up a sharp-edged weapon and hit Ilma thrice on her head while she was sleeping, killing her immediately. Police arrested Mankar on Monday after Dharmesh Timbariya, the owner of the farm where the couple used to live and work, informed the cops. “The couple is native of Chhota Udepur and used return to their village every year during Holi. Since they could not go this year, they had a small ceremony outside their house in the farm. But they had an argument as the accused had forgotten some rituals,” said a police official. The couple has three daughters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/man-kills-wife-after-arguments-over-holi-rituals/articleshow/81765654.cms||---
---||Kochi||Thrissur remains unpredictable amid tight contest||Thrissur: The choice crisis, faced by members of the Christian community, is a major factor that complicates a realistic assessment of the poll scene in Thrissur where Congress leader Padmaja Venugopal, CPI’s P Balachandran and actor Suresh Gopi of NDA are engaged in an intense contest. Community break-up, political issues, charisma of candidates, emotional issues like Thrissur Pooram are also likely influence the outcome. Rough estimates indicate that Christians have the highest vote share in Thrissur followed by Nairs, Ezhavas and Muslims. Christian community used to support UDF and former speaker Therabmil Ramakrishnan was elected for six consecutive terms with its support. The record was broken in 2016 when CPI leader and present agri minister VS Sunilkumar defeated Padmaja by over 6,000 votes. Congress had won here in 2011 with a margin of over 10,000 votes. Apart from the LDF wave in 2016, a shift by a section of Christian voters contributed to the change, said political observers. “We are caught between the devil and the sea. Polarisation that is gripping the country is a major worry for us. Despite the assurances of central leaders, attacks on Christian community are continuing in north India. In Kerala, both fronts are appeasing a community which is the majority section among the minorities. We are also worried about Love Jihad,” said a leader of church’s laity group. This confusion has worried UDF. Nair community also used to rally behind UDF when Ramakrishnan, a former NSS leader, was contesting. But their choice was not unanimous in previous elections. Though Nair community leaders have not come forward with a choice this , there are hints of a shift towards Padmaja. Their argument is that LDF has made NSS leadership hostile and Gopi is already a Rajya Sabha member and hence Padmaja deserves a chance. There are multiple affinities among Ezhava community with some sections aligning with NDA, others with LDF, UDF. Muslim community hasn’t voiced a unified opinion though anti-BJP and anti LDF views are visible among its articulate sections. Campaigning was low-profile in the early phase here as there was uncertainty over NDA nominee even after the BJP leadership chose Gopi owing to his ill-health. There were reports that he was reluctant to contest in Thrissur and had suggested Guruvayur as an alternative. When BJP’s national leadership insisted he had no option. But once he entered the fray cinema style, the pace of campaign changed for all candidates. But, his comments on the prospects of candidates in Guruvayur have confused the BJP camp. “Most of the negative images I had in 2016 have vanished. Even those who were turning away from me during 2016 campaign came saying that they were under some wrong impression then,” said Padmaja. Party insiders say there is a feeling among some voters that K Karunakaran’s daughter should win. Balachandran has a wide network of friends, transcending politics here and Sunilkumar has nurtured the constituency during his term with several developmental projects. He has been a dynamic presence intervening at micro and macro levels. Balachandran feels that along with the achievements of LDF government, Sunilkumar’s projects will work wonders for him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/thrissur-remains-unpredictable-amid-tight-contest/articleshow/81767694.cms||---
---||Noida||As cases spike, Noida identifies 7 clusters||Noida: At a time weekly cases in the district have seen a three-time surge since March 24, the Noida health department has fallen back on its strategy of identifying clusters and strengthening surveillance measures around them. Of the 517 cases that were reported in Noida till March 29, nearly 50% — 254 — have come in the past week itself. The district has already identified seven clusters, among them highrises, and is in the process of listing down more. Lotus Boulevard, a highrise with 8,000 residents in Sector 100, had around 10% of the district’s active cases last week. The administration had set up a testing camp and a surveillance drive in the society following the sudden spurt in cases. Nearly 90 people were tested during the camp, and one of them was found to have Covid. The RWA also played a crucial role in the surveillance. It had written to the district administration to conduct a testing drive in the society. “When total cases in the district were less than 170, 23 of them were from our society. We had to inform the administration so that adequate steps could be taken. We have also stopped all activities at the club for four days, starting a day before Holi. We now have 16 active cases and no resident has been found to have Covid in the past 72 hours,” said Sanjeev Singh, secretary of the AOA. Police teams have also been making rounds of the society and asking people to avoid crowding and take necessary precautions. The residents are planning to ask the health department to conduct another camp next week and assess the situation in the aftermath of Holi. For most of March, there were hardly any clusters in the city because cases were in single digits. The recent clusters that the health department has identified are some of those that had reported more cases earlier as well. Among them are sectors 62 and 22. In other areas such as Gaur City, multiple families have been infected. “We have identified a few focus areas where we are taking additional steps such as surveillance and focused sampling and testing. RT-PCR tests have been ramped up. However, there are no additional restrictive measures as of now. We are also asking people to self-regulate and maintain sanitation,” said Suhas LY, the district magistrate. Some of the other areas that have reported cases include Gaur City 1, which has 11 active cases, Gaur City 2 with 14 cases, Sector 62 and Ashok Vatika in Jaypee Greens with five cases each and Sector 22 with four cases.The last few days have been a cause for concern for the health department in terms of daily cases. The district had reported just 66 cases in the first week of March and added 65 new cases in the second week. The third week from March 15 to 21 saw a small surge with 88 cases. But March 24 onwards, Noida’s numbers is almost equivalent of the three weeks combined. Officials have said a rise in outdoor activity before Holi had played a crucial role in the spike in cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/as-cases-spike-noida-identifies-7-clusters/articleshow/81768964.cms||Snehil Sinha

---||Nagpur||De-risking’ biz a priority to take on climate change||Nagpur: More than 70% of Maharashtra’s industrial sector believes that climate change is a real issue. Nearly half of them also agree that the crisis massively impacts industries and business. This was revealed in the latest research by environment organization Climate Trends. Recognising the importance of industry to the people and economy of the state, the group commissioned a baseline survey in over 400 large, medium and small-sized industries. Released recently during a discussion, the survey reveals a strong case and appetite for climate-smart business. While it establishes that more than 70% of state’s industrial sector believes that climate change is a real issue, 65% also rank ‘de-risking business from climate change’ as one of the top priorities for their business. “And to do that, they would prioritize reducing dependence on non-renewable resources, water harvesting, recycling and switching to renewable energy,” the research stated. In addition to this, industries also feel supported to fight against the changing climate landscape by the central government and industry associations. “Large industries have better access to technical advisory and expert support from the government,” the study stated. According to it, heavy rainfall, floods, cyclones, water shortage and rising temperature are seen as the main threats of climate change across industries and sectors. Some 37 percent of businesses claim that climate change is resulting in capital destruction and destruction of flora and fauna, which is leading to loss of business. “It is important that not just the larger companies but even the smaller companies really become aware of the fact that they are also impacting climate change and they need to make efforts. I think we need more and more disclosures as investors. We just can’t be investing into something which we are not even aware of,” said Aditya Agarwal, managing director, Morningstar, during the discussion. It was also highlighted that as countries plan their net-zero trajectory in the run-up to United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change’s (UNFCCC) Conference of Parties (COP26) to be held in Glasgow later this year, Indian businesses have the opportunity to include climate preparedness and rapid deep decarbonisation in their strategic thinking. Jennifer Austin, director of Strategy and Policy at UNFCCC’s COP high level champions for climate action, said, “Non-state actors, especially the business investors, are an important part of helping policymakers understand what the solutions are. By working collectively there’s an ability to do more. I think this survey has revealed that there is a strong and ever-growing awareness for climate action with a growing recognition worldwide.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/de-risking-biz-a-priority-to-take-on-climate-change/articleshow/81767697.cms||Manka Behl
---||Pune||Pune: Teenager abducted by sister-in-law’s kin, three held||PUNE: The Pune rural police on Tuesday morning rescued an 18-year-old boy from the clutches of his kidnappers, who were his sister-in-law’s relatives. The incident occurred in Kamshet on Monday evening. The woman had an inter-religion marriage with the boy’s elder brother against her relatives’ wishes, police said, adding that the newly-married couple works with an IT company. The police arrested three persons and impounded a car used in the alleged crime. The search is on for four persons, who escaped in another car after abandoning the victim unharmed at Dhanori. “The suspects include the woman’s brother. Prima facie probe revealed that the suspects kidnapped the youth as the couple’s cellphones were not reachable. They wanted to know the couple’s whereabouts and, hence, kidnapped the student,” senior inspector Padmakar Ghanwat of the Pune rural police’s local crime branch told TOI. “The teenager, who is the youngest of three brothers, had called his elder brother around 6.30pm on Monday to inform him that he had seen the suspects while he was on his way to the market in Kamshet. Suspecting danger, his brother rushed to the market on his motorcycle. He saw some men forcing his younger brother into a car. Two cars, including the one which had the boy, drove away towards Lonavla,” sub-inspector AY Pawar of the Kamshet police said. Pawar said the victim’s brother chased the two cars on his motorcycle. He then went home, informed his mother and alerted the police. He tried to contact his brother, but the suspects had snatched the victim’s cellphone. “We swiftly started nakabandi near the Varsoli toll plaza. But, the cars dashed through the barricades. We chased the cars and halted one of them with three persons in it. But, the car, which had the victim, sped away,” Pawar said. Ghanwat said his team checked the CCTV camera footage on the route and found that the car had gone in the direction of Pune. “We tracked the vehicle to Dhanori in Pune. When our team reached there, they found that the youth was abandoned there. We took him with us and handed him over to his relatives.” The police have registered a case for offences under Sections 364 (Kidnapping or abducting in order to murder), 394 (Voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery) and other relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/teenager-abducted-by-sister-in-laws-kin-3-held/articleshow/81766811.cms||Mihir Tanksale
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Some public hospitals keep relatives in Covid wards to manage patients||Mumbai: Bhandup resident S Mangni, 65, (name changed) was surprised when staffers at Mulund’s Covid jumbo hospital asked him to stay with his paralysed son in the Covid ward. His son could not walk or stand properly following a paralytic attack most likely triggered by the infection.“The hospital said they didn’t have enough manpower to look after patients in my son’s condition. I am old myself, how can I live in a Covid ward,” he said. Stumped by the request, the senior citizen turned to an employee who had accompanied him. But the man rebuffed him saying he couldn’t risk infecting his wife and children. The father was left to mull over his options. A Vikhroli family faced a similar situation when a nurse at BYL Nair Hospital told them that a family member had to stay with the patient, a 69-year-old man admitted after developing breathing difficulty. “The nurse said they can’t take care of everyone as load was immense,” the daughter said, adding they later shifted him to a private hospital.Demands to bring attendants, crowded halls, Indian toilets and unclean bathrooms are the likely reasons why affluent or middle-class patients prefer private beds despite the thousands of public ones lying vacant. Muskan Khanna said his 65-year-old father Jagdish had to be moved out of a jumbo facility as he couldn’t squat in an Indian toilet. “He said the toilets were dirty and overflowing often,” she said, adding even her younger brother admitted there desperately wanted to move out. “My brother found the doctors and nurses to be caring, but he couldn’t get himself to use the washrooms or toilets,” she said.In another case, a 52-year-old said his older sister, admitted at BKC Jumbo, had slipped and fallen near the bathroom, but nobody noticed till she gathered the strength to stand up. Another patient there corroborated that the bathroom floor would be perennially wet, causing patients to slip. “The treatment was great, but hygiene conditions need to improve,” the patient said.A source from Nair Hospital confirmed that relatives were told to stay back and take care of their own, while in some cases, relatives themselves volunteered. “Many of them would feed and bathe the patients and later sleep in the corridor outside the ward,” the doctor said. Dean Dr Ramesh Bharmal, however, said the practice was recently stopped. “We have deployed security guards now to see such incidents don’t occur,” he said.Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said it is not possible that relatives would be asked to stay in Covid wards. “However, we will check if such a request was made in any exceptional case,” he said, adding that public hospitals have treated 80% of Mumbai's Covid patients. Many civic doctors though confirmed that relatives have worn PPEs and stayed inside Covid wards since last year since public hospitals can't offer personalised care due to high volumes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-some-public-hospitals-keep-relatives-in-covid-wards-to-manage-patients/articleshow/81767693.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Lucknow||Wheat procurement set to start at 6,000 centres||Lucknow: Reiterating that his government was committed to provide adequate compensation to farmers for their produce, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday directed officials to put in place all measures for a seamless procurement of wheat from April 1. He was presiding over a review meeting at his official residence in Lucknow. The state government will be procuring wheat through 6,000 purchase centres. Yogi categorically directed officials to ensure availability of infrared thermometers and pulse oximeters at all purchase centres in the wake of a spike in the number of Covid cases in the state. Yogi said that his government has been procuring farmers’ produce at a minimum support price (MSP) since 2017. His stand gains significance in the light of prolonged stir by farmers who have been accusing the ruling BJP dispensation of bringing in new farm laws to do away with MSP. “The way farmers have been given the benefit of MSP in the last four years would continue in 2021-22,” Yogi said at the meeting, which was attended by senior officials, including chief secretary RK Tewari and agriculture production commissioner Alok Sinha. Yogi asked officials to ensure that farmers are not forced to wait to sell their produce at the purchase centres. At the same time, proper facilities like sitting arrangement and drinking water be made available to the farmers reaching the centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/wheat-procurement-set-to-start-at-6000-centres/articleshow/81768987.cms||---

---||Kochi||Rise in TPR raises concerns of Covid second wave in Kerala||KOCHI: Kerala after seeing a slight decline in Covid cases in mid-March, is now seeing a small spike in numbers. Test positivity rate (TPR) has increased and added with this is the Covid inappropriate behaviour during poll time. This has raised concerns among public health experts if this is the beginning of the second wave in state. In the first week of March, average cases per day in the state was 2,725 and TPR 4.5%. This came down to 2,036 average cases per day and TPR of 3.6% between March 6 and 13 and the subsequent week saw further decline with 1,839 average cases per day and TPR of 3.4%. However, there was a spike in cases between March 21 and 27, with 1,918 average cases per day and TPR of 3.8%. “After a dip in Covid numbers, now we see an increasing trend in Kerala. This indicates that it may be the start of a second wave in the state. Although it’s only a minor upward tick, looking at what is happening in other states we need to be extremely cautious. Following Covid-appropriate behavior and increasing pace of vaccination will slow down the pace of Covid spread for sure,” said Dr Shenoy Padmanabha, who has been analysing the Covid pattern across the country. All states are showing increase in cases, with Mahararastra leading with maximum cases with seven-day average daily growth rate of 1.3%, followed by Punjab at 1.2%, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat at 0.7% each and Chhattisgarh at 0.7%. The seven-day average daily growth rate of Kerala, that at one point was at the top position is now far behind with 0.2%. “Government is not enforcing stringent measures now, and due to this there is a lapse in ensuring Covid protocols not just in election campaigns and rallies but almost everywhere,” said Dr Jayakrishnan AV, chairman, Indian Medical Association’s (IMA) committee for vaccination promotion and coordination. Health department is aware of the risks and therefore they are trying to strengthen the vaccination drive in the state. “Had the elections happened during our peak it would have been a problem. But now we have an advantage here because of delay in peak as vaccine is available. Our aim is to cover another 50 lakh population below the age of 45 years before the second peak,” said Dr B Mohammed Asheel, executive director, Kerala Social Security Mission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/rise-in-tpr-raises-concerns-of-covid-second-wave-in-state/articleshow/81766823.cms||Preetu Nair

---||Pune||Temperature in city drops, 24 hrs after touching 40C||Pune: A day after the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) Lohegaon observatory recorded the day temperature at 40.1 degrees Celsius, the mercury dropped to 37.9Celsius on Tuesday. The day temperature recorded at the Shivajinagar observatory was 36.5Celsius. The temperature was 0.9 and 0.2Celsius below normal, respectively. On Monday, 40.1C was the highest day temperature recorded so far in the city. The Shivajinagar observatory had recorded 39.3C on the same day and the temperature was expected to remain at around the same level. The drop in the day temperature on Tuesday was significant in this context. Anupam Kashyapi, head of IMD Pune’s forecast division, said, “The wind pattern over Pune district caused the sudden fall in day temperature. Currently, northwesterly winds are coming from less warmer regions such as Gujarat and Kutch via Konkan over Madhya Maharashtra, which includes Pune. As a result, the temperature has fallen significantly on Tuesday. For the next 72 hours, Pune is likely to experience similar weather conditions.” “The intensity of heat particularly in the afternoon hours was severe owing to dry weather condition and clear sky. In the last few days, Puneites may have felt as if the temperature had risen to 40C because of this weather condition,” Kashyapi added. All weather stations in Vidarbha had recorded over 40C temperature for the first time this season. “Vidarbha has got heat wave warning for the next 72 hours and many of the stations would record temperature on higher note, mostly on the Thursday’s pattern,” said the official.

Daily demand for medical oxygen in Maharashtra has touched 700 metric tonnes (MT). During the first Covid peak in September 2020, daily requirement was around 500 MT. A notification capping medical use of oxygen at 80% was issued on Tuesday. The rule, in force till June 30, was issued under the Diseases Control Act, Disaster Management Act and Maharashtra Essential Services Act. Authorities said there is no shortage of oxygen, but districts in Marathwada and Vidarbha have been facing erratic supply due to time taken to deliver oxygen from plants in Pune and Thane. The state has 30 manufacturers and 88 refillers/distributors producing 1,287 MT of oxygen daily. Manufacturers have been instructed to boost output. The National Health Mission Commissioner and FDA commissioners have been appointed competent authorities to ensure implementation. DR Gahane, FDA joint commissioner, said: “Availability of tankers to carry oxygen is posing to be an issue.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-oxygen-manufacturers-told-to-reserve-80-of-total-supply-for-medical-use/articleshow/81767717.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Mumbai||Retd HC judge, Katy Baam, passes away in Mumbai||MUMBAI: The second woman judge of Bombay high court, Justice (retired) Katy Keki Baam, passed away on Tuesday, aged 80. She was a judge for 22 years. Her first appointment as judge was at the city civil and sessions court in Mumbai in March 1980. She was appointed permanent HC judge on October 6, 1994. Justice Baam had joined the bar when she was less than 24 years old, in 1964. She practiced across courts, including for criminal, civil, commercial, labour law and matrimonial cases. She went on to become the principal judge of city civil and sessions court in Mumbai before her elevation as Bombay high court judge, from where she retired on December 15, 2002. Post retirement, she was an arbitrator largely for commercial causes, money claims, family and testamentary disputes. A woman lawyer Manda Loke remembers appearing before Justice Baam as a fresh lawyer in 2000, dressed crisply in a “collared uniform’’. “I was in a black full sleeved dress with collar,’’ says Loke mourning the loss on Tuesday, but still remembering with a smile how the Judge cited her as an example to other lawyers present on proper court attire. Yet another lawyer recalled how she encouraged juniors in court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/retd-hc-judge-katy-baam-passes-away-in-mumbai/articleshow/81769028.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Lucknow||UP: BJP to name nominees for zila panchayat polls by April 1||LUCKNOW: After launching a campaign blitz for ensuing panchayat elections, BJP is set to announce names of party candidates for zila panchayat in next couple of days. Though election won’t be contested on party symbol, BJP has decided to field functionaries in 75 zila panchayats and 3,051 wards. Sources said, the party plans to announce names of candidates for the districts, which go to polls in first two phases by April 1. “We have begun the process of distribution of tickets after identifying candidates,” a senior UP BJP leader said. The nomination process for the first and second phase is scheduled on April 3 and April 7. Prominent districts which will go to polls in the first two phases include PM Narendra Modi’s parliamentary seat of Varanasi, CM Yogi’s home turf of Gorakhpur, SP stronghold of Azamgarh, besides a host of west UP districts which felt the ripples of farmers’ unrest against new farm laws. surces said, the candidate selection process would reflect the party’s inclusive approach vis-à-vis caste and community. “This will help the party prepare its ground for the assembly elections due next year,” a senior party functionary said. Sources said, the election of BJP functionaries in zila panchayat will help the party in taking various government schemes of the Centre and the state to rural areas and help consolidate its position at grassroots. Sources said, the process of deciding candidates would first be done at ward level, then at district level, followed by regional level before being sent to state headquarters for approval. BJP’s state executive meet held this month had mandated that party functionaries contesting panchayat elections would be required to resign from their posts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-to-name-nominees-for-zila-panchayat-polls-by-apr-1/articleshow/81769006.cms||Pankaj Shah

Police said that the victim was a resident of Patel Nagar. Initially, the victim’s family had suspected her fiancé from Madhya Pradesh to be behind it but it later turned out that the woman’s cousin in Delhi was sending the pictures. Her fiancé had lodged a complaint with the Madhya Pradesh police stating that his account was hacked and he did not leak any of her pictures. On Tuesday, a team of Madhya Pradesh police reached Delhi and arrested the accused. The minor girl had reported to Delhi Police in November last year that a man identified as Randeep sent her morphed obscene photos of hers on messenger in October and threatened to upload them if she did not marry him. The victim said that she had got engaged to Randeep in January but called off her engagement in September last year. A case under relevant sections was then registered. Later in January this year, the girl committed suicide. Randeep was then arrested and released on bail. Meanwhile, Randeep approached the Bhopal police and lodged a complaint of his Facebook account being hacked. It later turned out it was the girl’s cousin who was sending the pictures. A team of the Bhopal police then reached Delhi and arrested her cousin on Tuesday. Soon after the arrest was made by the MP police, family members staged a protest at Patel Nagar police station. The accused has been taken on transit remand by the MP police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/suicide-cousin-held-for-morphing-photos/articleshow/81767713.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Surgery helps woman ‘open’ her mouth||New Delhi: A 30-year-old woman, who could not open her mouth properly since birth due to a rare fusion of the jaw joint with the skull bone, underwent a successful surgery at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital recently. Astha Mongia’s mouth opening was so small that she couldn’t even touch her tongue with her hand, the hospital said in a statement. “In the last 30 years, she was unable to eat solid food and had difficulty speaking. She had lost almost all her teeth due to a dental infection,” it added. Doctors said the patient had a tumour on the right half of the face, orbit and forehead, making it “such a complicated case that various leading hospitals in India, the UK and Dubai refused a surgical solution”. Dr Rajeev Ahuja, senior plastic surgeon, SGRH, said: “For such patients to open their mouth, both the condyles (ball-like head of jaw joint) have to be removed. Often, a tongue-like bony extension in the front of the ball joint, known as coronoid process, also must be either removed or at least fractured. However, in Mongia’s case, the process was easier said than done because there were a bunch of vessels surrounding the coronoid process on the right side.” After the surgery, Mongia’s mouth opening has increased to three centimeters. A normal person has a mouth opening of four to six centimeters. “It is a miracle that I am able to open my mouth,” the hospital’s statement quoted Mongia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/surgery-helps-woman-open-her-mouth/articleshow/81767778.cms||---

As on Tuesday, the number of Covid-19 positive cases at IIM-A stood at 70, according to senior officials of the health department of the AMC. By Sunday, about 45 students, faculty members, and other staffers at the premier B-school had already tested positive. Over the past two days, about 25 more cases have been reported. According to the spokesperson of IIM-A, the institute was almost Covid-free with only isolated cases being reported till March 12. However, there was a significant rise in cases thereafter. “Micro-containment zones have already been defined wherever people have tested positive at the institute,” said Mehul Acharya, deputy health officer, AMC. “Consequently, the institute authorities formed a quarantine centre in Dorm 31, where all those who tested Covid-19 positive have been quarantined. Doctors on the campus in addition to teams from the civic body are regularly monitoring the health of all the patients at IIM-A.” According to IIM-A officials, most people who tested positive were asymptomatic. The cases were detected after RT-PCR tests were conducted by the institute. “Of the 70 people who have tested positive at IIM-A, 59 are under quarantine,” according to the Covid-19 dashboard on the institute’s website. “Some 43 students, one faculty member, and 15 staff members are under quarantine.” Since the cases began going up from March 12, the institute carried out 1,420 Covid-19 tests, which include RT-PCR tests and rapid antigen tests to help detect, isolate, and treat people. According to the institute’s officials, a safety protocol is being followed for visitors who enter the campus and also for those who come from outside Ahmedabad. “Typically, the student is made to shift to the quarantine facility within one hour and confirmation is obtained,” said the IIM-A spokesperson. “The quarantine facility has arrangements for food, medicines, and other necessities. The medical staff designated by the institute monitors the status of people multiple times daily.” Sources said that visitors’ entry to the campus has been restricted. Those coming to stay with students or faculty members from outside the campus are made to submit a self-declaration form and remain quarantined for a stipulated period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/number-of-covid-cases-at-iim-a-rises-to-70/articleshow/81767772.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Job fears colour Holi, migrants skip holiday||AHMEDABAD: Thousands of workers from Rajasthan employed in the restaurant and services sectors in Ahmedabad did not go home this year for Holi as they sensed the bleak hues of the pandemic in job insecurity and curbs. Usually every year, most eateries and restaurants are short-staffed around Holi, as migrants visit their home towns in Rajasthan. Dilip Thakkar, who runs two restaurants in Ahmedabad, said: “Most of our staff comes from Rajasthan and typically around Holi, at least 50% of our staffers tend to leave for their home towns.” Thakkar added: “They’re usually gone for a fortnight. However, this year for the first time, our staff is very much here. This is because some fear losing jobs.” Scores of people working as cooks or housekeeping or support staff at restaurants have lost jobs since the lockdown because the restaurant industry is reeling from a severe revenue shortfall. Order volumes have plunged and costs of operations have spiked. Restaurateurs said that many staffers have stayed back because of another deterrent: the mandatory negative RT-PCR report to enter Rajasthan. “Every year on Holi and Diwali, staffers usually leave for at least a week. However, this time people are scared of losing jobs or getting stuck due to lockdowns,” said Kishan Bhavani, another restaurateur. “Moreover, taking an RT-PCR test is a costly affair for them. They’re also scared of testing positive and being put in institutional quarantine.” Many migrants from Rajasthan are also employed as domestic help at Ahmedabad households. “Our house help is invariably with us through most festivals, but he tends to take a week or two off around Holi,” said Alpesh Shah, a Vejalpur resident. “However, this is for the first time that he hasn’t taken a break because he cannot afford an RT-PCR test and finds travelling a bit risky.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/job-fears-colour-holi-migrants-skip-holiday/articleshow/81767758.cms||---
---||Pune||2.17 applications for 96k RTE seats in state, Pune district leads||Pune: The state school education department has received 2.17 lakh applications for 96,000 seats available in schools under the Right to Education Act’s 25% reserved quota. In Pune 54,000 applications have been received for 14,000 seats. Tuesday was the last day to fill up the forms online for taking part in the centralised admission process for the 25% seats in the entry-level classes in unaided schools in the state. Education activist Mukund Kirdat said this year the Pune Municipal Corporation’s elected members and their workers helped people in their constituencies to fill up the form. “There is still a lot to be done for smaller districts but the response in the cities, especially n Pune is very good. But, many schools have boycotted the process this year due to non-payment of reimbursement and there needs to be a long term solution for this. Secondly, if the online classes continue, the government needs to find a way to address the learning gap between regular students and RTE students because of the lack of resources. Thirdly, many schools have standard I as their entry-level instead of the nursery which means there will already be a learning gap when the RTE student comes to standard I as against a regular student who has had three years of pre-primary education,” Kirdat said. Nandkumar Kakirde, director of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan group of schools, said the government should start considering amending the RTE Act to include reimbursement from pre-primary classes itself because the New Education Policy of the country also takes the pre-primary education into consideration. “Our schools are giving admission from nursery despite getting no compensation because it will be hard for students to cope with the syllabus if they are directly admitted in standard I. We are yet to get reimbursement for the last five years from the government and on top of it, many parents from the regular batch have also not paid the tuition fees for their wards. Due to this, we are facing a financial crunch with our losses going up to Rs 2 crore for the financial year,” Kakirde said.

---||Kochi||Public sentiment favours another term for LDF govt||BJP is not only dividing the country on religious grounds but also playing caste politics, said CPI general secretary D Raja. In an interview with TOI he said BJP is hoping to make inroads in Kerala by taking the names of Ayyankali and Sree Narayana Guru. Q. Who do you think will fare better in elections? A: Going by the mood of Keralites and the desperation seen in BJP and UDF camps, I feel LDF will win return to power. The way Narendra Modi & Amit Shah are campaigning, it shows they are very worried. Q. What about the UDF? A: UDF lacks vision. Also, I don’t understand Rahul Gandhi’s politics. He says Pinarayi Vijayan wants to drive a car without fuel. I would say that Vijayan has the will to take the state forward. If there is no fuel, it is not his problem alone but of the entire nation. Indian economy, GDP is down and there is unprecedented unemployment now. Q. Congress is your ally in other states, but Rahul always attacks LDF? A: When Rahul comes for  campaigns, he doesn’t attack BJP. It seems UDF is not interested in exposing BJP but attacking LDF. LDF is seeking a mandate on the basis of its performance. During floods or Covid-19 crisis, LDF regime did a good job of rescuing, rehabilitating people. Nobody went hungry, ration was delivered to families. It did whatever it could with available resources. What has Centre done? It is only undermining federal structure of the Constitution. Q. Kerala is the last Left bastion. Is it a do-or-die situation? A: I don’t agree it is the last. It is the first party that broke the single-party rule in India. Let’s see what happens in the next few days. In Hyderabad after mayor elections, BJP declared that it is the gateway to the south. They don’t have a foothold in Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Q. Will Left play a key role at the national level? A: Left is the only hope for the people of India. Our politics & ideology have acceptance among the youth. We do have problems with certain electoral performance. In some states, we have been able to bridge that performance gap but in north India, we do have a problem. One should not think Kerala is the last bastion. People who say that the Left has no future should worry as it means that the country has no future. Q. Will current elections change the political scenario in India? A: I believe there is a political churning happening across the country. What we tell the people will be the focal point; we must unite all secular, democratic forces. India is a secular and welfare state. But BJP is bent on dividing people in the name of religion, culture and god. Q. You mentioned a political churning? A: We are heading for a new alignment of secular, democratic forces based on committed ideological and political views. India saw it for the first time under VP Singh. There will be another huge political churning in the coming days. Left will play a key role and this churning will lead to emergence of a new alignment that is committed to constitutional morality and social harmony. Q. One of the points being raised by BJP is minority appeasement. Isn’t the Left is doing the same for political gains? A: India has tremendous diversity that BJP does not recognize. If we talk about fundamentalism, CPI is opposed to Hindu and Muslim fundamentalism. BJP is trying to make India a theocratic state Q. What will secular parties do? A: BJP will not succeed. In UP, crimes against women, dalits and minorities have increased. They claim that they are a Hindu nation. But, Indians are largely secular and will not tolerate it. Already, the rumblings have begun. Q. Do you think BJP’s hardline Hindutva is impractical in Kerala? A: Yes. Their efforts will not succeed in the land of Ayyankali and Narayana Guru. They laid the foundation for what Kerala is today. Similarly, in TN, they don’t talk about Hindutva because of Iyothee Thass, who fought for dalit rights there, and Periyar who fought for social justice. BJP is promoting subaltern Hindutva in TN. BJP is talking of ‘Vikasanam and puthiya Keralam’ but when India has not prospered under BJP, how can Kerala?||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/public-sentiment-favours-another-term-for-ldf-govt/articleshow/81767751.cms||---
---||Kochi||Sandeep’s lawyer denies filing complaint againt ED||Kochi: P V Vijayam, the lawyer of gold smuggling case accused Sandeep Nair, denied reports that Sandeep filed a complaint with crime branch (CB) against the enforcement directorate (ED) through his lawyer. She said it was false that crime branch registered a case against ED based on Nair’s petition, submitted by his lawyer to the state police chief. She said she is the sole lawyer who represents Nair in the cases and neither she nor Nair’s family has any idea about such a petition. Meanwhile, NIA court in Kochi granted pardon to Nair and four other accused persons — Anwar, Musthafa, Aseez and Nandagopal — in the gold smuggling case on Tuesday after they turned approvers. The court also granted statutory bail to Nair as the National Investigation Agency could not file the chargesheet against him in the case. Nair is yet to get bail in the ED’s case and is currently detained under Cofeposa in the customs case. Crime branch on Monday registered a second case against ED officers for coercing Nair into naming chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan in the gold smuggling case. There were reports that CB registered the case against ED after a lawyer representing Sandeep approached the state police chief and filed a complaint about ED’s coercion. Vijayam told TOI that she had not met with the state police chief or given any complaint to CB. “I saw the reports that crime branch registered a case based on complaints of Sandeep’s lawyer, but it is not true. We have not given any such complaint. I represent Sandeep in all cases and there is no other lawyer for him. Even Sandeep or his family is not aware of any other lawyer or such complaint. I don’t know the lawyer named Sunil, who was said to have given the complaint, based on whose complaint the case was registered. I will be approaching the crime branch to seek more details of the new case,” Vijayam said. Initially, Nair had not appointed any lawyer after getting arrested in the case. Later, Kerala legal service authority (KELSA) appointed Vijayam to represent him in the cases registered by customs, ED and NIA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/sandeeps-lawyer-denies-filing-complaint-againt-ed/articleshow/81766832.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The state has surpassed its quota of 25.25 crore man days of labour by providing 25.43 crore work days. This, following the constant monitoring of the panchayat raj department by chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy to provide employment to scores of daily wage workers who had been struggling as a result of the pandemic. “As much as Rs 5,818 crore has been spent on wages to workers over the last one year. This is the highest ever in the history of the state,” panchayat raj minister Peddireddy Ramachandra Reddy said on Monday. He added that they were expecting to cross 26 crore man days of employment within the next two days. The minister said the chief minister had directed officials to provide employment to all those who wanted to work under National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS) while following Covid-19 guidelines. The minister said the CM had asked officials to focus on migrant workers to ensure that no one was left hungry. He said they have taken up works worth Rs 10,170 crore through NREGS for which Rs 5,818 crore was spent exclusively on wages to workers. He said that Rs 3,965 crore were spent on skilled wages and material component. “The department has granted work to a whopping 54 lakh people in a single day on June 9, 2020 following the advice of the chief minister,” said Peddireddy. The minister said the chief minister’s vision had helped the state create assets worth Rs 9,871 crore. He said they had constructed permanent buildings for village secretariats, Rythu Bharosa Kendras, bulk milk chilling units (BMCU), Anganwadi centres, YSR clinics besides roads and drains. He said that they have constructed close to 50,000 buildings by synchronising NREGS.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ap-sets-new-record-for-providing-jobs-to-poor/articleshow/81748619.cms||Samdani MN

D Stalin, who is also the director of Vanashakti NGO, said a petition to declare Panje wetland a wildlife santuary has also been filed in the court. “Authorities, like Cidco, are not cooperating in our effort to ensure that this wetland, which attracts scores of birds, including flamingos, survives. The Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) is also not attending our panel meetings regularly. Hence, I feel that the state environment minister or the CMO must urgently intervene to save Panje,” said Stalin. Stalin also pointed out that he has written a fresh complaint to the forest department about another CRZ-1 area in Ulwe (Latitude 19.00 and Longitude 74.04) which is being destroyed because of dumping of debris. While exprerssing similar concern, the director of NatConnect Foundation, B N Kumar, said, “We too have been continuously writing to the government departments in order to save Panje in Uran taluka, but there is very little progress from the government’s end. This, we suspect, is because some of the officials may have some vested interest in ensuring that Panje is fully destroyed so that towers can come up there. The courts or the CMO must intervene.” “Cidco has a 26% stake in NMSEZ, and has allotted mangrove zones and wetlands to various projects. It has even leased out the Panje holding pond, part of a flood control mechanism, to NMSEZ. The planner has now usurped the pond and earmarked it as sectors 16 to 28 in the upcoming Dronagiri Development Plan,” Kumar alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/cmo-or-forest-min-must-intervene-to-save-panje-wetland-before-its-too-late-in-mumbai/articleshow/81769073.cms||Vijay Singh

Five persons including two cops — police sub-inspector (PSI) Ramesh Gangal and constable Rajesh Rathod — were booked in connection with the gangster’s escape from custody. The complaint was at Bhuj B Division police station by PSI Sahdev Chauhan, police headquarters, Bhuj. While Gangal and Rathod were booked for negligence, Donga was charged for escaping from police custody. One man identified as Bharat and an unidentified person was booked for helping the gangster escape from custody. Donga, a historysheeter, was lodged in Bhuj’s Palara jail since October last year after he was found having ‘dinner’ with is aides inside Gondal sub-jail in Rajkot district. On Saturday, Donga was brought to G K General Hospital after he complained of chest pain. At around 1.18 am on Monday, when the cops accompanying Donga — Gagal and Rathod — were asleep, the gangster escaped from the hospital prison ward. Investigation revealed that a man named Bharat was already waiting outside the hospital with a car. Both Donga and Bharat fled in the car which was driven by the unidentified accused, said police. Gangal and Rathod were immediately booked for being lax on duty, said police. According to police, Donga was running an extortion racket from inside Gondal jail.

He refused to relent even when his mother tried convincing him again. “As Shiyal refused to listen, Dudhi called Baraiya for help as her daughter-in-law Parvati had gone to her parents’ house with two children for Dhuleti. Baraiya also tried talking to Shiyal. However, he retaliated,” said police. Seeing her daughter get extremely irritated, Dudhi grabbed Savji.

After the bus ride, the SP chief announced that UPSRTC will be provided with world class buses once the SP government is formed in the state after the 2022 assembly polls. The former UP CM and his family were heading for Safai to celebrate Holi at SP founder Mulayam Singh Yadav’s residence – a tradition that the Yadav clan has been following for decades now – when Akhilesh decided to get on to a UPSRTC bus when his motorcade was a few kilometres from Kannauj. Akhilesh got on to a bus with his two daughters Aditi and Tina. The family interacted with the passengers during which the SP chief sought feedback of the bus services in UP first hand. The family got off when the bus stopped at Taal village in Kannauj and got back into the car for the onward journey. After getting off the bus Akhilesh said once the SP government is formed in UP the condemned vehicles, which have completed their mileage on road, will be phased out in a systematic manner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/akhilesh-takes-bus-ride-along-with-daughters/articleshow/81769080.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

Maharashtra conducted close to 1.3 lakh tests on Monday, down from the 1.5-1.7 lakh tests it was doing last week. Reporting a 21% positivity rate , the state has added 27,918 new cases and 139 deaths. With this, total caseload climbed to 27.7 lakh and fatalities rose to 54,422. BMC, for its part, conducted over 40,000 tests daily between March 23 and 28, leading to detections in the 5,000-6,900 range daily. However, on March 28 and 29, 33,966 and 24,464 tests were performed respectively. This resulted in 5,890 detections on Monday and 4,760 on Tuesday. The city's overall tally has now crossed 4 lakh since March last year, with 11,675 deaths. Active cases have risen to 47,742. BMC commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal on Tuesday said by early next week over 60,000 tests would be performed daily. He also said that bed capacity would be increased from 13,000-odd to 17,000 in a week. Public health minister Rajesh Tope said he has been informed that deaths are being reported among young patients in certain districts as they are reporting late to hospitals and not monitoring themselves while in home isolation. “Patients are seen not to follow all the protocols while in home isolation and are reporting to hospitals very late with dropped oxygen levels," said Tope.Mumbai Metropolitan Region reported 8,807 cases and 21 deaths on Tuesday, taking total caseload to 8.8 lakh cases and 20,254 deaths.

---||Kozhikode||Kerala elections: We want equality, not sympathy, says Anannyah Kumari Alex||Anannyah Kumari Alex (28) is the first transgender person to run for the assembly elections in the state. Hailing from Perumon in Kollam, Anannyah has overcome a lot ever since she came out in 2011. Anannyah, who is the first transgender radio jockey in the state, is also a model, news presenter, anchor, make-up artist and a resource person on gender issues. TOI caught up with her during her busy campaign schedule in Vengara constituency. Excerpts:Your candidature is a historic step not only for transgender community but in the election history of Kerala. How are people responding to you when you go to them seeking votes?I am not from Malappuram or Malabar, but I am proud and happy to be here. My experience has been positive; the campaign is, however, challenging as well. People here are very down to earth and in the villages many don’t even know the existence of transgender people. Some ask me directly and to some others I explain what I am. Overall, I have been coming across only happy faces in the constituency. Being a candidate you have to reach out to people. Many in Kerala, still are uncomfortable seeing transgender persons in public. How should the perception change?In Vengara, people don’t know that transgender persons exists. That is not their fault, the world only talks about men and women. For the perception to change, people should stop ‘holding us close’ as they like to say. We don’t want anyone’s sympathy. What we want is equality. People who have a voice in the society should start to say male, female and transgender equality whenever they talk about equality. It is not right to refer to transgender equality only when you are talking about transgender community. Some on the other hand knows exactly what a transgender person is, but are not ready to accept them. My Pappa has accepted me but my mother who gave birth to me still can’t accept me and I can’t do anything to change her mind. What we can do is to provide awareness to change their perception. You are representing Democratic Social Justice Party (DSJP). Why the party and what are your plans for the people of Vengara?I went to a house in Vengara the other day and a mother came out wearing her prayer dress. She was in tears when she told me that there was no permanent arrangement for her to get drinking water. Even when the ruling party claims that they have done a lot, such people still exist. Why were they left out? If I am elected, issues like the ones faced by that mother would be the first I would fix. DSJP stands with the motto that there is no religion, caste or gender for poverty. I am representing a marginalized community and the party intends to give representation to such communities. It is my belief that the party is centred on the idea that everyone should receive equal opportunities above gender, caste and religious barriers and this belief led me to run on their ticket. Your candidature would be an inspiration for more transgender persons to turn to public service. There are, however, only 290 persons under the category of ‘third gender’ in Kerala. Why do you think the number is so low?One issue is technical as many prefer to identify in their chosen gender and their identification records would have male and female listed in it. The other is the fact that many transgender persons refuse to list themselves in the electoral roll fearing social stigma. I do think that we need to get our identity on record so as to show our strength in numbers but that is of course an individual choice. The Transgender Persons Act, 2019 is severely criticised for being discriminatory and for violating the basic rights of transgender persons. What can be done to prevent such laws in the future?I have taken part in several protests against this law even when it was in the bill stage. They passed it without any care. The law is a blatant violation of human rights. It is high time that at least a seat or two is reserved for transgender community in Parliament. I am contesting the elections as a citizen and more people from the community have to come forward and fight for that seat. I believe that the presence of at least one transgender MP would make a difference when such laws are tabled. Kerala was the first state to introduce a transgender policy. What more can be done to provide sustainable assistance to the community members?To find a permanent solution to the crisis that the community face, transgender persons should be given reservation in PSC vacancies. Jobs to transgender people was one of the highlights of Kochi Metro, which made it popular. All of them, however, were employed in housekeeping, irrespective of their qualifications. Accommodation was not provided and many faced discrimination. Though the job profiles of some were changed subsequently, many left the job. Now, only around 10 transgender persons work there. The state government did indeed do a lot for the community. However, creating a working space with acceptance is an important step. The same goes for private sector, more companies should become open to hiring transgender persons. It is a popular opinion within the transgender community that the state police are hostile towards the community. What is your take on this?The police need to change. Providing awareness is not on the table any more. The force is one group of officials who get the maximum number of awareness classes. But they are not changing. So, stringent penal action against them for their offences is the only solution. It is high time the force learned to give respect and take respect.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/we-want-equality-not-sympathy/articleshow/81767798.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Maha minister, forest unions up ante against Reddy, want him booked as co-accused||Nagpur: After political parties, human rights bodies, social organizations, and forest employees upped the ante against APCCF MS Reddy, the state government is likely to take action against the senior IFS officer on Wednesday. “The suspension order is ready and it can come at any moment from the chief minister’s office (CMO). We are waiting for chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s approval,” said forest ministry sources. However, till late night the order was not issued. Vikas Kharge, principal secretary to chief minister, did not respond to calls by TOI. According to top sources, the state government gave a safe exit to Reddy by transferring him to Nagpur. Reddy has already completed over 3 years in Melghat as field director. “Yet, the clarification by Reddy to the government on March 27 mentioning that his transfer needs to be reviewed as it is against the principle of natural justice, did not augur well with those in power. There are three posts of APCCF lying vacant at Nagpur and Reddy was to be posted on any one of them,” said top sources. “The audio clip in which the accused Shivkumar is abusing RFO Chavan is also disturbing and unacceptable and shows the officer’s true face. All this could have been avoided,” say top sources. All foresters associations and unions on Tuesday vociferously demanded Reddy’s suspension, making him a co-accused in the Harisal RFO Deepali Chavan suicide case. Deepali’s husband Rajesh Mohite too has filed a police complaint in this regard with Dharni police. A section of media from Amravati even reported about Reddy’s suspension on Tuesday after women and child development minister and Amravati guardian minister Yashomati Thakur called on chief minister Uddhav Thackeray demanding the suspension of the top IFS officer. “Had the senior IFS officer acted well in time against Shivkumar, the RFO’s life could have been saved,” said Thakur. Earlier in the day, there was high drama in Melghat field director’s office at Amravati with Beldar Samaj and BJP leaders grilled forest officials and forced them to talk to PCCF (HoFF) G Saiprakash demanding assurance for action against Reddy. At Nagpur too, Saiprakash was given representations by Forest Rangers Association Maharashtra (FRAM), All India Range Forest Officers Federation (AIRFOF), an apex body of rangers at national level. “Reddy cannot wash his hands off the issue that he did not know about it as there were no written complaints. When RFO Chavan had opposed about it orally, the facts should have been probed,” said Sanjay Mendhe, publicity chief of the AIRFOF. Several associations demanded removal of accused IFS officer Shivkumar from forest service, and make Reddy a co-accused in the crime for abetting RFO Chavan’s suicide by not taking any action against the accused DyCF, and not granting leaves and salary to the deceased. These associations in separate memorandums to the state government through PCCF (HoFF) G Saiprakash demanded to an SIT under senior woman IPS officer and book those who were directly and indirectly involved. “If no action is taken, FRAM and other associations have threatened to launch stir from April 2,” said NR Gawande and KV Bolke, FRAM secretary and president, respectively. Subhash Dongre, president of Maharashtra State Gazetted Forest Officers Association, Nagpur, too made similar demand in a memorandum. Meanwhile, Deepali suicide case has dented the image of IFS officers in Maharashtra. The sensational suicide case has spread to other states with forest rangers association in Madhya Pradesh, Tripura, Andhra Pradesh, and other states will sport black ribbons and keep silent for a minute on Wednesday. Shivkumar gets 14 days MCR The suspended deputy conservator of forest (DyCF) Vinod Shivkumar (33) on Tuesday was remanded in magisterial custody remand (MCR) by a Dharni court in Deepali Chavan suicide case. According to investigating officer (IO) Vilas Kulkarni, the accused’s PCR ended on Monday. The accused was again granted a day’s PCR till Tuesday. “Today the court sent the accused to 14-day MCR. He is not cooperating with the police in investigations and did not reveal much,” said Kulkarni. Police also searched his office in Chikhaldara. The IFS officer is charged with verbally abusing Deepali and physically, mentally, and economically torturing her over petty issues forcing her to take the extreme step.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/maha-minister-forest-unions-up-ante-against-reddy-want-him-booked-as-co-accused/articleshow/81767831.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Delhi||Three forest teams to deal with man-animal conflict||New Delhi: Delhi forest department will constitute three rapid response teams in three divisions to deal with man-animal conflicts. As the forest department currently does not have a professional animal handling unit and is dependent on NGOs for rescue operations, Ridge Management Board has cleared the appointment of specialised staff for handling injured or stranded animals. Each team will have five members for attending to animal rescue operations. “A proposal has been approved for hiring 15 people who are specialised in animal handling, especially injured or stranded animals like monkeys, nilgais and snakes. A team member will be given a monthly remuneration of Rs 25,000,” said a forest official. He added these three rapid response teams would cater to three forest divisions—South, North and West. Each team will work under a divisional conservator of forest. The annual budget for rapid response teams will be around Rs 45 lakh. “The ridge area is home to the major wildlife population of Delhi. The Northern, Central and Western Ridges are characterised by the presence of small mammals like Common Mongoose, Small Indian Mongoose, Palm Squirrel, Rufous Tailed Hare, Rhesus Monkey, etc. The area also harbours a variety of reptiles like Common Skink, Monitor Lizard, Garden Lizard, Fan-throated Lizard, Yellow bellied House Gecko, Spectacled Cobra, Common Krait, Wolf Snake, Rat Snake, Common Sandboa, Saw-scaled Viper, etc. Wildlife species primarily getting involved in man-animal interface situations are snakes and nilgais. Wildlife also gets injured on coming in contact with man-made structures in settlements through incidents like electrocution, etc, especially species like monkeys and raptor birds. Presently, the department takes help of NGOs in managing conflict situations, which leads to delays,” it was stated during Ridge Management Board’s meeting. Delhi has reported a few cases in the past when the rescue operation was stretched to many days due to shortage of specialised staff. In January this year, a nilgai, which had strayed into a park situated in the back side of Old Fort, was rescued by a team of the forest department after a gap of over a month. According to the forest department, maximum cases of conflict are reported during the monsoon season due to rise in sightings of snakes. Most snake species are burrowing reptiles and spend time underground and hence, they are forced to seek shelter on higher ground when their homes get destroyed due to flooding, said experts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/three-forest-teams-to-deal-with-man-animal-conflict/articleshow/81767801.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Kochi||‘Probe amounts to fabricating proof’||Kochi: Kerala Police continuing with the investigation against Enforcement Directorate (ED) amounts to fabricating evidence, solicitor general Tushar Mehta has contended before the high court while seeking a stay on the investigation. The court will consider the plea on Wednesday. The submission was made by the solicitor general on behalf of ED during the hearing on a petition filed by P Radhakrishnan, deputy director of ED Kochi zone, challenging the FIR filed by crime branch wing of Kerala Police.  It is alleged in the FIR that ED officials forced gold smuggling accused Swapna Suresh to name the chief minister to be involved in the smuggling operation. When the case was heard by Justice VG Arun during the morning session on Tuesday, the solicitor general said ED is filing a short affidavit praying for a stay on the investigation. After referring to the court’s directive not to take any coercive steps against ED officials, the solicitor general said the police are continuing with the investigation which amounts to fabricating evidence. Till the court decides, let them not do that. “We are before the highest court of the state. One is the central agency, another is a state agency. We must be fair to each other and above all, we must be fair to the honourable court,” he said. The court suggested that a detailed hearing can be had at 2pm. However, one of the senior counsels requested for postponing the hearing to Wednesday, which was agreed to by the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/probe-amounts-to-fabricating-proof/articleshow/81766844.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: After warmest March day since 1945, a stormy relief||NEW DELHI: With the mercury crossing 41 degrees in parts of Delhi on Monday, the capital recorded its warmest March day in 76 years. At 40.1 degrees Celsius, Safdarjung, Delhi’s base station, recorded the warmest day in March since March 31, 1945, when mercury had touched 40.5 degrees Celsius, India Meteorological Department (IMD) said. Met officials said that a ‘severe heatwave’ was prevalent across Delhi-NCR on Holi day and the maximum temperature was 8 degrees above normal for this time of the season. Tuesday was, however, relatively cooler with strong winds and a dust storm bringing the maximum temperature down to 37.9 degrees Celsius. Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist at IMD, said, while they had forecast a maximum of around 38 degrees Celsius for Holi, clear skies and calm wind conditions saw the maximum crossing 40 degrees in most parts of the capital. “A severe heatwave was recorded across a number of places in the northern plains on Monday, including Delhi. This was the warmest March day in 76 years,” said Srivastava. Met officials said that strong winds of up to 45km/hr were recorded on Tuesday. “While they may drop slightly on Wednesday, they are once again expected to be around 40-45km/hr on Thursday. This will provide a cooling effect, bringing the maximum down in the city by a few degrees,” said Srivastava. For Safdarjung, the highest maximum in March before Monday was on March 29, 1973, when it was 39.6 degrees Celsius. Prior to that, the highest maximum recorded in March was on March 31, 1945, when it touched 40.5 degrees, IMD data shows. While Safdarjung was hot, other parts of Delhi were even hotter. Najafgarh recorded a maximum of 41.8 degrees Celsius on Monday, followed by Narela at 41.7 degrees Celsius. Pitampura and Pusa had highs of 41.6 and 41.5 degrees Celsius, respectively. The maximum in Noida and Gurgaon also crossed the 40-degree mark with a high of 40.7 in Gurgaon and 40.1 in Noida. Delhi’s minimum temperature was three degrees above normal on Monday at 20.6 degrees Celsius. Najafgarh also recorded the highest minimum temperature on Monday—26.2 degrees Celsius. Tuesday’s dust storm meant Delhi’s air was in the ‘poor’ category with an overall Air Quality Index (AQI) of 232. Agencies say while ventilation has improved, coarse dust particles are also travelling towards the capital now, which may lead to an increase in AQI. “Better ventilation is forecast, however, an increase in coarse dust contribution and suspended particles is expected due to the dust-raising winds. The chance for significant long-range transport of dust from the arid region for a short period also exists,” said SAFAR, a body under the ministry of earth sciences.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/after-warmest-march-day-since-1945-a-stormy-relief/articleshow/81767836.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

According to the district administration records, there are around 25,000 licensed firearm owners in the district. The elections in Agra district will take place in the first phase on April 15 and the nomination process for which will start on April 3. With just a fortnight left to the polling, candidates have started door-to-door campaigns in villages and have been also holding meetings with locals. On February 25, additional district magistrate and incharge of district armament Prabhakant Awasthi had ordered police and authorised arm dealers to collect licensed firearms. However, even after a month, only nearly 30% (7,800) of owners have deposited their firearms. The ADM said, “All licensed firearm holders must deposit their weapons at local police stations or with authorised arms dealers. Besides, police have been directed to ensure that all licensed weapons are deposited. Action will be taken against those who fail to deposit their arms by end of this week.” Meanwhile, police are identifying candidates with criminal cases, such as the charges of murder and rioting pending against them, having licensed firearms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/panchayat-polls-70-of-owners-yet-to-deposit-licensed-firearms-adm-warns-of-legal-action/articleshow/81766849.cms||Deepak Lavania

Customs had earlier asked her to appear in its Kochi office on Tuesday at 10am but she failed to appear. Customs sources said that a decision will be taken soon about what the next step would be as she skipped the interrogation again. Customs can move the court seeking issuance of a warrant against Vinodini as she skipped interrogation even after three notices. Customs decided to question Vinodini after the agency traced the IMEI number of one of the six iPhones, given by Unitac MD Santhosh Eappen to gold smuggling case accused Swapna Suresh, to a SIM card reportedly registered in Vinodini’s name. The SIM card was found to have been used in the phone and Vinodini was summoned to get clarity on it. Customs sources said more high-profile people are likely to be summoned for questioning in connection with cases linked to the gold smuggling. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/vinodini-skips-third-customs-summons-too/articleshow/81766861.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Sources said that Hiran handed over the keys the same day to Waze at his office at the city police headquarters.

Officials are also probing if any of his senior officers had knowledge of the conspiracy. Meanwhile, the NIA on Tuesday recovered a Mitsubishi Outlander which was found abandoned in Kalamboli two days before Waze’s arrest. This car is registered in Waze’s name. This is the sixth high-end car recovered by the NIA in the case so far, and they are still looking for an Audi and a Skoda which Waze were using. The NIA is likely to take custody of CCTV footage of the Mumbai police headquarters on Wednesday. The ATS had written to the Mumbai police early this month to preserve the custody of the CCTV footage of 45 days, from February onwards. The investigators want to know the set of people who came to meet Waze during this period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/wazes-driver-left-gelatin-laden-suv-near-ambanis-home-nia/articleshow/81769742.cms||Ahmed Ali

The fire fanned by a wind and dry weather spread rapidly, completely destroying the standing wheat crop, claimed Tabish Khan who owns six bigha of farm land, Ubaish Khan three bigha and Navi Sher who has four bigha of land. They said their wheat was not covered under any crop insurance scheme. They alleged the power department had turned a deaf ear to their repeated complaints about loose electricity wiring points and the hazard posed to their crops. The trio claimed the fire brigade was informed immediately but they arrived late. By that time, locals helped to douse the fire. Had they depended on the fire brigade, the fire would have spread to a vast area, causing extensive damage. Ram Das. SDM of Amaria tehsil circle, said the area lekhpal would be sent to the spot to assess crop damage for consideration of reparation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/spark-from-electric-cable-joint-destroys-13-bigha-of-standing-crop-in-pilibhit/articleshow/81765711.cms||Keshav Agarwal
---||Amritsar||Paddy to wheat, no retreat||BATHINDA: Six months on, the farmers’ struggle continues from paddy to wheat harvesting season. Even 11 rounds of talks couldn’t bring them back to fields. Their campaign against the corporate world has moved from half-yearly stocktaking on September 30 to March 31 annual performance audit. The farmers see World Trade Organisation (WTO), International Monetary Fund (IMF), and World Bank behind the Centres’ agri-marketing laws. The bills got through a heated debate in the Rajya Sabha on September 20 and Presidential approval on September 27, but on October 1, 2020, 30 farmer unions occupied railway tracks, toll plazas, corporate outlets, and refueling stations in protest, besides cordoning the homes of senior members of the Punjab BJP, a thing which is on for 180 days. The tracks were vacated but the hijacking of the toll plazas has cost the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) Rs 550 crore, so far. NHAI regional officer R P Singh said: “Punjab’s 25 national highway toll plazas are free for the past six months. Barring only a couple, those in Haryana are free, too, and our losses are mounting.” Besides Ambani and Adani, Vedanta and L&T (Larsen and Toubro) also had their property and business assets destroyed in Punjab, while the BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan) blocked coal supplies to the thermal-electricity plants of these corporate houses. The latest in its line of fire is the Adani dry port at Kila Raipur in Ludhiana district. The farmer unions claim to have lost 300 comrades in these six months of protest. BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokri Kalan said: “We have stopped counting the months. We survived zero temperature and we’ll survive the 45-degree-Celsius heat, too, but not retreat until victory and the repeal of three laws. The government is free to test our patience. Like paddy harvesting, we have arrangements for wheat harvesting, too.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/paddy-to-wheat-no-retreat/articleshow/81767852.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Agra||UP: Former Army man, 70, kin, 80, get life 42 years after murder of 4||AGRA: More than 40 years after four of a family were killed over a land dispute, a former Army personnel was among two sentenced to life imprisonment for the crime. “Given the evidence and circumstances of the case, punishing the accused Niranjan Singh and Rajendra Singh is warranted and necessary to establish social justice,” the order by additional district and sessions judge Sudhir Kumar on March 17 said, sentencing former Army personnel Rajendra and his relative Niranjan to life imprisonment and imposing a fine of Rs 75,000 each. “Rajendra had a Ladakh posting and was home on leave at the time. He is 70 now and retired as an Army personnel,” additional district government counsel Pradeep Sharma told TOI. Niranjan is 80. The case goes back to May 13, 1979. Rajendra, Niranjan, another Army personnel Ranveer Singh, Narendra and Pratap were engaged in a land dispute with another family in the village of Basarai Chahr in Fatehpur Sikri. “Atar Singh and his son Pinki, 20 at the time, were asleep on a cot in their farm when Rajendra, armed with a double-barrelled gun, and Pratap, also armed, attacked them,” Maharaj, Atar Singh’s son, said. “Rajendra, Pratap and Niranjan held my father and brother. Niranjan stabbed both of them with a knife and then shot them dead. They tried to kill me too but I managed to flee … Then, they went to my house, shot my cousin Viri Singh, his mother Harpyari and aunt Matari. Viri was injured, but the two others died right there.” An FIR was lodged against all five at the Fatehpur Sikri police station. The charges were murder, attempt to murder and rioting. The case, however, dragged on. On March 28, 1985, Ranveer was acquitted. He had an alibi — he had produced six colleagues as witnesses and documents to show he was not in the village at the time of the murders. The others, meanwhile, were on the run — for 29 years. “They were absconding since the charge sheet was filed in court,” Sharma said. “Finally, in 2008, they surrendered before the chief judicial magistrate’s court in Agra after the government attached their houses and properties. After they spent two and a half years in Agra district jail, they were released on bail following an Allahabad high court order in 2011.” In the decade since, Pratap and Narendra died while the trial went on, with long intervals between hearings. Sharma said, “Rajendra and Niranjan have been arrested and are now in Agra district jail.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/former-army-man-70-kin-80-get-life-42-yrs-after-murder-of-4/articleshow/81766880.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Nagpur||See where system failed, say women IFS officers calling for empathetic workplace||Nagpur: Perturbed by the harassment late RFO Deepali Chavan allegedly faced at the hands of her senior, the women IFS officers in Maharashtra have called for IFS officials to introspect about what was wrong in the system and how to deal with such issues in a more humane way. In a written communication to PCCF (HoFF) and office-bearers of the IFS Association, Maharashtra, the women IFS officers have said they were in great pain about recent incidents of alarming nature in the forest department, especially faced by women officers. “We strongly condemn the insensitivity faced by RFO Chavan at her workplace and the circumstances leading to her death. We request the PCCF office to kindly intervene in this matter to help resolve this issue to its fruitful conclusion and restore the dignity back to the department and bring in a more gender-friendly face to the department,” the women officers have said. “The suicide note of Harisal RFO mentions clearly about the inhuman treatment she had undergone throughout her last tenure in the department. It is shocking that the officer in distress had not been rendered any support by her seniors,” they said. “We foresters have a tough work schedule, especially in protection activities. Many times, we are faced with one on one encounters with the encroachers, poachers, timber and sand mafia, and wild animals and thereby exposing the staffers to enormous risks of life and limb. Unfortunately for many, this fight is often a lonely battle,” they said. “Most staffers, because of the nature of the job, also happen to live a solitary life in the field postings. Working in the forest department is demanding and requires immense will power in surviving in remote areas deep in the forest without an adequate support system. In such a context, a more empathetic system within the department is very much required to boost the mental and physical well being of the individual and ensure high morale and overall happiness of our fraternity, irrespective of the cadres and the gender,” the memorandum states. In view of the sad incident, the women IFS members have made several suggestions to improve the system for making the forest department a more efficient and gender-equal place. They have said administrative action needed to be taken against the accused in this case and set as a moral example. The Maharashtra forest department should not tolerate any form of atrocities against its staff irrespective of gender and cadres. Officers across the board must be sensitized in this regard. WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE * A pool of officers for mentorship should be created by including both senior and junior officers that acts even in an informal way to reach out to the distressed and address their issues * Create Grievance Redressal Cell exclusively for dealing with physical and mental harassment at workplace * Free counseling and legal guidance, especially in case of false complaints in cases that attract charges under Atrocities Act, may be provided * If the victim and accused work at the same office and the allegations are of serious nature, transfer of any of the parties should be considered on priority * Monthly meeting of internal complaint committees shall be mandatory and its minutes recorded||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/see-where-system-failed-say-women-ifs-officers-calling-for-empathetic-workplace/articleshow/81767942.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Pune||4 arrested on charges of abusing, attacking docs||Pune: The Wanowrie police arrested four men on the charge of abusing and attacking four persons, including three doctors, following a dispute over putting a Covid-19 patient on ventilator support system on March 25 in a private hospital. Orthopaedic surgeon Suhail Khan (37) from NIBM-Undri Road filed an FIR with the Wanowrie police on March 26. “We had initially arrested Asif Shaikh (33) on March 27 because his name was mentioned in the FIR. Shaikh’s questioning led to the arrest of his accomplices — Afan Farash (22), Zaid Ghodke (20) and Ajinkya Bhange (22), all from Kondhwa — on the same day,” senior inspector Deepak Lagad on Tuesday said. The Pune Cantonment court on March 28 sent the four men to magisterial custody remand for 14 days. Khan told TOI, “Around 30 to 35 men, who knew the patient (38), had assembled outside the Covid care centre at a private hospital in Wanowrie on March 25. The four suspects started questioning the doctors about why their friend had been put on a ventilator support system. I told them, in the presence of the patient’s family, that Covid-19 was unpredicatable. But the suspects became aggresive and abused and attacked us for no reason. ” Khan in his FIR stated, “A patient suffering from high fever was brought to my hospital in Kondhwa on March 13 night. He was given medicines and sent home. The next day, the patient was hospitalised after his sugar-level increased. He was advised to get tested for Covid-19, but he refused. We conducted an x-ray and subjected the patient to a blood test. He tested positive and his treatment for Covid-19 was started. Since the patient’s sugar-level was not coming under control, he was referred to a Covid care centre at a private hospital for treatment on March 22. The patient was put on a ventilator on March 25.” The FIR stated that Khan and two doctors took an update of the patient’s health status, on a request made by his family. They briefed the family that the patient was showing signs of improvement. The suspects then picked up a dispute with Khan over the issue of putting their friend on a ventilator. After a heated argument, the suspects abused Khan. When Khan’s colleagues intervened, the suspects attacked the two doctors — Zakir Khan and Faruki Rafe — and his relative Wajid Khan and fled. An FIR related to causing grievous hurt and intentional insult was registered under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and Maharashtra Medicare Service Persons and Medicare Service Institutions (Prevention of Violence and Damage or Loss to Property) Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/4-arrested-on-charges-of-abusing-attacking-docs/articleshow/81766895.cms||Asseem Shaikh

As images of people joining in the revelry were circulated, Mathura MP Hema Malini and the district administration said that it was an age-old tradition and that people can't be told not to attend but it is unfortunate Covid-19 protocols are not being followed. “The estimated turnout was over 25 lakh for the entire celebration, more than last year’s 21-22 lakh … The increase in footfall came possibly because Mini Kumbh coincided with Holi,” local intelligence unit inspector Pradeep Sharma told TOI. Asked why events on this scale are allowed during a pandemic, Malini said, “This has been going on for ages, but caution was required. The administration is trying its best but more stringency is needed, like the way things were when the outbreak began last year." The MP added the onus was on the people: “It is unfortunate that people don’t listen to appeals in such situations. Many seem to think they won’t be infected … People think the government is harassing them and that Covid-19 has gone away. They want to live normal lives, the way they did before the pandemic. But that is no reason to not follow the restrictions imposed by the government.” She further said, “I attend virtual meetings and never meet anyone without wearing a mask. Our safety is in our own hands. No one can do anything until we follow norms.” District magistrate Navneet Singh Chahal told TOI that people did wear masks initially but took them off during the celebrations. “We can’t do much about it,” he said. “We keep on advising them but not everyone listens.” The nine-day Holi celebrations, sponsored by the state for the first time, began with Laddoo Holi on March 22 and concluded with Huranga Holi on Tuesday. Thousands had turned up for the final day of ‘Rangotsav’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/as-covid-surges-25l-turn-up-for-9-day-holi-revelry-in-up-sans-caution/articleshow/81766898.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

---||Delhi||Switch Delhi: Minister urges youth to adopt EVs as their first vehicle||NEW DELHI: Transport minister Kailash Gahlot urged the youth of the city to “drive the change” by adopting electric vehicles (EVs). Gahlot said that the eighth and final week of Switch Delhi EV mass awareness campaign will focus on the most important and dynamic section of the capital – the youth. The campaign aims to sensitise, inform and encourage Delhi’s youth to adopt green vehicles. “The youth of Delhi can play a huge role in making the EV movement in Delhi a mass movement. I appeal to the youth to make their first vehicle purchase an electric one,” Gahlot said. He said youth is the most important section in any country, especially in a young country like India. “They can drive change and be the torchbearers of this movement,” he said, adding that Delhi government will engage with the youth through the campaign to motivate them. He said that a wide range of financial and non-financial incentives are offered under Delhi’s EV policy and the youth can obtain numerous benefits in buying a green vehicle. “By switching to electric two-wheelers. which have very low operating costs, an individual can make an annual saving of approximately Rs 22,000 as compared to using petrol scooter and Rs 20,000 as compared to a petrol bike,” Gahlot said. He said an average electric two-wheeler provides a lifetime savings of 1.98 tonnes of carbon emissions as compared to an average petrol two-wheeler, which is equivalent to planting 11 trees. “I am sure that the youth of Delhi will spread the message to the rest of the country to adopt electric vehicles and pave the way for a sustainable future,” he said. “The youth is an active stakeholder in helping achieve CM Arvind Kejriwal’s vision of making Delhi the EV capital of India,” the minister added. Gahlot said Delhi’s young population can actively show commitment in this direction by taking the Switch Delhi pledge to adopt an electric vehicle at https://ev.delhi.gov.in/Pledge. “Delhi government has been working tirelessly to lay the ground for a successful transition to electric vehicles in the national capital. I urge Delhiites to now switch to electric, make this a mass movement, take responsibility for our environment,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/switch-delhi-minister-urges-youth-to-adopt-evs-as-their-first-vehicle/articleshow/81767893.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Lucknow||UP: Bridge corporation seeks nod to complete Chowk flyover||LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh State Bridge Corporation (UPSBC) has written to National Monument Authority (NMA) to provide necessary clearance for Chowk flyover. According to UPSBC officials, it will take around 45 days to complete the remaining work of the flyover as soon as they receive approval from the central body. The construction work of Chowk flyover has been halted two months ago after Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) lodged a complaint against UPSBC project manager with the Chowk police station for doing construction activity within 200 metres radius of Bada Imambara in violation of Ancient Monument and Archaeological and Remains Act 1958. However, Lucknow MP representative Diwakar Tripathi told TOI, "UPSBC has already repaired the part where objection was raised by the ASI. Thereafter, a request letter has been sent to the National Monument Authority to allow work so that the flyover can be completed. We expect to get approval within a month." In its complaint, ASI had said that despite the ban on construction activities within the 200 metres periphery of the monument, the digging work for the approach road to the flyover was carried out in the area. The ASI had also stated that UPSBC did not apply for a no-objection certificate from the body. Constructed at a cost of Rs 110 crore, once operational the project will greatly benefit more than 50,000 commuters of Rajajipuram, Chowk, Aishbagh and Victoria Street. The flyover will also reduce the travelling time between Victoria Street to KGMU from 25 minutes to just 10 minutes. The project was announced by Lucknow MP Rajnath Singh in 2018. Managing director, UPSBC, Arvind Srivastava said, "As soon as they receive clearance from ASI, the construction work of flyover will be completed within 45 days. About 90% of the work has already been completed."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bridge-corpn-seeks-nod-to-complete-chowk-flyover/articleshow/81769170.cms||Pranchal Srivastava

The minimum temperature was 21.3 degrees Celsius, three degrees above normal. The weatherman has warned that temperature is likely to rise later this week. The heat was unbearable as a dust storm, which lasted for about an hour, swirled through the region. The dust-laden sky turned brownish. With low humidity, temperatures were above normal across UP on Tuesday. The highest temperature was recorded in Varanasi at 41.6 degrees, followed by Agra at 40.6 degrees and Lucknow registered 40.4 degrees Celsius. The temperatures remained a shade lower in west UP with Aligarh at 38.4 degree Celsius, Bareilly at 38.3 degrees and Meerut region recorded 36.4 degrees Celsius. The high temperatures in the Agra region will adversely impact pulses, vegetables, and fruit crops, warned agriculture department officials. “This year, the temperature has been above normal since February 15. The average temperature in the first half of March has been higher in comparison to that in the past five years. The high temperature along with the westerly winds are harmful for pulses. Yields of vegetable and fruit crops are likely to fall. Controlled irrigation is required to protect crops from adverse weather conditions,” said Agra district agriculture officer Rampravesh Verma. Last year on March 15, the maximum temperature in the region was recorded at 32 degrees Celsius while the minimum was 18 degrees, Met office data revealed.The unusual heat has already affected the growth of capsicum, cultivated across 4,200 hectares in neighbouring Firozabad district under Agra division. The yield is likely to drop by over 30%, according to farmers there. Meanwhile, the rising temperatures have pushed up the sale of air conditioners and coolers. Earthen pots are selling like hot cakes. “This year, summers have arrived early. With temperature soaring over 40 degree Celsius, customers for air conditioners and coolers have started coming,” said a Sadar Bazaar-based electronic goods dealer here. Chief medical officer of Agra district Dr RC Pandey has cautioned people from summer-related ailments. He said there is already a surge in number of patients suffering from fever, stomach problems and headache at government hospitals. “Changing weather condition require some basic precautions to stay fit. People must stick to balanced diet. Frequent intake of water will be beneficial. Maintenance of sanitation and hygiene should be a high priority,” he advised.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/agra-reels-under-hottest-day-of-season-at-over-40-degrees-celsius/articleshow/81766906.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Chandigarh||MLA assaulted in Punjab, BJP protests in Haryana||AMBALA/CHANDIGARH/ROHTAK/KARNAL: The Haryana BJP on Tuesday held protests in the state, burning effigies of Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh and demanding his resignation over last week’s attack on party MLA Arun Narang in Muktsar. They demanded the President’s rule in Punjab and dismissal of the Congress government in Punjab over the law and order situation in the state, saying they will not tolerate such behaviour with its leaders. They also accused the Congress of trying to defame farmers by blaming them for an act committed by its (Congress) workers in Punjab. Narang was allegedly thrashed and his clothes ripped off by a group of protesting farmers at Malout on Saturday. The BJP leaders said Narang’s human rights had been violated in Malout and the officials of Punjab government failed to prevent this incident. Protests were held in Panchkula, Ambala, Kurukshetra, Karnal, Rohtak and Yamunanagar among other places. In Ambala, BJP’s district president Rajesh Batoura led the protest outside Barara Municipal Council and burnt the effigies of Capt Amarinder and farm leader Sukhdarshan Singh. “Our party will not tolerate indecent behaviour with our party leaders,” he said. Similar protests were held at many other places in Ambala. Kurukshetra district president Raj Kumar Saini, who led a similar protest in the district, accused the Congress of “gundagardi (hooliganism)” in the name of farmers’ movement. “The agitation is not of farmers but of the Congress party and Leftists. They are trying to create unrest in the society and the incident with a BJP leader in Punjab is evidence of hooliganism in the Congress-ruled state. We demand imposition of the President’s rule in India.” In Yamunanagar, MLA Ghanshyam Das Arora and party’s district president Rajesh Sapra led the protest. There were minor incidents of young farmers confronting BJP activists in Bhiwani district and farmers and activists reaching the BJP headquarters by breaching security arrangements. The protest was staged at Committee Chowk in Karnal and Chhotu Ram Chowk in Rohtak. BJP Karnal district president Yogendra Rana said, “Democracy was murdered in Punjab as an elected representative was thrashed in the presence of police force. The incident has exposed the failure of Amarinder-led Congress government in Punjab. Hence, he should resign from his post over the failure of law and order.” In Rohtak, BJP state spokesperson Shamsher Kharak demanded President’s rule in Punjab. Meanwhile, the BJP has given a call against farmers stir on Wednesday, following INLD leader Abhay Singh Chautala’s appeal to farmers to teach a lesson to BJP and JJP leaders who enter their villages. Stay away from BJP protest: Charuni to farmers The BKU Haryana (Charuni) state president released a video, urging farmers to stay away from the BJP protest. “The BJP leaders have given a call to protest against the incident with their party leader in Punjab. This could be a conspiracy for clash between farmers and BJP workers,” he appealed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mla-assaulted-in-punjab-bjp-protests-in-haryana/articleshow/81767899.cms||---

Over 1,000 police personnel will be recruited at various levels, from police sub-inspectors (PSI) to police constables (PC). At present, the total strength of Goa police is at over 5,000 against the sanctioned strength of over 6,000. Of the 1,097 posts that have been advertised by Goa police, 145 are that of PSI, 857 PCs, one searcher, 6 assistant sub-inspectors, 1 photographer, 2 laboratory technicians, 11 PC (bandsman, male candidates), 1 PC (mast lasker, male candidates), 29 PC (wireless messengers), 10 stenographers and 34 lower division clerk (LDC). A senior police officer said that, in 2018, the state high-level committee had approved 902 posts for Goa police. These were filled through promotions, which is why, this time, Goa police can go in for direct recruitment, the officer said. Goa police had earlier requested the state government for permission to recruit 1,228 personnel to help check the rising influx of tourists, a phenomenon, it had said, made maintenance of law and order challenging. Goa police on Tuesday promoted 29 assistant sub-inspectors (ASI) to the post of PSI, over 30 head constables to the post of ASI and 130 PC to the post of head constable. The state government has changed the rules to allow the Goa Public Service Commission (GPSC) to promote PSI to the post of police inspectors (PI). Earlier, the Police Establishment Board would carry out the promotion for PSIs. Now, GPSC also handles the promotion of PIs and deputy superintendents of police (DySPs). The government has, however, not taken any decision on the proposal by Goa police to amend the existing PSI recruitment rules. The department had sought to promote ASIs with a minimum of two years of regular service to the post of PI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-massive-recruitment-drive-goa-police-to-fill-1k-posts/articleshow/81767945.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Sealed floors up 300% in March; BMC asks hsg societies to self-quarantine too||Mumbai: As Covid-19 cases are rising in the city, so are the number of sealed buildings and floors. Civic data shows there has been a more than 300% rise in the number of sealed floors in the city in a month. While the number of sealed floors as on February 26 stood at 1,849, they now total 7,475. Sealed buildings during the period have increased to 578 from 161. Containment zones in slums and chawls, too, have multiplied to 64 from 12. BMC, though, has said ever since the surge last month, maximum Covid cases are being reported from housing societies. The BMC protocol calls for sealing of an entire building with five or more positive cases and, if fewer, sealing of floors. While many have been complaining that sealing is not being followed and residents of highrises flout quarantine rules, BMC commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal on Tuesday said there is a need for managing committees of housing societies to ensure self-styled sealing. Chahal appealed to managing committees of multi-storeyed buildings to be equally responsible. “Their role is as big as BMC’s in observing certain discipline and ensuring the buildings becomes virus-free by declaring a sort of a self-containment system. Everything cannot be done by policing and this is where I would appeal to every managing committee member of a society to come forward and declare self-styled sealing, so that the virus does not spread. The earlier this is done, the better,” he said. Chahal has also said if citizens do not comply with Covid-19 restrictions, they will be compelled to take tough decisions.Locals have alleged at the ground level, sealing is not being done as it should be and people are seen walking in and out, flouting quarantine norms. In the past, BMC has filed police cases against those violating the norms. This month, BMC filed an FIR against actor Gauhar Khan for flouting the home quarantine norm. On March 9, BMC’s H-West Ward had filed an FIR against a family for allegedly violating the norms and tampering with test reports. Congress corporator Ravi Raja said BMC needs to keep a watch on sealed buildings and floors. “BMC could then request managing committee members to alert them if someone flouts the norms so that action can be taken accordingly. But they cannot put the onus completely on managing committees.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sealed-floors-up-300-in-march-bmc-asks-hsg-societies-to-self-quarantine-too/articleshow/81767976.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Ludhiana||Farm leaders named in FIR, but BJP blames Cong for Malout incident||JALANDHAR: Even as local office-bearers and activists of BKU (Ekta Sidhupur) have been named in the FIR registered after an assault on BJP MLA Arun Narang at Malout, Punjab BJP is insisting that the incumbent Congress “is behind the premeditated attack”. Addressing a press conference here to highlight the “failures of Captain Amarinder Singh-led government in last four years,” BJP’s Madan Mohan Mittal said that these were not farmers but Congress workers who attacked the MLA. When pointed out that the accused had been even named in the FIR and they were from farm groups, he reiterated that the Congress was behind the attack. Mittal was accompanied by another former minister Manoranjan Kalia and former chief parliamentary secretary K D Bhandari and other local BJP functionaries. He said the beating and stripping of the BJP MLA by was an extreme case. However, when asked if the mob violence in Punjab could be compared to mob violence and lynching in other states, he avoided a direct reply. When asked further that BJP remained silent on attack by a mob at farmers’ camp at Singhu border on January 29 in the presence of police, Mittal said he was not aware of the incident and added that “everything is not debatable”. Mittal said, “Narang is not just another MLA, he defeated Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar who could not digest the defeat.” He said Punjab Police were competent but their hands were also tied and they were acting as per government directions and failed to save Narang. Replying to a query he said the Punjab DGP was also responsible for the assault, along with the state government. Unprecedented security and barricading There were unprecedented security and barricading outside the hotel where BJP event was held. The stretch of quite busy road outside the hotel between two crossroads was completely closed and barricaded and people had to take long alternate routes. Identity cards of the journalists were also checked by the police. Even inside the hotel, police personnel were deployed and a deputy commissioner of police remained present at the venue. The barricading was lifted only after BJP functionaries left. Mittal also said in the press conference, on a lighter note, that two policemen remained deployed outside the room of the hotel where he was staying.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/farm-leaders-named-in-fir-but-bjp-blames-cong-for-malout-incident/articleshow/81767921.cms||---

Asserting that such measures have become very vital since the court is moving into unchartered waters, Justice N Anand Venkatesh said, “To be open, I am also trying to break my own preconceived notions about this issue and I am in the process of evolving and sincerely attempting to understand the feelings of the couple and their parents.” The court made the observations on a protection plea moved by a same sex couple facing harassment from their parents and police. The two petitioners, aged 22 years and 20 years, are residents of Madurai who fled to Chennai in the first week of March after their parents opposed their relationship. While they were given a safe shelter by an LGBT activist in the city, the parents lodged a kidnap complaint with the Madurai police. Based on the complaint, police started harassing the activists and the couple prompting them to approach the high court. Admitting the plea, the court decided to conduct an in-camera hearing considering the sensitivity of the issue. When the plea was taken up for hearing on Monday, the court was informed that the petitioners are being supported by International Foundation for Crime Prevention and Victim Care (PCVC), an NGO. After interacting with the petitioners, the judge said, “They have known each other for the last two years and both of them in unison stated that their friendship blossomed into love and they were very clear that both of them will be a partner to each other for life. They did not mince any words and there was so much clarity in what they wanted to convey.” The court individually interacted with the parents of the couple. “They are obviously shocked, and they are not able to immediately accept the relationship between their daughters,” the court added. The court also ordered counselling for the parents of the couple by the same counsellor. The case will be heard next on April 28.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/hc-comes-to-rescue-of-same-sex-couple/articleshow/81766903.cms||---

---||Lucknow||UP’s Purvanchal has a key role to play in Bengal polls||Lucknow: UP's Purvanchal, the cluster of eastern Uttar Pradesh districts, has a key role to play in West Bengal elections happening a thousand kilometres away. As almost every village in the eastern UP has some of its families living in the eastern India state, both BJP and Trinamool Congress have roped in their cadre from Purvanchal to woo the voters. CM Yogi Adityanath, the star campaigner for the BJP, hails from Gorakhpur, the undeclared capital of Purvanchal. Apart from swinging Hindu voters in general in favour of the BJP, the party also bank on him to win over the people from Purvanchal, says a political analyst. The workers in UP unit of TMC, on the other hand, have been asked to search for their relatives, even the remote ones, staying in Bengal, get in touch with them and explain to them the schemes and welfare measures "Didi" has introduced in their favour. Neeraj Rai, UP TMC president, said, “Jab ek rishtedaar doosre rishtedaar ko batayega ki sach kya hai toh baat samajh main aayegi ki BJP kitna jhooth bol rahi hai. Our state committee will reach West Bengal after Holi. Our party’s face is “Didi” but we have to play its eyes, ears and limbs." To reach out to these "Hindi Bhashi" (Hindi speaking) residents of Bengal, TMC is depending on the country's Hindi-belt. As per TMC’s assessment, at least 52 out of 294 assembly seats, from Asansol till Bardhaman and in between, have dominance of people from UP's eastern belt right from Prayagraj to Varanasi, Gorakhpur, Mau, Ghazipur, Chandauli, Kushinagar, Ambedkarnagar, Ballia, Basti till Sonbhadra. West Bengal has been a hub of small-scale industries and that has made people from Purvanchal migrate to that place. “When we make our brothers and sisters from Purvanchal realize this they would understand the difference between Didi and Modi," said Rai who himself is from Sherpur village in Ghazipur. This apart, some of the prominent Bengali faces, who enjoy a mass support, from UP may also have a role to play in Bengal elections. “We cannot reveal their names. But we have about a crore of Bengals in UP. Varanasi has a huge population. They have their roots in Bengal and when these people will reach out to their relatives back home and tell them how BJP government in UP has not done anything for them it will snowball into a different issue," said Rai. UP apart, Punjab has lot of its people living in Bengal. Punjab state committee will search for their people in Bengal like UP people will do for `purabiyas'. Bihar, Jharkhand and Harayan are the other states who will have their office-bearers as foot soldiers of TMC in Bengal. The UP state unit of TMC has organization set-up ready in at least 55 districts of UP. It's because of the assembly elections in Bengal and party's decision to use the UP workforce for campaigning in the sate, TMC's plan to contest UP panchayat elections may be hit. "We might support candidates if any of our party workers wish to contest. As of now, our focus is on bengal elections," said Rai. The UP unit of BJP also has its senior leaders and organizational experts camping in Bengal since the start of March. This is in addition to the rallies held by the UP CM Yogi Adityanath. Yogi besides being a Hindutva icon is also the Mahant of the Gorakhnath temple and that makes him a popular figure in Purvanchal. Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya, union minister Sanjiv Baliyan, state BJP general secretary (Organization) Sunil Bansal along with senior office-bearers in the organization from Gorakhpur and other east UP districts are present in Bengal. "We have been holding rallies to reach out to voters. At the same time, our focus is on election management which, simply, means from drawing crowd in rallies to ensuring a fair voting," said UP BJP vice-president, JPS Rathore, who is camping in Bengal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ups-purvanchal-has-a-key-role-to-play-in-bengal-polls/articleshow/81769237.cms||Neha Shukla
---||Amritsar||No further arrests, MLA says police under pressure||BATHINDA: Muktsar police are learnt to be heading cautiously to make further arrests in the case of Abohar BJP MLA Arun Narang being thrashed and stripped in Malout on Saturday. Four persons were arrested and 23 were identified in the MLA assault case on Sunday, but no more arrests have been made in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, a daylong protest was staged by farmers on the Malout-Bathinda road on Monday, against the registration of a case under various charges, including attempt to murder, in connection with the incident and against police raids conducted to nab the accused. BJP activists, meanwhile, observed a bandh in Abohar town on Tuesday wherein Narang alleged that police were being pressured by the state government and farm organisations to not make any more arrests. Narang was thrashed and stripped at the BJP office in Malout on Saturday evening, when he had gone there to address a press conference. Muktsar police SP Gurmel Singh too had sustained injuries in the melee. Punjab CM Capt Amarinder Singh had directed DGP Dinkar Gupta to take strict action, under the law, against the perpetrators, who also clashed with police personnel who tried to rescue the MLA. The additional chief secretary (home) had shot off letters to DCs, commissioners and SSPs to ensure security of BJP leaders. While BJP observed a half-day bandh in Malout on Monday, activists of farm organisations disrupted traffic and raised slogans against police. They lifted the protest in the evening, on assurances by an SP-rank officer that no innocent or anyone would be arrested on hearsay. Earlier, the residents of Fakkarsar village asked police not to arrest two persons named in the case or police would have to face the anger of villagers. Farm organisation BKU (Ekta Sidhupur) activists Sukhmandar Singh and Kuldeep Singh said, “BJP is unhappy over what happened with its MLA, but is unmoved while over 300 farmers have died during the protest. The party did not even shed tears for those who died.” They said farm activists Nanak and Avtar Singh from Fakkarsar had been named in the case. Muktsar superintendent of police (investigation) Rajpal Singh said, “No arrests were made after four persons were arrested on Sunday. Police do not want to arrest any innocents, but we will nab anyone who is responsible for the act.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/no-further-arrests-mla-says-police-under-pressure/articleshow/81767944.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Chennai||In golden jubilee year, MIDS looks to venture into teaching||CHENNAI: Following 50 years of research on socio-economic and political changes in Tamil Nadu, Madras Institute of Development Studies (MIDS), a pioneering research institute, is now planning to expand its footprint into teaching as part of its golden jubilee year celebrations. The institute, which admitted only PhD students till now, is planning to offer diploma and postgraduate courses in interdisciplinary areas focussed on development practices for professionals and students. With very few options for students from the state wishing to join social sciences, the institute aims to become a pioneer centre for excellence in social sciences in the next few years. The new initiative would be a big leap for the institute, which currently functions out of a single building in Adyar. P G Babu, director of MIDS, said the present campus won't be sufficient for classrooms, students, canteen and hostels. “We need to expand and move to a new campus to turn the research institute into a teaching and research hub.” “Students don't understand the importance of economics and development studies. After a masters, students from Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research (IGIDR) or Delhi School of Economics are getting Rs 15 lakh to Rs 18 lakh per annum as starting salary,” he said. Established in 1971 by eminent economist Malcolm Adiseshiah and his wife Elizabeth, MIDS was originally founded as a research institution to develop knowledge about the state’s economy and society.  The institute is jointly funded by Indian Council for Social Science Research (ICSSR) and Tamil Nadu government To set up a new campus, MIDS may need additional funding from the state government. “We do not receive the same financial support as some of our peers like the Centre for Development Studies in Kerala, Institute for Social and Economic Change in Karnataka, Centre for Economic and Social Studies in Hyderabad. Their state governments go out of their way to fund them,” he further said. As part of golden jubilee celebrations, the institute is planning to bring out a series of books, translated from English to Tamil, including the famous “History of Economic Thought” by Neelakandan and “Economic Policies in Covid-19 Times”, a collection of research papers by faculty members, apart from Malcolm Adiseshiah's rare essays in Tamil. On its journey in the past 50 years, A R Venkatachalapathy, historian and professor at MIDS said, “Both in terms of quantity and quality, the institute has outclassed other universities and research institutions in Tamil Nadu despite receiving a fraction of funding what other institutions have been receiving.” The library at the institute is one of the best in its class, with a collection of more than 60,000 books, journals and articles. It is open to researchers, students and the general public. “There is no major scholar who comes to Tamil Nadu but does not speak at our institute,” Venkatachalapathy said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/in-golden-jubilee-year-mids-looks-to-venture-into-teaching/articleshow/81766909.cms||A Ragu Raman

At 32, he is the city’s youngest mayor, a first-time corporator with no administrative experience, but is the son of Panaji MLA Atanasio Monserrate and revenue minister Jennifer Monserrate. Rohit was part of the panel supported by his father that won 25 out of 30 seats in the corporation. “I have my mother and father as minister and MLA respectively, so I plan on using their experience,” Rohit said after taking oath. Asked for his priorities for the city, he said, “fulfilling my dad’s manifesto”. Jennifer congratulated her son and said he has an excellent deputy mayor in Vasant Agshikar, who will serve his second term in the role. “They, with the help of the panel and ex-mayors Uday Madkaikar and Surendra Furtado, should do really well,” she said. “I think they will have to work together if they want anything to be done.” However, Rohit didn’t have any plan or strategy ready. “Give me some time and I’ll give you a concrete plan on what we want to achieve,” he said. Jennifer said she and Babush would guide their son. Asked about her entire family being in politics, she said she is “happy for Rohit” and “hopes he does well”. While the debutant mayor didn’t prepare a formal speech, he thanked CM Pramod Sawant, and the BJP state president and general secretary. ““I wouldn’t be able to achieve it without their support,” he said. “I want to thank them for putting their faith in both of us and hope to achieve whatever they want to achieve and their agenda.” He also said the panel has both youth and experience. “We have a solid team and we will take the rest of the panel into confidence before we take decisions,” he said. “We have to capitalise on the experience we have on our side. As of now, we will have to sit with the entire panel and chalk out three to four priorities this year.” All 30 corporators were administered the oath of office on Tuesday. Rohit, along with former mayors Shubham Chodankar, Vithal Chopdekar, Carolina Po and former deputy mayor Asmita Kerkar, and corporator Prasad Amonkar were elected members of the standing committee.

---||Mumbai||Supply of Covid beds in Mumbai far more than demand: BMC chief||Mumbai: BMC commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal on Tuesday claimed the number of Covid-19 beds available in Mumbai are “far ahead of the demand” at the moment.Reeling of statistics to allay fears engendered by the highly infectious second wave of the pandemic, Chahal said 9,900 beds were utilized for Covid-19 patients over the last 58 days. At present, the BMC has over 13,000 beds in both the private and public sectors. “We still have 650 ICU beds available and 250 ventilators that are idle,” he said.By this weekend, bed capacity in the city will increase to 17,000. Private hospitals will add 2,269 (including 360 ICU beds) and BMC will add 1,500 to jumbo field hospitals. There will be approximately 7,000 vacant beds by the weekend. Availability is far in “excess” of demand, he said.Chahal had issued an order on Monday directing ward officers to monitor and take control of hospital beds in private facilities within their jurisdiction in order to centralise allocation to patients.Mumbai’s ‘comfortable’ situation, he said, could be attributed to two factors – firstly, almost 85% of diagnosed patients are asymptomatic and not in need of hospitalization; secondly, BMC has centralized distribution of Covid-19 beds.Of the 85,000 cases in Mumbai between February 10 and March 29, over 69,500 were asymptomatic while 8,000-odd needed beds. “The ratio of asymptomatic patients has been stable for the last 48 days and is unlikely to take a U-turn,” he added.Moreover, 269 deaths have occurred in the same period, translating into a case fatality rate of 0.2%--far lower than the World Health Organisation’s safe ratio of less than 1. To avoid chaos, no beds are directly given to patients. Laboratories share reports with BMC. “Even if 8,000 positive cases come in, the list is split into 24 wards. Every ward has a team of doctors and teachers who, round the clock, work on bed allotment,” he said.He urged patients to let the positive detections first come to the BMC. “We will go to their homes with bed allocation early next morning,” said Chahal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/supply-of-covid-beds-in-mumbai-far-more-than-demand-bmc-chief/articleshow/81768080.cms||Richa Pinto

The AAP leader’s entry in Haryana comes at a time when resentment among farmers has been growing towards the BJP-JJP government in the state on the three farm laws. Earlier, BKU spokesperson Rakesh Tikait also addressed a kisan mahapanchayat at Kandela village in Jind on February 3. AAP Rajya Sabha member Sushil Gupta said in a press conference here that Punjab MP Bhagwant Mann and Haryana affairs incharge Gopal Rai will also address the gathering. tnnHe said AAP will not use its flags and party symbol in the meeting. Gupta, who hails from Jind district, said the party was expecting nearly 50,000 people to attend the event. Gupta said the farmers had been protesting for nearly four months on the borders of Delhi, but the Centre and state government had shown disregard towards these farmers. “The AAP wants an amicable solution and the party has been supporting farmers at dharna sites. It’s a shame that though nearly 400 farmers have died during the ongoing agitation, the government is showing no signs of relenting,” he said. The activists of Chhotu Ram Vichar Manch, a farmers organisation, also promised to support the mahapanchayat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/aap-plans-jind-rally-on-april-4/articleshow/81768025.cms||---

The morbidity and mortality due to infection, however, continue to be higher among the elderly and those with pre-existing comorbidities. “Younger people are going out a lot. They feel even if they are infected, it will only cause mild symptoms,” said Dr Randeep Guleria, director, AIIMS. He added that it was important to realise that the youngsters could become super-spreaders if they do not follow Covid-appropriate behaviour while going out, and eventually lead to more cases among the high-risk groups. In the past few weeks, deaths due to Covid-19 have also increased. On Wednesday, the capital recorded 11 deaths due to infection in the past 24 hours. Also, 1,819 new cases were reported with a positivity rate of 2.71%. The city recorded 992 cases on Tuesday, 1,904 cases on Monday and 1,881 cases on Sunday. It saw 1,558 cases on Saturday, 1,534 cases on Friday, 1,515 cases on Thursday, 1,254 cases on Wednesday and 1,101 cases last Tuesday, when it crossed the 1,000-mark for the first time since December 24. The positivity rate was 2.7% on Tuesday, 2.77% on Monday, 2.35% on Sunday, 1.7% on Saturday, 1.8% on Friday, and 1.69% on Thursday. The number of active cases rose to 8,838 from 7,429 on Tuesday. A total of 67,070 tests, including 36,808 RT-PCR tests, were conducted in the past 24 hours, the health bulletin said. The number of people under home isolation rose to 5,196 from 4,832 on Tuesday. The containment zones rose to 2,009 from 1,903 on Tuesday, it added. The caseload in Delhi on January 1 stood at over 6.25 lakh, while the total fatalities were 10,557. The number of daily cases started to come down in February. On February 26, the month’s highest daily count of 256 cases was recorded. However, the daily cases began to rise again in March and have been steadily increasing since. “There is a surge in admissions due to Covid-19 over the past week. It involves all age groups, but complications are seen more in the elderly,” said Dr Rommel Tickoo, associate director, internal medicine, Max Saket. Health Minister Satyendar Jain had last week dismissed any possibility of imposing another lockdown in Delhi, saying it was not a solution to check the spread of the coronavirus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/more-covid-cases-among-youth-kids/articleshow/81791859.cms||---
---||Pune||Vandals, thieves reducing DSK Dream City to rubble||Pune: Thieves have been steadily targeting the buildings and furniture inside DSK Dream City, especially the DSK International Campus, in Phursungi near Hadapsar. Before 2017, the shiny glass buildings along the Pune-Solapur highway housed colleges, hostels and other commercial areas with well-kept gardens. The premises, which include about 1,000 rooms in three buildings of the global education setup and Waterfall Residency, were sealed by the economic offences wing on October 28, 2017 after a cheating case of over Rs 2,000 crore was registered against D S Kulkarni and his family in February 2017. Kulkarni, his wife and others are in prison. The front gates and all the rooms were locked by the police in 2017 and no one was allowed to venture inside the area. But, the deserted premises have become a haven for thieves and miscreants. Doors, cupboards, chairs, vehicles, air-conditioners, water purifiers, electrical units, CCTVs, television sets, computers, vehicles, aluminium plates and other furniture have been stolen from the buildings in the last two years. TOI on Sunday afternoon visited the project and found that the police have dug up a trench on the road connecting DSK Dream City and Pune–Solapur highway to stall intrusions. However, thieves have filled up the trench with gravel and drive up to the site in pick-up trucks to steal what they want from the buildings. The concrete road is in a bad shape with overgrown grass and trees and the entrance gates and the cabins are damaged. Thieves have taken away entire windows and left aluminium strips hanging dangerously. On Sunday, beat marshals from Hadapsar police station caught two persons while stealing aluminium plates from a building. Local farmers told TOI that they do not visit the area as it has become a den for the drunks even in the day time. “There could be many criminals hiding in these buildings and they could harm us,” they said. Senior police inspector Balkrishna Kadam of Hadapsar police station said, “So far, we have registered three cases of thefts from the DSK Dream City. It is a huge area and cannot be manned 24 by 7 by policemen. Beat marshals regularly visit the area to keep an eye on miscreants.” Deputy commissioner of police (EOW) Bhagyashri Navatake said, “We will review the security of the premises along with the local police. It can be protected with proper vigil.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/vandals-thieves-reducing-dsk-dream-city-to-rubble/articleshow/81766934.cms||---

Allegations of a second successive custodial death has put the district police under scanner. Chandan, 45, who was accused of bike theft died on Sunday, 48 hours after he was detained by Tanda cops and his family claimed he succumbed to injuries suffered during torture at the police station. Chandan was detained on suspicion of vehicle theft on March 26 and was let off the same day. He attended a village function on March 27 and died the next day. Police said, the autopsy report did not point to injuries on his body and his viscera was sent for examination to establish cause of death. Allegations of a second successive custodial death has put the district police under scanner. Talking to TOI, SP, Ambedkarnagar, Alok Priyadarshi, said, “While eight cops were suspended after the lock-up death in Akbarpur, we haven’t found any evidence so far to indict the Tanda police.” SHO, Tanda, Sanjay Pandey, said, Chandan and few others were being probed for culpable homicide, trespass and bicycle theft. “We picked up Chandan for questioning on March 26 after a bicycle of a murdered villager, Qadir, was found to in his possession. However, Chandan refused to co-operate with police and said he would release the bike only after the panchayat intervenes. We freed him from detention in less than 24 hours and sent him for a medical examination at a government hospital. Thereafter, he went to attend a ‘terahvi’ ceremony and fell ill. On March 28, he died and his kin claimed he was tortured by police,” said Pandey.

---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu elections 2021: PM Modi takes a dig at TMC & DMK, slams opposition for insulting women||DHARAPURAM/ PUDUCHERRY: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday launched a broadside against the opposition including the DMK and the Congress in Tamil Nadu and Bengal foes Trinamool Congress and the Left for their “anti-women” mindset.  The PM, who commenced his speech with ‘Veera Vel, Vetri Vel’ chant at a public meeting of the NDA at Dharapuram in Tirupur district on Tuesday, recalled the death of Shova Majumdar, mother of a BJP worker in Bengal, and said the culture of the opposition is to insult women. Without naming A Raja, Modi said the Congress and the DMK have launched their ‘outdated 2G missile’ and this missile has one clear target, the women of Tamil Nadu. “Congress and DMK have insulted the respected mother of chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami. God forbid, if they come to power, they will insult many other women of Tamil Nadu,” the PM said. He also recalled the alleged attack on late chief minister J Jayalalithaa in the state assembly in 1989, DMK orator Dindigul Leoni’s alleged sexist speech about obese women and Udhayanidhi Stalin’s controversial statements. Taking a dig at Udhayanidhi for allegedly sidelining senior leaders, Modi said “DMK’s crown prince” has also said ‘horrible things’ about women. He said while the NDA’s agenda is development, the Congress and the DMK have their own ‘dynasty agenda,’ had nothing positive to offer and all they did was to ‘demean’ others and spread ‘lies’. Modi said India took great pride in the culture of Tamil Nadu. “One of the happiest moments of my life was when I got a chance to speak a few words in the oldest language in the world, Tamil at the United Nations.” He had quoted Tamil poet Kaniyan Poongundranar’s ‘Yaadum Oorey’ verse in the UN in 2019 which denoted unity. The PM said that to underscore the importance of farming and farmers he had cited Tamil classic ‘Thirukkural’ on several occasions. Asserting that the NDA is for promotion of Tamil culture and language, he said they were looking into ensuring technical and medical education in Tamil, if possible. Later, addressing a public meeting in Puducherry, Modi said he was witnessing a huge wave in favour of NDA in the Union territory as well as in four poll-bound states. “I went to Assam and West Bengal quite a few times. Today I was in Kerala in the morning and Tamil Nadu in the afternoon. Now I am among you in Puducherry. In all the four states and Union territory I am seeing a huge wave in favour of the NDA,” Modi said. Modi took a dig at former CM Narayanaswamy remarking the assembly election in Puducherry was unique. “Because the sitting chief minister was not given a ticket. So many years of loyalty - lifting the slippers of his leader and doing the wrong translation to impress his leader. Still no ticket. This clearly shows how much of a disaster the government turned out to be,” he said. Terming the previous Congress government in Puducherry as ‘Delhi high command government’, he said the government has failed on all fronts. “Be it any sector, there was loot and only loot. MLAs of Congress party are openly talking about corruption directly linking to the family members of the former chief minister,” he said. He promised that the future NDA government in Puducherry will focus on bringing economic growth. “We will not trouble the local industries. New jobs will be created for the youth. We are working to strengthen the blue economy so that the fisheries sector grows,” he said. EPS, OPS heap praise on ModiEven as BJP candidates are facing flak for avoiding Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s images in their campaign material fearing a purported negative impact, chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami and his deputy O Panneerselvam showered encomiums on the PM at NDA’s public meeting in Dharapuram on Tuesday. “The PM works for the development of India without wasting even a minute. He has made the dream of Indians to lift India as superpower come true,’’ EPS said. “As far as TN is concerned, he is a PM who grants all the schemes we want. He has made TN as the state with the best road infrastructure by granting ₹1.5 lakh crore for widening and development of 5,600km of road,’’ he continued. EPS then sought the support of Modi to complete Godavari–Cauvery river linking project. “When the scheme materializes, TN people will rejoice. Water shortage would become a thing of the past,’’ he said. Deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam called Modi the ‘real jallikattu hero’. “Many call me the Jallikattu Nayagan. But the real hero is Modi. Because it was he who got four government departments to pass orders within 24 hours facilitating the removal of the ban on jallikattu,’’ he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/pm-takes-a-dig-at-tmc-dmk-slams-oppn-for-insulting-women/articleshow/81768069.cms||V Mayilvaganan

---||Mumbai||Double-decker fleet to drop to 20%, only 41 buses to ply in city next mth-Mumbai||MUMBAI: The fleet of double-decker buses had recently been reduced by 60%, and will now further shrink by 20% and just 41 of them will ply on city roads next month. As there is no sign of the BEST administration procuring new buses soon, senior BEST committee member Sunil Ganacharya plans to take up the issue on priority at Wednesday’s meeting. In February-March, the 120-strong fleet was reduced to 51, and the number will further drop to 41 as 10 double-deckers will be phased out soon, a BEST official told TOI. A BEST official, however, said that it was ‘normal’ for the double-decker fleet size to shrink as the majority of the buses have attained their life span. “Some of the 10 buses will be sent for scrap, while others may be given away for tourism purposes,” said the official, adding that tenders had been floated in November 2020 to procure 100 new buses. Officials said they plan to get 100 new double-deckers with the latest BS-6 diesel engines and automatic transmission for ease of driving and will restore the fleet size to 120. “The new buses will have two doors and two staircases for safety of passengers alighting and boarding buses,” an official said. Ganacharya, however, pointed out that the BEST administration has been giving the assurance that new buses will “arrive soon”, but it has not been happening for the past few months. Shiv Sena panel member Anil Kokil agreed that it was ‘painful’ to see very few twin-decker buses on the road. “They have good carrying capacity and are a favourite with several Mumbaikars. Shiv Sena will push for the early procurement of new buses as they also cater to many busy routes,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/double-decker-fleet-to-drop-to-20-only-41-buses-to-ply-in-city-next-mth-mumbai/articleshow/81769321.cms||Somit Sen

Hathi Singh of Karan Chhapra village in Bairiya area of Ballia district had contested last elections also and was the runner up. His dream was shattered, but his conviction made him give up his 25-year-old ‘Bhishma Pratigya’ (vow for celibacy) and he got married in time to field his wife in the election. “My supporters were upset after the Karan Chhapra gram pradhan seat was reserved for women. Then they convinced me to marry and field my wife in the election. They even searched a bride for me in a day,” said Singh. “Since serving the people is my only ambition, I decided to give up my pledge of not marrying. The marriage was solemnized at Dharmnathji temple in my village on March 26,” said Hathi Singh told TOI on Tuesday. “Even though it was not auspicious time for weddings as per Hindu traditions, the supporters resolved that I tie the knot before April 13, the last date for nomination filing,” he added. Born and raised in Karan Chhapra village, Hathi Singh went to the Gulf for a few years to earn. “I went to the Gulf after completing my graduation but my dream was different so I decided to return. I contested the last gram pradhan election and came second. I had worked hard in the last five years to win the election this time,” he said. Since my mother is 80 years old, I could not field her and couldn’t rely on any other woman member of my family, he added. His supporters then convinced Hathi Singh to give up his celibacy vow and found a girl, who is pursuing her graduation. “I have full faith in my supporters. They found a girl for me and I accepted their decision and choice. I reached the temple as per their wish and the marriage was solemnized,” said a beaming Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/man-gives-up-celibacy-vow-marries-to-field-wife-in-election/articleshow/81768048.cms||Rajeev Dikshit
---||Nagpur||Neeri’s env status report for Nagpur spells bad news||NAGPUR: The average temperature and instances of heatwaves in Nagpur have been on a constant rise since last two decades. This and many other worrying facts have come to the fore in the latest environmental status report for the city, which for the first time scientifically establishes that the city is severely getting impacted from climate change. Prepared by the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri) for Nagpur Municipal Corporation, the climate change section of the report is based on an in-depth analysis of Regional Meteorological Centre’s data. To establish the effect of climate change, scientists studied weather patterns of around 49 years. “The bigger the data, the better is the analysis. So we found the mean temperature of the time period 1970-2019 and compared average temperature of every year to this mean,” said Suvha Lama, scientist at the climate and strategic urban management division at Neeri. According to the report, the average annual temperature for the last two decades is higher than the 50-year mean with an increasing trend. “80% of the years in 2000-2019 decades have their annual average temperature higher than the baseline value,” the study stated. Considering the same baseline mercury level, scientists quantified the instances of severe heatwaves in the city. While the number of instances of extreme heatwaves between 1980 to 2000 was 2, it went up drastically to 19 between 2000 to 2019. “The overall number of heat days and nights for 2010-2019 decade saw an increase of 9.3 % in comparison to the 1970- 1979 decade,” the study stated. As per scientists, increasing concretisation and reducing green cover are the main causes behind extreme events. The report further highlighted how rainfall pattern has been impacted. Interestingly, while the yearly average of rainfall has not much changed much between 1970-2019, the number of rainy days has significantly reduced. “The total number of rain days has reduced by 16% for the 2010-19 decade in comparison to the baseline data,” the report stated. This, according to scientists, is bad news. “It shows that we are getting intense rains — same amount of rainfall in less number of days. This can give rise to problems like flooding, water-borne diseases like cholera, typhoid, vector-borne diseases like malaria, dengue and infrastructural damages,” said Lama. The report further established that climate change has had an overall impact on agricultural production too. Stating that the city has a reason to worry, Neeri director Rakesh Kumar said, “The city has high population density and the impact of any kind will be felt by larger population. The other positive side however can be that Nagpur can use its resource to bring resilience to itself for combating climate impacts. Specific areas could be to create specific health modules for climate change-related diseases, just the way we did for Covid-19.” Kumar added that to curb extreme events of flood, new norms of storm water drainage design should be adopted. Stressing that the time has come to make a roadmap for mitigation, Atya Kapley, senior principal scientist and head of director’s research cell said, “We need to be ready for climate adaptability. Policy-makers need to make climate resilient urban plans by taking experts’ opinion into consideration.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/neeris-env-status-report-for-city-spells-bad-news/articleshow/81768162.cms||Manka Behl

Dr E Sivanagireddy, an archaeologist who visited the temple which is in shambles on Tuesday, said the temple consists of ‘garbhagriha’, ‘arthamandapa’, ‘mahamandapa’ and a ‘rangamandapa’ supported by 48 pillars. It has a pillared cloister (pradakshinapatha), depitcing the Kakatiya and post Kakatiya temple architecture. “Superstructure on the sanctum sanctorum is missing. The entablature (eve slabs) all around, a span of the pillared mandap on the north-west corner and the wall on the rear side have collapsed due to lack of maintenance. Even the inside and surroundings of the heritage structure is littered with debris and spoiling its aesthetics,” he added. He appealed to the department of heritage and the district administration to look into the matter, restore the past glory of the monument and preserve it for posterity. The temple could be made presentable to tourists by clearing away debris and restore the dilapidated portion under the guidance of heritage conservation experts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kakatiya-era-temple-in-suryapet-lies-in-neglect/articleshow/81766984.cms||---

Mohammed Naseem, 29 — fleeing since the death of his only child — was found lying in a drain in an inebriated condition by neighbours in Baradari locality on Sunday night. He was shifted to a hospital, where he died during the treatment, said police.Police said the autopsy confirmed renal failure as the cause of his death and they had preserved the viscera.Naseem’s kin, meanwhile, alleged that he was poisoned to death by his wife Reena Khan — based on whose complaint he was booked for the culpable homicide of his son Hussain — at the behest of a ‘tantrik’, a regular visitor to their house. However, none of the family members lodged a complaint in this connection, said police. During a heated argument with his brother over a property dispute on Thursday, the boy inadvertently asked Naseem to play with him, but the furious father in a fit of rage grabbed the child and smashed his head on the floor. The child suffered severe head injuries from internal bleeding. The boy was admitted to a private hospital, where he slipped into a coma. On Sunday morning, he succumbed to a brain haemorrhage.Baradari SHO Sheetanshu Singh told TOI, “It seems an overwhelming feeling of guilt to having killed his son overtaken Naseem and he consumed an excess of alcohol despite chronic renal disease he had been suffering from. Meanwhile, Naseem’s family members, including his wife, refused to visit him at the hospital. Even after his death, his family refused to perform the last rites. Neighbours with the support of police buried Naseem. We have investigated the poisoning and tantarik charges, but they turned out to be false,” added the SHO.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/man-accused-of-killing-5-year-old-son-dies-under-mysterious-circumstances/articleshow/81765838.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Delhi||Binge on bhawan fare, sitting at home||NEW DELHI: A feast at any state bhawan canteen or a restaurant on its premises was an eagerly anticipated group activity before the Covid-19 pandemic, the opportunity to partake of a distinct cuisine in specific environs. The coronavirus not only took such joys out of people’s lives, but also hit the earnings at these eateries, including of their staff. Of necessity, many of the bhawan canteens have now started home delivery. And while the eyes and ears may miss the culturally different ambience at the bhawans, the tongue can still rejoice. For those who miss Goa Bhawan’s fish curry, prawn balchao and vindaloo or the scrumptious thalis of Andhra Bhawan and Gujarat Bhawan, the good news is that these are available for online delivery or takeaway. While some state bhawans canteens and restaurants have gone on food delivery apps, others have started their own delivery and takeaway services in the past few months. Patrick Barretto, chef and contractor at Viva O Viva at Goa Niwas in Chanakyapuri, who has been running the operations there for the last decade with his three daughters, revealed that Goan catholic dishes and Saraswat cuisine were very popular with people across the National Capital Region. After the lockdown, many of his patrons placed orders and picked up their dishes from the Niwas’ entrance. Seeing takeaway sales get traction, Barretto started delivering home a couple of months ago. People message him and he sends out his special pomfret, crab, prawns and kingfish preparations. A representative at Andhra Bhawan said the management used to think of the eating spaces there only as dine-in facilities. But after tying up with delivery service justmyroots.com, orders have regularly come in, peaking over the weekends. A Maharashtra Sadan canteen executive similarly said that takeaway orders have seen a surge with many food enthusiasts calling to place their orders for Malwani and Kolhapuri dishes and picking it up themselves or having them conveyed through delivery services Pidge or Wefast. Shreyesh Panchal of Gujarat Bhawan restaurant also began sending food to homes last month and is happy at getting around 20 orders each for thalis for lunch and dinner every day now. And as the word spreads, more patrons are getting on the thali bandwagon. Likewise, Satyeswar Middya, senior manager at Bijoli Grill at Banga Bhawan, the rush is now shifting from dine-in to delivery even though his establishment has mostly been known for its sit-in fare. With Poila Boishakh falling mid-April, the festival’s 24-dish takeaway is getting many advance orders, said Middya. Many independent restaurants at state bhawans, such as Potbelly at Bihar Niwas, are also seeing brisk delivery business. Puja Sahu claimed the outlet, which serves popular Bihari dishes in an open setting, had always been a popular regional cuisine dining venue, but ever since online deliveries began last month, many people are taking the option of having Potbelly’s dishes in the comfort of home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/binge-on-bhawan-fare-sitting-at-home/articleshow/81792039.cms||Amin Ali

The CM also laid the foundation of the expansion of the Gorakhpur Airport terminal building. Now, Gorakhpur has direct flights to Lucknow, New Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Prayagraj. Another flight from Gorakhpur to Ahmedabad is all set to be launched on April 12. Union civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri said Uttar Pradesh is the first state which has drafted a civil aviation policy and said the Jewar international airport in Noida would be completed on time. Speaking on the occasion, CM Yogi said, “The air connectivity in the state was not good earlier. Just four years ago, except Lucknow and Varanasi, not many cities had air service, but with the inspiration of PM Narendra Modi, UP is going to become the first state to provide international flights from five airports.” “PM Modi had said that a person wearing ‘hawai chappal’ should also be able to travel by air, and his dream is coming true. Now, there are flights from Gorakhpur to all major cities like New Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Prayagraj. Today daily flight between Gorakhpur and Lucknow has also started,” he added. The flight is part of the Centre's regional connectivity scheme UDAN that aims to make air travel affordable and available to all regions and states. The expansion of the terminal building would make it possible to handle 200 passengers during peak hours, said Yogi. “A huge airport would come up in Ayodhya and Asia’s largest international airport is under construction in Jewar. Besides, air service would start from Kushinagar International airport soon. Airports are being constructed in Jhansi, Aligarh, Azamgarh, Meerut, Sonbhadra, Lalitpur,” the CM said. State civil aviation minister Nand Gopal Gupta ‘Nandi’ said, “UP is making big strides in development under the leadership of CM Yogi. Jewar airport would create numerous employment opportunities in west UP.” “Four years ago, only 28 cities in Uttar Pradesh air service, but now 88 cities have air connectivity and all the credit for this goes to CM Yogi,” Gupta added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/up-first-state-with-intl-flights-from-5-airports/articleshow/81768146.cms||Arjumand Bano

---||Lucknow||Use of technology seen in 2015 panchayat polls missing in 2021||Lucknow: As the process for UP’s three-tier panchayat polls generates heat in rural areas, the state election commission (SEC) is yet to assume its proactive role for the mobilisation of voters, candidates and above all the administrative authorities. Also, the wide use of technology that was seen in the 2015 elections is missing this time. To introduce transparency in the election process, the then state election commissioner SK Agarwal had connected the NIC with the counting system. As soon as the result was declared candidates automatically got the news with SMSes flashing on their mobile phones. “This was done to foil any bid to manipulate results,” recalled a senior IAS officer who was involved in the election process in 2015 as an observer. But, this time, no such service is being offered by the commission. In the previous elections, candidates were also informed about the scrutiny of nomination papers on their mobile phones. This facility is also missing now. Not only candidates but voters too were provided information about voting dates and location of booths by the SEC. But they are not getting any such facility this time. The SEC aggressively campaigned for poll awareness by giving regular advertisements in newspapers and regional channels. Such campaigns too are missing now. When TOI tried to contact state election commissioner Manoj Kumar to seek his views on the issue his office staff directed it to speak to additional commissioner Ved Prakash Verma. As advised, TOI contacted Verma and asked him when the commission would assume a proactive role vis a vis panchayat polls, he remarked, “I would not comment on it.” Panchayat polls are considered to be the world’s largest election in terms of number of seats – nearly seven lakhs. The polling for the four-phase panchayat polls is set to take place on April 15, 19, 26 and 29 and results will be announced on May 2 along with the five other poll-bound states West Bengal, Assam, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry. Over 12.03 crore voters are expected to cast their votes for which 52.05 crore ballot papers have already been procured for the election to 6,89,658 constitutional posts by the SEC. Since this is the most closely contested elections, particularly of village pradhans, the voting percentage zooms to nearly 80% unlike the urban local bodies elections where average percentage hovers around 40%. In this fiercely fought elections stakes are high following decentralisation of funds directly to panchayats from the state and the Central level and implementation of various welfare schemes by village heads. This is also the reason why bloody clashes are reported in panchayat polls. In order to control violence and check the entry of criminals in the poll arena, in the last panchayat polls in 2015 the SEC had held a series of meetings with police and district authorities and organised video conferences with senior state authorities. But barring a few video-conferences hardly any field meeting with police officers has been coordinated by the SEC, says a political observer. This is causing restlessness among district authorities who fear that in the absence of strict monitoring by the SEC, local politicians would try to influence the process. “Last time, the then SEC SK Agarwal used to protect us against wayward politicians,” says a district magistrate. Agarwal, who also had been principal secretary, home, used to give a list of wanted criminals to district police officers and sought time-bound action against them for holding peaceful elections. “I feel the SEC is merely working as a government department and not more than that,” Congress spokesperson Surendra Rajput told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/use-of-technology-seen-in-2015-panchayat-polls-missing-in-2021/articleshow/81769325.cms||Subhash Mishra

The nursing staff has also been enrolled locally to take care of patients. Officials in Vadodara had approached the state government with a request to depute doctors to the city to handle the Covid-19 patients admitted in hospitals. Earlier, during the first wave, doctors from Vadodara had been deputed to other hospitals including those in Ahmedabad. Officer on special duty for Covid-19 Vinod Rao said that 47 resident doctors were earmarked for the GMERS Hospital in Gotri by the health department. These include 32 resident doctors from Gandhinagar and 15 from Bhavnagar. At the SSG Hospital, an additional number of post-graduate students have been roped in for duty in the Covid wards. The administration has also started enrolling nursing Sahayaks for Covid duties. These include 78 at the SSG Hospital and 64 others at the GMERS Hospital at Gotri. In an attempt to handle any crisis, a round-the-clock control room has been started outside the Covid-19 ICU in the GMERS Hospital. A biomedical engineer, a fireman, an electrician and other technicians and workers will remain present in the control room. A fire drill was conducted at the SSG Hospital on Tuesday. A similar exercise will be done at the GMERS Hospital within a week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/resident-docs-from-other-dists-deputed-to-vadodara/articleshow/81765329.cms||---
---||Delhi||CM, Swiss envoy discusstourism, curbing pollution||New Delhi: Ambassador of Switzerland Dr Ralf Heckner in a meeting with chief minister Arvind Kejriwal at Delhi secretariat on Tuesday praised the steps taken by Delhi government to manage Covid-19 despite the difficult circumstances. They also discussed promotion of tourism and dealing with pollution in the capital. Kejriwal said the government ensured that there was no shortage of beds even when the pandemic was at its peak in the city. “Delhi government adopted home isolation for normal patients, while those who had serious infection were admitted to hospitals. Home isolation was very successful and later it was adopted in other states,” he added. Elaborating on Delhi government’s Covid-19 management model, the CM said an app was launched to get information about vacant beds in hospitals easily. “The app helped people a lot and there was no shortage of beds,” added Kejriwal. Discussing the measures being taken to tackle pollution, Kejriwal stressed that Delhi government was serious about the issue and several steps had been taken in this regard, including implementing a progressive electric vehicle policy. “Delhi government is taking the support of IIT-Kanpur, IIT-Delhi and The Energy and Resources Institute to combat pollution. Both IITs have developed a technology that allows one to identify the actual source of pollution at certain places during a specific period. Knowing the source will make it easy to take necessary steps. A pilot project is being done at many hotspots,” said Kejriwal. Expressing the need for cooperation to promote tourism in Delhi, the CM told Heckner that Delhi government was working on a number of schemes. He also discussed investment by Swiss companies working in the tourism sector. The CM also told Heckner about the Health Information Management System, which would connect all hospitals in Delhi with each other. Each citizen would be issued a health card detailing their medical history, which would help doctors treat them easily. Patients would also be able to take appointments and meet doctors without standing in queues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cm-swiss-envoy-discusstourism-curbing-pollution/articleshow/81768172.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Pandemic up close: Time spent in a Covid facility provides sobering lessons||She was a young woman, presumably in her twenties. When she walked into the ‘Reception’ area wearing a mask like everyone else, she barely drew notice. But soon it was painfully obvious that she was among those who needed immediate help. She could not keep her head up. With slow steps she made her way to the adjoining ‘Triage’ section, sat down and rested her face against a table while a person with her told the doctor about her condition. Some time later, she was in a chair outside in the corridor waiting to be wheeled into an ICU, staring blankly with eyes wide open from the strain of her laboured breathing. For many of us who are more fortunate to be insulated from its effects, the pandemic ebbs and crests in numbers. The faces behind the toll and the struggles undertaken to save lives rarely enter our consciousness, unless one hears of a tragic casualty or a miraculous recovery in our own social circles. In my case, the severity of it hit home last week when I visited a 1,050-bed Covid care facility—one of the largest in the region—to admit a relative. Strangely enough, it is difficult to be prepared for a sight such as the one at Saket Global Hospital. For one, it is located at a distance from the bustle of Thane city, off Saket Road, in a quiet area surrounded by marshes and largely free of development. There is virtually no other structure around it for a long way; and the road abutting it sees little traffic. The building, its yellow ochre-coloured coat still fresh, is less than a year old, but nondescript in most ways except size. Ten storeys tall, the only warning of the battles within comes from the signage hanging over it saying it is a Covid hospital that belongs to the Thane Municipal Corporation and credits MMRDA, MCHI and Cidco as partners. As you approach, the entrance has gates and security guards who make a vain bid to regulate movement. The sheer number of vehicles, patients and relatives that formed a steady stream in and out in the 90-100 minutes that I was there can only suggest it is an impossible task. Many were brought in with oxygen masks on stretchers in Omni taxis resembling makeshift ambulances. Suddenly, it looked like a war zone. In fact, the ambulance driver who transported my relative to the facility said he was already booked for three more such trips in Thane. He got there, deposited the patient, collected a lunch box, and quickly left for the next address. Past the gate and the corridor, the door opened into a section where visitors register patients using Aadhar cards. TMC has a young and obliging team to sort out formalities for admission into one of the many units in a facility spread over 1.5lakh sq ft. The wait for a doctor’s examination, however, is longer because of the spike that the 250-member staff is dealing with amidst a second wave. ‘Reception’ was crammed with patients, health workers, and those who had come to drop off someone or inquire about an in-house patient. Despite the tension, there were no arguments or raised voices. ‘Triage’ next door looked like the place where all the action was—oxygen tanks were being wheeled in, patients sat in a line waiting for their turn, men and women in PPE suits exchanged notes or examined the latest arrival. Many like us lingered around, unsure if we should leave our friend or relative behind unattended. As the crowd swelled, a middle-aged man walked in and gently began inquiring with people about their reasons for being there. He was the deputy municipal commissioner in charge. Finally, he came up to us and said in an urgent tone, “The patient is now my responsibility. Please leave…before you catch the virus. This is not a place where you should spend so much time.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/pandemic-up-close-time-spent-in-a-covid-facility-provides-sobering-lessons/articleshow/81768184.cms||Sunil Nair

Sukhchain and Inderjit entered into an argument and Inderjit threatened him that he had two rifles, but Sukhchain told him that they don’t want to fight and he was ready to ‘touch his feet’ and apologise, but Inderjit stood up and went from there,” he tolf the cops. Jagjeet further said later Sukhvir and Inderjit called them to the Siswan T-point. “Upon seeing us, Sukhvir was told that Satnam should apologise to Inderjit and he should ‘touch his feet’, failing which he should be shot. Sukhvir then stood up and pointed a gun at Satnam and told him to touch Inderjit’s feet. When he refused, he shot him in the chest and also shot me in the arm,” added Jagjeet. Later, the groups entered into a quarrel. The cops rushed Satnam to the PGI, where doctors declared him brought dead.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/youth-shot-dead-for-refusing-to-touch-feet-and-apologise/articleshow/81765850.cms||---

And not only this, it has been observed that most of the respiratory illnesses, which are transmitted by droplets, including sneezing, cough etc., have been reduced after wearing masks. “Though it has no evidence till now, hypothetically it is claimed that masks can also reduce the transmission of tuberculosis,” said Prof Meenu Singh, paediatrician, who mainly sees respiratory illness in children at the PGI. There have been systematic reviews that inferred that the use of masks is associated with a protective gear against respiratory infections in healthcare facilities, in long-term care facilities and at mass gatherings. “We have not done any random control trial, but this is based on observation that fewer respiratory illness has been reported during the winters among those, who covered their face,” said a public health expert at the PGI. He said, “There is a need to study such observations which can help the general population and policy makers in implementing use of face masks even for other respiratory illnesses.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/masks-offer-70-protection-against-virus/articleshow/81765862.cms||Shimona Kanwar

Anil suffered head injuries and died. Ranvijay has been arrested while police has been deployed in the village as a precautionary measure.” Villagers said that Anil had been staying in Ahmedabad for a long time to earn livelihood by working in a denim manufacturing unit. About a week ago he returned to the village and started canvassing after announcing that he would contest the panchayat election. His decision irked many people, including Ranvijay as they had already been working for months to boost their prospects in the polls. Police said that on Monday evening, Anil had been called by Ranvijay for a feast and they were consuming liquor.

The DC directed the SDM to identify housing societies and service industries for increasing vaccination coverage, and prepare a seven-day schedule for the vaccination drive. “Increase testing, judicious use of RAT should also be increased to 30%. Reach out to targeted population like students and teachers of government schools etc. Action should be taken by all the SDMs and civil surgeon,” said the DC. He asked all the SDMs and civil surgeon to identify places where mobile Covid-19 vaccination centres can be created, such as police lines, colleges and universities, bigger industrial units, bus stands and railway stations, PRTC/Punjab roadways bus depots, market places etc. to ramp up the drive. All the eligible government employees and other categories, which he had requested for inclusion in the vaccine coverage (such as judges, teachers etc.), should be facilitated in getting vaccination, said Dayalan. Notably, the latest data shows that the UK strain of the virus is the most prevalent in the state. While 326 of the 401 Covid-19 positive samples sent initially to the NCDC for genome sequencing were found positive for the UK variant, subsequently of the 95 samples sent to the IGIB, 85 were found to be positive for the same. Dayalan said the health experts have predicted that the number would decrease by mid or late May 2021, which suggests that the Mohali district is expected to contribute more cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mohali-to-set-up-vaccine-centres-at-housing-societies-indl-units/articleshow/81765858.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

If citizens follow the restrictions proposed till April 8, we can break the chain of Covid infection,” he said. In a revised order, the district administration on Monday postponed the implementation of curbs by 24 hours. As per modified guidelines, all fuel outlets will remain open for public from 8 am till noon. Earlier, fuel supply was allowed only for essential services and vehicles belonging to government services. As per revised order, hotels and restaurants can offer home-delivery of food till 8 pm whereas students appearing for different exams can venture out by carrying hall tickets with them. Earlier on Tuesday morning, Chavan held a meeting with different public representatives and sought their co-operation in containing the spread of the pandemic by way of imposing curbs. Speaking on the occasion, local BJP MLA Atul Save said that a regular dialogue between public representatives and the district administration was must to tide over the pandemic situation. “While many needy and poor may find it difficult to make ends meet, the district administration should explore the option of community kitchen to serve such underprivileged population,” he said. Meanwhile, city MP Imtiaz Jaleel raised the issue of vacant posts at different government-run health institutions, including GMCH. “ Many doctors refused to join GMCH and other health establishments in Aurangabad and the license of such doctors must be cancelled,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/follow-curbs-to-arrest-pandemic-collector/articleshow/81765123.cms||---

The administration has not submitted any proposal for extension of the deadline, said a senior UT official. “However, UT administrator VP Singh Badnore will take a final call on it,” the official added. The last deadline had ended on March 31, 2020. As lockdown was in force, the UT had decided not to impose any penalty on residents and had extended the last date till March 31, 2021. The Union government last year had notified the new subsidy scheme for rooftop solar units. Under it, the subsidy amount has been raised from 30% to 40% for panels up to 3 kWp capacity. For solar units from 4kWp to 10kWp, the subsidy will be 20%. The same has been adopted by the UT administration. There will be no subsidy for plants above 10kWp. Earlier, 30% subsidy was given to all applicants irrespective of the capacity of the plant. In a notification issued on May 18, 2016, the administration had made installation of rooftop solar power plants mandatory in residential properties measuring 500 sq yd and above and group housing societies. There are around 10,000 such houses in different parts of the city, including sectors 8 (417 houses), 11 (493 houses), 33 (643 houses), 35 (419 houses) and 36 (417 houses).  Those who fail to install solar power plants despite directions of the UT administration will be served notices by the UT estate office.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/deadline-for-solar-plant-installation-ends-today/articleshow/81765868.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

The differing statements by deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam that the government decision was only “a provisional arrangement” and that by PMK founder S Ramadoss that it was “permanent” are bound to cause some embarrassment to the AIADMK and provide ammunition to the rival front led by the DMK. Ramadsoss on Tuesday asserted that the quota law was “permanent” and that his party would also ensure that a new bill was tabled and passed in the assembly to enhance the vanniyar quota after a caste census was carried out. He was reacting to a statement by OPS in an interview to a newspaper. The bitter fight on quota politics comes against the backdrop of black flag protests and stiff resistance to the ruling AIADMK by the influential piramalai kallars and maravars, the influential sub-sects of thevars, who were until recently reaping the benefits of 20% MBC quota in government jobs and education. OPS and his colleagues, Dindigul C Sreenivasan, Sellur K Raju and R B Udayakumar belong to these groups and have been avoiding any mention of the quota sop during electioneering. With AMMK led by T T V Dhinakaran putting up a strong fight in many of the southern constituencies where there is a concentration of thevars, the divisions within the AIADMK alliance over the vanniyar reservation issue may come in handy for him too. In a statement on Tuesday afternoon, Ramadoss said, “When I spoke to the chief minister over phone just a while ago, he assured me that the law enacted for the vanniyar quota was permanent and there was no law that was interim. The chief minister is very clear.” He alleged that ‘certain people with lack of understanding’ on social justice were calling the quota interim and indulging in mischievous propaganda. Ramadoss said he was determined to secure internal quota for other communities as well. The EPS government tabled the bill on the last day of the assembly session in February, minutes before the model code came into force. Minister Udayakumar, who is seeking reelection from Thirumangalam assembly segment, said last week while campaigning in his constituency that the law enacted by the AIADMK government would “last only six months”. “I promise the quota would be extended only after a new caste census is carried out,” the minister said. Governor Banwarilal Purohit had given assent to the bill the same day it was passed and the PMK struck a poll deal with the AIADMK shortly after that. With the caste dynamics weighing heavily on the election, the AIADMK-led front has given poll tickets to 42 vanniyar and 37 mukkulathor candidates, the highest among all communities. It is no different in the DMK front too. “The ruling AIADMK has given slightly more number of seats to mukkulathor this time than the previous polls to overcome the challenges from V K Sasikala and Dhinakaran. The 10.5% quota is a calculated risk taken by the AIADMK. It is a gamble, a double-edged sword,” said R Subash of Forum for Real Social Justice and Inclusion||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/pmk-leader-rebuffs-ops-asserts-vanniyar-quota-isnt-provisional/articleshow/81768173.cms||Julie Mariappan
---||Chandigarh||‘Booklet on Big Ag reply to Narendra Singh Tomar ’||BATHINDA: The farmer unions have come out with a booklet to tell central agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar what he has been asking them: “Krishi kanuno me kala kya (what’s black in the farm laws)?” Based on an identical title by senior lawyer Joginder Singh Toor, the booklet released on Holi at Delhi’s agitation site of Singhu border also calculates the minimum support price (MSP) of various crops. A part of its text is from ‘How Big Ag ate up America’—inferences of US-based IITian Bedabrata Pain’s 10,000-kilometre road trip across America to find how its small farmers had gone down since the US opened its agriculture sector to the corporates. The farmer unions have printed 10,000 copies of the 84-pages booklet for distribution. Farmer unionist Gurnam Singh Charuni said: “The agriculture ministers has asked us repeatedly to point out what we see as black in the laws, and even though we have answered clause by clause, repeatedly, now we have a written document of answers.” Farmer unionist Jagmohan Singh said: Now it’s time for Tomar to answer our question: ‘What is of farmers’ benefit in these laws?” Charuni said: “Toor’s contribution is to explain legal flaws in the laws. For instance, for decades the MSP was fixed far below the input cost, even as the committee of farm scientist M S Swaminathan recommended 50% profit over input cost by adding all the elements. The central government claims to have put these laws on hold for 18 months, while we challenge its very jurisdiction on the subject of making these laws. If we agree to the amendments, it’ll be like accepting the government’s jurisdiction on the farm sector, which is what we oppose.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/booklet-on-big-ag-reply-to-tomar/articleshow/81768185.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Business||Newage insurance players woo startups with corporate health plans||Hyderabad: While large corporates offer group health insurance cover to their employees and this accounts for a major business segment for insurers, the steady rise in the number of startups has opened a new market opportunity for general insurers to tap in the Covid-era. With around 55,000 startups, India is touted to be the third largest startup hub globally after the US and China. Abhishek Poddar, co-founder & CEO, Plum, a Bengaluru-based group health insurance startup that specialises in group health cover, pointed out that startups are generally not able to access high-quality group insurance plans because these plans are traditionally built for companies with a large number of employees and are expensive. Also, startups don’t have large HR teams to help employees with the claims process. “Plum has come up with new underwriting and fraud detection algorithms to enable companies as small as five employees to benefit from group insurance for as low as Rs 85 per month. We have built an integrated digital claims experience that allows employees to initiate their claims in less than five minutes without any help from HR,” Poddar said. He added that Plum expects to serve around 3,000 startups by December and eventually cater to 50,000 in the next two years. Kapil Mehta, CEO, SecureNow Insurance Broker, pointed out that startups struggle to buy group health insurance for employees because they are generally smaller than the minimum group size that insurers require. SecureNow has addressed this issue by working with several insurers to provide health insurance to groups of as small as 20 people. “Because of the leverage we have with insurers we are able to offer these health insurance products at affordable rates. The costs can be as low as Rs 2,500 per person insured,” he said, adding that the demand for health insurance from startups has been very high and around 1,000 startups have bought group health insurance from them. He said during last year, the focus was to get Covid covers but now the requirement is more broad-based. He also added that SecureNow offers startups many other value-added services such as access to doctors for one-on-one consultation. Ravi Narayan, CEO of Telangana government-backed incubator T-Hub, said startups strive to bag funding and cannot afford to pay employees the same benefits as other companies. “It is recommended that startups, that primarily have employees in the younger age groups, should offer flexible health benefits, ranging from gym sessions to mental health programmes with access to some insurance purchased through an aggregator.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/newage-insurance-players-woo-startups-with-corporate-health-plans/articleshow/81767016.cms||Swati Rathor

Few of the older boys have been shifted to a shelter in Chomu which is closer to their school. After being rescued from the illegally run ashram, the boys had been residing at a shelter in Virat Nagar which was far from the school. While the shelter’s office bearers approached the commission to return the boys, they had no answer to why there were no boys at the shelter who were from Rajasthan and only from north-east.Sangeeta Beniwal, chairperson, Rajasthan State Commission for Protection of Child Rights said, “As few of the senior boys are taking exams, we thought it best not to disturb them at present by sending them back home. Once examinations are over, our officials will meet the boys again and start formalities for sending them to their native homes. Already 25 boys have expressed their willingness to go back home while two want to continue their studies here.”The minor boys are all from northeast states like Nagaland, Assam and others. Officials claimed that the ashram was being run by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and they suspected it to be a case of child trafficking.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rescued-boys-from-juvenile-centre-to-go-home-after-exams/articleshow/81768194.cms||---

---||Mumbai||‘Ready to begin trials in Pansare, Dabholkar cases’ in Mumbai||Mumbai: Even as agencies probing the killings of rationalist Narendra Dabholkar and CPI leader Govind Pansare informed they were ready to proceed with the trials, Bombay HC on Tuesday said it would continue to monitor investigations. “If this (killings) is to happen in a modern state like Maharashtra, certainly this court is concerned about it. Therefore this court will keep on monitoring the investigations,” said a bench of Justices S S Shinde and Manish Pitale. On pleas by their families, the HC is monitoring the CBI probe into Dabholkar’s death in August 2013 in Pune and the SIT of state police probe into Pansare’s death in Kolhapur in February 2015. On March 13, the agencies were rapped after their advocate Abhay Nevagi said trial had started in Karnataka where journalist Gauri Lankesh and Kannada writer MM Kalburgi were killed much later. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh for CBI said trial has not commenced in Karnataka. “In our case, we had filed a petition for stay on the trial as investigation was in progress. We have withdrawn it today. The stay is vacated (by HC single judge). We are ready to proceed with the trial,” he added. Special counsel Ashok Mundargi for SIT said it had also withdrawn its petition and they were ready to go ahead with the trial. The judges said it is better the trials begin than remain pending for years. When Nevagi said two accused in the Pansare case were absconding, Justice Shinde said, “We won’t stop the trial because the accused are absconding. The killings took place in 2013 and 2015. We are in 2021.” Mundargi said they were the shooters and “efforts to find them will certainly continue.” Adjourning the hearing to April 15, the judges noted that CBI and SIT have said they will not stop investigations. “We are not disposing of these petitions. We will go to the root of the matter… We don’t want even the slightest doubt that investigation is not done properly,” said Justice Shinde.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/ready-to-begin-trials-in-pansare-dabholkar-cases-in-mumbai/articleshow/81768223.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Chandigarh||Mohali civic body proposes over Rs 148-crore budget||MOHALI: With no new taxes and no fresh projects, the Mohali municipal corporation proposed an over Rs 148-crore budget. It has proposed an estimated expenditure of Rs 146.63 crore against total income of Rs 148.71 crore, thereby showing a surplus of Rs 2 crore for the 2021-22 fiscal. The annual budget awaits the approval of the special house meet, which has been delayed as the civic body still awaits its constitution. The notification for the elections of mayor, senior deputy mayor and deputy mayor is also yet to be announced, and sources said it might be issued in the first week of April. In 2020-21, the MC had passed a budget of Rs 286.72-crore income against Rs 251.66 crore expenditure with Rs 17.06-crore surplus. However, it had included Rs 100 crore to be recovered from GMADA for maintenance of various parks, but managed to get only Rs 25 crore and Rs 75 crore are pending. It was in 2020-21 that the MC had proposed a surplus budget after four years of deficit one. In 2019-20, MC had proposed Rs 22.2-crore deficit budget and in 2018, Rs 15-crore deficit. However, the MC later managed to reduce the deficit to half by increasing the income. In 2017, the MC had passed the annual budget with an estimated expenditure of Rs 138.5 crore against projected income of 117.5 crore, making a deficit of Rs 21 crore. MC commissioner Kamal Kumar Garg said, “We will be focusing on balancing the fiscal deficit by increasing collection from various factors, like building application fee, licence fee and tehbazari. This can give us a boost of around Rs 10 crore.” The target of income of Rs 28 crore is proposed from property tax, including fire cess, which is the highest income head apart from the Punjab municipal funds of Rs 60 crore. Income generated from advertisements is increased by Rs 1 crore. Last year, the estimated income generation via advertisement tax was proposed at Rs 11 crore, and this time it has been planned at Rs 12 crore. According to the MC commissioner, tax on advertisement can be increased or decreased by the house at any time. The primary source of income, property tax, has been decreased by Rs 2 crore, with an estimated collection of Rs 28 crore. The property tax target for the financial year 2020-21 was increased by Rs 5 crore at Rs 30 crore, which during 2019-20 fiscal was decreased by Rs 2.5 crore at Rs 25 crore. Similarly, additional excise duty remains the same at Rs 3 crore as in 2020-21 fiscal. Rent and tehbazari fee income is pegged at Rs 60 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mohali-civic-body-proposes-over-rs-148-crore-budget/articleshow/81765872.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

The two were addressing a press conference on the Arvind Kejriwal government's new excise policy. Gupta said that under the policy, new liquor shops would be opened in all areas of the capital. “BJP will oppose it tooth and nail and not allow any new shop to come up. It seems the government is the victim of those foreign powers, which want to destroy the youth power of the country,” Gupta said. Bidhuri said, if the new excise policy was not withdrawn, BJP would gherao offices of the lieutenant governor and the AAP government. AAP in a statement said, “BJP functionaries are spearheading the liquor mafia. They know that the recently initiated policy will destroy their business and hence, they are fretting over it. The policy will act as a deterrent for illicit liquor operations.” TNN||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bjp-warns-of-protest-against-excise-policy/articleshow/81768205.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Chief minister Ashok Gehlot, former PCC president and deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot and AICC general secretary Ajay Maken were present in the nomination functions and addressed rallies. Chief minister sought vote for development. He said by electing the ruling party, the voters would strengthen the government in its resolve to continue with the good work. It will send a message to bureaucracy as well to pull up its socks and deliver. He alleged that democracy and free speech is in danger under the BJP rule at the Centre. Gehlot said that the state is launching registration of universal health insurance cover from April 1 under which Rs 5 lakh medical insurance cover will be provided to all. Similarly, he said that those higher secondary schools that have more than 500 girl students will be upgraded to colleges to promote girls’ education. The CM accused the BJP of thriving on spreading rumours on social media. He added that it should be taught a lesson on the ill-treatment meted out to farmers who have been agitating against the farm laws for the last four months. Congress has fielded late former minister Bhanwarlal Meghwal’s son, Manoj Meghwal from the Sujangarh assembly seat which fell vacant after his death last year. Manoj Meghwal is pitted against BJP leader and former minister Khemaram Meghwal. Bhanwarlal Meghwal, who was the state social justice and empowerment minister, died of brain stroke in November last year. For the Sahada assembly constituency, the ruling Congress has fielded Gayatri Devi against BJP candidate and former MLA Ratanlal Jat. This seat fell vacant after Gayatri Devi’s husband Kailash Trivedi died in October after being infected with Covid-19. Tansukh Bohara will contest from Rajsamand, which fell vacant after BJP MLA Kiran Maheshwari died due to Covid complications in November last year.

The HC has issued notices to the government and other respondents. Through counsel Mir Nagman Ali, the petitioners Asgar Kadar Sheikh and Mohd Yakub Nagul prayed for release in view of amendment to the ‘Bombay Parole and Furlough Rules’ enabling prisoners to be released to contain the spread of Covid-19 inside jails. Both petitioners lodged in Central Jail here had applied to the superintendent for releasing them, but their applications were rejected on the ground that they are convicts in special acts. The trial court in Mumbai on June 29, 2004, had convicted both along with others for carrying out five blasts — at Kanjurmarg station, near Virar station, on railway tracks between Goregaon and Malad, near Santacruz railway station, and on platform number 2 at Kandivali station — between January 23 and February 27, 1998. The blasts had killed four persons and left 30 others injured.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/2-mumbai-blasts-accused-move-hc-for-parole/articleshow/81768211.cms||---

---||---||West Bengal assembly elections: Why all netas are focusing on Nandigram-II, not Nandigram-I||NANDIGRAM: The battle for Nandigram, the most closely contested seat in this assembly election, is being fought on only half the pitch with both Trinamool candidate Mamata Banerjee and BJP’s Suvendu Adhikari focusing their energies on Nandigram II block. Even CPM candidate Minakshi Mukherjee spent most of her time campaigning in Nandigram II and visited Nandigram I villages only for a few days. It is the war in block II that will determine the outcome of the Nandigram battle. Both Adhikari and Banerjee are vying for a share of the Hindu-majority electorate in this half of the constituency. Desperate to garner as much Hindu vote share as he can, Adhikari’s speeches increasingly targeted the Muslim community in a bid to polarise the electorate, while Banerjee dug her heels in Nandigram II, in a bid to woo Hindu voters and prevent Adhikari from taking the share for granted. The reason why neither has spent much time in Nandigram I block is very different. Met with stiff resistance from Muslims, who comprise nearly a third of the population there, Adhikari has not been able to campaign in the area. He had attempted to enter Nandigram II to inaugurate a puja on a morning four days ago, but was forced to delay the visit by several hours after learning women, wielding slippers and brooms, had assembled to drive him away. The revival of cases against those who had participated in the farmland agitation, such as Abu Sufian, has also reportedly angered people in Nandigram I as they apparently believe Adhikari had a hand in getting the cases revived. The only political flags visible in this block are those of Trinamool. Locals believed BJP might even find it challenging to field polling agents there, perhaps the reason why the party moved the EC with the request to appoint agents from elsewhere in the state. Read AlsoDidi Vs Dada in Nandigram: Stage set for the big fight• 11am, Reyapara, Nandigram:  Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee heads to Bhangaberia for her roadshow. BJP supporters gathered for Union home minister Amit Shah’s roadshow raise the ‘Jai Shri Ram’ war cry; some of them chase her vehicle but it does not stop. Play it ‘thanda-thanda cool-cool’,With the BJP being unable to penetrate into Nandigram block I, which has nearly 60% of the voting population in the assembly seat, RSS appears to have quietly stepped in. Triangular ‘Jai Sri Ram’ flags strung up in Hindu-dominated villages, such as Maheshpur, Tekhali and Gokulnagar, bear witness to a subtle attempt to appeal to Hindu voters, along with Adhikari’s shrill anti-Muslim rhetoric in the other half of Nandigram in a bid to polarize the electorate. Read AlsoYou broke BJP in bid to split TMC: Mamata Banerjee to Amit ShahChief minister Mamata Banerjee’s statement that “Mukul Suvendu r motoh baje noy (Mukul is not as bad as Suvendu)” as election campaigning ended in Nandigram on Tuesday has added a fresh twist to the political script in Bengal.Banerjee found it prudent to focus on Nandigram II as her campaign managers are confident of securing a lion’s share of the 53,000-plus Muslim votes and a section of the Hindu vote in the block. Breaking into the Hindu vote share in places, such as Reyapara, Birulia, Boyal and Khodambari in Nandigram II, is critical for Banerjee as the Muslim vote there is only around 11,000. By choosing to stay in Nandigram II, holding rallies, carrying out door-to-door campaigns and visiting temples, Banerjee has reached out to voters in Adhikari’s core support base. Whatever votes she is able to garner from there will be vital in the fight against the son of the soil.

Reyapara has always been a Left stronghold. A rally by CPM leader Md Salim and ISF’s Abbas Siddiqui in Nandigram II that tried to drum up support for Mukherjee was followed keenly by the Adhikari camp that realized any split in the Muslim vote share would give him an advantage in this contest.

The DC directed the SDM to identify housing societies and service industries for increasing vaccination coverage, and prepare a seven-day schedule for the vaccination drive. “Increase testing, judicious use of RAT should also be increased to 30%. Reach out to targeted population like students and teachers of government schools etc. Action should be taken by all the SDMs and civil surgeon,” said the DC. He asked all the SDMs and civil surgeon to identify places where mobile Covid-19 vaccination centres can be created, such as police lines, colleges and universities, bigger industrial units, bus stands and railway stations, PRTC/Punjab roadways bus depots, market places etc. to ramp up the drive. All the eligible government employees and other categories, which he had requested for inclusion in the vaccine coverage (such as judges, teachers etc.), should be facilitated in getting vaccination, said Dayalan. Notably, the latest data shows that the UK strain of the virus is the most prevalent in the state. While 326 of the 401 Covid-19 positive samples sent initially to the NCDC for genome sequencing were found positive for the UK variant, subsequently of the 95 samples sent to the IGIB, 85 were found to be positive for the same. Dayalan said the health experts have predicted that the number would decrease by mid or late May 2021, which suggests that the Mohali district is expected to contribute more cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mohali-to-set-up-vaccine-centres-at-housing-societies-indl-units/articleshow/81765907.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

All the eight accused have been identified as Sukhvir Singh alias Billa, Jagroop Singh, Jaggi, Gagni, Prinsa, Sheela, Bindi and Inderjit Singh alias Inder. The police said Sukhvir is the main accused in the case as he opened fire at the youth with his licenced pistol. Jagjeet Singh, relative of the deceased, was also shot at on his arm. He reported to the cops that his relative Satnam Singh met him along with Sukhchain Singh three days ago and they told him to come to Mullanpur to celebrate holi. “I came on Monday afternoon and we were sitting at a farmhouse where Inderjit Singh also came. Sukhchain and Inderjit entered into an argument and Inderjit threatened him that he had two rifles, but Sukhchain told him that they don’t want to fight and he was ready to ‘touch his feet’ and apologise, but Inderjit stood up and went from there,” he tolf the cops. Jagjeet further said later Sukhvir and Inderjit called them to the Siswan T-point. “Upon seeing us, Sukhvir was told that Satnam should apologise to Inderjit and he should ‘touch his feet’, failing which he should be shot.

A resident of Baadigaon, Bhagirathi Devi was trapped in the wildfire. According to officials, she sustained 75% burn injuries. Villagers had rushed Bhagirathi to nearest Community Health Centre in Didihaat. But owing to inadequate medical aid, she was then referred to Haldwani Medical College, where she succumbed to her injuries. Her post-mortem was conducted on Sunday and body handed over to the family. This was the fifth casualty reported due to jungle fires in the last six months. On February 10, in Pauri district’s Lavintha village, Harimohan (51), a forest guard and Dinesh Lal (55), a forester, slipped down from the cliff while dousing flames and died due to head injuries in the absence of adequate fire extinguishing kits. On January 24 and January 28 this year, two women Hema Devi (24) and Saraswati Devi (60) Almora, died when a fire broke in the forests of Matena village. They both succumbed to burn injuries during treatment. Uttarakhand has lost 1,085 hectares of forest area in 828 wildfire incidents in the past six months.

---||Goa||Health dept looks to target 3L people in next phase||Panaji: The response to the health department’s vaccinationation drive continues to remain slow, with little over 1 lakh citizens having received the shot till Tuesday. Those covered by the vaccine include healthcare workers (HCW), frontline workers (FLW), citizens in the sixty-plus age group and people in the ages 45 to 59 having comorbidities. The health services will commence vaccinating those above 45 years from April 1 and has set a target of 3 lakh people. However, the tepid response to the ongoing drive has left the department worried. Experts believe that if the response doesn’t show a marked improvement shortly, it will be several months before the target population receives the jab. “We hope that once the next phase of vaccination opens from April 1, more people will come forward,” a health official said. In addition, to over 30 health centres and government-run hospitals, 31 private hospitals have joined the drive. A major stumbling block in the vaccination drive has been people’s reluctance and misconceptions about the vaccine despite a mass awareness campaign undertaken by the government since January. A well-informed senior citizen from Vasco, who has comorbidities, said he was yet to take the shot. “I don’t know if I will take it. What’s the point? An acquaintance from Mumbai got Covid after he was administered the first shot,” he said, sharing his reason for being reluctant in taking the vaccine. A senior Goa Medical College doctor said that it has been repeatedly emphasised that people can get the infection after the first dose, as it takes time for the system to develop antibodies. “That’s why people are requested to take precautions after vaccination and after the booster dose, for 14 days,” the doctor said. “There have been cases of people contracting the virus after the first dose. Some have even got it after the second dose. The relief for those who have been vaccinated is that even if they get Covid-19, their infection will be mild, and their chances of recovery are faster and without needing hospitalisation,” the doctor added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/health-dept-looks-to-target-3l-people-in-next-phase/articleshow/81768203.cms||---

The university has, however, said that it helped that 95% of syllabus had been completed by teachers before the lockdown last year, which helped complete the programmes. “Goa University started its even semester on November 18, 2019, and the teaching was to end on April 3, 2020. By the time lockdown started the syllabus was over by 95%. The remaining syllabus was completed by the faculty members during the lockdown by conducting online classes through Google Classroom or by sharing recorded lectures,” GU has said. The varsity also said that its vice-chancellor constituted a ‘Digital Transition Committee’ to explore and evaluate various online teaching as well as proctored examination platforms. “Goa University Library conducted a survey among the students on the adaptability to e-learning taking 540 students as a sample. Based on the inputs of the online survey, the online mode of teaching and learning was continued. Apart from this, directorate of digital learning and initiatives (DDLI) started recording lectures and also helping the directorate of higher education, Goa government, to record the lectures for undergraduate programmes,” the university has stated. DDLI has also trained all the university teachers and about 300 affiliated college teachers who would serve as trainers on OBS Studio, a free platform for recording lectures, GU has said in the data submitted for the NIRF ranking.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gu-pandemic-delayed-exams-by-3-months/articleshow/81768214.cms||---

Three organs of a 62-year-old deceased donor were successfully harvested and allotted to patients on the wait list. Two kidneys harvested of the deceased donor were transplanted into two persons under the kidney transplant programme of the State Organ Tissue Transplant Organisation (SOTTO). The liver was allotted to a patient at IKDRC hospital, Ahmedabad in Gujarat. Health minister Vishwajit Rane, tweeting about GMC’s latest achievement, said SOTTO was dedicated to achieving maximum organ utilisation and minimise the organ wastage. Rane said the 62-year-old woman was admitted to GMC for subarachnoid haemorrhage, and after a clinical diagnosis was declared brain dead. “Her family stepped forward and requested for organ donation of the deceased. Their gestures have saved three precious lives,” he said. In December 2020, GMC under its SOTTO programme, harvested five organs - two kidneys, liver, heart and lungs - from a 21-year-old man who had died in an accident and was declared brain dead. His two kidneys were used for two patients in GMC, while the other three organs were allotted to patients outside the state since Goa does not have facilities to conduct other organ transplants. The GMC plans to start transplants of other organs such as liver, but it will be possible once the new super-speciality block is commissioned, the whole department is set up and consultants are appointed. Presently, GMC doesn’t have consultants to conduct liver transplant, nor other necessary staff.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gmc-harvests-three-organs-from-deceased-woman/articleshow/81768220.cms||---

And not only this, it has been observed that most of the respiratory illnesses, which are transmitted by droplets, including sneezing, cough etc., have been reduced after wearing masks. “Though it has no evidence till now, hypothetically it is claimed that masks can also reduce the transmission of tuberculosis,” said Prof Meenu Singh, paediatrician, who mainly sees respiratory illness in children at the PGI. There have been systematic reviews that inferred that the use of masks is associated with a protective gear against respiratory infections in healthcare facilities, in long-term care facilities and at mass gatherings. “We have not done any random control trial, but this is based on observation that fewer respiratory illness has been reported during the winters among those, who covered their face,” said a public health expert at the PGI. He said, “There is a need to study such observations which can help the general population and policy makers in implementing use of face masks even for other respiratory illnesses.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/masks-offer-70-protection-against-virus/articleshow/81765921.cms||Shimona Kanwar

Though the voters have been participating in large numbers in every election with polling percentage crossing 80% in 2014 and 2018 and over 76% in 2009, the contest remained between the two main parties. Except for K Anjaiah Yadav of TDP securing 17.2% votes in 2014, the third-placed candidates never crossed 10% polling mark in the last six elections. In 2018, the contest was mainly between K Jana Reddy of Congress and Nomula Narsimhaiah of the TRS with the latter defeating the former. While the vote share of TRS candidates was over 46 per cent, the Congress veteran got 42.04 per cent votes. The third placed candidate from BJP then got 1.48 per cent vote share. In 2014, Congress won the seat with over 42% vote share against 32.62% by TRS. Though this time too the contest looks straight between TRS and Congress, political analysts say the BJP has to put in extra effort in the next 15 days to make it a serious triangular fight. Kakatiya University political science professor (retired) B Sanjeeva Reddy said the Congress candidate has an image and a kind of aura. He has done a lot of work in the constituency which he is listing out. The ruling TRS will go all out to retain the seat. Unless the BJP comes up with a new trick up its sleeve, it will be difficult for the saffron party to put up a good show in Nagarjuna Sagar assembly constituency going to bypoll on April 17, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bjp-needs-new-strategy-for-sagar-byelection-say-experts/articleshow/81767026.cms||Roushan Ali

Students who will complete third-year BTech and BS progr-amme this year will be eligible to opt for the dual degree in 2021-22. Initially, the B-school plans to offer only 10 seats each in two specialised areas—finance and operations, said the B-school head, Professor S Narayan Rao. On completion of third year, students with a CPI (cumulative performance index) of 7 and above will be eligible for the programme. Students will be shortlisted based on their CPI and the final selection will be done after an interview process, he added. Students opting for the dual degree in management will have to earn around 102 credits over the fourth and fifth years. IIT-B director Subhasis Ch-audhuri said the decision was in line with the National Education Policy which seeks to offer diversity in education programmes. “Many of our students spend two years after completing their BTech and even dual degree to do an MBA.

With only 109 people getting discharged, the number of active cases further rose to 1,387. The death toll stands at 693. One of the deaths include a 23-year-old woman, who died due to bilateral bronchopneumonia and respiratory failure, though having no comorbidities. The other victim was a 75-year-old heart patient. Both died within 24 hours of hospitalization. According to health officials, the district is expected to record 300 fresh cases a day within a week. “The number of fresh cases has been increasing by around 10% daily, which means the district will start seeing 300 cases latest by Monday,” a senior health official said. Indicating that election related activities, mainly campaigning, are contributing to an increase in cases, the official said the health department officials expect cases to keep increasing until two weeks after April 6, the day on which the state goes to polls. It will take two weeks of incubation to show symptoms and test positive, the official added. The officials are hoping for the present spike of Covid cases to peak by April-end. “More people taking precaution measures, receiving their second dose of the vaccine and sharp reduction in movement of people will help cap the peak by the April-end and start the descent in cases,” the official said. The rising number of cases has led to officials ramping up the number of containment zones across the district. As of Tuesday, there were 30 such zones in rural areas and 51 zones in the corporation limits. “While we have ramped up containment zones, we are closing only the infected person’s floor of the apartment, closing off small gated communities of four houses or only one individual house. We do not close streets anymore,” said Dr Bharani, a public health department official. “We have ramped up collection of samples and it stood at 4,566 on Monday,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/dist-logs-207-new-cases-of-covid-19-two-deaths/articleshow/81768235.cms||---

Interestingly, the person declared dead before his actual death was a government counsel at the high court, Jodhpur and his younger brother connived with the police to declare him dead to get possession of his licensed weapon. The court gave these directions following the complaint of one Aasha Bhati stating that her husband, Bagh Singh Bhati, was Additional Government Counsel and had passed away in May 2020. “He had a licensed firearm in his name. It was learnt through information under RTI that his brother Surendra Singh had deposited his weapon to the police stating that his brother had died on October 16, 2018,” the complaint stated.The information stated further that Surendra Singh surrendered the license and submitted the weapon in the police station, the receipt of which had been given to him. In her complaint Aasha alleged that her brother-in-law Surendra connived with the then SHO Sumerdan and ASI Devaram to declare her husband dead 2 years before his actual death and falsely claimed that his weapon had been deposited, while the license continued to get renewed. She said that no documents asserting his death then were demanded by the police when Surendra approached the police claiming his brother to be dead.“When I demanded investigation into the matter, nothing was done by the police and threats were issued instead to stop me from chasing the matter,” said the complainant in her complaint.Admitting her plea, the magistrate on Tuesday gave directions to the police to register a case under sections 420, 120 B, 468, 193, 200 and 212 of IPC against Surendra Singh, the then SHO (Mahamandir) Sumerdan and ASI Devaram and submit the investigation report before the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/2-cops-declare-lawyer-dead-to-usurp-his-licensed-weapon/articleshow/81768228.cms||---

However, those found positive shall be mandatorily quarantined either at their place of stay, a government facility or at a hospital, according to the Union ministry of health and family welfare protocol,” said the Delhi airport in a statement. While it is currently not mandatory for flyers to carry an RT-PCR report for domestic travel to Delhi, the airport officials clarified that while testing was being done randomly, those who did have a negative report could present it to the government authorities to seek exemption. “If chosen, and one is carrying a report, it can be presented to seek exemption. It will be up to the discretion of the authorities to take another sample or not,” said the official. The new guidelines dated March 23 are not just applicable to the airport, but railway stations ISBTs and other alighting points for private buses too. If a passenger is found positive, they will have to be quarantined for 10 days. An official at Genestrings Diagnostic, the lab currently taking samples at departures and arrivals for international passengers, said while their process to collect samples from international passengers would continue, no samples of domestic passengers were being brought over to their labs. “The government is doing this testing on its own.

---||Goa||Goa: New edu year from June 21, teachers granted vacation||PANAJI: The academic year 2021-22 for schools in the state will start from June 21, the directorate of education (DoE) has said in a circular. It, however, made no mention of whether classes are expected to be held in the online or the physical mode from June. The DoE had earlier planned to schedule the start of the year from June 10, but subsequently agreed to teachers’ request to delay this date so that schools get the full six weeks of the vacation period prescribed by the state education rules. As such, students will now enjoy a vacation period from May 10 to June 19. Results of the final exam for the current academic year 2020-21 will be declared on May 7. As per the schedule announced for the new academic session, the Ganesh Chaturthi break will be from September 9 to 15, the mid-year Diwali vacation from October 27 to November 16 and Christmas break from December 24, 2021 to January 1, 2022. The first term of the year will end of October 26 and the second term will end on April 30, 2022, as was the norm during the pre-pandemic period. “The 1st summative/terminal examination shall be held so as to end on October 26, 2021, and the 2nd summative/terminal examination shall be held preferably before April 6, 2022. The final annual examination result shall not be declared before April 29, 2022,” the DoE has said. Formative tests can be held as per the convenience of the school, the circular has stated. Earlier this month, teachers had told the DoE that due to the delay in the academic year caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, teachers will have to continue with the state board’s Class X public exam duty up to June 2021. This would mean they would not get the six weeks of summer vacations as prescribed in the Goa State Education Rules if the new academic year starts by June 10. They had, therefore, requested to delay the start of the new academic year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/new-edu-year-from-june-21-teachers-granted-vacation/articleshow/81768233.cms||---

Joint Action Committee, Punjab Private School Association Ludhiana chapter, and many other independent associations have raised the issue. Joint Action Front, Ludhiana unit members met ADC Kamaljit Singh Bains and handed over a memorandum in which they requested Punjab chief minister to give directions to the education department to open schools as early as possible. J P Bhatt, principal of Rukmani School, Samrala Chowk and representative of the Joint Action Front said, “Due to increasing Covid cases, schools were shut down on March 18 and even board exams of various classes were postponed. We have made this demand as new dates for the beginning of the new session have to be decided and they too have to appear for offline exams. Already, due to Covid-19, schools have faced huge losses. Schools will follow all Covid protocol.” Thakur Anand, senior vice-president, Joint Action Front, Punjab said excessive use of electronic devices had harmed students. “The education department should give fresh directions over Covid-19 so that schools may open for the new session from April. In fact, maximum use of mobiles and other electronic devices have affected students’ eyesight and mental well-being.” Moreover, students also submitted a memorandum demanding opening of schools and colleges. The associations which demanded reopening of schools included All India Students Federation (AISF), Punjab Students Union (Lalkar), Punjab Students Union (Shaheed Randhawa), Punjab Radical Students Union, Punjab Students Union, Students Federation of India, Punjab Students Federation, Democratic Students Organisation and All India Research Scholars Association. Saurav Yadav, president of AISF said, “Students are losing out because online learning is not an effective alternative. It is not even practically possible for a large section of students. We students feel cheated by being deprived of many facilities of educational institutions despite paying full fees. The closure of educational institutions has already wasted a significant year of students. There is a lot of work in science, engineering, and research that is not possible without constant coordination with laboratories, libraries and teachers.” Some students said while precautions are necessary to stop Covid-19 spread, crippling terror is not a solution. Gagandeep Kaur, a member of the Student Federation said, “Caution is needed but it is not good to exaggerate it and create an atmosphere of terror. We should now get into the habit of living a normal life despite Coronavirus.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/despite-spike-in-cases-school-bodies-want-offline-classes/articleshow/81765165.cms||Mehak Jain

Bhushan said one of the key reasons for discouraging door-to-door vaccination was the challenge to manage any Adverse Event Following Immunization (AEFI), where there could be delay in reaching a health facility. Civic authorities, however, maintained they had discussed it with the Centre and even urged them to find a way to vaccinate nearly 1.4lakh people in Mumbai who are bedridden.Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said that they had made the request during a meeting after they found out that Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu had taken it almost to people’s doorsteps. “Our request has not been turned down completely. We may be allowed in due course, perhaps after a month or so,” he saidCivic chief IS Chahal took the vaccine on Tuesday. He said the number of citizens eligible for vaccination in Mumbai was around 40 lakh, of which over 11lakh have been vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/no-request-for-door-to-door-vaccine-from-maharashtra-centre/articleshow/81768255.cms||---

This is the population that is also vulnerable to complications of Covid-19. Diabetes and hypertension are the two most common co-morbidity in Covid patients, that in some cases leads to worse clinical outcomes. Almost 26% of men and women, respectively, have high or very high sugar levels and are taking medication for it, while it is 30% each for hypertension. This is as per the ministry of health and family welfare’s district health fact-sheet for 2019-20, which looked at people above the age of 15. “Born in South Asian ethnicity, we are genetically predisposed and two to three times at a higher risk of developing coronary heart disease and diabetes. The only way to fight it is by bringing in lifestyle changes sleeping seven to eight hours a day and exercising,” said Dr Jothydev Kesavadev, diabetologist, Kerala. Many studies from the state have pointed out that one in five of the population are diabetic and one in three are hypertensive. This along with poor control rates and high out-of-pocket expenditure for the management of these diseases has made Kerala a hub of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in the country. Unhealthy dietary practices and lack of physical exercise in all sections of the population irrespective of the age and economic status has contributed to the rise in lifestyle diseases with the statistics pointing that 52% of the total death in the age productive age group between 30 and 70 being due to one or other cause of NCD. “Higher prevalence of hypertension and diabetes has been known to occur in states with greater urbanization. It may be related to unhealthy lifestyle - food habits, lack of exercise, smoking and alcohol consumption,” said Kochi-based physician Dr Sheetal Binu. Rampant urbanization and modernization, which had infiltrated even to the grassroots level of the state, irrespective of the region and economic strata, influenced lifestyle of the population making the state fertile for NCDs. Now, during the post-Covid era, NCDs pose a major threat to the public health system both in terms of morbidity, mortality and economic burden it imposes. The mortality and morbidity due to lifestyle diseases now surpasses those due to communicable diseases & reproductive child health issues combined. And what has doctors concerned is that most of the patients with NCDs neither do regular checkups nor do they take the prescribed medications. “Almost 50% of the patients don’t know that they have hypertension or diabetes till they develop complications and of those who are confirmed to have NCDs many don’t take medicines prescribed to them. This later leads to complications,” said physician of Ernakulam General Hospital Dr T P Vijayan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/one-fourth-of-adults-in-dist-have-diabetes-hbp-report/articleshow/81765986.cms||Preetu Nair

As such, the state has decided to seek permission for developmental activities to be allowed in such coastal areas where fishermen reside in Goa as per the relaxation provided to fishermen villages in CRZ 2011 notification. “The Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA) decided to write to the Ministry of Environment, Forests & Climate Change (MoEF&CC) and NCZMA that in view of the peculiar circumstances prevailing in Goa, where the location of the fishermen houses are not isolated in single wards or villages, other developmental activities permissible under CRZ Notification 2011 may be permitted in areas demarcated as fishing wards/villages the Coastal Zone Management Plan (CZMP),” GCZMA has said in a decision, after discussing the issues raised by citizens pertaining to the draft CZMP for Goa. This relaxation to fishermen should reflect in the final notification of the CZMP, for which GCZMA will inform MoEF&CC and NCZMA. In the guidelines provided to states for preparation of the CZMP, in the CRZ areas, in the fishing villages, ‘common properties of the fishermen communities, fishing jetties, ice plants, fish drying platforms or area’s infrastructure facilities of fishing and local communities such as dispensaries, roads, schools, and the like shall be indicated on the cadastral scale map.’ States have also been told that in their CZMP detailed plans have to be made taking into consideration the long term expansion of these fishing villages like housing needs, facilities for sanitation, safety and disaster preparedness. “No developmental activities other than those listed shall be permitted in the areas between the hazard line and 500ms and 100ms of width of the creek on the landward side. The dwelling units of the local communities will not be relocated if the dwelling units are located on the seaward side of the hazard line,” the norms for CZMP preparation for fishing villages state. The Goa government has now sought these same relaxations for the state’s fishermen community, who are residing along the coast, even though they may not be isolated into specific fishing villages. As per the CZMP norms, the state government has to necessarily provide safeguards to the dwelling units of such fishermen located along the coast from natural disasters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-govt-to-seek-relaxation-from-centre-for-fishermen-in-coastal-plan/articleshow/81768244.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

The squad has been formed under the project HEAL Health, Environment, Agriculture and Livelihood which is aimed at giving the city a facelift. Launching the squad at Subhash Park near Marine Drive, mayor M Anil Kumar said the squad would help to ensure a mosquito-free Kochi. The workers have been posted for six months with a daily wage of Rs 670 per head. “We will also have to do cleaning works while doing mosquito eradication programmes. We had distributed leaflets last week in households in our limit,” said a contract worker. Three workers have been posted at each division. The contract workers are being selected by division councillors. While launching the squad, the contractors were given personnel protection equipment and other apparatus for implementing the programme. Four vehicle-mounted fogging machines have also been allotted. The workers were already given training in eradication programmes by vector control experts two weeks ago. Despite soaring temperature, Kaloor South, Thammanam and Ponnurunni in the corporation limits continue to witness high mosquito density. Experts say that residents should take steps to avoid creating mosquito breeding sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/special-squad-to-eradicate-mosquitoes/articleshow/81766021.cms||---

It was on this day in 1921 that a young freedom fighter Pingali Venkayya presented the draft design of the flag to Mahatma Gandhi at the All India Congress Committee (AICC) session held at Bezwada (Vijayawada). The AICC held its two-day crucial session in Vijayawada on March 31 and April 1, 1921. Besides Mahatma Gandhi, several national leaders attended the event, which is often described as a turning point in the history of India’s freedom movement. Venkayya had presented the draft design of the Congress flag, which after a few changes was adopted as the national flag just before Independence in 1947. The AICC session played a key role in mobilising funds for the freedom movement, apart from giving the Congress its party flag and later, Indians the national Tricolour. 1/6100 years ago, national flag took shape Previous NextShow Captions<p>The centenary of the first ever draft design of the Indian National Flag is on March 31.

Vijayawada was one of the five places selected for erection of Gandhi stupas. The draft design by Venkayya had two colours – green and red – with a spinning wheel or Gandhi Chakra. It was adopted as the Congress flag by replacing red with saffron and including white colour. The design of the Chakra was also changed. Later, Gandhi Chakra was replaced by Ashoka Chakra in the national flag when the design for the Tricolour was finalised. There were two events in Bezwada on March 31 and April 1, 1921. The AICC session was not a regular one. It was a special session. Also, there was the Congress Working Committee (CWC) session. Venkayya met Gandhiji and presented the design on March 31. Gandhiji had called him to meet the next day. But the CWC session was hectic and a decision the flag design was not finalised. Gandhiji took the design with him and in fact, acknowledged it in one of his editorials in Young India (April 13, 1921). While the centenary calls for a big celebration, ironically it has not received the attention it deserves. There are no celebrations or big events planned for today. The only event that took place in the city was the release of a catalogue on the AICC session, published by the AP Photography Akademi, on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/100-years-of-draft-design-of-indian-national-flag/articleshow/81767083.cms||Syed Akbar

---||Nagpur||Wedding industry nears ‘breaking point’ as clients demand refund||NAGPUR: Banquet halls, lawns and hotels say they are almost at a financial breaking point due to clients asking for refunds and landlords refusing to negotiate rent. With local administration clamping down on weddings, calls for refunds have risen in the already cash-strapped industry. Almost everyone is offering to “carry forward” the deposit to a new date.  Dilip Kamdar, director of Naivedhyam, says, “Weddings are planned minimum three to six months in advance and deposits are given to book venues. No businessman sits on that cash for six months, waiting for that wedding party. Money is infused into the business as capital investment, overheads etc.” Kamdar says that earlier, weddings were cancelled from the client’s side. “Either due to death in the family or because of marriage being called off. This is the first time that the government is calling off the entire event, but our fixed expenses remain the same. Majority of businessmen are offering credit for the event to be held at a future date,” he adds. Vinod Dande, a member of Nagpur Halls & Lawns Association, feels that their industry is being hammered from all sides. “Clients want a refund for deposits they gave a couple of months ago and the majority of us are not in a position to even pay for overheads. Those caterers who leased lawns/halls have been the worst-hit. They are paying lakhs per month in rent, electricity bills and maintenance with no income in sight,” says Dande. Jasbir Arora, director, Hotel Centre Point, says the sector in Nagpur is the worst-hit in state. “In Pune, weddings were allowed with higher capacity as compared to Nagpur, right up till March 26. There were relaxations in restaurant timings too in Pune and Mumbai. Somehow in Nagpur, it seems the most stringent rules are always for the hospitality industry,” says Arora. Dande adds, “Cash flow has stopped for us and savings are being wiped out. We are struggling to retain workers as they seek greener pastures in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. In such conditions, how can lawn owners be expected to shell out refunds for events that got called off for no fault of theirs.” Kamdar says the next couple of months may break the back of the hospitality industry. “April to June is the peak season for weddings in Nagpur and we have 30 auspicious dates as well in this period. But if the government forces us to remain shut then it’s all gone. For every 500 guests at a wedding, 100 people found direct or indirect employment. So consider that scale at a city level and understand the negative economic impact,” he explains.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/wedding-industry-nears-breaking-point-as-clients-demand-refund/articleshow/81767078.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

---||Goa||After light rain, slight drop in temperature likely this week||PANAJI: A trough that formed between Lakshadweep and coastal Karnataka two days ago triggered light rainfall in some parts of Goa, bringing relief from the increased heat and humidity amid speculation of a heat wave. Brisk rainfall for a few minutes was reported in parts of the state as the system weakened after developing into a circulation over south Maharashtra on Tuesday. Areas that received light rain included Aldona, Porvorim, Guirim and Vasco. The overcast conditions, which raised the mercury by 3.4 degrees above normal to 27.7C during morning hours, cleared by noon. After a maximum temperature of 35.5 degrees — three degrees above normal — was recorded last Friday, the mercury has slid closer to normal levels. While heat wave conditions prevailed in Ratnagiri and other places, it was higher humidity and a three-degree rise in temperature that caused discomfort in Goa. Humidity had risen between 13-16% higher than normal during the weekend and was only between 5-6% above normal on Tuesday. “We are expecting fair weather from Wednesday. Clouding will reduce and maximum temperature will go down by a degree,” Rahul M, scientist at the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Panaji, said. The maximum temperature will hover around 33-34Celsius and humidity will also remain slightly above normal. IMD has issued a warning for fishermen not to venture out to sea within 75km from the coast due to squally weather conditions, as wind is likely to blow at speeds of 40-50 km per hour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-light-rain-slight-drop-in-temperature-likely-this-week/articleshow/81768266.cms||---

Mohan along with his 10-year-old daughter had gone missing from Kochi around 9.30pm on March 21. The body of his daughter was retrieved from Muttar river on March 22. Earlier, police had identified the CCTV footage of Mohan’s car crossing the Walayar checkpost around 1.30am on March 22. Though police have expanded its probe to Tamil Nadu, they could not make any headway on that. “We have examined around 170 CCTVs installed in shops and petrol pumps situated on the stretch where Mohan’s car was expected to travel after crossing Palakkad. But we have not got any visuals regarding Sanu or his vehicle. Our investigation is progressing in Tamil Nadu. He has not withdrawn money from his bank account,” said a police officer in Thrikkakara. Meanwhile, police also collected statements of family members of Mohan on Tuesday. His relatived said that they have no information regarding the financial issues faced by Mohan. “As he has not switched on his mobile so far, we have no information on his current location,” said a senior police officer in Thrikkakara. Two teams each from Kalamassery and Thrikkakara police stations are probing into the case. “He along with his wife and daughter were staying in Thrikkakara for the past five-and-a-half years. But no relatives were aware of it. He was hiding here from others in Pune. His wife’s family came to know about their stay in Thrikkakara only six months ago. He had business in Pune and owes money to many. We have no information other than this,” said an officer of Kalamassery police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/missing-case-police-yet-to-make-headway/articleshow/81766002.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat’s ‘love jihad’ bill proposes 3-10 years jail term||GANDHINAGAR: The Gujarat government has proposed amendment in the Gujarat Freedom of Religion Act, 2003 with an aim to make it more stringent and curb forced conversion by marriages, loosely termed by the political leaders outside the assembly as law against ‘love jihad’. Ahead of the assembly session, CM Vijay Rupani had promised to bring in a strict law against ‘love jihad’. The bill, which was submitted with the state assembly secretariat on Tuesday and is likely to be tabled in the House for discussion and voting on April 1, has proposed stringent measures with minimum jail term of three years in case of conversion of an individual and four years in cases involving minor, woman or an SC/ST. The maximum jail term is of five years in case of conversion of an individual, and seven years in cases involving minor, woman or an SC/ST member.  The amendment seeks to expand the scope of "fraudulent means" in section 3 of the existing anti-conversion act by introducing conversion via marriage. This also includes abetment to such marriages either by convincing or aiding a person married. The law envisages even stringent measures to stop the religious conversion activity at an institutional level. If an organization is found involved, maximum punishment is up to 10 years and the fine imposed is Rs 5 lakh on each of the members of the organizations involved in the conversion process. Moreover, the organization will be disqualified to get any government grant. In three states – Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh – where such anti-conversion laws have been amended with a view to curbing conversion by marriages, the minimum punishment provided for is one year. The amendment also aims at punishing all those who are involved in the process of `forced conversion' including any person who aids and abets in the process. It also seeks to widen the scope of the term "influence for conversion" by adding “better lifestyle, divine blessings or otherwise" as forms of allurement. The government has proposed shifting of burden of proof to the accused, meaning thereby those who are accused of forced conversion will have to establish that the conversion was by free will. “The burden of proof as to whether a religious conversion was not effected through misrepresentation, force, undue influence, coercion, allurement or by any fraudulent means or by marriage shall lie on the person who has caused the conversion and where such conversion has been facilitated by any person by act, omission, aid, abetment or counselling, on such other person. The bill also proposes that such marriages, in which there are allegations of forced conversion, will be held void by family courts. The complaint can be filed by either the victim or the person who is sought to be converted forcibly or through allurement or by any of his/her blood relatives. The complaints for the non-bailable offence can be investigated by a police officer not below the rank of a DySP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarats-love-jihad-bill-proposes-3-10-years-jail-term/articleshow/81768512.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘DVRs destroyed as they had images of SUV movements’||MUMBAI: Arrested cop Sachin Waze’s personal driver drove the explosives-laden Scorpio and parked it near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence, NIA has said.  “Waze himself was in the Innova SUV tailing the Scorpio till the industrialist’s residence. Waze’s driver then got into the Innova and they left. Officials said the Innova was seen crossing the Mulund toll naka only to return sometime later with a different number plate and was seen near Antilia. Waze, who was then wearing a kurta pyjama, went near the Scorpio and placed the threatening letter,” an official said. The NIA is probing the planting of explosives and the subsequent murder of Hiran, whose body was found in a creek in Mumbra on March 5. Officials said they are joining the dots so that the complete picture is clear, including the motive. “This is probably the reason that the two DVRs -- one at the police headquarters and one at Saket society – were destroyed. We believe the DVRS would have contained images of the vehicle movements,” an official said. Waze has reportedly admitted to the crime ranging from stealing of the Scorpio and planting of gelatin sticks but not revealed anything on his accomplices who aided and abetted him in the crime, a source said. Officials are also probing if any of his senior officers had knowledge of the conspiracy. Meanwhile, NIA on Tuesday recovered a Mitsubishi Outlander which was found abandoned in Kalamboli two days before Waze’s arrest. This car is registered in Waze’s name. This is the sixth high- end car recovered by the NIA in the case so far, and they are still looking for an Audi and a Skoda which Waze were using. The NIA is likely to take custody of CCTV footage of Mumbai police headquarters on Wednesday. The ATS had written to the Mumbai police early this month to preserve custody of the CCTV footage of 45 days, from February onwards. The investigators want to know the set of people who came to meet Waze during this period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-dvrs-destroyed-as-they-had-images-of-suv-movements/articleshow/81768280.cms||Ahmed Ali

On Tuesday, police detained the deceased Amritlal Patel’s wife Lakshmi (71) following a complaint lodged by the victim’s nephew Kamlesh. On Monday, Lakshmi had gone to the temple and ever since she returned, her husband kept on accused her of having gone to meet some man. He allegedly kept abusing her throughout the day and even tried hitting her with a glass bottle. She dodged and managed to save herself. Kamlesh told police that his uncle and aunt used to fight frequently as the former always cast aspersions on her character. Around four times in the past, Kamlesh had to strike truce between the couple. Things came to a pass during dinner when Amritlal again started abusing her and tried to attack her. In retaliation, Lakshmi picked up the wooden washing paddle and hit him. He collapsed on the floor and suffered multiple injuries. “My uncle used to doubt my aunt and often fought with her. On Monday, during the fight she hit him on the head and he suffered injuries in the abdominal area and died,” Kamlesh told police. Amritlal had retired around 15 years ago from a leading textile mill in Mumbai. Lakshmi has studied up to graduation from Valsad. Both daughters of the couple are married and settled in the US and Dubai. Amritlal’s family is originally from Valsad town and his father was a superintendent in customs and central excise. The couple had shifted to Valsad from Mumbai 15 years ago. “The old man constantly doubted that his wife had an affair with someone. The family members had tried convincing several times in the past, but in vain,” said a police officer in Valsad town police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/78-year-old-retired-engineer-suspects-affair-71-yr-old-wife-kills-him/articleshow/81766024.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

At least 50 patients had to be evacuated. Fire officials said that no one was injured in the incident. The fire probably started because of high voltage fluctuation and a short circuit. The incident was reported to Delhi Fire Service around 6.30 am by the hospital authorities. DFS director Atul Garg said, “When our firefighters reached the spot, they found that a short circuit in a ventilator machine had led to the fire causing a lot of smoke in the ward on the first floor. This block is a three-storey building. The hospital staff reported that eight patients were inside the ICU. Our men rushed inside and all eight patients were evacuated with the help of hospital staff,” Garg said. The fire chief said, at least nine fire tenders were rushed to the spot to contain the blaze. “While firefighters were trying to contain the blaze, as many as forty of our men were roped in to carry out a massive rescue operation. With the help of the hospital staff, they shifted over 50 patients, who were in wards next to the ICU where the fire broke out, to other floors to save them from suffocating. They were attended to by doctors and are fine,” he added. Garg further said that even though it wasn’t a major fire and was controlled following an hour-long struggle, some medical equipment, airconditioners and other equipment kept in the ICU were gutted. In a statement, Safdarjung Hospital said, “There was a minor fire incident in medicine ward-11 (HDU) in the hospital at 6.15am probably due to high voltage fluctuations and short-circuit. All the patients admitted in HDU and the ward were evacuated immediately to other wards by our nursing staff and security personnel. There was no loss of life, the fire was controlled immediately by our fire safety team. Regular fire drills in the hospital with cooperation from the fire department helped in managing the situation on time.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/fire-in-safdarjung-icu-ward-50-patients-shifted/articleshow/81792366.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Lobo told TOI that the Goa Waste Management Corporation (GWMC) will also ask for a presentation. “After evaluation of the documents, financial bids will be opened,” he said. Last month, the state government finally received three bids for the setting up of the Rs 200 crore solid waste management facility at Bainguinim. The companies that have expressed interest are Hindustan Waste Treatment Pvt Ltd, Maaviya Engineering Consultants Pvt Ltd and Three R Management Pvt Ltd. Due to inadequate offers, the state government had extended the time limit for accepting bids four times, the last being on January 31. Four companies — Organic recycling system, Hindustan waste treatment, Three R management and Landsky engineers — participated in the pre-bid meeting for the plant. In 2008, the Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) had acquired land at Bainguinim to set up the plant and in 2017 it was handed over to GWMC. A public hearing was also held by GWMC and the environment clearance was also obtained. The plant is expected to cater to the entire Tiswadi taluka. The corporation had also invited a request for qualification (RFQ) for the proposed plant. GWMC has decided to undertake the project through a public-private partnership (PPP) on a design-build-finance-operate-transfer (DBFOT) basis, wherein the plant infrastructure will be implemented by the concessionaire.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bainguinim-plant-bids-put-up-before-panel-for-scrutiny/articleshow/81768273.cms||---

Just like every other community, we also have a set of demands.” Listing out their long-pending demands, he said the city corporation should allocate separate space for them to set up a market. “Identity cards should be issued to all the vendors and priority should be given to us while setting up food carts and eateries along the lake as part of lake rejuvenation project.” He said a separate welfare board should also be established for the street vendors. There are close to 40,000 street vendors in the city alone.

---||Mumbai||BMC had ignored red flag, didn’t review Sunrise’s provisional OC in Mumbai||MUMBAI: The BMC’s building proposal department had raised a red flag last August and said that the grant of provisional Occupation Certificate (OC) to Bhandup’s Sunrise Hospital must be reviewed and it wasn’t proper to de-link the irregularities of Dreams Mall from the hospital. However, despite a detailed report from the department, the BMC did not review or revoke the provisional OC.Early on Friday, a major fire broke out in the mall and spread to Sunrise Hospital located on the third floor. Over 70 patients were rescued and 11 bodies found. The fire was extinguished on Saturday—after 40 hours. TimesViewThe BMC’s own building proposal department had raised a red flag in August last year stating that the provisional OC granted to Sunrise Hospital be reviewed, but no action was taken even after more than six months. Had the BMC taken timely action on the department’s report and revoked the provisional OC or ensured compliance of norms, the fire incident could have been avoided. The BMC probe must investigate if there were any lapses and strict action must be taken against those responsible.In August 2020, deputy chief engineer of building proposal department (eastern suburbs) N R Khanolkar had submitted a detailed report stating that Privilege Healthcare Services, which owned the hospital, had not complied with conditions mentioned in the provisional OC approved by then BMC chief Praveen Pardeshi four months ago. The report also stated that the firm had neither replied to BMC nor submitted the mandatory documents for OC—the hospital was asked to submit them within one month of easing of lockdown restrictions. The BMC had delinked unauthorised construction in shops on the first and second floors of the mall and even FSI violation and unauthorised work carried out in the hospital on the third floor since it was not aware that Dr Nikita Trehan, director of Privilege Healthcare Services, was a shareholder in HDIL, the company that built Dreams Mall. “It was reflected from the presentation of Dr Trehan that the hospital premises had been purchased by Privilege Healthcare Services in 2021, and as such was considered as a third-party with reference to HDIL...it was mentioned that compliance of conditions related to premises other than hospital will not be in control of Dr Trehan. However, it is now reflected from...HDIL website that Dr Trehan is a shareholder of HDIL and the daughter of Rakesh Wadhawan,” Khanolkar’s report said. The report submitted to BMC chief Iqbal Chahal in August 2020 recommended that the decision to grant provisional OC to Sunrise be reviewed. “After revelation of Dr Trehan’s relation with HDIL, it is felt that it would not be proper to delink the critical issues involved in the mall while granting OC to only the remaining portion... it is felt that there is a need to review the decision of granting provisional OC to the hospital premises...and sorting of all issues involved in granting of regular OC... ,” the report added. BMC officials said after Khanolkar’s report, the hospital had made a fresh representation seeking a regular OC. Chahal said he had asked the department to strictly go by the law and process the representation and take necessary action.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bmc-had-ignored-red-flag-didnt-review-sunrises-provisional-oc-in-mumbai/articleshow/81768354.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Rape accused turns out to be honey trap target||AHMEDABAD: It all started with a ‘wrong number’. When Mansukh Patel answered the call of a young woman seeking to talk to a Jagdishbhai for a job, little did he know that a week later, cops would come ing knocking on his door regarding a rape complaint. However, investigation has now cleared the 61-year-old is not a rape accused. In fact, the Bapunagar resident turned out to be the victim of a honey trap. The cops arrested a 20-year-old woman and two others in this regard on Tuesday. The woman had filed a complaint against Patel on March 25, alleging that Patel had called her to Madhuvan hotel in the area and raped her on the pretext of getting her a job.  The police arrested Patel. While investigating the matter, they found evidence that the girl had been lying. Meanwhile, Patel in his statement revealed another story for which he furnished evidence. It stated, “Patel said that when he heard that the girl who had identified herself as Asha was in dire straits, he offered to get her a job at GIDC, which she turned down. He claimed that he took the girl to the office of an LIC agent, but the girl refused that job too. Instead, on March 21, the girl took Rs 100 from him claiming she did not have money.” Police said, “That evening, Asha told Patel to come to Falediwas in Saipur. She took him to a temple near Vastral station and narrated a sob story of how her family was suffering from financial hardships. Patel offered to get her married to some youth from the same community, but she did not agree. She said that she wanted to stay with him. She claimed that it was her birthday on March 23 and asked Patel to accompany her to a hotel. She even offered to arrange for ID proofs.” The next day on March 22, the girl allegedly called him and took him to Madhuvan hotel. “Patel withdrew Rs 3,000 from the ATM to pay for the hotel charge. They did not indulge in any relationship as Asha claimed to have chest pain. However, Vikas and two women caught Patel and abused him. Vikas asked for Rs 13 lakh to let him go. Then, Rajesh Wadher, who claimed to know Patel, mediated and the matter was settled for Rs 7 lakh,” said police. They reportedly let off Patel to arrange for the money. However, on March 25, when the police knocked on Patel’s door, he got to know that the girl had lodged a complaint of rape against him. Bapunagar Inspector A P Gadhvi said, “While investigating the rape complaint, we found evidence that Patel had been the target of a honey trap gang. We have arrested Vikas Gohil, Rajesh Wadher, and the young woman. Two other women who have been named as co-accused are absconding.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/rape-accused-turns-out-to-be-honey-trap-target/articleshow/81768349.cms||---

---||Pune||Maharashtra: Can prevent lockdown if we stick to precautions, says expert||PUNE: Advisor to the state government on Covid-19 control, Dr Subhash Salunke, said on Tuesday that a pan-Maharashtra lockdown can be avoided if people keep up Covid-appropriate behavior, particularly in high-incidence cities and districts. “A statewide lockdown is now out of the question. Strict local containment measures along with stringent action against those breaking Covid norms are better alternatives,” Dr Salunke said, adding that experts are set to suggest a six-point plan to authorities soon. The plan, he said, will include suggestions such as expansion of the vaccination drive and better access to health facilities. “All these suggestions are to avoid a total lockdown,” Dr Salunke said. He said the six-point plan will be presented at an upcoming meeting with deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar for Pune district. “A similar recommendation will be made to the chief minister. We will strongly recommend finding alternatives to an absolute lockdown,” Dr Salunke said. Aseem Gupta, secretary, state Relief and Rehabilitation department said, “Discussions are on to explore stricter measures in Maharashtra. But a 100% lockdown is not in the offing. In fact, nobody is advocating a full lockdown, including the Centre. For the foreseeable future, the aim is stricter restrictions and their fool-proof implementation.” Dr Shashank Joshi, member of the state Covid-19 task force, said the expert group had never suggested a lockdown to the government. He said, “We want healthcare facilities to be scaled up to accommodate larger numbers. We have also called for tightening of the home-quarantine policy; institutional quarantine for asymptomatic cases; and better contact tracing. A lockdown will not be needed once these steps are taken.” Many experts have said that lockdowns have few public health benefits. In an email interview with TOI, Dr David Livermore, a prominent infectious disease expert from the University of East Anglia, England, said the massive economic and social costs of the lockdowns are now clear. “But their effectiveness in controlling Covid-19 isn’t clear at all, except if, as in New Zealand, they are applied very early in a country that isolates itself. Internationally, the correlation between lockdown stringency and deaths due to Covid is very poor. Many countries with strict lockdowns have had high death tolls.” Dr Livermore added, “Other factors, particularly age of the population are more vital. And, while sero studies show India had a huge Covid outbreak last year, the death rate was not high. More than twice as many people died of TB than of Covid. Perhaps the limited death rate was due to a young population; perhaps it’s due to good natural immunity from exposure to other coronaviruses. We don’t know, but it is a good guide not to panic this time around, as rates rise.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/can-prevent-lockdown-if-we-stick-to-precautions-expert/articleshow/81767138.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Delhi||Rape case can’t be quashed even after ‘pact’: Delhi high court||NEW DELHI: Delhi high court has refused to quash criminal proceedings against three men booked under POCSO Act for sexually harassing a minor girl. Though the minor, now an adult, and her family reached a compromise with the accused men, who are distantly related to her, the court made it clear “there can be no letup in prosecuting a heinous crime.” “It is well-settled that the power under section 482 CrPC is to be distinguished from the one that lies with the court to compound the offences compoundable under CrPC Section 320. No doubt, under Section 482, the high court has the power to quash even in those offences that are not compoundable, where the parties have settled the matter between themselves, but the power must be exercised fairly and with caution. Rape is a heinous crime punishable under Section 376 IPC,” justice Subramonium Prasad noted, declining any relief to the accused. The court was hearing a plea by Dinesh and others, which said that a compromise had been entered into between the girl, her mother and the petitioners. The plea urged the court to intervene and quash the FIR. Instead, the court noted that any move to quash an offence under POCSO Act would go against the intention of the legislature, which had brought out special enactment to protect the interest of children. “The FIR cannot be quashed on the ground that the victim, after attaining majority, has decided to compromise the matter with the accused,” it noted, and cited the Supreme Court, which has categorically said that heinous crime like rape could not be quashed by the high court by exercising power under Section 482 CrPC even if the parties had reached a compromise. According to police, the survivor’s mother had lodged an FIR in 2018 for offences punishable under IPC sections 354, 354D, 506, 509, 34 IPC and Section 10 of POCSO Act. She informed police that Dinesh had come to stay with the family while he was looking for a job and had tried to molest the girl. When she raised the alarm, he apologised. Later, in 2017 when the family went to Punjab to attend a wedding, Dinesh and his two nephews harassed her. They even tried to drag her into a room and threatened her to cooperate else her nude photographs would be made public, the complaint said. When she again informed her parents about the harassment, her mother rebuked the accused and decided to approach police. A case was then registered at the Shakarpur police station.

The BJP has fielded Mahesh Jeena, brother of Surendra Singh Jeena who won the seat in 2017 and died last year due to Covid-19, whereas the Congress has nominated Ganga Pancholi, who had lost the elections to Surendra Singh Jeena by 3,000 votes in 2017. The opposition party, on the other hand, is hoping to cash in on the resentment brewing in the region against the government over its decision to include Almora under the newly announced Gairsain division. The locals have been staging protests who claimed that by placing Almora under Gairsain division, “the government has stripped off their Kuamon identity.” The Congress on Tuesday released a list of 30 star campaigners, comprising party president Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, former PM Manmohan Singh, state in-charge Devender Yadav, former CM Harish Rawat and other prominent state leaders. Congress vice president Suryakant Dhasmana told TOI, “We will definitely register a win at the Salt seat. With the CM deciding not to contest from here, it sends out a clear indication that things are not in favour of the ruling party.” Dhasmana pointed out that by replacing Trivendra Singh Rawat, the BJP has admitted its “failure and mistake.” He added, “There is a lack of development in the state and people are well aware of the facts.” Meanwhile, BJP said that Rawat had recently taken the charge and added that it was the top leadership that decided not to field the CM from the Salt seat. “The decision was taken by the national leadership and we followed it. As for Congress, it has been reduced to 11 MLAs in state assembly and lost all five Lok Sabha seats in 2014 and 2019. Since there are no important issues to be raised, they have come up with such baseless allegations. The BJP will comfortably win the seat,” BJP vice-president Devendra Bhasin said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/salt-bypoll-a-litmus-test-for-cm-while-cong-banks-on-gairsain-row-for-comeback/articleshow/81766077.cms||Kautilya Singh

Three children of the two families were rescued from the debris and rushed to the hospital where two kids — aged 10 and 12 — were declared brought dead while a 10-year-old boy is struggling for life. The incident took place in Momin Nagar area in Shamli district on Sunday night. According to sources, several kids aged 8-12 were playing on the roof of the mosque, which was under construction. Many of them had a narrow escape while three kids sustained severe injuries. Harun (10) and Musarib (12) were declared brought dead while Sameer (10) was referred to a higher facility in Meerut. After the incident, police visited the spot. According to sub-divisional magistrate Sandeep Kumar, “No written complaint was filed by families.” Matloob Ahmed, father of Musarib, said, “He had gone to offer namaz.

---||Nagpur||Over 3,000 Nagpur University students on the verge of losing a year||NAGPUR: While announcing the re-exam for over 10,000 students who faced hurdles while appearing for the winter 2020 exams on the first day, Nagpur University did not take any decision regarding the other examinees, who faced similar issues in the next four days. According to the figures provided by NU, nearly 3,491 students couldn’t submit their papers despite logging in due to low internet connectivity, power failure, and other issues. Hundreds of students also complained that their paper ended before time and hence, they couldn’t solve all the questions. Many used social media to air their grievances. They also tagged TOI, saying they faced issues due to slow servers and connectivity, but their papers indicated successful submission. Board of Examination and Evaluation (BOEE) director Prafulla Sable has advised students missing out on the exams to contact their college principal and send their application to the NU exam section. “We will compile their information and verify it with our server data. We have every minute data of all the students who logged in. We will make a list of genuine cases and put it before the BOEE and NU top brass. However, any decision would be implemented after the exams are over,” said Sable. As examinees from rural areas faced genuine problems due to poor connectivity and devices, NU would consider their cases, added Sable. On Monday, hundreds of engineering students faced similar issues while solving their papers. While many couldn’t log in, others faced connectivity issues for which they blamed the NU server. Few students complained that their papers were submitted prematurely. Refuting allegations, the director said only engineering students faced issues while the others, who appeared for general courses, hardly complained. “It’s impossible that they didn’t get time to solve the questions. The server didn’t discriminate between students. These students are technologically advanced. They tried to experiment with the system and hence, didn’t get enough time. Many take screenshots which the server records as suspicious activity and blocks them. In the last paper, we had extended the time but today, no such facility was provided,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/over-3000-nu-students-on-the-verge-of-losing-a-year/articleshow/81781277.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The yarn price has increased to Rs 62 per kilogram since September and is expected to rise by another Rs 10 in a few months. Pointing out that the textiles industry was labour-intensive and more than 25 lakh families in the state were dependent on it for their livelihood, the letter said the unsustainable price rise of cotton yarn has sabotaged the whole industry and affected the livelihood of thousands of workers. Explaining that the businessmen, especially exporters, finalize orders based on the existing yarn price, he said they were forced to cut down on production because of the constant increase in price of the raw materials. “Their future has become uncertain.” While seeking the intervention both the state and central governments to arrest the price rise on a priority basis, the MP also demanded them to take steps to ensure minimum support price to the cotton growers, procure cotton and ensure its availability to the yarn makers through the Cotton Corporation of India at a reasonable price. “Before exporting it, cotton yarn should be made available to the domestic textile players. Steps should be taken to keep the yarn price stable at least for a fixed period and the price should be fixed by the government,” he said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/control-yarn-price-rise-mp-tells-govt/articleshow/81768359.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

At present, both government and private hospitals have 16,225 beds. Many private hospitals, which had closed Covid-19 wards are now reopening them as the number of cases rise. Officials at the state-run Gandhi Hospital also said that they would increase the bed strength if needed. Those who need vigorous treatment are now being referred to Gandhi and TIMS hospitals. In view of rising number of cases, Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) officials have gone into ‘alert mode’ and announced hotspots in Serilingamaplli, Himyatnagar, Kukatpalli, Chintal Basti, Charminar, Golconda, Aghapura, LB Nagar, Charminar, Qutubullapur, Jeedimetal, Chandrayangutta, Malkpet and Santoshnagar. Officials said containment zones would also be strictly enforced. In the city, 10 more staffers at the GHMC head office tested Covid positive, making others wary to come to work. Several staff members at the National Informatics Centre (NIC) in BRK Bhavan also tested positive. Suspecting that a few employees, who tested positive, were attending duties, some staffers also approached higher authorities to allow them to work from home. Most of the tested patients were reportedly outsourcing and contract staff. Meanwhile, with 70 cases, officials at the Yadadri temple have decided to temporarily close the arjita sevas. Many priests and staff tested positive at the temple in last few days. The sevas will be closed from April 1 to April 3. Distribution of Anna Prasadam will also be temporarily stopped.

If there’s a lockdown, there may be restrictions on travel. We had seen it last year. I rescheduled our appointments and all of us got vaccinated just a day before,” said Joshi, a senior officer working with a multinational company in Hinjewadi. Joshi’s instance is not an isolated one. Apprehensions about another round of lockdown have sparked a scramble among citizens for the vaccine shield against Covid-19. Joshi has urged government officials to think twice before announcing a lockdown again. “Lockdown is not a solution to stop the spread of the virus. We can control the virus only with the vaccination,’ he said. Health officials said vaccination would not be stalled even if a lockdown was announced or stringent restrictions were reinforced. The officials said citizens should not go overboard. City’s immunization officer, Vaishali Jadhav, did not dismiss the people’s rush for vaccination fearing return of the lockdown. “The next two to three days will decide whether there is really a rush owing to such apprehensions. If the daily vaccination counts in the Pune Municipal Corporation limits exceed the current average count of 12,000 per day, then we can fairly say that a rush or a scramble is underway,” Jadhav said. “People also need to understand that the vaccination will continue uninterrupted even if the lockdown is announced. Inoculation comes under essential services and people should not panic. Every eligible person will get the vaccine,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/anxiety-over-closure-sets-off-rush-to-get-shots-early/articleshow/81767169.cms||Mihir Tanksale

According to police, the deceased have been identified as Mayank Yadav, son of a former village head -mlesh Kumar Yadav, and a native of Nagla Nariya village in Jaswantnagar and Mukesh, their servant, from neighbouring Firozabad district. Police said it appeared that Mukesh, who as per former village head’s family members, was a little feeble minded, had first hacked his employer’s son to death and later ended his life by hanging himself. Police said that the two on Sunday night had their dinner and later went to sleep in one of the rooms of the house. However, when they did not come out of the room early Monday morning, the family members visited the room and found Mayank with grievous wounds lying in a pool of blood, while the servant Mukesh’s body was found hanging from the ceiling. They then informed the police. Their bodies were sent to district hospital for postmortem examination. SSP Etawah Brijesh Kumar Singh said, “It look as if Mayank was murdered by his servant Mukesh, who too later committed suicide by hanging himself. The latter as per Mayank’s family was of feeble mind. One of the former village head’s relatives, who also belongs to Firozabad, had brought Mukesh to their place. We have apprised Mukesh’s family members about the incident. However, we are working on all possible angles to ascertain their exact cause of death and are awaiting an autopsy report.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/youth-servant-found-dead-in-etawah/articleshow/81768390.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Fewer Indian family businesses laid off staff to beat Covid-19 blues than global peers||HYDERABAD: Indian family businesses were more cautious when it came to resorting to layoffs to cut their Covid-19 losses as compared to their global peers, a report by STEP Project Global Consortium and KPMG Private Enterprise has revealed. According to the report, nearly 29% of family-run companies in India took action to reduce labour costs as compared to the global average of 36%. The report, ‘Mastering a comeback: How family businesses are triumphing over Covid-19?’, includes insights from over 2,500 family businesses and over 500 non-family businesses across 75 countries. In India, the survey was conducted by the Thomas Schmidheiny Centre for Family Enterprise at the Indian School of Business (ISB). Commenting on the findings of the survey, Nupur Pavan Bang, associate director, Thomas Schmidheiny Centre for Family Enterprise, ISB, said, “Emphasis on cost reduction through cutting operating costs, cutting down on investments, restructuring, deferring payments and expenses, and reducing the top management team’s compensation was more in India as compared to family firms globally.” As per the study, family businesses globally were 42% more likely to deploy a business transformation strategy than non-family firms. Many also took time to streamline their operations, including accelerating the implementation of new digital solutions, and focusing on succession planning and ownership structures, the study said. Meanwhile, family businesses with multiple generations involved in their operations were 45% more likely to implement a business transformation strategy when compared to single-generation family firms. Due to their conservative approach, the initial strategy adopted by family businesses globally was to exercise patience and see how the impact of the pandemic would evolve over a period of time. However, the second-most important strategy for this group was to begin transforming their businesses after they had taken sufficient time to assess the situation and their options, the study said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/fewer-indian-family-businesses-laid-off-staff-to-beat-covid-19-blues-than-global-peers/articleshow/81767170.cms||Swati Rathor

And, 18.6 kg grains and Rs 923 have been set aside for each student of upper primary school. While primary school students will get the funds for 138 days – from September 1, 2020, to February 28, 2021, upper primary school students will get the funds for 124 days – from September 1, 2020, to February 9, 2021,” read the order issued by Dr Kajal, UP special secretary. This comes in the backdrop of the decision taken by the government to provide the families of nearly 1.8 crore students studying in government-run schools the conversion cost and food grains for the period when schools remained due to Covid-19 outbreak. The order further stated that the money should be transferred only after block education officers provide details of each student from the Prerna portal to each school principal, who will further verify the details before transferring the money. “The government had already transferred the funds and grains for the period from March 2020 to August 2020 in two phases. Instructions have also been given to ensure that these funds are utilised judiciously and not rerouted for other activities or schemes,” said Dr Kajal.

---||Pune||Citizens apprehend shutdown may slow down vaccination progress in Pune||PUNE: Citizens are worried that any further lockdown might affect the Covid-19 vaccination progress in the city. Some citizens are anxious about finding transport to the vaccination centres, while others express fears about the “high-handedness of the enforcing authorities if a lockdown is announced”. Experts said such apprehensions were likely to affect the vaccination numbers if the lockdown measures came into force and would undermine the huge efforts that have gone into boosting the inoculation numbers over the past three months. The experts were unanimous that besides adhering to the Covid-19 protocol, vaccinating a large chunk of the population would arrest the spread of the virus. “A lockdown in all likelihood will reduce the vaccination numbers. Factors such as the psychological stress a lockdown ushers-in, the valuable energy getting drained in ensuring essential commodities needed for daily living, fear of police high-handedness and the restrictions on transport services will collectively take a toll on the vaccination numbers if such a restriction is announced,” said vaccine researcher Sharad Agarkhedkar. Agarkhedkar is also a senior paediatrician and former president of the Indian Medical Association’s Pune chapter. Sharing the view, Bomi Bhote, chief executive officer of Ruby Hall Clinic, said, “Vaccination numbers will certainly go down if there’s a lockdown. Lockdown has become synonymous with hardships, transport woes and all sorts of unforeseen difficulties.” Citizens forums also have highlighted that commuting to the vaccination centres would not be an easy task during lockdown as there would be restrictions on plying of vehicles. The absence of public transport vehicles, such as autorickshaws and buses, would make it more difficult for people to reach the centres, the forums felt.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/citizens-apprehend-shutdown-may-slow-down-vaccination-progress/articleshow/81767168.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Pune||Leaders across party lines unite to oppose curbs||Pune: All corporators of Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) cutting across party lines have united to oppose a possible lockdown. A lockdown would potentially not just adversely affect the city’s economy, but also cause obstacles in development work, the corporators said. Non-availability of labourers could hamper key projects like 24x7 water supply and construction of flyovers. Even pre-monsoon works would get delayed due to restrictions imposed during the lockdown, they added. “Experts and scientists have expressed views about the Covid-19 spread. They observed a lockdown will not be the right solution at this point,” said Mayor Murlidhar Mohol.  “A lockdown is not the need of the hour. This is not going to help break the chain. It will create more problems than solution. More stringent rules can be imposed, but a lockdown must not happen” said Deepali Dhumal of NCP and leader of opposition in the Pune Municipal Corporation According to PMC leaders, civic works are starting to come back on track in the last couple of months. “Many daily wage workers are going to lose income if there is a lockdown. This will lead to many socio-economic problems. The situation is so serious that people from the lower income groups will be left with no option but to beg,” said Congress leader Aba Bagul. Shiv Sena leader in PMC Prithviraj Sutar said a collective effort is needed to deal with the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/leaders-across-party-lines-unite-to-oppose-curbs/articleshow/81767175.cms||---

Hyderabad police commissioner Anjani Kumar said that keeping in view the possible second wave of Covid-19 in the city, people must wear masks and avoid mass gatherings. A day before, Kumar had said that all officers at the police station levels had been told to create awareness about in local communities. “Our objective is to make people wear mask and not levy heavy penalties,” Kumar had said. On Tuesday, Rachakonda police commissioner Mahesh Bhagwat has warned that those who do not wear masks will be prosecuted and Rs 1,000 fine will be imposed. LB Nagar traffic inspector Nagamallu conducted a programme at Kottapeta Chowrasta with performers wearing masks to create awareness among people about the second wave of Covid-19 in the city. The consequences of not taking precautions were presented in the form of a street play by a cultural group so as to make it relatable to motorists.

---||Nagpur||Centre fails to release Rs 800cr scholarship dues: Pvt colleges||Nagpur: Even as the current fiscal (2020-21) ends on Wednesday, the central government has failed to release its share of scholarship amount of Rs 800 crore for the backward category candidates. As per managements of private colleges, ones offering professional courses like engineering, pharmacy and law were the worst sufferers, as they haven’t been able to pay salaries of their staff since many months. The state government has released its share of Rs 380 crore. State relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar failed to respond to TOI’s calls and text messages in this regard. The college managements’ office-bearers had even threatened to discontinue admissions of students if the Centre failed to release their dues. They said ideally, the scholarship amount should be released in advance but the centre had failed to complete formalities even as the academic year was coming to an end. Besides salaries, some colleges also claimed to have mounting bills of electricity, water and maintenance. The office-bearers claimed that BJP-led NDA government had allocated a big amount of Rs 59,000 crore for scholarships of backward communities for next five years, a couple of months back. However, it failed to release even a single rupee for this financial year which puts colleges on the verge of closure. The Centre and states pay tuition and exam fees of the backward category students to their respective colleges, but this year, the former had inordinately delayed its amount for the first time, the colleges said. The Centre and state made their norms stricter for releasing scholarships after TOI exposed multi-crore scholarship scam on August 10, 2014, where colleges allegedly siphoned off the money by showing fake enrolments and forging documents. A Special Investigation Team (SIT) under additional director general of special operations K Venkatesham confirmed the scam after inspecting audit reports of just 15% of state’s colleges which was about 1,704. On this basis, it arrived at the misappropriation figure of Rs2,174 crore in the scholarship distribution in these colleges. However, nothing has progressed since then, even after assurances. # Scholarship dues released by Centre & state: Year -----------Centre ------------ State 2016-17 ------- 880 -------------- 137 2017-18 ------- 505-------------- 379 2018-19 ------- 572 -------------- 461 2019-20 ------- 559 -------------- 494 2020-21 ------- 00 -------------- 380 (All amounts in Rs crore)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/centre-fails-to-release-rs-800cr-scholarship-dues-pvt-colleges/articleshow/81767172.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The MCCIA also cited its own, post-lockdown economic surveys to demonstrate the effects last year’s lockdown had on the manufacturing sector in the industrial belt in and around Pune, especially on MSMEs, many of which serve as ancillaries to larger industries. Only in the last few months, according to the surveys, have a majority of the firms achieved close to pre-Covid levels of productivity and employment. “We say a definite no to the lockdown. Our monthly surveys of economic recovery at MCCIA shows that it impacts smaller and informal firms more. This is increasing unemployment. Just with the fear of a lockdown, migrant workers are feeling unsettled. If some start migrating back, then manufacturing assembly lines get disrupted,” said Prashant Girbane, the MCCIA director-general.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/industry-leaders-urge-pm-cm-to-avoid-drastic-steps/articleshow/81767171.cms||---

CPM’s Minakshi Mukherjee, a 37-year-old postgraduate and a party whole-timer, is leading a spirited campaign in Nandigram for the Left. Sixty-two-year-old Subrata Bose has chosen to contest from Nandigram “to be part of the high-profile contest”. The Haridevpur resident said, “Would you have called me had I not contested from Nandigram? This is why I chose this seat in the first place.” A Calcutta University commerce graduate, who has retired and now works as a consultant, said he was always interested in politics. “I went to Nandigram even today,” he said, refusing to elaborate more. Dipak Kumar Gayen (44), who works as a laboratory assistant at a school, has joined the Nandigram fray for “personal reasons”. “My wife is not well. When I was assigned poll duty, I pleaded to be exempted from the work, but to no avail. So, I decided to contest the polls to protest against genuine reasons being ignored. There was another personal issue, which I can’t divulge, but that has been addressed,” said Gayen, a Nandigram local. Though he is known as a local Trinamool leader, he declined to comment on it. Swapan Parua, a Nandigram farmer, refused to explain his reason for contest. “I am not in a position to discuss things,” he said. Parua cited “poor connectivity” in Nandigram for his inability to speak over the phone. Sk Saddam Hussain (28) had told reporters he had stepped into poll fray to avenge humiliation meted out to his father, former CPI Nandigram MLA Md Illias During the height of the Nandigram movement, Illias was forced to quit after he was indicted in a sting operation. Saddam had told reporters he had decided to fight after the Left decided to field a CPM candidate, not CPI, for Nandigram. But Hussain could not be reached over phone. CPM’s Mukherjee, a Kulti resident, a postgraduate with an additional graduation degree in education, has been criss-crossing Nandigram villages on motorcycles, in totos and even on foot. Dubbing the Nandigram battle to be “one against giants” she told reporters, “If people can vote without fear, we are very confident. But the EC must ensure that central forces should do beyond marching with heavy boots on metallic roads. They need to step out in villages and ensure people can go to cast their votes and return safely.” SUCI (Communist) Manoj Kumar Das, the eighth candidate in the Nandigram fray, said “People in Nandigram are battle hardened. They will speak their mind. They should be allowed to speak through EVMs.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/west-bengal/davids-line-up-against-goliaths-in-pole-contest/articleshow/81771223.cms||Suman Mandal
---||Coimbatore||City NGOs submit memorandum of demands to Kamal||Coimbatore: A group of city-based NGOs, involved in environment and water conservation, submitted a memorandum of demands to actor and Makkal Needhi Maiam founder Kamal Haasan on Tuesday. The memorandum focused on the need to increase water storage capacity in water tanks to serve a growing population, need to improve saving and harvesting of rainwater and improving infrastructure including expansion of the airport and creating the circular road route connecting the district’s suburbs. Haasan said most of their demands were already on his radar and would do his best to implement them. On Tuesday, NGOs including Kovai Neerkarangal Kootamaipu, the Residents Awareness Associations of Coimbatore and Siruthuli met Haasan and submitted the 23-point memorandum at the Siruthuli office. “Our demands focused on improving rainwater storage capacity like ensuring water percolation by building more check dams and stop rainwater run-off because of inadequate storm water drains,” said Vanitha Mohan, managing trustee of Siruthuli. The other demands include reviving the Noyyal River and restoring Chinna Vedampatti Lake. NGOs including Kongu Global Forum also asked him to take steps to expand airport and complete the outer ring and inner ring road projects for Coimbatore. The work for western bypass is too slow while the work for eastern bypass are yet to take off. “We also asked for more mofussil trains connecting Mettupalayam, Tirupur, Palghat and Pollachi and a new master plan for the district that is pending for the past 25 years,” said Mohan. The actor said the demands were essential ones that needed to be looked into. He said he would do his best to implement the above and praised the members of NGOs for already functioning in an organized manner to support the government in the above.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/city-ngos-submit-memorandum-of-demands-to-kamal/articleshow/81768391.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Chandigarh||BJP state chief meets senior leaders, chalks out strategy||Times News Network Ludhiana: In the wake of the attack on Abohar MLA Arun Narang, BJP state president Ashwani Sharma presided over a meeting of senior leaders in Ludhiana on Tuesday. Although details of the discussions held in this meeting are unknown, sources inside the party said senior leaders did some brainstorming on the strategy to be followed in the state. After the meeting, Sharma spoke to mediapersons and said, “During Congress’s rule in Punjab, law and order machinery has totally collapsed. Gangsters and criminals are having a free run and so many killings, rapes and other crimes against women are taking place in broad daylight. The deadly attack on our elected MLA in Malout could not have taken place without the consent of the ruling government. What was the fault of our MLA, who exercising his democratic right, had gone there to make people aware of the misdeeds of the Amarinder government? We are fully confident that the enquiry called by Congress government in this case is an eyewash and no action will be taken against the culprits who are behind this incident. If government has still not punished those responsible for attacking me months back, how can we expect any action in the latest case?” He said the government has lost the mandate to govern Punjab and the CM should immediately resign from his post. He added, “We have already requested Punjab governor to dismiss this government at the earliest so that the law of the land prevails in Punjab again.” According to BJP state general secretary Jeewan Gupta, “Amarinder Singh, in his election manifesto, had claimed that loans of farmers would be waived off, there would be a job in every household of Punjab and in four weeks, drugs menace would be uprooted from the state. Besides these, he made dozens of other promises but not a single one was fulfilled even after four years. What is even more tragic is that several scams have also taken place in the state but the CM is not uttering a single word and is hiding his face. In another setback, the debt of the state has risen from Rs 1,82,526 crore to Rs 2,73,730 crore due to failure of the current government. As far as public is concerned, everyone is leading a life of fear in Punjab and people are totally fed up of the Congress government. It is a matter of a few months now and Congress will be routed out.” Other prominent leaders present in the meeting included co-incharge of Punjab Dr Narinder Singh, National spokesman Iqbal Singh Lalpura, Avinash Rai Khanna, Madan Mohan Mittal, Manoranjan Kalia, Teekshan Sood, K D Bhandari, Rajinder Bhandari, Anil Joshi, Kamal Chatly, Parminder Sharma and Sukhminderpal Singh Grewal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/bjp-state-chief-meets-senior-leaders-chalks-out-strategy/articleshow/81765224.cms||---

NMC standing committee, headed by Prakash Bhoyar, gave the nod to cancel agreement of 79 retailers and in principle approval to two options to change the interior of the indoor fish market complex. The NMC may seek funds from the state government and may also take the help of wholesale fish market associations to renovate the market. In 2010, as part of its plan to develop hygienic fish market, NMC had approved an air-cooled fish market at Mangalwari vegetable market. The market was built by the National Fisheries Development Board (NFDB) and Maharashtra Fisheries Development Corporation (MFDC) in 2014 at a cost of Rs3 crore. Of the Rs3 crore, NMC spent 10% while the board invested 90%. The indoor market comprises four platforms for wholesale and 108 for retail sale of fish besides having an auction gallery, and two cold storages for fish. Since the beginning, no retail fish vendor showed interest in taking up shops there citing huge deposit and rent. After NMC relaxed the deposit norms, 79 fish vendors entered into an agreement with NMC to set up shops inside the complex. But they never did their business from inside the complex. Even after so many years, those who entered into an agreement with NMC set up shops in parking area outside the market complex, saying the size of platforms inside was very small. Deputy municipal commissioner Milind Meshram said in place of platforms NMC will create facilities to accommodate 24 wholesaler fish vendors from Bhoipura. Speaking to TOI, Meshram said guardian minister Nitin Raut has assured to provide financial assistance for the project from the state government. Besides, the wholesalers association too has agreed to invest money, he said. The panel also gave its nod to spend Rs1.09 crore for pesticides and tablets to control vector borne diseases in corporation limits. It also gave green signal to hotmix department’s proposal to make provision of Rs1.91 crore for purchasing raw material for roads in the city from shortlisted bidder M/s Altaf Ahmed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/unused-for-7-years-nmc-to-revamp-mangalwari-indoor-fish-market/articleshow/81768418.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

---||Delhi||No funds, DUTA plans protests||New Delhi: Delhi University Teachers’ Association has decided to protest against Delhi government regarding unreleased funds and the Pattern of Assistance governing official funding. It will begin with a campaign against chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in his assembly constituency on April 5 and against deputy CM Manish Sisodia in his constituency on April 9. DUTA is unhappy that Kejriwal had not kept his promise of releasing Rs 28.2 crore to the 12 colleges fully funded by the state government. “We will go to the assembly constituencies and tell the people about the financial problems faced by DU teachers,” said DUTA president Rajib Ray. On March 16, the CM had met the principals of the 12 colleges and assured that Delhi government would release the funds and also invite DU acting vice-chancellor PC Joshi for a dialogue on college issues. Initially elated, the principals are now deflated. “The funds have not come. Many colleges were relying on the grant to pay the salaries of their teaching and non-teaching staff,” said Deen Dayal Upadhyaya College principal Hem Chand Jain. “Many college employees are unable to pay their taxes as the financial year ends.” Sujit Kumar, associate professor at BR Ambedkar College, maintained they had been forced to call for a protest because the government “promised to release funds, but these haven’t reached the institutions”. A government source told TOI that the grants file “is under process and the funds will be released soon”. Meanwhile, a government spokesperson claimed, “The Pattern of Assistance has been implemented ever since Delhi government began funding these 12 colleges. It is surprising why this protest is being organised now.” Claiming that the special audits carried out by the government had unearthed “serious financial irregularities” in the 12 colleges, the spokesperson said, “Clearly, vested interests in DU want to hide the irregularities from Delhi government’s efforts on financial transparency.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-funds-duta-plans-protests/articleshow/81792653.cms||Mohammad Ibrar

The commandos, who had neutralized five Maoists, including Hichami and Neitam, would have triggered more casualties. State home minister Anil Deshmukh lauded the efforts of the C-60 commandos. Sources said the Maoists were caught unawares when the C-60 commandos ventured into their safe haven. The police also claimed that the Maoists managed to flee with two more bodies from the site.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Waze & constable were at meet where Hiran murder plotted’||MUMBAI: The NIA told the special court on Tuesday that suspended API Sachin Waze and Vinayak Shinde, a constable convicted for the fake encounter of Chhota Rajan associate Ram Lakhan Bhaiya in 2007, were present at a conspiracy meeting to eliminate Mansukh Hiran.  “We have also recorded the statement of a witness who had handed over a phone to Waze. This phone was used to contact the conspirators who killed Mansukh Hiran. He was part of this conspiracy,” special public prosecutor Sunil Gonsalves submitted. Following NIA‘s submissions, special judge Prashant R Sitre sent Shinde (51) and co-accused, Naresh Gaur (31), a bookie, to NIA custody till April 7. “Prime facie involvement of the applicant is established. Sufficient opportunity must be provided to the investigating officer to dig out the truth. Investigation is at a crucial stage. Considering the nature of the offence it appears that the accused persons are also involved in the offence,” the judge said. NIA has invoked sections under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). The ATS, the earlier agency to investigate the case, had arrested the duo on March 20. Their custody was transferred to NIA on March 24. Last week, Waze was remanded to NIA custody till April 7. Seeking Shinde and Gaur’s 10-day remand, special public prosecutor Sunil Gonsalves submitted that through a disclosure statement given by Gaur, NIA found a note on March 27 with 14 phone numbers listed on it, of which five were handed over to Waze. Gonsalves said “Ok” was written next to it. The prosecution further said 5-7 SIM cards used by Waze were procured by Gaur and handed over by Shinde. Gonsalves said through the disclosure memo, divers went into places including Mithi river and recovered a laptop and CPU which were in a “destructive state.” Gonsalves said that the custody of the accused was needed to find out who else they had contacted to eliminate Hiran. He also submitted that the accused needed to be confronted with the CDRs and the IPDRs. The prosecution said that the ATS, which was earlier probing the case, had handed over the case documents only on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-waze-constable-were-at-meet-where-hiran-murder-plotted/articleshow/81768441.cms||Rebecca Samervel

---||Chandigarh||Udyam registration a hit with city businesses||Ludhiana: City business community showed considerable enthusiasm for Udyam registration of Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) ministry. About 300 businessmen got themselves registered for the Udyam certificate at a camp organised by the Federation of Industrial & Commercial Organisation (FICO), in association with District Industries Centre, Ludhiana. Fico president Gurmeet Singh Kular said, “We organised a four-day camp for Udyam registration at our head office located at Jaimal Road. Close to 300 businessmen got themselves registered for Udyam certification by taking guidance from experts. Udyam certificate is very important for MSMEs, as it will be required by every industrial unit for taking benefit of any scheme of the Centre government. Moreover, this certificate will act as a unique identification number for the unit, which gets itself registered under this Udyam scheme of the Centre government. On the basis of this certificate, entrepreneurs will be able to get easy financing, which right now, is a very complex system.” Kular added, “We would also like to make the city businessmen aware that this certificate is free of cost and registration process is fully online, paperless and based on self-declaration. Besides this, no documents or proof are required to be uploaded for registering an MSME and only Adhaar number will be enough for registration. PAN and GST linked details on investment and turnover of enterprises will be taken automatically from government databases for registration purpose and online system will be fully integrated with Income Tax and GSTIN systems. Units which have entrepreneurs’ memorandum or Udyog Adhar memorandum registration or any other registration issued by any authority under the ministry of MSME will have to re-register themselves for Udyam. No enterprise shall file more than one Udyam registration, however, any number of activities, including manufacturing or service or both may be specified or added in one registration.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/udyam-registration-a-hit-with-city-businesses/articleshow/81765229.cms||---

Both used to live in houses located adjacently at Kanjati village in Chaubeypur area and were said to be having an affair for some time. The two had gone missing from their homes prior to ‘Holika’ festivities on Sunday evening. Their family members had launched a frantic search but to no avail. The youth was pursuing BSc from a degree college in neighbouring Kannauj district, while the girl was class VIIIth dropout. Inspector Chaubepur Krishna Mohan Rai said that the girl had left her house in the evening hours of Sunday prior to ‘Holika’ festivities along with her neighbour Shiv Veer. “In the morning of Monday, we received information about bodies of a couple hanging from a ‘neem’ tree at a distance of 1 km from their house in the Kanjati village. When we reached the spot, they were identified as the same couple,” the official said. “After conducting preliminary investigations, we shifted the bodies to mortuary for autopsy. The youth, who was the girl’s neighbour, was allegedly in relation with her for the past some time,” said the official, adding that the girl was to be married off on March 30. “After the ‘tilak’ ceremony on March 20, all the other preparations for the wedding had been completed by her family and the invitation cards had already been distributed,” he said further. But the gloom prevailed in the family of the girl as soon as the information about her death reached her house. Police later got the post-mortem of both done and handed over the bodies to the respective families.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/bodies-of-couple-found-hanging/articleshow/81768436.cms||---

---||Pune||New constraints on time lead to Pune bars losing over 70% business in two days||PUNE: A majority of city-based bars have reported business dropping by almost 60% to 70% due to restrictions that call for all establishments to down shutters by 8pm. “Earlier, our business hours were 7pm to 11pm as per regulation. Now, despite opening at 11am we are witnessing little to no customers during the daytime. Our daily business has dropped by almost 90% in the past two days,” said the manager of a bar in Kedarinagar, Kondhwa. A representative of another pub at Hadapsar said that the restricted timings aren’t in line with the operation of pubs and bars. “We mainly do business in the evening hours. People come back from their work and visit bars for a relaxed evening drink. It makes little sense for us to open during the day as patrons are busy working,” he said. Prem, who is a server at a bar in Vimannagar, said that while the bar had altered its timings, the response was poor. “Earlier, we used to open by 6pm but now we are opening at 12noon. In the last two days we have observed that patrons are not coming in. We have even tried calling up our regular patrons, who said they cannot come to a bar during the day. We have a total of 30 tables in all over the past two evenings but only three have been occupied. If this continues, we have heard from the manager that the bar will close down rendering us jobless again,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/new-constraints-on-time-lead-to-bars-losing-over-70-business-in-two-days/articleshow/81767180.cms||Joy Sengupta

Police had to intervene and convince the villagers to allow her into her home. Since villagers of Saleguda were worried about the spread of the virus, her family made arrangements for her ‘isolation’ in the fields outside the village in a farmland. A temporary shelter was made for her and a cot was also provided. The girl, who was studying in a gurukul institution, had tested positive and was sent home. With Covid-19 cases spreading in the district, the villagers felt the girl should be allowed into the village only after she recovers. Union minister of state for home G Kishan Reddy spoke out against Covid-19 patients being stigmatised. “Stigmatising Covid-19 patients is unbecoming of us, humans, and in times like this, we should help each other cope up with the pandemic. Incident involving desertion of young Covid +ve girl in Adilabad is unfortunate (sic),” he said in a tweet on Tuesday. He asked Telangana DGP M Mahendar Reddy and Adilabad SP Vishnu S Warrier to look into the matter. The Adilabad SP said Utnoor police resolved the issue. “The girl is at her home now,” he said. After the girl had returned from the institution where she had developed the infection, the family made arrangements for her stay to outside the village. The girl’s father and other family members too stayed close by in the fields where she took the shelter. “The local police convinced the family to take the girl into the village and make arrangements for her while taking all Covid-19 precautions,” Warrier said. He said the girl tested negative on Tuesday afternoon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/girl-tests-ve-barred-entry-into-village-cops-intervene/articleshow/81767182.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

---||Hyderabad||South African strain not detected in Hyderabad, but mutant present in local samples: Study||HYDERABAD: The South African strain (501Y.V2) of novel coronavirus has not yet made its way into Hyderabad, a research study reveals. The city already has the UK variant (B117) in circulation. However, researchers found that the mutation E484K, which is dominant in the South African variant, is present in local samples. UK and SA strains have been dubbed as ‘variants of concern’ as they tend to escape immune system. A team of city researchers developed a Covid-19 test method that identifies specific variants including the UK and the South African strains. Analysis of the samples using the new method by researchers from Tenet Diagnostics and Asian Institute of Gastroenterology (AIG) reveals that there is no presence of the South African strain while some samples showed the mutation E484K present in the South African variant. Researchers said development of strain-specific test methods will help in easy identification of variants that tend to avoid the immune system, and possibly nullify impact of vaccination. The result of the study was published in the pre-print medical publication, MedRxiv, on March 28. The research team comprised Safaa Muneer Ahmed, Smita Rao Juvvadi, Rakesh Kalapala and Jagadeesh Babu Sreemanthula. The team designed a primer-probe mix that specifically detects the mutated South African strain by real time RT-PCR. Samples collected during February 2021 were analysed. Later, they were validated through sequencing. It confirmed presence of mutations. “South African strain (501Y.V2) is not detected in any of our samples in this study. But, the E484K mutation that is characteristic of 501Y.V2 is detected in one mutant (N501Y),” researchers said. They said their strain-specific RT-PCR for N501Y mutation would facilitate quick surveillance for more transmissible and more vaccine resistant strains. "The virus is fighting harder to best adapt to humans and evade vaccines by mutating itself. It is necessary to study sequence variations constantly to control highly transmissible and vaccine-resistant strains," they said, adding novel coronavirus that originated in June 2020 in Wuhan, had originally the mutant called D614. Soon, it made a complete global transition to G614 mutant, probably to ensure its survival. "Now, it has further evolved into more transmissible UK and potentially more neutralization resistant South African strains. UK variant is defined by nine spike protein mutations while South African variant is defined by four spike protein mutations. Another lineage (501Y.V3) has been identified in Manaus, Brazil, and is defined by three mutations," study said warning these strains if not monitored could result in an epidemic rebound.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/south-african-strain-not-detected-in-city-but-mutant-present-in-local-samples-study/articleshow/81767210.cms||Syed Akbar

According to the notice, officials imposed a fine of Rs 2,000. This is the first such instance in the Secunderabad Cantonment, after the Telangana government issued a GO regarding enforcing wearing of masks three days ago. The Cantonment Board officials visited the supermarket and found that none of the staff had masks on. “We warned the staff about wearing masks as Covid-19 cases are increasing in the Secunderabad Cantonment area,” SCB senior sanitary inspector, A Mahender told TOI. “When we visited the supermarket again on Tuesday and found that the staff ignored our plea and were delivering groceries, we imposed a penalty of Rs 2,000 as per section 289 of Cantonment Act 2006, and served notices,” said the SCB official. Meanwhile, officials also visited China Thokatta, Pedda Thokatta and Bowenpally and asked shopkeepers and managements of malls to follow Covid-19 norms. “We warned that we will seal commercial units too,” said the SCB official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/supermarket-staff-without-masks-fined/articleshow/81767213.cms||Sunil Mungara

---||Hyderabad||‘Nutritious food can ensure best response to vaccine’||Director of the National Institute of Nutrition, Dr Hemalatha, answers questions from TOI readers on the ideal diet to boost immunity, importance of a balanced meal and why mixing oils might be beneficialQ. As an eggetarian and lactose intolerant (I can eat cheese but not milk or curd) person, what diet would you suggest to keep my protein intake good? Can I supplement my vitamin intake with any tablets or drinks? -- Sharath R A. Yes, eggs and milk provide all the nine essential amino acids (EAA). One whole egg is equal to 30g of lean meat, poultry or fish. But one egg can provide only 12% of the daily requirement of protein along with many other nutrients (vitamins and minerals). As for cheese, it is high in protein, as well as vitamins A, D, E, B12, and calcium. If you enjoy cheese, you can continue taking cheese as it is a good source of quality proteins and other nutrients. In case of a vegetarian diet, although certain EAAs are lower and some of them are not available in individual food groups of vegetarian foods, a well-balanced diet consisting foods from different food groups will mutually complement each other and supplement all the required EAA. Digestibility of amino acids is another challenge in veg foods that varies widely for different food groups and ranges from 75-85%. However, this is compensated by the presence of higher quantity of overall protein consumption from plant-based diets (vegetarian diets). A balanced vegetarian diet for a moderately active man provides about 80 gm protein/day. This translates (adjusting for digestibility) to approximately 60 gm of quality protein meeting the requirements of all EAAs. The estimated average requirement (EAR) of protein of an adult man is only 43 gm/d (0.66 grams/kg body weight /day) and the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) is 54 gm/d (0.88 grams/kg body weight /day), which can be easily met from a balanced vegetarian diet. Hence vegetarians need not worry about protein inadequacy if they are on a healthy diet with an adequate intake of pulses, beans, legumes, peas and nuts etc. Further vegetarian foods have certain other bio-active components which confer other health benefits. Also, there is no need for supplements if one is on a healthy balanced diet with adequate physical activity. For proportions of different food groups to consume to maintain good health, our institute has recommended “My plate for the day”, which can be accessed at: https://www.nin.res.in/downloads/My_plate_for_the_day.pdf Q. I am 76-years-old and had suffered from Covid-19/pneumonia in January. Though I have recovered now, I’m also borderline diabetic. Please suggest a suitable diet for me to boost immunity. -- Raghuram B A. In general, the nutritional requirements of older adults are more or less similar to that of the general adult population. However, some nutrients need special requirements among the older population because of age-related physical and physiological changes. For the sedentary elderly man and woman weighing 65kg and 55kg the energy requirements are 1700 Kcal and 1500 Kcal respectively (as per ICMR-NIN, RDA, 2020). Though the energy requirement is reduced in old age, the requirements of other nutrients such as vitamins and minerals remain the same; and the requirements of some of the nutrients such as vitamin D and calcium are increased to improve bone density. The elderly are, therefore, encouraged to consume nutrient-dense foods such as nuts, oilseeds, fruits, vegetables, legumes and moderate amounts of animal source foods to meet the daily requirements of vitamins and minerals and to prevent micronutrient deficiency. Immune cells require many micronutrients – minerals, vitamins, phytonutrients, bioactive compounds for optimal function. Hence for good Immune response: Ensure substantial servings of fresh fruits (100g/day) and vegetables (300g/day), prefer whole grains and include nuts in your daily diet. Avoid consumption of highly processed foods, avoid fruit juices and carbonated drinks - these are high in calories (energy) and poor in nutrients. There are known as empty calories, which impairs immune function. Thoroughly cooked meat/poultry may be included in moderation. If vegetarian - include legumes, beans, nuts, mushrooms to meet the required protein and micro-nutrients. Avoid too much fat (no more than 30 gm/person/day; preferably 2-3 varieties of oils), salt (<5gm/day). Sugar is just calories with no nutrients, hence, keep it to a bare minimum. Maintain ideal body weight with Body Mass Index (BMI) around 21-25. Being underweight or overweight/obese impairs immunity and increases inflammation. Abdominal girth should be 90 cm for men (80 cm for women). Moderate physical activity/yoga will reduce stress and build immunity. Keep your body hydrated with adequate water intake for good immune response to infections. Exposure to sunlight for at least 20 to 30 minutes per day, preferably around 11 in the morning will ensure vitamin D status. Smoking and alcohol adversely affect immunity and increase the risk and severity of infections and hence must be avoided. Q. There are a lot of myths around food these days. Though it is summer, many suggest avoiding cold drinks, ice-creams and cold fruit juices given the risk of a second Covid wave. Do you think it’s necessary? -- Parimala G Tadas A. Yes, in general, it’s good to avoid these things during any season. These foods are only refined sugars (also fats in ice creams), which are calorie dense and lack nutrients such as vitamins, minerals, phytonutrients. Calorie dense, nutrient poor diets impair immune response. For example: Micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) and phytonutrients that are high in fresh fruits, vegetables, greens, nuts, and whole grains play a crucial role in several metabolic pathways that aid in optimal immune function and appropriate response to the vaccine. They also keep inflammation under control. Ensure substantial servings of fresh fruits and vegetables (as much as 450 to 500gm per day per person) and prefer whole grains for optimal immune function. Q. I am 60 years and post the pandemic, I have been losing weight consistently and becoming weak day by day, despite eating all meals. I am also diabetic and insulin-dependent. What supplements can I take to build immunity and strength? -- Syed Mubbesher Mehdi A. Losing weight without any conscious effort from your side is a warning signal that you need to consult a physician immediately. Q. Since both of us are working, it sometimes gets impossible to cook every day and we resort to ordering in. Many say we should avoid it, especially with Covid. What are your thoughts? How much outside food is permissible? -- Pankaj KumarA. Whether you prepare at home or order from outside it depends on what you prepare or order and eat. Every meal should be ideally accompanied with vegetables to obtain 350 g of recommended veggies/day. A balanced/ healthy diet -should provide minimum 500 g vegetables and fruits, 20 to 30 g nuts and 200 to 300 ml milk/day (preferably in the form of curd or butter milk). Three cups of rice should be accompanied with one cup thick dal. And 50 % of your cereals may be from whole grains including millets. Whole grains, legumes, fruits, nuts, seeds are complex carbohydrates that are nutrient-packed and rich in fiber - go ahead if you can get these by ordering! Depending on your activity level and body weight you may require only 1600 to 2000kcal/day (table below). Be aware that you may get almost your total calories required for a day from just one full fried rice/biryani, restaurant curries, or a big burger. These can be very high in calories as they add a lot of fat and use refined cereals with little or no vegetables. If you order healthy diets that contain a good proportion of all food groups prepared from fresh foods, contain no sugar, are limited in salt and fats/oils- it should not be an issue to your health. But as for the COVID issue- take all necessary precautions. Q. Apart from diabetes, I have also been prescribed mild medication for hypertension and cholesterol control. With medication, all the parameters of health are under control but I am concerned that I am susceptible to infections. Is it true? How can I take care of myself during this pandemic? -- Srinivasa Rao Nandula A. It’s good that your sugar is under control and blood pressure is maintained. People with poorly controlled diabetes are likely to be at higher risk of infections and complications. You may not be at higher risk as all parameters are under control. Nevertheless, like every one, you must also follow hand hygiene, physical distancing and wearing a mask. As mentioned above include adequate quantities of healthy foods in your diet. Q. I am a housewife and regularly use mustard oil for cooking. I read somewhere that oil should be changed or mixed. Can you suggest the right mix and how does it help in deriving nutrition? -- Sumitra Ghosh A. Each vegetable oil has a unique fatty acid composition and minor components. Complete dependence on just one vegetable oil does not ensure optimal intake of all the fatty acids. Hence ICMR-NIN recommends use of two or more vegetable oils for optimal health benefits. By selecting two or more vegetable oils, not only the fatty acid balance is maintained but one also gets the benefit of minor components present. Use two or more varieties of vegetable oils in a day or you can change oils on a weekly basis to obtain the benefits of other vegetable oils. Q. What is a healthy breakfast? Is it a mix of vegetables and fruits with milk or a plate of Idlis and a bowl of curd sufficient? -- Gopinath N A. Ether should be fine, as long as you source your nutrients in a day are from different food groups -- as mentioned below in the table. Ideally, energy from breakfast should not be more than 20% of total daily energy, i.e., equivalent to 400 kcal for a 2000-kcal diet. Make sure that you get calories, protein, fats, and micronutrients from diverse food groups (8 food groups) to ensure adequate intake of all nutrients. Q. When is the ideal time to have fruits? If I have fruits after 3 pm I immediately have acidity issues? So, should I restrict them only in the morning? And since I have issues with acidity, what fruits should I avoid? -- Shruthi Reddy A. You can eat fruits any time in a day, but ideally, if you consume fruits along with a meal it may improve micronutrient absorption- a study from our institute showed that consuming guava with meals increased iron absorption and improved hemoglobin status of children. Taking fruits along with meals will also reduce chances of acidity. Citrus fruits, such as oranges, lemons, and limes and pineapples must be avoided on an empty stomach to prevent acidity. Q. What is the right temperature for storing cooked food in a refrigerator? And how long can I keep in the refrigerator and consume as we are both working and we can't cook every day. Please suggest? -- Pranesh Raj A. Cooked food should be refrigerated within two hours if one does not intend to consume within 4 to 5 hours of preparation. Our recent studies show that cooked food can stay safe up to 6 hours at room temperature and can be used up to 4 days if stored in refrigerators, which is ideally maintained at 4 degrees C. Storing food at this temperature will reduce the pace of multiplication of bacteria. Our studies show that while storing foods in refrigerators, some simple measures need to be followed - store raw and cooked foods separately to prevent contamination of microbes from raw to cooked foods. Do not thaw or reheat again and again - this will decrease nutrient contents considerably. Hence, it is suggested to store cooked food in separate small portions so that only the required amount/portion can be taken out and reheated thoroughly before consumption.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/nutritious-food-can-ensure-best-response-to-vaccine/articleshow/81767215.cms||---

City police commissioner Shamsher Singh has also ordered an inquiry against Nihir Joshi who was posted in the cell some time ago. Police department learnt about Joshi’s business after they got a complaint from a citizen whom he had offered to help him in a cyber fraud case. “The complainant was asked to deposit some money in the bank account that turned out to be of Joshi,” said Shamsher Singh, police commissioner.  Joshi and his friend were running a detective agency and its website offered to help people who were defrauded online. The constable used to promise victims that he would get them their money back. Joshi used to charge some fees for it. “It’s obviously a conflict of interest. As a cop, he can’t indulge in such activities,” Singh told TOI.  He added that after the inquiry is over, decision will be taken on the action to be taken against Joshi. The police said that as of now only Joshi has been found involved in the agency. The cybercrime cell gets hundreds of applications regarding online financial frauds every year. But all the cyber fraud complaints below Rs one lakh are now investigated by the local police stations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/cop-running-detective-agency-suspended/articleshow/81765358.cms||---

The panel, led by former high court judge Justice B Seshasayana Reddy, sought all details from revenue and irrigation officials about measures initiated for disposal of project waste. Senior officials at the site told the committee that they had acquired 203 acres of land in 2016 to set up a dumping yard close to project site. They said compensation has been paid to all but 98 land owners who refused to accept the amount fixed by government. “We have deposited the compensation amount in the court as per the rules. We have taken the land into possession as the Polavaram is a national project,” explained the official. They said that they were taking all measures to see that the gravel excavated from the project site do not slip out of the dumping yard. Committee members directed officials to submit the audit report of gravel dug out from the project and storage of the same in the dumping yard. The committee made it clear that they would look into the damage done to the ecology as a result of massive excavation involved in construction. The committee chairman said they would conduct a public hearing to take first-hand information from locals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ngt-team-inspects-polavaram-dump-yard/articleshow/81765471.cms||Samdani MN

---||Hyderabad||Qutub Shahi tombs, Golconda fort neglected, Telangana HC loses cool||HYDERABAD: Telangana high court on Tuesday told the central and state governments to furnish within two weeks plans and budgets earmarked for protecting and preserving two of Hyderabad’s important historical monuments - the Golconda fort and Qutub Shahi tombs. The judges pulled up officials of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) and state tourism and culture department for leaving the monuments in a state of neglect even after warnings from the court. The bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy also directed ASI’s director general and the secretary of state, tourism and culture department to appear before the court to assist it in ensuring there is no further dilapidation. The bench had taken up the case after reading a report in TOI on October 23, 2020, on the plight of these monuments. “People are finding it difficult to venture into these areas after 5.30 pm because it becomes completely dark and there is no lighting at all,” the judges said and directed the authorities to immediately provide lighting all over the fort and the tombs. . “Do not tell us about what you are doing,” Chief Justice Kohli said when Rao said the authorities had filed counters. “Better go there and see what is happening on the ground. The entire area plunges into darkness after evening and no one would even think of visiting them. I will appoint you as amicus curiae and send you to them. I am telling you this with personal knowledge,” she asserted. She added that all that government counter said was that the fort walls got damaged due to incessant rains and the damages were assessed and proposals were sent by ASI’s director-general to the central government for restoration work. “The counter says nothing about whether the approval came or not. Whether restoration work was done or not, the counter is silent about it.” The Chief Justice added that tourists from all over the world would visit these monuments and the authorities have no arrangements to showcase them. “What is stopping you from lighting up the fort? You will get revenue also. What is the current footfall of visitors and how much revenue did you earn from them?” the bench asked. Rajeswara Rao sought time to file an additional affidavit. “The case of Qutubshahi tombs is even more pathetic. Nobody is attending to it. You do not believe in restoring the glory of these historical monuments,” the bench said, addressing state counsel Harender Pershad and Centre’s ASG.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/qutub-shahi-tombs-golconda-fort-neglected-hc-loses-cool/articleshow/81767223.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha
---||Nagpur||NMC to work in 2 shifts for last rites of Covid deceased||NAGPUR: With a rise in Covid-19 fatalities in the city, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has decided to start shifting bodies from all dedicated Covid hospitals to cremation grounds from 8am. Currently, the NMC shifts bodies to the crematoriums from 10am, said a senior NMC’s health department official. The rise in the number of coronavirus fatalities has added to the workload of NMC health staff in performing last rites of deceased. “The NMC will also increase one bus to ferry bodies from two the government-run hospitals – Government Medical College and Hospital and Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital – which are reporting the most deaths,” he said. Though cremation of bodies at the NMC’s crematoriums start from 6am and is allowed till 8 pm. However, the mortuaries of both the government hospitals open at 10am and then only the NMC’s health department staff starts shifting Covid-infected bodies to crematoriums for last rites. The department continues to shift bodies till 7pm. “As number of deaths from these two government hospitals were more, the NMC used to give first preference to the Covid-19 bodies from GMCH and IGGMCH,” the official said. This delayed the shifting of bodies from private dedicated Covid hospitals to the cremation grounds. From April 1, the NMC will start shifting bodies from 8am and will focus on bodies at private hospitals during morning hours. “Two buses will be deployed at the NMC headquarters at Civil Lines, while one bus will be attached to Gandhibagh zone, which will only focus on shifting bodies from Mayo hospital,” the official said. Another aspect delaying shifting of bodies from hospitals to the city's crematoriums was the choice of cremation grounds. “Relatives insist that the NMC cremate their kin’s body to their nearest crematoriums, which too has increased the workload,” said the officer. To a query, the officer said the NMC is not allowing cremation of Covid-19 bodies in small cremation grounds like at Friends Colony. At present, the NMC is managing this with 50 sanitary workers. Now, it will increase the manpower to 76. Sanitary workers, who were deployed to lift bodies, too complained of facing difficulties due to wearing PPE kits from morning to evening. The civic body plans to utilize the manpower in two shifts and hopes to resolve this problem too, said the officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-to-work-in-2-shifts-for-last-rites-of-covid-deceased/articleshow/81767214.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Kanpur||Shivpal gives Holi celebrations at Mulayam Saifai residence a miss||Kanpur: Schism between the Yadav clan was out in the open during Holi festivities on Monday as SP chief Akhilesh Yadav’s estranged uncle Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party (Lohiya) boss Shivpal Yadav celebrated Holi a couple of 100 metres from clan patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav’s residence in Saifai, where the rest of the family had assembled to celebrate the festival of colours. This was the second time Shivpal did not participate in Holi revelry at his elder brother Mulayam’s residence where the entire clan traditionally gathers on Holi every year. Earlier, in 2019 (Lok Sabha election year), though Shivpal visited Mulayam on the eve of Holi, he did not stay back to join the celebrations on the day of festivities. As Shivpal gave a miss to the tradition on Monday, Akhilesh along with party’s general secretary and Mulayam’s distant cousin Ram Gopal Yadav, former Badaun MP Dharmendra Yadav, former Mainpuri MP Tej Pratap Yadav, former Firozabad MP Akshay Yadav and zila panchayat chief Abhishek Yadav, besides other relatives celebrated the festival of colours at his ancestral house. Shivpal celebrated the festival separately along with his son Aditya Yadav at Sughar Singh Memorial School in Saifai. Mulayam is known to play Holi with family and village folks in Saifai every year. As a tradition, he celebrates Holi at his native residence in the middle of the lawn. Party workers, supporters, relatives and friends shower flower petals and put ‘gulal’ on him to seek his blessings. He could not join the revelry this year owing to his illness. In his absence his son Akhilesh welcomed local folks and joined the revelry. He greeted the crowd and appealed to them to celebrate it in the spirit of love and brotherhood. When questioned about his uncle Shivpal’s absence from his function, Akhilesh said, “He must be playing Holi somewhere else.” While attacking the ruling BJP government, Akhilesh claimed “it will be the last Holi for Yogi Adityanath as the chief minister of state”. “People are fed up with BJP and have have made up their mind to play next year’s Holi with a new government. It will be the last Holi for Yogi Adityanath as the Chief Minister of the state,” he claimed. Akhilesh said, “This government has set up a new record of discrimination and there are innumerable examples where people and officers are being discriminated against by their castes and religion affecting development of the state.” He further alleged that his government had brought lions for Etawah Safari, but instead of launching safari in Etawah, Yogi Adtyanath took the lions to Gorakhpur so that his native place could not attain limelight on the world’s lion safari map and become a tourist spot. “The BJP government is deliberately dilly-delaying projects and schemes launched by the Samajwadi government. He (CM) is inaugurating projects which were launched by my government. They have now even started changing plaques,” he said. He said that people of the state will teach them (BJP) a lesson in upcoming panchayat polls. “If they do not adopt unfair means during panchayat polls, it will be the beginning of the end for the present government,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/shivpal-gives-holi-celebrations-at-mulayam-saifai-residence-a-miss/articleshow/81768488.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

Soon, eight patients undergoing treatment at the emergency ward were shifted to safer places. The fire was later doused with fire measures installed at the institute itself. The first incident of fire took place at 4.15 am on Tuesday following a short-circuit in the AC and tube-light in the ceiling of the emergency ward. Hospital staff evacuated the eight patients undergoing treatment and shifted them to other wards. The fire was later doused by fire extinguishers installed at the ward itself by the cardiology staff. In yet another fire incident, curtains at the room no: 1 of emergency caught fire following which duty staff immediately swung into action and doused the fire with water. “Two incidents of minor fire were reported from the emergency ward of the Laxmipat Singhania (LPS) Institute of Cardiology in the early hours of Tuesday. Though cardiology staff had sought assistance from us, by the time our fire tenders reached there, the duty staff had managed to control the fire using fire extinguishers installed at the premises itself,” said senior fire officer Surendra Choubey. To recall, about 140 patients were rescued after a major fire broke out at the Laxmipat Singhania (LPS) Institute of Cardiology on Sunday morning. No patient was reported injured or dead.

Vipin (32) married Renu (23) in 2020 after the death of his first wife and the couple had differences over his two children born from the first marriage. Police found Renu’s body lying on a bed while Vipin was found hanging from a fan in a room bolted from inside. The circumstantial evidence suggested that the husband first strangled his wife and then ended his own life by hanging, said police. Renu’s uncle Bhurelal said, “Renu’s mother, who had gone to meet her, found them dead. We informed police. The couple had differences, but we were trying to iron it out amicably. We don’t know what happened last night. It appears that Renu was murdered, but we would wait for the autopsy report.” Vipin’s cousin Asaram, however, said, “We feel that Vipin committed suicide as he was upset with his wife’s behaviour.” Additional SP (city) Sanjay Kumar said, “We are waiting for the autopsy report to confirm the reason for the deaths. It was Vipin’s second marriage. His two children were with their grandmother at the time of the incident.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/husband-wife-duo-found-dead-inside-locked-house/articleshow/81765262.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Alpana, 25, and her brother Anuj, 19, were arrested along with two others — Alpana’s boyfriend Sanjesh and his friend Madan Yadav — who allegedly aided them on Monday. “The siblings were unhappy with their father Sunil Kumar’s lifestyle and association with women. He had sold off several bighas of farmland and was about to sell another six bigha for Rs 20 lakh,” police said. This, reportedly, led to a verbal confrontation. Alpana and Anuj then allegedly planned to murder their father, and recruited Sanjesh and Madan to execute the plan. They set a date, March 26. “Alpana acquired the murder weapon, the leg of a wooden cot, and gave it to Madan,” station house officer of Bah police station Vinod Kumar told TOI. Madan then entered the house and allegedly beat Sunil to death while he was asleep. “Alpana said she was asleep when the murder took place. But her mobile call details and WhatsApp activity showed she was online at the time and speaking to Sanjesh,” SHO Kumar added. The murder weapon was found in a field nearby and two similar cot legs, on the terrace. Alpana, Anuj and Sanjesh were booked for murder and criminal conspiracy, while Madan was booked for murder and causing disappearance of evidence of offence at the Chitrahat police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/upset-by-fathers-illicit-ties-siblings-kill-man/articleshow/81766205.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Retd HC judge Chandiwal to probe ex-CP’s charges||MUMBAI: A week after the MVA cabinet took the decision to institute a probe by a retired judge, the state government on Tuesday appointed Justice Kailash Uttamchand Chandiwal, a former judge of Bombay high court, to investigate charges of irregularities and corruption levelled by former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh against home minister Anil Deshmukh in his letter of March 20. Chandiwal has been asked to submit his report within six months. However, the inquiry will not be held under the Commission of Inquiry Act. The order promulgated by joint secretary Somnath Bagul states that it will be a one-man high-level inquiry committee. According to Bagul’s order, Chandiwal will probe if Singh has submitted any concrete evidence either against Deshmukh or any official from his department to establish that an irregularity or crime has been committed by the minister or his staff. Secondly, he will probe if the contents of the letter establish any crime by the minister or his staff which requires a probe by the Anti-Corruption Bureau. The order states Chandiwal could also give any other recommendation as he thinks proper. The order is silent on the row over the death of Dadra-Nagar Haveli Lok Sabha member Mohan Delkar, who committed suicide in a Mumbai hotel on February 22. Singh had alleged in his letter to CM Uddhav Thackeray that Deshmukh had set a “collection target” of Rs 100 crore a month for police officers, including API Sachin Waze. The letter had also alleged that Deshmukh had forced Mumbai police to file an abetment to suicide case in Delkar’s death though the then CP felt the Dadra-Nagar Haveli police ought to look into the matter. Singh’s letter further fuelled the controversy that had arisen since a car laden with explosives was found parked outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence, resulting in the arrest of API Sachin Waze. After Waze’s arrest, Singh was shifted to the post of Director General (home guards), following which he wrote the letter. Though Singh had initially been silent, Deshmukh had said a couple of days after Singh’s transfer that it was not routine but owing to serious lapses in the Antilia bomb scare case, which reportedly upset the former city police chief. The order on the probe by Chandiwal came a day before Bombay high court takes up for hearing Singh’s PIL on Wednesday. Earlier, Singh had moved Supreme Court against his transfer and also demanded a CBI probe into charges of corruption against Deshmukh. The SC had asked him to move the HC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-retd-hc-judge-chandiwal-to-probe-ex-cps-charges/articleshow/81768504.cms||---

Dust allergens, particularly minute protein particles shed by pets like dogs and cats through skin and urine, are harmful to people with compromised immunity. The study involving Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) Research and Analysis Centre, was carried out in Mumbai, Bangalore and Delhi, besides Hyderabad. Dust samples were analysed for as many as 11 contaminants present in Indian households. The study revealed that Hyderabad had the high percentages for dog allergens and particulate size more than 20 micrometres. The dust samples also contained bacteria, fungi, dust mites, cat and cockroach allergens. Dyson was also associated with the study. As part of the study, dust samples were collected from 27 surfaces in Hyderabad, including sofa, carpets and cars, from localities like Attapur, Somajiguda, New Malakpet, Madhapur and Gandhinagar. The study revealed that bacteria were found up to 8.4x106 cfu/gm (colony forming units per gram) while fungi up to 1.6x106 fu/gm (fungal units per gram). The dust mite allergens collected from faeces of pets and pests ranged up to 1.97 ng/gm (nanograms per gram). In the case of cockroach allergens, the maximum range was 93.4 ng/gm and in case of pet allergens, it was 4.06 ng/gm for cats and 4.28 ng/gm for dogs. Normally, the allergens do not affect many healthy individuals. However, they can cause severe health issues in people with compromised immunity and those with allergies to dust. People suffering with asthma are at a higher risk.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/high-concentration-of-dog-allergens-found-in-city-study/articleshow/81767234.cms||Syed Akbar

By the time help could reach her, the baby boy had died. A video of the woman lying unattended in a semi-conscious state next to her dead boy went viral on Tuesday, sparking widespread outrage. A local, who made the video, narrated how he dialled 108 but failed to get any help. In the video, he shows the PHC and also two ambulances parked in its vicinity. “I saw a driver, but he said he cannot bring the woman to the hospital as there was no doctor there,” he was heard saying as he walks around the PHC. The lone doctor had sought leave for the day due to a medical emergency in his family, authorities said. Deputy district medical and health officer of Medchal Dr N Narayana Rao said the hospital staff were not aware that the woman was pregnant. He said the woman could have delivered a stillborn baby. He said the woman was in her eighth month of pregnancy and the baby may have died in the womb. He said she was identified as Lakshmi from Medchal. Dr Narayana Rao told TOI that a staff nurse found the woman lying under a tree on the PHC premises and approached her. The woman, who has filariasis (a parasitic disease caused by an infection), reportedly told the nurse that she was suffering from pain in the leg. “The nurse gave her a tablet. After some time, she approached the woman again and asked her to come inside the hospital. The woman said she was waiting for her sister,” Dr Narayana Rao said. The deputy DMHO said the health centre staff, however, had no clue that the woman was pregnant and added that she had only complained of pain in her leg. “When the nurse went later to check on her, the woman was not there,” he said. Jawaharnagar police official Madhu told TOI that they reached the spot on being informed about the woman on ‘Dial 100’. “We sent her to Gandhi Hospital with two escort personnel,” he said. The health authorities also said the woman was first brought to the PHC and then sent to Gandhi Hospital. The infant’s body was also sent to the hospital. Police are trying to ascertain from the woman about her family though she told them that she has no one.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/woman-delivers-on-road-near-phc-baby-boy-dies/articleshow/81769526.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

Daily vaccination figures from Pune have also surpassed Mumbai's coverage. The state capital, ever since the vaccination drive opened on January 16, has been recording impressive coverage numbers. But recent data shows Pune region has been consistently recording over 35,000 doses administered per day, higher than the Mumbai suburban region. Pune district administered 38,409 doses on March 25; 38,061 on March 26; and 38,145 doses on March 27. That's nearly 1.15 lakh doses in three days till Saturday. On March 25, Mumbai suburban region administered 25,789 doses; 30,068 on March 26; and 28,397 on March 27. On these days, Pune also had the highest number of vaccinations in the state. Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, said, “As the vaccination drive progresses, many government officials are now stepping forward to help with the programme. But the main reason for the increase in vaccinations is that more and more citizens are now coming forward to get vaccinated as cases have gone up again. We are seeing significant drops in vaccine hesitancy, which was a problem when the drive started." Dr Deshmukh said many initial problems have been resolved. “CoWIN is now working seamlessly; without any glitches. Also, Pune district started with 55 vaccination sites; it now has 328 sites. The number will again be increased to 600 from April 1. These are all the reasons behind Pune's good vaccination rate." Zilla parishad CEO Ayush Prasad, said, “Pune district has been carrying out the highest number of vaccinations in the state. We have maintained this lead through the week now. The Pune rural administration recently completed the vaccination of nearly a quarter of the projected population of intended beneficiaries in rural areas.” Dr DN Patil, state immunization officer, said the drive picked up pace in Pune soon after the surge in cases. "Many more people now want to be protected against Covid-19. Scores were also on wait-and-watch mode. But they are all now more confident of vaccine efficacy and safety."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pune-district-vaccination-coverage-now-highest-in-state/articleshow/81766252.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Bhopal||Limited lockdown to continue in worst-hit districts, says Madhya Pradesh CM||BHOPAL: Chief minister, Shivraj Singh Chouhan, on Tuesday asked for continuation of thermal screening of all the passengers coming from Maharashtra. He made it clear that limited lockdown would continue in districts, which are reporting more cases of coronavirus infection. The CM also said that districts, which have been able to contain the spread of Coronavirus infection by involving masses, should be emulated by others. CM, who was reviewing coronavirus situation in the state, was told that Khandwa administration has been able to contain coronavirus by involving railway administration and self-help groups in its efforts. Guna and Burhanpur districts have also done well on this front. Chouhan said, the strategy employed in these districts to curb the coronavirus infection must be followed in other districts too. Chouhan also talked to all the divisional commissioners about coronavirus situation in districts under their charge. He asked them to increase the number of beds for Covid-19 patients at the divisional level. He said about 1/3rd districts are reporting more coronavirus cases in the state; patients from these districts should get proper treatment facilities at the divisional level. CM also asked for accelerating the pace of vaccination against Covid. It was informed at the meeting that till March 29, 32.35 lakh people had got vaccinated in the state. Shivraj asked the officers in-charge of various districts to tour the districts under their charge and see if the works being carried out to contain the Covid-19 infection. He said, proper treatment facilities for coronavirus patients must be ensured and review of testing of suspects, treatment and isolation of patients should be regularly carried out. The officers in-charge should also monitor that decisions taken for control of coronavirus are properly implemented in districts assigned to them, CM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/limited-lockdown-to-continue-in-worst-hit-districts-says-cm/articleshow/81767245.cms||---
---||Pune||Maharashtra Covid death rate below 0.5% despite surge in March||PUNE: Maharashtra in March reported a steady decline in the Covid-19 fatality rate despite the rapid increase in positive cases, data has shown. The death rate on March 7 was 0.4%. It then dropped further to 0.3% in the week ending on March 28. Experts said better treatment protocols, shaped by a year’s worth of medical experience, have helped doctors stop Covid from progressing into severe states in scores of patients. In the first week of March, Maharashtra had 64,657 new cases and 324 deaths — a fatality rate of 0.5%. Cases then rose steadily. Between March 22 and March 28, the state had as many as 2,34,193 cases. During this week, 782 patients succumbed to the disease. The number of deaths did go up during this period, but the rate stayed at 0.3%. “The low death rate has been the silver lining during this phase of the pandemic,” said Dr Shashank Joshi, an endocrinologist and a member of the state Covid-19 task force. “A majority of patients are showing mild symptoms and are recovering. This wasn’t the case last year. The overall fatality rate in the state has dropped too — on February 1, the progressive death rate stood at 2.5%; by March 28, it had dropped to 2%. In contrast, the state’s caseload, which was just about 2,000 new cases daily in late January and early February, shot up to over 40,000 — a 20-fold increase in two months. The state’s positivity rate is now 20%, up from 13% in February. A senior doctor treating Covid patients in Pune said experiences from last year have helped improve healthcare systems and response. He said many medicines that failed to have an impact have been discontinued and doctors have now understood the importance of high-flow nasal oxygen. But specialists warned that delays in seeking treatment can cut chances of recovery. “Patients should get treatment at the earliest. Doctors now know all the medication and treatment that should be given to a patient depending on her/his condition. Proper care and attention at the onset of symptoms boosts chances of recovery,” said another doctor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maha-covid-death-rate-below-0-5-despite-surge-in-march/articleshow/81766274.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Two elderly Covid patients in Nagpur end life||NAGPUR: Two senior citizen Covid patients, including an 81-year-old found dead with oxygen pipe around his neck inside a bathroom of Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) on Monday, ended life in city within 13 hours. The other elderly man, aged 68-year-old, ended life at his home at 85-plot locality in Ajni on Tuesday. A patient of kidney stone, the 68-year-old man had tested corona positive on March 26. His elder son, daughter-in-law and 12-year-old grandson too were positive and are recovering. “My father had been suffering from kidney stone for the last three decades. It seemed his pain aggravated after the Covid treatment began. He was also upset with the positive status of my elder brother, his wife and their son. All these must have pushed him to take the drastic step,” said the younger son of the deceased. “We have not informed my elder brother and his family about the suicide as it may aggravate their condition,” he said. These two were probably first incidents Covid patients ending life back-to-back in the state since the pandemic’s outbreak. In Vidarbha, the 81-year-old was the fourth Covid patient to end life while the 68-year-old man became the fifth one. So far, similar suicides have been reported from Akola, Bhandara and Washim. The 68-year-old one was the only one to end life at home while the rest did so at medical facilities. The elder of the two victims used oxygen pipe to hang himself from the exhaust fan inside the bathroom of the basement newly converted into 80-bed Covid ward. He had come alone to GMCH on March 26 for a check up following breathlessness and uneasiness. After testing positive through rapid antigen test, he was admitted into basement ward. According to a GMCH source, the 81-year-old man had medium severity with oxygen requirement of around two to three litres/minute. “The patient had confided with a ward staffer about feeling lonely and abandoned. But we cannot allow patients’ kin into Covid ward,” said a GMCH source. Dr Kanchan Wankhede, acting medical superintendent, said an inquiry would be set up to look into lapses, if any. “We would assess the entire episode and take corrective measures and also pull up anyone found responsible,” he said. He said a guard had been deployed at the basement ward now. It is learnt the 81-year-old man was last seen by the medical staffers and attendant at around 11.30 am when the morning dose of the medicines were distributed. In the afternoon the patient was found untraceable and an alarm raised. The sanitation staffers initially failed to trace him but during a subsequent search a bathroom door was found shut with no response from inside. The door was forced open and the elderly citizen was found hanging. The ward staffers alerted the GMCH authorities who then informed the Ajni police. Police said a case of accidental death had been registered. The cops are still trying to find out the reason behind the drastic step. A relative of the deceased expressed his wonderment regarding the suicide. “He had come to hospital on his own and got himself tested without help or support. He had never shown any suicidal tendencies at home. It is a surprise for us as to why he ended life,” said the kin. Senior inspector of Ajni police station Vinod Choudhury said, “We have not found any suicide note in both the cases.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/two-elderly-covid-patients-in-city-end-life/articleshow/81767239.cms||---

---||Bhopal||MP’s positivity rate triples in 20 days, but testing rate stays low||Bhopal: There is an acute need for caution, seeing the way coronavirus cases have increased in the last few days. What is even more alarming is that it's not only the number of positive patients but also the positivity rate, which has spiralled across the state. In the past 20 days it has more than tripled. Earlier, 3.1 out of every 100 persons who were tested were found positive on March 10, but on March 29, nearly 10 out of every 100 people tested, were found positive. As per norms positivity rate above 5 is considered high but as of now it has increased nearly to 10. With this positivity rate, there has been an increase in the number of active cases. While on March 10 there were only 3915 active cases, the number increased to 15150 on March 29. Thus while an increase of more than 200% in positivity rate was reported, number of active cases increased by more than 400%. However despite the increase in the positivity rate, sampling and testing has not increased in the same proportion. Sample this: On February 1, the positivity rate was only 1 % in the state and 15017 samples were tested. The positivity rate has now increased by nearly 10 times to 9.9 but only 23249 samples were tested on March 29, thus while positivity rate increased by nearly 900%, testing increased by only around 50%. Sources said , less testing could lead to spread of cases as identification and isolation are the only ways to contain the spread of the viral infection, and state has been fairing poorly in terms of tests per million compared to its counterparts since the start. of the pandemic Till March 29 this year, only around 75000 tests have been conducted on every million population. Overall a total of 6345761 tests have been conducted from the beginning of Covid-19 till March 20, 2021 in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/mps-positivity-rate-triples-in-20-days-but-testing-rate-stays-low/articleshow/81767251.cms||Amarjeet Singh

Pawar (80) was diagnosed with a gallbladder-related problem on Sunday when he was rushed for an emergency checkup to Breach Candy Hospital. A day later, Malik tweeted that Pawar would get admitted on Wednesday for endoscopy and surgery. Pawar, a cancer survivor, was asked to stay off blood-thinners ahead of the surgery. On Tuesday, though, he was rushed back to the hospital due to the pain. “Attention please, our party president Sharad Pawar saheb was supposed to be admitted in hospital for endoscopy and surgery procedure tomorrow, but since he is experiencing some pain again in the abdomen, he is admitted in Breach Candy Hospital in Mumbai today,” Malik tweeted on Tuesday. In a video statment, he said the future course of action and operation schedule would be decided by the concerned doctors. Breach Candy Hospital officials refused to comment, stating the Pawar family had maintained media updates would be given out by them or NCP officials. Hospital sources said Pawar was detected with gallstones following an endoscopy. Gallstones are stone-like objects often made of cholesterol or bilirubin that can develop in the gallbladder or bile ducts and cause pain. Treatment options can involve minimally invasive surgery to remove the gallstones. Pawar is admitted under physician Dr Pratit Samdani. Sources said he was stable and recovering, and likely to undergo surgery by Friday or Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-pawar-in-hosp-a-day-earlier-due-to-abdominal-pain-says-malik/articleshow/81768540.cms||---

---||Bhopal||Bhopal: 6.5 lakh from 45+ age group to get Covid shots from April 1||BHOPAL: From April 1, around 6.5 lakh of the city’s population would be eligible to get vaccinated against Covid-19. Union government’s recent decision allows all citizens above 45 years to get vaccinated, starting from Thursday. With an anticipated rise in vaccination jabs, health department has expanded its facilities. Currently maximum 12,000 doses per day have been administered to cover over 2.20 lakh people, but the new plan is to cater to 50,000 beneficiaries per day, said district immunisation officer, Dr Kamlesh Ahirwar. Both Covishield and Covaxin vaccines will be available for all people above 45 years of age. The endeavour began with health workers, frontline workers and then targeted those above 60 and above 45 with co-morbidities. Over 40000 people have been fully inoculated with both doses of the vaccine in Bhopal. According to health department estimates, the demand for vaccination through paid for vaccination in private centres is just about 10 per cent of all doses administered. Underutilisation of private facilities is an unanticipated pattern. On Tuesday, when government vaccination facilities were offline and private were functional, only 517 people got vaccinated by shelling up Rs 250 for each dose. Another factor, health department is coming to terms with is the hesitancy among the beneficiaries to opt for online booking for vaccination. The facility saves time, however, most people are favouring offline and on the spot registration, which takes more time and adds to the delay.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/6-5l-from-45-age-group-to-get-covid-shots-from-apr-1/articleshow/81767261.cms||---

---||Chennai||3.5m MobiKwik users’ data up for sale on dark web||In a major data security lapse by a private entity, 8.2 terabytes — the largest such breach in India — consisting of personal information of 3.5 million users, allegedly of payments platform MobiKwik, is up for sale on the dark web. While several independent cybersecurity researchers have been reporting about a likely data breach of MobiKwik’s servers as early as February, French security researcher Robert Baptiste (Elliot Alderson on Twitter) confirmed the hack on Monday. The breach includes names, email addresses, list of installed apps, location data, hashed passwords and partially-masked credit card numbers and photos of KYC documents. While MobiKwik denied any data breach on Tuesday, it however said in a blogpost: “The company is closely working with requisite authorities, and is confident that security protocols to store sensitive data are robust and have not been breached. Considering the seriousness of the allegations, and by way of abundant caution, it will get a third party to conduct a forensic data security audit.” It said, “When this matter was first reported last month, the company undertook a thorough investigation with the help of external security experts and did not find any evidence of a breach.” “Some users have reported that their data is visible on the dark web. While we are investigating this, it is entirely possible that any user could have uploaded her/ his information on multiple platforms,” it added. However users, who claimed they had searched through the leaked data on a site, said they were able to find personal details uniquely saved on MobiKwik in it, tying the breach to the platform. “Some of my data is there. In fact even the accurate date for the creation of my Mobikwik account, in 2013, is there,” Nikhil Pahwa (@nixxin) tweeted on Tuesday. MobiKwik also received a lot of flak from Twitter users for shifting blame on customers. Cybersecurity researcher Rajshekhar Rajaharia, who first made public the breach on February 26, told TOI he had written to MobiKwik about the breach on February 24, and also communicated to RBI and CERT-in later in the first week of March but had not heard back. Both correspondences were seen by TOI. “This was likely a breach of their server and users should change their passwords on all websites immediately,” Rajaharia said. As per Rajaharia, a dark web forum originally advertised the data in February. Rajaharia claims that once he warned MobiKwik over email, the firm must have taken measures to stop the hacker from downloading the data as the hacker then posted saying they lost access to the servers. But, again on March 27, the hackers claimed that they had recovered all data and put it up for sale for 1.5 bitcoin (roughly $86,000). Another ethical hacker, who wished to not be named, also shared with TOI a communication that shows a MobiKwik employee writing to data services provider Amazon Web Services to fix a leak in their servers and share logs. TOI could not verify the authenticity of this correspondence. Cybersecurity specialists TOI spoke to said personal details, when combined together, could be valuable for hackers and identity thieves, and if unmasked, the leak of credit card numbers could also be an issue. However, MobiKwik maintains that all financially sensitive data is stored in encrypted form in their databases and misuse is not possible. As of July 2020, MobiKwik counted 120 million users and 3 million retailers on its platform.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/data-breach-8-2tb-up-for-sale-on-dark-web/articleshow/81768546.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

---||Nagpur||Staff alleges misappropriation in Chanda engg college||Chandrapur: Teachers and employees of Shri Sai College of Engineering and Technology, a private college in Lonara, Bhadrawati tehsil, have alleged that the college management is deducting half of their salaries in the name of development funds since over a decade and denying them the benefits of the Sixth Pay Commission. They have also charged the management of deceiving the Fee Regulating Authority (FRA), Mumbai and the charity commissioner in yearly audit by showing payment of full salaries in their name. Assistant professor Ashish Milmile alleged in a press conference that the college was hiring professors and employees for fixed pay since its commissioning 12 years back. He said that instead of paying the salaries as per University Grants Commission (UGC)’s regulations, the management was deducting half of their pay every month. “The management had claimed it was using the deducted salaries for the development of college and had assured that once the institution was fully developed, it would pay the cut salaries with interest after 10 years. Despite repeated pleas, employees have not been paid their deducted salaries,” Milmile charged. He added that the Sixth Pay Commission was implemented in August 2015, yet the college’s teachers and employees were paid 50% salaries, and there was no pay hike after 2015 up till August 2020. The hike given in August 2020 was “a meagre 25% dearness allowance (DA) and 5% House Rent Allowance (HRA)” from the Sixth Pay Commission, he said. The assistant professor demanded a fair inquiry into the matter through the university complaint redressal committee. He also charged that the management reported inflated staff strength to the government for hiking fees. While there were around 98 employees in college, he said, the management showed posting of 138 employees in 2017-18 and raised it to 142 employees next year. Milmile said that the college management had taken scholarship funds of around Rs55.20 crore from the government, but used nearly Rs13 crore for salaries of teachers and staff and misappropriated rest of the funds. He sought the appointment of an administrator and a fair inquiry into the matter. When contacted, secretary of the institute Amit Yergude claimed that all the allegations levelled by the teachers and other employees were false and baseless. He maintained that the management was paying regular salaries along with depositions against gratuity, insurance and employee provident fund. He also claimed of rolling out salary hikes to the employees recently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/staff-alleges-misappropriation-in-chanda-engg-college/articleshow/81767267.cms||Mazhar Ali

A series of pictures show the leopard, that was crossing the road, getting hit by the bike and fleeing. The leopard and three villagers, devotees riding on a bike, received minor injuries. The accident took place near Adda Balaji temple area on Saturday. The accident took place near Adda Balaji temple area .No ban on motorbikesMandir Marg passes through the forest area and connects the main entrance of RNP with the Ganesh temple situated inside the fort. The road, which runs along the core area, is open for private vehicles on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday. However, there is no ban on motorbikes. The road is open for private vehicles on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday.Speaking to TOI, Sridhar Sivaram, who was on a fullday safari, said, “The Ranthambhore forest authorities should regulate free movement of people on this road. If it were a tiger, the incident could have become bigger.” TC Verma, chief conservator of forest, RNP, said, “We have already imposed restrictions on free movement of private vehicles on busy days. It was an unfortunate incident which occurred.” The leopard and three villagers, devotees riding on a bike, received minor injuries.'Close encounters' of pilgrims and tourists with wild animals on this road have become a regular affair. On January 21, tourists returning from Ganesh temple had a close encounter with a tiger after it jumped on a wall, where they had parked their vehicle. A recent study by a group of experts, ‘Challenges Presented by Pilgrimage Sites and Their Impact on Ecology of Protected Areas’, pointed out that1.2 million pilgrims go to the Ganesh temple every year. So many pilgrims are able to go deep into the tiger reserve by flouting norms and easy availability of transport.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/leopard-hit-by-devotees-on-a-bike-inside-ranthambore-park/articleshow/81768551.cms||---

A division bench of justices M M Sundresh and S Ananthi was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by B Stalin, an advocate fromMadurai. The petitioner stated that since the inception of the Vaigai dam, no desilting works have been done. Due to this, there is a possibility of silt deposit up to 20 feet, eventually affecting the water storage capacity of the dam. Due to lack of supervision, water thefts were taking place from Moola Vaigai to the dam. He stated that a mechanism should be put in place for continuous monitoring in order to prevent the water theft. He further stated that few people have also encroached the water storage area of the dam and are involved in agricultural activities. Though the farmers from Theni, Madurai, Sivaganga and Ramanathapuram districts have brought these issues to the notice of the officials by submitting several representations, no steps were taken in this regard. Hence, the petitioner moved the HC Madurai bench.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/plea-in-hc-to-desilt-vaigai-dam-water-storage-area/articleshow/81767272.cms||---

He alleged that the minister had met with subordinate police officers, including suspended assistant police inspector Sachin Waze, and asked for collection of Rs 100 crore.Deshmukh had denied all the allegations in the letter. Singh’s counsel Vikram Nankani and Sunny Punamiya mentioned the matter before a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni and sought an urgent hearing. Singh wants urgent orders for “safe custody of the CCTV footage” outside the minister’s residence, before any of it is lost. There were two more PILs filed, one by Divesh Vora, who says he is an activist and the other by Mohan Bhide, a senior citizen, chartered accountant and a teacher and managing director of Bhide Education Pvt Ltd, who have also sought an independent probe into allegations made by Singh against Deshmukh. Vora’s PIL also sought a CBI inquiry into Singh’s allegations against Deshmukh and safe-keeping of CCTV footage outside the minister’s house, but he also challenged the “constitutional” validity of the Maharashtra Police Act’s (2014) Section 22N(2) which gives the state allegedly unfettered powers to transfer police officers without sufficient reasons. Vora also challenged the validity of Singh’s transfer order dated March 17 as “illegal and arbitrary” and sought its stay as an interim relief till the PIL is finally decided. The fourth petition, not a PIL, filed first in point of time, by city advocate Jaishri Patil for a probe against Deshmukh and Singh’s “role” based on the ex-police chief’s letter to the CM, came up before a bench of Justices S S Shinde and Manish Pitale. The bench questioned her “locus standi” (right to be heard) verbally, saying, “Prima facie we are of the opinion that such petitions were filed for popularity.” Advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni also questioned the petition and later said the state would seek clubbing of all similar petitions. The bench adjourned Patil’s petition to April 1.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-to-hear-singhs-plea-seeking-cbi-probe-today/articleshow/81768558.cms||---

He was campaigning for candidates of his party and its alliance in the assembly constituencies of Tenkasi and Virudhunagar districts on Tuesday. At Alangulam in Tenkasi, Stalin said Modi was uttering lies. He ridiculed the PM for raising the hands of chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami and deputy CM O Panneerselvam even while saying that corruption would be eradicated. At Rajapalayam in Virudhunagar district, he said Modi during his visit to Dharapuram has stated that there would be no safety for women if DMK and Congress came to power. “Are you aware of the horrific Pollachi incident and the incident where a woman IPS officer had lodged sexual harassment complaint against the special DGP of the state,” he asked the PM. He also asked whether Modi had bothered to resolve the issues of farmers striking in Delhi for hundreds of days by speaking to their representatives. Referring to the resolutions passed by Kerala and West Bengal assemblies against the Centre, Stalin said CM Palaniswami, who is referring to himself as a farmer, has not passed such a resolution in the TN assembly. Instead, he called the farmers brokers, he said. He claimed that BJP will continue to score a ‘zero’ in this election as well. Stalin said though he campaigns at all places by appealing to the people to vote for DMK and its alliance candidates, in Rajapalayam he was asking the people not to vote for minister for milk and dairy development K T Rajenthra Bhalaji.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/stalin-poser-to-pm-on-corrupt-tn-mins-pollachi-incident/articleshow/81767279.cms||---

They have machineries and also charge high prices for washing but they have sounded the death knell for our job,’’ he said.Governments have never been sensitive to their needs, said Baalu, adding that in the last five years they have not been receiving the free iron boxes that the government had been giving them for decades. ``Our people in Jaihindpuram, Aruldosspuram and Kalmedu got free iron boxes way back in 2016, after that even this welfare measure has stopped coming,’’ he said.``The AIADMK’s poll promise of free washing machines only shows that they are not sensitive to the needs of the people of our community as we rely on our skills and don’t use washing machines,’’ said K Rani, a woman who was ironing clothes in Simmakkal.Baalu says they are among the smaller communities in the MBC category and reservation has not helped them much as the number of people from their community in government jobs can be counted easily. Some job assurance or reservation would help this community, he said.Many people of the community live along the banks of the river Vaigai, but now with the wall being constructed along the banks, their entry into the river has been restricted. Dhobi ganas could help them. Madurai central MLA P T R Palanivel Thiagarajan had constructed one for these people in his constituency and now the MDMK candidate of Madurai south, M Bhoominathan, has promised another for those in his constituency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/washing-machine-freebie-exposes-insensitive-aiadmk-washermen/articleshow/81767299.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Setback to Telangana, waqf as HC says Hafeezpet land private||HYDERABAD: The Telangana government and the state waqf board on Tuesday suffered a setback as the high court ruled that the entire extent of 140 acres in Hafeezpet in Rangareddy district is private land and neither revenue nor registration officials could stop its registration. According to real estate experts, an acre in Hafeezpet costs around Rs 30 crore and at this rate the entire extent is worth Rs 4,200 crore. Ordering mutation of 50 acres in favour of three petitioners — Katikaneni Praveen Kumar, Sai Pavan Estates and a few others, the judges also directed the government and the waqf board to independently pay costs of Rs 50,000 to each of the petitioners. One of the petitioners, Praveen Kumar, was allegedly even kidnapped by former AP minister Bhuma Akhila Priya and her followers and later rescued by police a few months ago in a dispute over the same extent of land. Putting an end to the efforts of the government and the waqf board to claim rights over the land in survey number 80 in Serilingampally mandal, a bench of Justice MS Ramachandra Rao and Justice T Vinod Kumar said: “This land is neither state land nor waqf land. This is pure private land.” The judges gave this ruling after the petitioners approached the court challenging the action of the government and waqf authorities to usurp the title from them. Setting aside the AP Waqf Board notification (issued on December 13, 2013) attaching 140 acres in survey number 80 to Dargah Hazrath Salar-e-Auliya, the judges said the action of the waqf board was against principles of natural justice and goes counter to the very provisions of the Wakf Act itself. The judges also directed the state government to delete the unlawful entries made by the officials in revenue records to show it as a state land. Entries made in Muntakhab by waqf officials were also told to be removed. Muntakhab is a certificate of grant issued by the commissioner of inam, revenue department. The judges asked the government to sub-divide the land in survey Nos. 80 as 80/A, 80/B, 80/C and 80/D in pursuance of the final decree and the settlement deed (bearing document No. 2630 of 2016) and mutate the names of Praveen Kumar and others. They agreed with the argument of senior counsel V Ravinder Rao and advocate KS Murthy who said the state in the past had lost the case in the Supreme Court several times and was only reinventing methods to raise the litigation though it had no case to argue at all. Petitioner’s counsel Zeeshan Adnan Mahmood said the judges also found fault with a gazette notification (issued on November 1, 2014) by the state government declaring Hafeezpet land as a waqf land and set it aside.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/setback-to-t-waqf-as-hc-says-hafeezpet-land-pvt/articleshow/81769539.cms||---

The obscene remarks “lower the dignity of motherhood of women”, the EC notice said. Sources told TOI that the poll panel will be sending the reference seeking a CBI probe by Wednesday. “Since the alleged bribery relates to elections and has happened during the period when model code of conduct is in force, EC is competent to seek a CBI probe. Earlier, after raids carried out in Madhya Pradesh during 2019 Lok Sabha polls led to huge recoveries of unaccounted cash, EC had sought a CBI probe on similar lines,” said a senior source. The EC has also ordered the transfer of J Loganathan, commissioner of police, Trichy, to a non-election related post and suspension of Thiru Tamilmaran, ACP, Golden Rock Range. The commission, meanwhile, acting on a complaint received by the chief electoral officer from the AIADMK, over the “derogatory and scandalous speech” made by A Raja against the chief minister at an election campaign last Friday at Thousand Lights assembly constituency, gave the DMK MP time until 6pm on Wednesday to explain his position, “failing which the EC shall take a decision without any further reference”.  As per the model code, “criticism of other political parties, when made, shall be confined to their policies and programme, past record and work. Parties and Candidates shall refrain from criticism of all aspects of private life, not connected with the public activities of the leaders or workers of other parties. Criticism of other parties or their workers based on unverified allegations or distortion shall be avoided”. According to the transcripts, Raja, at Keelapur speech at 19.00hrs, made a statement, among others, that Stalin is a child of good relationship and good birth while Edapadi Palaniswamy is a child of bad relationship and a premature born child . Also, in his Meensurupatti speech at 20.30 hrs, EC said “you have stated that...’But EPS who considers that he is having knowledge and Dignity, just for the sake of CM post, crawled and held Sasikala’s feet who is almost equal in age or to say who is 6 months younger”. The transcript also said EPS was “born in an illegal manner, in a premature birth”. In the alleged bribery case involving DMK candidate K N Nehru, acting on information that bribe was being given to law enforcers ahead of polls, special teams headed by senior officers in the rank of an assistant commissioner of police conducted checks at the Government Hospital police station and at the Thillai Nagar police station last Saturday and found several covers containing cash amounting to thousands of rupees. Both the police stations fall in Tiruchi West constituency from where Nehru is seeking a re-election. A case against the police personnel was registered by the City Crime Branch on a complaint lodged by a senior police officer in the rank of an Assistant Commissioner of Police under IPC section 171 (e) (bribery) and under section 129 (3) of The Representation of People Act. Six police personnel were suspended in connection with the incident including an inspector of police of Thillai Nagar station; a sub-inspector of Government Hospital police station, a special sub-inspector of Government Hospital police station and a woman head constable attached to Thillai Nagar police station besides two other personnel serving in the City Intelligence Section tasked with looking after Government Hospital police station and Thillai Nagar police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/dmk-in-ec-crosshairs-a-raja-gets-notice-cbi-may-probe-cop-bribery/articleshow/81768564.cms||Bharti Jain

Palasi police station SHO cum DSP (probationer) Azaz Hanif Mani told TOI over phone that the deceased were identified as Barkash (4), Ali Hassan (5), Dilnawaz (5), Ashraf (5) and his sister Gulnaz (4) and one Khushniha (6). Governor Phagu Chauhan and CM Nitish Kumar expressed grief over the accident. In a press statement, the CM office said a cheque of Rs4 lakh was handed over to each of the four aggrieved families as ex gratia payment. He said the accident took place around 12.30pm and the entire hut made of dry straws was engulfed in flames within a few minutes, giving no chance to anyone to rescue the children trapped inside. “Villagers told the police that the children might be roasting the wheat earrings brought from the nearby fields, causing fire. The wind was also strong at the time of the accident,” he said. “When it caught fire, they hid inside the hut out of fear and didn’t raise any alarm,” Mani said. He said the position of the bodies indicates that all six had hugged each other tightly out of fear at the time of accident. Mani said a fire tender had reached the spot within few minutes but nothing could be done as dry straws burned very quickly. “Police also reached the spot within ten minutes,” he said. Mani said the bodies were handed over to their parents after postmortem. “The bereaved families are very poor. Besides ex-gratia payment, the district administration also provided Rs3,000 to each family under Kabir Anteyeshti scheme for performing the last rites,” he said. He said a case of unnatural deaths was registered with Palasi police station in this connection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/two-siblings-among-6-kids-charred-to-death-in-araria/articleshow/81767303.cms||Debashish Karmakar

While the number was less than the 4,000 challans that were being issued daily on average, officials said it was a huge achievement considering the usual places of public gathering remained deserted on Monday. Delhi Police registered 72 cases for violating Covid-19 safety guidelines. While 871 people were prosecuted or arrested, 1,696 vehicles were impounded. Four incidents of gathering were also reported. Most violations were registered in West district followed by Outer. District authorities issued the highest number of challans (607) of over Rs 12 lakh in North district and collected about Rs 1.5 lakh on the spot. Central District saw the least number of challans (74) of around Rs 1.5 lakh. On the spot collections were Rs 30,000. South district saw 16 enforcement teams being deployed, but only 94 challans were issued, the second lowest among all districts, with a total fine of Rs 1.8 lakh and Rs 1.6 lakh collected on the spot. In all, 18,521 challans were issued by the district authorities in the last five days, with the most (4,034) being issued on March 27. The total fines imposed during this period was about Rs 3 crore and around Rs 1.6 crore was collected on the spot. Police said due to awareness campaigns and strict presence of cops on the ground, only two accidents took place this year compared with 23 last year and 28 in 2019. Chinmoy Biswal, Delhi Police spokesperson, said the force had made elaborate arrangements to ensure that DDMA’s guidelines regarding Covid-appropriate behaviour were strictly enforced. Traffic pickets were placed at major intersections. In addition to local policemen, reserved companies were also deployed. Special attention was given to the university area, hostels and paying guest accommodations and policewomen were deployed in plainclothes. Representatives of residents’ welfare associations were also roped in as force multipliers. Meanwhile, a video of people claiming that cops had doused a Holika dahan went viral on social media. Police clarified that a section of people were spreading rumours online. “We were suppressing fire using buckets after residents complained that the flames were rising and could burn the low-lying wires and boards of several shops,” said a police officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/holi-penalties-challans-worth-rs-51-lakh-issued/articleshow/81767290.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Bhopal||Bhopal: Order to shut places of worship not effective||BHOPAL: Order of the district collector, Avinash Lavania, to ban the entry of devotees at places of worship has not been effective. Most of the places of worship are open for people. It appears that the order to close down religious places in the wake of spurt in coronavirus cases has either not reached the management of religious places or it has not been properly understood. Prakash Malviya of Badwale Mahadev temple, said , “It’s only the Bhavani temple which is closed because police and administrative officials are around that temple all the time. Otherwise, all the temples, mosques and other religious places are open. We are requesting people to have darshan of the deity online and not come to the temple but if some devotees come, they are allowed to enter from the rear side for darshan.” Confusion over the order was clear when priest of Birla temple, K K Pandey, said, “The temple was closed for two days because of lockdown. We have opened the temple today. People have stopped coming here once again due to fear of coronavirus, only 7 persons have come for darshan so far but we didn’t receive any order for closure of the temple beyond Holi.” Gurucharan Singh, of Bittan Market Gurudwara, said, “There are far less people coming to Gurudwara ever since there is hue & cry over spiralling cases of Coronavirus but Gurudwara is open.” He said “The administration convenes meetings with representatives of each religion to decide on the issues like this and one or two persons from each community attend the meeting. If a decision to keep the religious places closed has been taken, people who attended the meeting must be knowing about it and the temples, mosques and Gurudwaras they belong to must be closed but other places of worship are open.” Shahar Quazi, Syed Mustaq Ali Nadvi, when asked about opening of temples and mosques despite the district administration order to keep them closed, said “It’s a general order. Committees looking after the management of respective mosques should see to it that the order is complied with and prayers are performed in a closed mosque.” Fr Maria Stephen, spokesperson for Catholic churches in MP and Chhattisgarh, also appeared to be confused when he said that 20 persons have been allowed at a time in a religious place and accordingly in churches, where a lot more people attend the services, service would be performed online but in small churches with smaller presences of devotees, service would continue in the church itself. The fact is that district collector Avinash Lavania had allowed 20 persons in a religious function and it had nothing to do with the order for closure of religious places.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/order-to-shut-places-of-worship-not-effective/articleshow/81767278.cms||Ashutosh Shukla

Medical experts are fearing a surge till April 15, and by May, cases may start declining.” He said other restrictions, which were earlier enforced, would remain and no public gatherings at open spaces, marriage palaces and cremation grounds would exceed 20 persons. Dayalan said as Covid cases and deaths continue to escalate, with the UK strain emerging the most prevalent in the state, Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh has ordered extension of curbs till April 10, while directing the health department to increase the number of vaccination sites to target priority categories. He said, “The positive cases and deaths were rising rapidly in Mohali and positivity is likely to be high in the younger population of age 40 years or less.” He said employees of restaurants, hotels and night clubs, which have to close down by 8:30pm or 8:45pm, were allowed to travel home after 9pm only by showing valid identity cards issued by their employer.

---||Chandigarh||Delay in RT-PCR reports hits patient isolation, contact tracing||CHANDIGARH: At a time when Chandigarh is under a critical stage of Covid high positivity rate, the RTPCR reports are coming after two to three days. This affects patients’ isolation and contact tracing, say public health experts. PGI tests 600 samples a day and GMCH 200, yet the reports are getting delayed. While these hospitals deny the delay, there are patients who have faced it. Sources in the UT health department say the reports of RTPCR are coming after 48 hours of sampling. “GMH-16 did not give my report even after five days. Besides, there is no proper sitting arrangement for those coming for test. We had to wait for over 1.5 hours for registration before our samples were collected,” says a patient who had come for RTPCR test. GMH-16 collects the swabs and sends them to GMCH-32 and PGI as it does not have a RTPCR testing facility. “We have signed an MoU with three private laboratories, which submit reports within 24 hours of taking samples. This helps check delay in reporting time,” says UT director, health services, Dr Amandeep Kang. Sources in the PGI say the Indian Council of Medical Research had given an RTPCR machine to the institute which could test 1,000 Covid samples at a time. However, the machine is now not being used often as its cartridge is to be procured from China. Denying this, PGI director Prof Jagat Ram says, “We are using the machine with an Indian company-made cartridge. However, if the company does not supply us more cartridges, we might face issues. We are doing 600 tests for Chandigarh and the rest for the institute.” Sources say there have been times when the samples collected by the UT health department were returned after being refused by GMCH and PGI. “There is a facility for storage of samples for a week or so. But this delays the reporting time and also defeats the purpose of isolation and tracking,” says an official in the UT health department. The Union ministry of health and family welfare had asked the city’s officials to enhance their RTPCR testing from 40% to more than 70%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/delay-in-rtpcr-reports-hits-patient-isolation-contact-tracing/articleshow/81766336.cms||Shimona Kanwar

---||Mumbai||NIA: Waze driver left SUV with explosives near Ambani’s home||Mumbai: Arrested assistant police inspector Sachin Waze’s personal driver drove the explosives-laden Scorpio and parked it near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence early on February 25 while Waze was at the wheel of the Innova that tailed the Scorpio, the investigation by the National Investigation Agency has revealed. The story of the Scorpio began on February 17, when its owner Mansukh Hiran parked it on Mulund-Airoli Road, claiming it had developed a technical snag. Sources said that Hiran handed over the keys the same day to Waze at his office at the city police headquarters. Waze’s personal driver (name withheld) collected the Scorpion the next day and drove it to Thane and parked it in the premises of Saket housing society, where Waze resided. On February 19, the driver took the vehicle to the police headquarters at Crawford Market and parked it there, the source said. The car remained there and on February 21, the driver drove the car back to Waze’s housing society, where it remained till the night of February 25, when the driver drove to South Mumbai and parked it near Ambani’s residence early on February 25. “Waze himself was in the Innova SUV tailing the Scorpio till the industrialist’s residence. Waze’s driver then got into the Innova and they left. Officials said the Innova was seen crossing the Mulund toll naka only to return sometime later with a different number plate and was seen near Antilia. Waze, who was then wearing a kurta pyjama, went near the Scorpio and placed the threatening letter,” an official said. The NIA is probing the planting of explosives and the subsequent murder of Hiran, whose body was found in a creek in Mumbra on March 5. Officials said they are joining the dots so that the complete picture is clear, including the motive. “This is probably the reason that the two DVRs -- one at the police headquarters and one at Saket society – were destroyed. We believe the DVRS would have contained images of the vehicle movements,” an official said. Waze has reportedly admitted to the crime ranging from stealing of the Scorpio and planting of gelatine sticks but not revealed anything on his accomplices who aided and abetted him in the crime, a source said. Officials are also probing if any of his senior officers had knowledge of the conspiracy. Meanwhile, the NIA on Tuesday recovered a Mitsubishi Outlander which was found abandoned in Kalamboli two days before Waze’s arrest. This car is registered in Waze’s name. This is the sixth high- end car recovered by the NIA in the case so far, and they are still looking for an Audi and a Skoda which Waze were using. The NIA is likely to take custody of CCTV footage of the Mumbai police headquarters on Wednesday. The ATS had written to the Mumbai police early this month to preserve the custody of the CCTV footage of 45 days, from February onwards. The investigators want to know the set of people who came to meet Waze during this period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/nia-waze-driver-left-suv-with-explosives-near-ambanis-home/articleshow/81769536.cms||Ahmed Ali

The first offering of the event was ‘Adaab Premchand,’ directed by Mukesh Sharma. The event that aimed to showcase the best of Urdu plays, had a handful of people on the inaugural day, even as all the Covid-19 protocols were duly followed. But that didn’t diminish the pleasure of watching a well-honed play.  Those who couldn’t attend the event, followed it on various social media platforms, where it was streamed live. Speaking about the endeavour, director of Urdu Academy, Nusrat Mehdi said, “The Urdu drama festival is an annual event, organised on a large scale by the academy. But in view of the current circumstances and growing cases of Covid-19, we decided to make it a two-day event this time. We started on a very small scale on Tuesday, but due to certain unavoidable circumstances, we have to postpone both the plays that were scheduled for day-2, on March31.” She, however, went on to add that such festivals are a must to promote each regional language and give a vast platform to the actors, writers, directors and many other technical experts who are involved with stage and theatre. Latika Gupta, a theatre buff, was really saddened by the fact that the plays lined up or Wednesday had to be postponed.  “I understand that this decision was probably taken as a safety measure during the second surge of Covid-19 cases that are growing at alarming pace. But still I’m disappointed and hope this event will be staged in its full glory, soon,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/amid-covid-urdu-drama-fest-begins-but-no-events-on-day-2/articleshow/81767335.cms||Vinita Chaturvedi

They said the old conductor had to be replaced with a new cable. “Tree branches were touching the conductor due to which the timer was not working. We removed the conductor and replaced it with a cable,” said Srinivas Reddy, zonal commissioner (GHMC), Secunderabad. After the issue was resolved the GHMC officials also inspected other lights along that stretch. “Our inspection showed that the other lights on the lane were working properly,” said a civic official part of the inspection. According to locals, the issue with the streetlight had been persisting for two months, before officials fixed it. It had been on, non-stop. “We reported the issue to authorities but it was not resolved. We are thankful it has finally been fixed and electricity is no longer being wasted. With summer upon us, it is important to monitor the electricity consumption,” said Srivasths Puranam, the citizen reporter who highlighted the problem. Another citizen from Yapral said that regular inspections should be done to ensure the electricity is not wasted. “Onus of ensuring electricity is not wasted lies with people too but the streetlights are not under the control of individuals. Authorities should conduct periodic inspections to check for dysfunctional streetlights including the ones that glow in the day to reduce power consumption,” said the senior citizen. In GHMC limits there are over four lakh streetlights installed. The contract for this was given to Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL). Usually, when a complaint is raised regarding them, GHMC officials inform the agency who then get the issue fixed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/power-wastage-from-streetlight-fixed-in-yapral/articleshow/81768570.cms||---

In weekly positivity rate too, it remains at the second slot after Maharashtra with 12.8% figure, while the national average is 5.8%. In the past one week, the number of new infections has grown by an average of 1% or more every day. Also, for every 100 confirmed cases, around 10 are currently infected. In the past two weeks, the city has seen 3,377 cases. From March 18 until September-mid last year, the active cases rose in six months to over 2,700. But these have now increased in the past three months to over 2,700. “This second wave is more transmissible. It is mainly due to the non-compliant behaviour of the public rather than the mutant virus. It was found that out of some 11,064 samples, 855 had those new variants. So, we need to follow Covid appropriate behaviour strictly,” said a public health expert. The Union ministry of health and family welfare, on Tuesday, asked the health authorities of the states and UTs to review the geographical spread of infection and identify possible sources. “There is a need to have a serological surveillance in the city. We have no idea about how many have developed antibodies after vaccination in the city. This will help us focus on those areas or sections of people who are vulnerable and need protection, so that fatality rate can be managed,” said an epidemiologist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/after-maha-and-pb-city-shows-over-1-weekly-avg-case-growth/articleshow/81766385.cms||Shimona Kanwar

---||Delhi||Delhi Board will ensure high standard of education for all children, says Sisodia||New Delhi: Delhi Board of School Education (DBSE) held its first general body meeting on Tuesday, which was presided over by deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia. He said that the board would bring next-generation reforms in the education sector.“Delhi Board of School Education is crucial towards ensuring high quality education for all children. Our work in the last six years has changed the perception of government schools in India. This board will bring next-generation reforms in education and changes in the evaluation process, which will now be a 360° process, where we will holistically assess the knowledge, attitude and skills of a student,” said Sisodia.Elaborating on the need for a new board, the deputy CM said the requirement was three fold. “First, it will move away from the practice of rote-learning and towards giving a holistic picture of each learner...Secondly, it will emphasise on continuous formative assessments. The main aim of setting up the board is that the assessment system should become a partner of learning and not an authority of testing. Third, we want to encourage a growth mindset among students, which will be strengthened by making it a part of regular assessment,” he explained.Sisodia further said, “DBSE will also empower teachers to achieve their full potential by giving them timely feedback on specific actions they take to help every child in their classroom.” Delhi cabinet had approved the setting up of DBSE on March 6, after which the society for the board was registered on March 19.Delhi’s education minister is the president of the board and principal secretary (education) the vice-president. The board also has principal secretary (finance), director education, Delhi Commission of Protection of Child Rights chairman, SCERT director, principal advisor to director education and vice-chancellors of Delhi Technological University, Ambedkar University and Delhi Skill and Entrepreneurship University as ex-officio members.Principals and teachers, two educationists, two representatives of industries, two school management committee members are among those in the nominated category.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-board-will-ensure-high-standard-of-education-for-all-children-says-sisodia/articleshow/81767355.cms||---

The deceased has been identified as M Danasekaran, 17, from North Street in Gandamanur. He was studying in Class XII in the government higher secondary school. B Seeman, the accused was his classmate. As Danasekaran was good in academics, Seeman’s mother used to make comparisons between them. Irritated by this, Seeman often picked up a fight with Danasekaran. On Monday morning too, there was a fight, but the other students intervened and brokered peace between them. But, Seeman continued the scuffle again during lunch break, when Danasekaran was sitting outside the class. In the heat of the argument, he took out a hammer and hit Danasekaran. He suffered injuries on his head and fell unconscious. The teachers sent him to the Theni Medical College Hospital from where he was referred to the Government Rajaji Hospital in Madurai, where he died. Based on a complaint from Danasekaran’s father V Murugan, a case was registered with the Gandamanur police station under the IPC section302 (punishment for murder).

---||Lucknow||For 1st time, myriad colours of Holi at Ramjanmabhoomi||Ayodhya: Holi was celebrated with grandeur on Monday at Ramjanmabhoomi for the first time in decades after the Ram Lalla idol was moved out of a makeshift structure in March last year. Celebrations at the Ramjanmabhoomi temple drew scores of pilgrims on Holi, which was also marked by the euphoria of the Ram temple construction after the 2019 Supreme Court verdict handed over land to Hindu parties. Last year, celebrations were muted as the deity was still inside a tent. On Monday morning, Ram Lalla was gently smeared with ‘abir’ and ‘gulal’ and in the afternoon, the deity was bathed and dressed in white before gifts and ‘prasad’ were offered. The ritual was witnessed by large number of devotees, who came to Ayodhya from different parts of the country. The court of Ram Lalla was decorated with natural colours, gulaal and flowers of over a dozen varieties. The premises Ramjanambhoomi was also decorated with flowers, specially brought from different states, said Acharya Satyendra Das, chief priest of the temple. “Ram Lalla stayed in a tent for three decades and was kept away from festivity. Now, he has blessed his devotees on Holi after his birthplace was liberated after 500 years,” said Das. Speaking to TOI, Dr Anil Mishra, member of Ayodhya temple trust said, “After Mughal king Babar’s commander Mir Baqi attacked the premises in 1528, Holi celebration was limited to traditional rituals. Five hundred years later, Holi is being celebrated with grandeur in the court of Lord Ram. A new era has begun.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/for-1st-time-myriad-colours-of-holi-at-ramjanmabhoomi/articleshow/81768575.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

The registered value of the attached land was Rs 152 crore, ED said. The agency claimed that its money laundering probe found that the Chandras “illegally diverted” more than Rs 2,000 crore to the tax havens of Cayman Islands and Cyprus.These “proceeds of crime” (black money) were allegedly routed to India through shell companies controlled by the family in Singapore and land worth hundreds of crores was purchased in Gurgaon, the agency claimed.“ED attached 12 land pieces with an area of 48.5 acres situated in Gurgaon. The registered value of these land pieces comes to Rs 152.4 crore and are owned by promoters of Unitech group through proxy/benami entities,” the agency said in its attachment order.The benami companies have been identified as Crown Infra Projects Pvt Ltd, Kore Communities India Pvt Ltd and Joshu Gurgaon SEZ Pvt Ltd. “These three companies are part of one Trikar Group/Kore Group which is the benami investment of the Chandra family,” the agency said.The ED’s money trail began after it initiated an investigation under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act against the Chandras based on multiple FIRs by Delhi Police.“For purchasing these properties, funds were transferred through Singapore-based companies Joshu Pte Ltd, Trikar Residential Developers Pte Ltd and Trikar Property Opportunity Pte Ltd during 2015-2020,” the ED claimed.The agency claimed it has traced the source of funds in these Singapore-based companies to Cayman Islands-based entity Trikar Fund Limited SPC which was allegedly being controlled by the Chandra family through another Cayman-based entity Trikar Asset Management Ltd SPC.ED said evidence of illegal investments were seized during searches conducted earlier at 35 premises in NCR and Mumbai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ed-attaches-48-acres-in-gurgaon-claims-chandras-own-land-through-benami-firms/articleshow/81767369.cms||---

Sources said Sanjay Akela alias Sanjay Yadav was taken into preventive custody along with two others after a brawl between two groups in Mayaganj under Barari police station area. An assistant sub-inspector (ASI) of police was also injured in the brawl. Locals alleged that Sanjay’s condition deteriorated during interrogation in police custody and he later died at JLNMCH. Bhagalpur SSP Nitasha Gudia has suspended Barari SHO Pramod Shah for mishandling the law and order situation. “There was a law and order problem in the area on Monday night after the scuffle between two groups. The accused, Sanjay Yadav, was taken into preventive custody by police for interrogation. He fell ill and was rushed to the JLNMCH where he died,” the SSP said. “An investigation has been initiated into the incident and steps for judicial probe are also being taken. Further action against the guilty persons would be taken as per the guidelines of National Human Rights Commission (NHRC),” she said and added: “So far, no evidence of police atrocities or high-handedness against Sanjay has surfaced in the CCTV camera footage.” The SSP said Sanjay’s family members have also been shown the CCTV footage. “We are, however, probing the incident as per the complaint from Sanjay’s family. Local residents are also being asked to come forward to help the police in the probe,” she said. Police personnel have been camping in Mayaganj since Monday night. Sources said the scuffle took place after children of Sheesh Paswan and Ramswaroop Paswan of Paswan Toli had a fight with the children of Lucho Yadav of Gwal Toli (also in Mayaganj) during Holi celebrations on Monday.

---||Delhi||Leopards settle down in better Asola||NEW DELHI: At least two leopards have been living in Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary in south Delhi for the past six months. Their movements have been observed near the abandoned mining pits in the area. Forest officials said leopards were considered a transit population at the sanctuary, but with the habitat improving now, the big cats have become residents. Over the years, the sanctuary has recorded an increase in the population of prey base for the cats, including monkeys, jackals and nilgai, even as the forest authorities have managed to minimise trespassing, put up boundary walls and created waterbodies to improve the habitat for wild animals. There have been several sightings of the leopards in the last few months, with the latest being on Tuesday afternoon. “A staffer was coming from Bhatti camp to the forest office when he sighted a leopard atop a hill near Devli in the afternoon,” disclosed a forest official. He added that there earlier were indirect and seasonal sightings of the big cats, but forest staff are now spotting the animals, while indirect sightings like pug marks have increased. Even tourists visiting the sanctuary have reported seeing a leopard. Another forest official said the spotted cats have been mostly sighted around the mining pits and near Bhatti Neeli Jheel. It is believed they strayed into the 6,874-acre sanctuary from the Aravali range. Amit Anand, deputy conservator of forests (South), confirmed to TOI that while leopards were sighted in Asola on-and-off in the last five years, now it appears the animal has taken up residence in the sanctuary. Anand says a quiet lockdown period and enrichment of habitat inside the sanctuary played big roles in this. “We created check dams and increased water availability for the animals, and the leopard has been sighted near ponds several times,” said Anand. “We also stopped people from entering the sanctuary on motorcycles or cars, so they no longer disturb the wildlife. The animals are thriving as a result and the leopards have adequate prey.” Anand admitted to difficulty in ascertaining the exact number of the cats in the sanctuary, though he affirmed two. “We feel that there are more than two leopards. It could be a family,” he said. The first sign of the presence of a leopard inside the sanctuary came last year near a place where the forest department feeds monkeys. “We observed on one occasion that the food remained untouched. On close observation, we found pugmarks of a leopard,” explained an official. Delhi is no stranger to leopard sightings. Earlier this year, a leopard was caught on many CCTV cameras in Najafgarh, where pugmarks were earlier recorded, leading the forest and wildlife department to set up a trap for the cat. However, the leopard couldn’t be captured and forest officials believe it has left the area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/leopards-settle-down-in-better-asola/articleshow/81767390.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Will run 60,000 Covid tests/day to flush out virus, says Iqbal Singh Chahal||MUMBAI: The BMC wants to flush out the coronavirus by conducting the maximum number of tests per day and isolating positive persons, municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal said on Tuesday after receiving the first dose of the Covid vaccine at the BKC jumbo facility. The maximum tests conducted so far in one day are 48,057, and Chahal said by early next week, the plan is to crank it up to 60,000 a day. Chahal explained increased testing would automatically mean more cases, but it is needed to take out the positive cases and isolate them so that the chain of spread can be broken. “The positive numbers, whether 6,000 or more, are immaterial as long as the mortality is under control and every needy person is getting a hospital bed… Hence we are not shying away from conducting tests and plan to touch 60,000 a day. I will make it in the coming Tuesday-Wednesday. I would even be happier to go beyond that as well. Currently, the city is conducting close to 50,000 tests a day for the past 4-5 days,” said Chahal, adding that this may lead to the number of positive cases going to 9,000-10,000 per day. But this would not be a cause for worry as many may be asymptomatic. The civic chief stressed on Covid-appropriate behavior. “In Mumbai, 2.4 million have been fined for not wearing masks and Rs 48 crore have been collected...Due to this, even if people may not be wearing masks properly, everyone is with masks now. My further appeal to citizens is they should show Covid-appropriate behaviour by putting on their masks properly and ensure there is no crowding,” said Chahal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-will-run-60000-covid-tests/day-to-flush-out-virus-says-chahal/articleshow/81768584.cms||Richa Pinto

The project will be set up at an initial cost of Rs 3.5 crore and include management of all civic services, including road sweeping, central verge, walkways, toilet cleaning, drain desilting, damage repair and others. “Shahjahanabad Redevelopment Corporation Board of Delhi has been entrusted with the responsibility of redevelopment of the Walled City through PWD and making the stretch vehicles-free. The 1,400m-stretch from Lal Qila to Fatehpuri Masjid has many historical buildings. While the project work is under progress, the civic body intends to maintain the stretch and its infrastructure, including four toilet complexes, in a world-class condition and has decided to engage a private agency for facility management services,” the proposal stated. The project will be implemented in two years from the date of allotment of the contract. “The private concessionaire will be allowed to place advertisements at the four toilets at Lajpat Rai Market, Bhagirath Palace, Fountain Chwok and Town Hall Press Building. Besides, it can also use the upper floor of the third toilet for commercial purposes. The term of the contract can be extended,” said an official. Apart from cleaning, desilting and maintenance of civic services, the agency will also be responsible for transportation of garbage/silt/ malba to the designated site and other related jobs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/pvt-players-to-manage-civic-services-in-old-delhi/articleshow/81767395.cms||Vibha Sharma

---||Hyderabad||My new friends: Neighbourhood furries||By G Thirda Reddy The pandemic brought with it a mixed bag of emotions and learnings. While on the one hand it created havoc in the lives of many, on the other hand, it also taught us to be better human beings. It helped us realise, all over again, that there is still light at the end of a dark tunnel. And finding that ray of hope is what’s important to keep up the positive attitude. My lockdown story started like everybody else’s -- wake up, eat, sleep, repeat. As the days of lockdown keep stretching, my studies also shifted online, which wasn’t always very exciting. The daily routine and seeing the same walls in my house, soon, turned out to be boring. The toughest part in all of this was not being able to go out. But like they say, every dark cloud comes with a silver lining. Since there was nothing important going on in my day-to-day life, I started observing things around me, more keenly. I began observing how people from nearby localities were throwing garbage and waste near our house. It had become a daily routine. As a result of this unhealthy practice, the area turned into a den for stray dogs who gathered there in search of food. The image was both bothersome and heart-wrenching. Unable to keep my calm over this, I finally decided to take matters into my own hands and capture some images of this menace and send it to civic authorities. To my surprise, it did work. While at first there was a delay on the part of the municipality staff in coming to collect the garbage from the area, I now see them visit often to clear the space. I also salute the staffers for turning up for work, even in the middle of this pandemic. Apart from this, since I realised that the pandemic was proving to be a distressing time for pets who lost their homes, and animals living on the streets, I decided to feed them. Now, it has become a habit and I see more and more of them come to me, in hope of food. It gives me great joy to see them wagging their tails with happiness when they see me. This lockdown has taught me that there are little things we can do as individuals for the betterment of our society. I believe that taking care of society is not just a responsibility it’s a privilege, and I don’t want to take it for granted.

Intense sanitisation had been done before re-opening. In two of the schools, exams were also held, one of which was a Board practical exam. At St Lawrence High School, a teacher had tested positive while two Board students in La Martiniere for Boys and Frank Anthony Public School (Faps) contracted Covid. All the three schools shut off their campuses and asked teachers to take online classes. Schools said that they did not receive any reports of any symptoms from teachers and students who had been on campus alongside the infected people and the campuses re-opened after a gap of eight days. At St Lawrence, Class XII students gave their HS practical exams on Tuesday. Lab practicals for biology, statistics and computer applications were held in two shifts. A little over 100 students gave their exams on the first day, said principal Father Sebastian. At Faps, the pre-Board exams were on when the campus was shut and so these exams re-started for both classes X and XII. “We have sanitised extensively and kept strictly to the Covid protocol and hope that all goes off well now,” said principal Ian Myers. “As far as the boy who is ill is concerned, we will let him take complete rest and then arrange accordingly,” he added. La Martiniere for Boys, too, was in the midst of the rehearsal exams, as the pre-Boards are called here. However, the school administration decided not to postpone these till the campus re-opened and switched over to the online mode immediately. Teachers were also asked to work from home. On Tuesday, teachers were asked to resume work on campus and students were not called in, said school secretary Supriyo Dhar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/three-shut-schools-reopen-after-eight-days/articleshow/81766433.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

People stood on the sides of the road in Alaganganallur, Solai Alagupuram, and Jaihindpuram where his vehicle passed by. People were there to assist him and were seen whispering in his ear to wave, which he did. “It was sad to see the leader who was active and an angry politician in 2011,” said K Balasubramaniam, a fan who had come to the Periyar bus stand on coming to know that Vijayakanth’s vehicle would be passing through that place.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/vijayakanths-first-campaign-in-south-lacklustre/articleshow/81767409.cms||---
---||Madurai||Tour guides stare at an uncertain future||The industries hit by Covid-19 and lockdown are slowly limping back to normalcy, however there is no sign of relief for the tourism sector for now, which provides jobs for thousands of people. The worst affected among them are tour guides who have taken up other jobs, no matter how menial they are, as revival is not in sight any time soon. There are more than 500 recognised tourist guides in the state who are specialized in handling domestic as well as foreign tourists. In Madurai alone, there are not less than 100 guides, with a major chunk of them into handling domestic tourists in and around Meenakshi Amman Temple. At least 50 of them handle foreign tourists. Degree holders are made to undergo training programmes and take up exams to get identity cards, which is valid for two years, say tourism officials. While the domestic tourists like to hear legends and puranas associated with religious places, foreign tourists would want to know about art, architecture and history. V S Nagendra Prabu, who specializes in foreign tourists, said that he has joined his family members in cultivating paddy on a piece of land in his native Keelanachikulam village. Even with escalating workers’ wage and shortage of employees he is lucky to have something to fall back on. All are not fortunate like him. A Sivagurunathan, president of Tourist Guides Association, Madurai, is now working on a dairy farm as a daily wage worker washing cows and bringing them green fodder. “I count on ration rice and help from relatives to keep the family afloat. I attended a three-day course on livestock farming, but could not set it up as I do not have any land,” he said. He said that many have ventured into trading goods such as pickle and honey for commissions. Some are employed as sales persons in shops for paltry wages. “Tourism industry was the first to be affected by Covid-19 and is expected to be the last to revive. It has already been one year since we lost jobs. As the future is bleak, there is little chance for old guides to return to the profession, even if tourism industry resumes,” he said. Tourist guides are demanding the government to strength the medical facility and promote them outside the country to instil confidence among foreign tourists. They want the vaccination drive to be escalated so that normalcy can return soon. They also sought the state government to introduce tourist friendly autorickshaw and give priority to guides. They should be allowed to carry regular passengers until tourism picks up. Meanwhile, the crowds at election campaigns and festivals without wearing masks or cleaning hands only increases their pain as it would worsen the situation for them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/tour-guides-stare-at-an-uncertain-future/articleshow/81767396.cms||V Devanathan

Majority of those who celebrated the festival of colours at Dewa Sharif were Muslims, who were joined by Hindu disciples of the Sufi saint and dargah priests or ‘sajjada nasheens’. This is an ancient tradition at the Sufi shrine, where the Hindu festival of colours is celebrated with gaiety in the premises of the dargah of a Muslim saint. And devotees from across the country, blurring religious barriers converge here to seek his blessings. Talking to TOI, Sarfaraz Warsi, who’s associated with the dargah, said, “Celebration of Holi at the shrine has been continuing uninterrupted for a century and the custom was being observed since the time of Haji Waris Ali Shah. Round the year, majority of those who visit the dargah are usually Hindus, but during Holi, the ceremony is managed by Muslims and members of the dargah management committee and sajjada nasheens.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/holi-celebrated-with-fervour-at-sufi-shrine-of-waris-shah/articleshow/81768582.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan
---||Delhi||Red Fort case: Bail to senior citizen accused of rioting||NEW DELHI: A senior citizen facing rioting and attempt to murder charges in connection with the farmers’ protest at Red Fort on Republic Day has been granted bail by a city court, which observed that mere presence of the man wasn’t enough to justify his incarceration. The state accused him of violence but additional sessions judge Charu Aggarwal stated: “No active role as instigator or attacker on the police personnel has been assigned to the applicant in the alleged crime.” The counsel appearing for 61-year-old Sukhdev Singh sought his release on the ground that Singh went to Red Fort in the evening and left at around 9.30pm. The counsel also denied Singh being a part of an unlawful assembly that allegedly resorted to violence and destruction of public property. “No active role has been assigned to him in the alleged crime,” it was argued adding that Singh had been in judicial custody from February 7, 2021. The state represented by the prosecutor opposed the bail plea stating that Singh and other protesters had reached Red Fort on January 26 in order to create a new site of protests. However, when the leaders did not turn up, they left the spot. “Applicant was member of unruly mob, which broke all the rules and regulations of protest and damaged the public property,” the state argued. The court observed that the only material evidence against Singh with the prosecution was about him sitting in the protest at Red Fort in the evening. “Mere presence of the applicant at Red Fort in the evening hours cannot justify his further incarceration as he is already in judicial custody from February 7, 2021. Investigation qua him is already completed. He is a senior citizen,” the judge said. Some days ago, Akashpreet Singh had been granted bail in the same case. It was stated that he suffered a firearm wound beside other injuries while performing sewa or service of distribution of water to the people near the scene of incident. It was also argued that Akashpreet suffers from epilepsy. The court had noted that the only evidence against him was his photographs at Red Fort demonstrating him climbing the wall. “Mere presence and climbing on wall by the accused cannot justify his further incarceration,” it held.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/red-fort-case-bail-to-senior-citizen-accused-of-rioting/articleshow/81767407.cms||Aamir Khan
---||Kolkata||Covid spike, test confusion lead to flyer count dip in Kolkata||KOLKATA: The sudden spurt in Covid-19 cases, coupled with confusion over varying Covid test requirements to board flights to various towns and cities, has led to a decline in air travel in the past week. While the airport was recording an average passenger movement of around 44,000 on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays when there is no bar on flights from anywhere, the flyer count on these days has dipped below 39,500 since last week. On the other days, when flights from Chennai, Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur and Ahmedabad are not allowed into Kolkata, the count has declined from around 40,000 to under 36,000. “With Covid-19 cases shooting up in Mumbai and Bengaluru, people have become wary about travelling to these cities and are postponing their trips unless absolutely essential. Cancellations have shot up,” an airline official said. TimesViewAll rules are in place to help us contain the virus’s spread; and it is a given that all rules in place must be followed. But, having said that, it may help if there is some standardisation of rules and rules evolve according to the situation on the ground.For flyers, the varied Covid test requirement from different states has further complicated matters. While the Bengal government had made it mandatory for flyers to get an RT-PCR done prior to travel to the state (Kolkata, Bagdogra or Andal) from Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur, Bengaluru, Hyderabad or Kochi, governments in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Rajasthan and Andaman & Nicobar Islands have also made pre-boarding RT-PCR tests reports mandatory. Also, while all tests have to be conducted within 72 hours prior to boarding while travelling to most cities, the administration in Port Blair has set the time limit for RT-PCR test within 48 hours prior to travel. There have been multiple instances of flyers to Port Blair being denied boarding at the 11th hours as their test reports had overshot the 48-hour mark. On March 26, a well-known cardiologist from Kolkata who was returning to the city after performing surgeries in Bhubaneswar, Hyderabad and Bengaluru, was denied boarding at Bengaluru airport as he did not have a Covid test report. His pleas that he was vaccinated and that he was willing to give an undertaking that he would return to Bengaluru on his own cost if he was denied entry at Kolkata wasn’t accepted by the airline official. “They are doing a thermal scan prior to entering the airport and on arrival. When ministers, bureaucrats and politicians can travel on the basis of a self-declaration, why can’t doctors travelling on work?” he wondered. An official at Kolkata airport said the issue of doing away with Covid tests for vaccinated persons was taken up with the health ministry but the latter had not yet allowed an exception. “We realize that international travel is being allowed on the basis of vaccination certificate but it has not yet been allowed in India,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cov-spike-test-confusion-lead-to-flyer-count-dip/articleshow/81766426.cms||Subhro Niyogi

---||Delhi||Rainbow on the ground: Nature’s palette has bright spring colours for Lutyens’ Delhi||NEW DELHI: Nature’s own street art has turned Lutyens’ Delhi into a riot of colours. Yellow, red, purple, white, blue and gold fringe Shanti Path in Chanakyapuri and go up to Matthew Circle at the Akbar Road-Tughlaq Road junction. And given this is the spring season, of course, the hues dominate Nehru Park, Lodhi Garden and Talkatora Garden too. Pink asters, red and purple petunia, yellow coreopsis, blue salvia and fairy orange marigolds set off by the tiny white blossoms of stock are in full bloom across New Delhi. Also, this year, it is worth watching out for the bright papery hues of bougainvillea at Nehru Park and Children’s Park. The new varieties were brought from Thailand a few years ago and have now started showing off their splendour. The horticulture department of New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) has been careful to ensure that the blooms are all highlighted, none of their beauty obscured by others. So the flowers have been planted not only in rows, but at different heights, affording equal visibility to all. “Multi-colour hollyhock is planted along Kautilya Marg on the boundaries or in the last rows. They are tall plants, with heights of 3-8 feet. Their being at the back helps highlighting their flowers and those in front of them,” said S Chellaiah, director, horticulture, NDMC. “They are looking exceptionally good, even beyond our expectations. In addition, the verbena, linum, dahlia, larkspur, ice plant, dianthus, hybrid pansy and other varieties planted in clumps look very captivating.” At the Children’s Park at India Gate, the bougainvillea plants covering the branches of old trees have turned all pink. There’s not even a hint of green around. “They are mesmerising and people stand for a long time in front of them in admiration,” said Chellaiah. “We have cut the bougainvillea shrubs into shapes of animals and grown creepers and grass around them to add more aesthetics.” NDMC officials earlier feared the blooms would be compromised this year due to the rains in January and the unseasonal rise in temperature from February onward. Indigenous species such as petunia and salvia were affected by the rain. Moreover, around 55,000 bulbs of tulips planted in December did not survive the winters and a new batch had to be planted. Chellaiah said, “January is important for determining the flowering conditions in spring. An appropriate temperature of 5-13 degree Celsius helps proper growth and budding of plants. But this year, there were rains in January and most plants got damaged fully or partially. Then in February, there was a sudden rise in temperature. Not all plants have adapted to these climate changes. But we are thankful we have got good blooms.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rainbow-on-the-ground-natures-palette-has-bright-spring-colours-for-lutyens-delhi/articleshow/81767401.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: School campuses fall silent as students prefer to stay at home||KOLKATA: Forty-five days after school campuses reopened, premises are again wearing a deserted look. Students of classes X and XII are either returning to online doubt-clearing and revision sessions or trying to keep themselves safe before the Board examinations, which are scheduled to start from May 4. The buzz, which had returned to school campuses, has now started to fade. Schools have given session breaks to students of classes IX and XI and suspended offline classes for Board aspirants after completing the pre-Board exams to avoid any Covid-related risk. At St Augustine’s Day School, Ripon Street, students were present regularly and the attendance was around 80%, which rose constantly up to mid-March. “Now, the examinations are over and report cards have been distributed to candidates. At the moment, though we are holding doubt-clearing sessions, the attendance is around 10% to 12% in revision and practical classes. Even during the pre-Board examinations, which were conducted offline, a large section of students had turned out,” said principal Richard Gasper. Several heads of schools pointed out that the recent spurt in Covid cases may have forced parents to take the decision of keeping their wards at home. “The students of classes IX and XI have been given a session break. They will be rejoining the offline classes from April 15. However, we had kept the campus open for students from classes X and XII Board examinees. But, the response has been muted. Considering the upcoming examinations, we have also returned to online teaching for doubt-clearing and revision,” said the head of a Kendriya Vidyalaya. The principal of St James School, TH Ireland, said that considering the quick spread of Covid-19, the school didn’t want to take chances before the Board examinations. “The campus is open for pre-Board exams of classes X and XII, which wil continue till Mar 31. Students of classes IX and IX have gone on session break. After March 31, the Board students, if needed, can contact their teachers for doubt clearance. There will be no on-campus activities after March 31,” Ireland added. Initially, the school reported 65% to 70% attendance when the classes resumed on February 12. Frank Anthony Public School principal Ian Myers said that in the beginning, the school saw 80% to 85% of students between classes IX and XII attend offline sessions. “Now, the campus has fallen silent because classes IX and XI are on session break while the Board candidates are preferring to remain at home considering the spurt in cases. No one wants to take chances,” Myers added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/school-campuses-fall-silent-as-students-prefer-to-stay-at-home/articleshow/81781484.cms||Somdatta Basu

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: No offline semester classes anytime soon, hint colleges||KOLKATA: Several Kolkata colleges and universities have already hinted to their students that a big portion of the odd semesters scheduled to begin in April will be online like the previous semester due to a spike in the number of Covid cases. Experts believe the second wave will ‘peak’ in June. The election results will be out on May 2, after which the next government will take at least a few weeks to take a decision on on-campus classes. Colleges and universities have informed the students of the date of commencement of online classes and have also instructed them to prepare to organize some of the events coming up in the next couple of months online. Presidency University and colleges affiliated to Calcutta University wrapped up their odd semester examinations last week. Students are currently on semester break. Online classes will start in Presidency University from April 2. At JD Birla Institute, online classes resumed earlier this month. Several Calcutta University colleges have informed their students about the date of the commencement of online classes next month. “We are starting online classes from April 5. Since we have not received any instruction from the university to resume on-campus classes, we are starting with online classes,” said Indrila Guha, principal of Basanti Devi College. Principals said they did not want to waste any time to ensure the students do not suffer. “We started the first semester late last year due to the pandemic. As a result, the classes, too, started late. But we do not want to waste any time this time to ensure our students get enough time to complete the syllabus and also revise it,” said Deepali Singhee, principal of JD Birla College where online classes begun earlier this month. Principals and students were expecting on-campus classes might start from the semester due to begin next month. But the sudden spike in Covid cases have dampened their hopes. Medical experts have warned if people don’t follow safety guidelines, the cases might peak in May and June. “We don’t feel that the government will permit to start on-campus classes in this scenario. It would prefer to stick to online classes till the number of cases subside and the vaccination drive makes considerable progress,” said the principal of a south Kolkata college. Election results will come in on May 2 and it will take another few weeks for the new government to take shape and decide on the matter of on-campus classes. “It won’t make sense to resume on-campus classes from mid-June for a few weeks. But we will wait from further instructions from the education department,” said another principal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/no-offline-semester-classes-anytime-soon-hint-colleges/articleshow/81766458.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Hyderabad||I finally rode a bicycle, thanks to my kids||By Debdutta Saha This pandemic has made us all rethink the way we live. Initially, I grappled with managing office, chores and children. The fact that I had to give up my daily routine and get used to a new normal added to my restlessness. I had managed to keep my children away from screens till the pandemic, so all this screen time was another worry that was eating into my patience. I looked at pictures of people world over baking goodies, learning new things and wondered how they managed. The whole world seemed to be on a massive holiday. Gradually, I started accepting things the way they were. Children settled into the new online classroom mode and I began to stop stressing over small things. Every evening we watched a variety of birds fly home forming patterns in the sky. I no more looked at life like a series of check boxes to be ticked off from morning till night. The highlight of the pandemic for me is that I finally learnt how to ride a bicycle. I love sports so am quite active, but the cycle was something that I never had the opportunity to learn. I had this strong feeling of envy, every time I saw people riding their bicycles with the wind on their faces and sunlight streaming through their hair. Now, parents teaching their young children to cycle is a common sight that everyone is familiar with. In my case, it was me on the cycle with my boys, all of 10 and 12 years, supporting me. The fact that the elder boy’s Hindi text book had a hilarious story of a fat, old man who fell a number of times but managed to learn to ride a cycle, made me persist. So, after many such days of struggling for balance, I finally found it. I don’t know who was more shocked and thrilled -- the boys or me -- when I finally peddled my way to independence. It’s been more than a year of work-from-home now, and we have found our groove. The pandemic provided me with an opportunity to learn something that I had always wanted to but could not do earlier. The biggest lesson for me has been that age is just a number, and with the right attitude and determination, achieving anything is possible.

In private hospitals as well, doctors and experts have reported a rising trend in those showing interest in the Covid-19 vaccine. “We are trying to encourage patients if they are eligible to get the Covid-19 vaccine as soon as possible. To minimise any wastage, if we find that some doses of the vaccine are still left after administering to a batch of eligible beneficiaries, we are also trying to provide it to others who may not be eligible at present but are still from vulnerable sections of the society,” said a doctor working at a private hospital. Trichy, standing the sixth place with respect to number of vaccinations provided to beneficiaries, is a part of the top ten districts in the state. According to Trichy district health officials, the vaccination drive is carried in more than 100 places across the district and the public health staff are directly engaged in the vaccination drives in sixty places in the region. Saying that there is no shortage of vaccines in the district as they currently have 15,000 vaccines in reserve, officials added that the next consignment is expected to arrive by the first week of April.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/over-1l-each-in-madurai-trichy-get-covid-jabs/articleshow/81767415.cms||---

Lack of coordination between health authorities of the two districts led to the situation. The woman’s father-in-law Bhupendra Singh told TOI that she was under treatment in a government hospital in Prayagraj and was referred to Lucknow after her condition started deteriorating. “We brought her to the state capital in an ambulance with oxygen support. On the way, we informed the chief medical officer’s office in Prayagraj, which messaged us on phone a PDF of the referral paper raised online and told us that authorities in Lucknow have been informed,” he said. “However, upon reaching the institute, we were told that the referral was not showing on the portal. We contacted Lucknow CMO office again. It said that arrangements are being made, but nothing materialised for three hours. As oxygen in the cylinder was running out, we got her admitted in a private hospital,” he added. Prayagraj CMO Dr Prabhakar Rai said that proper referral was issued and Lucknow authorities were informed in time. However, Lucknow CMO Dr Sanjay Bhatnagar said, “They informed us very late, but still we made arrangements for admission in a private hospital as per availability of beds.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/prayagraj-patient-on-oxygen-support-waits-3-hrs-for-hospital/articleshow/81768626.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Jaipur||Cryptocurrency frauds keep police personnel on their toes||JAIPUR: The investigation into cryptocurrency frauds has become a hard nut for the law enforcement agencies to crack in the city. The first case related to the stealing of bitcoins was registered in 2017 in Jodhpur. The victim is still struggling to trace his coins in want of proper technical investigation. The police department is yet not clear on the standard operating procedures in want of clear guidelines from the centre in its trading. Narendra Gehlot, a businessman based in Jodhpur, filed the first case in Rajasthan of losing 14 Bitcoins which has an estimated value of Rs 6.05crore. “It took 8-9 months for the Mahamandir police station in Jodhpur to understand the case. Fortunately, the accused has been traced and arrested by a cyber expert but the improper police investigation has kept me away from the coins/money till date,” said Gehlot. Similar has been the fate of other cases related to cryptocurrency in the state. The state may have gained expertise in taking information from social media giants — Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp — but no major breakthrough has been made in cases related to cryptocurrency. Also, in the case of Vidit Sharma, who planned a robbery in his own house due to debt in trading in Bitcoin by using unfair means, told the police not being aware of using any illegal means. Digant Anand, DCP (crime), Jaipur police commissionerate, said that this is the latest nature of crime, which requires the highest level of technical expertise. “Solving such cases requires special software, some of which comes at a cost of Rs one crore. Gradually, the department is heading towards the required expertise,” said Anand. He added that those trading in cryptocurrency must educate themselves in the given regulations and rules of the law. Mukesh Choudhary, a cybercrime consultant assisting the Jaipur police commissionerate said that crimes related to cryptocurrency are going to rise since it attracts youths to make quick money. “I find it shocking to see those who suffer any fraud in cryptocurrency don’t have any basic understanding of security features of their cryptocurrency wallets,” said Choudhary, who solved the first cryptocurrency case in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cryptocurrency-frauds-keep-police-personnel-on-their-toes/articleshow/81767524.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Cyclist undergoes spine op after hit and run; no accident footage||MUMBAI: A retired army major who was cycling from south Mumbai to his suburban home suffered grievous injuries in a hit and run on the Western Express Highway (WEH) on Sunday. Joseph Augustine, the 58-year-old victim, suffered a spinal fracture. The police registered a case of rash driving but the culprit remained unidentified even after two days. TimesViewThe accident exemplifies the perils of cycling in Mumbai. Uneven roads, absence of dedicated lanes and high-density traffic makes it dangerous. There is also a general disdain, especially among those driving heavy vehicles, towards those pedalling on arterial roads. In European cities, cycling as a mode of transport is encouraged and bikers enjoy right of way.Joseph’s son, Kevin, said the police informed him that a surveillance camera near the spot in Andheri was not in working order. The police said the camera did not cover the hit-and-run spot. Employed with a bank, Joseph uses a cycle everywhere, even to commute to his Andheri workplace. On weekends, he pedals to Marine Drive. Kevin, also an avid cyclist, said Joseph always used protective cycling gear like a helmet, a reflective vest and flashing lights. On the day of the accident, Joseph left his home in Malad around 5.45am for his usual weekend trip to Marine Drive. While returning, he was hit from behind by a motorist on a flyover in Andheri. As he was thrown off his bicycle, the motorist sped off. “My father was conscious at the time,” Kevin, who works with the merchant navy, said. “Some other cyclists passing by on the stretch stopped to help him and one of them called for an ambulance. My father called me to inform about the crash. He was lying on the flyover when I reached as the ambulance hadn’t arrived. When he was finally wheeled into the Kokilaben Ambani Hospital's ICCU, doctors diagnosed a spinal fracture.” On Monday, Joseph underwent a spinal surgery and remains in the ICCU. “He had been hit on the stretch located right beneath the Mumbai Metro bridge,” Kevin said. “I spotted a surveillance camera and was hopeful the vehicle would have been captured. But at the police station, we were told the camera wasn’t functional.” Kevin put up a series of posts on Twitter to complain about the camera, tagging the city police and minister Aaditya Thackeray. “As cyclists we follow unwritten rules like staying on the leftmost lane, situational awareness and wearing all safety gear,” he said. “What we would like to know is why is a camera at a major highway dysfunctional?” he said in his Twitter posts. Police officials said that they were going through images from other cameras under the bridge. “It's a challenge as Joseph couldn’t see the make of the vehicle nor its colour,” an officer said. “We’ll look for irregular driving patterns.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cyclist-undergoes-spine-op-after-hit-and-run-no-accident-footage/articleshow/81767552.cms||Nitasha Natu
---||Jaipur||Financier’s son had lost money in Bitcoin trading||Jaipur: Twenty-year-old Vidit Sharma who was arrested by police on March 27 for staging robbery in his own house was found to have lost most of his money in Bitcoin trading, forex and IPL betting. He was arrested for conspiring with two college friends to rob Rs 22 lakh so that he could repay a debt of Rs 18 lakh. The other two accused were also arrested and the entire looted amount was recovered on March 28. Vidit staged the robbery and attempted to mislead the police by stating that three ACB sleuths raided the house and took away the cash. His lie was busted by the police within a day. Pursuing graduation from a private college in Jaipur, Vidit was engaged in IPL betting and fantasy online games for the last few years. He has introduced to cryptocurrency trading almost two years ago. Initially, he told the police of having been involved in online gaming. He broke down during interrogation and revealed that he was active in Bitcoin trading through an agent. Sharing his modus operandi, a police officer told TOI that he was basically trading through a Bitcoin wallet linked with somebody’s else bank account. Whenever he converted the BTC to Indian rupee his agent withdrew the amount and provided him with cash. “This form of trading is violating of Indian tax norms. He was making his deals in an unaccounted manner to evade income tax and hiding his trading,” said Mukesh Choudhary, cybercrime consultant at Jaipur Police Commissionerate. Initially, he started with Rs 10,000-Rs 20,000 tradings. Vidit told the police that he had lost Rs 14-15 lakh in Bitcoin trading.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/financiers-son-had-lost-money-in-bitcoin-trading/articleshow/81767608.cms||---

---||Delhi||Wait for possession of 348 DDA flats in Dwarka may be longer||NEW DELHI: Delhi Development Authority’s (DDA) Housing Scheme 2021 had on offer 1,354 flats as the land development agency only kept carefully chosen clusters in ‘sought after’ locations. However, the handover of the most sought after of these all — 348 middle income group (MIG) flats in Dwarka’s Sector 16-B costing Rs 1.2 crore each — has been halted for around five months. DDA conducted the draw for allotment of the flats on March 10 from the total 22,752 applications that were received for the 253 three-bedroom flats, 757 two-bedroom flats, 52 one-bedroom flats and 291 EWS/Janta flats in areas like Dwarka, Jasola, Vasant Kunj etc. While all the flats have been allotted, those who got the 348 two-bedroom flats in Dwarka’s Sector 16-B will have to wait till June to get their demand letters and up to August to get possession of the flats. The reason for the delay is that while the construction of these flats is complete, finishing work remains to make the flats ready-to-move-in. “We didn’t want a condition where allottees may have to wait for the finishing work after completing the formalities and making all payments. That is why demand letters for all flats except these are being issued,” a DDA official said on condition of anonymity. Demand letters will be issued three months before the likely date of possession. Out of the 22,752 applicants, 2,753 people had marked the Dwarka Sector 16-B flats as their first choice. Applicants can mark flats of any category in any particular location as their first choice and then choose second, third or fourth flats in order of priority and choice. Applicants who are successful in the draw of lots, can get a flat of their choice but only if these are available or get the flat marked second, third or further down the priority list till a flat is available.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/wait-for-possession-of-348-dda-flats-in-dwarka-may-be-longer/articleshow/81767634.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Mumbai||Sealed floors up 300% in March; BMC asks hsg societies to self-quarantine too||Mumbai: As Covid-19 cases are rising in the city, so are the number of sealed buildings and floors. Civic data shows there has been a more than 300% rise in the number of sealed floors in the city in a month. While the number of sealed floors as on February 26 stood at 1,849, they now total 7,475. Sealed buildings during the period have increased to 578 from 161. Containment zones in slums and chawls, too, have multiplied to 64 from 12. BMC, though, has said ever since the surge last month, maximum Covid cases are being reported from housing societies. The BMC protocol calls for sealing of an entire building with five or more positive cases and, if fewer, sealing of floors. While many have been complaining that sealing is not being followed and residents of highrises flout quarantine rules, BMC commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal on Tuesday said there is a need for managing committees of housing societies to ensure self-styled sealing. Chahal appealed to managing committees of multi-storeyed buildings to be equally responsible. “Their role is as big as BMC’s in observing certain discipline and ensuring the buildings becomes virus-free by declaring a sort of a self-containment system. Everything cannot be done by policing and this is where I would appeal to every managing committee member of a society to come forward and declare self-styled sealing, so that the virus does not spread. The earlier this is done, the better,” he said. Chahal has also said if citizens do not comply with Covid-19 restrictions, they will be compelled to take tough decisions. Locals have alleged at the ground level, sealing is not being done as it should be and people are seen walking in and out, flouting quarantine norms. In the past, BMC has filed police cases against those violating the norms. This month, BMC filed an FIR against actor Gauhar Khan for flouting the home quarantine norm. On March 9, BMC’s H-West Ward had filed an FIR against a family for allegedly violating the norms and tampering with test reports. Congress corporator Ravi Raja said BMC needs to keep a watch on sealed buildings and floors. “BMC could then request managing committee members to alert them if someone flouts the norms so that action can be taken accordingly. But they cannot put the onus completely on managing committees.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/sealed-floors-up-300-in-march-bmc-asks-hsg-societies-to-self-quarantine-too/articleshow/81767907.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Lucknow||Covid-19: ‘Second wave of pandemic has gripped Lucknow’||LUCKNOW: The rapid rise in Covid-19 cases over the week with infections remaining above 400 in the past three days indicate that the second wave of the pandemic has arrived in the city, say doctors. Holding high complacency in public behaviour that ushered in post January and decline in the herd immunity developed during the peak months of August and September last year responsible for the surge, experts said the cases may touch 1,000 again in the next two weeks if people continue to behave irresponsibly. However, the good part is there are no signs of community spread yet as contact tracing has been able to detect the source of infection. Sample this: From 19 cases on March 14, the single-day count increased to 499 on March 29 — nearly 26-fold rise in 14 days. In fact, the positivity rate — samples found positive in every 100 test — leapt from 0.37 to 1.69 during this period. The positive rate in previous months was 4.9 (October), 3.5 (November), 2.8 (December), 1.5 (January) and 0.3 (February). Prof Anil Kumar Gulati, former head of the microbiology department, IMS BHU, said, “High positivity and rapid increase in cases are clear indicators that the second wave has hit Lucknow.” One of the reasons is that the herd immunity developed among people in the first wave has declined, he added. “This means, a large section of people developed antibodies and generated immunity against the disease after getting exposed to the virus during the peak in August-September. But many among them are asymptomatic. Collectively, it helped in developing the herd immunity in some localities, which checked further transmission of the virus. However, this immunity is now on the decline because antibodies last for just 3 to 4 months, which is making the community vulnerable to reinfection,” he said, while explaining the driving force behind the second wave. Echoing similar views, head, medicine department, KGMU, Prof Virendra Atam said, another big factor is complacency among people that crept in when the cases declined drastically in January. “As people are showing utter disregard to safety protocols, the virus has found a door to walk in again,” he said. “Till 60-70% percent of the population doesn't get vaccinated with two doses, people must follow Covid-19 precautions,” he underlined. CMO Dr Sanjay Bhatnagar also agreed that the second wave has arrived. “We are taking all the measures. 3Ts – test, trace and treatment — are being done on a war-footing, besides strict implementation of containment zones. “On an average, we are testing over 12,000 people daily during contact tracing and random sampling. That’s why cases are being detected easily and numbers are high,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/second-wave-of-pandemic-has-gripped-city/articleshow/81768633.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan
---||Bhopal||Forced to beg, they now cook at police stations||In the three months leading up to the Maha Kumbh, police had rounded up 183 beggars in Haridwar. They soon realised that many had lost their jobs during the pandemic. They came up with a solution. Now trained by a five-star hotel chef, the beggars have been employed as cooks across police stations of Haridwar at a salary of Rs 10,000-12,000, reports MS Nawaz. “I had come to Haridwar from Ranchi (in Jharkhand) a few years ago. I used to work as a daily wager. But when the Covid-19 lockdown came, all work stopped. Even after the lockdown ended, work was hard to come by. I barely had enough to eat in the first few months. I had no choice but to start begging,” Vishu Ram, 56, told TOI. “I had lost my dignity and all hope. I would often think of ending my life.” Madan Mohan, 47, had a similar story. “I suddenly lost my shelter and was forced to live under the open skies. I did not want to beg but what choice did I have?” he told TOI. Vishu and Madan are among the many beggars, between the ages of 30 and 50, who have been engaged as cooks by the police. “With this work, I am leading a respectful life,” said Vishu. In 2017, Uttarakhand had adopted the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Begging Act, 1972 that banned begging. “Generally, when we detain beggars under this Act and then release them, they return and start begging again after a while,” IG Sanjay Gunjyal told TOI. And the pandemic had made things worse. “We wanted to change that.” With the Maha Kumbh approaching — it begins on April 1 — police had been arresting beggars at Har-ki-Pauri Ghat in Haridwar, which draws lakhs during the congregation. “We brought them to beggars’ homes, where they were counselled,” Gunjyal said. There, they learnt that many of them had lost their jobs when Covid-19 hit, started begging and never recovered. “After several sessions of speaking to them and motivating them, some 30 of them came forward to seek work. Eventually, many from that group were picked for the training.” Sixteen beggars, as of now — from Uttarakhand, UP, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Maharashtra — were then signed up for training under a chef from a five-star hotel in Haridwar. After their training, they were engaged as cooks at police stations that are overseeing the Maha Kumbh. They are paid Rs 10,000-12,000 a month. “The money goes straight into their bank accounts, which we opened for them,” Gunjyal said. But what happens after the Maha Kumbh ends? Police have a plan. Gunjyal said, “After the congregation is over, we will get them work. We must end this cycle of destitution.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/forced-to-beg-they-now-cook-at-police-stations/articleshow/81769941.cms||---

The NCB also carried out a search of Khan’s residence in Yari Road, Andheri, from where it recovered some tablets that it suspects are banned and which fall under the ambit of the NDPS Act. Khan was detained by the NCB after he arrived from Jaipur at the domestic airport in the afternoon. Khan has worked in several Hindi and Telugu films. He had also participated in Khatron Ke Khiladi 5. On Bigg Boss 7, the actor was the second runner-up. Khan’s name cropped up after the NCB on Thursday arrested two persons, Shadab Shaikh alias Farooq Batata and his mentor Shahrukh alias Bullet, from whom they recovered large quantities of drugs, cash and high-end cars. An NCB team led by zonal director Sameer Wankhede had raided a Kasam Nagar Chawl near Laxmi Industrial Estate in Andheri on Thursday night. During the raid, the team also searched the slum tenement of Shahrukh, who was known to lead a lavish life. The search of his dwelling resulted in the recovery of 2 kg of mephedrone, cash of Rs 1.15 lakh, foreign currency, which included Iranian rials, Polish zloty & Omani rial, a Toyota Fortuner and a Hyundai i20, and a currency note counting machine. Shahrukh was arrested from his hiding place on the mezzanine floor. His interrogation led the NCB to his Shaikh’s residence in Lokhandwala, Oshiwara, from where it recovered 61 grams of mephedrone, 160 grams of ephedrine. “During Batata and Bullet’s interrogation Ejaz Khan’s name cropped up. We have also found some incriminating documents and evidence of Khan’s involvement. We are still questioning him and the picture will be clear on Wednesday,” an official said. Khan had been arrested in 2018 for uploading an objectionable post on the social networking site Facebook. In 2018 he was arrested by the Thane Anti-Narcotic Cell for possession of drugs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/now-ejaz-khan-detained-in-a-drug-syndicate-case-in-mumbai/articleshow/81767622.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Mumbai||BMC cuts off sewage lines of tax defaulters in Mumbai||Mumbai: Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Tuesday disconnected sewage lines of four properties of owners who have defaulted on paying property tax. BMC usually disconnects water lines of buildings owned by property tax defaulters. BMC officials said that dues of around Rs 8.7 crore were pending of a hotel in K-West ward. “Despite repeated requests and notices, the property tax was not paid,” said a civic official. In 2020-21, BMC had set a target to collect property tax of Rs 5,200 crore, but has so far collected Rs 4,536 crore. It had in February begun attaching properties of defaulters. Officials said that it was part of a drive to recover property tax from violators. It has also begun auctioning properties of property tax defaulters. BMC has outstanding property tax of close to Rs 20,000 crore. With the civic body facing a severe cash crunch this year due to Covid-19 pandemic, and a slew of discounts to builders and contractors, it began to attach and auction properties of property tax defaulters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bmc-cuts-off-sewage-lines-of-tax-defaulters-in-mumbai/articleshow/81768697.cms||---

---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: Frantic firefight on to save ancient Jain temple from jungle blaze||BARWANI: A desperate firefight is on to save the 12th Century Digambar Jain Siddha Khshetra of Bawan Gaja from a forest blaze in the Satpura mountains in Madhya Pradesh. The historic pilgrimage site – with an imposing 84-ft-tall statue of Lord Adinath -- is 8km from the district headquarters of Barwani and 155km from Indore. Barwani divisional forest officer (DFO) Dr. Anupam Sahay told TOI that the fire is about 2km by aerial distance from Bawan Gaja but will be controlled by Tuesday night. Sahay told TOI that there was a bush fire in the hills in Bawangaja area two days ago, which was controlled after a few hours. Early Tuesday, it flared up again, possibly because of a carelessly thrown beedi, and swept through more than 5 hectares of forest and revenue area, say officials. “There are shrubs and grasses on these mountains but due to the strong winds, it is becoming difficult to control the fire. Fire tenders have been called from Barwani and other places but due to the difficult terrain, the going is tough,” the DFO said. The roads between the hills and the statue of Bawangaja are being continually sprayed with water so that the fire is checked. “There is currently no threat to the temples of Bawangaja and the statue of lord Adinath,” the DFO said. “Everything is being done to control the fire with the help of villagers and forest staff and we will overcome it late tonight,” Sahay said, adding that strong winds are making the firefight difficult. The magnificent idol of Lord Adinath in Chulgiri Siddha Kshetra was chiseled from a single block of brown stone on a hill.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/frantic-firefight-on-to-save-ancient-jain-temple-from-jungle-blaze/articleshow/81767615.cms||Animesh Jain

---||Kolkata||Shoddy repairs turn roads into death traps in Kolkata||KOLKATA: Shoddy work on roads dug up to repair underground utilities have turned into a nightmare for motorists and death trap for bikers. Stretches of Harish Mukherjee Road that were dug up to repair leakages in the underground water pipelines two weeks ago are yet to be properly restored. The hurried repair job has left the section so bumpy and difficult to negotiate that it is slowing down traffic and leading to snarls. Similarly, stretches of Asutosh Mukherjee Road and Elgin Road that were also dug up to repair water pipes have left two-wheelers in peril. According to a KMC water supply department official the civic body had decided to conduct a thorough search for leakages in the underground water pipes in Harish Mukherjee Road and Bhowanipore following contamination of drinking water in some areas. Apart from Bhowanipore and Harish Mukherjee Road, large stretches of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Road (Tollygunge) were dug up to check the condition of the water pipelines and take necessary repair work before the peak of summer when demand for potable water soars. However, several stretches of the 5-km long road are awaiting a proper repair. Even those stretches like the one near Ashoknagar Park or Malancha cinema where repair attempts were made, the condition didn’t improve causing much inconvenience to motorists and bikers. “Even if the KMC had to dig roads to repair underground water pipes, the area should have been restored properly and in time. First, they dug large stretches of NSC Bose Road. Even after repairing leakages in the pipelines, the civic body left the road dug-up for days without trying to restore it. When they at all did repair, it was in an improper manner that has left the surface uneven. I find it difficult to drive through stretches during rush hours and often get late for office,” said banker Nirmal Chatterjee a resident of Moore Avenue. According to a KMC water supply department senior official, after completing the repairing of underground water main pipes, the department normally informs either the civic body’s roads department or civic engineering department which takes up the restoration work. “If we need to take up a fresh restoration process in some stretches, we may have to instruct the borough officials,” a KMC roads department official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/shoddy-repairs-turn-roads-into-death-traps/articleshow/81766630.cms||Saikat Ray

---||Kolkata||Three from a family, two friends injured in clashes||Kolkata: Kolkata witnessed clashes between Trinamool and BJP in at least four different places. In two incidents in north Kolkata, a father-son duo and two friends had to be hospitalized after they were beaten up. In the first incident, Dum Dum Road resident Sandip Dasgupta was returning home on a cycle on Holi day. According to his brother, Surajit Dasgupta, some residents of the area, who were dancing on the road in the Sinthee area, stopped Sandip and asked him to join. When he refused, he was allegedly assaulted. Sandip called up his brother for help. Surajit and his daughter, who reached the spot on a bike, were also allegedly assaulted. “We are BJP supporters and they had asked us to dance to a Trinamool song. We were attacked for refusing to dance,” he said. Former Trinamool councillor Santanu Sen rubbished the claim. “It was a dispute between members of a local club and a family. BJP is trying to politicize the matter for ulterior motives,” said Sen. In the second incident in north Kolkata, a complaint was lodged by a Rabindra Sarani resident, Samar Panja (38), who claimed at least five Trinamool supporters attacked him on the day of Holi, telling him not to vote for BJP. Panja claimed his friend, Manas Chakraborty, was also assaulted. Trinamool denied the claim, saying an internal clash between locals was being given a political colour. A day earlier, in the same area, Trinamool workers allegedly restrained Abhishek Roy, booth president of BJP. Other party members were assaulted and allegedly threatened not to work for BJP. At Mullik Bazar, BJP’s Ballygunge candidate Loknath Chatterjee claimed he and his party members were attacked by Trinamool workers. Chatterjee claimed he had offered puja at a temple and was coming out when dozens of men zeroed in on him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/three-from-a-family-two-friends-injured-in-clashes/articleshow/81766665.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The assets included 14 bank accounts with a balance of Rs 1.10 crore and immovable assets worth Rs 7.08 crore including residential and commercial buildings in Jaipur and Udaipur. The ED had initiated a probe under Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) based on multiple FIRs registered by Rajasthan Police against one Arun Kumar Agrawal his associated firm, companies and persons. Agrawal with collusion of other persons and family members had allegedly conspired to float a firm wherein the general public was asked to invest with the promise that they would be given benefits at interest rates of 9% to 18 % and sometimes even 24% per annum payable on monthly basis. “Information from different banks, registration authorities, Income Tax department, police and RTO etc revealed that funding to the said companies were made from the bank accounts of M/s Vaibhav Enterprises and most of said companies started to disguise the investors to show the various business. However, most of the firms were loss-making and no actual work were being done there. “It was also found that investors’ money was used for the personal purposes by purchasing luxurious cars, jewellery, foreign tours, business of beauty parlour and to maintain luxurious lifestyle,” the officer added. Further investigation in the case was on, they added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ed-attaches-rs-8cr-assets-of-bizman/articleshow/81767627.cms||---

The deceased was identified as Paras (19) aka Saroj of Patauna village in the area. His father Panna Lal accused fair price shop owner Mool Chand and his son Dharmveer of the same village of killing his son and named them as accused in his complaint. He said his son Paras had a dispute with Mool Chand a year ago on ration disbursal from a fair price shop and had threatened to file a complaint against him. “Saroj was going to the field with his cousin Rahul when Mool Chand and his son Dharmveer intercepted him. They attacked Saroj with an iron rod. The attackers then gouged out Saroj’s eye and fled.” Saroj was rushed to CHC from where he was referred to KGMU Trauma Centre where he died,” said SHO Maal, Ram Singh. Panna Lal told police Saroj had a verbal spat with Mool Chand a year ago when the latter refused to give him ration. “Saroj was working in the field and had reached the shop late.

---||Mumbai||Will run 60,000 Covid tests/day to flush out virus, says Chahal||Mumbai: The BMC wants to flush out the coronavirus by conducting the maximum number of tests per day and isolating positive persons, municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal said on Tuesday after receiving the first dose of the Covid vaccine at the BKC jumbo facility.The maximum tests conducted so far in one day are 48,057, and Chahal said by early next week, the plan is to crank it up to 60,000 a day.Chahal explained increased testing would automatically mean more cases, but it is needed to take out the positive cases and isolate them so that the chain of spread can be broken.“The positive numbers, whether 6,000 or more, are immaterial as long as the mortality is under control and every needy person is getting a hospital bed… Hence we are not shying away from conducting tests and plan to touch 60,000 a day. I will make it in the coming Tuesday-Wednesday. I would even be happier to go beyond that as well. Currently, the city is conducting close to 50,000 tests a day for the past 4-5 days,” said Chahal, adding that this may lead to the number of positive cases going to 9,000-10,000 per day. But this would not be a cause for worry as many may be asymptomatic.The civic chief stressed on Covid-appropriate behavior. “In Mumbai, 2.4 million have been fined for not wearing masks and Rs 48 crore have been collected...Due to this, even if people may not be wearing masks properly, everyone is with masks now. My further appeal to citizens is they should show Covid-appropriate behaviour by putting on their masks properly and ensure there is no crowding,” said Chahal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/will-run-60000-covid-tests/day-to-flush-out-virus-says-chahal/articleshow/81768576.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Goa||No curbs for tourists, no strict SOPs for them: Michael Lobo||PORVORIM: Even as photos of tourism at full swing with blatant violation of Covid norms went viral on social media, eliciting angry reactions from citizens, ports minister Michael Lobo said on Tuesday that enforcing health protocols would deter tourists from coming to Goa. He said that Section 144 didn’t apply to tourists. “If you make SOPs stricter and you harass tourists, which tourist will come to Goa? We have to take precautionary measures, but at the same time, you cannot stop business because Covid-19 cases are increasing,” Lobo said. Lobo was asked why the state was not cracking down on tourists, particularly customers outside offshore casinos who were not wearing masks and standing in large groups. “We cannot put stricter SOPs or curtail them from coming to Goa,” he told reporters outside the assembly complex. “If the state is getting GST today, it is because tourists are in Goa. If we get stricter than this, you will see the decline in the tourism belt. Tourists coming to Goa will decline.” The minister, who had opposed a move to make Covid-negative certificates mandatory for tourists, said that Goa’s economy survives on tourism. He said that the curbs introduced recently through the imposition of Section 144 had “nothing to do with tourism or to stop the tourists” who flocked to the state to celebrate Holi. “Section 144 is not for them,” he said. “If by bringing in strong SOPs we stop these tourists from coming, youth who are currently employed will be stuck at home. Who will pay their salaries? Then, along with the Covid pandemic, the employment crisis will start.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-curbs-for-tourists-no-strict-sops-for-them-lobo/articleshow/81768701.cms||---

The gang included a woman who used to send friend requests to strangers and after becoming friends, she used to invite these people where along with her aides they used to rob people. Police on Monday arrested a young woman and her two aides in this connection. “One Deepak Goswami had lodged a case at Harmara police station on March 29 saying that a day earlier he got a message from one Neetu Sharma on an app installed on his mobile. After accepting the friend request, the victim started chatting with the woman. Thereafter, a woman met him at road No. 14, Sikar Road. But the woman said she was Neetu’s sister and asked him to go at another place to meet Neetu. When they moved to the location suggested by the woman, a couple of men looted cash and other valuables,” said DCP (west) Pradeep Mohan Sharma said. Soon after lodging of FIR, police saw CCTV camera footage of the locations suggested by the victim. “It was found that the girl identified as Jyoti Kumawat had maintained a fake ID as Neetu Sharma on a social networking app. After getting a friend request approved, she used to influence people and invite them at various locations. Thereafter, with the help of her aides, they used to rob them,” Sharma added. The arrested accused were identified as Jyoti Kumawat (28), wife of Nathuram and a resident of Ringas and Junior Kumawat (21) and Rahul Bairwa (20), both residents of Harmara.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/police-bust-gang-of-robbers-arrest-3-including-woman/articleshow/81767629.cms||---

All members of Yadav’s family were celebrating the festival together after 16 years. Due to Covid-19, the family, however, remained indoors and relived memories of the festival. “We have a joint family of 14 members including us five cousins. For higher education and jobs, we had all left Lucknow very early on. Every Holi, someone would be missing from the celebrations. However, this year, we all were together. It was an emotional and overwhelming day. We couldn’t celebrate like before but the festival brought all of us together,” added Yadav. Holi was a subdued one for all Lucknow residents who marked the day with intimate family gatherings and low-key parties at home. Alambagh resident Komal Vaid too celebrated the festival after four years with close relatives. “We celebrated a grand Holi after four years as all our relatives had gathered in our home, making it a group of 30 people. We played songs, danced, smeared colours and used water guns at each other,” said Vaid. For many, Covid-19 protocols meant changing traditions of previous years. Om Tripathi of Gomtinagar said, “Every year we used to gather in huge numbers at a park in Vipul Khand. But this year, we maintained safe distance and only met close friends in the evening to exchange greetings and gujhiya.” “This year, there were no songs playing or water tanks kept in our society but my friends smeared colour at each other and children stepped out with water guns,” said Aradhna Mishra, another resident. “I went only to one friend’s house around 10am and played Holi with dry gulal. This festival is about meeting close friends and colouring their faces so it felt good despite restrictions,” added Rajiv Verma of Indiranagar. Temples maintain rituals: City temples like Iskcon and Khatu Shyam temple observed ‘phoolon ki Holi’. Following the age-old tradition started by veteran politician Lalji Tandon in Chowk of taking out a procession on Holi, the Holika Utsav Samiti took out a mini-procession around Old City to observe the festival.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/many-home-after-years-on-holi-due-to-pandemic/articleshow/81768739.cms||Aditi Singh

---||Mumbai||Khar murder chargesheet: ‘Accused didn’t react when I said friend dead’ in Mumbai||Mumbai: Yash Ahuja, who threw the New Year party in Khar during which 19-year-old psychology student Jhanvi Kukreja was found dead, has told cops that when he had called accused Shree Jogdhankar, who was a close friend of Kukreja, to say her body had been found on the ground floor, he did not react. This led him to suspect that Jogdhankar, 22, already knew about Kukreja’s death.This statement is part of the nearly 500-page chargesheet submitted by Khar police before the Bandra magistrate’s court, accusing Jogdhankar and Diya Padalkar, 18, both close friends of Kukreja, of murder and abetment under IPC. There are no eye-witnesses, but police said they have strong circumstantial, forensic and technical evidence. Statements of 74 witnesses, including friends of the trio at the party and the Bhagwati Heights building residents, are part of the chargesheet.Among the medical evidence is a report that says Kukreja suffered 48 injuries from head to toe and a majority of them were grave. Forensic reports showed blood samples collected from the crime spot, found on Jogdhankar’s shirt, and on the bed where Padalkar slept after the incident matched Kukreja’s. Padalkar claims she suffered a cut on her lips after she fell, while Jogdhankar said he was attacked by assailants who wanted to kill him.The police case is that the trio left the party on the eighth floor by stairs around 1.45am on January 1, 2021. They had a fight and the accused assaulted Kukreja and dragged her down the stairs from the fifth floor to the second floor, where clumps of hair were found in the grille. “A trail of blood stains was found starting from the fifth floor while the murder occurred on the second floor. Kukreja’s body was found at the end of the staircase on the ground floor.”One of Jogdhankar’s friends said he had come to his house that night with injuries. They took him to Sion hospital. Later, at his house, Jogdhankar got a call about a friend being admitted to hospital. He borrowed clothes, changed and left.Witnesses from the party told cops they saw Jogdhankar getting intimate with Kukreja. A few others said he was seen getting close to Padalkar. A college friend of Kukreja said she had called her at 1.32am and began crying. “You know Shree and I are very close friends. But Padalkar was getting physically close with Shree and I didn’t like it. I don’t want to lose either of them.”Ahuja also told cops that when he went to his flat at around 2.15am to get biryani, he saw Padalkar lying in bed.

For the first time in Goa, a software driven system that controls the access to some of the state’s antiques has been installed at the directorate of archaeology. The system operates somewhat like a vending machine wherein the user can select the item of their choice on a touchscreen and the system generates the antique for viewing. “The introduction of this technology will open a new era of preservation strategies for artefacts. There is a need to use advanced technologies for the management and maintenance of heritage,” said deputy chief minister, Chandrakant Kavlekar while inaugurating the technology. “We also have archives that date back to almost 500 years and efforts are in process to digitise them for which provision is being made in this year’s budget.” Installation of the technology cost Rs 27 lakh and the machine holds a total of 83 items so far. There are eight trays in the system and the capacity of each tray is 350 kgs. Besides keeping an inventory of the antiquities, the system also provides access to information about the antiques like its age, material it’s made of and the place where it was salvaged from. This automated storage and locking system also ensures the security of the antiques. The technology of accessed control, secure environment control and software approach of the machine is a first for antiques. Until now, this machine has been used only for the storage of industrial equipment. “All this while, information was stored manually by the department. With the help of this software, there is a digital record and since it is easy to search in this machine, there are no chances of misplacement of objects,” said the contractor, Sailendra Phatak of I-Tech Business Solutions, Pune.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/now-antiques-of-archaeology-dept-are-barely-a-click-away/articleshow/81768706.cms||Nida Sayed
---||India||SC finds UP order on life convicts ‘laughable’||NEW DELHI: Terming as “laughable” the Uttar Pradesh government’s decision to reject remission of sentence of three life convicts on grounds that included their “socio economic status not being appropriate”, the Supreme Court has granted the three interim bail to enable them to come out of jail after nearly 16 years. A bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and R Subhash Reddy pulled up the state authorities for rejecting the convicts’ remission plea “without applying mind” and said it was done to just to prevent them from coming out of jail. Additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati, appearing for the state, agreed to reconsider the application. “It troubles us when the state behaves like this. They are in jail for the last 16 years without parole. If the government has devised the policy then it should be implemented in true spirit,” the bench said and directed the state to reconsider their plea. Times ViewDenying Granting it parole to life is convicts a nuanced on the affair sort . But of grounds proffered by the UP government here does not befit a modern government. It is not just inhumane, it smacks of class-bias. The SC has rightly raised a concern about such attitudes.Referring to the order passed by a joint secretary declining the request for release of the prisoners on various grounds, including refusal to give an undertaking and their socio-economic status not being appropriate, the bench said, “We are appalled to read the order passed.... We are of the view that the officer concerned possibly does not even understand the contours of what is required to be considered before deciding such an application.” "We have found the consideration laughable as the question of petitioners being involved in any other crime did not arise as they have been in custody without parole for 16 years. If wrong material is placed before the competent authority, the result will naturally be not correct. It thus appears to us that the police authorities are somehow or the other preventing the release now as a matter of some kind of prestige, their conduct having been commented upon in an adverse way by this court," the bench said. “We have also perused the information report/recommendation of the DM which appears to us a mere formality rather than a serious consideration. We would have thought that police will do some introspection but it does show only an obdurateness,” the court said while noting that it had also earlier asked the authority to reconsider their remission plea. The court granted the state four weeks’ time to do the needful on the remission plea of the convicts who were awarded life imprisonment in a murder case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-finds-up-order-on-life-convicts-laughable/articleshow/81769976.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

Unlike in the pre-Covid years when the celebrations were lavish and boisterous, this year the organisers — departments of tourism and art and culture — slimmed down the cultural festivities to two exhibitions – ‘Sono Rajasthan’ and ‘Vihangam’ at Jawahar Kala Kendra, showcasing the treasure-trove of art, culture and heritage of the state. Prime Minister Narendra Modi also used the occasion to greet the people of Rajasthan on its statehood day. “Many wishes on Statehood Day to all the brothers and sisters of Rajasthan, known for their rich culture and rich heritage,” the PM tweeted in Hindi. At a seminar organized to mark the event, Mugdha Sinha, secretary, art and cultre said, “Owing to the Covid pandemic, the ‘Rajasthan Diwas’ celebration has been kept small adhering to all Covid guidelines. The lockdown made us realize the importance of art when we were all thirsting for it. To promote art, we all must work together.” During the seminar, tourism director Nishant Jain said, “Art, culture and literature must all co-exist together, without which it is like an animal not having a tail. Tourism and art both bring joy, colour and happiness in one’s life. Generally, many think art is paintings and music. But it is much more diverse like the making of lac bangles, puppetry, blue pottery and much more.” In the ‘Sono Rajasthan’ exhibition, contemporary and modern artworks of renowned artists of the state were displayed which ranged from paintings, sculptures, and installations. Curated by Vidhyasagar Upadhyay, it showcased artworks by 106 artists. Curated by poet and artist Rajesh Kumar Vyas, ‘Vihangam’ was a photographic narrative of landscapes and portraits capturing the diverse facets of Rajasthan. On this day, visitors to museums and monuments were given free entry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rajasthan-day-celebrated-minus-glitz-fanfare-of-pre-covid-years/articleshow/81767655.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

These prisoners mainly include those who have completed 14 years of actual imprisonment and earned a minimum of 2.5years of remission. Chief minister Ashok Gehlot made the decision following recommendations by Rajeev Dasot, director-general, prisons. “This announcement is a historic one which will go a long way towards correctional and rehabilitative approach being adopted by CM Ashok Gehlot,” said Dasot. Maximum prisoners were freed from Jaipur division (516), Bikaner (322), Jodhpur (152), Bharatpur (109), Udaipur (96), Kota (87) and Ajmer (67). Sunil (40), one of the beneficiaries of the scheme, said that he went to jail at an early age. He was scared initially but it has contributed to completing his education—B.Com and M.Com. “It is not a prison but a correctional home in the true sense. I was taken care of by the prison staff and was always encouraged to enhance my education and skills. I am heading out of the prison with confidence to rebuild my life,” said Sunil, who was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder. As per the state law, the inmates after serving a stipulated period of their sentence with good behaviour are entitled to certain remissions.

He said these institutions were now as good as private banks and going after big defaulters. He said: “Out of Rs 400 crore loan that the last Akali government had taken for running the Atta Dal scheme through Markfed and Punsup, the Captain Amarinder Singh government had repaid Rs 380 crore. Co-operative banks are the banks of the people, and being the watchdog of these institutions, we have unearthed embezzlement cases and taken action against the defaulting borrowers.” The minister said the government will improve the online infrastructure of the co-operative banks by unifying all the 802 branches, for which request had been made to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). This will allow inter-district transaction.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/going-after-loan-defaulters-min/articleshow/81767653.cms||---

Hospital sources said he was stable and recovering, but the surgery could be postponed by days to a couple of weeks. Party spokesperson Nawab Malik on Tuesday said in social media that Pawar had to be hospitalised a day before his scheduled surgery due to abdominal pain. Pawar (80) was diagnosed with a gallbladder-related problem on Sunday when he was rushed for an emergency checkup to Breach Candy Hospital. A day later, Malik tweeted that Pawar would get admitted on Wednesday for endoscopy and surgery. Pawar, a cancer survivor, was asked to stay off blood-thinners ahead of the surgery. On Tuesday, though, he was rushed back to the hospital due to the pain. “Attention please, our party president Sharad Pawar saheb was supposed to be admitted in hospital for endoscopy and surgery procedure tomorrow, but since he is experiencing some pain again in the abdomen, he is admitted in Breach Candy Hospital in Mumbai today,” Malik tweeted on Tuesday. In a video statement, he said the future course of action and operation schedule would be decided by the concerned doctors. Pawar was detected with gallstones following an endoscopy. Gallstones are stone-like objects often made of cholesterol or bilirubin that can develop in the gallbladder or bile ducts and cause pain. Treatment options can involve minimally invasive surgery to remove the gallstones. A hospital source said, “A decision on the treatment will be taken in due course”.

---||Goa||Elections to five civic bodies on April 23, result three days later||Panaji: The Goa state election commission (SEC) on Tuesday announced April 23 as polling date for five municipalities of Margao, Mormugao, Mapusa, Sanguem and Quepem and over 1.8 lakh citizens will cast their votes. The counting of votes will be held on April 26. The SEC said that filing of nominations will begin from March 31 to April 8, except on April 2 (Good Friday) and April 4 which is a Sunday. Scrutiny would be conducted on April 9 and withdrawal of nominations on April 10, after which on the same day the list of candidates would be declared. Byelection to one ward each of two village panchayats have also been scheduled along with the municipal polls. In the recently concluded election of seven urban local bodies (ULBs), BJP swept six ULBs, including the Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP). A political observer stated that BJP would leave no stone unturned to continue with its performance, while opposition will try all possible tactics to stop the BJP from taking hold of these municipalities. Out of the five civic bodies, except for Margao and Sanguem, the other three are represented by BJP MLAs. As per the Supreme Court order, the SEC has to complete the poll process by April 30. Speaking to reporters, state election commissioner W V Ramanamurthy said, “The model code of conduct is in force with immediate effect only in the areas under the jurisdiction of the respective municipal councils.” It may be recalled that in February, the SEC had announced civic elections to 11 municipalities on March 20, however, the date was later changed to March 21 after the Supreme Court stayed the high court order cancelling elections to five municipalities over reservation of wards. Ramananmurthy said that there are 18 sensitive polling booths in Mormugao municipality, while there are none in the other municipalities. Regarding Covid-19 positive patients, Ramananmurthy said that they are entitled to cast their vote during the last hour of election, between 4 pm and 5pm, for which standard operation procedures (SOPs) have been issued. “The sector magistrate and flying squad will monitor any kind of violence or any kind of issues during election,” the SEC stated, while adding that while campaigning, candidates will have to adhere to the Covid precaution guidelines and as well as election rules. When asked if Section 144 issued by the district magistrate would clash with the poll campaign, the chief election commissioner said that he will deliberate on this issue with the district magistrate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/elections-to-five-civic-bodies-on-april-23-result-three-days-later/articleshow/81768772.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Budget session adjourned, to resume on July 19||PORVORIM: The ongoing session of the Goa legislative assembly was cut short by over two weeks and adjourned till July 19 after the state election commission (SEC) declared the schedule for the second phase of the municipal elections, bringing into force the model code of conduct. All pending business of the house which was listed for the coming days, including the discussion on the budgetary demands and the private member’s bills submitted by the opposition, will be taken up for discussion and consideration in July, after the session resumes. The decision to adjourn the budget assembly session was taken at the meeting of the business advisory committee (BAC) in the afternoon, said speaker Rajesh Patnekar. In doing so, the state government appears to have grudgingly accepted the opposition’s demand for the house to be adjourned till the civic polls are over. While the opposition had recommended that the sitting of the house resumes after the results, the government has considered “its own convenience” and taken a three-and-a-half month break. As per the schedule announced by the SEC, the elections for the five municipal councils will be held on April 23 and the results will be declared on April 26. The assembly session was supposed to go on till April 16. On March 17, Congress, Goa Forward Party, MGP and NCP had urged the BAC to break the budget assembly session and seek a vote on account instead of presenting the full budget. Anticipating that the elections for the five municipal councils would be announced during the session, a united opposition had not only urged Patnekar to break the assembly session but also met governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari, asking him to direct chief minister Pramod Sawant to seek a vote on account. Sawant ignored the suggestion at the time. On Tuesday, the SEC announced the schedule for the municipal election. Based on this, an urgent BAC meeting was convened to discuss the situation. “The BAC met and during the meeting, the government said that the session is being curtailed because the model code of conduct is in force. They also said ‘prevailing circumstances’ which could be anything, including the pandemic,” said GFP president and MLA Vijai Sardesai. While the opposition said that the decision to break the assembly session was right, they also said that the government took the step to avoid the questions being raised by the opposition in the assembly. “The way things are going on in the assembly, the government is a little nervous about continuing the session. They are finding it difficult to answer questions,” said opposition leader and Congress MLA Digambar Kamat. Patnekar was forced to adjourn the house twice on two separate days after opposition MLAs protested and rushed into the well of the House. On Tuesday, the opposition alleged that the coal block allocation process was a scam in the making, and that the government wanted to avoid a discussion on the issue. Sardesai said that the budget presented by Sawant raised more questions than answers about the BJP-led government’s vision. During the current session, the CM presented the budget for 2021-22 on March 24, days after the BJP swept the first phase of the municipal polls. “We don’t know what is the intention of this government. The adjournment also gives the government an escape, a sort of relief as they were being exposed in the House,” said Sardesai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/budget-session-adjourned-to-resume-on-jul-19/articleshow/81768741.cms||---

The committee was constituted on Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s directive, It comprised director general, fire, RK Vishwakarma; principal secretary, medical education, Alok Kumar, and Kanpur divisional commissioner Raj Shekhar. Vishwakarma told TOI that they have recommended structural changes in the LPS hospital building to prevent such mishaps in the future. “The enhancement of the hospital’s bed strength from 40 to 150 was found to be alarming and needs immediate attention. Proper spacing has to be made for operating such capacity of beds,” he said. Vishwakarma said that air-conditioning needs improvement in the building. “There must be compartmentalised air-conditioning in such buildings. But the building has central air-conditioning, as a result of which it is locked from all the sides not allowing smoke to pass,” he added. The breadth of staircases in the building also does not seem to be fit in the building and it should be at least one meter wide, the officer said. Vishwakarma said that presence of a storeroom near the surgery sections should be avoided. Such pattern is becoming common in new hospitals and poses risk of fire break out. “Due to the presence of a store room in KGMU hospital in Lucknow a similar fire was caused in 2018,” he added. The fire in theLPS Institute of Cardiology was caused by a short-circuit in the hospital’s store room located on the ground-floor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/kanpur-fire-panel-suggests-structural-changes-in-hosp-bldg/articleshow/81768806.cms||---

---||Lucknow||March feels like May, mercury soars to 40||Lucknow: The city recorded its second hottest day in 48 years in the month of March on Tuesday. The state capital was also lashed by the dry hot winds — typically witnessed in mid-April. Both indicated early onset of summer which could be harsh this year. On Tuesday, maximum and minimum temperatures soared to 40.4 and 20.2 degrees Celsius, 5.4 and 2.7 units above normal. Monday, too, had witnessed 3-4 degrees above normal temperatures. State Met director JP Gupta said the flow of cool air from the hills was cut off by a western disturbance. Bright sunshine due to clear sky added to the heat. “The WD will fizzle out on Wednesday, resuming the flow of cool air. It will mix with the high velocity currently lashing the city and bring mercury down by some degrees, but hot conditions will continue. This was the fourth extreme weather condition witnessed in Lucknow this year so far. The incidence of such conditions has increased in the past decade. For instance, among the top five hottest March days, three occurred in the past 11 years. This, said weather experts, could be due to climate change.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/march-feels-like-may-mercury-soars-to-40/articleshow/81768835.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ahmedabad||Stay lifted, report on fires submitted||Ahmedabad: The Justice (retd) D A Mehta commission on Tuesday submitted to the state government its inquiry report on the fires at two Covid-19 hospitals: Shrey Hospital in Ahmedabad and Uday Shivanand Hospital in Rajkot. The government is expected to table the report in the assembly on Wednesday. The probe panel submitted its report to the chief minister on the day the division bench of Gujarat high court lifted a stay by a single judge on the submission of the report. The stay on submission was ordered on March 19 by the HC in response to a petition filed by the kin of the victims of the Shrey Hospital fire, who expressed apprehensions about the quick submission of the report by the probe panel without giving them an opportunity to cross-examine other witnesses. The state government challenged the stay order by filing an appeal. The division bench of Chief Justice Vikram Nath and Justice Bhargav Karia concluded that the appeal was maintainable and the single judge erred by staying the submission of the probe panel’s report. The division bench considered that the inquiry commission had a tenure up to March 31. Against the arguments of the hurried manner as forwarded by the petitioner, the bench said, “For the state as also the commission, it is a race against time. In matters of such statutory public inquiries, time is of the essence.” The court held that both the government and commission were under the scanner of the Supreme Court to ensure that the report is submitted in time. The HC further said, “Timely ascertainment of the truth is a part of the process of delivery of justice and is an important component for granting closure to the family members of the victims. Any delay in this regard and prolonging the entire process would only exacerbate their suffering…” The high court further observed that the commission “is nothing but an extended limb of the government to assist the government in finding out the truth of an incident having wider public importance or ramifications”. It does not function “on the faith reposed by the petitioners seeking to derive material from the Commission to suit their own ends”. The state government set up the Justice K A Puj commission to probe the Shrey Hospital fire incident and Justice D A Mehta to inquire into Uday Shivanand Hospital. On December 11, 2020, the government entrusted both the inquiries to the Justice Mehta commission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/stay-lifted-report-on-fires-submitted/articleshow/81767662.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Leopard, 2 lions locked in deadly street fight||AHMEDABAD: When cats clash, the encounter barely evokes a meow from people but the felines fighting in an Amreli district village ripped Tuesday’s dawn with murderous roars — a leopard was combating two lions. Such battles are common in Gir. But for the folks of Tataniya, a small village near Khamba taluka, it was a rare and frightening face-off involving the deadliest predators of the world. Eventually, the villagers saw a leopard lying injured on their home turf. When the forest department officials reached the spot, they found that the leopard was paralyzed, said a senior official. The leopard was shifted to a nearby animal rescue centre, where it now is in a critical condition. A lion is more than two times heavier than a leopard. So the leopard uses its swiftness and the cover of trees to escape. But in this case, the leopard had to deal with two lions, so a tactical retreat was probably impossible. “There have been instances of fighting between the two big cat species in the wild. It is quite rare though for a leopard and a lion to get into a fight in a village/revenue area,” said Bhushan Pandya, a wildlife photographer and member of the Gujarat State Wildlife Board. A leopard usually kills lion cubs when it can. A lion tries to finish off any leopard it encounters. Pug marks in Tataniya and wounds on the leopard’s neck revealed that two male lions attacked the leopard. The village that formed the battleground is situated near Eastern Gir sanctuary. “The lions might have targeted the leopard’s neck causing a spinal cord injury,” said another forest department official. The leopard may have come to the village to prey on dogs, said the official. “The lions could have ventured there in search of stray cattle,” he said. “The presence of the two lions made matters dangerous for the leopard.” Pandya recollects an incident where a forest official witnessed a leopard being mauled by two lions in Gir forest. “They were trying to tear it apart by pulling in opposite directions,” he said. Lions are known to control the leopard population in the wild. Gujarat has 674 lions according to the latest population count conducted earlier this year. An equal number of leopards are found in Gir and nearby areas, according to wildlife experts. Gujarat is the only state in India where lions and leopards have coexisted, just about. The conservation efforts by the Gujarat forest department with constant patrolling against poachers is one of the reasons for the wildlife uniqueness of the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/leopard-paralyzed-after-fight-with-2-lions-near-gir/articleshow/81766705.cms||Maulik Pathak

---||Ahmedabad||AMA, hospitals move Gujarat HC over sealing drive||AHMEDABAD: The Ahmedabad Medical Association (AMA) along with 44 hospitals of the city have moved the Gujarat high court seeking cover against the civic body’s sealing drive for want of proper Building Use (BU) permission and fire NOCs. The petitioners complained that a couple of hospitals have already been sealed by the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) and notices issued to many other members of the association, citing various orders issued by the high court. The HC had ordered strict action against hospitals functioning without proper firefighting equipment in place and without adequate BU permissions while hearing a PIL filed by advocate Amit Panchal seeking proper implementation of fire safety laws and action against those responsible in the Shrey Hospital fire incident. Eight Covid-19 patients had lost their lives in the fire last August. The petitioners submitted that they were facing “great hardships” because they have been running the hospitals for many years but the AMC, by misinterpreting HC orders, has started sealing the hospitals. This has caused great hardships to doctors and public at large. They complained that some of the hospitals have already been sealed and the request to re-open them are pending with authorities. They expressed apprehension that AMC would seal many more hospitals by citing a public notice issued on February 22. The petitioners have urged the HC to restrain AMC from its sealing drive, to quash its notices issued to various hospitals and to remove the seals put on hospitals being run by Deval Parikh and Mahesh Gupta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ahmedabad-medical-association-hospitals-move-gujarat-hc-over-amc-sealing-drive/articleshow/81767689.cms||---

Senior agriculture department officials remembered her as a jovial person keen on spreading love for Gujarati literature and education. She had also penned a book on education for adolescent girls. Sources said that she was pregnant. The Gandhinagar government officers’ circle was also saddened by the demise of Kirit Macwan, a section officer in the general administration department (GAD) of the state government. The number of MLAs and ministers testing positive for Covid-19 in the state assembly during ongoing budget session is growing rapidly. After junior minister Ishwarsinh Patel, state energy minister Saurabh Patel (L) also tested positive. Senior BJP MLA and pro-tem speaker Dushyant Patel also tested positive. State deputy CM Nitin Patel said, “Saurabhbhai Patel was supposed to respond to the starred questions in the state assembly on Wednesday. However, after he started feeling Covid-19 like symptoms, he got himself tested. After testing positive in the rapid antigen test, his samples for the RT-PCR were collected and now he is in home quarantine.” He added that he will be responding to questions related to the energy department on Wednesday on his behalf. So far over a dozen MLAs from the BJP and Congress have tested positive for Covid since the beginning of the budget session of the assembly a month ago. In February, chief minister Vijay Rupani had tested positive and recovered in seven days. Several experts have pointed at the large public gatherings in the past month for the manyfold increase in Covid-19 cases in Gujarat. Political parties had conducted major rallies for the local body elections, whereas the state also had many weddings and other social gatherings in February and March.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/two-government-officers-in-gujarat-succumb-to-covid-19-in-24-hours/articleshow/81767667.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Covid-19 bugs over 3,700 in state during Holi break||Lucknow: As many as 3,732 new coronavirus cases surfaced in UP over the three-day long Holi weekend. Of these, one-third or 1,384 cases were recorded in Lucknow. With this, state’s Covid-19 tally has now reached 6,15,996, including 85,515 cases in the state capital. Eighteen deaths were also recorded in the state in the past three days, including six deaths from Lucknow. Doctors attributed the increase in numbers to intensified Covid testing at entry points like airports, railway and bus stations of people who arrived in the state for Holi festivity. They added that numbers are likely to go up over the week in the wake of Holi revelry, where many flouted the safety norms. Also, the number of testing, which went down on account of closure of private labs during Holi, will again pick up. Health officials feel that the number of new cases could rise by at least 20-22% in next 2-3 days. The number of active infections has also increased from 6,615 on March 27 to 9,195 on March 30 — a steep rise of about 28% in cases in three days. “The facts that private labs were closed for two days and people had ignored Covid safety protocols during the festival are undeniable. While testing will pick up, leading to more cases, the post-Holi surge will add to the numbers,” said a senior health officer. Though the number of recoveries reached 5,98,001 on Tuesday, the gap between new cases and recoveries is constantly widening. Doctors have advised taking maximum precautions over the next few days to check the virus spread. “Even now, if people, especially those in the high risk category, follow the prevention protocols, the impending growth may be slowed if not arrested,” said a medical officer at Balrampur Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/covid-19-bugs-over-3700-in-state-during-holi-break/articleshow/81768886.cms||Shailvee Sharda

This, in turn, gives rise to suspicion about the government’s intent in this matter. Over a month ago, the chief minister had announced that the government has decided to cancel the MoU in the wake of controversies related to the EMCC deal. The government had claimed that it was unaware of the MoU signed between Kerala Shipping and Inland Navigation Corporation (KSINC) and EMCC to build vessels and trawlers and announced that it was cancelling the MoU with immediate effect. Subsequently, coastal shipping and inland navigation department issued an order on February 22 stating that the MoU is being cancelled as it is not in tune with the fisheries policy of the government, though the said MoU had nothing to do with deep-sea fishing. The relevant order of cancellation was widely publicized. Though initially reluctant, government had stated that it will cancel the parent MoU as well, signed by Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation on behalf of the government with EMCC. However, no formal orders, cancelling the MoU, has been issued by industries department more than a month after the cancellation announcement was made. It is this MoU, signed during Ascend 2020, which mentions that the project is related to ‘deep sea fishing’. Top sources in the department confirmed that no such order has been issued. “Unless the order is issued formally, the agreement continues to be valid as the MoU is between the state government and EMCC, unlike in the case of KSINC,” said a top official in the industries department. A detailed examination of government orders, issued after the relevant date, on the official website of the government shows that no order – cancelling the MoU between government and EMCC – is available. Earlier, government’s multiple claims in this subject were subsequently proven false when relevant documents surfaced, and it had also raised suspicions about the government’s claims and moves. The records, accessed by TOI under RTI, clearly shows that the government was well aware of the company's deep-sea fishing, processing and marketing project even before it inked the first MoU with the firm at Ascend 2020 global investment meet that Kochi hosted in January 2020. Both chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan and minister Mercykutty Amma had said that the MoU signed at Ascend 2020 was in sync with its declared fisheries policy but it is being cancelled only to allay concerns, if any, in the minds of people. They, however, took a different stand in the case of KSINC MoU which was only a manufacturing contract.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/state-govt-yet-to-cancel-parent-mou/articleshow/81766804.cms||KP Saikiran

Each district has been set targets. In Ranchi district, there are plans to add 1,500 more beds. In total, there are plans to add 15,000 beds by the end of April,” health secretary Kamal Kishore Soan told TOI. As on March 3, there were a little over 22,000 beds across the state. Of them, 19,000 were Covid-19 isolation beds, 2,000 oxygen-equipped beds and 577 beds in the intensive care units. On March 3, Jharkhand had 642 beds equipped with ventilators. Jharkhand has been witnessing a rise in Covid-19 cases for nearly a fortnight. As on Monday night, the state had 1,968 active cases. Of them, Ranchi had the most number of active cases (1,045). While testing dropped over the weekend owing to the festive fervour, the state’s positivity rate recorded a rise from last week. As on Monday evening, 2.59% of all the samples tested (5,985) had turned out to be positive. Experts fear the growing positivity rate might lead to more hospitalisations. “The situation is turning very grim with each passing day,” a senior health official said. Department sources said several Covid care centres, which were set up in non-health infrastructure premises, will be made up and running again. “We are hoping that the infrastructure we had put together during the peak of the pandemic last year will be sufficient to tide over a possible resurgence. However, the situation is being monitored constantly and if need be, the facilities will be added. It is important to ensure that other health services are not jeopardised,” another official said requesting anonymity. Meanwhile, with Covid-19 cases steadily rising, the district administration on Tuesday prepared eight isolation wards at the Mega Sports Complex in Hotwar in Ranchi. Every ward will have 40 beds each. While Ranchi civil surgeon Dr V B Prasad and deputy commissioner Chavi Ranjan remained unresponsive, district health officials said the bed capacity will be doubled over the week at the facility.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jharkhand-to-add-15k-additional-covid-beds-amid-sharp-spike-in-cases/articleshow/81766694.cms||Dhritiman Ray

Addressing a meeting after Singh filed his nominations, the saffron party’s Godda MP and chief minister Hemant Soren’s bête noire Nishikant Dubey said, “If you make Singh victorious on May 2 (counting day), I promise we will make Babulal Marandi the chief minister in the next six months.” Coming down heavily on the state government, Dubey branded the Soren family as Ravana and said the entire family has plundered the state over the years. Dubey also said Ansari’s son and JMM’s candidate from the seat Hafizul Hasan is a thief who according to him, “is still involved in illegal coal mining and transportation”. “Is it not the true that Hafizul is a thief and dalaal (middleman),” Dubey asked the audience and said if they would prefer such a person to be their representative. Prominent among others who addressed the meeting included the party’s national vice-president Annapurna Devi and state president Deepak Prakash beside other party MPs and MLAs. Former chief minister Babulal Marandi too endorsed Dubey's claim of toppling of the Hemant Soren government by saying BJP’s victory will result in the loss of the cabinet berth meant for Hafizul who has been introduced in the state cabinet without being an MLA as a replacement of his father. “Chief Minister Hemant Soren included Hafizul Hasan in his cabinet as part of the strategy to influence the electorate in the bypoll, but he has forgotten what his father Shibu’s fate after losing Tamar bypolls despite being the chief minister. He had lost power after that,” Marandi said, adding the Hemant Soren government will meet with the same fate after the Madhupur bypolls. Meanwhile, the ruling faction maintained that BJP’s claims have only strengthened their stand that the party is indulging in sedition against a popularly-elected government. “The way Nishikant Dubey and other BJP leaders publically claimed to topple the state government within a timeframe, shows their seditious ambitions,” Congress’s Jamtara MLA Irfan Ansari said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/will-form-govt-in-6-mnths-if-we-win-bypoll/articleshow/81766812.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey
---||Ranchi||Low-key Holi, Shab-e-Baraat held in Ranchi||Ranchi: Holi and Shab-e-Baraat were observed in a low-key manner in Ranchi on Sunday and Monday owing to the prevailing pandemic and the restrictions imposed by the government. The movement of people in the city was much lower compared to other years as residents preferred to play with colours in their homes and apartments. A resident of Kanke said, “I remained at home after visiting my maternal grandmother. There were, however, few visitors to my place this time.” Meanwhile, Shab-e-Baraat was also observed in the city. A devotee, Adil Rashid, said that people by and large obeyed the directive of the administration. He said. “The festival was observed with devotion. However, most of the devotees visited the mosque for prayers and went back home. The usual public gathering did not take place.” While reiterating that people were restrained in celebrating Holi, City DSP Amit Singh said, “The administration had deployed adequate forces round-the-clock in sensitive areas. Citizens avoided moving about in large numbers.” One person, however, was killed in Budmu while several others were injured in road accidents in different parts of the city during the festivities. Two armed miscreants shot dead a person, Manoj Yadav (35), in Barkanadi area under Budmu police station while the latter was at a shop to purchase meat. Police said that two persons armed with pistols arrived at the shop and fired in air to scare the people away. The assailants shot Yadav on the leg as he tried to flee and then fired at him several times. Police said that they were investigating the case from several angles, including the involvement of extremists.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/low-key-holi-shab-e-baraat-held-in-ranchi/articleshow/81766800.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ranchi||Steel City residents violate Covid-19 protocols on Holi||JAMSHEDPUR: Despite an advisory from the state government on prohibiting public gatherings and organising parties to celebrate Holi because of the surge in Covid cases, large groups of locals were seen playing with colours. From the 'Holi ka Dahan', the night before Holi, people were seen assembling at various places without wearing masks and without maintaining social distancing while lighting up bonfires and celebrating. When TOI talked to the revellers about the safety protocols, many of them responded saying the risks have reduced because of the vaccination drive. Ramesh Agarwal of Sonari, who is in his mid-forties, was seen playing Holi without wearing masks in a gathering of more than 30 people. Agarwal, an industrialist, who was infected in September last year, said, "How long can we live in isolation following rules? We have to come out and lead a normal life. No one knows exactly when this pandemic will last." He added that his entire family was affected by Covid and were hospitalized last year. Tyaraja (42), another reveller who was also infected by the virus in November last year, was also seen playing Holi with his friends near Keenan stadium. He was also of the opinion that they should lead a normal life. However, all clubs, which organised Holi gatherings in the past, shut their gates. Gated apartments also followed the government orders and cancelled parties within their campuses. A teacher, Ramakrishna P, living in Kadma area, said lack of policing on roads during Holi was the major reason behind such violation of the government advisory. He pointed out that even PCR vans and motorcycle-borne Tiger Mobile squads were not seen doing their rounds on the street. "So who will implement the orders," Ramakrishna questioned. The district administration officials are tight-lipped about the lack of policing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/steel-city-residents-violate-covid-19-protocols-on-holi/articleshow/81766709.cms||Debasish Chatterjee

---||India||West Bengal Assembly elections 2021: Amit Shah, Mamata Banerjee end Nandigram campaign with battle of rallies||NANDIGRAM: A battle of roadshows brought the curtain down on the high-octane campaign in Nandigram on Tuesday, with Union home minister Amit Shah targeting Mamata Banerjee for her “silence” on the fatal assault on a BJP worker's octogenarian mother. The Bengal CM hit back by mocking him for "trying to break Trinamool", only to end up stoking dissension in BJP over poll tickets. "People want jobs. They want entrepreneurship to flourish. They look forward to the day when they can live in peace and amity. They want development of all and appeasement of none. They look for strong steps against ghuspetiyas (infiltrators) and want citizenship for refugees," said Shah, who ended his roadshow at Mamata's starting point. Mamata took potshots at her aide-turned-poll rival Suvendu Adhikari by declaring that even Mukul Roy, who had jumped ship four years ago, wasn't "as bad as him". She then addressed Shah as the architect of trouble in the BJP ranks, claiming that 15 disgruntled functionaries of the saffron party had approached her for TMC tickets. Asked what would be BJP’s strategy on polling day in Nandigram on April 1, Shah told reporters later, "There is no need for a strategy. The huge gathering today speaks of the public support we have. We are going to win by a huge margin."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/shah-mamata-end-nandigram-campaign-with-battle-of-rallies/articleshow/81769979.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

---||Nagpur||Video shows yet another cop ‘drinking’ at ACP office||Nagpur: Naik police constable Manoj Thakur, posted at the office of assistant commissioner of police (ACP), MIDC division, was placed under suspension and an inquiry has been ordered by city police chief Amitesh Kumar after a video showing the cop allegedly consuming liquor at his workplace went viral. A few days ago, three cops at the office of ACP, Lakadganj division, were suspended by Zonal DCP Lohit Matani after a video of the trio consuming liquor at the workplace had gone viral on social media.While the first video of the three cops was filmed on March 10, it’s reliably learnt through senior police sources that the latest clip was shot with a mobile phone on March 2. In the latest clip, which is around 1.13 minutes long, Thakur is seen speaking on phone with someone whom he had been advising how to convince the ACP. Later, a discussion of more ‘pegs’ and ‘four-five bumper getting over’ also can be heard in the clip. The other person speaking to Thakur is also heard asking him to reveal about some places or persons whom he can round up. The commissioner of police Kumar said the latest incident looks like an aberration and strict action would be initiated. “We have placed the concerned cop under suspension and inquiry has been ordered. The issue (misuse of office premises) has already been taken up and no leniency would be shown in such cases of unacceptable misdemeanours,” he said.Zonal DCP Noorul Hassan said inquiry report would be prepared by the ACP of MIDC division and submitted before him. Police sources said a civilian, working with the ACP of MIDC division, was unhappy as Thakur had been “detaining” him even after working hours so that he can enjoy a feast. “Thakur had been regularly drinking and having snacks at the office. Last week, three cops from a police station too had come inside the office and were shocked to see the party going on,” said the source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/video-shows-yet-another-cop-drinking-at-acp-office/articleshow/81767902.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Goa||Noisy scenes over postponement of questions, House adjourned twice||Panaji: The House witnessed noisy scenes leading to its adjournment twice amidst allegations of a Rs 1,000 crore coal block scam after two starred questions — one on coal block and the other on the Mhadei — were sought to be postponed. When the Question Hour started at 11.30am, industries minister Vishwajit Rane sought to adjourn the question tabled by GFP MLAs Vijai Sardesai, Vinoda Paliencar and Jayesh Salgaonkar, and independent legislator Rohan Khaunte, that sought to know the status of the coal block. Water resources minister Filipe Neri Rodrigues requested speaker Rajesh Patnekar to postpone the question on the Mhadei issue, also tabled by the four MLAs, to the next session on the grounds that he required more time to collect information due to the latest development in the case. Rodrigues said that he can produce correct information before the House. “Under what circumstances has the question been postponed on the Mhadei?” Khaunte asked, while Sardesai said that the rules and procedure of the House did not permit it. What irked opposition MLAs was that the adjournment was sought even as replies to the two questions were tabled in the House. Sardesai insisted that as per the rules, once (written) reply is given, the question cannot be postponed. Khaunte also said that the opposition would not have asked if the reply was not given. The speaker, however, said that the minister has the right to defer a question he wants. Sardesai and Khaunte kept saying that it cannot be done as the replies were given and if the minister wanted to postpone the question, he ought to have done it 48 hours prior to circulating replies to the members. Sardesai alleged a scam of Rs 1,000 crore in the coal block allotted to Goa Industrial Development Corporatio (GIDC) at Dongri Tal II coal block in Madhya Pradesh. “What is the public interest in this? Public interest arises only when the issue pertains to national security. Coal block is not a national security issue,” said Sardesai. The opposition also said that some years ago BJP, at the national level, had filed a complaint of coalgate and, in Goa, the same party now has more to hide on the “coal scam”. Sardesai said the question has been deferred in order to have time to “fix the issue. It is a big scam. The government doesn’t want to reply. It wants to appoint a tainted consultant,” he said, joined by the Porvorim MLA. They demanded that the speaker must direct the minister to reply to the question. MGP MLA Ramkrishna Dhavalikar said that only if the answer tabled is wrong then “he (minister) can ask to defer the question to the next session”. However, as the speaker called the next question, the agitated members of the opposition walked into the well of the House, leading to adjournment of the House by ten minutes. When the House resumed 10 minutes later, Khaunte and Sardesai continued their demand making it difficult for the speaker to continue with the business in the House. He suspended the sitting of the House till 12.30pm. Addressing a press conference on this issue after the session, the opposition yet again alleged a scam and charged that a blacklisted consultant had been appointed bypassing the bidding process. Sardesai said that the appointment of questionable consultants was done through Public Private Partnership (PPP) and not by GIDC. “This clearly shows that something is amiss,” he said, alleging that the Goa government is listening to the Centre and even this issue was no exception.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/noisy-scenes-over-postponement-of-questions-house-adjourned-twice/articleshow/81767957.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
