---||Business||HDFC Bank, SBI, others not adhering to norms on bulk SMSes, says Trai||NEW DELHI: The telecom regulator on Friday released a list of 40 "defaulter" principal entities, including large banks like HDFC Bank, SBI and ICICI Bank, that are not fulfilling the regulatory norms on bulk commercial messages despite repeated reminders. Hardening its stance on the issue, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) warned that defaulting entities should comply with the stipulated requirements by March 31, 2021 "to avoid any disruption in the communication with customers" from April 1, 2021. "As sufficient opportunity has been given to principal entities/ telemarketers to comply with the regulatory requirements and that the consumers cannot be deprived of the benefits of the regulatory provisions any further, therefore it has been decided that from April 1, 2021, any message failing in the scrubbing process due to non-compliance of regulatory requirements will be rejected" by the system, Trai said in a statement. Trai's norms for commercial messages, based on blockchain technology, aim to curb unsolicited and fraudulent messages. The norms require bonafide entities sending commercial text messages to register message header and templates with telecom operators. The SMSes and OTPs, when sent by user entities (banks, payment companies and others), are checked against the templates registered on the blockchain platform -- a process called SMS scrubbing. Trai has analysed the scrubbing data and reports submitted by the telecom service providers and also held a meeting with telemarketers/ aggregators on March 25, 2021. "It has been informed that Principal Entities including major banks like State Bank of India, HDFC Bank, Punjab National Bank, Axis Bank etc are not transmitting mandatory parametres like content template IDs, PE IDs etc even in those cases where content templates have been registered, while sending such messages to telecom service providers for delivery," Trai said. The regulator, on analysing the cases of failure of messages due to scrubbing, found that various principal entities and telemarketers are not fulfilling regulatory requirements. In the absence of these necessary parameters, the messages are bound to be rejected by the system during the scrubbing process. TRAI has released a list of 40 "defaulter" principal entities which includes large banks like Bank of Baroda, Bank of India, ICICI Bank, and big names like Reliance Retail Ltd, and Samsung India Electronics Pvt Ltd. Others in the list include Life Insurance Corporation of India and National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. Separately, Trai has also issued a list of 40 "defaulter telemarketers". "Sufficient time has already been given to the Principal Entities/ telemarketers and other entities to comply with the regulatory framework. However, it appears that few entities are not only indifferent but also not serious enough in complying with the provisions of the regulations thereby causing inconvenience to customers," the Trai statement said. This "should not and cannot" be allowed to continue, it asserted. Enforcement of Trai regulations is vital as delivery of non compliant messages allows fraudulent miscreants to conveniently misuse the message delivery system for cheating and defrauding customers, it contended. Trai said entities involved in sending out bulk commercial messages should fulfil regulatory requirements. It urged regulatory bodies like RBI, Sebi, Irda, central and state government departments and other establishments to "impress upon principal entities" under their jurisdiction to follow the regulatory requirements strictly. Earlier this month, transactions, including banking, credit card payment and certain other services that involve SMSes and OTP generation, had faced an major outage when telcos implemented the Trai norms for commercial messages, without the balancing measures in place by principal entities (entities that send out bonafide bulk, commercial messages). Following the disruption, TRAI has given a temporary breather to such companies, but had insisted that they take immediate measures to comply with the norms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hdfc-bank-sbi-others-not-adhering-to-norms-on-bulk-smses-says-trai/articleshow/81713682.cms||---

However, the minister said this was "great" considering the country has bounced back so quickly in a challenging year. India's goods exports stood at $313 billion in FY20. "As against about $313 billion of goods exports last year, we will end the year with almost 93 per cent of that, $290 billion. Now isn't that great," Goyal said while addressing the Times Network India Economic Conclave. Asked about big foreign firms which have made investments in India in the past year, the commerce and industry minister said Apple and Samsung have invested on a large scale in the country and expanded their facilities. Referring to the two firms, he said: "I believe they are looking at India as their prime production base to meet the needs of the world." He added that pharma companies are also looking at expanding their investments in India. The minister also expressed confidence that going forward, India will be able to overtake China in its engagement with Bangladesh. His statement comes at a time when Prime Minister Narendra Modi is visiting Bangladesh. The Prime Minister left for Bangladesh on Friday on a two-day visit during which he will take part in a wide range of programmes aimed at furthering cooperation between the two countries. Goyal further said it will be a "record year" in terms of FDI inflows for India, despite the pandemic and "the fact that all international statistics suggest that foreign investments across the world are going to significantly fall in the current months." Observing that India was amongst the "rare countries" which saw FDI growth in 2020, the minister said he has "absolutely no doubt it will be a record FDI". Asked about India's relations with Bangladesh vis-a-vis Bangladesh-China ties, he said India has been working relentlessly to build strong relations with all its neighbouring countries. Goyal said India's ability to add more value to the products and services has helped it expand trade ties with countries like Bangladesh. "I have the confidence that going forward, we will be in a position to overtake China in their engagement with Bangladesh. We are working with that single-minded purpose and our industry has the ability," said the minister. He said India's services sector has the confidence, adding that "we in government are also proposing several initiatives, some of which should be discussed during PM Modi's visit to Bangladesh." However, he added that India does not hold a grudge against any country for its engagement with anybody else and focuses only on what it can do with that country better. Goyal, who is also the railways and consumer affairs minister, said the Indian Railways has seen the highest freight loading in its history every month since September 2020 till February 2021. "When we close March 2021, despite the setback of first few months of the lockdown, we will be exceeding last year's loading in the Indian Railways in terms of freight and it will be the highest freight loading that Indian Railways has seen in its long history," he said. On the Bharat Bandh called by farmers' organisations on Friday to protest against the three farm laws, which included train blockade, Goyal said he has been monitoring the situation and in the last report sent to him, he saw that in the whole country some 60 odd trains were disrupted for 5 to 15 minutes. The minister said this clearly shows that "farmers across the country are happy with these laws", adding that the three farm laws do not take away anything from what was already existing and they are an added option given to the farming community. Asked about the 'TRP scam', Goyal said the investigation will bring to light any wrongdoing and stringent action will be taken against the guilty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/indias-goods-exports-to-stand-at-290-billion-in-fy21-says-piyush-goyal/articleshow/81713972.cms||---

In September 2019, the RBI had superseded the board of PMC and placed it under regulatory restrictions, including cap on withdrawals by customers, after detection of certain financial irregularities and misreporting of loans given to real estate developer HDIL. The restrictions have been extended several time since then. PMC Bank had received binding offers from certain investors for its reconstruction, in response to the Expression of Interest (EOI) dated November 3, 2020 floated by the bank. RBI and PMC Bank are presently engaging with prospective investors in order to secure best possible terms for the depositors and other stakeholders while ensuring long term viability of the reconstructed entity, the central bank said in a statement. Given the financial condition of PMC Bank, the process "is complex and is likely to take some more time", it said, while extending the various regulator restrictions on the lender till June 30. Last time, the restrictions were extended in December 2020 till March 31, 2021. "It may be clarified that the process of reconstruction will be commenced as soon as the aforesaid objectives are achieved to the best possible extent," the RBI added. PMC's exposure to HDIL was over Rs 6,500 crore or 73 per cent of its total loan book size of Rs 8,880 crore as of September 19, 2019. Initially, the RBI had allowed depositors to withdraw Rs 1,000 which was later raised to Rs 1 lakh per account to mitigate their difficulties. In June 2020, the RBI had extended the regulatory restrictions on the cooperative bank by another six months till December 22, 2020. As of March 31, 2020, PMC Bank's total deposits stood at Rs 10,727.12 crore and total advances at Rs 4,472.78 crore. Gross NPA of the bank stood at Rs 3,518.89 crore at end-March 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-says-engaged-with-prospective-investors-to-secure-best-terms-for-pmc-bank-depositors/articleshow/81713752.cms||---

Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal had a "very productive discussion" with the United States Trade Representative (USTR) Ambassador Katherine Tai, over a video call on March 25, 2021. Goyal congratulated Tai on her appointment as USTR. "They discussed a range of issues and agreed to strengthen the India-US trade and investment relationship. "The conversation included consolidating economic partnership between like-minded democracies upholding the principles of openness, transparency and fair trade," the commerce ministry said. The statement said both agreed to further India-US economic cooperation on the basis of shared objectives and resolve pending legacy issues through mutual dialogue and discussion. "They also agreed to strengthen the India-US Trade Policy Forum (TPF) and to convene the next ministerial-level meeting of the forum in 2021," the ministry stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/india-us-agree-to-strengthen-trade-investment-ties/articleshow/81714028.cms||---
---||Business||BPCL sells 54.16% stake in NRL to OIL; 4.4% to EIL||NEW DELHI: Privatisation-bound Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) on Friday said it has sold its entire 61.5 per cent stake in Numaligarh Refinery in Assam to a consortium of Oil India Ltd and Engineers India and government of Assam for Rs 9,876 crore. OIL bought a 54.16 per cent stake to raise its shareholding in the refinery to 80.16 per cent, the company said in stock exchange filings. Its partner, Engineers India Ltd (EIL) bought a 4.4 per cent stake and the balance 3.2 per cent was acquired by Government of Assam. The sale of Numaligarh Refinery Ltd (NRL) clears the way for privatisation of India's second-largest fuel retailer. In keeping with the Assam Peace Accord, the government had decided to keep NRL in the public sector. As part of this, BPCL was to sell its entire 61.65 per cent stake to state-owned firms. A consortium of OIL, EIL, and Government of Assam expressed interest in buying the stake. "A Sale Purchase Agreement has been signed on March 25, 2021 between BPCL and the consortium of OIL and EIL for sale of 43.05 crore in NRL to the consortium at a consideration of Rs 9,375.96 crore," BPCL said in the filing. The remaining 2.29 crore equity shares have been transferred to Government of Assam for Rs 499.99 crore. "Post these acquisition OIL's cumulative equity shareholding in NRL (including pre-acquisition 26 per cent shareholding) is 80.16 per cent," the firm said in a separate filing. EIL said it paid Rs 699.99 crore for 3.21 crore shares in NRL while OIL bought 39.84 crore shares for Rs 8,675.96 crore. "Chairman and managing director OIL, who is presently a nominee director of OIL on the board of the Target Company (NRL) would be designated as Chairman," it said. Existing directors nominated by BPCL on the board of NRL would resign and rights of BPCL to appoint directors would be extinguished, it said. BPCL sold shares in NRL at a price of Rs 217.75 per share, totalling Rs 9,875.96 crore. NRL operates a 3 million tonnes per annum oil refinery in Assam. OIL currently holds 26 per cent stake in NRL while Government of Assam has around 12.35 per cent. Post NRL sale, BPCL would be left with three refineries at Mumbai, Kochi (Kerala) and Bina (Madhya Pradesh). The government is selling its entire 52.98 per cent stake in BPCL in the nation's biggest privatisation till date. Vedanta Group and private equity firms Apollo Global and I Squared Capital's Indian unit Think Gas have put in an expression of interest for buying the government's stake. The sale of NRL is the first step towards the disinvestment of BPCL. The government has already indicated that it expects to complete BPCL privatisation by the first half of the fiscal beginning April (2021-22). The sale is key to achieving the Rs 1.75 lakh crore disinvestment target set for 2021-22. BPCL will give the buyer ownership of around 15.33 per cent of India's oil refining capacity and 22 per cent of the fuel marketing share. NRL is looking to expand its refining capacity from 3 million tonnes per annum to 9 million tonnes a year at an investment of Rs 22,594 crore. The project is expected to be completed by 2024. The expansion also involves setting up of crude oil pipeline from Paradip in Odisha to Numaligarh and a product pipeline from Numaligarh to Siliguri in West Bengal. In the run-up to the privatisation, BPCL last month agreed to buyout Oman Oil Company's shares in the Bina refinery project for about Rs 2,400 crore. BPCL holds a 63.68 per cent stake in Bharat Oman Refineries Ltd (BORL), which built and operates a 7.8 million tonne oil refinery at Bina. It will buy 36.62 per cent of the equity share capital from OQ S.A.0.C. (formerly known as Oman Oil Company S.A.0.C.) for Rs 2,399.26 crore. BORL was incorporated in February 1994 to build a refinery at Bina. The unit initially could turn 6 million tonnes of crude oil annually into fuel, which was subsequently raised to 7.8 million tonnes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/bpcl-sells-54-16-stake-in-nrl-to-oil-4-4-to-eil/articleshow/81714043.cms||---
---||Business||WeWork agrees $9 billion SPAC merger to finally get stock market listing||NEW DELHI: WeWork said on Friday it has agreed to go public through a merger with blank-check firm BowX Acquisition Corp, enabling the office-sharing company to complete a stock market listing two years after its failed first attempt. The merger with BowX, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), values WeWork at around $9 billion, a steep drop from the $47 billion the money-losing company was worth in a 2019 private funding round led by Japanese conglomerate SoftBank Group Corp. Later in 2019, WeWork attempted an initial public offering but pulled the plans due to investor concerns over its business model and co-founder Adam Neumann’s management style. Neumann ultimately stepped down as chief executive. Sandeep Mathrani is now CEO, and his work has included cutting costs by $1.6 billion, according to WeWork. “Sometimes you don’t pick the path (and) a path picks you. In December, we were approached by BowX and other SPACS,” Mathrani told CNBC in an interview. “We had seen a path to profitability and we thought it was a good time to raise additional liquidity to de-risk the balance sheet, and to make sure that we have a path to profitability,” Mathrani added. BowX shares on Nasdaq were up 8% in morning trading. SoftBank, WeWork’s largest backer, will retain a majority stake in the company after the deal. SoftBank and other investors have agreed to a one-year lock-up on their shares, according to a person familiar with the matter. Current shareholders will own about 83% of the combined company. SPACs like BowX are shell companies that raise funds in an IPO with the goal of merging with an unidentified private company. For the company being acquired, the merger is an alternative way to go public over a traditional IPO. Prospective investors in WeWork’s 2019 IPO were in part spooked by losses that stretched into the billions of dollars with no clear path to profitability. WeWork has yet to turn a profit. Its adjusted EBITDA, a measure of a business’ underlying profitability, was -$1.8 billion in 2020. WeWork forecasts this will be -$900 million in 2021 but predicts it will achieve operating profitability of $500 million in 2022. WeWork has also had to weather the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to many office staffers working from home. WeWork’s revenues for 2020 were flat at $3.2 billion, but the company and real estate industry experts expect there will be growing demand after the pandemic for the sort of flexible offices provided by companies like WeWork. “We believe that WeWork is going to be the opportunity stock for the recovery,” BowX co-CEO Vivek Ranadivé told CNBC. In total WeWork expects to raise $1.3 billion in cash from the merger, funded by the $420 million BowX raised in its IPO in August and an $800 billion private investment in public equity (PIPE) from investors including Insight Partners, Starwood Capital Group and Fidelity Management. BowX had initially looked to raise $500 million for the PIPE but increased this due to investor demand, according to people familiar with the matter. PJT Partners was WeWork’s financial adviser on the deal. UBS Group AG advised BowX.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/wework-agrees-9-billion-spac-merger-to-finally-get-stock-market-listing/articleshow/81714085.cms||---

He emphasised the need for developing frameworks with strong community-connect and enabling technology to steer action in public policy. The IPPN conference is a two-day virtual conference bringing together academics, researchers and practitioners from national and international universities, research institutions, civil society organisations, public agencies and the private sector from across the world. This is the third edition of the conference and will see over 100 individual paper presentations and 70 proposal presentations over a period of two days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/pro-poor-public-welfare-community-connect-and-technology-are-means-to-transparency-pms-advisor/articleshow/81714120.cms||Swati Rathor

In March last year, AIFF’s integrity officer Javed Siraj forwarded a report from London-based betting watchdog Sportradar, who red-flagged six matches in the GPL. All six games had suspicious betting patterns, indicative of match manipulation. GFA was asked to inquire and submit a report. But more than a year later, even as there are more games that have now come under the fixing scanner this season, there is no sign of an inquiry. “I understand that a committee to investigate the matter was formed by GFA, but we have not received any report about the decision taken by the committee till date,” AIFF general secretary Kushal Das wrote to GFA president Churchill Alemao early this month. Das was forced to seek answers after GFA’s own executive committee members suggested more instances of match-fixing in this season’s GPL. “The new edition of the Goa Professional League has commenced and we are again hearing lot of rumours of match manipulation including from GFA executive committee members, which is giving a bad name to the league and causing aspersions on the integrity of Indian football,” said Das. Some executive committee members who had written to AIFF have now been vindicated. In a confidential note to all members and participating clubs on Tuesday, GFA general secretary Jovito Lopes admitted that matches in the league continue to be either fixed or manipulated. “Since the start of the season, our data and integrity partners Genius Sports have alerted us to several matches which they have strong indications have been fixed and/or otherwise manipulated for betting purposes. This is simply unacceptable,” said Lopes. The GFA initially conducted its own probe but that turned out to be shambolic as it pointed an accusing finger at its own partner. The report – from the secretary – was rejected by AIFF’s integrity officer. Since then, there has been little progress. The GFA now has an ethics committee in place and the ethics code was also adopted at the last executive committee meeting. But questions have been asked why it’s taken so long to investigate match-fixing, or why the GFA did not lodge a complaint with Goa police. “GFA may consider filing of FIR with local police,” said Das. “Kindly look into the matter personally and ensure that the enquiry committee completes the investigation expeditiously and exemplary punishment is awarded if required.” Till last week, matches were being played behind closed doors at the Duler Football Stadium in Mapusa due to the coronavirus pandemic. All 66 matches, though, are being televised live by the GFA’s new broadcast partner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/a-year-later-aiff-yet-to-receive-goas-match-fixing-inquiry-report/articleshow/81714128.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Goa||Churchill Brothers keep the faith||PANAJI: Regardless of what happens in the concluding game of this season’s I-League, Churchill Bros FC coach Fernando Varela believes this has been a “good season." Whatever happens against Punjab FC on Saturday, Churchill Bros will finish third, their best performance since winning the I-League in 2013. They finished in the top five just once in the last six years. “Regardless of what happens (against Punjab), I believe it is a good season,” Varela told TOI on Friday. “For me, we are the best team in the league. We have played well, grown together as a team, played attacking football. The players are amazing, and I am really proud of the team. We have shown the fans, the players and everyone else that we are a great team.” At Churchill, though, greatness is measured only in trophies. Anything else has little significance. Churchill, for the record, finished runners-up five times since the inception of National Football League (NFL) in 1996-97. This team could have so easily achieved true greatness. It was all in their hands. For 11 matches, they were better than all others by a mile. They were unbeaten. Then the unthinkable happened; Churchill lost two matches in a row, and picked up just a point against TRAU. Just a point from their last three matches has changed equations. With just one game left to be played, they are the third favourites for the I-League title, behind TRAU and Gokulam Kerala, who take on each other knowing the winner will take home the trophy. Churchill will come into the picture only if the TRAU-Gokulam encounter ends in a draw, and they themselves pick up all three points against Punjab at the VYBK stadium. “We are conscious of what we need to do to win the I-League. Our goal is to beat Punjab. We will hope for a draw in the other fixture,” said Varela. Goals have suddenly dried up for Churchill. A team that was scoring so heavily, thanks to the exploits of Slovenian striker Luka Majcen and Honduran Clayvin Zuniga scored just two in their last three games, both from the spot. The penalties were converted by Majcen, who is now a contender for the Golden Boot with 10 goals, behind Bidyasagar Singh (11) and Dennis Antwi (10). His eyes, though, are on the bigger prize. “On my mind, first is the team winning and the trophy. I can definitely help the team with goals as a striker. The Golden Boot will be just side effect of my help for the team. “We are thinking only about the game. We cannot think about other things as we could lose focus. We need to aim for a victory. The other game is not in our hands, so we need to focus on beating Punjab first, and then think about the rest,” said Majcen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/churchill-brothers-keep-the-faith/articleshow/81714217.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

While animal lovers cite unfair treatment, others point out that strays often become aggressiveEarlier this month, a Gurgaon couple, along with their three-year-old daughter and dog, were apparently mobbed and abuses were hurled at them with neighbours objecting to their habit of feeding strays inside the housing society. While the couple and the RWA had different stories to tell, the issue of feeding strays has always been a contentious one across NCR, which has long divided residents. Since street dogs cannot be relocated as per the law, there are many instances where residents have got into arguments with those trying to feed strays inside residential complexes. ‘We were held hostage in our complex for feeding the stray, is that okay?’Shocked with what happened with them, the family says that the incident was a horrifying experience. Reacting to allegations that the dog they were feeding is aggressive and has bitten a few people, the man replies, “Why would I be okay with an animal biting another person or their kids? I too have a daughter, and if the animal is aggressive and attacks, why has he not attacked anyone in my family?” He adds, “Though there are no medical records of the dog biting others, I want to ask in what capacity it is okay to hold a family hostage without food and water?” ‘Not against the dog, but no resident should be harmed because of the animal’Ram Mehar, RWA President of the society where the incident happened, shares, “Our RWA wants that within the legal ambit, jo bhi arrangement ho sakta hai iss dog ka woh kiya jaaye taaki woh logon ko bite na kare. We have no problem with the dog, the dog can stay inside or outside the society, but peacefully. Our only request to all the regulators – including the MCG, administration, the couple and NGOs is that within the ambit of law, we should reach a solution so that all stakeholders live peacefully. Nobody is against the dog, but everybody’s concern is that the dog should not bite anyone.” ‘Wherever there are animal lovers, the easy way out is to silence them’Dog feeding is something that has always divided feeders and non-feeders in gated societies. Animal activist Chetna Joshi, who was present when the incident happened, explains, “We can’t come to a conclusion because one side of the stakeholders doesn’t want to come to a conclusion. They either want to poison the dogs or send them to a shelter. Wherever there are animal lovers, the easy way out is to silence them. Jab intolerance khatam hoga,  tabhi toh dono parties milkar baithkar baat karenge.” Kaveri Rana Bhardwaj, President, PFA Gautam Buddh Nagar, points out that lack of awareness is a reason for such incidents. “We should have constant dialogue, awareness camps and sessions where such issues are discussed, without the mob mentality. This is not justified. Community dogs are protected by Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act (PCA), Animal Birth Control (Dogs) Rules 2001 and Supreme Court judgement,” she says. ‘Feeders often go through such treatment’This is not the first time feeders in a society or condominium have faced the brunt of agitated neighbours. Sonia Khanna Walia, a resident of Gurgaon, says a similar incident happened to her as well. “Residents of my society organised a protest against me. Banners were made and the protest was organised near my house. People in our society were not comfortable with strays. But we fought for them and told them that according to the Supreme Court, they are a part of our society, they cannot be relocated. You need to sit down and discuss solutions. Make a plan about when one can feed dogs. And trust me, if their tummies are full, they don’t even bark. That is how we ultimately resolved the issue in our society,” she says. ‘Housing socities must assign designated areas to feed strays’Dhanshree Panchbhai from Gurgaon, who fed 140 dogs for 110 consecutive days throughout the lockdown, says she never faced any issue with her neighbours or the police. “Feeding strays is one grey area that individuals need to understand. If you have to feed a dog, please do so in a designated area. Residents say there should be designated areas allotted where one can feed strays If you know that the dogs have started getting aggressive or are biting kids or older people, complain to the authorities. There’s a balance that an individual needs to maintain. If you are feeding a dog, you have to respect other humans. Every RWA should allot a designated area or if an individual is taking care, then some more members of the society can join in and help in feeding the dog,” she says. Some people say that street dogs can be a menace since they tend to chase people on two-wheelers‘They are a menace in our society’Vasudha Bajaj* (name changed on request), who lives in a residential society in Gurgaon, says that the population of street dogs keeps increasing in their society. “And they keep chasing people on two-wheelers without any reason. Sometimes these dogs do not even let kids play outside. I am not against dogs but people should understand that they can actually create menace because how do you trust the behaviour of a street dog? I think authorities should take the right steps to not just control their population but also see if a training programme can be done for those who are actually getting aggressive on streets,” she says.

Nobody is against the dog, but everybody’s concern is that the dog should not bite anyone.” ‘Wherever there are animal lovers, the easy way out is to silence them’Dog feeding is something that has always divided feeders and non-feeders in gated societies. Animal activist Chetna Joshi, who was present when the incident happened, explains, “We can’t come to a conclusion because one side of the stakeholders doesn’t want to come to a conclusion. They either want to poison the dogs or send them to a shelter. Wherever there are animal lovers, the easy way out is to silence them. Jab intolerance khatam hoga,  tabhi toh dono parties milkar baithkar baat karenge.” Kaveri Rana Bhardwaj, President, PFA Gautam Buddh Nagar, points out that lack of awareness is a reason for such incidents. “We should have constant dialogue, awareness camps and sessions where such issues are discussed, without the mob mentality. This is not justified. Community dogs are protected by Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act (PCA), Animal Birth Control (Dogs) Rules 2001 and Supreme Court judgement,” she says. ‘Feeders often go through such treatment’This is not the first time feeders in a society or condominium have faced the brunt of agitated neighbours. Sonia Khanna Walia, a resident of Gurgaon, says a similar incident happened to her as well. “Residents of my society organised a protest against me. Banners were made and the protest was organised near my house. People in our society were not comfortable with strays. But we fought for them and told them that according to the Supreme Court, they are a part of our society, they cannot be relocated. You need to sit down and discuss solutions. Make a plan about when one can feed dogs. And trust me, if their tummies are full, they don’t even bark. That is how we ultimately resolved the issue in our society,” she says. ‘Housing socities must assign designated areas to feed strays’Dhanshree Panchbhai from Gurgaon, who fed 140 dogs for 110 consecutive days throughout the lockdown, says she never faced any issue with her neighbours or the police. “Feeding strays is one grey area that individuals need to understand. If you have to feed a dog, please do so in a designated area. Residents say there should be designated areas allotted where one can feed strays If you know that the dogs have started getting aggressive or are biting kids or older people, complain to the authorities. There’s a balance that an individual needs to maintain. If you are feeding a dog, you have to respect other humans. Every RWA should allot a designated area or if an individual is taking care, then some more members of the society can join in and help in feeding the dog,” she says. Some people say that street dogs can be a menace since they tend to chase people on two-wheelers‘They are a menace in our society’Vasudha Bajaj* (name changed on request), who lives in a residential society in Gurgaon, says that the population of street dogs keeps increasing in their society. “And they keep chasing people on two-wheelers without any reason. Sometimes these dogs do not even let kids play outside. I am not against dogs but people should understand that they can actually create menace because how do you trust the behaviour of a street dog? I think authorities should take the right steps to not just control their population but also see if a training programme can be done for those who are actually getting aggressive on streets,” she says.

---||India||In Dhaka, PM Modi talks of shared heritage, common challenges||As he paid glowing tributes to Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in Dhaka, PM Modi on Friday said the two countries had not just descended from shared heritage and were advancing towards shared development and opportunities but also faced common challenges like terror. The sense of shared concerns and synergy in goals and challenges was reciprocated by Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina, who said, “India is not only our next door neighbour, we have a historical, social, cultural heritage and geographical rapport. The people and government of India were immensely involved in the evolution process of Bangladesh during our liberation war in 1971.” Modi’s speech on the “historic” visit to mark 50 years of Bangladesh's war of liberation was significant as he slammed Pakistan for the atrocities by its army, mentioned Indira Gandhi’s contribution to the liberation and also sought to make a personal connection with the same by “proudly” reminding the people of Bangladesh that he had participated in their freedom struggle by doing a satyagraha and courting arrest at a young age. Modi said he had been traumatised by the actions of the Pakistan army which had committed genocide of its own people. He also hailed the contribution of the Indian Army to Bangladesh’s war of liberation. In her speech, Hasina spoke at length on Pakistani brutalities against the people of Bangladesh during the struggle for liberation. In an oblique reference to Pakistan, Modi said the kind of forces and mindset that gave effect to such inhuman acts were still active. “We need to remain alert and united to fight them," the PM said. He quoted late Atal Bihari Vajpayee to say that the blood of Bangladeshi and Indian soldiers ran together and would stand the test of any crafty diplomacy. Recalling Pakistan’s Operation Searchlight brutalities, Modi said the world had not discussed the issue enough. “In the middle of all this, Bangabandhu was like a ray of hope for people here and for us Indians. His courage and leadership meant that no country could enslave Bangladesh," he said, wearing what is locally known as a ‘Mujib jacket’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/in-dhaka-pm-modi-talks-of-shared-heritage-common-challenges/articleshow/81715217.cms||---

The court dismissed SP Group’s last-minute plea for evaluation of its shares for an honourable exit from Tata Sons through payment of fair compensation. The bench said, “At this stage, and in this court, we cannot adjudicate on fair compensation. We will leave it to the parties to take the Article 75 route or any other legally available route.” Read AlsoSupreme Court upholds Tata Sons' decision to sack Cyrus Mistry as chairmanThe Supreme Court on Friday upheld Tata Sons’ decision to sack Cyrus Mistry as chairman of the salt-to-software conglomerate. The court pronounced its judgment on the cross appeals filed by Tata Sons and Cyrus Investments against the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) order which hadA bench of Chief Justice SA Bobde and Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian in a 282-page judgment shredded SP Group and Mistry’s arguments against Tata Sons and wondered how the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) could have deviated from the law to order Mistry’s reinstatement even after expiry of his tenure as executive chairman and direct conversion of Tata Sons into a public company. The court said, “In fact, it may be conceded today by Tata Sons that one important decision that the board took on March 16, 2012 (appointment of Mistry as executive deputy chairman) certainly turned out to be the wrong decision of a lifetime.” Read AlsoCan SP pledge Tata Sons shares? Opinion differsThe dust has not yet settled on the Tata Sons-Shapoorji Pallonji (SP) Group battle as the two have come up with different interpretations of a crucial point in the Supreme Court (SC) order: “All interim applications, including the one for causing separation of ownership interests of the SP Group inWriting the judgment for the bench, CJI Bobde laid the blame squarely at the doors of Mistry and SP Group for starting the fight with Tata Group and Ratan Tata. “It is an irony that the very same person who represents shareholders owning just 18.37% of the total paid-up share capital and yet identified as the successor to the empire, has chosen to accuse the very same board of conduct oppressive and unfairly prejudicial to the interests of the minorities,” the bench said. The SC blamed Mistry for bringing misfortune on himself by attempting to set the house on fire, the safekeeping of which was entrusted to him. “In any event, the removal of a person from the post of executive chairman cannot be termed as oppressive or prejudicial,” the SC said. Read AlsoNext face-off may be over valuation, says lawyerThe Supreme Court saying it cannot adjudicate on a fair compensation on Mistry camp’s plea for separation of ownership interests may lead to another round of litigation in the future.“Mistry himself sought, while accepting the office, the continued guidance of Ratan Tata. When the board, of which Mistry was chairman, nominated Ratan Tata as chairman emeritus and recorded their desire to look forward to his support and guidance, it was not open to the SP Group to call Ratan Tata a shadow director. If someone, aggrieved after his removal from office can engage in shadow boxing through the companies controlled by him, he cannot accuse the very same person who chose him as successor to be a shadow director. Someone who gained entry through the very same door, cannot condemn it when asked to exit,” the CJI said. Dismissing the claim of SP Group companies that Tata Sons’ affairs were conducted in a manner oppressive towards minority shareholders like SP Group, the SC said, “If the company’s affairs have been or are being conducted in a manner oppressive or prejudicial to the interests of the SP Group, we wonder how a representative of the SP Group, holding a little over 18% of the share capital, could have moved up to the topmost position within a period of six years of his induction.” Read AlsoChronology of events in Tata-Mistry caseThe Supreme Court on Friday set aside the NCLAT order restoring Cyrus Mistry as executive chairman of Tata Group. Mistry was ousted as Tata Sons chairman in 2016.Referring to Mistry’s conduct in causing a sensation by leaking to media his confidential email accusing Tata Sons directors of not discharging their duties and calling Tata Trust’s nominee directors “postmen” and his writing to tax authorities about Tata Sons’ accounts, the bench said such conduct surely warranted his removal. “A person who tries to set his own house on fire for not getting what he perceives as legitimately due to him does not deserve to continue as part of any decision-making body (not just the board of a company). It is perhaps this realisation that made the complainant companies (SP Group) give up their original prayer for restraining the company from removing Mistry and singing a different tune seeking proportionate representation on the board,” the SC said. Read AlsoSC order vindicates our position, upholds governance standards: Tata Sons on verdictTata Sons -- the holding company if Tata Group -- on Friday expressed its gratitude to the honorable Supreme Court for its order in fight against former chairman Cyrus Mistry and said that the verdict vindicated the position of the company.The SC slammed the NCLAT for ordering Mistry’s reinstatement even when it was not sought by the SP Group. “It is incomprehensible that the NCLAT directed reinstatement, and that too of a director of a company, after the expiry of his term of office. Needless to say that such a remedy would not have been granted even by a labour court/service tribunal in matters coming within their jurisdiction,” the CJI said. Referring to Mistry’s team’s allegation about failed business ventures like the Tata Nano car project and telecom venture Docomo, the SC said, “Failed business decisions and the removal of a person from directorship can never be projected as acts oppressive or prejudicial to the interests of the minorities, it is too well settled.” The SC also rejected SP Group’s claim for proportionate representation on the Tata Sons board. “The right to claim proportionate representation is not available even to a minority shareholder statutorily, both under the 1956 Act and under the 2013 (Companies) Act. It is available only to a small shareholder, which SP Group is certainly not. The right to claim proportionate representation is not available to the SP Group even contractually, in terms of the articles of association. Neither SP Group nor Mistry can request the tribunal to rewrite the contract, by seeking an amendment of the articles of association,” the SC said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tatas-making-cyrus-chairman-wrong-decision-of-lifetime-sc/articleshow/81715818.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||Mumbai||9 dead as fire sweeps through hospital inside Mumbai mall||Nine patients died on Friday after a fire swept through Sunrise Hospital, a Covid care facility in Mumbai's Bhandup area, located inside a mall marred by violations. All but one of the victims from the 107-bed hospital were senior citizens. Two more bodies recovered were of patients who had died of Covid earlier, said the hospital. In all, 78 patients were brought down with ladders and lifts or led out by firemen using the Dreams Mall's staircases. The 11 who succumbed were declared dead on reaching other hospitals. Asphyxia was cited as the reason. CM Uddhav Thackeray, who visited the site, has promised to punish those guilty and apologised to the victims’ families. He also announced Rs 5 lakh compensation to kin of each victim. Officials said the hospital inside Dreams Mall was first proposed in 2014 but the plan was stalled. It operated on a provisional occupation certificate granted in May 2020 by the BMC though the building that housed it had got notices for construction irregularities and fire safety violations. The cause of the fire which led to the deaths has not been ascertained yet, said a fire brigade official. However, he said flames seemed to have spread from the first floor of the mall. The hospital was located on the third floor and the first floor had shops for home decor and imitation jewellery. Officials said Sunrise Hospital was first proposed in 2014, but the plan was stalled. Eventually, it operated on a provisional Occupation Certificate granted in May 2020 by the BMC though the building which housed it had got notices for construction irregularities and fire safety violations. Incidentally, the basement, first and second floors had failed to get an 'all clear' from the fire department. However, Sunrise Hospital applied for and promptly got an 'NOC' from the very same department. "The fact that there were not enough ducts to let the smoke out after the fire started shows that the go-ahead was given without a rigorous fire safety audit," said an official. Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray who visited the spot said action will be taken against those found responsible. He apologised to the victims' families and announced Rs 5 lakh compensation to kin of each victim. An official said the fire brigade would serve a notice to the mall and hospital under Maharashtra Fire Prevention & Life Safety Measures Act 2006. Uddhav said the state last year gave temporary permission to some hospitals to boost health infrastructure to treat Covid-19 patients; the permission given to the Bhandup hospital was to end on March 31, he said. He directed the administration to conduct an audit of all hospitals inside any structure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/9-dead-as-fire-sweeps-through-hospital-inside-mumbai-mall/articleshow/81716443.cms||Richa Pinto

The bandh also coincided with the Bharat bandh call given by Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) against the three farm laws enacted by the Centre recently. The 9am to 2pm Bihar bandh had the support of the RJD, Congress, CPI(ML), CPI and CPM, while workers of the Jantantrik Adhikar Party-Loktantrik (JAP-L) led by former MP Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav indulged in violence at Patna. Vehicles were damaged at some places in the state capital. The RJD and CPI(ML) supporters burned tyres on the national highways and in the towns to disrupt vehicular movement. Banks and government offices functioned as usual. Water resources department minister Sanjay Kumar Jha, who was going to Darbhanga from Patna in the morning, was trapped in the jam near Bhagwanpur in Vaishali district as the bandh supporters had blocked the road. The Bihar bandh call had been given against the “misbehaviour” of police personnel with women MLAs during the passage of the Bihar Special Armed Police Bill on March 23. Leader of opposition in state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav could not participate in the bandh as he was in mourning due to the death of his elder uncle Mahavir Prasad Yadav. In Nalanda, RJD and Left workers blocked roads at several important points. Police had to resort to use minor force to clear road blockade near Biharsharif Hospital Mor. Nalanda SP Hari Prasath himself led a police team to clear Biharsharif-Rajgir road near Peepaltal village under Noorsarai. In Madhepura, big business establishments remained closed and commercial vehicles were off the roads. The vehicular movement was disrupted on NH-106 and 107. In Gaya, shops remained open in main market areas, including K P Road, Tekari Road and G B Road. In the rural areas, vehicular movement was affected in the first half but became normal as the day progressed. In Purnia, more than 200 workers belonging to JAP (L), Congress, RJD and Left parties approached forcibly downed shutters of several business establishments. Traffic movement remained disrupted on NH-31 for several hours. The bandh passed off peacefully in Sitamarhi. The RJD supporters took out a protest march in the town and blocked some roads, including Kargil bypass. In Bagaha, CPI(ML) workers took out a march. Vehicular movement was paralyzed on NH-27 for nearly two hours. In Chhapra, the bandh supporters carried the effigies of PM Narendra Modi and CM Nitish Kumar on the streets and later burned them at Rajendra roundabout. In Bhagalpur, shops and other commercial establishments in the main market areas in the town downed their shutters, as the bandh supporters went around asking businessmen and traders to support their cause. In Nawada, Mahagathbandhan leaders and workers blocked the Prajatantra Chowk adjacent to Nawada collectorate. In Begusarai, workers of RJD and CPI (ML) disrupted traffic on NH-31 and NH-28 for over two hours. Bandh supporters blocked the road between Sahebpur Kamal and Barauni Zero mile on NH-31.

These sessions were followed by specially-curated virtual tours of five national and international museums. The Museum of Art & Photography, Bengaluru, displayed the collection ‘Mithila’s Daughter’, putting spotlight on Ramayana as seen through two of its principal characters, Sita and Hanuman. “The exhibition is a tribute to Bihar’s folklore and also an attempt to acquaint spectators with multiple perspectives of Ramayana through different genres of art,” said Kamini Sawhney, director of the museum. Giving a virtual tour that was streamed live on various digital platforms, the Indira Gandhi Rashtriya Manav Sangrahalaya, Bhopal displayed crafts and artefacts reflecting the unique aesthetic sense of tribal and folk communities of the country. The Castle Museum of Pszczyna, Poland showcased the interiors of the well-preserved former princely estate in the south of the country. Kanha Museum of Life and Art, Singinawa and Kiran Nadar Museum of Art, New Delhi also showcased their signature artefacts during the exhibition. The first session by Prayag Shukla, a poet and fiction writer, focused on writing for art in Hindi by inter-relating art and language as a cultural discourse. “Expression of aesthetics in Hindi language is difficult but beautiful when expressed correctly,” he said. Ira Mukhoty, a renowned author, delved into the erasure of women from India’s mythology and history and its continuing relevance today. Meanwhile, for people visiting Bihar Museum during the biennale week, two curated exhibitions on the making of the museum by leading architect Rahul Gore and another highlighting collection of Bihar’s 19 local state museums are major attractions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/museum-biennale-exhibition-puts-spotlight-on-ramayana/articleshow/81714080.cms||---
---||Delhi||Wave City files plea with NCLT, seeks insolvency action||NEW DELHI: Wave Mega City Center (WMCC), controlled by the Ponty Chadha family, has sought action under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) after Noida Authority decided to seal the project as the developer could not pay the fresh demand of Rs 2,975 crore. The company, whose projects have been under construction for the last several years, filed a petition with the National Company Law Tribunal soon after the government lifted the freeze on IBC action. Wave’s insolvency plan will not affect the group’s other projects in Sector 18 in Noida, Wave City in Ghaziabad and Mohali, company executives said. The delay had irked buyers, some of whom had gone to police, leading to Wave Group’s vicechairman Manpreet Chadha being stopped from flying out of the country almost two years ago. The company, however, sought to blame the Noida Authority for its latest action. A senior executive said that the company was left with no option but to approach NCLT as the Noida Authority decided to penalise it for the delay in implementing the settlement under the Project Settlement Policy (PSP), which the Wave had applied for in 2017. The company claimed that the move was to protect the interests of buyers, who now face uncertainty about the fate of their investment. Buyers have so far paid around Rs 1,400 crore. The company, however, claimed that the IBC move would cost the promoter Rs 2,200 crore. WMCC already sold 2,400 housing units and shops, of which around 700 units are already complete and received completion certficate of 280 units. Responding to queries on WMCC, Wave Infratech MD Rajiv Gupta said, “We cannot comment as the matter is subjudice. We are working for the best interest of the buyers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/wave-city-files-plea-with-nclt-seeks-insolvency-action/articleshow/81717098.cms||Prabhakar Sinha

The event, which began on March 23, is helping the locals learn about the importance of a balanced diet and address the problem of malnourishment. According to Vivek Kumar, director of the District Rural Development Agency, the main purpose of ‘Poshan Pakhwada’ organised under the Integrated Child Development Services is to raise awareness among women and children about the ill-effects of malnutrition and ways to lead a healthy life. While manning one of the counters on Thursday, Deepak Kumar Deep, a block project assistant (BPA) from Mansahi, told this reporter, “We counsel the visitors and give them pictorial pamphlets with information on topics like balanced diet, dwarfism, obesity, malnourishment and anaemia among pregnant and lactating women.” Another BPA, Mukesh Kumar, could be seen telling the locals about the role of the seven basic food groups. “It is important to consume chapatis, rice, pulses, green and leafy veggies, fish, mutton, eggs, milk, fruits and nuts to lead a healthy life,” he claimed. Mukesh added, “We have observed that if the head of a family, who is usually a man, consumes leafy vegetables, pulses, eggs, chapatis and rice, his dependents also eat healthy. On the other hand, if he does not adopt healthy habits, the other members also eat poorly.” Two other BPAs, Riya Kumari and Manish Kumar, pointed out that accredited social health activists and anganwadi workers were also helping them spread information about a balanced diet at the village and the block levels. “They visit all the houses and conduct meetings where women are told about the problem of malnutrition among children. They also distribute iron, vitamin and deworming tablets,” the BPAs said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/govt-sensitises-people-to-role-of-healthy-diet/articleshow/81695018.cms||---

Despite the rejection of nomination papers of three JD(U) candidates—Dimi Hasepi (Diphu), Abul Kalam Azad (Jaleswar) and Bornali Baruah (Gauhati East)— during the scrutiny, the party is still in the fight in 34 constituencies. But what has baffled poll analysts is that all of JD(U)’s top leaders, including CM Nitish Kumar, have so far stayed away from campaigning in the Assam polls. The campaigning for the first phase of the three-phase Assam polls ended on March 25.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); Sources said only four JD(U) leaders — rural development minister Shrawan Kumar, northeast in-charge Sanjay Verma, election in-charge for Assam and West Bengal Ramprit Mandal and MLC Gulam Rasool Baliyawi — have campaigned in Assam so far for the first and second phases on March 27 and April 1. The third phase will be held on April 6.

Opposition leaders in Bihar alleged that JD(U)’s top leaders are staying away from campaigning in Assam because of “certain pressure” from BJP, its bigger partner in Bihar. “JD(U)’s Nitish Kumar is running a coalition government in Bihar with support of BJP whereas, in Assam, the BJP-led alliance is in power. If JD(U)’s top leaders go to Assam they might have to speak against the BJP-led government to attract the electors. The JD(U) is working as per the election strategies of the BJP in Assam,” RJD’s spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan told TOI on Friday. JD(U’s national secretary and northeast region in-charge Sanjay Verma rejected the allegations. “There is no pressure from BJP on us. BJP can’t create any pressure on us. Except for Bihar, JD(U) has no alliance with the BJP in any other states.

---||Hyderabad||Telangana dependent on WMA & overdraft from RBI to stay afloat, says report||HYDERABAD: The Telangana government is still dependent on ways and means advances (WMA) as well as the overdraft facility extended by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to maintain its cash flows, observed the Comptroller & Auditor General (GAG) report tabled in the Assembly on Friday. In financial year 2019-20, the state maintained the mandatory minimum daily cash balance of Rs 1.38 crore with RBI for only 197 days during the year. It depended on special drawing facility (SDF) of Rs 5605 crore for 168 days, ways and means advances of Rs 13,617 crore for 135 days and overdraft of Rs 2600 crore for 32 days for maintaining the minimum balance with RBI. States are allowed to take overdraft from RBI when the daily cash balance falls below the limit prescribed by the apex bank and they have exhausted the normal ways and means advances as well as SDF. RBI extents the SDF and normal WMA to state governments to help them tide over temporary shortfalls in cash flows. However, it still indicates an increasing dependency of the government on WMA. The CAG also made another important observation that there has been a gap in budget estimates and actuals submitted at the end of the financial year. It has recommended that the finance department rationalise the budget preparation exercise so that the gap between the budget estimates and actuals are minimised. CAG also observed that during 2019-20, agriculture got top priority with a 97.82% increase in per capita expenditure over the previous year due to a new investment support scheme — Rythu Bandhu. There was also a 12.41% increase on health and family welfare over the previous year. On the other hand, there was a considerable dip in the per capita expenditure in respect of transport (-14.32%) and education, sports, arts and culture (-6.19%), the report stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-dependent-on-wma-overdraft-from-rbi-to-stay-afloat-says-report/articleshow/81713670.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

---||Business||Next face-off may be over valuation, says lawyer||MUMBAI: The Supreme Court saying it cannot adjudicate on a fair compensation on Mistry camp’s plea for separation of ownership interests may lead to another round of litigation in the future. The CJI-led apex court bench, while leaving it to Tata Sons and the Cyrus Mistry camp to invoke the century-old article for any eventual buyout or sellout, said: “Article 75 is nothing but a provision for an exit option (though one may think of it as an expulsion option).” “After attacking Article 75 before NCLT, the SP Group cannot ask this court to go into the question of fixation of fair value compensation for exercising an exit option,” the SC said. One of Tata Sons’s senior counsels Abhishek Singhvi said the SC was more than justified in not entering into evaluating the buyout/sellout option. “These things depend on a willing seller or a willing buyer acting consensually,” he said. “The offer to sell by anyone dehors this case and would depend on consent and Articles but not in any manner disturb this judgment. Since Article 75 remains fully intact, if and when exercised, it would have to be dealt with in accordance with law,” he added. “Attempts to disturb or reopen this judgment would be over acrobatic legal adventurism,” said Singhvi. “If the SC had gone an extra mile to evaluate the shares and order a buyout, it would have truly put an end to the most valuable corporate battles,” said advocate Cherag Balsara. He added, “By leaving valuation open to the parties, the SC has opened the floodgates to the prospect of another battle royale in respect of valuation which will be fought at all forums and will also reach the Supreme Court once again.” The SC said, “Even traditionally, the law in England and in India is to pave the way for a safe and honourable exit, when two persons in commercial relationship cannot co-exist, Article 75 of the Tata Sons’s ‘Articles of Association’ empowers the company to at any time to transfer ‘ordinary shares’ of any shareholders without following the normal procedure of transfer.” Barely used and with no instance of misuse cited, Article 75 formed a major bone of contention in the Tata-Mistry saga at both stages of the sharply fought legal battle — before NCLT as well as NCLAT.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/next-face-off-may-be-over-valuation-says-lawyer/articleshow/81715278.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Business||Can SP pledge Tata Sons shares? Opinion differs||MUMBAI: The dust has not yet settled on the Tata Sons-Shapoorji Pallonji (SP) Group battle as the two have come up with different interpretations of a crucial point in the Supreme Court (SC) order: “All interim applications, including the one for causing separation of ownership interests of the SP Group in Tata Sons, are dismissed.” An SP lawyer claimed that this includes the dismissal of Tata Sons’ application seeking to restrain SP from pledging its shares in the company. If the interpretation holds good, it means SP’s economic interest in Tata Sons will remain protected and the order will not restrict SP from raising capital against its Tata Sons shares. This would come as a relief for SP as it is in the midst of finalising a restructuring plan for its over Rs 22,000 crore debt under the RBI’s special scheme introduced following the Covid crisis. A legal expert close to Tata Sons, however, has a different take on the judgment affecting the company’s application. While Tata Sons refused to comment on the issue, the person said the application seeking to restrain SP from offering the company’s shares as collateral has been allowed by the SC. The person added that part of the order is “open” to interpretation and is “not settled”. SP had pledged half of its 18.4% Tata Sons stake to Axis Bank and IDBI Bank for Rs 5,074 crore. After this move, Tata Sons filed an interim application to restrain SP from pledging further. Following the SC ruling, SP, said a source, could revisit plans of raising Rs 3,750 crore from Toronto-based Brookfield Asset Management by pledging a portion of its unencumbered 9.2% Tata Sons stake. However, if SP is restrained from pledging the Tata Sons shares, according to the Tata interpretation, it will have to release the shares pledged to Axis Bank and IDBI Bank and offer another asset as collateral. SC has also dismissed SP’s interim application seeking separation of its ownership interests from Tata Sons. SP had proposed to swap 18.4% in Tata Sons with shares of listed Tata entities including India’s most valuable IT services player TCS. The proposed separation is quite different from a buyout under Article 75 of Tata Sons’ Articles of Association. Under this Article, Tata Sons’ majority shareholders by a special resolution could force SP to transfer its shares to them any time. SP had a bone of contention over this, though Tata Sons never exercised Article 75 in its over 100-year history. Article 57 of Tata Sons specifies that the shares will have to be bought at “fair value” and Article 60 states that the board will fix the fair value based on the company’s annual audited accounts of each year. The acquirer will also have to pay a premium for the Tata brand, according to Article 77 of Tata Sons. SP had estimated its stake in Tata Sons to be worth Rs 1.78 lakh crore. SP’s estimation had included its proportionate share in the Tata brand value, which is worth a little under Rs 1.5 lakh crore, according to Brand Finance’s 2020 ranking. Tata Sons, on the other hand, had valued SP’s stake at Rs 70,000-80,000 crore, which is 55-61% lower than the minority shareholder’s estimation. The SC said that Article 75 is an exit option provision, though one may think of it as an expulsion option. “After attacking Article 75 before the National Company Law Tribunal, SP cannot ask this Court to go into the question of fixation of fair value compensation for exercising an exit option.” The valuation of the shares of SP depends upon the value of the stake of Tata Sons in listed equities, unlisted equities, immovable assets etc., and also perhaps the funds raised by SP on the security/pledge of these shares. “Therefore, at this stage and in this Court, we cannot adjudicate on the fair compensation (for SP’s stake in Tata Sons). We will leave it to the parties to take the Article 75 route or any other legally available route in this regard,” the SC said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/can-sp-pledge-tata-sons-shares-opinion-differs/articleshow/81715516.cms||Reeba Zachariah

Several Calcutta University-affiliated colleges are planning to resume classes in the second week of April and others are waiting for further instructions from the university. The classes will continue to be conducted in the online mode in the absence of any state instructions to hold on-campus classes. JD Birla Institute, affiliated to Jadavpur University, had started first-semester classes in September. “Our students got enough time to complete the syllabus and revise it. The even-semester classes began earlier this month. Though there is still a lag of a few months, we are trying to narrow the gap,” said principal Deepali Singhee. Admissions to UG and PG courses had been delayed due to the pandemic. Since the entire process was also online, it took several weeks for colleges to wrap it up, delaying the commencement of online classes. Students got less than 10 weeks to complete the syllabus after UGC instructed the colleges to wrap up the semester examinations by end of March and start the subsequent semesters by the beginning of April. Presidency University has informed students about the start of even-semester classes. While classes for UG and PG courses in history will start on April 1, the economics classes will start on April 2. “The examinations concluded by March 20 and students got a semester break of almost 12 days. We want to start the classes without wasting any time because the mode will continue to be online and we have to factor in several situations,” said a university official. At Bethune College, the authorities are contemplating starting the even semesters in the second week of April. “The last examination got over today. We are planning to start the even semesters from the beginning of the second week of April. But no decision has been taken yet,” said a college official. Many principals are also worried about the online classes since several teachers have been given election duty. “With so many teachers going on poll duty, the online classes will get hampered. We are waiting for the university to set a date for the commencement of classes,” said the principal of a north Kolkata college.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/even-sem-classes-at-presi-some-cu-colleges-from-apr/articleshow/81713621.cms||Zeeshan Javed

In an effort to arrest the rise, the health department has stepped up vaccine coverage and is also looking to increase testing numbers and add more hospitals to treat patients. So far, the Union government has provided 37 lakh vaccine doses to Andhra Pradesh. The state has vaccinated 21 lakh people as of March 25, Friday. Speaking to TOI, AP Covid-19 nodal officer Dr K Rambabu said that the health department has adopted a multi-pronged approach to contain the pandemic. “A two-week IEC campaign is currently underway in the state to promote Covid-appropriate behaviour. Right from gearing up more hospitals, the health department has been constantly monitoring stocks and position of inflammatory marker kits, medications and oxygen supplies. The department is in the process of increasing outreach of the vaccination drive,” said Dr Rambabu. The health department has started vaccination at village secretariats from Thursday. For this, concerned officials are compiling details of people aged 60 and above and persons with comorbidities at the village on the basis of non-communicable disease survey. This data would once again be reconciled through a house-to-house verification. Those missing will be added to the system. In April last year, when Andhra Pradesh was yet to see a 100 Covid-19 cases, the state government had identified six rungs of hospitals for dedicated treatment in every district. The state witnessed a full-blown outbreak between late July and early September, 2020 before cases started going down by the end of February, 2021. Owing to a consistent decline in daily case numbers, the state denotified nearly 200 Covid-19 hospitals between October and February. The number of dedicated Covid-19 hospitals came down from 248 at the peak to 42 now. However, with cases on the rise, the health department has identified nearly 240 hospitals to rope in for Covid-related services again.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/as-caseload-rises-ap-steps-up-vax-coverage/articleshow/81713296.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Staffers of cooperative banks and primary agriculture cooperative societies (PACSs) will be eligible for transfers and pay revision under the new policy. In the absence of an HR policy, staffers of PACS have been working in a single place right from recruitment to retirement. Speaking to the media in the secretariat on Friday, agriculture and marketing minister Kurasala Kannababu said the decision to design an exclusive HR policy for employees in the cooperative sector has been taken following the instructions of chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy. “The new system will not only help the employees but also the government to cleanse the system. We are appointing experts in all societies to strengthen their functioning,” said Kannababu. The minister said the government has also decided to construct agriculture processing units with an outlay of Rs 2,900 crore. He said that at least one processing unit would come up in each Lok Sabha constituency. The National Bank of Agriculture and Rural Development (Nabard) has agreed to extend financial assistance to the tune of Rs 1,300 crore to build agriculture processing units. The minister said agriculture market yards would be developed at a cost of Rs 500 crore, along the lines of the Nadu-Nedu scheme implemented in schools. Infrastructure in the market yards would be improved under Nadu-Nedu, he said, adding the green signal has been given for taking up first phase works with Rs 212 crore. Additional godowns, testing laboratories and grading centres will also be built, he said. The minister said they have approved Nabard’s credit plan to the tune of Rs 2.13 lakh crore for the forthcoming fiscal, which is nearly 9% higher than the projections for the current fiscal. Of this amount, the minister said, Nabard has been suggested to spare at least Rs 1.5 lakh crore for the agriculture sector and the remaining for the allied sectors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/govt-to-bring-in-hr-policy-for-cooperative-sector/articleshow/81713475.cms||Samdani MN

The glitches were mended as the odd-semester examinations ended on Friday. The problems that had put both the faculty and candidates on tenterhooks last time were resolved as the online exams were held without any error. From downloading question papers to uploading answer scripts, it was a smooth ride for all. As Lady Brabourne College principal Siuli Sarkar pointed out: “In October, there were multiple problem areas. From teachers to students, they had to re-learn the technique of conducting and writing the examinations. Taking a cue from the earlier problems, the problems have been mended.” “We had received calls from parents with requests that they would come over to the college to submit the answer scripts. But this time, no such request was made, which shows the system has improved. Examinees, learning from their mistakes, have been able to send the scripts well within time,” added Sarkar. The CU odd-semester examinations for both UG and PG programs started on March 8 and continued till Friday. Another college head said that during the first time, the process of receiving the question papers had to rehearse so that the students were able to receive them. “The HoDs held sessions trying to explain how to download the question papers. This time, the problem was resolved,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cu-odd-sem-exams-end-without-glitches/articleshow/81713625.cms||Somdatta Basu

YSRC leaders, while extending their support to the bandh, demanded the central government to drop the disinvestment proposal of Visakhapatnam Steel Plant. In Visakhapatnam, most commercial establishments, educational institutions and banks remained closed. The bandh was peaceful in the north Andhra districts of Srikakulam, Vizianagaram, Visakhapatnam, and the two Godavari districts. In the Rayalaseema region, the response was partial but peaceful. While bus services remained closed, commercial establishments and eateries were open. Schools and educational institutions were closed, but some government sector banks functioned as usual.

Gaya DM Abhishek Singh said steps were being taken to develop Rampur area of the town as a textile hub. The DM visited Rampur on Wednesday and talked to the weavers to collect information about availability of raw material, preparation of the products and possibilities to make handloom cafeteria so that a textile market can be developed for the foreign tourists visiting Bodh Gaya. “Promotion of handloom and textile industry will improve the financial condition of weavers as they will get more work opportunities and find a market for their products,” the DM said. He asked the executive officer of Bodh Gaya Municipal Council to inspect the land earmarked for setting up a handloom cafeteria at Rampur. “There is a need to improve road and drainage facilities in the area and ensure installation of solar lights to attract foreign tourists,” the DM said. He also asked the officials concerned to construct two big entry gates in the locality. During his Bodh Gaya visit, the DM inspected progress of various projects like science city, cultural centre (convention centre), Maya Sarovar Park and the children’s park.

---||Allahabad||Girl child education improves,registers substantial rise in UP||Prayagraj: The Union and state governments’ awareness campaigns on the importance of girl child education is gradually starting to yield results in Uttar Pradesh and is proved by the records of UP Board, specifying number of female students registered for Class X board exam this year . In the past three decades, the number of female students registering for Class X exams has increased by more than three-and-a-half times. From 3,71,083 girls who had registered for Class X board exams in 1990, the figure has increased to 13,20,290 this year. Records show that girl students accounted for just 20.89% of the total class X registrations in 1991, and have registered a substantial growth to an impressive 44.09% this year 2021. The data of UP Board, counted among the largest examination bodies in the world in terms of examinees, and also celebrating its centenary year in 2021, shows that a total of 17,75,602 students had registered for the Class X examination of 1991 in Uttar Pradesh. Of these, 14,04,519 (79.10%) were boys and 3,71,083 (20.89%) were girls, clearly showing that four out of every five students who registered for the class 10 examination was a boy while only one was a girl. Three decades later, out of the total 29,94,312 students registered for the high school examination in 2021, 16,74,022 (55.90%) are boys and 13,20,290 (44.09%) are girls. This change is visible at the intermediate level too. In 1991, there were 25% female students appearing in the Class XII exam of UP Board and has increased to 43.50% in 2021. The increase reveals that most girls completing their high school are not dropping out but are going on to study further to complete their Class XII. It is a healthy sign and shows willingness in girls to pursue higher education, said UP Board officials. These figures are also important because the students studying in UP Board usually come from middle, lower middle and poor sections of society. Commenting on the increasing number of female students, former secretary, UP Board, Nina Srivastava, said, “Awareness among parents and girls regarding the importance of girl child education has increased significantly in the society. The government has been working in this regard earnestly. The number of girl students in UP Board examinations has been increasing continuously, which is a very good trend. We all should encourage parents and girls around us to maintain this trend and ensure that girls go on to pursue higher, technical and vocational education as well.

---||Delhi||Power tussle: Raj CM backs Delhi||New Delhi/Jaipur: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday thanked Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot who backed the AAP government and called the Centre’s move to amend the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi Act “murder of democracy.” The GNCTD Amendment Bill, which seeks to give more power to the lieutenant governor, has been approved by Parliament. “Thank you Gehlot ji for backing the people of Delhi against the unconstitutional Bill of the Centre. The Constitution and democracy of the Republic of India are supreme. Our struggle to get the people the power back to the people will continue,” tweeted Kejriwal. Earlier, Gehlot said the Bill giving primacy to the LG over the elected government was passed by Parliament to curtail the rights of the AAP-led dispensation. Terming it as “murder of democracy”, he said, “abolishing the powers of an elected government is against the spirit of democracy.” “Earlier, the SC had clearly ruled that the elected government is the real head of Delhi.” “Modi govt wants to run the country in a fascist manner. Electoral malpractices, horse trading of elected MLAs, and when failing in both, it resorts to passing such a dictatorial bill on the strength of its majority in Parliament. This is how the Modi govt rules,” Gehlot tweeted. He said the BJP could abolish the powers of any government by bringing such laws if it loses elections in a state. “This dictatorial decision of the Modi govt should be opposed at the national level by rising above the party line,” he added. Accusing the BJP of doing a volte-face, the CM of the neighbouring state said that the party had earlier advocated full statehood status to Delhi. “But now, they have brought such law. Prime Minister advocates cooperative federalism, but in reality, the NDA govt is imposing decisions on state governments by enacting such laws,” he added. Speaking at a virtual programme of the state medical education department at his residence, Gehlot alleged those criticising the government are often branded as “anti-nationals”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/power-tussle-raj-cm-backs-delhi/articleshow/81728590.cms||---

Dutta was expelled from the party in October 2016 for a period of six years after he sided with the former party president, Sharad Yadav, and then opposed the “nomination of Nitish Kumar as the JD(U) chief”. But Datta’s expulsion was revoked within five years. “Rajya Sabha member and JD(U) president RCP Singh has appointed you as the president of West Bengal state unit of JDU). You are requested to constitute the state executive committee and office-bearers with representation of all sections of society viz SC/ST/ OBC/minorities and women as specified in the party constitution,” JD(U) national general secretary Afaque Ahmad Khan’s letter to Datta reads. Ashoke Das had resigned from the state unit president’s post on March 18 in protest against alleged “autocratic and undemocratic” act of the party’s national secretary Rabindra Prasad Singh and party’s West Bengal incharge Gulam Rasool Balyawi. Sources in the JD(U) said Das was willing to contest from Tarkeswar seat but he was not allotted the party ticket on time. Contacted over phone, Das said he was utterly surprised as to how a man who was expelled from the party for openly opposing the nomination of Nitish in 2016 was taken back in the organization and also given the charge of state president amid the ongoing assembly polls. “I will soon write in detail to CM Nitish Kumar, informing what is going on in the JD(U) in West Bengal,” Das told TOI over phone on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/amitava-datta-named-west-bengal-jdu-chief/articleshow/81714086.cms||Madan Kumar

Hearing a PIL filed by Anupriya Yadav and seven other law students, a division bench comprising Chief Justice Govind Mathur and Justice Ajai Kumar Srivastava-I called upon state of Uttar Pradesh, Nagar Nigam Prayagraj and Jal Nigam Prayagraj to furnish their respective response to the contents of the PIL at the earliest. The court fixed April 12 for the next hearing of this PIL. The petitioners, all students of law at various law institutes in the country, raised this issue after undertaking a detailed study with regard to objective conditions for scavenging in the city of Prayagraj and other certain areas of the state of UP. The petitioners, in their survey, found that no adequate safety equipment is provided to the scavengers and they are still working manually, which is otherwise prohibited under the Act. The petitioners submitted that whatever recommendations are made by the petitioners are in consonance to the provisions of the Act that was enacted to ensure a dignified life to the lowest rung of social hierarchy. It was asserted that the practice of manual scavenging must be done away with to restore human dignity and to abolish dehumanizing practice. It is relevant to mention that recently the Karnataka high court had expressed serious concern over the recent deaths of two manhole workers and incident of a sweeper committing suicide after being allegedly forced to do manual scavenging. The court passed this order on March 25.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/hc-seeks-govt-response-on-pilon-manual-scavenging-act/articleshow/81712052.cms||---
---||Business||Five Star is unicorn after $234 million round||CHENNAI: The year 2021 has got its fourth unicorn (valued at over $1 billion). Private lender Five Star Business Finance on Friday closed a $234-million funding round that values it as around $1.4 billion. This round by the small business lender was a combination of primary funding from investors including KKR and TVS Capital, and a secondary sale by existing investor Morgan Stanley. Having first invested in the 35-year-old NBFC in 2016, Morgan Stanley has made a full exit with its share (around 12%) being bought out by new investors KKR and TVS Capital. Existing investors Sequoia Capital and Norwest Venture Partners also invested in the round. Currently, promoters hold around 20%, external investors 65% and friends and family circles have roughly 15% stake in the closely held entity. Five Star plans to use the capital to expand its business to meet the funding needs of the small business community who were looking at unorganised money lenders.Taking control of the NBFC in 2002 from a relative, computer science engineer and first-generation entrepreneur D Lakshmipathy steered the company’s focus to SME lending from its core business of auto financing. The company thus became a pioneer in the small business lending space when it was a rarity — a rarity back then — providing collateralised loans based on assessment of borrower’s business and household cash flows. Bringing in a group of finance and banking professionals subsequently, Five Star said it has doubled its asset under management (AUM) for every year in the past four years till Covid hit. Even during the pandemic, the lender said it managed to achieve 100% collections in the month of September even with the moratorium. Five Star lends for all needs of the small business community, fully backed by security, making it a profitable enterprise with a strong asset quality. As of December 2020, the company’s asset under management stood at around Rs 4,000 crore, and with a return on asset of around 6%, it is one of the best-performing players in the segment. “As of December, our gross NPAs stood at around 1.3% and we hope to close the March quarter with an even better position,” Lakshmipathy said. “Our underwriting model has seen various business cycles in the past 15 years, making us uniquely positioned in ground level analysis of small business owners and providing them with funding alternatives,” he added. “The strength of the founder and the management team, along with the credit processes are visible in how the company has navigated several small and large disruptions including demonetization, GST and now Covid-19 related challenges,” Sequoia India MD G V Ravishankar said. Norwest India MD Niren Shah said Five Star has managed to reach 10x of the scale compared to when they first invested in 2017. TVS Capital MD Gopal Srinivasan said, “Five Star has positioned itself as the best-in-class MSME lender in India’s missing middle with supreme operational efficiency, appreciating the on ground realities faced by self-employed own-account enterprises.” The NBFC has scaled to 262 branches across eight states in a completely offline model. It has around 4,000 employees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/five-star-is-unicorn-after-234mn-round/articleshow/81714877.cms||Sindhu Hariharan
---||Business||Ex-deputy RBI governor Chakrabarty had pushed financial inclusion||MUMBAI: Former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) deputy governor Kamalesh Chandra Chakrabarty passed away on Thursday following a heart attack. He was deputy governor between June 2009 and April 2014. He leaves behind his wife and son. As deputy governor, Chakrabarty (68) had actively pushed for consumer protection, financial inclusion, and banking as a fundamental right. He flagged the issue of asset quality in respect of restructured loans long before an asset quality review was undertaken by the central bank. Chakrabarty was the only central banker to publicly raise the issue of the mis-selling of financial products by banks. In his speeches, he spoke about the need to introduce the concept of ‘treating customers fairly’ — something he was familiar with during his tenure as head of Bank of Baroda’s UK operations. A veteran banker, after heading two public sector lenders — Indian Bank and Punjab National Bank — Chakrabarty was appointed as deputy governor, a position reserved for a practising banker. Known for his witticism, Chakrabarty often made news for defending unpopular opinions among bankers. He questioned the banks offering ‘teaser rates’ or ‘festival rates’, asking whether the cost of funds came down during the festival season. He once said that the poor should never purchase gold as an investment because it ends up “either in the temple or with the moneylender or is given away during their daughter’s marriage”. He privately held the view that consumer protection could not be handled by the RBI as it had to protect banks and had said that there was a need for a separate body for bank consumer protection. In 2013, he flayed bankers for hiding stressed loans under the garb of restructuring. “We must move away from restructuring, there should not be any category called restructuring. The moment it is restructured, it should be declared as NPA (non-performing asset),” Chakrabarty had said. His outspokenness did not go well with his colleagues and, in the midst of his tenure as deputy governor, he found himself briefly stripped off all portfolios except Rajbhasha, customer service and information technology. This was after he had made a comment on the RBI’s handling of inflation. He resigned a couple of months before his term ended. Chakrabarty was a rank holder in both his graduation and post-graduation in statistics from the Banaras Hindu University. He went on to get his doctorate in the same field. He came into the limelight in the mid-90s in his bank (Bank of Baroda) taking on the responsibility of analyst presentations after the bank’s initial public offering at a time when public sector banks spoke largely of just their deposit and business numbers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ex-dy-rbi-guv-chakrabarty-had-pushed-fin-inclusion/articleshow/81715183.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Chandigarh||Merits of case not required to be dealt in depth for pre-arrest bail: HC||Chandigarh: The Punjab and Haryana high court has made it clear that at the time of considering the plea of an accused for pre-arrest bail, the merits of the case are not required to be dealt with in-depth. The HC made these observations in a case where a rape accused was seeking anticipatory bail on the grounds that the incident happened a long time back and there was enough evidence to prove that he was not involved in it. “The relevant considerations for grant of anticipatory bail are quite distinct and different from the factors which are to be considered to see whether the accused in a criminal trial is guilty or not. While deciding petitions for pre-arrest bail, the court is required to keep in view the gravity of the offence, the requirement of custodial interrogation of the suspect; the control which can be exercised over the accused, if he is granted pre-arrest bail, chances of such accused absconding or tampering with the prosecution evidence by giving threats or inducement to the prosecution witnesses etc…” the HC has held. Justice H S Madaan passed these orders while dismissing an anticipatory bail plea of a 25-year-old resident of Punjab's Faridkot district. He was accused in an FIR registered on December 7, 2020, for offences under Section 376 (rape) of the IPC and under the Pocso Act registered at city police station Faridkot. As per the complaint given by the girl, around 4-5 years back, when she was around 16, she and the accused used to go to the house of a woman where the accused raped her by giving false allurement of marriage and holding out threats. The local court dismissed the accused’s anticipatory bail plea on February 1, after which he had approached the HC. His counsel contended that allegations in the FIR were wrong, saying the petitioner had never visited the complainant’s village, a fact which is supported by his mobile locations; it is a case of one-sided love in which the petitioner was never the consenting party. The woman has given a statement to the police that the two had never met in her house and that the girl used to talk on the phone with the petitioner/accused, as such he (petitioner) deserves to be granted pre-arrest bail. After hearing the petition, the HC dismissed his plea observing that it is a specific case of the prosecution that the accused raped the girl when she was still a minor by giving her allurement of marriage and threatening her. This is a very grave and serious act on his part.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/merits-of-case-not-required-to-be-dealt-in-depth-for-pre-arrest-bail-hc/articleshow/81714554.cms||Ajay Sura

GFP MLA Vijai Sardesai had moved a private member’s resolution making the recommendations for preventive health check-up under DDSSY in various hospitals which he withdrew after the assurance by the health minister. Sardesai said the UK’s National Health Services (NHS), one of the best healthcare providers in the world, offers preventive health checks for heart ailments and that the Goa government should emulate it. He said a few months ago, a 28-year-old footballer from his constituency collapsed on the ground and died. People suffering from heart disease, not necessarily aged but even young, having hereditary heart ailment can die suddenly even before they have a chance to seek medical help. “In such cases, preventive heart check-ups become important, and so it is included under DDSSY,” he said. Opposition leader Digambar Kamat, independent legislator Rohan Khaunte, NCP MLA Churchill Alemao also spoke in support of the resolution. The health minister, refusing to amend DDSSY to add the procedure to the list of 447 interventions offered under the cashless medical insurance scheme, said their efforts are to strengthen screening facilities provided at primary health centres and community health centres. The “health for all” will be launched in September.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/oppn-pitches-for-health-check-ups-under-ddssy/articleshow/81715436.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

They are taking rest after which they will join back,” he said. Officials said that despite such a high number of Covid-19 cases in its staff, hospital’s functioning will not get hampered due to some measures like postponing post-graduate exams of students which were scheduled to start next week. “Some residents from non-core branches have also been shifted to core branches.

Police authorities are, however, tight-lipped about the loss of weapons and ammunition in the fire, which broke out in one of the illegal huts constructed by constables for living due to non-availability of accommodation for them. “The fire erupted while cooking. Some small cooking cylinders kept inside the huts exploded. Those were used by constables for cooking,” the sources said. When asked, Police Lines DSP Sabir Khan on Friday said details about the number of weapons and ammunition destroyed in the fire could be known only after those constables, to whom they were issued, return from duty and submit a written complaint. “A private vehicle hired for use by the police was also reduced to ashes in the fire. Count of huts damaged would also be known after a written complaint is received from the constables,” he said. Surprisingly, even after 24 hours, no written complaint was submitted with Buddha Colony police station by the authorities concerned. SHO Kaiser Alam said they were waiting for a written complaint in connection with the incident. “Details of losses could be known only after it,” he added. IG (central range) Sanjay Singh said he won’t be able to say anything on the matter. Two years ago, an anti-encroachment drive was launched inside the Police Lines to get rid of illegal hutments and permanent structures. But that remained ineffective. “The problem is that constables don’t have adequate accommodation there. So they construct huts by contributing money. Those who have been transferred keep occupying their places due to links with association leaders or senior police officers,” a source said. He said some old buildings have been demolished in the last few months to construct new buildings. “If the new buildings come up in time, it may solve the problem of space scarcity and illegal constructions inside the Police Lines,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/arms-gutted-in-police-lines-fire-in-patna/articleshow/81713382.cms||---
---||Allahabad||A promising initiative: Farmers of Prayagraj undertake pearl farming||Prayagraj: The Sangam city is on its way to gradually become a hub of pearls, owing to the efforts of the district soil conservation department. The ponds owned by villagers have become breeding grounds of pearls, and this has led to an additional income for the farmers under ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’. Following the efforts of the department, the villagers of Pratappur and Chakka blocks of the district have been involved in this unique farming, in which seeds of the pearls are left in the pond, and after the gestation period of 18 months, bright, shinny pearls are harvested. “We have contacted a Rajasthan-based firm which supplies the seeds at the rate of Rs 40 per seed. The firm also passes the technique for the correct maintenance of the seeds including maintaining the TDS (total dissolved solvent) level, sewage and providing fodder from time to time. When the gestation perion ends, the harvest is purchased by the same firm at the price of Rs 100 per pearl,” said district soil conservation officer, Gaurav Prakash. “Around 20 months ago, the first trial was done at Bhogwara village in Pratappur block of the district, where a villager had released 40,000 pearl seeds in the pond. After 18 months, he sold the produce at Rs 27 lakh in December last year,” informed Prakash. Buoyant by the successful maiden trail, the department has trained 150 women volunteers, many of whom are members of self-help groups (SHGs) working in trans-Yanuma area where there is scarcity of water. “After being trained, Vimla Devi of Arail Uprahaar village of Chakka block has also gotten involved in pearl culture,” informed Praksh The firm, which has signed a contract with the administration, is training and guiding farmers of the district in pearl farming. The farmers are also being trained in sorting pearls as per the size and quality so that they can get a good price for their produce. “Some of the members of SHGs have come forward and are ready to buy the pearls and manufacture jewellery from the same, as this would add to their profit. There is a lot of potential in pearl farming, as finding a pond which is 22 metres by 20 metres in area and three feet deep is not a problem for farmers,” said Prakash. “Presently, China is the biggest producer of these natural pearls. In India, Prayagraj and adjoing districts have huge potential,” he added. The official informed that the seeds are released during two periods of the year, in November-February and in August-October.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/a-promising-initiative-farmers-of-prayagraj-undertake-pearl-farming/articleshow/81712080.cms||---

However, officials of the mines and geology department said they have granted permission for mining coloured granite only after following procedure. Two leases for quarrying coloured granite were granted and executed in favour of MSSS Srinivas for an extent of nine hectares and M Madhupriya for an extent of six hectares, in survey number 323 of Lakshminarayanapuram. Both MSSS Srinivas and M Madhupriya had applied for the granite quarrying leases for a period of 20 years. Speaking to TOI, tehsildar (in-charge), Parvathipuram, G Srirammurthy said locals are opposing granite mining, claiming that it would destroy the temple of Goddess Bodamma and affect rain-fed irrigation on over 200 acres near Bodikonda. The village has been dependendent on resources available on the hill for several decades. “We have observed that the gram panchayat of Lakshminarayanapuram passed a resolution expressing willingness to grant leases to the applicants in 2011. We will examine the complaints as well as the previous documents to submit a report to the district administration in this regard,” he added. Speaking to TOI, assistant director, mines and geology, Vijayalakshmi said the leaseholders would have to submit consent for operation from AP Pollution Control Board before commencing mining activities. Meanwhile, residents of the village have approached the local MLA seeking cancellation of mining operations on the hill.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/locals-call-to-cancel-granite-mining-lease/articleshow/81713444.cms||Nalla.Babu

---||Patna||Patna markets packed up to the hilt with shoppers ahead of Holi||PATNA: Hundreds of shoppers flocked to city markets in the run-up to Holi on Friday. While men and women purchased new clothes, snacks and colours, children coaxed their parents into buying them the fanciest water guns. The two-day festival, which will begin with Holika Dahan on Sunday, marks the arrival of the vibrant spring season. Patna-based priest, Acharya Dinesh Pandey, told this newspaper, “Holika Dahan signifies the triumph of good over evil. Twigs, tree branches, ghee, and cow dung cakes are used for the rituals on the eve of Holi.” It has been a tradition in homemaker Kanti Singh’s family to keep aside all the food items cooked on Chhoti Holi and offer them to the community bonfire in the neighbourhood first. “We eat the food later,” the 46-year-old said. Meanwhile, a large number of Patnaites have decided to shun public gatherings and celebrate Holi indoors due to a sudden spike in the number of Covid-19 cases across the state. Like 2020, Indira Nagar resident Kiran Srivastava has not invited any guests on Holi this year. She claimed, “A lot of people did not take Covid-19 seriously last year. I hope they understand the gravity of the situation this time.” Mahuabagh resident Lalita Singh, who went Holi shopping on Friday, will also celebrate the festival with family and friends. “I have decorated my living room and started cooking snacks for my guests,” she said in a celebratory mood. Meanwhile, the Covid-19 pandemic continues to cast a shadow on vendors and shopkeepers with makeshift stalls in the city. Many of them are reporting fewer customers and poor sales this year. “I have not made any profit yet because of lesser number of customers,” rued Kanhaiya, the owner of a makeshift stall selling water guns, colours and masks in Digha. Another vendor, Anurag Kumar, said, “The prices of supplies like colours and sprinklers have gone up considerably after the Covid-induced lockdown, but people are not willing to pay so much.” Meanwhile, a large number of people, especially youngsters, have switched to online shopping in Covid times, thereby affecting the local traders. Railway Colony resident Seema Verma said, “I ordered herbal colours, curtains, clothes, and decorative items for my house from an online portal in order to avoid the huge rush in city markets.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patna-markets-packed-up-to-the-hilt-with-shoppers-ahead-of-holi/articleshow/81713334.cms||---

Despite the rejection of nomination papers of three JD(U) candidates—Dimi Hasepi (Diphu), Abul Kalam Azad (Jaleswar) and Bornali Baruah (Gauhati East)— during the scrutiny, the party is still in the fight in 34 constituencies. But what has baffled poll analysts is that all of JD(U)’s top leaders, including CM Nitish Kumar, have so far stayed away from campaigning in the Assam polls. The campaigning for the first phase of the three-phase Assam polls ended on March 25.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); Sources said only four JD(U) leaders — rural development minister Shrawan Kumar, northeast in-charge Sanjay Verma, election in-charge for Assam and West Bengal Ramprit Mandal and MLC Gulam Rasool Baliyawi — have campaigned in Assam so far for the first and second phases on March 27 and April 1. The third phase will be held on April 6.

Opposition leaders in Bihar alleged that JD(U)’s top leaders are staying away from campaigning in Assam because of “certain pressure” from BJP, its bigger partner in Bihar. “JD(U)’s Nitish Kumar is running a coalition government in Bihar with support of BJP whereas, in Assam, the BJP-led alliance is in power. If JD(U)’s top leaders go to Assam they might have to speak against the BJP-led government to attract the electors. The JD(U) is working as per the election strategies of the BJP in Assam,” RJD’s spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan told TOI on Friday. JD(U’s national secretary and northeast region in-charge Sanjay Verma rejected the allegations. “There is no pressure from BJP on us. BJP can’t create any pressure on us. Except for Bihar, JD(U) has no alliance with the BJP in any other states. Only a few years back, JD(U) contested elections in Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland where the BJP also was in the contest,” Verma, who returned from Assam recently, told TOI on Friday. JD(U)’s election in-charge of Assam, Baliyawi argued that his party does not have a strong organizational structure in Assam. “We are contesting assembly polls intending to sharpen and spread our organizational base across all regions of Assam,” Baliyawi told TOI on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/assam/why-top-jdu-leaders-are-shying-away-from-campaigning-in-assam/articleshow/81714119.cms||Madan Kumar
---||Patna||As Bihar logs more Covid cases, fewer collegians attend classes||PATNA: Even as the Covid-19 pandemic pushed colleges and universities in the state to drastically reinvent ways of coping with the new normal, most of them are still struggling to resume the academic activities in full swing and bring the students back to classrooms. Academics recall that an immediate and effective response to the crisis was to go digital. Developing robust online platforms had become necessary to offer continuity in learning. But in a state like Bihar with a vast disparity in socio-economic backgrounds of the students and the quality of institutions, the shift was not easy. Former vice-chancellor of Patna University (PU), Rash Bihari Prasad Singh, observed that the Covid-induced lockdown did help a lot of teachers and students take advantage of various online education programmes like ‘SWAYAM’ and ‘MOOCs’. These, however, were beyond the reach of the students residing in remote areas with no cellphones and internet connectivity. “Academic activities on college campuses came to a standstill for nearly a year. Examinations were delayed and research activities took a back seat in many universities,” Singh told this newspaper. Another academic, Shiv Jatan Thakur, claimed that nearly 67% of the students in the state remained deprived of online education. He added, “In the absence of interactive methods of teaching, the quality of education was adversely affected.” PU examination controller R K Mandal, however, pointed out that a positive development during the lockdown was the advent of webinars and conferences on digital platforms. “Now, PhD coursework and viva voce examination are also conducted online,” he said. Meanwhile, classroom attendance of students continues to remain low in PU colleges. Head of the geology department, Atul Aditya Pandey, said, “As the state is grappling with fresh cases, lesser number of students are attending physical classes. The fear of Covid-19 looms large among them.” Hailing the resumption of regular classroom teaching in PU, head of the Hindi department, Tarun Kumar, pointed out that it was a much more effective mode of education in Bihar “that has poor infrastructural facilities for online classes”. He added, “The pandemic has also checked the migration of students from the state to other countries for pursuing their higher education.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/as-bihar-logs-more-covid-cases-fewer-collegians-attend-classes/articleshow/81712824.cms||B K Mishra
---||Chandigarh||Himachal HC marks probe against teacher, husband for ‘major misconduct’||Shimla: Himachal Pradesh High Court, while disposing of a transfer petition, directed the education department to initiate an inquiry against the petitioner and her husband for major misconduct and also imposed a cost of Rs 50,000 upon the petitioner for abusing the court process. The court observed that hopes and aspirations of the country depend on education, therefore, proper and disciplined functioning of educational institutions, particularly teachers, is imperative. It further said that if laws and principles are eroded by teachers themselves, functioning of the institution would be affected adversely and a wrong precedent would be set for students. The division bench, comprising Justice Tarlok Singh Chauhan and Justice Chander Bhusan Barowalia passed these orders on a petition challenging the transfer order dated December 14 last year of the respondent to Government High School (GHS), Jol under Government Senior Secondary School (GSSS) Bhali in Kangra district, where the petitioner, Archana Rana, joined on December 14 last year after being relieved from GHS, Draman (Kangra). The petitioner was promoted from JBT to TGT vide order dated December 7 last year and ordered to be posted at GHS Draman (Kangra) vide order dated December 11 last year. The station of posting was thereafter changed from GHS Draman (Kangra) to GHS Jol. The petitioner submitted before the court that consequent upon her transfer, she was relieved on December 14 last year. On the same day, she joined her new station of transfer, GHS Jol, after submitting her joining and marked attendance as proof of joining. However, during the course of hearing, it was revealed that on December 14 last year, when the Principal, GSSS, Bhali was on official duty, the petitioner, along with her husband, entered his office without permission. Thereafter, the petitioner opened the official table locker and marked her attendance in the teachers’ attendance register. The division bench said the petitioner had candidly admitted before the court that the joining report was made by the petitioner herself and the noting portion regarding her joining service as TGT (Arts) was appended by her husband on the joining report. The court observed that the conduct of the petitioner and her husband is totally unbecoming of the teacher and therefore, they deserve to be chargesheeted for major misconduct. The court also observed that the petitioner did not come to court with “clean hands” and filed a false claim to gain unfair advantage, abusing the process of the court. The court added that it is lamentable when teachers, who are considered equal to God, fall from the highest pedestal to the lowest level by only caring about their self-interest. “Teachers, in our perspective, are men of character, honesty, simplicity and dedication, but both the petitioner and her husband, who happen to be teachers in government school, have not done justice to their roles as ideal teachers,” the court observed, directing them to submit the compliance report on October 5 this year. Court also observed that it has to be remembered that court proceedings are sacrosanct and should not be “polluted by unscrupulous litigants.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/himachal-hc-marks-probe-against-teacher-husband-for-major-misconduct/articleshow/81714604.cms||---

Yadava submitted his report into the incident on Thursday. According to information, the report has suggestions about measures to be taken to avoid such incidents in future. But it did not mention circumstances leading to the incident or officers and staff responsible for it. According to information, a senior IPS officer of Punjab’s intelligence wing had alerted Haryana Police about the plans of Punjab MLAs at 4.50pm. Gupta said he had asked officials to ascertain why information was not circulated in time and to find out the identity of officers responsible for the lapse. “Isnt it a serious lapse? You had information two hours in advance. You should have alerted the CM cell or other agencies, and they would have spruced up arrangements. At least you should have advised (us) to change the venue of press conference from premises to media gallery or committee room of the assembly,” said Gupta. He said they wanted responsibilities to be fixed for the lapses. “We have informed the DGP and would send a written communication to the government as well as the home minister. This will not be tolerated at all,” added Gupta. On March 10, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) MLAs of Punjab assembly allegedly breached the CM’s security when they disrupted a press conference by CM Manohar Lal Khattar. Acting on a complaint by ward and watch officer of Haryana assembly, Chandigarh Police have registered a case at Sector 3 police station. A high level probe by the DGP of Haryana to look into circumstances leading to the incident and identify persons responsible for the lapse. Punjab Police and Haryana assembly security officers too were part of the team which looked into the incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/speaker-not-happy-with-dgps-report-says-fix-responsibility/articleshow/81714602.cms||Manvir Saini
---||Goa||Suggestions on ports bill will be sent to Centre: Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant||PORVORIM: Chief minister Pramod Sawant on Friday assured the House that concerns raised by the members pertaining to the fallout of the Port Authorities Bill and their recommendations will be placed before the Centre. Congress legislator Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco had moved a resolution stating that the bill gives sweeping powers to the Centre, and taking into account the interest of Goa and its people, the House must unanimously resolve to exclude Mormugao port from certain provisions of the bill. “The sections 22 (2), 25 and 26 of the Port Authorities Bill seek to exclude local bodies or government regulations,” Lourenco said, while demanding that Mormugao port be exempted from the application of three provisions of the bill, considering Goa’s small geographical size. Questioning the government over the Nauxi project, Lourenco asked “how the chief minister can say the government will reject the project when the area comes under ports bill”. Lourenco said once the new law comes into force in its present form, it’s not just local bodies and legislations that will have no say but the state will lose revenue. Agreeing on points raised by his colleague, Opposition leader Digambar Kamat said,it is the duty of the state government to inform the Centre that the legislation is not in the interest of Goa. “When I was the chief minister and the Centre proposed SEZs, I went to the Centre and convinced it that Goa’s a small state and people don’t want SEZs. And it was scrapped. Goa is smaller than a district in Karnataka and Maharashtra. It is our duty to protect the interest of the state,” Kamat said. He said the Goa government should oppose the provisions of the bill also due to the possibilities of all major ports being privatised. Lourenco said he was willing to withdraw the resolution provided the government table a separate resolution declaring its intent towards the bill in question, and all opposition members will support it. Sawant stood his ground and said all recommendations of the members of the House will be sent to the Centre, and if he (Lourenco) desires, the draft will be shown to him. The resolution was withdrawn on the assurance of the chief minister, following an almost hour-long discussion on the issue . BJP’s St Andre MLA Francis Silveira and Porvorim MLA Rohan Khaunte also spoke in favour of the resolution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/suggestions-on-ports-bill-will-be-sent-to-centre-cm/articleshow/81715440.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Decide on conjugal rights of jail inmates by May 11: HC||Chandigarh: The Punjab and Haryana high court on Friday asked the Haryana government to address a peculiar issue, as to whether the state has any policy to allow conjugal rights to convicts inside the jail, by May 11. The state has been told to inform the HC on the issue in view of a decision passed by a division bench of the court in 2015, sources said here on Friday. The matter reached the HC in the wake of a petition filed by the wife of a life convict lodged in Gurgaon’s Bhondsi jail. Her husband was convicted in a murder case by a Gurgaon court on May 30, 2018. She has sought directions from the court to have conjugal relations with her husband. Her counsel submitted that the right to procreation is alive even during incarceration of a person in jail. The same can be traced to Article 21 of the Constitution read with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the counsel maintained. The counsel had also referred a case titled Jasvir Singh and another versus state of Punjab in which a question was framed whether penalogical interest of the state permits or ought to permit creation of facilities for the exercise of right to procreation during incarceration and whether said right is termed as ‘right to life’ and ‘personal liberty’ guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution. As per the judgment, the answer appears to be in affirmative, the high court was told. On this, the high court on March 17 had asked the Haryana government whether any policy had been framed by the state government in light of the judgment in Jasvir Singh’s case. When the matter came up for hearing before the court on Friday, the counsel for the Haryana government sought two more weeks to address the court on the issue. The case will now be heard on May 11.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/decide-on-conjugal-rights-of-jail-inmates-by-may-11-hc/articleshow/81714579.cms||---

On Friday the total number of Covid cases in the city rose to 239. Till last week, the numbers were less than 100. “The numbers are increasing at an alarming rate. It will be foolish and suicidal to go for any large-scale Holi celebrations. Our complex has cancelled all prior plans and we have asked residents to stay indoors and celebrate with their family,” said Neeraj Kapoor of Dimple Court housing complex at Shakespeare Sarani. Kapoor said he himself has just come out of a 14-day quarantine after he had acquired the infection earlier this month and at least seven others in the complex are still under treatment. Hansmukh Kundalia of Rameshwaram Complex at Bhowanipore said, last month one person died in the complex of Covid-19 and they are not organising any celebrations this year. “We are even discouraging residents to play Holi in the open and would be distributing leaflets from Saturday,” said Kundalia. At complexes like Greenwood Sonata in New Town and Silver Spring on EM Bypass — posters and pamphlets have already been printed and pasted cautioning residents to avoid playing with colours. However, both the complexes are organising community lunch maintaining safe distance. “We had strictly banned smearing of colours on Holi or Dol this year way before the numbers reached this alarming peak. We will only organise a prabhat pheri inside the complex, followed by a cultural programme and community brunch and packaged lunch,” said Gautam Dasgupta of Power Towers in New Town. Other complexes like South City, Upohar, Urbana, Greenwood Sonata and Merlin Emerald have all cancelled large scale celebrations and have put a complete ban on smearing of colours. “We will restrict ourselves to music, food and adda without playing with colours,” said Sudipta Mukherjee of Greenwood Sonata.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/muted-celebrations-cancelled-events-holi-plans-latest-cov-casualty-at-gated-complexes/articleshow/81713696.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

---||Hyderabad||65% loans granted for Mission Bhagiratha, Kaleshwaram||HYDERABAD: The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) tabled in the state assembly on Friday pointed out that the Telangana government had guarantees to the tune of Rs 77,713 crore by the end of 2018-19, which is 87% of the total revenue receipts of the preceding year (Rs 88,824 crore). The ceiling limit is 90%. The CAG also observed that the Telangana government was providing guarantees to bodies that had not finalised their accounts. Guarantees are given by the state to various state corporations to raise loans from financial institutions. Of the total loans guaranteed by the government, 65% pertained to two special purpose vehicles (SPVs) — Telangana Drinking Water Supply Corporation for the implementation of the flagship project Mission Bhagiratha and to Kaleshwaram Irrigation Project Corporation Limited for implementation of the Kaleshwaram Project. And while the state government was to get guarantee commission of Rs 389 crore from 26 corporations by the end of March 2019, it has received the same only from one state body — the Telangana State Water Resources Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (TSWRIDCL). The CAG also said that the maturity profile of outstanding public debt as of March 2019 showed that 46% (Rs 76,262 crore) was to be paid in the next seven years. The CAG said that under Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, 2005 (amended in 2016), the state also requires to make disclosures and statements, which have not been done in four out of 10 cases. Advising the state to carefully look at the finance accounts of these government bodies, the report stated that by the end of March 2019 Telangana had issued Rs 24,509 crore in loans to autonomous bodies and corporations, of which about 29% ( Rs 6,920 crore) were provided to corporations without any definite stream of revenue of their own for debt servicing. “Thus, such loans do not indicate real worth of government assets,” the CAG report highlighted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/65-loans-granted-for-mission-bhagiratha-kaleshwaram/articleshow/81713708.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

This had resulted in avoidable Rs 8.51 crore burden on the Kaleshwaram corporation. The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) said had the company assessed the specific fund requirements and requested disbursal of funds as per procedure prescribed in the term loan agreement, it could have avoided withdrawal of loan funds of Rs 539.56 crore in a span of two days and depositing such large amounts in savings bank account at a lower interest rate. Government replied (July 2020) due to difficulty in releasing 30% margin money and to utilise construction period (post-monsoon period) consortium banks were requested to release loan in one tranche for total requirement of funds up to March 2018.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kaleshwaram-rs-8-5cr-burden-on-corporation/articleshow/81713699.cms||Koride Mahesh

Two other accused, Shamsher alias Lalu, a resident of Parhav Chowk and Nishan, a resident of Kharia village in Hisar are still to be arrested. Hisar police said that on Thursday, Barwala police station registered a case on the complaint of Gulshan Garg, a resident of Nihal Singh Wala in Moga district of Punjab against four unidentified persons under sections 392 (robbery), 341 (wrongful restraint) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Arms Act. In his police complaint, Garg said he has a shop in Nihal Singh Wala, named Asha Jewelers and he also deals with Ramswaroop Jewelers of Hisar. On Thursday, his employees, Baljit Singh and Manpreet Kaur went to Hisar with 1,560 grams of gold and Rs 25 lakh cash. “In the evening, Baljit called him and said that when they reached near Sarsod Bichpari village in Hisar, his car slowed down near a speed breaker. At this, four youths in a black car drove up and broke the window pane of his car. They took the car into their possession and drove them to a link road, where they held him at gunpoint and robbed him of gold, cash and mobile phones. However, they threw the mobile phones away when they fled,” he said. After this, he came to the police station with his son and lodged a complaint. A team formed under the leadership of Barwala DSP Rohtash Singh arrested the five accused with the help of cyber cell personnel. During interrogations, Naresh named Shamsher alias Lalu as the mastermind of the robbery, the DSP said. “Naresh confessed that Ankit, employee of Ramswarup Jewellers is known to him and he told him to inform whenever a big party came to the shop. When Baljeet and Manpreet came, Ankit informed him,” he said, adding that the remaining accused would be arrested soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/1560g-gold-rs-25-lakh-cash-looted-from-jewellery-store-staff-5-held/articleshow/81714618.cms||---

From initial questioning of the injured accused Ankesh, it appears that not all of the men who came to the hospital were aware that the plan was to free Kuldeep Maan alias Fajja from custody, said police. Ankesh purportedly told the cops that they were informed that they had to secure GTB Hospital as there could be a bid on Fajja’s life by rival gangster Tillu Tajpuria. However, it was only midway that two of the gang members, including Ravi Malik, the deceased, allegedly spoke to Sandeep on Viber call from Dubai, which was routed through Bangkok, and were informed that the plan was to free Fajja. Police are looking into the initial claims made by the accused. Malik from Rohtak was also involved in a murder case registered in Haryana. Police said his family members claimed that he was 19 years old. Ankesh underwent a surgery on Friday. Investigating officials revealed that Ankesh of Mundka has around a dozen cases registered against him, including murder and attempt to murder.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/gtb-gunfight-not-all-gang-members-aware-of-plan/articleshow/81714626.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||Tax from excise touched Rs 10,000 cr||Hyderabad: Efficiency in collection of major taxes in the state has remained almost constant with respect to taxes on vehicles, and stamps and registration, even as it reported an improvement in tax collection on sales, trade, State Goods and Services Tax and excise, stated the Controller and Auditor General (CAG) report. Interestingly, excise collection, that stood at Rs 2,000 crore when the state was formed, touched Rs 10,000 crore in 2018-19. The efficiency in collection is measured in terms of cost of collection as a percentage of the gross revenue collection. The report made key observations on capital expenditure. The burden of the committed expenditure, measured as a percentage of revenue expenditure of the state, which was steadily rising during the previous years, has declined by 6% from 61% in 2017-18 to 55% in 2018-19. “There was increase in interest payments (16%), subsidies (2%) and salaries (1.5%). Pension payments, on the other hand, decreased by 4%,” the report stated. The CAG said excess expenditure of Rs 29,133 crore was made on certain accounts, with an expenditure of Rs 3,507 crore incurred without any budget provision in 34 cases. “Persistent excess expenditure occurred in fiscal administration, planning, surveys and statistics and home administration grants,” it said. “This vitiates the system of budgetary and financial control and encourages financial indiscipline in management of public resources”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/tax-from-excise-touched-rs-10000-cr/articleshow/81713711.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The report said the government has deviated from its own guidelines and ineligible students benefited. The report said every year 300 eligible backward caste students pursuing post graduate and PhD courses are given Rs 20 lakh in two instalments towards fees and living expenses. Audit of the scheme in June 2019 showed that the department deviated from the guidelines to provide scholarship of Rs 1.90 crore to 18 students (out of 749 cases where scholarships were granted) who did not meet the eligibility criteria. “The scheme was introduced in October 2016 and was applicable for students who were admitted from fall session of 2016-17. However, six applicants, who joined PG courses prior to introduction of the scheme were sanctioned scholarships as special cases,” the report said. It added, “Second, scholarship was sanctioned to one applicant for Kyrgyzstan as a special case during 2017-18 although the country was not in the list of admissible countries for grant of scholarship and five applicants who had already completed their first post-graduate abroad were sanctioned scholarships for pursuing second post-graduate Course (apart from humanities) as special cases.” It further said, “Five applicants were paid full scholarship amount in contravention of government orders restricting financial assistance depending on duration of the course.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cag-picks-holes-in-bc-scholarships/articleshow/81713726.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Delhi||Two die while cleaning septic tank in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Two men died apparently due to asphyxiation while cleaning a septic tank at a banquet hall in east Delhi’s Patparganj Industrial Area on Thursday night. Police detained the hall’s owner and two employees on Friday and registered a case while also invoking the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and Their Rehabilitation Act. Around 10.23pm on Thursday, police received a call reporting the death of two men at the Pearl Grand Emperor banquet hall. Prem Chand, 40, and Lokesh Kumar, 35, both residents of Trilokpuri in east Delhi, had been called at 7.30pm to clean a septic tank by Rahul, who is in charge of the housekeeping there. TimesViewIn 2014, the Supreme Court prohibited anyone from working in sewers, which are often filled with lethal gas. Stepping into them is permitted only in case of emergency, that too after putting on adequate safety gear, as per union government rules. These include facemask, goggles, gumshoes and the presence of an ambulance on the spot. Yet, these rules are seldom followed. Last month, the union government admitted in the Lok Sabha that in the past five years, 340 workers have died cleaning sewers and septic tanks. Those responsible for the deaths in east Delhi must be held accountable and punished. As activist Bezwada Wilson once said, “These are not deaths but killings”.As reported, Rahul came to check on the two men two hours later only to find them non-responsive. He called police and reported the matter to Jimmy Arora, the banquet hall owner. According to Deepak Yadav, DCP (East), after receiving the call, a police team, firemen and personnel from Delhi Disaster Management Authority and MCD Boat Club went to the site and retrieved the bodies from the tank, which were then sent to Lal Bahadur Shastri Hospital for postmortem examination. “Prima facie it appears they died of asphyxiation, but we are awaiting the autopsy report,” said Yadav. “A case has been registered under the Indian Penal Code Section 304A for causing death due to negligence and under Section 9 of the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavenger and Their Rehabilitation Act against unknown persons. Arora, Rahul and banquet hall general manager Amir Khan have been detained for questioning.” Police informed that Kumar was survived by his wife, 15-year-old daughter and 12-year-old son, while Chand left behind his wife and two sons aged 16 and 9 years. The kin of the deceased who had gathered at the hospital alleged the two men had been forced to go into the septic tank else their payment would be withheld. “They weren’t given any safety gear. The two men had never earlier cleaned septic tanks because they worked as waiters,” said Radhey Shyam, Chand’s elder brother, a security guard. Amit Kumar said his cousin Lokesh was the only earning member in the family. “His parents and four other brothers live in Shimla. I got information about his passing away at 1am and rushed to the banquet hall,” he added. He also said that Lokesh did not normally clean sewers or septic tanks and had been forced to do so, leading to his death. “We want the immediate arrest of the accused. The two deceased men have left behind children who are young and need support,” he demanded. The families of the two men added that they had only received information about the deaths in the morning. Police officers explained that the bodies hadn’t been identified till after some time post the incident. “The banquet hall owner also could not give us any information about the victims. It was much later that their identities were established,” claimed a police officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/two-die-while-cleaning-septic-tank/articleshow/81714653.cms||---

The deceased has been identified as Hariom of Raipur Jattan village in Karnal district. Police said Hariom was a Class IV government employee posted in Karnal. He consumed poison on Wednesday and succumbed during treatment the next day. He also recorded a video in which he blamed unidentified persons for forcing him to take the extreme step. He said in the video that his body should be given to his second wife. However, this did not stop his relatives from bickering over who should take possession of the body. A woman from Karan Vihar, who claimed to be his second wife, demanded possession saying that he had been living with her for the past 12 years. She said they got married in a gurdwara one and a half years ago. On the other hand, family members of the deceased maintained that the first wife had the legal right to his body as he had not divorced her. Finally, police handed over the body to the biological mother and his first wife. This led to a scuffle between the woman claiming to be second wife of the deceased and women police personnel, who were trying to pacify her. Karnal SP Ganga Ram Punia said the body had been handed over to the family members of the deceased as the first wife had the legal right to his body. He said the second wife failed to produce any documents proving her relationship with the deceased. He added that a case of abetment to suicide had been registered against unknown persons, as he did not mention any name in the video.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/man-commits-suicide-kin-fight-over-body/articleshow/81714625.cms||---

So far, 10.58 lakh people have been vaccinated. “The Centre has appreciated the state government for effectively controlling the coronavirus cases,” he said and added that during the pandemic and lockdown, his government continued welfare measures. On AIMIM legislators’ request to increase Muslims quota to 12 per cent, KCR said increasing reservations may not be possible at this stage as the matter is sub judice. “Tamil Nadu has been implementing 69 per cent reservations and the Supreme Court put a cap of 50% reservations. We have informed the Centre to give powers to the states to increase reservations locally based on the population,” he said. He said his government would bring Metro Rail to the Old City while taking potshots at the AIMIM MLAs. The CM said integrated vegetarian and non-veg market complexes will be constructed at various places within 6-7 months. The government would also take a decision on notarised properties in the city soon, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cm-rules-out-fresh-lockdown-says-closure-of-edu-institutions-temporary/articleshow/81713741.cms||Koride Mahesh

During interrogation on Friday, she confessed to her crime. The woman is identified as Manorma. The body of the child was found in the water tank at the house of Manorma’s father. Initially, Manorma accused her two elder sisters and father for killing her son. However, during interrogation she accepted her crime, said police. As per reports, one Dharmendra Singh of Gagha area along with his wife Manorma, daughter Ananya and son Aniket went to his in-laws’ place in Belipar area on Tuesday. On Wednesday morning, Manorma told everyone in the house that her son Aniket had gone missing. The police started looking for the boy, and found his body in the water tank on Wednesday. Manorma, on Thursday, accused her father, Anand Swaroop Singh aka Andhan Singh, and two elder sisters, Shashi and Vandana, of killing her son. Later, on the complaint filed by Dharmendra Singh, an FIR was lodged against Manorma’s father and sisters. Police also called Manorma for interrogation, during which she was constantly changing her statements. When the police further interrogated her sternly, she confessed that she had killed her son. She told police that on Tuesday night, she threw her son in the water tank of the house and closed the lid. She further said that she was not in favour of a second child, and took medicines to abort the child. However, the baby didn’t die in the womb, but he was born mentally weak and also had difficulty in hearing. It was very difficult for her to look after him, she said. Manorma’s elder sister Shashi told police that she had heard a sound on Tuesday night when Manorma threw Aniket in the tank, but neither she nor anyone else saw Manorma doing the same or coming down from the terrace. In the morning, she started telling everyone that her son was missing, said Shashi. “A case has been registered against Manorma under Section 302 (murder) of the IPC. She is in our custody and other legal actions are underway,” said inspector Upendra Kumar Mishra of Belipar police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/mother-kills-her-differently-abled-baby-boy-in-gorakhpur/articleshow/81714503.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala assembly polls 2021: CM will remain captain, says Sitaram Yechury||THRISSUR: CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury has practically put to bed rumours that there will be a change of guard in the state if LDF wins the assembly elections. In an interview with TOI on Friday, he gave adequate hints that Pinarayi Vijayan will continue as the chief minister. “The incumbent chief minister is leading the campaign. He has been treated as the captain by the people. The captain will remain the captain in the future, no? But formally, that will be decided after the elections,’’ he said. “Our first task is to win the elections. Once that is won, automatically the other issues will be taken care of,’’ Yechury added. Asked about the decision to drop some of the senior leaders in this election, even when the front’s major plank was continuity of government, he said: ``That has been the case always in the CPM, there will be continuity with a change. We stick to the principle that only two consecutive terms should be allowed for candidates. The whole country was saying that I have been denied the third term as the Rajya Sabha member earlier, when I myself had said my two terms are over, and I’m the party general secretary, and the decision to which I’m party to, should not be broken in my case also. We apply this yardstick everywhere, that will not be a problem for the return of the LDF to power in Kerala.” On the opinion polls predicting landslide victory for the LDF in Kerala, and not very impressive results for the CPM-led front in West Bengal, he said opinion polls are opinion polls after all. “But the opinion polls have predicted a massive win for the LDF in Kerala, because that is the general mood of the people in Kerala now. In West Bengal, the opinion polls now say it will be a three-cornered fight. Earlier, it was a binary fight between BJP and Trinamool Congress. Slowly, it is happening, it is an eight-stage election, which will go on till the end of April. So much water still has to flow through the Ganga, there will be a lot of things that will change, in the coming days.” He said the Election Commission has given a strange reason for the deferment of Rajya Sabha elections in Kerala, some reference from the Centre. If it is such a major reference, let the commission make it public, but it has not done so. That raises the suspicion that the decision has been taken under pressure. Once the election process is set in motion, not even the judiciary interferes, he said. On the alliance between Congress and CPM in West Bengal and the bitter fight between the two parties in Kerala, he said, “In India that has always been the case everywhere, the specificities in each state determine the nature of political combine there. In 2004, out of the 61 members elected to the Lok Sabha, 57 had gone to the Lok Sabha by defeating the Congress. But then, we supported the Manmohan Singh government, for 10 years. The principle objective is to ensure that BJP is not able to come to power in any of the states which are going to polls now.’’ According to him the outcome of the polls in the five states will shatter the so-called “electoral invisibility of the BJP.” These outcomes will be a weapon in the hands of the opposition, the people, particularly the struggling sections like the farmers, the working class, and the youths demanding employment, to put pressure on the government to respond, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cm-will-remain-captain-says-yechury/articleshow/81713749.cms||T Ramavarman

According to the Nature Index 2020-2021 — an international indicator of high quality research in the natural and physical sciences (includes chemistry, life sciences, earth and environmental sciences) — the central university raced past 122 other varsities to claim the number one position. The research work published by UoH between December 1, 2019 and November 30, 2020, tracked by Nature Index, was considered for the ranking. “Receiving additional funding under the institution of eminence mandates that we have a presence in the top ranked institutions and, therefore, we have to benchmark our output with the top 100 performers globally. In accordance with the government of India’s directives, we are setting out to do what is mandated under the IoE,” said professro Appa Rao Podile, vice-chancellor, UoH, speaking about the university’s achievement. In overall performance, though, UoH slipped three spots to stand 18th among all educational and research institutions while the Indian Institute of Sciences, Bengaluru topped the list. The university received a count of 54 and a share of 14.72 in the Nature Index, which are parameters to judge number of citations and collaborated work done by the faculty members of the institution. “For UoH, the index is crucial because it indicates our global research standing. It also benchmarks us against the nation’s best. The visibility to researchers who are counted in terms of Nature Index is enormous,” said Pramod Nayyar, director, Institution of Eminence Committee, UoH.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/uoh-beats-122-varsities-claims-top-spot-in-research-again/articleshow/81713750.cms||---

He was supposed to return to jail on completion of the bail tenure, but absconded. According to DCP (crime) Bhisham Singh, the accused, Gajender Nayyar, had been granted interim bail during the exercise to decongest jail in the wake of the novel coronavirus pandemic. “Nayyar was arrested in 2011 for giving fake medical certificates to Tihar inmates, which were used in securing bail. Over 65 inmates got bail based on his reports. He was arrested this time from Aakash Hospital, Dwarka,” the DCP added. Nayyar, an MBBS pass-out from Maulana Azad Medical College, had flourishing practice for decades. However, he got into bad company and started providing fake certificates for criminals, police said. The Crime Branch started tracking him after he was declared a “proclaimed offender” by a court. The cops were tipped off about his movement in Dwarka by a source. “The team also learnt that he was not attending the court in another case of cheating and was declared a proclaimed offender by the Rohini courts,” the DCP said. Based on the tip-off, a team led by ACP Arvind conducted a raid and nabbed the accused from the hospital. The accused has also been involved in a case of cheating lodged in RK Puram police station in 2008, apart from two cases of Crime Branch and one in Prashant Vihar. The jail authorities have been apprised of his arrest. Police are investigating his plans and associates along with the reason behind his escape. During questioning following his arrest, Nayyar told the cops that he did not want to return to jail owing to his age and wanted to be a free man.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/fake-certificates-doc-who-jumped-bail-held/articleshow/81714681.cms||---
---||Delhi||DMRC Turns Clock Back To Save Costs||New Delhi: A two-decade-old analog clock, the automatic fare collection (AFC) gate through which the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee entered Kashmere Gate station using a smart card to board the maiden train on Delhi Metro’s first corridor from Shahdara to Tis Hazari in 2002, an assortment of ancient-looking walkie-talkies, display boards and other equipment of different vintage, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation’s (DMRC) state-of-the-art AFC and telecom repair lab in Chawri Bazaar can easily pass off as a museum. This repository of memories, however, is not only helping DMRC give a new lease of life to some of its oldest equipment, but also saving more than Rs 60 crore every year through in-house repair and indigenous modules used in AFC gates and telecom systems. A DMRC spokesperson said the lab was established in 2005 at Shastri Park train depot to provide repair solutions of AFC and telecom equipment and reduce dependency on the base manufacturer. This minimised expenditure with a self-reliant approach. With the network expanding over the years, the new centre was opened at Chawri Bazaar Metro Station. At the lab, repair and testing of various faulty modules received from different corridors is carried out. This exercise is helping save Rs 25 crore every year. DMRC is also redesigning and modifying AFC modules to improve the working of the system and reduce chances of faults. “DMRC is also carrying out indigenisation of various AFC system modules to cut costs, develop local support and promote Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan. The lab has indigenised about 20 AFC modules, saving approximately Rs 5 crore every year,” the spokesperson said. There are three sections at the lab and, apart from the repair and testing section that receives 40 modules on average every day for repair and rectifies 80% of these on the same day, there is also the AFC simulator room and software development centre. The simulator room has archived all kinds of AFC gates and other equipment that have been used in the DMRC network since its inception. “To simulate a station-level environment and provide practical training to signalling and operation staff, there is equipment of different versions of AFC gates, ticket office machines, ticket vending machines, station computers, etc,” said the official. The telecom repair lab sees repair and testing of various faulty modules and Rs 8 crore is saved annually. It has also indigenised about 12 different telecom modules. It provides hands-on training to new inductees and refreshers courses to give practical exposure to employees, apart from repair of IT system modules.

During investigation, police found that Surendra was reportedly killed by the abductors even before the ransom demand of Rs 20 lakh was made, as one of the suspects wanted to “eliminate” him for objecting to his relations with his (Surendra) sister. All the four accused — Bhupendra (a distant relative of the deceased), Shivkumar, Ratan Singh and Rahul Singh -- have been remanded in judicial custody. Police also recovered the deceased’s body, which was buried by the suspects in Mathura in a bid to destroy evidence. Police said that during interrogation, Bhupendra told police that his friend Shivkumar had a relationship with Surendra’s sister. Recently, the victim had overheard his sister talking to Shivkumar over phone, which he objected to and warned him to stay away from her. Though Shivkumar then promised him not to call her again, he was quite perturbed about the incident. Shivkumar reportedly narrated the entire incident to his friend Bhupendra, who made a plan to abduct Surendra and invited him to a liquor party in the evening. Once Surendra became drunk, the suspects strangled him with a scarf and buried him near the Yamuna river in Mathura. The accused, after killing Surendra, later used the latter's phone to make a ransom call to the family, in a bid to make his disappearance look like a kidnapping case. Circle officer Vikas Kumar told TOI that police have recovered Surendra’s ID card from the crime spot. An FIR has been registered against the four accused under sections 364 A, 302 and 201 IPC at Khair police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/4-men-killed-aligarh-student-for-objecting-to-his-sisters-affair-with-one-of-them/articleshow/81712908.cms||---
---||Pune||Students seek grace marksbased on 2019 performance||Pune: Students excelling in sports, art and music have applied to the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education to consider their performances from standard IX or standard XI for awarding grace marks in the board examinations. They said there were very few opportunities last year to showcase their talent in the respective categories so the performance from the previous years be considered for grace marks. Students are eligible for 25 grace marks depending on their level of performance from district to the international level. State board officials said the proposal is with the respective directorates for a decision and based on their verdict the marks would be awarded. About 1.8 lakh students in Maharashtra have got grace marks for excelling in extra curricular activities with 40,355 students from Pune division alone. Athlete Aditya Kale said, “We have had no events last year and I have been participating in sports events for four years, and have also been at the national level. Last year, I won a medal. So, all my efforts will go in vain as 2020 was unusual and there was not a single tournament held. We must get the benefit of our efforts from the previous years.” Due to Covid-19, many events were organised in the later half of 2020 and many events that were organised were also cancelled due to a spike in the cases. Even music exams and other such culture exams were affected. Gymnast Sayali Purohit said, “We have been participating in various events and if we cannot be awarded marks based on 2020 our previous performance should be taken into consideration. It will be unfair if the government decides to eliminate the rule this year due to Covid-19 because most students who are practising extra-curricular activities seriously have been doing it for a minimum of two years and more.” Football coach Faiyaz Shaikh said, “Students need encouragement especially in such times. There can be little exception to the rules which the state government may study and review for the benefit of the students and keep in mind their efforts in extra-curricular over a period of time.” When contacted, state board chairman Dinkar Patil, said, “We have submitted the proposals to the respective directorates like sports, art and culture for a decision. The grace marks were introduced by the respective departments so they need to decide about the unusual circumstances students have faced. We will implement their decision.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/students-seek-grace-marksbased-on-2019-performance/articleshow/81713809.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

Farmers observed Bharat Bandh on Friday to mark completion of four months of their agitation against the three new central farm laws. Six trains were delayed, 10 were cancelled and four had to be diverted due to the 12-hour agitation. However, traffic movement at the Ghazipur border as well as other areas remained affected. Deepak Kumar, chief public relation officer of Northern Railway, said, “Barring a limited number of trains in Punjab and Haryana, the bandh had almost zero impact overall.” Kumar added that trains were running smoothly after 6pm. Among the trains cancelled were primarily Shatabdi Express, headed towards interiors of Punjab or Haryana. Officials said the agitation was largely peaceful with no damage reported anywhere. A railway official said that 32 blockades were reported from various locations outside Delhi in Punjab and Haryana till 9am, however this number did not exceed 35 by the time the bandh was called off at 6pm.

---||Delhi||Court allows cops to search northeast Delhi riots lawyer’s premises||NEW DELHI: The hands of investigators cannot be tied to prevent them from collecting evidence. This was stated by a city court while allowing police to carry out a search at the premises of advocate Mahmood Pracha, who had sought modification of an order through which the search warrant had been obtained. Chief metropolitan magistrate Pankaj Sharma in an order on March 25 said, “The collection of evidence is intrinsic to the investigation. The collection of data from its source is done to ensure its admissibility during trial. It is imperative for the investigating officer to collect the best form of evidence.” Terming Pracha’s objections “baseless”, the court added, “Let the search warrant be executed in accordance with the law, subject to safeguards as per the expert opinion.” In August 2020, a probe was ordered by a sessions court on the allegations of forgery and false deposition by a complainant, apparently on the “instigation by a senior bar member”. In December, Pracha’s premises were raided. On March 10, judge Sharma stayed the search warrant after Pracha said neither had he been intimated nor served with the warrant. The lawyer volunteered to provide the identified computers for collection of evidence before the court and the IO could obtain whatever was permitted in the court’s presence. His plea added that this would curtail “any mischief” and also ensure “that the object of the search warrant was satisfied”. On March 12, the court directed Delhi Police to file a reply stating how it proposed to receive data for which searches were conducted without interference or revealing the data related to Pracha’s other clients. It was noted that the hard disk, for which the search warrant was issued, also contained data pertaining to other clients and confidentiality needed to be maintained. The data was generated in the course of advocate-client privilege relationship and formed part of privileged communication under Section 126 of Indian Evidence Act. However, on March 25, judge Sharma observed, “The plea of the applicant about his offer of giving target data in a pen drive can only be considered by the IO subject to the issue of admissibility and court’s intervention. It is not proper and the accused cannot dictate the IO about the mode and manner for collection of evidence in an investigation.” “The situation is different in this matter as the data is to be collected by police on account of investigation in a criminal case. The plea for non-sharing of data of other clients is beyond the scope of Section 126 of Indian Evidence Act,” the court added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-allows-cops-to-search-ne-riots-lawyers-premises/articleshow/81714726.cms||---

---||Pune||No need of President’s Rule in state: Deputy CM||Pune: Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Friday said the situation in the state did not warrant imposition of President’s Rule. Pawar said this in reference to BJP leaders’ demand for imposition of President’s Rule in the state following the arrest of polce officer Sachin Waze in connection with the recovery of an explosives-laden vehicle near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s house and IPS officer Param Bir Singh’s corruption allegations against state home minister Anil Deshmukh. After CM Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday asked him to prepare a report on alleged illegal tapping by IPS officer Rashmi Shukla in her capacity as state intelligence commissioner last year, chief secretary Sitaram Kunte on Thursday submitted a report to Thackeray stating that Shukla had “misled” the state while seeking permission for phone-tapping. “The report submitted by Kunte is clear and presents all facts,” Pawar said. “(BJP leader) Sudhir Mungantiwar and the opposition have been insisting on President’s Rule in the state. But the situation in the state does not warrant President’s Rule,” he said, adding that MVA coalition had the support of 165 MLAs and enjoyed majority in the Assembly. On the death of 10 patients at a Covid-19 hospital in Bhandup, Mumbai, Pawar said he has instructed officials to ensure such incidents did not occur again.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/no-need-of-presidents-rule-in-state-deputy-cm/articleshow/81713833.cms||---
---||Pune||Most Covid patients in Pune hospitals recover without oxygen support||PUNE: Most newly diagnosed Covid-19 patients in the city are recovering without oxygen support, private hospitals TOI spoke to have confirmed. Representatives of the private hospitals said 40% of the hospitalized patients were currently requiring oxygen support as against 80% during the initial phases of the pandemic. Some of the circulating strains of the SARS-CoV-2 could be less virulent leading to a mild infection in most cases, experts said. Infectious diseases expert Parikshit Prayag of Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital said, “During the initial days of the pandemic, almost 80% patients were on oxygen support as against 40-50 % now. We will need further studies about the strain to see if this is less virulent.” Ruby Hall Clinic’s chief intensivist, Kapil Zirpe, said, “This peak involves more younger patients below 45 years of age. Morbidity and mortality have been less. Besides, the circulating strain seems to have lesser virulence with high infectivity rate.” He said. “Most symptomatic patients are coming early and seeking timely consultation and admission. A better understanding of the disease process and treatment by the medical fraternity is also one of the major treatment determinants.” Critical care expert Urvi Shukla of Symbiosis Medical College and Hospital is of the same view, “There is lesser need for oxygen support among patients in this surge as compared to last year’s. Most of the patients seem to be responding to steroids and remdesivir (anti-viral).” “Covid is a mild disease in most patients. Among those coming to the hospital with a computer tomography (CT) scan of the chest suggestive of pneumonia, a lot of patients are not needing oxygen. We know that the strain this time around is more fitter — spreads rapidly but is less dangerous. Besides, with research conducted across the world, there is much more clarity on the treatment options to be adopted. This helps with more definitive and effective therapy,” she said. Patients across all age groups are recovering without oxygen support. “It is only in a small fraction of patients, irrespective of their age, that the illness is critical. The real problem is that no one can predict who will have a mild disease and who will get a severe form of disease. That’s why everyone needs to protect themselves,” said Shukla, who is also the hospital's chief intensivist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/most-covid-patients-in-hosps-recover-without-o2-support/articleshow/81713855.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Pune||PMC set to increase property tax for new constructions||PUNE: The civic body will increase the annual rateable value of new properties to be registered after April 1 this year, which would result in higher property tax for their owners. “The hike is only 5% in the base price and will not affect the old properties,” Vilas Kanade, head of the Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) property tax department, said. The annual rateable value (ARV) is a base price, on the basis of which the property tax is calculated. The tax is calculated in proportion to the size of the property. The hike will be for residential as well as commercial properties. The PMC has made 53 divisions of the civic limits and the ARV has been finalized on the basis of the ready reckoner rates of the areas in the regions. The rates for the residential areas range from Rs2.25 to Rs3.67, while that for the commercial establishments range from Rs6 to Rs9.5, which would be increased by 5%. Kanade said the hike has been kept low in view of the current market scenario. As per the PMC data, 10.6 lakh properties are in the property tax net, which include properties as well as open plots. Property tax is one of the biggest sources of income for the PMC. On an average around Rs1,600 crore to Rs1,700 crore are collected from property tax. The PMC is hoping to generate more revenue after the merger of 23 villages in the civic limits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-set-to-increase-property-tax-for-new-constructions/articleshow/81713853.cms||---

Administrator Astik Kumar Pandey issued the order while appealing to citizens to abstain from large gatherings during Holika Utsav on Sunday, followed by Dhulivandan on Monday. Pandey said that the restrictions are being imposed to check further spread of Covid infection, which has already claimed several lives. He warned of action against those found violating the order, under relevant sections of The Epidemic Diseases Act 1897. Aurangabad district collector Sunil Chavan, during a video-conferencing on Friday, briefed chief minister Uddhav Thackeray about the situation in Aurangabad. With the positivity rate crossing the 25% cent mark, Chavan is said to have expressed serious concern over the rising number of patients during the conference. “We want citizens to cooperate so that things return to normalcy at the earliest. Failing to follow the norms or avoiding face masks and social distance are the main reasons for the rapid rise in the number of cases in the district,” Chavan said after the conference. City commissioner of police Nikhil Gupta reiterated that following the district administration’s decision of lockdown on weekends, police will take action against those found stepping out of homes on Saturday or Sunday without valid or emergency reasons. The officer said that restrictions on gathering of large crowds in the city are already in place and that the same will continue on other days of the week until further orders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/curbs-on-holi-celebrations-at-public-places-in-aurangabad/articleshow/81712328.cms||---

But, the exam timetable for the remaining courses will be out in a few days. However, for programmes like an undergraduate course in law, where the admissions process is still going on, the timetable will be released later, officials said. “We announced the examination for some faculties on Thursday. For courses such as law where the admission process is still on, we need to comply with the University Grants Commission (UGC) circular which stipulates 90 days of education or something equivalent, before proceeding with the examinations. The students can get all the timetables on SPPU’s official website under the examination tab’s timetable option,” Mahesh Kakade, director of examination and evaluation at SPPU, said. The first semester examinations for all the years will be conducted from April 10 online in a multiple-choice-question (MCQ) format of one-hour duration for 50 marks. Sixty MCQs will be given, of which correct answers to 50 questions will be considered. While students of conventional courses such as BA, BSc and BCom will be asked questions on 100% syllabus, professional college students will be asked questions on 70% of the syllabus. Kakade said, “Backlog examinations, as well as regular exams for certain students of the old syllabus as well as ME electives, will be conducted at the college level. The schedule of these examinations will be uploaded on the website of the respective colleges and not by the university.” While the results of the first semester examinations will be announced online by the university, the mark sheets will not be given to the students.

---||India||India can’t be capital of illegal migrants, govt tells SC, justifies move on Rohingya||NEW DELHI: The Centre on Friday told the Supreme Court that India could not be the capital of illegal migrants from across the world, while justifying the detention of Rohingya Muslims in Jammu for proposed deportation to Myanmar. The Centre also said it was not within the court’s “domain to dictate” to the Centre about its foreign relations. The court was hearing the plea of a Delhi-based Rohingya Muslim, who had earlier unsuccessfully sought its intervention to stop deportation of his brethren from Assam, citing genocide in Myanmar. Advocate Prashant Bhushan, who was representing the person, read out a judgment of the International Court of Justice indicting the Myanmar military junta for alleged genocide of Rohingya in Rakhine province since 2016-17. “When we know that they face extermination in Myanmar at the hands of the military, which has now usurped power through a coup, how could India not respect the right to life and human rights of Rohingya and push them into Myanmar?” he asked. The UN special rapporteur too wanted to intervene in support of Bhushan’s client and pointed out that conventions bound India to provide shelter to the persecuted Rohingya. But solicitor general Tushar Mehta for the Centre and senior advocate Harish Salve for J&K opposed the rapporteur’s intervention and convinced the bench led by CJI S A Bobde not to hear the rapporteur’s counsel CU Singh, who insisted on assisting the court. Bobde said, “You can assist when we seek it. At present, we do not want to hear you.” Mehta and Salve said India was not a signatory to the Refugee Convention and hence, Bhushan’s argument of non-refoulement did not hold legal weight. Mehta said, “The MHA in an affidavit has told SC that continued stay of Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar in India is absolutely illegal and has serious national security ramifications.” When Bhushan alleged that detention of 150 Rohingyas in Jammu was illegal and so was the proposal for their deportation, Mehta said the government was proceeding in accordance with the Foreigners Act and it would not deport anyone unless Myanmar confirmed their identity as their citizen. Bhushan said India should not believe what Myanmar says as that country had been indicted by the ICJ for genocide of Rohingya. Mehta and Salve said, “It is not within the domain of the SC to dictate to the government of India as to what kind of relationship or trust it should have with other nations.” The bench agreed. It reserved its order on the application argued by Bhushan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-cant-be-capital-of-illegal-migrants-govt-tells-sc-justifies-move-on-rohingya/articleshow/81716923.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

---||Kochi||Corp faces challenge from contractors||Thiruvananthapuram: The civic body which has failed to submit all treasury bills by March 23 as per the plan is now facing new challenge from corporation contractors who are pressing the civic body to give them the present market rate for bitumen. With the corporation ruling council and works standing committee not being considerate towards their demands, the contractors are an irked lot. They have submitted a letter to mayor Arya Rajendran citing their demands. According to corporation contractors, the market rate of bitumen is much more than the estimate rate of their works. They said that despite a government order being in effect that approves the cost difference, the corporation officials have not taken a positive stand on the issue. The civic body undertakes over 500 road works which include construction, repair, patch work, concrete laying and so on. They are also demanding market rate for steel. “We are unable to carry out works at such low rates. The corporation is unwilling to heed to our genuine demands,” a contractor said. The corporation officials said that such cost difference has not been implemented in any of the civic bodies and city corporation cannot give an exception. The contractors however cite examples of local bodies which have implemented the government order and approved the cost difference. The estimate has fixed the rate of bitumen at Rs 30,000 per metric tonne while the current market rate has gone up to Rs 48,000 per metric tonne. In the previous fiscal, mounting bills from civil works amounting to nearly Rs 26 crore coupled with fund crunch of the state government had pushed the civic body into a state of bother as the ruling council found it hard to convince contractors to grab works before the end of the present fiscal. Bills were pending for works undertaken as spill over during 2018-19 and works being executed under plan fund for 2019-20. The demand from contractors has added crisis for corporation which has not even crossed 60% in plan expenditure with less than a week to go for the end of the fiscal. The corporation had planned to submit all treasury bills by March 23 to avoid the last-minute rush. The officials said that there was delay in planning and execution and that’s why the timeline could not be met. Kochi corporation has almost touched 70% in plan expenditure followed by Kozhikode, which has also crossed 60%. The city corporation is still struggling to meet even 60% and this goes against the plans of the newly-constituted council, which was planning big to attain a respectable expenditure percentage this financial year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/corp-faces-challenge-from-contractors/articleshow/81712976.cms||Aswin J Kumar

In fact, they sought more water in view of the city’s increased population. The issue was discussed during the Khadakwasla canal committee meeting chaired by district guardian minister Ajit Pawar on Friday. Irrigation department officials and MLAs from the rural parts too attended. No decision was taken. “We pressed for additional water. The city requires 18.5 TMC of water annually and this demand has been submitted to the state government. Any cut in the existing quota would affect water supply,” Mohol said. Shivajinagar MLA Siddharth Shirole, who was at the meeting, agreed. “Instead of introducing water cuts, the authorities should review the steps being taken to minimize wastage,” he said. At the meeting, PMC made a presentation of the steps being taken to arrest water wastage. “We have initiated steps to reduce water losses in transportation and distribution. The equitable water supply project will also stop wastage,” Anirudh Pavaskar, head of PMC’s water supply department, said. Weekly meetings would be held to review these measures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mayor-mlas-oppose-plan-to-slash-punes-water-quota/articleshow/81713857.cms||---

---||Dehradun||Are Covid-19 norms being enforced properly in schools?||DEHRADUN: With a fresh surge in Covid cases, how are schools in Uttarakhand ensuring that the guidelines for precaution against the infection being followed? The school managements say that the SOPs released by the state government to contain the spread of the pandemic are being followed in letter and spirit. A spot report of few government schools in the city was conducted by a TOI team on Friday to verify these claims. It was found that while most students were wearing a mask, the school officials struggled in maintaining social distancing norms. DS Negi, principal of the Government Model Inter College, Kishanpur, one of the institutions visited by the TOI team, said, “Our student strength is quite strong but our campus is not that spacious. The classrooms also do not have much space. Therefore, we have decided to divide some of the classes into two sections.” He added that “in order to esnure compliance to guidelines, we have asked students of each section to come to school on alternate days.” “Besides, we are running classes in two shifts daily. The second shift ends at 3:30 pm. Also, the time length of each period has been reduced by almost half,” he said. A similar situation was witnessed in government-aided Shahanshahi Sarvhitkari Inter College (SSIC) in Rajpur where social distancing was hardly being maintained. This was especially so during recess when studets could be seen intermingling freely. When queried about the situation and what the government is doing to enforce norms, director of school education (Uttarakhand), RK Kunwar, said, “Though there are some initial jitters, the SOPs are being implemented well largely. We have ensured that amenities required for implementation of the SOPs are available even in schools that are located in remote hilly areas.” In February, the state government had allowed schools to run offline classes for students of Classes VI-IX & XI. As for the students of board classes (X and XII), physical classes had started in November 2020 after a hiatus of more than seven months in the wake of Covid-19 outbreak.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/are-covid-19-norms-being-enforced-properly-in-schools/articleshow/81712959.cms||Mohammad Anab

The family of eight had shared just one room, but Shabana says that was adequate. “At least we could call the room ours,” she said on Friday. She was relieved finally to get the house back after renovation, having lived over a year on rent. Like her, 70 other families that had also lost their homes in the riots have got back fully rebuilt or renovated houses. Maulana Mahmood Madani of Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind (JUH) has handed over the 76 new and restored home to the riot victims, advising the families to strive for moral uprightness and social values and to become better citizens and serve humanity. After their house was set afire, Shabana was so scared that she did not return to the house for two whole months. “Finally, when I did, I was shocked to see the condition of my house. There was not a single thing left,” she recalled. “We had no money and we ran from pillar to post to get funds to restore the house. Help finally came JUH, and just two weeks we were given back the house in which we had lived for 18 years, entirely renovated and liveable.” Reshma, 40, got a fully rebuilt house in Shiv Vihar. Saying she couldn’t be more grateful, she stepped into her house for the first time since seeing it last when it was razed to the ground. “Most houses were first vandalised and then set ablaze,” she said. “In fact, as soon as I stepped out of the house with my newborn baby, I heard one of two gas cylinders in the house explode. The roof also collapsed.” Just as happy and grateful was Bano, whose husband had to undergo surgery after being injured in the communal violence. “I locked myself in the room with my 12-year-old daughter,” remembered Bano. “We heard someone come up the stairs, so we hid under the bed. Someone barged in and vandalised the room but did not discover us. When that person left, we somehow managed to run out from the house which was now on fire. Some policemen on the main road took us to a safe location.” Bano has turned her house into a tuition centre that offers classes to children free of cost. “It's been around two weeks since I started the classes and almost 40 kids have enrolled,” she said. “My house was in a dilapidated condition and since I had exhausted my money, I thought why not change my house into a tuition centre for students of classes XI and above. I turned the ground floor into a tuition centre and live on the first floor.” Afsareen, however, hasn’t been lucky. She lives on rent in a house that was damaged during the riots. “Three of my daughters are dead, while one is bedridden. I have to take care of my daughters’ 13 children,” the beleaguered woman said. “My husband and I are ragpickers and barely make any money to have a decent life. We are paying Rs 2,500 every month as rent, even though the house we live in was considerably damaged in the riots.” Between sobs, she added, “There's nobody who is coming to help us. I don't know what to do.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/re-building-lives-of-riot-victims-brick-by-brick/articleshow/81714768.cms||Pankhuri Yadav

Patients from rural areas having moderate symptoms of Covid-19 can get treatment in their respective talukas instead of traveling to Nashik city. “Over the past three to four weeks there has been a consistent rise in the number of covid patients across the district. On this backdrop, we have reactivated some DCHCs that were closed in January,” said civil surgeon Ratna Raokhande, adding that two more DCHCs are proposed to be activated. The DCHCs at Deolali Camp, Sinnar, Igatpuri,Chandwad, Wani, Nandgaon, Dang Saundane, Pimpalgaon, Abhona, Lasalgaon, Zodaga, Nagarsul, Yeola, Trimbak, Peth have been started. There is a proposal to start the DCHCs at Umrane as well. Senior officials said that patients with moderate and mild symptoms were also rushing to district covid hospital. They should instead opt for treatment at the DCHCs or Covid Care Centres in their respective villages or taluka places.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/15-rural-hosps-in-nashik-to-be-dedicated-to-covid-care/articleshow/81712361.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Noida||Trial begins more than 5 yrs after Akhlaq lynching||Greater Noida: More than five years after a mob attacked and lynched 52-year old Mohammed Akhlaq on suspicion of having beef at his house, trial on the case finally started on March 25. Akhlaq and his son Danish were assaulted by a mob in Bisada village, Dadri, Greater Noida, on the night of September 28, 2015. The incident occurred after an announcement from a local temple asking residents of the village to gather near a transformer in response to rumours of slaughter of cattle. According to police, some members of the mob forcefully entered the two-storey house of Akhlaq, dragged him outside, and beat him to death. His son Danish was injured while trying to save him. While the first chargesheet was filed by UP Police in December 2015, the charges could only be framed in February 25 this year. Akhlaq’s family members who were supposed to depose before the court at the first hearing on March 25 could not do so. The counsel for Mohammed Akhlaq’s family, Yusuf Saifi, said the reason was that the court summons were not sent to them. According to Saifi, though the court had issued summons, UP Police could not ensure that those were delivered to the family on time. “The court has directed that the next hearing would be on April 12 when Shaista, Akhlaq’s daughter, and his wife, Ikraman, would most probably depose,” Saifi said. Akhlaq’s daughter Shaista, his wife Ikraman, son Danish and mother, Asgari, are the key eye-witnesses. Saifi said while the mother-daughter duo are likely to depose on April 12, it will be followed by the deposition of Danish and Akhlaq’s mother Asgari. Other witnesses who are likely to depose include doctors who conducted the post-mortem on Akhlaq and those who treated Danish. Akhlaq’s brother Jaan Mohammed said the witnesses needed police protection for the court visit. “Somehow, it took time in framing charges,” said Mohammed, claiming the accused have been delaying the process by filing different applications. “But we trust the court and hope that truth will prevail,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/trial-begins-more-than-5-yrs-after-akhlaq-lynching/articleshow/81715591.cms||---

In a statement issued, the university said that the 294th meeting of the EC approved the appointment of the new registrar by vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar. “This appointment was in accordance with the Statute 8(2) of JNU,” the university said. “He will be taking care of the office of the registrar until a new registrar is appointed for which an advertisement has already been issued. It is unfortunate that a few faculty members of JNU have tried to manufacture a controversy over an appointment, which is otherwise a routine process,” it added. Jawaharlal Nehru University teachers’ association had earlier questioned the legality of the appointment stating that the registrar’s name can only be approved by the EC. “It was only yesterday evening that the matter of the registrar was brought up as part of the additional agenda. The university must explain their misdeed,” JNUTA secretary Moushumi Basu said. The EC, meanwhile, also decided not to charge hostel fees for the Monsoon Semester, 2020 from students who did not stay in the hostel due to the Covid-19 pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/jnu-clears-the-name-of-new-registrar-amid-fresh-dispute/articleshow/81714753.cms||---
---||Ghaziabad||UP: Surinder Koli gets an acquittal in 13th Nithari case||GHAZIABAD: A special CBI court on Friday acquitted Nithari killings main accused Surinder Koli in the abduction, rape and murder of a 10-year-old girl who had gone missing in April 2006 due to lack of evidence. The prosecution failed to provide any “biological evidence” of the victim in the case. It is the first time Koli has been acquitted in a Nithari case. In all 12 cases the court has ruled on before this, Koli has been awarded capital punishment. While acquitting Koli, Special CBI Judge Amit Veer Singh observed that the court cannot convict a person on the basis of surmises, conjectures and media trials and the prosecution failed to prove the case on “legally admissible evidence”. CBI special public prosecutor JP Sharma said over 250 hearings took place in the case while 33 witnesses were examined. There was no other evidence except for Koli’s confession under CrPC section 164 in front of a metropolitan magistrate in Karkardooma court in Delhi soon after his arrest on December 29, 2006. The case was based on the confession of the accused along with circumstantial evidence. The prosecution, however, was not able to prove the circumstantial evidence on which it relied upon. The difference between this case and other cases was that in all the other cases, biological evidence was found. In those cases, the prosecution relied on the DNA report and skull superimposition test of the biological remains. But in this case, none of the forensic evidence matched with the victim. The prosecution relied upon a piece of cloth that it claimed belonged to the victim, but failed to prove this. So, the chain of circumstantial evidences was not complete. The case pertains to a 10-year-old girl whose mother was a domestic help and father a rickshaw puller. She had gone missing on April 19, 2006. Subsequently, the family had lodged a missing person’s complaint at Sector 20 police station on April 27. After the Nithari Killings came to light, an FIR was registered in this case in December 2006. Even as Koli had confessed to killing the girl in his statement, he retracted it during the trial. The CBI had filed a charge sheet against Koli in the court in connection with the kidnapping, murder, rape of the 10-year-old girl and destroying evidence in the case. A smile appeared on Koli’s face when he heard the verdict. While walking out of court, Koli told media personnel he got justice for the first time. After reaching Dasna jail, he expressed his wish to meet jail superintendent Alok Singh. “He told me about the verdict. His behaviour was normal, even as he was smiling. He added that he has been fighting cases on his own since 2011,” Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/koli-gets-an-acquittal-in-13th-nithari-case/articleshow/81715588.cms||Aditya Dev

---||Pune||Citizens advised patience for jab registration on app||Pune: Citizens have started registering themselves on the Co-WIN app for Covid vaccine under the expanded inoculation programme for all above 45 years, with or without comorbidity, kicking in from April 1. Health officials TOI spoke to, however, advised patience as the process to update the app was yet to be complated.“I had tried to register my name for the shot on the Co-WIN app on Thursday but couldn’t do so. However, I could make it on Friday (March 26). Quite a few of my friends and relatives also registered themselves on Friday for vaccination meant for all above 45 years, irrespective of co-morbidity,” said 46-year-old Karvenagar resident requesting anonymity.State immunisation officer Dileep Patil, however, stressed that people should wait till April 1 as the Co-WIN was slated to undergo some changes. “Till now, we have not received any confirmation from the Union government that the registration has opened up on the Co-WIN app for the expanded vaccination programme covering all the citizens above 45 years of age. It is advisable that people wait for some time for the app to get updated and then opt for registration,” Patil said.Public health expert Sanjay Deshmukh, deputy director of the state health department, Pune region, said, “When an eligible citizen registers on Co-WIN under the expanded vaccination programme, s/he sees the instruction line that the person will have to carry a doctor’s certificate in case of co-morbidity and there is no need to carry the certificate in case there is no pre-existing illness. This line will vanish in the app’s updated version as vaccination would be open to all above 45 years from April 1.” Walk-in or on-the-spot registration followed by vaccination will also be an option for those above 45 years from April 1.“Besides, the eligible people could also be able to get the shot by simply walking into the nearest vaccination centre. They can show up their Aadhaar card/PAN card (proof of age and citizenship), register themselves on the spot on the app and get the shot. Hence online registration is also not going to be a condition to get the shot,” Deshmukh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/citizens-advised-patience-for-jab-registration-on-app/articleshow/81713945.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Due to the absence of the service, patients from the rural areas were not reaching hospitals in time for treatment, she said. Raising the issue in the Parliament, she said that the problem of the dial 108 ambulances was felt in places like Kanashi and Vani in Kalwan taluka, Pimpalgaon Baswant in Niphad taluka, Nanashi in Dindori taluka and in Peth and Satana talukas. When contacted, the authorities running the 108 service said that in some talukas there are issues with the vehicles but all efforts are being made to restart them immediately. Most of the vehicles are developing snags as they have been in service for the past seven to eight years, they said.The ambulances of Nanashi, Wani, Satana and Peth have been taken up for repairs. However, on Sunday, back up ambulances have been deployed in their place. The Pimpalagon Baswant ambulance met with an accident and it would be repaired at the earliest. Further, the ambulance of Kanashi is in service.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/ambulance-missing-in-5-talukas-mp/articleshow/81712380.cms||Santosh Sonawane

---||Pune||Time taken for antibodies’ formation a reason for nCoV in vaccine recipients||Pune: Exposure to high viral load and time taken for the formation of antibodies could be a couple of reasons why some vaccine recipients contracted Covid infection despite receiving the two doses of the vaccine, health experts have said. Healthcare workers have contributed to most cases of infection after the two vaccine doses as they were the first ones to get the two shots. Besides, this is also the group that is directly exposed to high viral load and Covid patients in hospitals, said the experts. Dr Sanjay Lalwani, medical director of Bharati Vidyapeeth Medical Hospital and Research Centre, told TOI, “If somebody gets exposed to the virus, the first line of defense is the antibodies. If the levels of antibodies are lower than required, it is likely that the person will get the infection despite the two doses.”He said the antibodies take some time to form. “If during this interim, first or second dose recipients are exposed to many Covid patients, they could get infected,” Dr Lalwani said.The Bharati Vidyapeeth Medical Hospital and Research Centre also recently undertook contact tracing of those infected with the virus after the two-dose regime. “We found that very few family members of such individuals tested positive for Covid, which means that those infected after two doses still transmit less than those who have not been inoculated,” Dr Lalwani said, adding that more research needed to be done in such cases. Health experts and hospitals treating Covid patients have also said the current surge in cases continues to remain mild. Dr Kapil Zirpe, member of the Pune Covid-19 task force and head of the neurotrauma unit of Ruby Hall Clinic, said, “Covid cases may be surging, but there are less critically ill patients in hospitals. Most are on room air or very less oxygen in comparison to the August end-September Covid peak.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/time-taken-for-antibodies-formation-a-reason-for-ncov-in-vaccine-recipients/articleshow/81713931.cms||Neha Madaan

Hadapsar added around 4,300 cases, while Ahmednagar Road-Vadgaonsheri ward areas recorded over 3,500 cases in the last 15 days — the highest among all the 15 civic ward limits. Somnath Bankar, the head of Hadapsar-Mundhwa ward, said, “We will soon start holding the camps at all the vulnerable spots. Hadapsar has many densely populated pockets, including a huge goathan area. The teams will visit these places and people showing flu-like symptoms will be told to undergo tests. We are appealing to all the residents having symptoms not to visit public places.” Bankar said housing societies could play a crucial role in containing the virus spread. “We want the societies to ensure that their residents wear masks, undergo tests in case of symptoms and follow social distancing norms,” he said. Suhas Jagtap, head of Ahmednagar Road-Vadgaonsheri ward office, said vigil had been stepped up in the residential colonies as well since many cases had been reported from the housing societies. “We are getting positive feedback from many societies, but we still want the residents to be more alert,” Jagtap said. Another official said the administration was planning to hold check-ups at smaller industrial units, workshops located in the city’s fringe areas where people work in groups.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/testing-screening-camps-on-the-cards-in-hadapsar-ahmednagar-road-areas/articleshow/81713901.cms||Sarang Dastane

The daughter of a Biharsharif-based costermonger (seller of fruits and vegetables on handcart), says she wants to become an IAS officer. Talking to the newspaper after the declaration of results on Friday, Sonali believes her achievement would open up new opportunities for her to further excel in academics. “Cracking UPSC Civil Services exam is my dream and I would realize it,” she said. A student of Smt Parmeshwari Devi Girl’s Higher Secondary School at Biharsharif, Sonali scored 471 marks out of 500. She got 98 marks in chemistry, 97 each in physics and mathematics, 93 in Hindi and 87 in English. Sonali, who lives in a rented accommodation in Biharsharif, said she had worked hard for the board examination but had never expected to emerge as a topper. “I studied more than 12 hours per day amid the lockdown. I prepared a lesson plan and rigorously followed it throughout the year. On some days, I woke up till 3am to cover all the topics. Online lectures and textbooks helped me a lot,” she said. Elated by her daughter’s performance, Chunnu Lal said the family suffered a lot during the lockdown but her daughter’s success made it worth that. “I sell fruits on handcart and my wife Savitri Devi prepares channa and sattu to earn a living. We want to give good education to all our three kids, so that they can excel in their fields,” said Lal, whose son appeared in matric exam and elder daughter is pursuing BSc. Born to businessman Sunil Prasad and homemaker Jully Devi, Sugandha Kumari emerged the commerce stream topper by scoring 99 in business studies, 98 in accountancy, 97 in economics, 94 in Hindi and 83 in English. A student of SN Sinha College (Aurangabad), Sugandha wants to become a chartered accountant and she has already started preparation for the exam. Recalling her academic life during the pandemic, the girl said she could not sleep for several nights due to stress. “I was never prepared for that situation -- studies without teachers and school. However, my parents and teachers motivated me and I have reached this milestone because of them,” Sugandha said, adding that she studied more than 14 hours a day and was totally dependent on self-study.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/inter-results-science-topper-wants-to-become-ias-officer/articleshow/81712876.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Hyderabad||ED attaches properties of Hyderabad firm promoters for loan fraud||HYDERABAD: The Enforcement Directorate on Friday provisionally attached 14 immovable properties worth Rs 51 crore belonging to Ishoo Narang, director of Madhapur-based Kyori Oremin Limited and other promoters in a bank fraud case. The immovable properties are located at Vizianagaram, Andhra Pradesh, and Shankarpally, Telangana. ED took up the probe under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act based on FIR registered by CBI, Banking Securities and Fraud Cell, Bengaluru, against KOL. Central Bank of India alleged in the complaint that it was defrauded to the tune of Rs 62.7 crore. Later on, two more FIRs were registered against them by CBI, Hyderabad and Telangana police upon complaints received from Bank of Maharashtra and ICICI Bank respectively for defrauding the banks to the tune of Rs 43 crore and Rs 29.5 crore respectively. The ED alleged, “Money laundering investigation revealed that KOL and its directors defrauded two more banks — Bank of Baroda and State Bank of India. The total amount of loan defrauded in respect of these two banks arrived at Rs 59.3 crore and Rs 41.8 crore. It has been found during investigation that they have defrauded five banks to the tune of Rs 242 crore. KOL subsequently entered into a One Time Settlement with all the five banks and paid a meager final settlement amount of Rs 62 crore against the total NPA of Rs 242 crore. Banks suffered a massive loss of Rs 180 crore.” Telangana HC had earlier dismissed a petition filed by KOL by ruling that criminal investigations are not affected by civil proceedings of debt recovery and OTS. ED investigation traced the diversion of loan amounts by KOL and its directors to the tune of Rs 100 crore. These loans were diverted to fictitious and bogus entities and projected as payments towards business purchases and business expenses. ED stated in a note, “Ishoo Narang was investigated by Income Tax Department also for generation of bogus long term capital gain...”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ed-attaches-properties-of-city-firm-promoters-for-loan-fraud/articleshow/81713922.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

Kabliwala wants free treatment for patients to be continued at the designated private hospitals. In his PIL filed on Thursday, Kabliwala urged the court to direct authorities to act in public interest according to their policy adopted on April 16, 2020. Under the policy, the civic body is to bear the cost of Covid treatment. The AMC had designated some private hospitals as Covid facilities and had reserved beds in them for free treatment in the AMC quota. Later, as Covid cases reduced, the authorities denotified these hospitals. Kabliwala is against the denotification and restricting free Covid treatment to only Civil Hospital, Sola Civil Hospital, and SVP Hospital. The PIL is likely to come up for hearing next week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/pil-seeks-free-covid-treatment-at-pvt-hospitals/articleshow/81713947.cms||---
---||Navi-mumbai||Covid cases at new peaks in Maharashtra & Mumabi, vax nos also rise||MUMBAI: For the third straight day, the state (36,902) and the city (5,515) recorded new peaks of daily Covid-19 cases on Friday. Active cases in the state have shot up to 2,82,451 — closer to the state government’s projection of over 3 lakh in the first week of April. The state on Friday reported 111 deaths, including 13 in Mumbai. The daily caseload in the Greater Mumbai Region stood at 10,062 with 25 deaths, even as Nashik district raced ahead of Nagpur (4,556) with 6,493 detections on Friday. The bright spot was the high vaccination numbers. After three days of below-40,000 turnout, it jumped to 40,360 on Friday. The state on Thursday vaccinated 2,14,123, pushing the overall coverage to 52.65 lakh. Mumbai has immunised 10.48 lakh overall. Interestingly, several 45-plus citizens without co-morbidities, who can take the shots from April 1, could manage to register on Co-WIN, the BMC has learnt. Civic officials said they haven’t received any official communication from the Centre stating that the new group could register. Dr Sheela Jagtap, immunisation in-charge, said people are able to register online but at the time of verification, the portal is still asking for a comorbidity certificate. There could a software upgrade to allow the change, said the civic official. In the meantime, the high second wave has triggered a rush for hospital beds in the city. Only 24% of the 3,111 beds in the private sector are vacant as against 40% two days ago. While 67% ICU beds in the public sector are vacant, only 31% of the private ICU beds are available. “As most patients are from well-off families, they want private beds,” said a senior BMC official. The BMC has asked private hospitals to increase the number of Covid beds to 5,000 from the present 3,111. The city has almost 13,000 beds, with plans to increase it to 21,000 in the coming weeks. Dr Gautam Bhanshali from Bombay Hospital, who is a state task force member, said: “We have started getting calls from people who say they are making enquiries for relatives just in case there is a need.” He said Bombay Hospital had reduced its Covid beds to 32 at the start of the February but has increased it to 78. Dr Rahul Pandit, head of intensive care in Fortis Hospital and also a member of the task force, said the state looked to be in a “bad shape”, but “with rising testing, more cases are bound to be detected”. He added that the second wave is nowhere near its peak. “The peak could arrive sometime in mid-April and cases will start declining thereafter till the next.” Thane recorded its highest tally of 990 fresh cases and two deaths on Friday. The toll here has climbed to 1,376. In Navi Mumbai, 610 cases were detected, taking the total to 62,286. Two deaths were reported, taking the toll to 1,160.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/maharashtra-covid-cases-at-new-peaks-in-state-city-vax-nos-also-rise/articleshow/81720759.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||Mumbai||‘Poor coordination between disaster response agencies’in Mumbai||Mumbai: As the fire raging ins-ide Dreams Mall in Bhandup worsened in the wee hours of Friday, it was disappointing to realise the poor coordination betw-een disaster response agencies.  I reached the spot less than an hour after the fire brigade was called at 11.59pm. I saw that the fire brigade was having difficulty getting its huge tankers close enough to the inferno because of the Wadala-Thane Metro work. There were no traffic police to create corridors to help them. Only a divisional fire official, a junior civic engineer and some policemen were there. A small turntable ladder (Magirus) with a small cage to bring people down was operational. Some of the firemen who entered the mall confessed their fear: They had to rescue Covid patients, but didn’t have proper gear to protect themselves. I called additional commissioner Suresh Kakani, who handles health and the fire brigade, and BMC disaster management chief Mahesh Narvekar to convey that this was no minor fire. The BMC control room told me chief fire officer K V Hivrale was not taking calls for the last one and half hours. Finally, one aerial ladder platform arrived. It was 1.30am by the time the disaster management cell informed assistant commissioner of S ward Acharekar. Around 1.45 pm, the local MSEDCL office cut off power supply to the mall, making things more difficult. Worse, the fire brigade didn’t have an auxiliary power unit truck. Dr Nafees of Sunrise Hospital and his colleagues told the officers that most patients were in the refuge area. P Pandya, who was outside the mall, said: “My mother-in-law, who is 85 years old and a diabetic, is admitted here due to Covid. We don’t know how she is.” Hivrale finally came at 2.17am. In the meantime, as he had not responded to calls, Narvekar had requested deputy commissioner (disaster management) Prabhat Rahangdale, who was former chief fire officer, to reach the spot. By then Kakani too arrived. Finally, Rahangdale decided to take charge. He asked Choudhari to send 20 men with breathing apparatus sets from the rear side to control fire. He also ordered some personnel with PPE kits to rescue those trapped. While some of Hivrale’s close aides were heard telling others not to follow Rahangdale’s orders, he soon prevailed. Kakani entered the mall twice to check the fire raging on the first and second floors. The billowing smoke, along with the fact that most of us had dual masks, made breathing difficult. Kakani then sat in the control post van to draw up a plan to shift patients to various hospitals. More police force arrived and, around 3.30am, they hauled up a group of locals helping the firemen for crowding the spot. As I was left the site by 4.30 am, I could see help coming in.

Justice Devan Ramachandran criticized the corporation and the Operation Breakthrough team after the court was informed that the preparatory works for restoring Mullassery Canal, the 12 link canals between Vaduthala and Atlantis Junction, and improvement of ‘Puchathodu’ and ‘Karithodu’ lakes may be delayed. Tender process for the various components of the works has not yet been initiated on account of the model code of conduct, the court was informed. In an interim order, the court said, “I am rather disturbed by the afore stand because the works in question have to be completed in any case before mid-May, 2021, since we are expecting the monsoon to reach the shores of Kerala by then, or a few days later. Hence, any further delay can cause cataclysmic consequences to the city.” The court said the model code of conduct does not interdict works being carried out under orders of the high court and said it cannot be cited as an excuse by any official. Advocate commissioner Sunil Jacob Jose submitted that pre-monsoon works have to commence immediately as any further delay would cause inundation as experienced in the last two years. As Kochi Corporation’s counsel submitted works will be carried out without considering the model code of conduct in view of the court’s clarification, the court directed the advocate commissioner to monitor the work and file report to the court if necessary. The court also ordered Kochi Corporation to file bi-weekly reports on works being done.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-pulls-up-kochi-corp-for-flood-prevention-work-delay/articleshow/81712995.cms||---

After a short breather, the Covid-19 threat is looming large over the state with 211 cases recorded on Friday. Patna reported a maximum of 66 cases. Officially two deaths were reported, and the toll has now reached 1,569. The health department has appealed to people to avoid public gathering during Holi and follow all social-distancing and safety norms. To tackle the situation, the department has targeted to test 70% of samples through RT-PCR and TrueNat method, which means nearly 44,400 samples will be tested from Saturday onwards, unlike the 36,000 samples, which were being tested so far using the two methods. "The next couple of days are crucial, keeping in mind Holi and the arrival of people from states with high infection rates," health department principal secretary Pratyaya Amrit said. Sharing the break-up of data for Thursday, when 258 people had tested positive, Pratyaya said out of these, 23 have come from other states and another 41 are their close contacts. A further break-up for Thursday shows that eight positive people came from Gujarat, Maharashtra (4), Uttar Pradesh (3), Delhi (3), Haryana (3) and Rajasthan (1). Another 41 positive cases on Thursday were detected from micro containment zones. A total of 241 micro containment zones were created in the state till Friday morning, of which 15 are in the Patna district. As of Friday, a maximum of 418 active cases was in Patna followed by Bhagalpur ( 67), Araria (63), Begusarai (41) and Rohtas (39). The increase in the number of cases has also led to an increase in the number of patients being admitted to the hospital. At AIIMS-Patna, five Covid-19 positive people were admitted, and on Friday there were 41 patients in the hospital.  Meanwhile, the state health department is gearing up for a vaccination drive from April 1 when everyone above 45 years will be given the vaccine. The department’s principal secretary Pratyaya Amrit said they were in the process of increasing the number of session sites and take it down to the grass-root level. Currently, there are nearly 1,700 session sites, however, Pratyaya said the additional number of sites will be decided in a day. He further said they have now targeted to vaccinate over 71 lakh pension holders and over 1.5 crore people would be vaccinated across the state. Meanwhile, over one lakh beneficiaries were given the vaccine on Friday and it included both the first and second dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-rings-alarm-bells-ahead-of-holi-as-covid-cases-spike/articleshow/81712839.cms||Sheezan Nezami

But thanks to a friend who was aware of a dashboard showing vacant beds, the family got a bed in the Khodiyarnagar area on New VIP Road.The dashboard that came in handy was started by the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. The civic body had realised then that while there were vacant beds available in the city, panic triggers were pressed when the person did not get a bed in the hospitals of his preference or in nearby areas.Said Mehul Patel, who had identified the bed for the elderly man on Thursday night, “The hospital that we contacted was helpless as it did not have a single vacant bed. When the hospital was told that the patient’s condition as serious and his oxygen saturation level was 70, it advised that we should identify a bed anywhere and get the patient admitted. We were also told that the patient may need a ventilator,” said Patel. Patel identified the nearest hospitals with vacant ICU beds from the dashboard on VMC’s website www.vmc.gov.in. The numbers were shared with a relative of the patient, who got a bed in the first hospital he called. The dashboard has details of number of ICU, oxygen and mild symptom beds along with contact number of hospital’s nodal officer.Officer on special duty for Covid-19 and education secretary Vinod Rao said that the dashboard was started around June last year when the number of Covid-19 hospitals in the city increased as private hospitals were empanelled. “We started relative data entry and also linked the 108 emergency services with the system. In case the service is called to take a Covid-19 patient, the crew of the ambulance will first check if the hospital where the patient wants to go has a bed available. If not, it will inform about the hospitals with available beds,” said Rao.He said that the bed capacity of hospitals was checked by medical officers. Also, officials called up hospitals at regular interval in a day to ensure that vacant beds reflect in the system are actually available.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/vmcs-live-hospital-dashboard-helps-patients-find-beds-in-emergency/articleshow/81714296.cms||---

Hence, we have been warning people. If the situation goes out of the hands, we will be forced to announce ‘lockdown’ after April 2,” said Bhujbal. Bhujbal, who also toured some parts of Nashik city today before conducting the review and requested them to wear the masks. He also warned the people – especially the shopkeepers for violating norms. “I had been in the market and have seen how careless a large section of people is with respect to the preventive measures. No wonder the number of active cases across the district rose from 2,469 on February 25 to 19,000 on March 25,” Bhujbal said. The minister added that Nashik city is the most affected as it has more than 80% of the total cases. In a new initiative, Bhujbal called upon the neighbours, the members of the management committees of the housing societies and others to keep an eye on Covid-19 patients in home isolation. “The citizens should call up the police or the local NMC officials to inform if there are any violations. The teams will visit and if found to be true, appropriate action will be initiated against them,” Bhujbal said. The guardian minister also asked the NMC and the police teams to visit the homes of the patients randomly and check for violations. According to Bhujbal, one of the main reasons for the rise in the number of patients in Nashik district is that a section of the asymptomatic patients in home isolation is violating the norms and moving around in the public. Bhujbal also warned the private medical practitioners about informing the NMC about the Covid-19 patients under their care.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/decision-on-lockdown-in-nashik-on-april-2-bhujbal/articleshow/81712390.cms||Abhilash Botekar

The decision has been taken in view of increasing Covid-19 cases in its limit. As of now, there are 205 positive cases in the cantonment limits.Dr VD Gaikwad, resident medical officer of PCB, said, “We are currently treating Covid-19 patients at the hospital, so it will not be appropriate to treat other patients at the hospital. We will only run a special OPD for the general public to prevent any inconvenience.”PCB had taken a similar decision last year and had reopened the general OPD when Covid-19 cases reduced.Amit Kumar, PCB chief executive officer, said, “We are reporting Covid cases from across the cantonment limit at present. So, our endeavour is to make adequate healthcare infrastructure available at the hospital to treat the patients as well as general public.”PCB has decided to restart two dispensaries in Pune camp area and one at Ghorpadi. One dispensary will only attend to senior citizens, said Gaikwad. The cantonment plans to provide 200 oxygen-supported beds for Covid-19 patients in two phases and has sought Rs 90 lakh from the district administration.DCB marks sealed spots The Dehu Road Cantonment Board (DCB) has marked the market and adjacent areas as micro-containment zones in view of the increasing Covid-19 cases. “Only essential service shops can remain open.

---||Kolkata||West Bengal assembly elections 2021: Tollywood stars’ friendship faces political trial||KOLKATA: Friendship in Tollywood seems to have become the biggest casualty during this election. Decades-old friends, director-turned-Trinamool candidate Raj Chakrabarty and actor-turned-BJP candidate Rudranil Ghosh, said they had no problem working professionally with political opponents. But after-parties in Tollywood over good food and music, where actor-director Parambrata Chatterjee was often seen singing and sharing a joke with Rudranil, might suffer a blow. Last year, Rudranil directed a commercial with Kanchan Mullick in the lead that gained huge popularity. But after the 2021 elections, in which the two will contest from two rival political parties, will Rudranil be able to work with Kanchan? “I have no problem. Political views have no clash with professional work,” said Rudranil. Raj was the first one to congratulate Rudranil when his name was announced as a poll contestant. “On the micro-blogging site, I also wished Srabanti and Tanushree, when their names were announced. They are my industry colleagues. Why wouldn’t I wish them?” Raj said. “There will be fights on the political platform. On the professional field, I will cast actors, based on their merit, not their belief.” If Trinamool candidate Koushani Mukherjee is to be believed, her partner, Bonny Sengupta, joining BJP will not impact their relationship. “My mother and Koushani are in the Trinamool, while I am with BJP. As her boyfriend, I want her to win. But if my party wants, I will campaign in her constituency,” Bonny said. Koushani Mukherjee and Bonny SenguptaBut for some, the camaraderie might take a hit. Actor Anirban Bhattacharya understands the challenges. “Polarisation has happened. We have to continue negotiating with the turmoil,” he said. After the video of ‘Nijeder Mote Nijeder Gaan’ went viral, can he be friends with Rudranil? “There is no bar on adda. But it is a critical scene. Rudra-da and others are now in the forefront of partisan politics. There is a difference between supporting an ideology and becoming a party worker, which comes with a lot of compulsions. Our behavior will be restricted,” he said, admitting it was “slightly problematic” to expect one to leave aside one’s political beliefs and still be friends. Anirban BhattacharyaSinger-songwriter Anupam Roy and his wife, social worker Piya Chakraborty, would attend parties with celebrities who have joined BJP in attendance. “A difference of opinion, debate and pluralism are welcome. But in the current scene, personal interactions in private space will be difficult with people who follow that ideology,” Anupam said. Piya added in the atmosphere of growing fascism, it would be difficult to have in their private space people who they think were advocates of that ideology. “We would prefer not to have them in our intimate gatherings. But in public events or professional meetings, things will be courteous,” she said. Rwitobroto MukherjeeRwitobroto Mukherjee, too, is clear that friendship with people pulled by parties against which he had been vocal was out question. “I will have to work with them. But personally, I am hurt. I don’t want to be friends with them.” Referring to theatre personality Koushik Kar, who recently joined BJP, he said, “I have worked with him in his first film, ‘Pornomochi’. He was a brother to me. But I can no longer behave with him like I used to.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tolly-stars-friendship-faces-political-trial/articleshow/81713964.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

The police said that Rahul Siraswal and Mahesh Dev were taken into custody in Indore, and later they were brought to Hyderabad and arrested. Police said they received a complaint on March 1 from a woman, who claimed that she was duped by unknown online fraudsters of Rs 1.2 crore. The victim claimed that on Facebook, she got a notification from an unknown woman, who claimed to be a consultant in share trading. The woman lured her into opening a demat account, and promised to help her get high profits. The accused shared various bank accounts, into which she asked the victim to transfer money. The victim initially transferred Rs 5 lakh. The accused informed the victim she had earned Rs 88 lakh on the sum she invested. The accused told the victim that to claim the money, she will have to pay fees. “Believing the woman, the complainant transferred some more money. After losing a total of Rs 1.2 crore, the victim realized that she was cheated and approached the police,’’ JCP (CCS) Avinash Mohanty said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/two-cheat-woman-of-rs-1-2cr-nabbed/articleshow/81713959.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Covid cases at new peaks in Maharashtra & Mumabi, vax nos also rise||MUMBAI: For the third straight day, the state (36,902) and the city (5,515) recorded new peaks of daily Covid-19 cases on Friday. Active cases in the state have shot up to 2,82,451 — closer to the state government’s projection of over 3 lakh in the first week of April. The state on Friday reported 111 deaths, including 13 in Mumbai. The daily caseload in the Greater Mumbai Region stood at 10,062 with 25 deaths, even as Nashik district raced ahead of Nagpur (4,556) with 6,493 detections on Friday. The bright spot was the high vaccination numbers. After three days of below-40,000 turnout, it jumped to 40,360 on Friday. The state on Thursday vaccinated 2,14,123, pushing the overall coverage to 52.65 lakh. Mumbai has immunised 10.48 lakh overall. Interestingly, several 45-plus citizens without co-morbidities, who can take the shots from April 1, could manage to register on Co-WIN, the BMC has learnt. Civic officials said they haven’t received any official communication from the Centre stating that the new group could register. Dr Sheela Jagtap, immunisation in-charge, said people are able to register online but at the time of verification, the portal is still asking for a comorbidity certificate. There could a software upgrade to allow the change, said the civic official. In the meantime, the high second wave has triggered a rush for hospital beds in the city. Only 24% of the 3,111 beds in the private sector are vacant as against 40% two days ago. While 67% ICU beds in the public sector are vacant, only 31% of the private ICU beds are available. “As most patients are from well-off families, they want private beds,” said a senior BMC official. The BMC has asked private hospitals to increase the number of Covid beds to 5,000 from the present 3,111. The city has almost 13,000 beds, with plans to increase it to 21,000 in the coming weeks. Dr Gautam Bhanshali from Bombay Hospital, who is a state task force member, said: “We have started getting calls from people who say they are making enquiries for relatives just in case there is a need.” He said Bombay Hospital had reduced its Covid beds to 32 at the start of the February but has increased it to 78. Dr Rahul Pandit, head of intensive care in Fortis Hospital and also a member of the task force, said the state looked to be in a “bad shape”, but “with rising testing, more cases are bound to be detected”. He added that the second wave is nowhere near its peak. “The peak could arrive sometime in mid-April and cases will start declining thereafter till the next.” Thane recorded its highest tally of 990 fresh cases and two deaths on Friday. The toll here has climbed to 1,376. In Navi Mumbai, 610 cases were detected, taking the total to 62,286. Two deaths were reported, taking the toll to 1,160.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-covid-cases-at-new-peaks-in-state-city-vax-nos-also-rise/articleshow/81714861.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: App cab firm refunds money after complaint||KOLKATA: An app cab company has refunded the excess amount, which a passenger was charged after the fare was revised during the ride, when he lodged an online complaint with the national consumer helpline. Partha Pratim Saha, a senior official with South Eastern Railway, had booked an app cab from Kudghat to Howrah Station around 3.50pm on March 11. During the ride, the driver refused to switch on the air-conditioner, citing high fuel prices and the loss being incurred by cabs. After the ride Saha received an inflated bill with the fare one and a half times the amount that had originally been indicated at the time of booking. Though Saha paid Rs 455through his e-wallet, he was irked at having been charged Rs 198more than what had been shown at the time of booking. He was not even intimidated about the revision of the fare. “Had the higher fare been indicated earlier, I could have tried out another cab service provider or opted for a metered cab. But there was no alert till the final bill was generated at the end of the ride. This was unfair,” said Saha. Several other app cab riders have in recent times experienced what Saha did. He, however, was incensed enough to write to the Uber help desk. But when he did not receive a feedback in the next 10 days, he lodged an online complaint with the national consumer helpline (www.consumerhelpline.gov.in), an integrated grievance redress mechanism of the government of India, on March 21 after he returned from the trip to Satna, Madhya Pradesh. Within five days of this complaint, Uber sent a message to Saha, admitting their fault, and refunded Rs 305 to his payment wallet. The Rs 150 fare charged for the 13.4km ride was actually lower than the original estimate. Uber as well as Ola, when contacted, said the fare hike during the ride could be due to a technological glitch.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/app-cab-firm-refunds-money-after-plaint/articleshow/81713949.cms||---

It comes two days after clerics in Shamli district refused to solemnize a ‘nikaah’ after seeing the groom dancing “violently” on the roof of a car to DJ music. It left the groom and bride sides in a lurch in Shamli’s Kairana area. “Ulemas (clerics) everywhere are being told not to conduct ‘nikaah’ in such marriages. We are also against dowry and the clerics will not solemnize weddings where it has been given,” said Qari Ishaq Gora, a prominent cleric in Deoband. The decision to boycott such weddings was taken at a meeting of clerics in Muzaffarnagar before the Friday prayers. During the post prayer sermon, the clerics also asked the people to avoid use of loud music and firecrackers. Maulana Mufti Asrarul Haq, who had called the meeting, said, “Every cleric has welcomed the decision.

The draft of the proposed regulations published on February 27, 2009, deals with the right to life of people under Article 21 of the Constitution. The rules were to be applicable to buildings vulnerable to manmade disasters like fire and terrorist attacks, including the assembly, institutional and educational structures, malls and hotels. Singh said under Section 46 of the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, any notice of draft notification needs outright implementation. By keeping the rules pending for over 12 years, the state has violated Section 10 of the Maharashtra Government Servants Regulation of Transfer and Prevention of Delay in Discharge of Official Duties Act, which mandates that any decision on a matter should be taken within 90 days, she added. —Swati Deshpande||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-enforce-2009-draft-rules-for-high-risk-bldgs-says-petitioner/articleshow/81715708.cms||---

Three doctors and two nurses of NMCH had recently tested positive for Covid-19. All of them, except a nurse, had taken first and second doses of the vaccine. In fact, two doctors had taken their second dose more than a month back and the third one on March 15. Health department principal secretary Pratyaya Amrit said though some such cases were of late being reported, there was no need to doubt the efficacy of Covid vaccines. Asked about the condition of doctors who have tested positive after getting vaccine shots, NMCH superintendent Dr Binod Kumar Singh said, “They have very mild symptoms like body ache and slight cold and are under home isolation.” At AIIMS-Patna, five medicos and two administrative staff have tested positive for Covid-19. They had taken only the first dose of vaccine. Nodal incharge for Covid-19 Dr Sanjeev Kumar said taking the vaccine does not mean that one will not contract the virus. “The virus does not affect body parts of those vaccinated. The vaccine reduces severity of illness, but does not prevent transmission of the virus,” he added. Meanwhile, one Satyendra Prasad Verma, whose wife Vindavasani Devi (45), an anganwadi worker, had died after testing positive for the virus at AIIMS-Patna on March 19 despite taking two doses of vaccine, on Friday alleged that the latter was forced to take the second dose of the vaccine even though she had fallen sick after taking the first dose. “My wife was given the first dose of vaccine on February 5. She, however, fell sick on February 10 and started vomiting. We had even taken her to a gastroenterologist in Gaya. However, she was given the second dose despite experiencing side effects after taking the first shot,” Verma told TOI. Nodal incharge for Covid-19 at AIIMS-P Dr Sanjeev Kumar said the woman was admitted to the hospital on March 11 and put on ventilator on March 19 after her condition deteriorated. “The woman’s oxygen level had dropped and she was suffering from viral pneumonitis,” Dr Kumar added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/vaccines-prevent-severe-illness-death-health-experts/articleshow/81712852.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Kochi||Kerala to vaccinate all above 45 years before school reopening||KOCHI: The state health department has made extensive arrangements to vaccinate all people above 45 years from April 1. The aim is to cover all people in this age group before the schools reopen. Vaccination facilities will be available at central and state government hospitals, government designated private hospitals and public buildings. “In view of the increasing incidence of Covid cases in other states, the state medical board assessed that it is essential that everyone in this category receive the Covid vaccine to intensify Covid immunization activities,” said a government press note. According to the sero-surveillance study published on March 23, almost 89% of people in the state have not yet got Covid-19, making this population at increased risk of contracting the disease. With new variants of the virus emerging, the health department said that if the low infection rate is to be maintained in the state, then those who need to be vaccinated on a priority basis should be vaccinated before opening of the educational institutions. Covid-19 vaccines help protect a person against the infection because it builds immunity against the virus. Also, it reduces the risk of infection and transmission to others. A total of 29,33,594 doses of vaccine have been administered in the state so far. As many as 4,70,643 health workers were given the first dose and 3,11,594 received the second dose.

There were 140 guests staying at the luxury hotel. An Art of Living ashram in Rishikesh also reported three Covid-19 cases in a day. “The Taj Rishikesh Resort and Spa in Rishikesh’s Byasi area will remain closed for sanitisation for the next 48 hours,” sub divisional magistrate of Narendra Nagar, Yukta Mishra, told TOI. “The order was issued by the district magistrate after too many staffers got Covid-19,” added a health official who visited the resort on Friday to take stock of the safety preparations. A source said the resort started testing its staff after a senior administrator tested positive. Over 100 staffers have been tested so far, of which 31 were found infected. “Reports of over 80 samples collected from the resort are still pending,” additional chief medical officer of Tehri, Dr Jagdish Joshi said. However, no decision has been taken about testing the 140 guests there or moving them elsewhere. “The resort administration may keep the resort shut for longer to protect guests and staffers,” the visiting health official said. As of now, the resort has been asked to ensure no staffer is back on the job until full recovery and that no new guest is admitted without following Covid-19 safety protocols. “Most staffers are asymptomatic, but we have kept them in isolation. They are being administered proper treatment. We will send sanitisation teams to the resort on Saturday and Sunday again, and collect more samples for contact tracing,” Joshi said. The health department of Tehri could also close an ashram in the area for sanitisation after new cases emerged. “We are seeking permission to shut Sri Sri Ravi Shankar’s Art of Living ashram here after three residents tested positive for Covid-19 in 24 hours,” Joshi said on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/5-star-resort-near-rishikesh-turns-covid-hotspot-over-30-staffers-test-ve/articleshow/81713010.cms||Ishita Mishra

Two other persons also died in separate accidents in the city. The constable, Mamata Basak (29), who was riding the two-wheeler, and the pillion rider, Santa Orao (28), were on the way to the police station when the accident took place around 1.40pm. The duo fell on the road after the two-wheeler skidded and Basak was hit by a mini-truck coming from behind. They were rushed to RG Kar Hospital where Basak was declared dead. Orao was later shifted to Apollo Hospital. Both of them were residents of Shantipur in Nadia and lived at Nowdapara PHE. “It is not clear how the two fell on the road from the two-wheeler. We are yet to get any clear CCTV footage. The truck was coming behind them and Basak came under its wheels before the driver could react,” said a police officer. The two-wheeler will be sent for mechanical test. In another accident, a pedestrian, Jagitan singh (56) of Kankurgachi, died after being hit by a bike on Maniktala Main Road around 2.30pm on Friday.

In the past 24 hours, five more – including four students and a family member of a staff member – tested positive, said sources at the premier B-school. In association with Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation, the institute has launched a vaccination drive for faculty and staff members. Over 50 people got vaccinated on the first day, said sources. “Keeping in mind the surge in cases, students have been barred from playing outdoor games, eating in canteens (they can take their meal to their respective rooms) and form any kind of gathering on the campus,” said an official. The students and faculty members, however, have shown their displeasure at how the pandemic is being managed. “The administration is currently engaged in fire-fighting. However, even today, construction work at both old and new campuses is going on and isolation rules are not being followed stringently,” said a member, on condition of anonymity. According to the IIM-A Covid-19 dashboard, the B-school had reported 10 positive cases on March 25, 6 on March 24 and 11 on March 23 – totalling 27 in three days. Given the population on the campus, the positivity rate is much higher than the general population, pointed out experts. Ironically, it was an IIM-A faculty paper in 2020 that had argued that opening the residential campuses is not advisable due to possibility of high spread, they added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/covid-19-cases-cross-40-at-iim-a/articleshow/81713970.cms||---

Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) had given a nation-wide ‘Bharat Bandh’ call which evoked good response in Punjab and Haryana, and a mixed one in UP and Uttarakhand. In Muzaffarnagar -- the headquarters of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) -- farmers blocked several roads, including the one connecting Delhi to Dehradun, for over two hours before dispersing. Even as they blocked the highways, the protesters allowed vehicles carrying essential items to pass. Meerut and Baghpat also saw protests at various crossings. Traffic was disrupted on Delhi-Yamunotri Highway in Baghpat when farmers placed tractor trolleys in the middle of the road. The blockade was cleared by 3pm. In Bijnor, farmers blocked entry points to the city at Ganga barrage and at a few more places in the district. Talking to TOI over phone from Ghazipur border, spokesperson of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha, Jagtar Singh Bajwa, said that the movement will go on. “On March 28, we will burn the copies of farm laws all across the country on occasion of Holi.” State general secretary of BKU, Thakur Ram Avtar Singh, said in Bijnor, “We are sitting here against the three agriculture laws and non-consideration of our demand on formation of a law on minimum support price (MSP). We also demand immediate withdrawal of cases filed against the farmers.” BKU president Naresh Tikait had announced just a three-hour road blockade in the region to ensure that people don’t face inconvenience. While in Punjab and Haryana, the blockade was for the entire day. “It causes a lot of problems to travellers and we did not want that. The main aim was to make our voices heard, and that is being done. A three-hour ‘bandh’ is enough for that," Tikait has said. The protesters also tried to block the Yamuna Expressway in Mathura. They were stopped by police at Raya crossing, Mathura. Later, the farmers staged a protest on Raya-Hathras road underpass of the e-way and blocked the traffic. Heavy police force was deployed along the expressway to prevent farmers from blocking it. BKU’s state vice president, Buddha Singh, who led the protest in Mathura, said, “We allowed passage to all emergency vehicles while staging the protest. We understand the problems of people, but this government is not ready to listen to us.” In Aligarh, farmers blocked Aligarh-Palwal road. While in Pilibhit, protesters blocked the Pilibhit-Basti national highway for two hours. In Uttarakhand’s Terai region, the ‘bandh’ call evoked a mixed response. In the towns of Udham Singh Nagar district, markets were shut till 1pm. Markets in Bazpur, Kashipur, Nanakmatta, Gadarpur and Sitarganj towns were shut till afternoon and protests were held. The grain markets, however, remained closed throughout the day. The farmers also took out a protest march. President of Terai Kisan Mahasabha, Tejender Singh Virk, said, “People from all walks of life have supported the call. They have extended unconditional support to the ongoing farmers’ movement at various Delhi borders.” (With inputs from Sandeep Rai, Anuja Jaiswal, Keshav Agrawal & Aakash Ahuja)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/bharat-bandh-all-western-up-cities-witness-protests-highways-blocked-briefly/articleshow/81712997.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Fire victims’ kin scour hosps, even mortuaries for update in Mumbai||Mumbai: The ordeal for families of patients affected in the Sunrise Hospital fire didn’t end for hours after the flames were doused. Most searched multiple hospitals and even mortuaries for their loved ones while others pleaded in vain with police and fire personnel to fetch the medical files as doctors were grappling in the dark about their health conditions. Cramped in an ambulance with three Covid-19 patients, Sanjeev Nair recalled the panic early on Friday morning as he shifted his mother-in-law Radha Kaladharan from Sunrise to Mulund jumbo hospital. He was counting every second in that 20-minute commute as Kaladharan, who was on oxygen support at Sunrise, was shifted without one. “After she was rescued from the terrace through a ladder, I thought we shouldn’t waste any time and rushed her to Mulund. Her medical files, cellphone, everything was gone, but we luckily found a bed and medical support in Mulund,” he said, as he waited outside the gate of the jumbo hospital on Friday afternoon for an update on her health and finding a way to deliver a cellphone to her. Her condition was stable, said dean Dr Pradeep Angre. Muskan Khanna and her husband wore a worried look outside Mulund jumbo hospital where her brother Paritosh Rajput (39) and father Jagdish (65) were shifted after the fire. Both were on oxygen support at the hospital. Muskan said her mother, too, was positive and under home isolation. The family had come positive on Saturday evening, following which the father and son got admitted to Mulund jumbo. They didn’t like the hygiene condition there and moved to Sunrise. “We hoped for better care but Sunrise doctors gave us little update on their health,” said Muskan. The fire has shaken her brother, who has already been grappling with Covid. “He is barely able to talk about it while my father has fallen unconscious multiple times,” she said. On Friday, the family was back to calling hospitals looking for beds. At Sunrise, staffers said they also managed to rescue over 63 patients, with some even refusing to be saved. “There was a patient who is also battling cancer. He just didn’t want to move out of his room. In another case, we literally lifted a man weighing 150kg and put him on a wheelchair. He had come out of the ventilator just a day before. He was refusing to come out of his room even as the smoke spread,” a staffer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/fire-victims-kin-scour-hosps-even-mortuaries-for-update-in-mumbai/articleshow/81713977.cms||Sumitra Debroy

---||Delhi||Centre, Delhi differ over ‘unfit’ rations; Union Ministry Seeks Action Taken Report||New Delhi: The Union ministry of consumer affairs, food and public distribution has once again asked Delhi’s food department to submit an action taken report on discrepancies found during an inspection of public distribution system (PDS) shops in August-September 2020. The reminder letter was sent last week. Currently, the Centre and Delhi government are in a confrontation over doorstep delivery of ration. The Aam Aadmi Party government’s plans to roll out the scheme from March 25 got stalled due to objections by the Union ministry of consumer affairs. The inspection was carried out at 71 fair price shops by five teams from the Centre’s department of food and public distribution. The 138 samples (70 of wheat and 68 of rice) collected were then analysed in the Central Grain Analysis Laboratory. While 90 samples were found beyond the rejection limit according to the uniform specifications of foodgrains, 42 samples (18 of wheat and 24 of rice) were found beyond the PFA/FSSAl standards and deemed unfit for human consumption. The results of the analysis were communicated to Delhi’s food commissioner in October 2020. “In view of the seriousness of the matter, it was requested to submit an action taken report to the ministry, but so far no communication has been received. Therefore, you are once again requested to submit the report at the earliest,” the letter dated March 18 stated. In October last year, the Union ministry had also written to the Delhi chief secretary informing him about the results of the inspection and tests of samples. “Various shortcomings have been observed, which points towards serious negligence of duties/responsibilities on the part of fair price shop owners and officers/authorities involved in the whole process of distribution,” stated the letter, underlining that proper functioning of fair price shops was necessary for robust implementation of the public distribution system since it formed a direct point of contact with beneficiaries. Delhi food minister Imran Hussain said, “During the lockdown, we had complained to the Centre about the rotten rations we had received from them and demanding immediate action. We had also returned such foodgrains. Since the start, Delhi government has been serious about the quality of cereals and pulses distributed under the PDS scheme. We won’t tolerate any irresponsibility or laxity regarding the quality of rations coming from the Centre’s godowns.” “As far as the use of the e-pass machines in PDS shops is concerned, the ‘one country one ration card’ scheme and doorstep facility will be ensured in Delhi. The Centre has been informed about this decision of the Delhi cabinet,” added the minister. There are over 2,000 fair price shops in Delhi that provide monthly rations to 17 lakh card holders linked to around 72 lakh people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/centre-delhi-differ-over-unfit-rations-union-ministry-seeks-action-taken-report/articleshow/81714813.cms||AlokKNMishra

Despite previous infection, one dose of vaccine and good antibodies, the patient developed a moderately Covid pneumonia requiring oxygen. Suspecting it to be a case of mutated Covid-19 or new strain of Covid-19, the hospital sent the samples of the patient to National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune and also to Sawai Man Singh Medical College. A 28-year-old dental doctor was admitted to Rajasthan Hospital on March 15. She was discharged on Friday from the hospital after recovering from Covid-19. She tested negative on Thursday. It is not the first time she tested positive for Covid-19. After participating in a party, she had developed fever and cough on November 15, 2020. On November 17, she tested positive for Covid-19. She recovered with treatment. Again, after a gap of four months, she fell ill with cough and high grade fever. On testing, she tested positive for Influenza A and Covid-19. "The noteworthy aspect of the case is that despite previous infection, one dose of vaccine and good antibodies, the patient developed a moderately severe Covid pneumonia requiring oxygen. Her antibodies were 120, which is also a marker of old Covid-19 infection. Moreover, she has received her first jab of vaccine 15 days earlier," said Dr Sheetu Singh, director, Lung Centre of the hospital. Doctors are worried as she developed Covid-19 second time and this was a reason of concern. "She had been vaccinated 15 days ago. In view of possibility of new strain, we sent samples to SMS Medical College and Pune," said Dr Singh. The doctors found the case of rapidly progressive disease with worsening CT scan shadows and score. Initially she was on oxygen for three days. She was kept in specialized Covid-19 ICU having negative pressure of 50 pascal. With specialized care she improved and became Covid-19 negative. Doctors at the hospital are worried as despite previous infection, one dose of vaccine and good antibodies the patient developed a moderately Covid-19 pneumonia requiring oxygen. The doctors are now waiting for the report from NIV, Pune on clarification of the strain of Covid-19, if it has mutated, or it's a new strain or the same virus circulating in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/unusual-covid-reinfection-case-surprises-city-doctors/articleshow/81713957.cms||---

The state government then announced to scale up the vaccination programme in Maharashtra, especially in these districts.The state officials were awaiting more vaccines and the permission to increase the inoculation centres. The state health minister had put out a demand of 20 lakh doses weekly to scale up the vaccination programme in Maharashtra.The state government had stated on Thursday after receiving 76 lakh vaccine doses that its stock would last only a week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/javadekar-pledges-to-scale-up-vax-supply-after-deputy-cm-dials-him/articleshow/81713968.cms||---

An automobile service station in KK Nagar in Trichy city has come forward to offer a 16% discount for any customer who approaches the service centre with a valid voter identification card. “Till April 4 we are offering a discount for the public and there is a good response so far. We wanted to remind voters about the importance of exercising our constitutional duty and discounts will encourage them,” said K Muthu, proprietor of Samar Car Spa. Meanwhile, Makkal Sakthi Iyakkam on Friday conducted a blood donation camp to sensitise voters about achieving a 100% turnout. The NGO workers also carried placards urging people not to receive cash for voting in favour of any particular political party. While several entrepreneurs said that they were eager to offer discounts for encouraging voter turnout, the surge in fresh infections of Covid-19 is said to be putting them on hold. A major chain of non-vegetarian hotels in Trichy city that announced discounts for voters on the polling day for those who arrive with ink mark on their finger was made to withdraw their announcement over fears of crowding on polling day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/covid-comes-in-the-way-of-incentives-to-vote/articleshow/81714838.cms||---

Both the officials entered the hospitals wearing PPE kits and spoke with the patients and doctors. “We did not find any problem with the patients admitted in these two private hospitals as they desired the treatment. But the checks will be conducted across all the private hospitals to see if the same system was followed so that non-deserving patients are asked to leave and the beds can made available for the people who need admission,” the commissioner added. After the visit Jadhav directed all the private hospitals that are treating Covid-19 patients in Nashik city to provide updated information about the number of vacant beds on regular basis as it will ensure efficient bed management system.“Since Covid-19 cases are rising, the availability of beds has become an issue. Hence, the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) is making all efforts to streamline things. We have asked the hospitals to ensure they that they update the data at least three times in a day. Currently they upgrade it once a day. This does not help us get a clear idea of vacant beds which can beprovided to the deserving patients,” Jadhav said. The NMC has set up a centralized admission system that helps patients get allotment of beds in private hospitals according to the availability. Jadhav also asked the hospitals to display and regularly update the availability of 80:20 Covid beds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/civic-chief-conducts-surprise-checks-at-2-private-hospitals/articleshow/81712401.cms||---

According to GU sources, about 20,000 students took the exam on the first day. At a time when the Covid-19 cases are on a rise in the state, there were claims of social distancing norms not being duly followed by some of the college authorities. Members of National Students Union of India (NSUI) said that the varsity authorities were to be blamed for holding the exams in such testing times if any student were to be infected with Covid-19. While some colleges did not keep hand sanitizers at entry and exit levels and in exam classrooms, others did not keep proper seating arrangements as per the social distancing norms, said an NSUI member. The exam are being conducted in pen and paper (offline) format and more than 100 colleges in Ahmedabad have been selected as exam centres. The exam is conducted for MA, MCom and other programmes for colleges affiliated to GU. In the case of undergraduate exams, the university, after suspending these college-level exams due to the surge in Covid-19 cases, has in a recent decision announced it will continue taking these from April 12. A detailed schedule of exams for the faculties of arts, commerce, science and law for all colleges affiliated with GU will be posted on the university website.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/95-attendance-at-gus-pg-exams/articleshow/81713979.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||IIIT-H researchers develop system to ease preparation of agromet bulletins||Hyderabad: Researchers at the International Institute of Information Technology Hyderabad (IIIT-H) have developed a system that can ease the preparation of agromet bulletins — weather predictions for the next five days to help farmers in agriculture. These bulletins consist of eight parameters — rainfall, temperature, wind speed, among others, and are released mandal-wise. The team’s study revealed that if agromet advice based on temporal weather (weather in a particular time) and conditions are prepared for a single block (mandal), then the same can be used for similar weather conditions in subsequent periods. In the same way, if weather conditions in one mandal for a given period are found to be similar to weather conditions of a nearby mandal, then it is possible to reuse the advice based on spatial data, weather in space, as well. “We found that if advisories are created for the first and second year, the same could be reused up to 80% in the third year. In fact, when both temporal and spatial studies were combined, up to 90% of advisories could be reused by the third year,” said Mamatha Alugubelly, an agricultural researcher, who is working in collaboration with the Agro Climate Research Centre, Prof Jayashankar Telangana State Agricultural University and under the guidance of P Krishna Reddy, head of IT for Agriculture Research and Development Centre (ITARD), IIIT-H. The research team began by collecting 30 years of weather data from Rajendra Nagar weather station. They found similarities in weather conditions over specified periods such as a year, a season, or at different growth stages of crops. To explore similarities in weather conditions at the block level, the team then conducted a series of experiments on 12 blocks for kharif and rabi rice crops over a 5-year period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/iiit-h-researchers-develop-system-to-ease-preparation-of-agromet-bulletins/articleshow/81713976.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Twenty-seven students living in the IIM campus at Balicha in Udaipur were among those tested positive for the coronavirus, while a teacher and a staff member too were found infected. The medical department rushed to the premier B-school campus and collected large number of samples of other students and staff. Since the IIM campus is located at quite a far away location from the city with scattered rural settlements, there is little risk of the contagion spread, sources say. Meanwhile, seven students were tested positive at the Kasturba Government Girls Hostel at Jhadol on Friday. Samples have been collected of the other inmates and contact tracing is being done to check spread of the disease further. Prohibitory orders have been imposed at both locations and the medical teams have been alerted to increase samplings here.

---||Ahmedabad||HC to pass interim order over PIL on fee cut||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court on Friday said it would pass an interim order with regard to the PIL demanding a reduction in fees at aided and private colleges and higher education institutes due to the Covid-19 pandemic. On Monday, the bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice I J Vora had asked the state government to take a final decision and inform the court about the fee cut after two committees, both headed by Justice (retd) Akshay Mehta, recommended a 10% fee cut for aided and private colleges, respectively. Sources said the bench said it would pass an interim order after the state government said that it did not intend to take any decision on the issue of fee reduction and would rather wait for the Supreme Court to give its final verdict on a similar issue involving schools in Rajasthan. The Rajasthan government’s decision to order a fee cut at private schools is under challenge before the SC, which has passed an interim order saying that the schools should be allowed to charge fees in full to those students who are able to pay the fees, whereas schools should provide options such as payment of fees in instalments and partial reduction for those students whose financial conditions have been affected by the Covid-19 situation. Citing the proceedings before the SC on this issue, the government submitted that it would be fit to wait for the final verdict of the apex court. The judges asked the state government whether the committee’s findings and recommendations are not binding on it. This is because the state government has introduced a Fee Regulatory Committees for schools and colleges for past few years by bringing in legislation, and it has been acting on the decisions of these committees. Last year, an NGO filed a PIL and sought HC directions to the government to take a decision to reduce fees at aided and private higher education institutes. The government established two committees headed by Justice Mehta to study the issue and recommend the quantum of reduction in fees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-to-pass-interim-order-over-pil-on-fee-cut/articleshow/81713987.cms||---

Despite continuous rise in cases, experts believe that mortality is far less as it appears that the virus is less virulent after mutations. TOI on Friday spoke to the experts at the SMS Medical College, RUHS and other hospitals to know the intensity of the virus that is affecting more and more people every day. “We are getting cases with very mild to moderate symptoms and recovery is also seen in these patients within a week while they are under home quarantine or are at hospital. Thus, it appears that the new strain is less virulent. Having said that I must say despite all this, people should be more cautious and careful as the active cases are increasing,” said Dr Ajeet Singh, Superintendent of RUHS, who is also part of the core team. He said despite the increase in cases, RUHS has patient occupancy of merely 2.6%. “Against our total capacity of 1,200 beds, we have 74 admissions out of which 12 are ICU patients. So, for the time being we can say the virus through its mutations is less virulent, still we have to be careful,” he added. Echoing similar views, Dr Sudhir Bhandari, principal and controller, SMS Medical College and head of the Covid management and treatment team, said, “So far, we are not witnessing patients with acute severity of the disease. Apart from believing the virus is less virulent, I must say people are now conscious and much aware about Covid and are openly coming for tests in early stage. If patients are coming at early stage, it helps us to deal with the case properly. Earlier, may be patients after seeing deterioration were going for tests and getting admitted, but now with timely detection we have been able to bring down the mortality rate. In Jaipur, there were merely three deaths in past one week,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/virus-less-virulent-now-say-covid-management-experts/articleshow/81713985.cms||Ashish Mehta

---||Hyderabad||One muhurat for all 3 shrines in secretariat: Telangana govt||HYDERABAD: Construction of three shrines will be finished before work on new secretariat gets over, roads and buildings minister Vemula Prashanth Reddy said. He also said foundation stones for the temple, mosque and church on the secretariat premises will be laid soon on the same day. The government has set an 11-month deadline for completion of new secretariat building from the time the work was taken up at the site. The minister informed the assembly on Friday that the government is committed to starting the work on temple, mosque and church on the same day. “The one muhurat decision is in tune with the government’s secular stand,” a TRS leader said. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has already told the officials to increase the plot area for the temple from 300-odd square yards to 1,500 square yards and that of mosque from 433 square yards to 1,500 square yards. The church will come up in 500 square yards. On several occasions during the campaign in GHMC polls, the CM and ministers said the TRS government follows secular ideology while taking a dig at the BJP for trying to polarise voters. Prashanth Reddy said a muhurat would be fixed for the foundation laying of three places of worship as auspicious days are ahead. “We will try to lay the foundation stones for all the religious structures before Ramzan,” he said. He was replying during question hour to AIMIM legislators who urged the government to lay the foundation for the two mosques before the start of the fasting month of Ramzan in mid-April. AIMIM member Ahmed Pasha Quadri said they have confidence that the government would honour its commitment of constructing two mosques at the original sites in the secretariat. Pasha Quadri along with party MLA Moazzam Khan urged the government to announce a specific date for the foundation laying ceremony. Plans for the two mosques have already been submitted to the government by the AIMIM. The foundation ceremony for the mosques scheduled on February 24 was postponed due to poll code, Quadri said. The minister attributed the delay to election code and non-availability of auspicious days for temple foundation. Also, the secretariat premises was filled with gravel dug up for laying basement and foundation for the new secretariat complex. The gravel is being cleared now, he said. The minister also said the mosque plans have been submitted to the Telangana State Waqf Board and that of the temple to the endowments department. “The best of the plans would be finalised,” he said but did not give any assurance that the plans submitted by the AIMIM would be finalised. “If needed, the government will hold a meeting with Muslim religious scholars and AIMIM MLAs to select the best plan,” the minister added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/govt-1-muhurat-for-all-3-shrines-in-secretariat/articleshow/81715714.cms||Roushan Ali

From the existing 34,000 tests per day, the department is aiming at taking it to 40,000 post-Holi. Also, the health authorities have intensified the measures, including contact tracing. Authorities stated that the increase in sample testing and contract tracing will help in early detection that would be helpful in cure and bringing down the mortality rate in the state. A central team in December 2020 had advised the government of Rajasthan to intensify contact tracing and introduce measures like micro containment. “We have already developed testing capacity of 70,000 samples per day in the state,” Dr Ravi Prakash Sharma, additional director (rural health) told TOI. He said the number of testing has been increasing every day. “During January, after the inception of vaccination in the state, people were not coming for testing. Now, they are coming and getting themselves tested even after getting minor symptoms. So, after Holi, measures like contact tracing and micro containment would be intensified in state,” said a senior officer of the health department. Meanwhile, authorities in their recent meetings with police department also requested to re-intensify action against those who are not wearing masks and not following social distancing. “We have started penalising public for not wearing masks. Even at some of the places in the state, roadside eateries and small dhabas were sealed when we found no customer was wearing mask,” said an officer. There has been a continuous rise in cases in districts including Jaipur, Jodhpur, Dungarpur, Rajsamand, Ajmer, Bhilwara and Sirohi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/daily-testing-will-surge-to-40k-samples-a-day-after-holi/articleshow/81713989.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand plans to make Covid-19 negative report mandatory for people coming from high-load states: CM Tirath Singh Rawat||DEHRADUN: The Uttarakhand government is planning to make Covid-19 report mandatory for people coming from the states which have witnessed a spike in cases in the last few days. “If the infections continue to rise, we will make Covid-19-negative reports mandatory for people of states like Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat,” chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat said on Friday. The CM further said, “We will identify places in the state which are recording a rise in the number of Covid-19 cases and if required, containment zones will be made. There will not be a complete lockdown in the state. As for the upcoming Char Dham Yatra, people coming from high-risk states can be asked to show their Covid-19 negative reports (taken not before 72 hours of arrival). The arrangements in this regard are being made,’ he added. The CM is currently under home isolation as he had recently tested positive for Covid-19. When queried about the upcoming Kumbh Mela, CM Rawat said that the guidelines of the Centre would be followed ‘in letter and spirit’. “We are looking at a system wherein vehicles will be parked outside Haridwar and there will be a bus service for devotees coming for the Kumbh,” said the CM. Rawat said there was confusion among the people earlier over the format of the grand religious congregation but he had clarified things. “Soon after taking charge, I made things crystal clear. Everyone can come for Kumbh but all the guidelines will have to be followed,” he added. On whether the announcement of Gairsain as a separate division would be reversed following protests over the matter, Rawat said that the matter has been put on hold and is currently being examined. “No government order has been issued in the matter and it has been put on hold. We will take a decision in favour of the people. The view of people will be respected. We will not take any decision which causes problems to the locals,” said the CM. Rawat also said that health, reverse migration, tourism and infrastructure are his priority areas. He added that since the start of his tenure, he has focussed on improving the healthcare sector of the Himalayan state. “Not long ago, the new Covid-19 cases had reduced greatly in the state but they have increased again. Thus, we need to remain alert and follow all guidelines. A total of 138 new ambulances have been approved. Also, efforts are on to complete the medical colleges of Rudrapur, Haridwar and Pithoragarh at the earliest. We have released Rs 50 crore for Rudrapur medical college. We have also initiated the process to recruit staff for medical colleges. I have directed the officials to initiate the process to recruit 403 doctors and 2,600 nurses by April this year,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-plans-to-make-covid-19-negative-report-mandatory-for-people-coming-from-high-load-states-cm-rawat/articleshow/81713053.cms||Kautilya Singh

Of these, 46.32 lakh got vaccinated with the first dose, while 6.74 lakh received the second dose of the vaccine. On Friday alone, 2.5 lakh people got vaccinated. Till Friday, the percentage of the second dose takers remained low compared to the first dose takers of the vaccine. However, with the arrival of fresh lot of vaccines from the Centre, authorities are aiming at expediting the second dose to health workers and frontline workers. “We had planned 63,301 sessions till Friday since the inception of vaccination on January 16, out of which we could achieve 62,645 sessions till Friday,” said Dr Raghuraj Singh, nodal officer, vaccination, while quoting the figures. Also, on Friday, 35,507 people in the age bracket of 45 to 59 years with co-morbidities and 2.03 lakh senior citizens (60 or above) got vaccinated with the first dose. Authorities stated that the fear among senior citizens and those with various co-morbidities for vaccination is gradually fading away. “Since there have not been adverse events, people in the age bracket of 45-59 with co-morbidities and those who are 60 and above, too, are coming for getting vaccinated in large numbers. This included many who have not registered themselves and are preferring on-the-spot registration by showing their Aadhaar cards,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/over-53-lakh-people-get-vaccinated-in-state/articleshow/81714022.cms||---

He has appealed to people to follow Covid appropriate behaviour. “For the last 8-10 days, the daily positive cases in the district is hovering around 450-500. This is concerning as during the peak last year the number of daily Covid patients didn’t exceed 250. The Covid beds in both government and private hospitals are almost full,” he said. He added that patients had been put on waiting list to get admitted for Covid treatment. Nandurbar is one of the worst-hit districts in Nashik division in terms of the rapid rise in cases but the death rate is low. The doubling time of cases is just 23.5 days and the weekly growth rate is 23. There are 4,500 active patients in the district, most of whom are from the urban pockets. The district has around 1,000 beds, including 450 ICU and oxygen beds. “If the cases start emerging from the rural parts too, it would become extremely challenging for the administration to treat the patients in those parts,” said Bharud. He added that people had enthusiastically supported the lockdown last year. “We expect people to show the same gesture during the janata curfew on Saturdays and Sundays. We have to curb the transmission of the virus under any circumstances,” he stressed. He appealed to the beneficiaries to take the Covid vaccine as quickly as possible. He also said that those testing positive on the rapid antigen test do not require to do the RT-PCR test.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/covid-beds-full-must-follow-norms-nandurbar-collector/articleshow/81712411.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

---||Hyderabad||Conduct exams, resume classes: JAC||HYDERABAD: The members of the Telangana Engineering Students JAC on Friday met the education minister and demanded that the state immediately conduct odd semester examination and resume physical classes so that students can complete their course on time. They said that while it makes sense to stop physical classes for school students, it is completely unnecessary to close engineering colleges as students are capable of following all norms. “Odd semester examinations, which are generally conducted in November, were scheduled in March. Recently, the state had directed the varsities to postpone these examinations. When will these exams be conducted? What about even semester exams? Students, especially final year ones, will be at loss if exams are not conducted on time,” said Sharan Raichur, state president, Engineering Students JAC, adding that exams should be held as per schedule. He added, “The state should direct universities to immediately start next semester classes as there is hardly any time left for the end of the academic year.” Students said that the state should immediately resume physical classes, at least for practicals and labs, and ensure that exams are conducted on time. “We are somehow managing theoretical subjects in online classes but fieldwork/practical/lab or mathematical subjects are way too hard to understand in online classes. Students are facing several problems when it comes to laboratory courses as they have to be done in the college under the guidance of faculty,” said K Anwesh of JAC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/conduct-exams-resume-classes-jac/articleshow/81714020.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Over a dozen MLAs pressurized by cops to go with BJP, says NCP ministers||MUMBAI: A day after minister of state for health Rajendra Patil Yadrawkar claimed that former state intelligence commissioner Rashmi Shukla had tried to influence him to support the BJP after the 2019 assembly elections, two senior NCP cabinet ministers told TOI that a section of police officers had approached over a dozen legislators, independents as well as those from smaller parties, at that time to help BJP’s Devendra Fadnavis form the government. The Maha Vikas Aghadi has accused Shukla, whose secret report of August 2020 on the alleged police transfers racket was submitted by Fadnavis to the Union home secretary on Tuesday, of “working for BJP.” State chief secretary Sitaram Kunte in his report to CM Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday, accused Shukla of “misusing permission given to tap phones for political reasons.” IPS officer Shukla was state intel chief at the time of the 2019 elections. Last year she opted for Central deputation and is now with CRPF, Hyderabad. The NCP cabinet members alleged they knew police officers were approaching legislators and had brought the matter to the notice of NCP president Sharad Pawar at that time. Yadrawkar, elected to the legislative assembly from Shirol in Kolhapur district, was initially with the NCP. However, as part of the seat-sharing formula for the assembly polls, Shirol was allotted to ally Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana, following which he quit the NCP and contested as an independent. He told TOI, “Rashmi Shukla spoke to me and invited me to her office for a cup of tea. Since I was independent legislator, her contention was that I should join BJP for better prospects. She mentioned I would be prosperous and my life would be hassle-free. I did not meet her, but my nominee called on her, and I rejected the proposal. I told her I was not interested in any post but would abide by the wishes of my voters. As an independent candidate, I was elected by a record margin of 30,000 votes. My voters felt I should join Shiv Sena, so I joined Sena.” NCP minister Nawab Malik told TOI that after the Yadrawkar episode, the NCP had alerted most of its senior leaders that the BJP may try to lure pro-NCP legislators. “Though BJP emerged as the single largest party, it had failed to secure the numbers required for formation of government. So it was likely they would knock at the doors of independent legislators. We spoke to Yadrawkar and most independent legislators and they extended support to the Maha Vikas Aghadi led by Uddhav Thackeray,” he said. An NCP minister said, on the condition of anonymity, “It is unfortunate that IPS officers had joined hands with Fadnavis for formation of government.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-over-a-dozen-mlas-pressurized-by-cops-to-go-with-bjp-says-ncp-ministers/articleshow/81714900.cms||---

Their association is demanding a rise of Rs 120 per tanker per trip to overcome the financial loss due to hike in fuel prices in the past couple of months. They also threatened to go on a strike if tariffs are not revised. K Raj Reddy, president of HMWS&SB water tankers owners association, said it is not financially viable for them to operate water tankers at the existing tariff. “We urged the HMWS&SB to revise the tariff to ensure uninterrupted tanker supplies to lakhs of consumers,” he said. He said a delegation will meet the HMWS&SB officials soon and serve a strike notice. “We will stop supplying tankers if our demand to increase the tariff is not met,” he told TOI. Currently, the water board is collecting Rs 500 (for five kilo litres) and Rs 1,000 (for 10 KL) per tanker for domestic and multi-storeyed domestic buildings. Similarly, it charges Rs 850 (for 5 KL), Rs 1,700 (10 KL) and Rs 3,400 (for 20 KL) for commercial and other categories of consumers.The association members met the water board officials and sought revision of existing tariff, which was last revised in 2017. A senior water board official said they will take a decision on tariff only after summer. “The tankers’ association is demanding revision of tariff and we will look into their demand only after summer is over,” he told TOI. He said demand for the tankers has come down after the board launched 20 KL free water supply scheme to residents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/water-tanker-operators-threaten-to-go-on-strike-over-tariff-revision/articleshow/81714026.cms||Sunil Mungara
---||Hyderabad||CM K Chandrasekhar Rao to CJI: 50% cap on quota needs relook||HYDERABAD: Even as the Supreme Court has reserved its judgment on whether its 1992 verdict on capping reservations at 50% needs a re-examination, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has reportedly written a letter to the Chief Justice of India (CJI) with a plea for a relook at the quota cap. Sources in the government said the CM expressed the opinion that a larger bench of the apex court should review the Indra Sawhney judgment on the upper limit for reservations. “There are special circumstances in various states. Some north-eastern states have more than 50% tribals or there are more OBCs in some states. The social fabric also changes over time because of varied population growth rates among different communities,” he reportedly said in the letter. The CM has been arguing for the past three years that the state government should have powers on fixing reservations and the cap on 50% limit should go. He even argued that states such as Tamil Nadu have been providing 69% reservations and the same should be extended to other states. The Telangana government had proposed to enhance reservations to STs from the existing 6% to 10% and Muslims reservations (BC-E category) from 4% to 12%. The government sent the proposal to the Centre after passing resolutions in the state assembly three years ago. However, the Centre did not respond in view of the ceiling on reservations. As the apex court was hearing Maratha reservations and 50% cap case, KCR reportedly opined that there are no provisions in the Constitution on the upper limit for extending reservations. “The 102nd constitutional amendment resulting in insertion of Article 342(A) takes away the powers of the state legislatures to include any deserving communities from time to time in the list of OBCs and to enhance the reservations for different communities beyond 50% fixed by the court in Indra Sawhney judgment,” he is believed to have said. He also urged the Supreme Court to leave it to state legislatures to determine the quantum of reservations. The CM during his speech in the state assembly on Friday spoke about the 50% cap and observed that states should have powers on enhancing reservations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kcr-to-cji-50-cap-on-quota-needs-relook/articleshow/81715761.cms||Koride Mahesh

On Friday, four more students of a private school in Kumbakonam tested positive, taking the total number of students, teachers and parents infected in the district since March 8 to 203. District collector M Govinda Rao said only four to five cases were reported from among the close contacts of students. “As schools and colleges have been given holiday, the school clusters have started to come down. Four cases were reported from Native Higher Secondary School in Kumbakonam on Friday. Other than this, no cases or cluster were reported today,” he added. So far, Covid-19 cases have been reported from 14 schools which include 177 students, 24 teachers and two bus drivers of a private school. Of these, 120 have been discharged from hospitals and 83 are active cases, Rao said. Health workers have been asked to concentrate on contact tracing. On Friday, new cases recorded in the district were 111 which included the 20 students of a veterinary college and research institute in Orathanadu who tested positive on Thursday. The district administration had already slapped a fine of Rs 12,000 on Saraswathi Padasala Girl’s HSS in Kumbakonam for not adhering to SOP laid down by the health department. Police were asked to register a case against Maxwell Matriculation school which also slapped with a fine of Rs 5,000. A committee has been formed by the collector to monitor schools daily and ensure they are adhering to the norms. The recent spike started when a student of a government girls’ HSS at Ammapettai tested positive on March 8.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/no-fresh-school-clusters-in-thanjavur-says-collector/articleshow/81714894.cms||D Vincent Arockiaraj

When queried what he meant by the statement, the former CM told TOI, “I could sense that there was a lot of dismay amongst the people in my constituency Doiwala as they failed to understand the reason why was I removed from the post of CM. Therefore, I felt that there was a need to motivate them and boost their morale.” He added that whatever he said was “simply to boost the people’s morale and nothing more.” “I assured the people that the development work in Doiwala will not be stopped and we will continue to take forward the work we have started,” he said. Rawat further said that he worked with “full commitment to take the state on the path of progress during my tenure.” “I have served as CM for a period of four years and held many other positions in the party prior to that but each time I came out through the dark tunnel of politics without a blemish. The decisions taken by my cabinet will prove a milestone for the state,” he added. On the reasons why he was removed, Rawat claimed that he had no idea on what prompted the decision. “It is a collective decision of the party and I respect it,” Rawat said, adding that it is “part and parcel of a person’s political journey.” “On my part, I can only say that I will always ensure that the people of Doiwala will never have to say that their MLA has committed any wrongdoing during his tenure.” Meanwhile, BJP state in-charge for Uttarakhand, Dushyant Kumar Gautam who was present in Dehradun on Friday, when asked about the statement given by the former CM, said, “He should not be worried. BJP is on expansion mode these days and the party needs experienced people like Trivendra Rawat. We are not a party of one family and hence every leader is an asset to us.” (with inputs from Ishita Mishra)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ex-ukhand-cm-trivendra-rawat-equates-himself-with-mahabharatas-abhimanyu-hints-at-conspiracy-behind-his-removal/articleshow/81713102.cms||Kautilya Singh

The VC had appointed Chakraborti, a former dean of the School of Computational and Integrative Sciences, as registrar on March 17, following which the JNUTA alleged that there was no EC meeting to deliberate on the matter.

---||Patna||0.63% hike in power tariff in Bihar||Patna: The Bihar Electricity Regulatory Commission (BERC) has allowed an average ‘marginal’ hike of 0.63% in electricity charges under its annual power tariff order for fiscal 2021-22 announced on Friday. The BERC has also reduced the number of slabs in the tariff structure for domestic consumers from four at present to three. The slabs of 201 to 300 units and 301 and above have been merged and made ‘201 and above’. Besides, the existing fixed charges has been kept unchanged for all categories of power consumers. A proposal for rebate of 3% for the prepaid smart meter consumers has also been accepted by the commission. Also, those making delay in paying electricity bills will have to pay 1.5% per month delayed payment surcharge. The power tariff order has been passed on zero-subsidy basis, which means that the tariff rate may further come down after the state government announces subsidy. The practice of zero-subsidy tariff petition was introduced from the fiscal 2016-17. The state government will now take a decision on subsidy by March 31 as the new tariff order will be effective from April 1. Sources said the per unit hike in power tariff for the urban domestic power consumers would be in the range of 5 to 35 paise. For the first 100 units, it has approved Rs6.10 per unit against existing tariff rate of Rs6.05 per unit (without subsidy) while it would be Rs6.95 per unit against current Rs6.85 per unit for 101-200 units slab. For above 200 units, Rs8.05 per unit would be charged compared to the existing rate of Rs7.70 per unit for 201-300 units and Rs8.50 for above 300 units. “The two power distribution companies (discoms) in the state — North Bihar Power Distribution Company Limited (NBPDCL) and South Bihar Power Distribution Company Limited (SBPDCL) — had proposed around 9.22% hike in the retail electricity tariff, but the commission has allowed an average increase of 0.63% in different categories of power consumers,” BERC chairman Shishir Sinha told reporters. He added: “The two discoms had proposed the total net annual revenue requirement (ARR) of Rs18,552.95 crore and total revenue gap of Rs1615.41 crore for the fiscal 2021-22. However, the commission, after thorough examination of the proposals and prudence check, has approved the combined ARR of Rs17,962.43 crore and combined gap of Rs115.36 crore.” The BERC attributed the reason behind the ‘nominal’ hike in power charges to revenue surplus from sale of power by discoms in fiscal 2020-21 and lower transfer of expenses on aggregate technical and commercial (AT&C) losses onto the consumers. “The discoms had pegged their average AT&C losses at 30-35% in their respective tariff petitions, but the commission has allowed only up to 15% of the distribution loss to be transferred onto the consumers as per the guidelines set by Centre’s Uday scheme,” a BERC official said. The commission fixed 15% as the ‘distribution loss trajectory’ for both the discoms in the fiscal 2021-22. The average power purchase cost of the two discoms is Rs4 per kilowatt hour (kWh), whereas the average cost of supply for discoms is Rs7.44kWh. Power tariff for domestic urban power consumers: Slab —— existing rate/unit — Revised rate/unit 0-100 —— Rs6.05 —————-Rs6.10 101-200 —- Rs6.85 —————- Rs6.95 201-300 — Rs7.70 —————-Rs8.05 300+ ——Rs 8.50 ———-(merged Rs8.05)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/0-63-hike-in-power-tariff-in-bihar/articleshow/81714046.cms||Piyush Tripathi
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Sachin Waze destroyed 5 cellphones after Mansukh Hiran’s body found, says NIA||MUMBAI: Two police inspectors and a senior police officer of Mumbai police are under the scanner and are likely to be summoned by the National Investigation Agency in a day or two in connection with Mansukh Hiran’s murder case. Sachin Waze, the key accused, has reportedly told NIA that on March 6, a day after Hiran’s body was found, he destroyed five mobile phones, including his official one. The NIA is taking help of experts to retrieve data of Waze’s official mobile phone, which would be digital evidence in the HIran case. Sources said Waze was using 13 mobile phones. The NIA is investigating the case of explosives found in a Scorpio outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence on February 25 and the subsequent murder of the vehicle owner, Hiran. His body was found in Mumbra creek on March 5. A hotelier, whose statement was recorded by NIA on Thursday, has reportedly told the agency that on March 3, when he went to hand over ‘hafta collection’ to Waze in his CIU office, he had seen Hiran, Waze, arrested constable Vinayak Shinde and a police inspector of the crime branch in a meeting. Sources said NIA wants to question this inspector as to what he was doing in the CIU office though he was attached to another unit. The NIA also wants to question a senior police officer who had allegedly called up a businessman from South Mumbai to pay a bill of Rs 13 lakh for Waze’s 100-day stay in a five-star hotel. The businessman told NIA he had lodged a complaint that a jeweller had cheated him of Rs 50 or 60 lakh, and the senior officer had told him that if he paid the hotel bill, Waze will help him recover his money. The ATS probe has found the plot to kill Hiran was hatched on March 2 during a meeting Waze held with two colleagues at the police headquarters. ATS has handed over a detailed investigation report, which stated the Gujarat-based SIM card which Waze used to call Hiran to Ghodbunder Road in Thane posing as Tawde was switched on at 8.20 pm in Thane and then its movement was seen till Andheri East, where it was switched off at 10 pm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-waze-destroyed-5-cellphones-after-hirans-body-found-says-nia/articleshow/81714917.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Delhi||HC junks plea over exam fee waiver for classes X, XII||New Delhi: Refusing to interfere in a policy decision, Delhi High Court on Friday dismissed a PIL seeking fee waiver for poor children studying in classes X and XII at government schools. The plea argued that children from economically backward families won’t be able to afford the board exam fees and sought a direction to the Aam Aadmi Party government to pay as it had done in the past. A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jasmeet Singh, however, said there was no right for full or partial waiver of examination fee and it is for the government to take a call if it can foot the bill based on the facts and circumstances of each year and the other priorities of the administration. The court said it was not inclined to direct the government to fully or partially waive the exam fees and saw no reason to entertain the petition filed by a group, Parents Forum for Meaningful Education. The group was contending that the CBSE “arbitrarily” enhanced the exam fees in 2019-20 and was charging the same in 2020-21, too, when everyone has been hit financially by the pandemic. In 2019-20, Delhi government had decided to bear the burden of the exam fees of students studying in classes X and XII in its schools, the plea said, arguing that CBSE charges Rs 1,500 as board exam fees for classes X and XII, and the amount goes up to Rs 2,400 for science stream students as they also have practicals. The petition contended that in the prevailing situation, parents of children in government schools may not be able to pay such amounts in one go. “It has emerged that respondent 2 (Delhi government) has not only failed to sort out the matter as promised last year, but this year it has declined to meet the steep fee obligation, thereby abandoning lakhs of children in classes X and XII in its schools,” the petition claimed. The high court, however, remained unconvinced.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-junks-plea-over-exam-fee-waiver-for-classes-x-xii/articleshow/81714913.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Dehradun||BJP MLA to be anointed ‘mahamandaleshwar’ by Niranjani akhada||HARIDWAR: Niranjani akhada, one of the largest Naga sanyasi akhadas of Shaivite sect, has decided to anoint Suresh Rathore, the BJP MLA from Jwalapur in Haridwar, as the akhada's 'mahamandaleshwar'. Rathore, who is a prominent Dalit leader of the area, belongs to the Sant Ravidas sect and the move, political analysts say seemed to have been made to appease the Dalit community ahead of the assembly polls next year. The MLA, unlike other 'mahamandaleshwar', will not take sanyas (renunciation) but will participate in the upcoming 'shahi snan' during the Kumbh as part of the akhada, a privilege usually reserved for seers. Secretary of Niranjani akhada Mahant Ravindra Puri said that Rathore is a ‘religious person’ and the akhada's senior seers have therefore decided to anoint him as mahamandaleshwar and rituals as per set traditions will be performed before the forthcoming shahi snan in April so that he can “take part in the grand event with his supporters.” Meanwhile, Rathore told TOI, “I already hold the title of Ravidasacharya and am honoured that I have been chosen to become a mahamandaleshwar of the Niranjani akhada. I will follow all the rules and traditions of the akhada. Along with supporters, I will also take out a procession on April 3.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/bjp-mla-to-be-anointed-mahamandaleshwar-by-niranjani-akhada/articleshow/81713111.cms||MS Nawaz

---||Hyderabad||E-voting possible by 2024 general elections: CEC||HYDERABAD: Chief  commissioner Sunil Arora said e-voting could be a part of changes that are likely to be implemented in the next general elections in 2024. Stating that the Election Commission of India along with IIT Madras is working on blockchain technology for remote voting, the CEC said significant developments in e-voting are expected by 2024. Speaking to IPS trainees at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Police Academy in Hyderabad on Friday, the CEC said: “Though ‘one nation-one election’ is desirable, it is difficult to achieve till the basic laws are amended.” He also stressed that political consensus must be arrived at before pushing for simultaneous polls at national and state levels. Sunil Arora said the commission is working on linking Aadhaar card with voter ID as part of electoral reforms. Replying to a question of one of the IPS probationers on ‘one nation-one election’ theory, Sunil Arora said: “One nation-one election is a desirable goal. Unless you align the life of Parliament with the life of the state legislatures by amendments of the law, it cannot happen.” The NPA has decided to deploy trainee IPS officers in the upcoming elections in Kerala, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Assam to give on-field experience to the probationers.

---||Patna||Bihar: Minor brothers murdered by stepbrothers for property||PATNA: After searching for more than seven hours, police recovered the bodies of two kidnapped brothers aged five and seven years respectively, from two separate canals at Janipur and Naubatpur in Patna on Friday morning. Shivam Kumar and his elder brother Anish Kumar's bodies were found packed inside jute sacks, police said. The brothers were allegedly killed over a property dispute between their father and stepmother. Shivam’s body was recovered from a Son river canal under the Naubatpur police station area, while Anish’s body was recovered from the Punpun river at village Dharaichak under the Janipur police station area. City SP (West) Ashok Mishra said Shivam and Anish were kidnapped from near their home at village Mukhdumpur under Bihta police station of Patna around 2.30 pm on March 23. “The recovery of the bodies became possible after police arrested their stepbrothers Saurav Prakash (22) and his younger brother who has claimed to be a minor," Mishra said, adding, they were arrested from Janipur around midnight on Thursday. “They were evading arrest. Both confessed to killing the minors by strangulating them and dumping their bodies. Based on their confession, the bodies were recovered after a search of almost seven hours. This kidnapping for murder was the fallout of property greed,” he added. The Neora police outpost in-charge, Dharmendra Kumar, said Sunita Devi (45), the mother of two accused, was also arrested from her home at Walmi under Phulwarisharif police station after the bodies were recovered. She is the ex-wife of Vinod Kumar, the father of the two slain boys. “It was she who had instigated her sons to kidnap the minors and kill them over the greed of her husband Vinod Kumar’s property,” he said. “Vinod had lodged an FIR against the trio suspecting they had kidnapped Shivam and Anish intending to murder. However, till then Saurav and his minor brother had killed the children,” he said. He said Vinod and Sunita had separated more than 10 years ago. “Vinod later married one Sudha Devi from whom Shivam and Anish were born,” the police officer said. The in-charge said that Vinod, who works as an accountant at a brick kiln, divided his property and gave a share to Sunita for her children after his second marriage. “Everything was going normal until Saurav and his minor brother started visiting Mukhdumpur for constructing a house on a land which their mother had got as share after separation from Vinod,” he said. He said both kidnapped their stepbrothers in their SUV and throttled the duo to death one by one inside the vehicle within the next few hours. “The SUV owned by Saurav used in the crime was also recovered by the police,” he said, adding, police were informed about the kidnapping around 9 pm on March 23.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/minor-brothers-murdered-by-stepbrothers-for-property/articleshow/81714079.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Ambaji Patil (65) passed away around 10.30pm and within 30 minutes Sunandabai (58) succumbed too. “It was heartbreaking to see them pass away around the same time. A relative of theirs thought she was probably shocked to see her husband pass away. But both were on non-invasive ventilator and the prognosis wasn’t good,” a doctor said. The Patils died before the fire broke out at Dreams Mall. As the hospital authorities were carrying out the paperwork to release their bodies, the fire alarm started to go off. Both were admitted 4-5 days ago. “Covid had affected 90% of their lungs,” said the hospital’s chief medical officer. The Patils were not from Mumbai. Their son, a policeman, is said to have shifted them to the city for better treatment. “At their native place, there was an explosion of Covid cases and many had died,” a hospital staffer said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/couple-died-30-min-apart-before-blaze-in-mumbai/articleshow/81713156.cms||---

The proposal was approved and now will be sent to the lieutenant governor Anil Baijal for the final approval. “Earlier the BJP-led central government promised to provide a job to a member of late Ankit Sharma’s family, but eventually denied any such opportunity. Now the Kejriwal government will be providing a job to his brother,” the government said in a statement. Earlier, while meeting the family of the late IB officer, Kejriwal promised a government job to one of the members.

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand BJP chief regrets using govt chopper‘unintentionally’ to attend party event, says BJP will pay for chopper use||DEHRADUN: Days after facing flak for using a government helicopter for his visit to a party event in Bageshwar, BJP's Uttarakhand president Madan Kaushik on Friday said that “this shouldn’t have happened and it was done unintentionally.” Kaushik added that the party will pay for all the expenses incurred by the government for his chopper ride. “My visit to Bageshwar was planned along with a minister who reached the place a day earlier than scheduled. As I had some work, I opted for the helicopter which shouldn’t have happened,” Kaushik, who was addressing a press conference in Dehradun, said. He added that the party’s co-incharge for Uttarakhand, Rekha Verma was on a visit to Nainital along with a minister, but later “due to certain circumstances, had to use the government chopper as well.” “Our party has spent four years in power without any scam or wrongdoing. Now, we have collectively decided that this shouldn’t have happened and we will pay for all the expenses incurred on the chooper use,” Kaushik said. The state BJP president received a guard of honour - usually reserved only for senior government ministers - by the district police after he had landed in Bageshwar earlier this week. While the Bageshwar SP has ordered a probe, Kaushik said he had no knowledge that he would be given the honour. A day later, Rekha Verma had also used the government chopper. On the controversy relating to the guard of honour, Kaushik said, “When I reached Bageshwar, a police contingent gave me the guard of honour. I have become the party chief for the first time and I couldn’t make out whether my post deserves this honour or not. When I found out that party chiefs are not entitled to guard of honour, I realised that whatever happened was wrong. I will ensure that this does not get repeated in future.” Talking about BJP’s plans for the upcoming bypolls in the Salt assembly constituency, Kaushik said that the party will soon declare its candidate. He further said that the BJP has given the bypolls’ responsibility to six leaders - state minister Dhan Singh Rawat, Nainital MP Ajay Bhatt, Almora MP Ajay Tamta, cabinet minister Yashpal Arya, Badrinath MLA Mahendra Bhatt and former Almora MLA Kailash Sharma. They will stay in the constituency and help the candidate in devising the poll strategy, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/uttarakhand-bjp-chief-regrets-using-govt-chopperunintentionally-to-attend-party-event-says-bjp-will-pay-for-chopper-use/articleshow/81713150.cms||Ishita Mishra

According to hospital officials, this is the first case of Doege Pottery Syndrome in the country (and only the fourth in the world). A 62-year-old woman from the city, Khairunissa Begum was referred to Osmania General Hospital (OGH) with symptoms of weakness, abdominal swelling, abdominal pain, sweating and incoherent behaviour. Doctors were surprised to find a huge tumour occupying three-fourth of the liver (size 20 x 18 x12 cms). The tumour was causing hypoglycaemia, bringing her blood sugar levels below 40 mg/dl repeatedly.“The biopsy from the tumour confirmed the Doege Pottery Syndrome. This is an extremely rare condition in which the tumour produces insulin like growth hormones which causes blood sugar levels to go as low as 25—40 mg/dl,” said Dr Ch Madhusudan, professor and HOD, surgical gastroenterology, OGH.

---||Mumbai||Apex court reserves order on Navlakha bail plea in Mumbai||The Supreme Court on Friday reserved its order on social activist Gautam Navalakha's plea for grant of default bail in the Elgar Parishad case. A bench of Justices U U Lalit and K M Joseph reserved the order after hearing the plea of senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for Navalakha, and Additional Solicitor General S V Raju who opposed the bail plea on behalf of NIA. Navalakha approached the apex court after the Bombay High Court rejected his plea for bail in the case. Sibal contended that the HC erred in rejecting the plea and default bail be granted to him as the NIA failed to file its chargesheet within the prescribed time limit of 90 days. He contended that the period for which he was under house arrest should also be calculated as part of judicial custody and taken into account while deciding the total period of custody. The NIA, however, had contended that the period of 34 days of Navlakha’s house arrest between August 29 and October 1, 2018, was termed ‘illegal’ by the Delhi High Court and hence it cannot be included in the period of detention. The SC will decide whether the period of his house arrest be counted while calculating period of his custody before the chargesheet was filed. Navlakha is facing charges, with others, for alleged links with banned Maoists outfits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/apex-court-reserves-order-on-navlakha-bail-plea-in-mumbai/articleshow/81714967.cms||---

It all began on March 20 during a revelry at a wedding procession in UP's Shamli district. There was a dispute over celebratory firing between the accused Gullu and Sonu Prajapati, a youth tending the horse cart in the procession. The argument took a fatal turn after Gullu, in a fit of rage, drew his country-made weapon and shot at Sonu who collapsed at the spot. He was rushed to a local hospital and later referred to a higher centre in Meerut where he eventually succumbed to his injuries. Police initially claimed Sonu died after he was accidently hit during celebratory firing at the wedding procession, but the subsequent investigation brought the murder angle to the fore. "As Gullu's name surfaced during the investigation, he went into hiding and was arrested on Friday, seven days after the incident. A local pradhan who helped him in escaping has also been booked in the case," Sukirti Madhav, Shamli SP, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/man-arrested-for-murder-police-initially-thought-it-was-case-of-celebratory-firing/articleshow/81713163.cms||---
---||Goa||Dayne tests Covid +ve, loses chance to qualify for Olympics||Panaji: Dayne Coelho’s dream of making it to this year’s Olympics in Tokyo has been shattered after he tested positive for Covid-19, just hours before he could board the flight to Oman where the final Asian qualifiers are scheduled to take place. Pitted against the might of competitors from Oman, Thailand, Philippines and India, Goa’s ace windsurfer was confident he could emerge on top and qualify for the Olympics to be held from July 23 to August 8. However, hours before he could take the flight to Oman from Mumbai, there was bad news for him. Results showed he tested positive for Covid-19. “Dayne was shocked,” his father Donald told TOI on Saturday. “He had taken all precautions, there were no symptoms and the last thing we wanted before such an important event was to hear that he is Covid positive.” Due to his Covid-19 status, Dayne was unable to take the flight. His father said he did not rely on the first test done in Mumbai, so opted for another test. “The result (on Saturday) did not surprise us. Dayne tested negative,” he said. It was, however, too late to book another flight for the Asian qualifier. The tournament starts April 3 and all participants were asked to report by March 25 to mandatorily quarantine themselves for seven days. Dayne’s plan was to travel to Oman on March 24 and then undergo quarantine. Travelling without his father for the first time, he would have had some time to train and acclimatise. “He was quite positive. During preparations here, he was telling us that he was feeling he’s at his best. His fitness was top-notch,” said Donald. The champion windsurfer was also hassled because sudden changes to equipment requirements meant he had to run from pillar to post to source new equipment. It was only thanks to intervention from the Goa Yachting Association that his equipment was in place. Early this year, Dayne had emerged champion in the RS:X Olympic category at the Open Navy Windsurfing Championship 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/dayne-tests-covid-ve-loses-chance-to-qualify-for-olympics/articleshow/81728358.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

Both housing minister Awhad and skill development minister Malik reacted, terming Fadnavis’s comments as “objectionable and amounting to contempt of the chief secretary.” Fadnavis, while speaking to the media, said, “I know the chief secretary very well. He is a straightforward officer. It is evident from the content that the report was drafted by minister Jitendra Awhad, and Kunte signed it and presented it to the chief minister.” He said the report was full of fallacies. “The citing of the Indian Telegraph Act in the report is done for the convenience of the government. Under the Act, the incitement to commencement of an offence which allows an official to intercept phone calls (but it) is deliberately skipped in the report. The ACB uses these provisions under ITA all the time, and ACB has permission to tap phone calls to monitor offences,” Fadnavis said. He denied leaking the official document. “I presented to the media only two pages of the letter of Rashmi Shukla. The entire 6.3 GB data I had submitted in a sealed envelope to the Union home secretary,” he said. “And who leaked out the detailed report? Nawab Malik himself did, and even the leaked pages clearly show 12 transfers actually happened as we see in the transcripts,” Fadnavis said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-kunte-report-ghostwritten-by-ministers-says-fadnavis/articleshow/81714970.cms||---

People may also find it difficult to get cash from ATMs during this period because the machines will be replenished only on the working days. “Banks will open only for three days (March 30, 31, and April 3) during the next eight days because of public holidays and annual closure, said United Forum of Bank Unions spokesperson Anil Tiwari. Customers can access banks only on March 30 and April 3, he added. Officials said according to RBI notifications, banks will be closed on March 27 due to the fourth Saturday of the month followed by weekly off on Sunday and Holi holiday on March 29. The regular bank works will be conducted on March 30, but services will remain suspended for people on March 31, even though it is not a holiday on account of the last day of the financial year. It will be followed by two consecutive holidays on April 1 for the closing of accounts and April 2 on account of Good Friday. Banks will open on April 3 but remain closed on April 4 again due to weekly off on Sunday. Normal work will resume from April 5, they added.

A senior officer of a nationalised bank told TOI that arrangements will be made for replenishment of ATMs on all working days.

---||Hyderabad||For India to prosper, economics must supersede politics: KTR||Hyderabad: If India has to prosper over the next decade and transform into a powerhouse, economics should supersede politics and the Centre should support progressive states like Telangana, KT Rama Rao, IT & industries minister, Telangana, said on Friday. “The Centre needs to realise that in a federal republic like India, giving proper support to a state that is performing will ultimately help the country. The stronger the states emerge, the stronger our country will be,” he said during a virtual fireside chat on ‘States to watch out for in the next decade’ at the India Economic Conclave 2021 organised by Times Group. Here he pointed out that India has immense opportunities to emerge as a global player in sectors like IT, life sciences, defence, aerospace, textiles, and logistics, but that will be possible only if the Centre collaborates with performing states like Telangana to start thinking and planning on scale to compete with large manufacturing nations like China. “Telangana is a performing state which is contributing to the growth of the nation and it’s time the government of India take us into confidence and work together…GoI should play the role of a big brother, bring us all into one room, ensure we work together as a team, and support us, but it’s not happening now, unfortunately,” he said. Pointing out that the spirit of team India will serve good only if words are translated into action, he said: “We assumed office six years back when the NDA government assumed office in Delhi. Sadly, their slogans are not being converted into an actionable point.” KTR said not only has the Centre failed to keep its promises to Telangana, which contributes nearly 5% to the country’s GDP, its policies too seem to be “disincentivising and demoralising” for performing states like Telangana, which should be encouraged and made part of centrally-sponsored schemes. “Except praises, Telangana never got any monetary support,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/for-india-to-prosper-economics-must-supersede-politics-ktr/articleshow/81714084.cms||---
---||Patna||CM Nitish Kumar opens Nature Safari, cabin ropeway at Rajgir||BIHARSHARIF: Chief minister Nitish Kumar on Friday inaugurated two of his dream projects at Rajgir – Nature Safari and new cabin ropeway. Developed by the department of forests, environment and climate change department with an expenditure of Rs 19 crore, the Nature Safari is spread over an area of 500 acres in the hills of Rajgir. It is located in thick jungles on Rajgir-Jethian Buddha Marg. The various recreational amenities at the Nature Safari include suspension bridge, zip-lining, rock climbing wall, archery range, wrestling zone, watch tower and children’s park. Glass bridge, the main attraction of the Nature Safari, is 200-foot-high and 85-foot-long. It will accommodate 40 visitors at a time. The bridge has been built on the lines of the 120-metre-high glass bridge in Hangzhou province of China. “This the first glass bridge in the country,” Nitish said. He added the idea of Nature Safari came to his mind when he was laying foundation for a Zoo Safari at Rajgir. “I wanted the Nature Safari to be developed near the Zoo Safari. However, the plan could not materialise due to technical reasons. Apart from recreational values, the Nature Safari will educate visitors about nature and environment,” he added. Asked about the Zoo Safari, Nitish said animals have already started coming to the facility. “More animals will be brought to the facility in the coming weeks. It will take some time for the animals to get accustomed to the weather and climate here,” he said. Some cottages have also been developed at the Nature Safari, allowing visitors to hire them for night stay. Meanwhile, Nitish also inaugurated the new cabin-type ropeway near the existing ropeway at Rajgir. The facility will make trips to Vishwa Shanti Stupa atop Ratnagiri Hills comfortable and enjoyable for visitors. The 191-metre-long gondola ropeway has been installed by Rail India Technical and Economic Service. The new ropeway has 20 cars attached to it. Each car can accommodate eight passengers. The project has been implemented with an expenditure of over Rs 20 crore. The existing chair lift ropeway with 101 chairs attached to it was inaugurated along with Vishwa Shanti Stupa by the then President, V V Giri, on October 25, 1969.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cm-opens-nature-safari-cabin-ropeway-at-rajgir/articleshow/81714110.cms||Farrukh Nadim

However, he was not able to provide any details about these patients. The GMCH administration has denied the allegations. Bawankule, while addressing a press meet, said that bed shortage has become so intense in the city that four patients died without beds in GMCH premises in a single day on Thursday. “People have died due to shortage of beds in hospital premises. Tomorrow, they will start dying on the roads because of the government’s failure to handle the crisis,” Bawankule said. However, when asked about details of the deaths, his team was unable to provide them. Later, they said that Bawankule was referring to news that appeared in some local vernacular newspapers. The allegations made by former power minister of Maharashtra created sensation in the health administration. Divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar immediately directed the GMCH administration to conduct enquiry in the matter. By Friday evening, GMCH dean came out with an official denial about Bawankule’s claims. “The news that four people died in our hospital due to non-availability of beds on March 25 is not true,” reads the statement by dean Dr Sudhir Gupta. “Many a times, very severe and critical patients are referred to GMCH by private hospitals. Such patients are shifted in critical conditions and some of them die during hospitalization. But, the claim about four deaths on March 25 are not true,” the statement concludes. However, Bawankule countered the GMCH claim by saying that they are under pressure of senior authorities. “By issuing such a statement, GMCH is hiding the real figures due to pressure from above. If they say that there were no deaths due to shortage of beds, then they should provide Thursday’s death statistics and which category of patients died,” Bawankule told TOI. While authorities have outright denied any deaths due to bed crisis, sources at GMCH told TOI that it’s possible that patients may die while waiting for admission. “There is a never-before crisis of beds in GMCH. Many patients who arrive in serious and critical condition with Covid-19 positive report are dying even before admission,” said a senior official. ‘Guardian minister has left Nagpur in trouble’ Bawankule said Maha Vikas Aghadi’s entire focus is on Pune and Mumbai. “Our guardian minister (Nitin Raut) must stay in Nagpur till this crisis is over. He has left everything to the administration but it does not work that way. He must sit at the collector’s office for at least 12 hours a day and coordinate every moment to ensure that the machinery is working,” said Bawankule. He added that the first mistake by MVA was not anticipating the second wave. “All across the world a second wave has come. Even MVA knew at least a month before that a wave is coming, but they did not prepare for it. Now they are scrambling to convert MLA hostel into a centre, trying to grab hold of mangal karyalayas etc. It’s a failure of planning,” said Bawankule.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/gmch-denies-bawankule-claim-4-died-awaiting-bed-on-thursday/articleshow/81713194.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Lucknow||Lucknow: 10-fold rise in Covid-19 cases since March 15||LUCKNOW: As the exponential rise in the Covid-19 cases continued, the city on Friday recorded 347 new infections, the highest number to be reported in four months since November 26. The more concerning part was that the disease also claimed two lives in the past 24 hours, taking the toll since the outbreak to 1,199. According to the state Covid bulletin, only 57 patients recovered in this period, resulting in active infections zooming to 1,648. Of them 1,276 were in home isolation. As per the CMO office report, the cases, earlier confined to a few localities, are now being reported from across the city. Highest 28 cases were recorded in Hazratganj followed by Indiranagar 23, Alaiganj 22, Alambagh 20, Gomtinagar and Manaknagar 18 each, Talkatora 16 and Madiaon 16 each, Mahanagar 15, Chowk 14, Jankipuram 13, Hasanganj and Aashiana 11 each and Bazaarkhala 10 among others. Experts attribute the spike to non-adherence to safety protocols by a substantial number of people in the state capital which has witnessed an almost 10-fold increase since March 15. In fact, every third new infection and death in the state on Friday took place in Lucknow. In the rest of the 74 districts in UP, new cases were below 55, they pointed out. Among the two patients who died, one was a 55-year old woman who died at KGMU. Also suffering from diabetes and hypertension, the patient was admitted on Friday in a critical state and died within hours, said officials. DM Abhishek Prakash visited a containment zone in Narahi and also took stock of the Covid situation in the city. NER, UPED offices sealed: The office buildings of UP Secondary Education Directorate (UPED) and North Eastern Railways (NER), Lucknow Division, were sealed till Monday after several staff members in both the establishments tested Covid-19 positive. In UPED, 15 staff members, including eight officers, were found to be infected during contact tracing after a few employees tested positive on Thursday. At NER, in a similar contract tracing driver, about 21 staff members, including five officers, tested positive. Both the buildings were also sanitised. Another fully vaccinated doc tests +ve: Principal of Era’s Lucknow Medical College and Hospital, Dr MMA Faridi, who had taken his full vaccination course of two doses, also tested positive for novel coronavirus infection on Friday. He is the 13th healthcare professional in the city to have been infected after taking the Covid vaccine. “He has mild fever and has been admitted in the Covid hospital for observation as a precautionary measure,” said college spokesperson Wasi Asghar. He also informed newspersons that Dr Faridi is also a part of a college study to find out how much time antibodies take to develop after vaccination. “Tests revealed that as of now, he has not developed enough antibodies,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/10-fold-rise-in-cases-since-march-15/articleshow/81714975.cms||---

But the same has suffered badly due to the rising cases and restrictions that followed. Many hospitals where vaccination was underway are left with no option but to stop or limit the inoculation process due to the increasing number of Covid-19 cases, burdening the manpower utilized for treating patients. On the other hand, some hospitals, where the vaccination is still on, are facing problems of insufficient walk-ins. “We used to vaccinate 200 persons every day, two weeks ago. In the last three-four days, the turnout has gone down to 30-35 per day,” said Dr Ashok Arbat, director of KRIMS Hospitals and chairman of Vidarbha Hospitals Association (VHA). “Many private hospitals enlisted as vaccination centres are attached to the VHA. I have been receiving feedback from most of our members that footfall has significantly declined,” he added. While they are not ready to come officially on record, many private hospitals in the city admitted that they have either limited or stopped vaccination after sudden surge in Covid-19 cases. As the footfall has gone down, the set-ups installed by these hospitals like waiting arena etc remaining unused. Unofficially, many hospitals have started vaccination of 45+ people without checking for their comorbid conditions. TOI has first person accounts of several beneficiaries who are 45+ and having no comorbidities and yet got the jabs. Also, a few under-45 people have also managed to get themselves vaccinated in some cases. Doctors told TOI that vaccination of healthy people has become important now. “It’s a welcome decision that government has allowed all 45+ people to get the vaccine from April 1. But, lockdown-like restrictions have affected the vaccination programme. Some innovative steps are a must now to promote vaccination,” said physician Dr Abhay Chopde. The district administration has the power to take decision locally about vaccine beneficiaries. While pharmacists were included in the frontline workers category in Nagpur, journalists, irrespective of age, were given jabs in Amravati. In Chennai, community vaccination at housing societies and social group level is allowed. Such innovative ideas will improve vaccination coverage. TOI asked for some such suggestions to expert doctors and got valuable inputs. Doctors said there must be some innovative steps like making vaccination of all visitors mandatory before organizing a marriage function, vaccine passport for train/bus travel, and involving private sector in the inoculation drive. Experts also suggested that government should allow more vaccine options to those who can afford to buy it at higher prices. Vaccine Must, Ideas Too Chennai pattern: Let housing societies, community groups hold mass Covid vaccination camps Jab for 18-45: Exclude past RT-PCR +ves, conduct antibody test, and offer vaccine to those who don’t have antibodies Vaccine events: Allow events like wedding, small gatherings with compulsory vaccination of all who attend Private vaccine: Make vaccine available in hospitals on private distribution basis for those who can pay market rates Other vaccines: Allow vaccines approved in other countries (like Moderna, Pfizer etc) to be administered to those who can afford it||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/vax-drive-hit-hard-as-cases-rising-need-innovative-steps-to-speed-up/articleshow/81713199.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

The two sisters had quarrelled about who would keep the phone overnight at their home in Itwa Pachrukhi village under Dharhara police station of Munger district. The deceased Sandhya Kumari had written her matriculation examination this year. DSP (probationer)-cum-Dharhara police station SHO Nawal Kishore said Sandhya was found hanging in the storeroom by her younger sister. "Sakshi is hardly 11 years old," the SHO said, adding, she woke up around 4 am and found her elder sister hanging in the storeroom. "One of their aunts had gone for a morning walk and the rest of the members of the joint family were asleep. No one realised when Sandhya woke up and hanged herself," Kishore said. SHO Kishore, quoting Sandhya’s mother, said that had been asking for a separate cellphone for herself. "The mother said she didn’t purchase a separate one as she didn’t have that much financial capacity to provide separate phones to both daughters and keep one for herself. The entire family used one smartphone over which both sisters had a tiff on Thursday night," he said. "The mother intervened when the sisters fought and kept the phone with herself instead of giving it to any one of them and all went to sleep," he said. The SHO said Sandhya had used one of her scarves as a noose to hang from a ceiling fan inside the storeroom. "The village chowkidar was informed about the incident by 6 am soon after which police reached the spot. Till then, her body was brought down by family and neighbours," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/girl-hangs-self-after-tiff-with-sister-for-cellphone/articleshow/81712922.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Prataya not only visited some primary health centres (PHCs) to ascertain the availability of paramedical staff and drugs, but also met family members of the children who were infected with the deadly virus under Kanti block in Muzaffarpur in 2019. During the review meeting, he directed the officials concerned to train teachers of the government schools in the worst affected areas to make the children aware of the virus and precautionary measures to deal with it in the district. Muzaffarpur civil surgeon Dr Suresh Kumar said it was decided to tag all the private ambulances and other vehicles with the nearby hospitals to provide transportation to the children from villages to the nearest health facility. In addition, the principal secretary gave his approval to pay in cash to the drivers of the private ambulances or vehicles carrying the affected children to the hospitals from their respective villages. “We have been told to keep in touch with the family members of those children who got infected last year,” he said. It was decided at the meeting to send voice messages on their mobile phones thrice a day to alert them about the precautions to be taken at their houses during night and day time. “The process of collecting mobile phone numbers of the families is underway,” Kumar told this newspaper over phone on Friday. The civil surgeon said the team members expressed satisfaction over the awareness campaign launched in the affected areas. “But the principal secretary stressed the need of wall paintings at panchayat level as part of the awareness campaign about the AES,” he added. The 10-member team comprising some health experts from Unicef visited different health facilities under Musahari, Minapur, Kanti, Muraul and Kudhani blocks of the district and inquired about the preparations to deal with the exigency. Pratyaya appreciated the ‘adopt village’ programme launched by the district authorities in AES-hit blocks in Muzaffarpur. In 2019, ovr 150 children had died due to AES, also known as ‘chamki bukhar’. Last year, about three dozen children had died due to the deadly virus. Later in the evening, Prataya held a meeting with the DMs of 12 districts under Tirhut, Darbhanga and Saran divisions through videoconferencing and inquired about the vaccination drive under their jurisdiction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/train-teachers-to-make-kids-awareof-steps-against-aes-health-team/articleshow/81712942.cms||Ramashankar

---||Agra||Dhaba encounter: SSP removed, iquor mafia & constable arrested||AGRA: Days after the fake 'dhaba encounter' in Uttar Pradesh, the state government, on Friday, has removed Etah SSP Sunil Kumar Singh, and attached him to the DGP office. Ten men were allegedly picked up from a local eatery in Etah after a dispute over payment of bill last month. Meanwhile, UP Police has nabbed liquor mafia Bantu Yadav who helped cops stage the fake encounter and in recovery of arms, illicit liquor and contraband from the arrested men. Police constable Shailendra Kumar has also been arrested while search for Kotwali Dehat SHO Indreshpal Singh and another constable Santosh Kumar is on. Talking to TOI, additional director general of police Rajeev Krishna said, “On basis of the complaint received from the eatery owner, an FIR was registered against the three cops found guilty in preliminary investigation. One of the accused constables, Shailendra Kumar, and local resident, Bantu Yadav, were arrested on Friday. Bantu has a past criminal record. The accused SHO and another constable of Kotwali Dehat police station will be arrested soon. The entire case is being probed by officials of the Aligarh district." The eatery owner, Praveen Kumar Yadav, who is specially-abled, had alleged that on February 4, two constables had refused to pay Rs 400 bill after eating food. “They were offering only Rs 80. My elder brother requested them to pay at least Rs 200. Some of the customers also asked them to pay the bill. Following an argument, the policemen started beating my brother. They were drunk and threatened to send us to jail.” Yadav added that after the argument, constables left the eatery on Agra Road. “Soon, 15 policemen arrived and took my brother and cousin along with eight customers to Kotwali Dehat police station and registered an FIR against them.” In the FIR, they alleged that the 10 people were part of an organised gang and were hatching a plot to loot. Police also claimed that they were held following an encounter. In the recovery, local police showed six illegal weapons, 80-litre illicit liquor and 2kg contraband. And that the "gang" had fired six rounds. Among those picked up from the 'dhaba' were Kumar’s elder brother Pushpendra Yadav, 34, and cousin Deepak Yadav, 24. It also included East Champaran resident Rahul Kumar Singh and his three friends, who were having food when the cops arrived. Singh, 26, a businessman, has been granted bail while his friends are still in prison. “They took us from the 'dhaba' on the pretext of questioning. But inside the police station, they thrashed us and took our belongings. They fired country-made weapons inside the police station premises and later showed them as recovered from us. The 'ganja' was also arranged by the cops. I was kept in jail for around 40 days and my friends are still inside,” Singh alleged. Later on Friday, following a rumour that the police were about to kill the arrested liquor mafia Bantu Yadav in an encounter, over 100 people from Bantu’s village Dareegpur arrived in five tractors and staged a protest outside the Kotwali Dehat police station and the district magistrate's residence. Senior police officials assured the villagers that the accused will be sent to jail soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/dhaba-encounter-ssp-removed-iquor-mafia-constable-arrested/articleshow/81713225.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Lucknow||Pandemic-hit tourism begins to soar again||Lucknow: The tourism and hospitality sector was the first to be affected by Covid-19 and subsequently the lockdown and will be the last to recover from the crisis. While the industry is still taking time to revive completely and come to normal, experts say that domestic tourism — array of holiday packages by tour operators and weekend-getaways to little known places in the country —is seeing a surge. City hotels have started offering a wide range of staycation offers with complementary breakfast, culinary food walk with 3-course Awadhi dinner and early-check ins and late check-outs. Pre-lockdown, the hotels used to offer such discounts and offers mostly during festival time. But, post-lockdown the hospitality industry has worked on strategies and several SOPs to bring their customer clientele back. "Local travellers are looking for getaways within their city or somewhere near. We have several inquiries from people nearby about the staycation since travellers are looking for a safe and sanitized environment to enjoy a small break from their mundane life. Corporate travel has also picked up a bit. Embracing this new trend of domestic travelling we have introduced these offers," said Joyjit Chakravorty, general manager of a hotel in Gomtinagar. A 4-star hotel on Kanpur Road has encouraged staycation with pick up and drop from the airport and all refreshments or meals on the house. Meanwhile, another a 5-star hotel in Gomtinagar has a special deal where a customer will be rewarded with 10-25% off on their stay when he books the hotel by April 2, 2021, for stays through September 12, 2021. The offer comes with a flexible cancellation policy too. “After being confined indoors for almost months due to lockdown, people and travellers are doing what we call 'revenge tourism'. They are moving out on weekends, they want to see little known or unexplored places since the lockdown gave them ample time to surf their vacation spots. Tour operators and hotels have also understood the need of their clients and therefore, ideating discount and special packages, designating hygiene managers, tying up with healthcare professionals are benefitting the industry slowly but readily,” said Prateek Hira, chairman of Indian Association of Tour Operators. People are also adapting to the new normal of wearing a mask and getting themselves tested before setting out on a journey.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/pandemic-hit-tourism-begins-to-soar-again/articleshow/81714993.cms||Aditi Singh
---||Nagpur||Unicef & Maharashtra’s ‘story telling’ initiative a success||Nagpur: A ‘story telling’ initiaitve started in October last year by the Maharashtra government and UNICEF has impacted the lives of many students in remote rural areas who have borne the brunt of schools being closed. TOI was the first media house to report how Goshtincha Shanivaar (Saturday storytelling sessions) was a hit among Gadchiroli students who flocked to the school’s courtyards every Saturday to listen to their teachers telling specially curated and age-appropriate stories.Earlier this month, while celebrating ‘World Storytelling Day’, a special online seminar on Goshtincha Shanivaar was organized by all the stakeholders of the project. The State Council of Educational Research & Training, Maharashtra (SCERT), Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS), UNICEF and Pratham Books’ StoryWeaver marked ‘World Storytelling Day’ with an online symposium to celebrate the success of the ‘Goshticha Shaniwar’ reading programme. ‘Goshticha Shaniwar’ was a 5 month-long initiative for the children of Maharashtra to encourage learning through stories, which, especially during the extended school closures, was critical in promoting children’s mental & emotional well-being, and in supporting their language development. Nearly 2.6 lakh teachers and anganwadi workers and 1 lakh schools and anganwadis across Maharashtra participated in the programme, impacting 25 lakh children.Every Saturday, one storybook in Marathi was shared for anganwadi children. A set of four age-appropriate storybooks in each of the three languages — Marathi, Urdu, and English — was shared with children from grades 1 to 8. These e-books were curated by the StoryWeaver team and were then shared via WhatsApp through a tiered dissemination model involving officials, teachers, parents and volunteers, who then shared the books with the children using online and offline channels. The storybooks were supported by interesting activities based on concepts from the stories, to encourage greater engagement. Since the books were openly licensed, they were free to read, download, print, project, adapt and share. The event also included the unveiling of a book that captures the programme’s model, impact and sustainability, and voices from the field. Presiding over the event, Varsha Gaikwad, the state’s school education minister, said, “We have a responsibility towards nurturing our children to achieve their potential, and stories are an important part of a child’s growth and development. The education department is committed to building on this, and creating a vibrant reading culture in the schools of Maharashtra.”Terry Durnnian, Chief Education, UNICEF India, said, “With the prioritisation of Foundation Literacy as part of NEP 2020, it is imperative that a print-rich environment be made available for children in pre-schools and schools, where the culture of reading is promoted. UNICEF is committed to supporting the state in continuing this campaign and to ensuring that children have interesting books and time to read, not just every Saturday, but every day, in school and at home. Once the skill to read develops, children can truly become lifelong learners.”Suzanne Singh, chairperson, Pratham Books, said, “Storybooks can play a vital role in building foundational reading skills and promoting children’s emotional well-being. Our Reading Programme offers openly licenced storybooks, with grade-appropriate themes featuring diverse topics. We adapted this for ‘Goshticha Shaniwar’, and thanks to the power of open licencing, these books were read online, downloaded, printed and shared for free. We are grateful to our partners SCERT, ICDS, UNICEF and the network of wonderful educators and volunteers who helped take these books to the children at such a challenging time. It is their dedication to keeping the children’s learning journey alive that has helped ‘Goshticha Shaniwar’ and our books reach the farthest corners of Maharashtra.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/unicef-maharashtras-story-telling-initiative-a-success/articleshow/81723115.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Goa||Shigmo parades cancelled in view of rising Covid cases||PORVORIM: With the number of Covid-19 cases showing a sharp increase over the last few days, the state government on Friday cancelled the Shigmo festival parades, which were scheduled to be held in the first week of April. Making the announcement, chief minister Pramod Sawant said that Shigmo festivities organised by temple and village committees will be allowed to go ahead on the condition that Covid SOPs are followed. “Considering that cases have started increasing in the state and because at the end of the day everyone’s health is very important, the public Shigmo parades, which the government used to organise, have been cancelled,” Sawant said while speaking in the state legislative assembly. The chief minister said that the same rules would apply for Holi, with no public celebrations permitted. “Religious Shigmo festivities that are held in temples and in villages can go ahead, but in a limited manner with restrictions. Public Holi celebrations which are planned will not happen, and if it is in a hotel, there must be restrictions. Even though gulal is a public festivity, we ask people not to do this. No public events should be held,” Sawant said. Shigmotsav, is Goa’s spring festival, and is celebrated over a fortnight with parades, floats, dance performances, plays and gulal. MGP MLA Ramakrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar brought up the issue in the House and asked the government to immediately provide clarity since people had already begun preparing for Shigmo. The tourism department had planned to organise Shigmo parades in three cities in the first week of April. Sawant said that the state would compensate all the participants and groups who had begun working on the floats and the parade. “Those who need to be compensated for what they have spent, we can compensate them just as we did last year,” the chief minister said. “Seeing the situation in Goa and in view of the Covid-19 cases, Shigmo will not be held this time, even though the decision to organise Shigmo parades was taken about two months back. This is a sensitive issue, and the government wants to take this seriously. Covid has come before us and we need to take care of people’s health,” tourism minister Manohar Agjaonkar said. Sawant said that temples and village groups that plan to go ahead with Shigmo festivities can do so without taking any additional permissions. “They should just ensure that all SOPs are followed, such as wearing of masks and social distancing. Whether it is Shigmo or any other festival, there needs to be a limit on the numbers. Even for weddings and birthday parties, all must follow SOPs,” Sawant further said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/shigmo-parades-cancelled-in-view-of-rising-covid-cases/articleshow/81715020.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Multi-faith festivals to be celebrated amid Covid-19 protocol on Sunday||MUMBAI: Sunday March 28 brings a confluence of three festivals of communities, Holi, Shab E’Baraat and Palm Sunday, which marks the start of Holy Week leading to Easter. All communities have devised Covid-appropriate protocol for the occasion. Neptune Society in Thakur Village, Kandivli, has decided to forgo its annual Holi gathering in the compound. A resident Shekhar Batham said, “The children will play outside as usual, but the society party is canceled. Several senior citizens live here and their health cannot be compromised. As it is, the society has seen sporadic cases of infection in the past months.” The intervening night of March 28-29 witnesses the holy festival of Shab E’Baraat when Muslims seek forgiveness for their sins and visit graveyards all night to pray for the redemption of their dear departed. This year, all mosques have made it mandatory to wear masks. Bada Kabrastan in Marine Lines will close by 11pm. Haji Ali dargah, the tomb of the holy saint, will also be off bounds from 10pm on Sunday till 6am on Monday. Since a high tide is expected between 11pm on March 28 and 6am on March 29, the dargah has decided to keep its doors closed during that period. At Friday prayer, the trustees of the Andheri Muslim Kabrastan Masjid at Four Bungalows, Andheri, also made an announcement urging people to complete their visit by 11pm. “We have requested people to follow the guidelines relayed to us by the local D N Nagar police,” said trustee Atik Bhai Kashmiri. Approximately 25,000-30,000 people arrive at this graveyard at Shab E’Baraat through the night until 5.30am. Trustee Atik Bhai said, “Even ordinarily it is very difficult to control the crowd. We must be more careful now due to the renewed Covid-19 outbreak.” Churches too will eschew or shorten rituals associated with Palm Sunday. Fr Frazer Mascarenhas, parish priest of St Peter’s Church, Bandra, said no palms will be distributed since these could be a source of infection. Palms will be used, however, at the masses that will be live-streamed on Saturday and Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-multi-faith-festivals-to-be-celebrated-amid-covid-19-protocol-on-sunday/articleshow/81714997.cms||Bella Jaisinghani
---||Goa||Tied at the top, Churchill Bros forced to settle for second spot||No sooner the final whistle was blown, goalkeeper Shibin Raj fell to the ground. Clayvin Zuniga showed no emotion. He simply shook hands with all those around him, while coach Fernando Varela went across to his Punjab FC counterpart and completed the formalities. Churchill Bros had survived a second-half fightback from Punjab to win 3-2 at the Vivekananda Yuba Bharati Krirangan in Kolkata. This was their first win in four matches. This was what was needed of them in the concluding league clash. But as the table showed, this was still not enough. Churchill finished their league engagements with 29 points, the same as Gokulam Kerala FC. But the Kerala side enjoyed a better-head-to-head record and walked away with the trophy after putting it across TRAU 4-1 in a match that was played simultaneously. For about 30 of those 90 decisive minutes, Churchill had moved to the top. There were hopes they could defy the odds and become champions. It all started with Luka Majcen scoring a penalty in the eighth minute for his 11th goal of the league. Zuniga made it 2-0 in the 25th minute and at the end of the first half, it was 3-0 with the Honduran striker finding the mark again. Less than ten kilometres away at the Kishore Bharati Krirangan, TRAU took the lead in the 24th minute to give themselves a massive boost and puncture Churchill. Churchill were again thrown a lifeline when Gokulam equalised in the 70th minute. If the match had finished with no more goals, the Goans would have won their third I-League title. But that was not to be as the eventual champions scored three goals in seven minutes to have the last laugh. Churchill were keeping one eye on proceedings in the other game. Till the 70th minute, they believed they had a chance, even though Punjab had scored two to cut the deficit through Joseba Beitia and Baba Diawara. No sooner word reached them that Gokulam had surged ahead, they knew it was all over. The Goans, though, have nobody to blame. Varela’s side has been impressive this season, remaining unbeaten in 11 matches, including the entire first phase. But eventually it’s the two consecutive losses – against Gokulam (0-3) and Mohammedan Sporting (1-4) – that made the difference. This is not the first time Churchill have finished runners-up, despite having the same number of points as the champions.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai needs to be watched for 2 wks before any hard decision says Doctor||MUMBAI: A doctor who attended the Covid review meeting with CM Uddhav Thackeray on Friday said many ideas were floated, from restricting train movement in suburban Mumbai to a lockdown. Another task force member, Dr Gautam Bhansali, said there is no question of a lockdown at the moment but various restrictions could be announced. “It has been decided that Mumbai needs to be closely watched for two more weeks before any hard decision is taken,” he said. Thackeray chaired the meeting with district authorities to review the state’s preparedness to tackle the second wave, mainly focusing on ramping up medical infrastructure. He also empowered the district authorities to impose localised lockdowns in their areas if cases are spiralling. “I don’t want to impose a lockdown, but given the daily numbers, there is a possibility that the health infrastructure we have created will fall short. People should understand that the threat hasn’t receded, it has only gone up,” said Thackeray. He offered the example of UK, where a lockdown was clamped for two months after the second wave. Local administrations in areas around Mumbai have already started imposing restrictions. The Mira Bhayander-Vasai Virar commissionerate on Friday prohibited gathering of four or more persons under section 144 of the CrPC till April 6. Crowds were feared for Holi, Shab-e-Baraat and Easter. In Kalyan-Dombivli, municipal commissioner Dr Vijay Suryawanshi ordered that all shops, except those selling essentials, hotels and restaurants to remain closed on weekends. Only food parcels will be allowed. In vegetable markets, only 50% shops will open. The Palghar district administration banned weddings after April 15 and said those earlier can take place between 7am and 7pm with permission from the local police station. It issued several restrictions from April 5 — malls, shops and establishments can operate from 7am to 7pm, hawkers between 7am and 8pm, bars and restaurants can be open from 7am to 9pm, and home deliveries have to be over by 10pm. Schools, colleges and coaching classes will be shut, but Class X and XII board exams will take place according to schedule. All religious places will have to be shut by 7pm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-needs-to-be-watched-for-2-wks-before-any-hard-decision-says-doctor/articleshow/81715004.cms||Bhavika Jain

The zoo was closed for the public last year due to the lockdown and the reopening was delayed after cases of bird flu were detected. Due to the pandemic, only online booking of tickets will be allowed and the number of visitors on a day will be limited to around 1,500 to 2,000. A number of steps were taken at the zoo during the closure period, like increasing the number of species and developing it as a birding site and garden with 100 tree species for educating children. Ramesh Pandey, director for the zoo, said, “After two consecutive surveillance tests that were negative for bird flu, the zoo was declared out of the epicenter zone. However, for strictly enforcing Covid-19 guidelines visitors can stay in the zoo during morning and evening slots of four hours each,” Pandey said. Zoo officials said wearing masks, sanitisation of hands and maintaining social distancing would be mandatory inside the campus. When the zoo was closed for the public, the authorities concentrated on improving the habitat of animals and adding more species. The number of zoo species of birds, mammals, reptiles and amphibians rose from 83 to 88 through animal exchange programmes and officials said they are trying to increase the total species count to 100 by April. The population of captive animals and birds also rose from 1,005 to over 1,100. The new species brought here are a Bengal tigress from Kanpur zoo, a sloth bear from Bilapsur zoo, birds from Chandigarh and two striped hyenas from Jaipur zoo. Chinkaras and Ostriches from the Chandigarh zoo may soon arrive here too. “We have added huts in the arena of animals to provide them shade during the summer. A beautification drive is also underway and zoo walls have been painted with pictures of animals while dustbins will be painted on Saturday,” said an official. Apart from watching the captive animals and birds in the zoo, the authorities are taking efforts to add more attractions. “We are developing the campus as a birding site where birders, environment lovers and school children can site free-ranging birds of different species,” said Pandey. The director said that the zoo has also released an e-book on the free-ranging birds spotted here. “Besides, we are developing a lawn where 100 tree species will be planted. It is designed to educate school children about trees through different games. Plans to introduce ‘walk through woods’ programme at the lawn where children would be asked to trace hidden treasures by identifying tree species are also on.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hear-em-roar-zoo-to-open-after-covid-bird-flu-pause/articleshow/81715014.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Bhopal||Sunday lockdown extended to five more cities in Madhya Pradesh||BHOPAL: Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Friday announced extension of Sunday lockdown to Vidisha, Ujjain, Gwalior, Narsinghpur and Saunsar also. Chouhan was reviewing Coronavirus situation at a high-level meeting at the Mantralaya. Chief secretary Iqbal Singh Bains, director general of police Vivek Johri, additional chief secretary health Mohammad Suleman and additional chief secretary, home, Rajesh Rajora were present in the meeting. It was revealed in the meeting that Coronavirus cases have doubled in the state in the last one week. There are 11,168 active cases. The average positivity rate of Coronavirus in the last one week is 6.3%, which is higher than the country’s weekly average rate of 4.6%. In a district-wise review of Coronavirus situation, it was found that maximum number of new cases is 612 in Indore, 425 in Bhopal, 156 in Jabalpur, 83 in Ujjain, 65 in Ratlam, 63 in Gwalior, 60 in Khargone, 60 in Betul, 54 in Sagar, 44 in Sagar, 37 in Barwani, 35 in Chhindwara, 33 in Narsinghpur 33, 27 in Shahdol, 26 in Balaghat and 22 in Shajapur. The remaining districts have less than 20 cases. Most of Coronavirus patients are in home isolation. Chouhan instructed that hospitals in all districts must ensure the best possible treatment for Coronavirus. Arrangements for shifting home isolation cases to the hospital must be ensured, if such a need arises, he added. Chouhan said that we are adopting a three-pronged strategy to deal with Coronavirus infection in the state. The first is to take all measures to prevent infection, the second is to provide the best system of treatment for Coronavirus in hospitals and the third is to speed up vaccinations in the state, so that Corona crisis can be contained. He further said that total lockdown cripples the economy and leaves people jobless. “We will make all possible efforts not to damage the economy and ensure to take the state safely out of Coronavirus crisis.” Chouhan said that public awareness is very important to avoid Coronavirus infection. For this, the ‘Mera Mask-Meri Suraksha’ (My mask-my protection) campaign is being conducted in the state. Under this, masks are being distributed among the people and they are being made aware of the importance of wearing masks. Wearing a mask gives 90% protection from Corona. He further said that to ensure that Coronavirus infection does not spread, everyone should celebrate the upcoming festivals at home with devotion and faith. Chouhan said that Holika Dahan and Shab-e-Baraat should be celebrated symbolically in the districts where there are more than 20 cases of Corona. Special care should be taken to ensure that no crowd is formed anywhere. Chouhan said that everyone must wear masks, follow social distancing, keep hands clean, keep on sanitizing and get vaccinated as per schedule. The mask protects from getting infected, social distancing does not make a person Corona carrier, sanitizers kill the Coronavirus. vaccination creates immunity in body against Corona. Therefore, to avoid Corona, all these precautions must be taken.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/sunday-lockdown-extended-to-five-more-cities-now/articleshow/81713255.cms||---

His daughter Harsha, who was waiting for his remains at M T Agarwal Hospital in Mulund, couldn’t believe their lives turned upside down in a matter of hours. Bhagtani, his wife Basanti and their younger daughter were admitted to the Mulund jumbo facility on Monday evening after they tested positive. Following a cardiac episode, the doctors at the jumbo hospital advised he be moved to a higher facility. After scouting for beds in several hospitals, the family finally found a spot at Sunrise, where he was shifted around 10.30pm on Thursday. The fire broke out around 12am. Harsha said she and her husband accompanied him in the ambulance as he was being moved to Sunrise. “There were tears in his eyes. He was scared how he would fight Covid but I managed to calm him. I never knew that would be the last I would see or speak to him,” she said. As news of the fire broke, they started calling the hospital at 1am. Early on Friday, fire brigade officials gave them the names of five hospitals. “We finally found him in M T Agarwal at 10.30am wrapped in a bedsheet backened with smoke,” she said. A resident of Mulund Colony, Bhagtani was known for social work, even during the pandemic.tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-78-yr-old-dies-2-hrs-after-hospitalisation/articleshow/81713260.cms||---

For SGPGI, the RT-PCR report should not be older than three days while for KGMU, a negative report will be accepted if it is up to seven days old. Both super specialties have decided to run a restricted OPD, limiting the number of patients to be seen everyday. SGPGI will allow 50 patients per department in its OPD, of which 20 patients will be new and the remaining 30 will be follow-up patients. For KGMU’s super specialty wing, 75 patients per department will be allowed from March 30. This figure includes 25 new patients and 50 follow-up patients. “For our broad specialty departments like general surgery, paediatrics, general medicine and others, 150 patients per department will be taken in on a day. Of these, 50 will be new and 100 follow-up patients,” said KGMU spokesperson Dr Sudhir Singh. For in-patient department services at both KGMU and SGPGI, a mandatory Covid RT-PCR test report has to be brought in by the patient and one attendant. SGPGI also reopened the gates to its e-OPD service, saying that patients with prior registration through e-OPD service on the institute’s website and phone numbers will be given priority. KGMU will only be taking in patients who have got their registration done online before their physical visit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/negative-covid-report-must-for-visit-to-pgi-kgmu/articleshow/81715001.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Aurangabad||Aurangabad gets its first public bicycle parking stand||Aurangabad: The Aurangabad Smart City Smart Development Corporation Ltd (ASCDCL), after laying the dedicated bi-cylce tracks, has installed the first public bicycle parking stand in the city — in front of Kranti Chowk-based flag post. The authorities said that the cycle stand has been installed through the corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds of an industrial house. City’s first cycle track from Kranti Chowk to Railway Station was laid in January under the Cycles4Change Challenge introduced by the Smart Cities Mission. Subsequently, Aurangabad was shortlisted as a finalist in the challenge among 107 cities across India. The ASCDCL now plans to take up other plans to make cycling safe and convenient for the residents of Aurangabad. The plans include setting up of bicycle parking,introduction of public bike sharing system for Aurangabad city and app-based route guide. The ASCDCL is also analysing different routes analysed for developing the cycle tracks. ASCDCL CEO Astik Kumar Pandey said that if they want to encourage more and more people to take up cycling it is important to provide the last mile connectivity. “While we are working on developing cycle tracks, the cyclists should have an option to park their bike. At Kranti Chowk, we have installed the stand near the Smart City Bus Shelter so that one can park the bike there and board the bus to travel a longer distance,” Pandey said. Smaeer Kelkar, CEO of the company that provided the fund, said that the stand is designed with a metal tube structure because it is better to tie the entire cycle frame with chain lock to leave in a public place. “The ones with only back wheel locked tend to have lesser safety,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-gets-its-first-public-bicycle-parking-stand/articleshow/81714999.cms||---

He had tested negative for Covid-19 on March 23 and was even moved out of the ICU into a regular ward. “My father-in-law was a cancer patient and had recently fallen down. So, a steel plate had to be fixed into his leg. He could not walk or move on his own and required support to even get up from bed. He was admitted on March 13 after testing positive for Covid-19. He was recovering and was to be discharged in a day or two,” said Tushar Shah, his son-in-law. Shah said he was very weak as his cancer was detected 8 years ago. “The patients who could move ran towards to the terrace and the others who were too old and weak died. The hospital management did not take care of the patients in this hour of crisis,” he said. Javedchand was rushed to Mulund’s M T Agarwal Hospital where he was declared dead around 3:45am on Friday. The body was sent to the civic-run Rajawadi Hospital for an autopsy. “We had to put the body in an ambulance on our own at M T Agarwal Hospital. He had tested negative for Covid so a post-mortem was done. There was no help from the hospital authorities at all. Had they taken care, he would have survived. We had not managed to find any beds in any other hospital in Mulund, so we had to admit him at Sunrise Hospital in Bhandup,” Shah said.tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-74-yr-old-tested-ve-was-to-be-discharged/articleshow/81713265.cms||---

More arrests of the gang members are likely to follow soon on the basis of confession by the suspect, said police. The suspect, Shrikant alias Ashok Kanchya Bhosale of Shelgaon in Sonpeth, was nabbed by a team led by local crime branch inspector Vyankatesh Alewar on the basis of CCTV footage. “Police have recovered 250 grams of gold and 1.725 kg of silver from the accused,” Parbhani superintendent of police Jayant Meena. Police said different teams have been formed for zeroing in the criminals whose names the arrested suspect has revealed their names during questioning. The suspect has been handed over to the Manvat police station for a robbery case registered in their jurisdiction. Police said the suspect was caught on CCTV along with his accomplices while committing a property offence. Ten of the 11 offences were committed by this gang last year that are registered at police stations in Pathri, Manvat, Gangakhed, Palam and Pimpaldevi. Police sources said that soon after learning about the arrest of Bhosale, his accomplices, including some hardened criminals with several offences registered against them, have gone underground. The sources said that such gangs sell the booty to select jewellers, who immediately melt them, making it almost impossible for police or even the owner of the ornaments to identify them||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/parbhani-cops-nab-youth-solve-11-property-crimes/articleshow/81715006.cms||Mohammed Akhef

---||Nagpur||Vaccination centres increased but city’s turnout continues to decline||NAGPUR: The city has been recording a consistent fall in daily Covid vaccination though it now has 74 centres many of which are open up to 10pm. Five more big hospitals got approval to run Covid inoculation centres in the district. Two are in the city, taking the tally to 76. Since the last four days, the figures have not gone beyond 6,500 from a high of 15,000 last week. On Friday, 6,229 took the jab. The two city hospitals — Kingsway and Alexis — are non-empanelled under the government scheme but were among the 10 proposed by municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B. NMC chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar said the two hospitals were approved as they have more than 100 beds. Regarding the decline in vaccination, Dr Chilkar said, “Private hospitals have got busy with Covid and their vaccination numbers are not encouraging. The rest of the beneficiaries are preferring government centres as the rush too has gone down. The city was able to achieve a high of 15,000 innoculations in a day because of the good response at private centres,” he said. Dr Chilkar said earlier they took 20 to 25 vials each having 10 doses but now they are taking only two or three per day. “People must create awareness and emphasise its importance and how it saves one from severe Covid,” he said. The six 24x7 centres demanded by mayor Dayashankar Tiwari in every assembly constituency will be finalized on Saturday. However, insiders questioned the move since the numbers are falling and centres don’t see much rush till 10pm. Civic officials said the scenario is likely to be the same in view of the upcoming festive season. Meanwhile, the NMC received 60,000 doses on Friday. The proposal for 30 more private centres is still pending, Kingsway Hospital director (finance) Nilesh Mundada said, “We are fully prepared and take 700 to 800 vaccinations per day. We would hold it from 8am to 10pm and started from today itself. There are 3 different wings for Covid, non-Covid and vaccination. All three activities would be done smoothly,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/vaccination-centres-increased-but-citys-turnout-continues-to-decline/articleshow/81713279.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

---||Agra||Bharat Bandh: All western UP cities witness protests, highways blocked briefly||MEERUT/AGRA/PILIBHIT/RUDRAPUR: All the cities of western Uttar Pradesh and those in the plains of Uttarakhand witnessed protests on Friday as farmers squatted on state and national highways for a few hours and raised slogans against the Centre for bringing three agriculture laws. Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) had given a nation-wide ‘Bharat Bandh’ call which evoked good response in Punjab and Haryana, and a mixed one in UP and Uttarakhand. In Muzaffarnagar -- the headquarters of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) -- farmers blocked several roads, including the one connecting Delhi to Dehradun, for over two hours before dispersing. Even as they blocked the highways, the protesters allowed vehicles carrying essential items to pass. Meerut and Baghpat also saw protests at various crossings. Traffic was disrupted on Delhi-Yamunotri Highway in Baghpat when farmers placed tractor trolleys in the middle of the road. The blockade was cleared by 3pm. In Bijnor, farmers blocked entry points to the city at Ganga barrage and at a few more places in the district. Talking to TOI over phone from Ghazipur border, spokesperson of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha, Jagtar Singh Bajwa, said that the movement will go on. “On March 28, we will burn the copies of farm laws all across the country on occasion of Holi.” State general secretary of BKU, Thakur Ram Avtar Singh, said in Bijnor, “We are sitting here against the three agriculture laws and non-consideration of our demand on formation of a law on minimum support price (MSP). We also demand immediate withdrawal of cases filed against the farmers.” BKU president Naresh Tikait had announced just a three-hour road blockade in the region to ensure that people don’t face inconvenience. While in Punjab and Haryana, the blockade was for the entire day. “It causes a lot of problems to travellers and we did not want that. The main aim was to make our voices heard, and that is being done. A three-hour ‘bandh’ is enough for that," Tikait has said. The protesters also tried to block the Yamuna Expressway in Mathura. They were stopped by police at Raya crossing, Mathura. Later, the farmers staged a protest on Raya-Hathras road underpass of the e-way and blocked the traffic. Heavy police force was deployed along the expressway to prevent farmers from blocking it. BKU’s state vice president, Buddha Singh, who led the protest in Mathura, said, “We allowed passage to all emergency vehicles while staging the protest. We understand the problems of people, but this government is not ready to listen to us.” In Aligarh, farmers blocked Aligarh-Palwal road. While in Pilibhit, protesters blocked the Pilibhit-Basti national highway for two hours. In Uttarakhand’s Terai region, the ‘bandh’ call evoked a mixed response. In the towns of Udham Singh Nagar district, markets were shut till 1pm. Markets in Bazpur, Kashipur, Nanakmatta, Gadarpur and Sitarganj towns were shut till afternoon and protests were held. The grain markets, however, remained closed throughout the day. The farmers also took out a protest march. President of Terai Kisan Mahasabha, Tejender Singh Virk, said, “People from all walks of life have supported the call. They have extended unconditional support to the ongoing farmers’ movement at various Delhi borders.” (With inputs from Sandeep Rai, Anuja Jaiswal, Keshav Agrawal & Aakash Ahuja)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/bharat-bandh-all-western-up-cities-witness-protests-highways-blocked-briefly/articleshow/81713283.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Rhea FIR: No SC relief for Rajput’s sister||MUMBAI: Supreme Court on Friday dismissed a petition by Priyanka Singh, sister of late actor Sushant Singh Rajput, against a recent refusal by Bombay high court to quash an FIR lodged by Rhea Chakraborty accusing her of getting ‘bogus medical prescription’ via telemedicine. The bench of Chief Justice of India S A Bobde and Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian dismissed in one line her special leave petition (SLP). In February, the HC had quashed the same September 7, 2020 FIR against Rajput’s other sister Meetu Singh. The FIR was quashed for being based only on suspicions and “vague allegations” said the HC, but in Priyanka’s case it had held, “We cannot overlook the serious allegations made in the complaint and material on record and the fact that investigation is in progress.” “From the reading of the complaint and material on record, it is seen that the allegations are primarily against Priyanka Singh and Dr. Tarun Kumar,” the HC bench had said in their judgement, accepting prima facie the invocation of provisions under the NDPS Act in the FIR against Priyanka Singh. “The complaint primarily proceeds on the allegation that the banned medicines prescribed by Dr.Tarun Kumar was at the behest of petitioner No.1 (Priyanka) who had knowledge that the banned medicine and heavy doses of medicine may result in chronic anxiety attack which may damage the health of Sushant Singh Rajput,” the HC had said. Aggrieved, Priyanka had approached SC with an SLP for permission to challenge the HC judgement. Her SLP said it was “one of the rarest of rare cases” where the complainant—Rhea—withdrew her “main case” on September 14. It further said the HC had “overreached its power by examining allegations placed before the police through media reports.” The SLP said the HC had failed to consider that the FIR lodged with Mumbai police was illegal and sans jurisdiction as “no second FIR could have been registered after the inquest proceedings by Maharashtra police were closed.” Her case was that despite the CBI, which is investigating all cases related to the death of the actor, “clearly saying that no case was made out”, the HC did not quash the FIR. Her SLP relied on a SC ruling of 2014 to contend that the September 2020 FIR was registered after a delay of 91 days and without any preliminary inquiry, the conduct of the state smacked of “malice and vengeance’’ as Rhea herself is an accused in the case filed in Patna for abetment of Rajput’s suicide. Rhea’s advocate Satish Maneshinde said, “We are overwhelmed by the order of the SC.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rhea-fir-no-sc-relief-for-rajputs-sister/articleshow/81715963.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Literary world mourns passing of multi-faceted Anil Dharker||Well-known journalist, editor and founder of Mumbai’s Tata Literature Live festival Anil Dharker died on Friday. He was suffering from cardiac problems, a former colleague said. Dharker, who was in his seventies, was part of the city’s cultural life for five decades. He had served as editor of publications including The Illustrated Weekly of India, the Independent and Mid-day, and also headed the National Film Development Corporation, when it co-produced Richard Attenborough’s iconic film, Gandhi. “I may sound pompous when I say I’m multi-faceted, but I have worn many caps,” Dharker said on his website. “The list is pretty long. I have headed a TV channel, written scripts for audio-visuals, I have also written books. Basically, I do a lot of different things.”Colleagues shared warm memories of Dharker in his avatar as editor, describing him as, “an unfailingly kind man” and “a freethinker and fiercely democratic.” Journalist Vir Sanghvi, who wrote his first column for Dharker, tweeted, “He epitomised the caring and socially concerned Mumbai intellectual.”Always seen in elegant churidar-kurtas at work, Dharker graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering from the University of London. He was offered an academic position at the University of Glasgow but returned to India to join an architectural firm. He later moved to journalism. He was also a film and TV critic and helped open the Akashwani auditorium as an art movie theatre. His columns appeared in leading publications in India and abroad. “Perhaps his most important decision in life was when he chose to come back to India,” said close friend and columnist Shobhaa De. “He was passionate and proud of his country. And in later years, anguished and upset about the shrinking spaces for liberals like him...he used every platform available to him to make his views known.”De added: “As the dynamic and tireless founder of the Mumbai International Literature Festival, he nurtured diverse talents and provided an unbiased platform for people with opposing political beliefs, to be heard in the best spirit of democracy. I consider this his biggest achievement. To call him merely multi-talented does no justice to the vastness of his multiple passions—books, cinema, food, art. A truly remarkable Mumbaikar has left his home city much poorer by his sudden passing.”Dharker was someone who did a lot for literature and the intellectual community, said Khushroo Suntook, chairman of the NCPA, which used to co-host Tata LitLive. “We will miss him. We hope we can perpetuate his memory in some way.” “Anil has always been a source of support—an erudite mind—who has always understood the others’ point of view! Will miss him immensely,” said Sangita Jindal, chairperson, JSW Foundation.A sports buff, Dharker was an avid tennis player. The pandemic forced his last public event, the Tata Literature Live, to be held indoors on a virtual platform in November 2020. Dharker is survived by his daughter, actress Ayesha Dharker. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-literary-world-mourns-passing-of-multi-faceted-anil-dharker/articleshow/81715024.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

---||Madurai||Poll manifestos lack focus on seniors||Chennai: According to the Election Commission of India stats, more than 12.91 lakh electors on the electoral rolls across Tamil Nadu are above 80 years. “This is just the population of those over 80. There are more than 11 lakh senior citizens in the state, more than 5 lakh in Chennai alone,” says V Sivakumar, director, HelpAgeIndia TN.Still, while arrangements have been made this year for those seniors to vote from home, we still haven’t seen any focus on the needs of elders in the manifestos, he adds. Several weeks ago, the organisation sent out a list of demands to various political parties of what seniors in the state lack.“They think we are a microscopic section of the voting population. They couldn’t be more wrong as we are 11% of the population (according to the 2011 Census) and growing. And now with the postal ballot being allowed, more will cast their vote,” says D Rajasekaran, president of the Federation of TN Senior Citizens.According to Rajasekaran, more than 70% of the elders are below poverty line and don’t get covered by the government’s pension scheme. Sivakumar says the maintenance and welfare of parents and senior citizens Act of 2007 mandates the establishment of an old age home in every district that can accommodate at least 150 people, but it is not followed. . He added that pensions, healthcare, and security are all part of their list of demands. V Chandrasekhar of the Senior Citizens Group of Besant Nagar believes that healthcare and security are two of the primary needs of elders that is ignored by the government. “Recently, I was in an emergency situation and used the police SOS app Kavalan. The police showed up after an hour and then told me I had to go to the nearest police station as only the inspector can take action. Is this how a senior citizen in distress is handled,” says the 71-year-old.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/poll-manifestos-lack-focus-on-seniors/articleshow/81715011.cms||---

During a raid at the house of Baljinder Singh Bunty of Khanna, who is said to be the kingpin of this racket, Rs 44.6 lakh cash was recovered along with 50 cheques of undisclosed amount. During initial investigations, it emerged that Bunty operated 19 firms, through which he committed a huge fraud with the exchequer. Bunty was sent in judicial custody till April 9, after he was produced in court on Friday by the department. Ashutosh Baranwal, principal commissioner, CGST, Ludhiana, said, “We have busted another fake invoices and input tax credit (ITC) ring that was being controlled and operated by Baljinder Singh Bunty of Khanna through a network of 19 firms, all based in Punjab. The value of fraudulently availed ITC in these 19 firms is Rs 48 crore and the fake ITC passed is about Rs 40 crore, which was channelled through Rs 484-crore bogus billing. Bunty was arrested on March 25 and he was produced before the judicial magistrate on Friday.” Baranwal added, “When the search was conducted at the residential premises of Bunty in Khanna on March 24, he climbed the rooftop and threw a bundle of cheques, wrapped in a waterproof sheet, into agricultural fields behind his house. However, CCTV installed on his premises captured his attempt at destruction of evidence. During the search, Rs 44.6 lakh cash, which prima facie appears to be proceeds from the racket, was seized along with incriminating documents and digital devices. One Vishal Singh was also arrested on March 25. He is the proprietor in M/s Shri Giriraj Trading Co, which is one of the 19 firms involved in this racket. Along with Bunty, he availed fake ITC of Rs 2.5 crore and issued bogus invoices of Rs 21.89 crore through his firm.” According to the department, Bunty, in his statement on March 24 and March 25, admitted that he, along with others, had indulged in availing and passing of fraudulent ITC on fake invoices without any movement of goods. Vishal Singh admitted that he maintained accounts of other firms involved in this racket.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/two-businessmen-held-for-rs-484cr-bogus-billing/articleshow/81713287.cms||Mohit Behl

His daughter Archana Das was at the hospital on Thursday night, hours before the fire broke out. “When I was at the hospital, the fire alarm rang at least 3-4 times. But it was simply switched off and no action was taken. My father was in the ICU and the hospital did not inform us about any details. They would only call us for payment and not to inform us about the patient’s health or status. He was taken to M T Agarwal Hospital where he told the doctors his name, address and details of family members. He collapsed within a few minutes though. It looks like the hospital did not take any care to save his life,” said Archana. “He was going to be discharged. He was admitted for post-Covid treatment. He was infected last month and had turned negative and was discharged from a hospital in Thane but because he had problems, he was admitted to Sunrise Hospital. When we heard news of the fire in the hospital, we rushed there but they had no information about where he had been taken. We first rushed to the Mulund jumbo Covid centre, then Fortis Hospital and then to M T Agarwal where they told us that my father was dead,” Archana says. Govindlal was an employee with a public sector enterprise and had retired. “We had to take his body to Rajawadi Hospital on our own for an autopsy. ”tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-fire-alarm-rang-3-4-times-but-was-put-off/articleshow/81713284.cms||---

The civic body also requested postponing final year MBBS exams by two to three months to retain medical interns on Covid duties. The requests were made during the video conference of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray with all district and municipal authorities on Friday. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B said, “The manpower crunch was one of the reasons leading to shortage of beds in the city. We requested the government to send back doctors now deputed at Jalgaon. We also requested the state to postpone the exam of medical interns so that we get more manpower for Covid work.” The civic chief said infrastructure was not an issue, but manpower is causing the ongoing crisis. Regarding worsening state of affair in city, he said as cases are rising, it is a fact that now you can’t chose a hospital. “We asked hospitals to effectively follow discharge protocol and step down process. By this we will be able to generate additional beds. We are also trying to augment beds with 50 to 60 more private hospitals. We are trying to augment oxygen supply as well,” he said, adding that citizens must call up the NMC helpline to find beds. He added that NREGA commissioner Shantanu Goyal will be looking after AIIMS, tribal commissioner Manisha Khatri at GMCH, and MD of mining corporation Pradeep Chandran at IGGMCH. “They will ensure smooth management of beds, manpower and hospital related issues. They will look after administration,” he said. Radhakrishnan said work for setting up additional 200 beds at AIIMS is under way. “They must be able to start them in next couple of weeks. We are also starting oxygen beds at Pachpaoli CCC, which is a testing centre also,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-seeks-recall-of-doctors-from-jalgaon-ias-officers-to-administer-medical-colleges/articleshow/81713312.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Ahead of celebrations, city markets are flooded with ‘Made in India’ fancy water guns and sprinklers of different shapes and sizes. According to shopkeepers, coronavirus outbreak hampered trade with China which in turn affected the import of water guns and other items sold during Holi. This has helped Indian goods to take over the market. However, due to spike in Covid-19 cases, shopkeepers and traders feel they might not be able to clock decent sale this year. People are preferring traditional and simple ‘pichkaris’. Besides, pressure guns, a variety of tanks in the form of cartoons and faces of politicians, and gulal bombs are available in the price range of Rs 150 to Rs 3,000. Some people are also preferring silver pichkaris which are available at Saraffa market at much higher price of Rs 5,000. “We used to get designer waterguns from China which was a hit among customers. Now, we have simple pichkaris from Indian traders. Due to Covid, rates are comparatively high and sales are also down,” said president of Lucknow Vyapar Mandal Pawan Manocha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/made-in-india-pichkaris-rule-city-markets/articleshow/81715028.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Delhi||Covid-19 may cause relapse of rare blood disorder in kids||NEW DELHI: Can Covid-19 trigger a recurrence of the Kawasaki disease in children who are predisposed to the condition? This possibility has been raised by paediatricians from Holy Family and Fortis Escorts Institute (FEHI), who recently came across the case of a 10-year-old boy suffering from the viral infection. The child had developed Kawasaki disease at the age of four years, the doctors stated in a case report published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ). Kawasaki disease is a condition in which there is swelling and redness in blood vessels throughout the body. It mostly affects children younger than five years old. The 10-year-old boy, too, had been diagnosed with Kawasaki disease and treated successfully. However, when he got Covid-19 recently, it led to symptoms such as fever, lesions on the skin and altered level of consciousness. “Investigations showed noticeably elevated inflammatory markers, and an echocardiography (ECHO) revealed dilated coronary arteries. SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were positive,” the BMJ report says. It adds that the patient responded dramatically to intravenous immunoglobulin and intravenous steroid. “It is possible that SARS-CoV-2 infection triggered the recurrence of Kawasaki disease in this child, who might have been genetically predisposed to the condition,” it adds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-19-may-cause-relapse-of-rare-blood-disorder-in-kids/articleshow/81715030.cms||---

However, with the third phase of vaccination drive just around the corner, vaccine recipients have expressed concern about overcrowding at centres. Those going for their second dose are hoping there will be separate facilities for those taking first and second shot of the vaccine, so as to maintain social distancing and avoid chaos at the vaccination sites. Hotelier Manoj Sethi, who contracted Covid-19 after the first dose, has been advised by doctors to take the second shot a month later. He said, “I’m not sceptical about taking the second jab but I’ll wait for the appropriate time as prescribed by medical professionals. The staff at centres should call vaccine recipients in a phase-wise manner and avoid commotion at all costs.” He added, “The vaccination drive should be opened for people of all age groups so that we’re protected against the virus as soon as possible.” Sangeeta Choudhari, a teacher, said, “I am not at all hesitant about taking the second jab of vaccine. My first dose went very well and so will the second one, and I’ll get it as soon as possible. The authorities should allot time slots to avoid crowding. They can also increase the number of centres in the city.” Self-employed worker Vinod Ganvir said he would take his wife along for her first vaccine shot when he goes for his second dose. “Officials should set up specific dates and time slots for recipients so that there is no crowding of people at the centres. The staff should take extra care to ensure all Covid norms are followed.” Ganesh Rao, a pharmacist, believes that the safety of people can be ensured and overcrowding can be avoided if more vaccination centers are opened up in the city. He said, “I am looking forward to taking my second dose of vaccine. Those who have taken the first dose need to wait for a period of 6-8 weeks before taking the second dose of the vaccine. Hence, I am waiting.” Sheela Thakare, a housewife, said, “I don’t have any hesitation in taking the second dose, I believe in Indian doctors and our team of scientists. I will take second dose after a gap of four weeks from the first one.” She added, “In order to control crowding, the facilities should give time slots for vaccinations with tokens. At the same time, citizens should also take their own responsibility by wearing masks properly and maintaining social distancing.” (With inputs from Anastasia Dias, Eshika Bhargava, Dev Sethia)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rising-covid-cases-cause-of-concern-for-vaccine-aspirants-too/articleshow/81713294.cms||---

---||Agra||After solving 31 cases in 6 years, supercop Moti takes a final bow, bow||BAREILLY: He joined the police force as constable and in a span of six years rose to become circle officer. With a nose for sniffing out crime, Moti Jaslia, a seven-year-old tracker dog, helped the Mainpuri and Budaun police solve at least 31 cases. Despite a failing health, he helped solve one last case at Ushait in Budaun. A formidable sleuth, Moti won heaps of accolades during his career, including a silver medal at the 63rd UP Police Dog squad meet in 2019 for his commendable work. But on Thursday, he lost the battle against a kidney ailment that had plagued him for some time and breathed his last in Bareilly’s Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI). In the evening, senior police officers, his colleagues, and well-wishers gathered to bid their CO a goodbye. Moti was given a guard of honour before his burial in the Budaun police line. “Moti is no more but will always live in my heart,” said his handler Satveer Singh. He came in contact with this German Shepherd when UP Police purchased a five-month-old pup in Hyderabad and sent him to train at the National Training Centre for Dogs (NTCD), BSF Academy, Tekanpur in Gwalior in 2014. Since then, the two were inseparable. In 2015, constable Moti was formally inducted into UP Police. He were deployed in Mainpuri district where he proved that he had the knack for cracking cases when human colleagues found themselves in a dead end, said Singh. In all, he solved 25 cases there. “Within a few months of joining, Moti solved a blind case within a few minutes. Police recovered a beheaded body of a girl. There was nothing to identify the body but Moti sniffed out the missing head which was dumped in a pond nearly 2 km away. Once the victim was identified, the case was cracked within a day,” said the handler. “Moti had a 100 per cent success rate in cases where the crime scene was not disturbed by onlookers,” added Singh. And, he was rewarded fro his success. Moti rapidly rose from constable to finally become CO, Singh added. In June 2020, the dog-handler duo was shifted to Budaun.

On Thursday, Raut had said that a few regional parties want a non-Congress leader to head the UPA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-some-people-preparing-for-upa-ii-says-raut/articleshow/81715033.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar

---||Nagpur||RFO suicide: Reddy wants review of his ‘biased’ transfer||Nagpur: At a time when social organizations, political parties and leaders have demanded action against Melghat Tiger Reserve (MTR) field director MS Reddy in range forest officer (RFO) Deepali Chavan’s suicide case, the senior officer has demanded a review of his “one-sided” transfer. Harisal RFO Chavan had shot herself with her service pistol in official quarters on March 25, fed up allegedly from constant torture and harassment by Gugamal deputy conservator (DyCF) Vinod Shivkumar. In a letter addressed to the government through the state PCCF (Head of Forestry Force) on Saturday, Reddy said that nowhere in the suicide note did the deceased RFO hold him responsible for her suicide. “In fact, she praised me for the support I offered her while working, and always encouraging her,” he said. Between April 11, 2019 and January 1, 2021, Chavan had applied for a total of 97 leaves, on eight occasions. But her 37 days of medical leave from March 19, 2020, till April 26, 2020, were rejected by Shivkumar. Her 11 days leave in November 2020 was also rejected as other RFOs in the division were on leave. However, Reddy said that on July 29, 2020, he had approved her leave on WhatsApp. There were no instructions from his office to stop her salary or allowances, he added. “I supported her transfer even though she was not eligible. I had also supported her in two atrocity cases against her by giving her special counsel. She trusted me and this has been acknowledged by her in the suicide note,” Reddy said. However, protests following Chavan’s suicide have grown with anger against Reddy for his inaction in the matter. “The DyCFs of Melghat are asking all the RFOs to give it in writing that Reddy has done good work in Melghat. If this is true then it is a really serious matter. Instead of taking action, the state government is protecting him,” alleged Chitra Wagh, state BJP vice-president. Reddy said, “Chavan had complained against Shivkumar orally and taking note of this, I had warned him to change his attitude. I did not receive any written complaints against the DyCF from employees.” Meanwhile, some women employees who came out in support of Reddy and called on Amravati MP Navneet Rana to tell her that he always supported the employees and appreciated good work, were reprimanded for rallying with him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rfo-suicide-reddy-wants-review-of-his-biased-transfer/articleshow/81727315.cms||---
---||Mumbai||UP chain snatcher who dodged cops for long arrested in Mumbai||MUMBAI: Chakanlal Sonkar thought he had a foolproof plan to make a quick buck. The 44-year-old Uttar Pradesh native would come down to Mumbai twice a year, stay at a nondescript lodge and leave his phone in the room before he set out to rob train passengers. After carrying out seven or eight chain-snatchings, he would head back to his hometown till he thought he’d thrown investigators off his scent. But his luck ran out last week when the GRP put pieces of the puzzle together and arrested him. On March 18, around 5.35 am, Janshatabdi Express had left Dadar station. When the train slowed down at Matunga station, Vimal Lokre, 65, seated at the window felt someone tug at her chain from outside. The train hadn’t halted but Lokre’s chain worth Rs 1.2 lakh was stolen. After she lodged a complaint with the Dadar GRP, investigators began looking through CCTV grabs. “Surveillance footage from Matunga station showed the chain-snatcher walking out. We checked footage from Dadar station and found the man captured on cameras there too. At one point, he had lowered his mask and we had clear shots of his face,” said an officer. Police dug into their files on history sheeters and came across some old photos that matched the suspect. “But he had not carried a phone along, so we couldn’t track his location,” said senior inspector Dnyaneshwar Katkar. “The only information we had was that he had stayed in lodges in Mumbai Central and Kamathipura during an earlier case.” Teams of policemen checked about 30 lodges in these areas. Plainclothed policemen also fanned out into bylanes and made discreet inquiries till someone spotted Sonkar leave a salon. Sleuths pounced on him and a search of his room at a lodge revealed Lokre’s stolen chain. An officer said Sonkar, who took to crime in 2008, has a record of 30 offences and has been jailed thrice so far. His wife and two children live in their hometown Gonda. He usually targeted long-distance trains headed to Konkan and Goa during the night.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/up-chain-snatcher-who-dodged-cops-for-long-arrested-in-mumbai/articleshow/81716034.cms||Nitasha Natu
---||Patna||Bihar: Girls on top in all streams as 78.04% pass Inter exam||PATNA: Girls topped all the three streams of Intermediate examination conducted by the Bihar School Examination Board. The results were declared on Friday. Of the 22 top-rank holders in science, commerce and arts, 13 are girls. Sugandha Kumari of SN Sinha College (Aurangabad) in commerce and Sonali Kumari of Smt Parmeshwari Devi Girl’s Higher Secondary School (Biharsharif) in science emerged the state toppers with 94.2%. Both scored 471 marks out of total 500. Madhu Bharti of R Lal College (Khagaria) shared the top position in arts stream with Kailash Kumar of Simultala Awasiya Vidyalaya (Jamui) by scoring 92.6% (463 out of 500) marks. State education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary released the results on the board’s website biharboardonline.bihar.gov.in and bsebbihar.com in the presence of principal secretary (education) Sanjay Kumar and BSEB chairman Anand Kishor. Overall 78.04% students passed the examination, which is 2.4% less than last year’s 80.44%. About 13.4 lakh students appeared for the examinations between February 1 and 13 and 10,45,950 of them succeeded, Kishor said. Total 3,61,597 students made it to the first division while 5,42,993 passed in second division and 1,41,352 in third division. Total 401 results were pending and 356 examinees had been expelled during the exams. Girls outsmarted boys in the overall pass percentage as well, with 80.57% clearing their exam as compared to 75.71% of the boys. Praising the girls’ performance, Choudhary said, “The state government has constantly working to promote girl education in Bihar. Recently, we have conducted a special campaign -- ‘Praveshotsava’ — to bring back students to schools through mass enrolment,” he said. “Most of the toppers are from rural areas, which means that the government’s efforts of creating awareness towards education is bearing fruit in rural Bihar,” the minister said and congratulated the meritorious students and encouraged other students to work hard. He also congratulated Kishor for conducting a fair and transparent exam. “It is a big achievement for the BSEB to announce the results in such a short span of time and ahead of all other state and central boards,” Choudhary said. Sanjay also praised the girl students and said the board conducted a fair and impartial exam for the third consecutive year and it becomes the first state in the country to release its board results. Kishor said the BSEB has set a new record by declaring the results in just 21 days from the date of commencement of evaluation of answer copies. “More than 71 lakh barcoded copies were evaluated by the teachers from March 5. In a bid to reduce the burden on students amid the Covid-19 pandemic, the board has also increased the number of questions, giving more options to students,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/girls-on-top-in-all-streams-as-78-04-pass-inter-exam/articleshow/81714165.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Delhi||Why patients due for elective surgery should cut the queue for Covid vaccine||NEW DELHI: Patients waiting for elective surgery should get Covid-19 vaccines ahead of the general population, an international team of researchers has said. This would help avoid thousands of post-operative deaths linked to the virus. The researchers — nearly 25,000 surgeons from across the globe — estimate that global prioritisation of pre-operative vaccination for elective patients could prevent an additional 58,687 Covid-19-related deaths in one year. Their assertion is based on analysis of data for 1,41,582 patients from across 1,667 hospitals in 116 countries, including India, Australia, Brazil, China, UAE, UK and USA. The results of the analysis have been published in the British Journal of Surgery incorporating the European Journal of Surgery. The surgeons point out that between 0.6% and 1.6% of patients contract Covid-19 infection after elective surgery. “Patients who contract the infection are four to eight times at risk of death in the 30 days following a surgery. For example, whereas patients aged 70 years and over undergoing cancer surgery would usually have a 2.8% mortality rate, this increases to 18.6% if they get Covid,” they add. “Preoperative vaccination could support a safe re-start of elective surgery by significantly reducing the risk of Covid-19 complications in patients and preventing tens of thousands of Covid-19-related post-operative deaths,” co-lead author Aneel Bhangu, from the University of Birmingham, said. According to Dr Shilpa Sharma, a paediatric surgeon who led the study at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi, the findings of the study are very important for the judicious and efficacious use of the vaccine and prevention of hospital-acquired Covid infection. “Being a paediatric surgeon who operates on newborns and little children, we have to take further appropriate measures as children have not yet been considered candidates for vaccination. This puts the onus on the parents to protect their children. We would like the mothers of children who need any surgical procedure to get vaccinated as they would be staying with their children in the hospital,” Sharma said. During the first wave of the pandemic, up to 70% of elective surgeries were postponed, resulting in an estimated 28 million procedures being delayed or cancelled. Whilst surgery volumes have started to recover in many countries, the researchers state that ongoing disruption is likely to continue throughout 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-patients-due-for-elective-surgery-should-cut-the-queue-for-covid-vax/articleshow/81715052.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

Amid the aroma of ‘gulaal’, fancy water sprinklers and ‘tesu’ flowers, residents of Lucknow will paint the town in myriad colours but with safety norms. Social distancing and dry colours will rule to make the festival safe and enjoyable at the same time. Mehek Verma, a resident of Mahanagar, said, “My friends and I had plans to meet for a grand Holi but since Covid is still around and we have exams in April, we have planned to greet each other and celebrate from our homes via a virtual Holi party. This way we will stay protected and also be a part of the festival,” she added. “We will only play with dry colours this time and not visit relatives. We have kept sanitizer and masks for those who come to meet us,” said Indiranagar resident Vineeta Verma. “Holika Dahan and Holi Milan happens every year in our locality park but this time, we will go only for a short duration and avoid hugging anybody or eating ‘gujhiya’ as we want to maintain distance,” said resident Vijay Kumar. Most residents advocate for small-scale celebration of Holika Dahan and Holi Milan in their localities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/virtual-parties-dry-gulal-to-add-colour-to-holi-amid-pandemic/articleshow/81715040.cms||Aditi Singh
---||Agra||Contract killers turn their gun on man who hired them to eliminate his rival||BAREILLY: Giving a murder contract to eliminate his rival proved too costly for a man as he himself was killed by the three "killers" in Nawabganj area of Uttar Pradesh's Bareilly district. The deceased was an accused in a dowry death case and wanted to allegedly get rid of the complainant. When the "killers" found the reason behind the rivalry, they opted to kill the person who gave them the murder contract. Police had recovered a man's body on March 19 and further investigation revealed the shocking truth. The cops have arrested two of the contract killers and they accepted to have received Rs 50,000 from the victim. The deceased man, identified as one Bholanath, went missing while returning home after appearing for a court date in Bareilly. His wife had lodged a 'murder FIR' against four persons of a family. The accused in the case had registered a dowry death case against Bholanath and his brother after the suspicious death of their daughter in 2016. Additional SP (rural) Raj Kumar Agarwal told TOI, “During investigation, we found that Bholanath was in constant touch with history-sheeters Budhsen, Raees Ahmad and Baandhuram and the last call on his phone was made to one of them." "Budhsen and Baandhuram were detained for questioning and they told us that they were hired by Bholanath to kill an individual. Since Bholanath had direct enmity with the other person, they didn’t kill him as there was a high risk that Bholanath would be arrested and he would disclose their names. When Bholanath pressured them to return the Rs 50,000, they decided to kill him, instead," Agarwal said. Raees is absconding at present, but he will be arrested soon, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/contract-killers-turn-their-gun-on-man-who-hired-them-to-eliminate-his-rival/articleshow/81713339.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Thiruvananthapuram||‘Smugglers misused official machinery’||Thiruvananthapuram: An analysis of the statements given by Swapna Suresh and Sarith P S, key accused in Thiruvnanthapuram gold smuggling case, before the enforcement directorate (ED) produced before the high court show how they were forewarned using intelligence bureau (IB) reports. This indicates the criminal activity by M Sivasankar, former principal secretary to chief minister, and how the government protocol machinery under the chief minister was used to facilitate the gold and currency smugglers. While reports from IB received at the the chief minister’s office stated that people in the UAE consulate were involved in smuggling, instead of taking corrective action the information was shared by Sivasankar to alert Swapna during one of his visits to her residence. Besides, the official delegation of chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan was itself used for smuggling foreign currency to the UAE. During Swapna’s interrogation by ED officials on December 15 last year, the officers had asked her how Sivasankar knew that the consignment seized by customs contained gold, as she had earlier stated to ED that Sivasankar had helped her to get the consignment released from customs. “In April 2020…he told me and Sarith that he came across an intelligence report mentioning the smuggling activities of persons of the UAE consulate, Trivandrum, and warned Sarith and me to be careful and anything caught would lead to Sivasankar and chief minister of Kerala,” she stated in her statement. Sarith’s statement corroborates Swapna’s statement, when he was asked whether Sivasankar had prior knowledge about gold smuggling through diplomatic channels. “During April 2020, on the second day after the death of Swapna’s father, Sivasankar sir came to her house at PTP Nagar. That day sir informed that there is an IB report stating that gold is being smuggled through consignments arriving to the UAE consulate, Thiruvananthapuram (sic),” he said. The leakage of IB secret reports right from the CM’s office to two accused is likely to attract action against Sivasankar under UAPA and the Official Secrets Act, legal experts said. With these statements before the court, chargesheeting of Sivasankar seems imperative in the NSA case. Even the chief minister’s official delegation to UAE was used to smuggle foreign currency, which is clear from Sarith’s statement. He said that after the chief minister’s delegation left for the UAE, he received a call from one Harikrishnan in the general administration department (protocol) office and was informed that the delegation had forgotten to carry a packet that was supposed to be taken along with it, and it had to be delivered to the delegation in the UAE. He further said that he went to the general administration department and collected the packet and when it was scanned using the scanner in the consulate, it contained currency notes along with some spices. He further said that the packet was handed over to Ahmed Al Doukhi, a diplomat in the consulate who was to leave for Dubai that day. As per FCRA regulations and UAPA, harbouring and facilitating anti-national activities, that too using high public offices, would amount to treason and related charges. Swapna further states that Sivasankar has secret shares in the state government-backed Coconics laptop project, which is why he wanted her to work in that project. The statements are part of the more than 500-page document submitted by ED deputy director P Radhakrishnan in the high court, praying for quashing the FIR registered by the state crime branch against ED officers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/smugglers-misused-official-machinery/articleshow/81713353.cms||KP Saikiran

Major parts of the city that were blocked by protesters included Gill Chowk, Shivpuri Chowk, Bharat Nagar Chowk, Sherpur Chowk, Transport Nagar, Gill Canal crossing and Dugri Canal crossing. Public transport remained non-operational and as the city-based transporters had already given support to the bandh call, they did not run their out-of-the-city services. People travelling to other cities too suffered due to traffic jams at highways and major intersections.Vaibhav Sehgal, a bicycle parts’ manufacturer, said, “It took me at least one hour more to reach my factory at Focal Point as several main crossings and roads were blocked. It was very difficult to find an alternative route as blockades were almost everywhere.”A garment manufacturer said, “I had sent my car and driver to Chandigarh airport to receive a client who was coming from another state. But it took almost four hours to reach the airport due to the protests as almost all the major roads leading to it were blocked.” Narinder Mittal, general secretary of Ludhiana Business Forums, said, “All major roads leading to industrial areas and entry and exit points of the city were blocked.

As per the complaint lodged by Dattatray Gayke, in August 2019 the suspect trio took him to Balapur and showed a plot claiming to be owned by them. The suspects, citing that the land prices in the area are going up, asked Gayke to immediately pay the money. Unable to arrange money, he transferred his house in Baijipura area to their names. City Chowk inspector Sambhaji Pawar said, “The most surprising part of this case is that the physically non-existent plot does exist on some of the revenue records including 7/12 extract of that particular gat.” Gayke fell in the trap by cross-checking the 7/12 extract and purchased the land. It was only in October last year, when he went there to mark the plot, some olocals objected to it claiming that the land belonged to them. Upon verifying their documents, he found that the piece of land is registered in the name of a society. He approached the suspects asking them to either return his money or get him another non-disputed plot. After the suspects failed to keep their promise of resolving the issue, he reached out to the police and lodged a complaint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/3-booked-for-selling-land-using-forged-documents/articleshow/81715031.cms||---

One should never miss voting,” the retired banker said, looking eager to cast his vote at home like 1.59 lakh elderly people who chose postal ballots elsewhere in the state. No representative from any political party was present. A make-shift barricade was placed before the ballot box in the living room, while polling officials gave out declaration form 13A to Venkatramani to avail his signature. His identification was verified by voter ID, before being given a postal ballot that came in a pink envelope. The joy was palpable when Venkatraman turned to the ballot that bore the images and names of the candidates, along with their symbols. He chose his representative in private and came around to put the ballot in the box while the entire proceeding was being filmed by a videographer. Having covered 10 elders since morning, polling officer S Uthara and team left for Sundari’s residence close by. “I am so happy,” said the 88-year-old who had opted for postal ballot. Sundari and Venkatramani only had to forego indelible ink this time, which would be applied only at polling booths. Against the backdrop of criticism from opposition parties that the facility violates secrecy, the election commission announces postal ballot facility to 12.91 lakh voters aged 80 and above. Meanwhile, the service failed to reach many. V Shanmugam, 84, of Chairman Muthuramaiyer Road in Madurai South assembly segment said, “I was not approached by officials for the postal ballot. I would not have opted for it even if they had.” R S Lal Mohan, 84, of Water Tank Road in Nagercoil town, said, “It is a welcome move. But nobody has approached me so far.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/1-59-lakh-elders-opt-for-postal-ballots/articleshow/81715048.cms||Julie Mariappan

The court observed that there were no materials produced against the members of the search committee to prove any bias as alleged.The single judge had held that the committee was constituted in violation of the UGC Regulations and provisions of Tamil University Act which says that persons nominated should not be a member of any authority of the university. Hence, the judge had directed the state to reconstitute a fresh search committee in tune with the Act.Challenging the order, a batch of appeals were preferred including the one filed by Balasubramanian. Balasubramaniam contended that two members who were nominated to the search committee had past connections with the university and were not associated with the university at present.A division bench of justices M M Sundresh and S Ananthi observed that the words ‘shall not be connected with the university or college or recognised institution of the university’ cannot be stretched, by no imagination to mean that an ex-syndicate member and ex-VC would be disqualified from the member of the search committee.The judges observed that no materials were produced to prove bias against the members of the search committee nor do they find any legal malice is in existence. The judges observed that they do not find any likelihood of bias involved and Balasubramanian who was selected as VC is not known to any of the nominees, who formed part of the committee nor had any connection with the university.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-sets-aside-order-against-tamil-univ-vc-appointment/articleshow/81715049.cms||Kaushik Kannan

Based on their input, many bureaucrats have already been shunted out of the district and Trichy. Nine war rooms, where the DMK’s legal wing lawyers work in shifts, were set up in the district alone to receive complaints from the party cadres about the ruling party’s money distribution to voters and other violations of poll code. M Siva Suresh, organizer, Coimbatore North district DMK legal wing, said the Election Commission of India (ECI) had transferred district collector K Rajamani based on their complaints. Pointing out that the ruling party members had assaulted a cop at Iruttupallam area for removing the party’s wall posters, he said police hadn’t taken any action in connection with the incident. “We have taken up the issue with the election commission.” He said earlier the party had only one war room, which was functioning from Chennai. “Now, all the districts have war rooms to fight against the bureaucrats who support the ruling party.” tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/dmk-keeps-bureaucrats-under-war-room-scanner/articleshow/81714158.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Bhopal||Thrust on masks, but social distancing still a distant dream||Bhopal: “Do Guj Doori, Mask Hai Jaroori” (Maintain a distance of six feet and wear masks) is the message being sent across to people through media, outdoor publicity and even telephones and mobiles ever since Covid-19 pandemic broke out in the country. While, there has been a prolonged campaign (which is still continuing) to enforce the rule of “mandatory mask”, the social distancing norm could not be put into practice. The figures of penalty imposed on persons for not wearing masks are released from time to time (BMC is doing it daily, currently) but the number of persons fined for breaching the social distancing norms, is rarely given, because enforcement of social distancing norm has never been the focus of the agencies concerned. Though fine decided for both by the district collector in his latest order is Rs 500. It was only during lockdown period, when shops for essentials were allowed to open that the food safety department personnel used to check whether social distancing norms were being followed in grocery shops, superstores or not. “ When grocery shops were allowed to open during the lockdown, food safety department was assigned the task to enforce the distancing norms and also got circles drawn in shops so that people stood at safe distance from one another while shopping. The shopkeepers were also asked to insulate the shop through a rope and draw circles outside for customers to wait for their turn to get their order”, said an official of the food safety department, requesting anonymity. He, however, said that after the lockdown was lifted and things started normalising, neither the shopkeepers nor the law enforcing agencies bothered if the circles were in place and social distancing norm was duly followed. “The circles have now become extinct and ropes have been taken off the counters. It’s the same thoroughfare in shops as before”, he said. In the showrooms and superstores, masks are checked and at some places, thermal screening is also done but once a customer is in, nobody cares to ensure that he doesn’t run into crowd of customers. Even when a team of health workers started taking samples for Covid-19 testing at New Market of those not wearing a mask to enforce “compulsory mask” rule, social distancing was out of focus. “It has been a challenge to enforce social distancing in markets. We in the wholesale market had enforced “Mask nahin, saamaan nahin” (No mask, no goods) rule but in the evening, there is so much of crowd in old city markets that social distancing becomes impossible. “There is a need to restrict crowds in the market to ensure compliance to Covid-19 protocol”, said Anupam Agrawal, general secretary of Bhopal Kirana Mahasangh. The district administration has, however, maintained that it’s the responsibility of the shopkeepers not only to wear mask himself but also ensure that his customers also come in masks. He can refuse to give them goods if they don’t follow this, something which majority of traders find unreasonable. “How do you expect a shopkeeper to refuse giving goods to a person who is not wearing a mask. He will buy it from somewhere else. What the administration is asking us to do is unrealistic”, said Vikram Ahuja, a shopkeeper at Chuna Bhatti. However, after the chief minister launched the mass awareness campaign on Covid-19 protocol and himself drew circles outside some shops at Bhawani Chowk to prevail upon the traders to ensure social distancing and district administration also swung into action at public places particularly markets, white circles have slowly started appearing outside the shops and ropes are again out to cover the counters to restrict entry of people into the shop.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/thrust-on-masks-but-social-distancing-still-a-distant-dream/articleshow/81713368.cms||---
---||Goa||Now, CM says Rane will issue new Covid SOPs||Porvorim: Chief minister Pramod Sawant said on Friday that he would ask health minister Vishwajit Rane to issue a new standard operating procedure (SOP) for Covid-19 in the state. The CM’s statement came on the floor of the House after MLAs raised concerns over the spread of the disease. Sawant said the new SOP would be “implemented strictly”. Rane, meawhile, said that the government would shift the 30-odd casino staffers who tested positive to the South Goa district the hospital immediately, and denotify the micro-containment zone at a housing complex in Porvorim after people from the area became apprehensive. Rane also said that casino operators would be asked to conduct Covid-19 tests on all staffers. “SOPs on preventive measures to contain the spread of Covid-19 in the state, imposing restrictions on movement, and other (measures) are being examined by the government,” Rane said. The opposition demanded that the government declares the offshore casino on the Mandovi a micro-containment zone. Porvorim MLA Rohan Khaunte said that till date, the government has not declared the casino as a micro-containment zone. He said that the casino staffers should have been shifted to the Covid centre. Khaunte also said that nightlife is continuing in the state as usual. “Where is the use of face masks and social distancing? The CM should assure the House that he will shut casinos,” Khaunte said. “There is fear and anxiety in the minds of the people due to the absence of Covid protocols in the state,” Khaunte said in his calling attention motion. “Goa was among the first few states in the country to be declared Covid-free, but due to the lack of restrictions on outsiders entering the state, despite foresight of its repercussions, Goa was stripped of its ‘green zone’ title.” Khaunte said that once again, on the arrival of the second wave, the state government stands unguarded welcoming outsiders. “Our neighboring states like Maharashtra have imposed strict Covid-testing protocols on arrival, to prohibit all possible suspects from entering the state,” he said. “The (Goa) government needs to take similar steps at this preliminary stage to prevent community transmission of the virus.” Khaunte also said that while Covid is fast spreading in the state, the government is permitting exhibitions. Replying to the motion, Rane said that Goa is a tourist destination, and that the government needs to manage Covid as well as ensure no panic in the minds of the people. “The flexibility of testing and other measures we’re providing are as per the video-conference held with the PM,” said Rane. “It was very clearly mentioned to take precautions but not to unnecessarily create panic.” Speaking on the issue of asking for a Covid-negative certificate from those entering Goa, Rane said that he also suggested the same. “A Covid-19 negative certificate can be also purchased, and I want to bring it to the notice of MLAs that we are doing everything possible,” Rane said. “At the same time, we have to co-exist with business. There is no 100% guarantee that with a Covid-negative certificate, a person will be Covid-free.” Khaunte said that the death of over 800 people due to Covid is also a big number. Meanwhile, Poriem MLA Pratapsingh Rane said that the government should strictly enforce mask-use in the state. Fatorda MLA Vijai Sardesai said that asking for a Covid-19 negative certificate is not to stop tourism, but that there should be a balance between life and livelihood.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/now-cm-says-rane-will-issue-new-covid-sops/articleshow/81715144.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||30% eateries shut shop in lockdown in Ahmedabad||AHMEDABAD: With dreams of success in his eyes, Parth Patel opened a restaurant on Hebatpur Road. Today, with a heavy heart, he made the decision to shut shop. He is not alone. At least 30 per cent of restaurants and eateries in Ahmedabad have been forced to down shutters due to the Covid pandemic and the ever-changing safety and curfew rules of the state government. Food entrepreneurs say most of them are battling losses despite re-opening shops in June. The constantly-changing Covid-19 guidelines of the state government have made things worse for their businesses. “Piling costs of operations with no revenue, shortage of staff due to the exodus of workers, and the changes in curfew timings hurt sales. It made doing business unviable. My partners and I thus decided to shut shop,” said Parth. Estimates from the Food Entrepreneurs’ Alliance (Gujarat) show that at least 30 per cent of food joints in the city have shut shop since the pandemic hit. Rajesh Patel, who owns a theme-based restaurant at Jivraj Park, got a relative to handle his new outlet on Sindhu Bhavan Road. “We shelved the plan to expand our restaurant. Our revenue was badly affected. So, the SBR outlet is now managed by my relative as it was not viable for us to run two outlets simultaneously,” said Patel. Miti Thakkar, a restaurant owner and interior designer, said, “I was about to launch my second restaurant in Ahmedabad in March last year. Thanks to the pandemic, the launch didn’t happen in March. Even after the lockdown was lifted, I waited for three months hoping things would get back on track after the restaurant started. However, the industry situation was not favourable for family restaurants anymore. There was no relaxtion in rent from the property owners. The curfew timings were odd and civic authorities often asked us to shut down on random days even if there was no violation of the rules.” Besides newer players, several established restaurateurs were also forced to shut outlets. “We shut one of our restaurants at YMCA Club. Sales have fallen massively since the pandemic began and meeting operating costs is a challenge,” said Rushad Jinwala, a restaurateur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/30-eateries-shut-shop-in-lockdown/articleshow/81714163.cms||Niyati Parikh

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Isaac: I-T officers resorted to ‘hooliganism’ at KIIFB||Thiruvananthapuram: Continuing his tirade against the marathon raid by Income Tax (I-T) department at KIIFB office even past Thursday midnight, finance minister T M Thomas Isaac here on Friday said the I-T officials engaged in ‘hooliganism’ at the KIIFB office. Addressing a news conference here on Friday, Isaac reiterated that the central agencies were making deliberate, political moves to unsettle and defame KIIFB. “Let them say what exactly they are looking for. KIIFB has a mechanism according to which income tax on funds paid to contractors are not directly paid by it. Instead, the tax on funds are credited in the account of special purpose vehicles such as road fund board or Inkel, while the funds due to the contractors are credited directly in the accounts of contractors. KIIFB has given Rs 73 crore as income tax component to SPVs and they have already paid the same to I-T, without fail. All these have been clarified to I-T and if they are still doubtful of its authenticity, they should go to SPVs and cross check. They need not to come to KIIFB for such things,” said Isaac. Isaac said KIIFB was ready to share with I-T officials the password of its fund management system, using which I-T can inspect KIIFB accounts sitting in their own office. “This is sheer villainy on the part of I-T officials. Whom did these junior officials question? It was none other than (KIIFB CEO) K M Abraham. If the income tax commissioner Manjit Singh doesn’t know who Abraham is, he should go and study the Sahara case. Despite efforts by persons as mighty as former Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, nobody could touch Abraham for his stand in the Sahara case,” Isaac said, adding that the officials engaged in the I-T raid should apologize for what they did at KIIFB. Isaac said he was expecting ED to raid KIIFB before next Easter in connection with black money allegations. KIIFB clarifies KIIFB issued a statement on Friday saying that the fund board would submit in a couple of days the additional information sought by I-T. “The inspection, which started by 12 noon lasted till 12 midnight. KIIFB CEO and fund managers were thoroughly questioned. The questioning of KIIFB CEO was taken over by the income tax commissioner Manjit Singh by 9:30pm and it lasted till 11:30 pm. The inspection was in connection with the TDS deduction from the funds given to contractors. Wrong interpretation of I-T Act and misconception about the procedures followed by KIIFB are the basis of the inspection, the statement said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/isaac-i-t-officers-resorted-to-hooliganism-at-kiifb/articleshow/81713374.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Mall didn’t have NOC, but hospital inside got it||MUMBAI: The blaze which led to the deaths of nine patients at Sunrise Hospital in Bhandup’s Dreams Mall may have spread from the first floor of the mall, said a fire brigade official. Fire-fighting operations went on the entire night. “The fire-fighting system in the mall and hospital were non-functional which affected our operations,” he said, requesting anonymity. Incidentally, the basement, first and second floors of Dreams Mall had failed to get an ‘all clear’ from the fire department. However, the hospital housed inside it applied for and promptly got an ‘NOC’ from the very same department. “The fact that there were not enough ducts to let the smoke out after the fire started shows that the go-ahead was given without a rigorous fire safety audit,” said an official. In all, 78 patients were brought down with ladders and lifts or led out by firemen using the mall’s staircases. Those who succumbed were declared dead on reaching other hospitals. Asphyxia was cited as the reason. In all, 16 fire engines, 15 jumbo tankers, 3 regular water tankers, 2 aerial ladder platforms, 1 turn table ladder, 3 breathing apparatus vans were used. A fire hydrant near the site was also activated. An official said they would soon serve a notice to the mall and hospital under Section 6 of the Maharashtra Fire Prevention and Life Safety Measures Act 2006, which says it is the owner’s or occupier’s liability to provide fire and life safety measures. Ramesh Pawar, BMC joint commissioner (fire brigade), said, “A fire investigation has been initiated and depending on the outcome, action will be initiated against the mall or hospital, wherever lapses are found.” While the hospital is on the third floor of the mall, the second floor has a banquet hall and the first floor has shops for home décor and imitation jewelry. Mahesh Dawda, a manager at a store, said he learnt about the blaze post-midnight. "When I reached the site, fire fighting operations were underway and no one was being allowed inside.” Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray who visited the spot announced Rs 5 lakh compensation to kin of each of the deceased. He was accompanied by BMC chief Iqbal Singh Chahal and mayor Kishori Pednekar. Ex-CM Devendra Fadnavis and BJP MP Manoj Kotak also visited the site. Thackeray said the state gave temporary permission to some hospitals to boost infrastructure to treat Covid-19 patients; permission given to the Bhandup hospital was to end on March 31, he said. He directed officials to do an audit of hospitals inside structures like malls or buildings. Municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal has ordered a probe into the fire incident and asked deputy municipal commissioner (Disaster Management) Prabhat Rahangdale to submit a report within 15 days. The probe will determine the exact cause of the fire in consultation with the chief fire officer and also fix responsibility on the officials concerned regarding illegality in the structure. Sunrise Hospital denied the casualties were caused by the fire. Nine of the victims were on ventilator and highly dependent on life-support systems, which became a key factor in the failure to evacuate them, the hospital’s chief medical officer told TOI. The other two, Ambaji Patil (65) and his wife Sunandabai Patil (58), had died before the fire . The hospital in a statement said all patients were “promptly shifted” to a jumbo Covid centre and private hospitals. “The patients were shifted alive,” it said. “We held the hand of patients who could walk and guided them through the stairs. We moved sicker patients to the cafeteria space that leads to an open terrace so that they could be rescued using hydraulic ladder,” said the doctor, adding the ICU had 21 patients of which 8-9 were on non-invasive ventilator. “Many were not just attached to ventilators but also multiple tubes for BP medications, inotropes (used in management of heart contractions), etc. Without ventilator support, they wouldn’t have survived for more than 10-15 minutes. We started evacuating the more stable patients who could maintain oxygen for a while, thinking we will come back later for those on ventilator,” the doctor said. “We believe the casualties have not occurred due to fire, but either in transit or at other hospitals. This hospital was started in exceptional circumstances… and has helped in saving many patients from Covid deaths. It is functioning with all due compliances like fire license, nursing home license, etc," said the hospital. Many questions remain on the hospital’s functioning and whether it had a separate entrance and exit for patients and personnel as mandated. The building, developed by Wadhawans of HDIL, is also believed to be a disputed property referred to NCLT, said a source. That being the case, allowing a new business to operate from a contested premise is questionable, said a source.

According to data, this is the highest in three months. The new cases are also 19% more than the previous day. “The rise calls for utmost precaution and care against the pandemic. Though the numbers are not increasing as rapidly as they are in some other Indian states, carelessness at this hour can fuel the rise,” said a senior health officer engaged in surveillance. Stating that the active cases have doubled in about four days, officials anticipated the problem assuming a much bigger shape over the next week. As per the official bulletin, the number of active cases as on Friday was 5,824 which speaks for an increment of 57% in one week. Additional chief secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad said that of the total active cases, 3,088 are under home isolation, while the remaining are hospitalised. He said that the rise in cases has led to a decline in the state’s recovery rate as well. “The recovery rate has come down from 98.25% to 97% now,” he said, adding that the total number of recovered reached 5,96,698 with 247 new additions in the past 24 hours. Experts warned against any carelessness as the risk of complications was looming large. “As many as 22 persons have died in the past one week, including six in the past 24 hours.

While some travellers have kept their date with their holiday destinations, many have apprehensions and are rethinking their decisions. Estimates from travel agents and tour operators suggest that inquiries for the Holi long weekend as well as the summer vacations have nosedived over the past one week. “Instead of 50-70 calls a day inquiring about domestic holidays, we get barely 10-12 booking inquiries. This is indicative of how sentiment has died down. People go on a trips to be able to relax and enjoy themselves. “However, restrictions such as the mandatory RT-PCR tests in Rajasthan and Maharashtra; the lockdown and curfews imposed in other parts of the country coupled with the extended night curfews and curbs on bus movement in major cities of Gujarat have brought back the fear factor,” said Manish Sharma, Gujarat chairman of the Travel Agents Federation of India (TAFI). Holiday-goers who have already booked trips haven’t had knee-jerk reactions to the developments of the past week. For instance, Ahmedabad-based professional, Debashree Das, who is to take a weeklong holiday with her family next week, said, “My itinerary is simple, and the situation is fairly under control at the destination I’m headed to. But yes, the uncertainty has made me a bit apprehensive and while I have not cancelled plans, I’m keeping tabs on the latest developments.” Inquiries were good for Goa, Kashmir, Shimla, Kullu Manali and even the North East. However, most plans have now been put on hold. Virendra Shah, chairman of the Gujarat chapter of the Travel Agents’Association of India (TAAI), said, “Inquiries which were about to materialize are now on hold. Many clients were on the verge of making final payments but have indefinitely deferred plans. “Those who are travelling are double-checking Covid-19 safety rules at hotels and most tend to ask for bookings at branded hotels.” TAAI estimates suggest that bookings for summer holidays this year are barely a quarter of the domestic business that took place before the pandemic hit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/curfew-restrictions-cause-holiday-bookings-to-nosedive/articleshow/81714211.cms||---

Though sources in the AIADMK’s IT wing called it fake and that they would be issuing a press release in this regard, it was not released till late in the night.The so-called letter on the party letterhead had a signature purportedly of the minister. It was stated that he was writing it with the intention that Amma’s rule will be established in the state again. “I understand that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other national leaders of the BJP will be coming to Tamil Nadu to campaign for the elections. However, the situation is such that their presence could affect the victory prospects of AIADMK. The people of Tamil Nadu seem to resent the BJP and the leaders’ visit to the state could impact the trust that people of the state have on the AIADMK,” it said while asking the CM to tell the national leaders not to come for the campaign.

In light of MHA order and in view of upcoming festivals such as Holi, Shab-e-Baraat, Bihu, Easter and Eid-ul-Fitr among others it is strongly advised that state governments may consider imposing local restrictions in public observation of these festivals and limit/do away with mass gatherings and exercise of powers conferred under Section 22 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, Ahuja stated.Ensuring strict adherence to various SoPs issued by MoHFW to contain the spread of Covid-19, may result in losing the impetus and benefits that our country has gained so far in managing the virus. Measures like strict adherence to Covid norms, appropriate behaviour in public places and ban on gatherings are vital to break the chain of transmission and reduce the incidence of cases in the country, she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/nhm-calls-for-effective-control-of-covid-ahead-of-festivals/articleshow/81713379.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

On Thursday, the city had recorded 1,515 new cases in the last 24 hours. Wednesday had seen 1,254 new patients and 1,101 cases had been recorded on Tuesday — the first time since December 24 that the number of daily cases crossed the 1,000-mark. Friday’s 1,534 cases took the total tally to 6,54,276, while the death toll touched 10,987 with nine fresh fatalities recorded in the last 24 hours. The active cases rose to 6051 from 5,497 on Thursday. The positivity rate rose to 1.8% from 1.6% on Thursday. The positivity rate was 1.5% Wednesday, 1.3% on Tuesday, 1.3% percent on Monday and 1% on Sunday. The number of people under home isolation has risen to 2,560. The containment zones rose to 1,307 from 1,076 on Thursday, officials said. The caseload in Delhi on January 1 had stood at over 6.25 lakh and the total fatalities were 10,557. The number of daily cases had started to come down in February. On February 26, the month’s highest daily count of 256 cases was recorded. However, the number of daily cases begun to rise again in March and has been steadily increasing over the last few days. Demand for hospital beds has also gone up with the increase in cases. Data shared on the Delhi Corona app shows 1,244 (22%) beds out of 5742 Covid-19 ones were occupied across the city. The occupancy of Covid-19 ICU beds with and without ventilator support was 27% percent and 25%, respectively. Health experts and doctors have attributed this “sudden rise” in cases to people turning complacent, not following Covid-appropriate behaviour and “assuming all is well now”. The next two-three months could be challenging, they said, adding the situation can be kept under control if vaccination is opened up for more people and Covid-19 protocols are strictly adhered to. Amid a rise in coronavirus cases, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority had on Tuesday ordered that there will be no public celebrations in the national capital during upcoming festivals such as Holi and Navaratri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/daily-tally-stays-above-1500-as-active-cases-in-city-cross-6000/articleshow/81715098.cms||---
---||Mumbai||CGST superintendent, 3 others held for Rs 12L bribe in Mumbai||Mumbai: CBI has arrested a Central Goods and Services Tax (CGST) superintendent Amit Dalal, two chartered accountants, and one of their employees for accepting a Rs 12 lakh bribe. The agency also recovered Rs 30 lakh during searches on their premises. Dalal’s superior, an assistant commissioner (GST), is under the scanner. Dalal had allegedly demanded Rs 15 lakh from a jeweller — the complainant — for not enhancing his GST evasion/tax liability and not arresting him. After the complaint, CBI laid a trap and arrested CAs Gopal Bhatter, Ramesh Parmar and Gopal’s employee Hemant Motivaras on Thursday. When they tried to reach Dalal, he sniffed trouble. He fled from his office in the Air India building on Marine Drive and left the city for Delhi. But a CBI team was waiting at his home there and arrested him on Friday. He was produced before a special CBI court in Mumbai, which remanded him in police custody till March 28. Dalal and his team had raided the jeweller at Kalbadevi for alleged tax evasion on February 4. The complainant claimed they forced him to confess to evading Rs 2.5 crore GST and sign post-dated cheques of Rs 2.3 crore penalty. Dalal demanded Rs 15 lakh after threatening to increase the evasion amount to Rs 5 crore and arresting him. He added that he had to share the spoils with the assistant commissioner, who can give more time for clearance of the jeweller’s post-dated cheques. Dalal kept threatening the jeweller — last month in his office and recently at Wadala — to pay up. At this point, the complainant approached CBI, which successfully laid a trap.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/cgst-superintendent-3-others-held-for-rs-12l-bribe-in-mumbai/articleshow/81716139.cms||Vijay V Singh

Due to efforts by his government, he said, the state has already started its march towards becoming $1 trillion economy and in the past four years, had become an example of not just ease of doing business but also ease of living. Yogi said this while virtually addressing the India Economic Conclave on Friday. Talking about the works done over the past four years, Yogi said that in 2015-16, UP’s economy was sixth in the country but currently it was at the second position. “UP has the largest MSME sector in the country, which generates the maximum employment with little investment. In 2018, we started the ‘one district-one product scheme’ and promoted handicrafts and industries of all 75 districts,” he said. The rate of unemployment in the state had shrunk from 17.5% in 2015-16 to 4.1% currently, the CM said, adding that the government’s schemes had helped to create several jobs in agriculture and MSME sectors. In the past four years, 4 lakh jobs had been generated in the government sector while investments had created another 35 lakh jobs. In the MSME sector, 1.5 crore jobs opened up, he said. This, he added, also resulted in per person income going up from Rs 47,000 in 2017 to Rs 95,000 currently. Despite 2020 being affected by the pandemic, the state saw private investments of Rs 3 lakh crore, the CM said, adding that out of this, Rs 60,000 crore came in just 2020. The government provided homes to 40 lakh poor families, power connections to 1.21 crore villages and 2.61 crore toilets. All border roads are being expanded into four lanes, all district headquarters are being linked with four-lane roads while five expressways are under construction. “In 2017, there were two airports in the state. At present, eight airports are functional and work is taking place in 17.

The product is available on e-commerce websites. Shantikumar Nair, dean (research) of the centre, said, “We have used a fibre with nanoengineered coating between the polypropylene sheets in the mask. The coating is so thin but could filter virus droplets and bacteria up to 99%. The mask’s breathability index is two.” Pointing out that they had been working on the mask ever since the outbreak of the pandemic, he said it took them some time to optimize the design, subject it to multiple tests and take a final decision on making it available for the public. “The masks could be made available at a cheaper rate, if an industry player produces it.” He said that the filtration capacity of the mask was tested by SITRA and the capacity was said to be more than 95%, which is higher than the N95 masks. Deepthy Menon, a professor, said, “This washable, durable and reusable mask ensures 99.9% bacterial and virus aerosol filtration.

The seven-day moving average of cases in MP is about 1500 cases, as of Friday. A repeat of trend witnessed in first week of September last year. Given the trajectory and likely spike in movement of people during the upcoming festive season, health experts are warning of a further spike in Covid-19 cases. “It took more than two months for active cases, resulting from September spike to curtail. Hospitalisation bed occupancy was at its peak in November and December. Covid-19 is linked to our social behaviour. We all need to absolutely avoid unnecessary travel and moving out,” said Dr Rajiv Singh. Seven day death rate average was 1.6 for Madhya Pradesh on March 1. It has increased to 4.9 as of Thursday. “In mid-September last year, the average seven day death rate was a high of 30. Vaccination and better treatment has reduced our death rate. However, the gains made from vaccination drive is being lost, if we do not adhere to social distancing and other measures to curb virus spread,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/mp-heads-towards-all-time-high-of-daily-covid-count/articleshow/81713413.cms||---

This is the highest number of cases recorded since November 16. Though 96 people got discharged, the number of active cases crossed the 1,000-mark to reach 1,013. No death due to the virus was recorded. Two clusters have been formed at Ganapathy and Kovilmedu. Of the 173 cases, 10 are from VKR Road at Ganapathy. “The 10 cases are spread across three houses, where two houses had four positives each and one house had two positive cases. We are sure the infection was not spread between the houses, because they are six kilometres apart,” said city health officer Dr S Raja. “They come under three different family clusters,” he added. A seven-member cluster at Kovilmedu reportedly have a travel history outside the district. “This is one family and thus not a cluster that requires to be investigated further for gene sequencing,” said deputy director of public health Dr G Ramesh Kumar. With the number of active cases tripling in 20 days, officials have begun works to create Covid care centres. “A centre at Gandhipuram and one at Bharathiar University with 413 beds are ready. However, we have not opened them because there is no demand,” said Raja. “Of the 936 active cases, more than 90% are in hospitals and the remaining are in home quarantine.” The number of people getting vaccinated has dropped from an average of 8,000 a day last week to 4,820 on Thursday due to vaccine shortage. On Thursday, even the GH ran out of Covaxin. Meanwhile, a teacher, who took the first shot of vaccine a month ago, has tested positive for the virus in Sulur, sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/173-fresh-covid-19-cases-in-dist-active-cases-cross-1000-mark/articleshow/81714238.cms||---

---||Lucknow||AAP’s door-to-door drive to build its brand in rural UP||LUCKNOW: With a little over two weeks to go for the first phase of the panchayat elections in UP, Aam Aadmi Party will use its tested formula of door-to-door campaigning to build its brand in rural parts of the state. Sources in the party also believe that AAP may have an advantage in establishing its name during this election with Samajwadi Party having declared that in seats where there is no consensus on any one candidate, it will allow all of them to contest. “We had declared our first list of candidates on the day the court struck down the state’s reservation policy. So now that will have to be changed. However, we will be strongly backing all our candidates, and MLAs and ministers from Delhi are being called to campaign for them. Our aim is to establish our presence in the state and will focus on door-to-door campaigns and small sabhas in all villages,” said AAP MP Sanjay Singh. Looking at an opportunity in SP’s poll tactic for this year to allow multiple candidates on some seats, another party member suggested that this could give AAP a platform to gain recognition. “People have heard of Arvind Kejriwal and refer to us as the ‘jhadu wali party’. We need to capitalise on this and ensure that they are able to link us with the development in Delhi. On the other hand, opposition parties are talking of fielding multiple candidates on some seats which, we believe, will only create confusion and this could work to our advantage, especially since people are also now aware that Sanjay Singh and AAP have played the role of the opposition to lead several protests against the UP government in this past year,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/aaps-door-to-door-drive-to-build-its-brand-in-rural-up/articleshow/81715113.cms||Neha Lalchandani

---||Goa||Sawant says health minister will issue new SOPs||PORVORIM: Chief minister Pramod Sawant said on Friday that he would ask health minister Vishwajit Rane to issue a new standard operating procedure (SOP) for Covid-19 in the state. The CM’s statement came on the floor of the House after MLAs raised concerns over the spread of the disease. He said the new SOP would be “implemented strictly”. Rane, meawhile, said that the government would shift the 30-odd casino staffers who tested positive to the South Goa district hospital immediately, and denotify the micro-containment zone at a housing complex in Porvorim after people from the area became apprehensive. Rane also said that casino operators would be asked to conduct Covid-19 tests on all staffers. “SOPs on preventive measures to contain the spread of Covid-19 in the state, imposing restrictions on movement, and other (measures) are being examined by the government,” Rane said. The opposition demanded that the government declares the offshore casino on the Mandovi a micro-containment zone. Porvorim MLA Rohan Khaunte said that till date, the government has not declared the casino as a micro-containment zone. He said that the casino staffers should have been shifted to the Covid centre. Khaunte also said that nightlife is continuing in the state as usual. “Where is the use of face masks and social distancing? The CM should assure the House that he will shut casinos,” Khaunte said. “There is fear and anxiety in the minds of the people due to the absence of Covid protocols in the state,” Khaunte said in his calling attention motion. “Goa was among the first few states in the country to be declared Covid-free, but due to the lack of restrictions on outsiders entering the state, despite foresight of its repercussions, Goa was stripped of its ‘green zone’ title.” Khaunte said that once again, on the arrival of the second wave, the state government stands unguarded welcoming outsiders. “Our neighboring states like Maharashtra have imposed strict Covid-testing protocols on arrival, to prohibit all possible suspects from entering the state,” he said. “The (Goa) government needs to take similar steps at this preliminary stage to prevent community transmission of the virus.” He further said that while Covid is fast spreading in the state, the government is permitting exhibitions. Replying to the motion, Rane said that Goa is a tourist destination, and that the government needs to manage Covid as well as ensure no panic in the minds of the people. “The flexibility of testing and other measures we’re providing are as per the video-conference held with the PM,” he said. “It was very clearly mentioned to take precautions but not to unnecessarily create panic.” Speaking on the issue of asking for a Covid-negative certificate from those entering Goa, Rane said that he also suggested the same. “A Covid-19 negative certificate can be also purchased, and I want to bring it to the notice of MLAs that we are doing everything possible,” Rane said, adding, “At the same time, we have to co-exist with business. There is no 100% guarantee that with a Covid-negative certificate, a person will be Covid-free.” Khaunte said that the death of over 800 people due to Covid is also a big number. Meanwhile, Poriem MLA Pratapsingh Rane said that the government should strictly enforce mask-use in the state. Fatorda MLA Vijai Sardesai said that asking for a Covid-19 negative certificate is not to stop tourism, but that there should be a balance between life and livelihood.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sawant-says-health-minister-will-issue-new-sops/articleshow/81715172.cms||---

---||Coimbatore||Murder convict lawyer commits suicide||Coimbatore: City-based lawyer E T Rajavelu, who was lodged in the Coimbatore Central Prison last November for murdering a client 10 years ago, committed suicide by hanging on Friday. Prison wardens said they never expected the 53-year-old man to take the extreme step. “On Friday afternoon, he spoke to some wardens as usual and said that one of them reminded him of his second son. He later went to his cell in the tower block and attempted to commit suicide by tying a towel around his neck and the cell door. However, some wardens noticed the attempt and rushed him to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH),” a senior prison officer said. Doctors declared Rajavelu dead around 2.30pm. The body was sent to the mortuary for autopsy. M Ammasai, 45, of Sivananda Colony in the city, had first met Rajavelu at his office in Gopalapuram on December 11, 2011, seeking legal remedy for a dispute with her husband. Rajavelu, who was trying to save his wife Manoharan Mohana, 47, in a Rs 12 crore cheating case filed by the Odisha police, strangled Ammasai to death with the help of his driver P Palnisamy. He took the body to his rented house at Sundarapuram and told his neighbours that it was the body of his wife, who died of cardiac arrest. He managed to get a doctor certify the death of Mohana and cremated Ammasai’s body at the Athupalam electric crematorium. He later obtained a death certificate from the Coimbatore corporation. The city police launched a search for Ammasai after her family lodged a missing complaint. In 2013, when Rajavelu attempted to register a property in Mohana’s name, someone sent a copy of the death certificate to the registration department. Rajavelu then approached the munsif court, claiming that someone had obtained the death certificate by mistake. When the city police began collecting details about them, Rajavelu and Mohana went absconding. Police caught them from Kovalam in Thiruvananthapuram on December 5, 2013 and lodged them in the Coimbatore jail. The Vth additional district judge court awarded double life term to Rajavelu and Mohana for murdering Ammasai on November 30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/murder-convict-lawyer-commits-suicide/articleshow/81714251.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Lucknow||UP: BJP focus on 84 ‘weak’ seats, targets all 403 in 2022 polls||LUCKNOW: Panchayat elections may have put the state BJP in an overdrive to strengthen its connect with rural voters but that does not mean the party has, even for a moment, deviated its focus from the state assembly elections due early next year, say party insiders. The party has already started its “homework” for seats where it sees itself in a weak position compared to the rest of the seats. There are close to 84 such seats spread over the entire state where the party will have to pull up its socks if it wants to do better than the previous assembly elections. Party insiders maintain that BJP does not only want to win the 2022 assembly elections but also aims to better its record of 2017. To achieve results, the party’s think tank has already got into the huddle, scanning in detail each of the 403 Vidhan Sabha seats based on the 2017 assembly election results. How each of these seats has performed in previous Lok Sabha elections has also been considered. In 2017, BJP won 325 seats with its alliance partners and 312 individually. “Poori 403 kyun nahin (Why not all 403), is what has baffled the party's strategists and we do not want to settle for anything less than all 403 seats this time," said a senior party leader. The insiders said at least 84 Vidhan Sabhas are what the party sees as a matter of concern for that’s where the party’s performance has not been consistent in previous elections and results have fluctuated. “Microplans are being made for each of these seats to analyse all possible ways that party could try to better its position on these seats or at least be confident of its win.” Each of these 84 seats may have a different and more than one reason for the party’s poor or dissatisfying performance in the previous election. The party has already deputed leaders for these seats at least six months ago. Those entrusted with the responsibility of these “weaker” zones are senior party leaders and higher-ups in the organization. “Focus is to make the party’s organization in these seats stronger. There have to more frequent visits to these places to increase dialogue with people and know what they want. A committed workforce can only sway voters in favour of BJP.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-focus-on-84-weak-seats-targets-all-403-in-22-polls/articleshow/81715119.cms||Neha Shukla

---||Pune||Night curfew in Maharashtra from tomorrow as cases spike, curbs on shop timings likely||MUMBAI: With the second Covid-19 wave rising higher and several festivals, including Holi, round the corner, the Maharashtra government on Friday announced statewide night curfew from Sunday. Curbs on shop timings are also likely. An official said a detailed notification is expected on Saturday. After a meeting to take stock of the Covid situation, CM Uddhav Thackeray said malls should shut by 8pm and cautioned that if Covid safety norms are not followed, the state will be forced to impose stricter restrictions. Currently, shops in Mumbai malls are open till 9.30pm while food courts run till 11pm. In the far northern suburbs, local authorities imposed tighter restrictions ranging from banning gathering of more than 4 people, shutting of non-essential shops, restaurants on weekends to curbs on shops timings and even banning wedding ceremonies. A doctor who attended the review meeting with CM Thackeray on Friday said many ideas were floated, from restricting train movement in suburban Mumbai to a lockdown. Another task force member, Dr Gautam Bhansali, said there is no question of a lockdown at the moment but various restrictions could be announced. “It has been decided that Mumbai needs to be closely watched for two more weeks before any hard decision is taken,” he said. Thackeray chaired the meeting with district authorities to review the state’s preparedness to tackle the second wave, mainly focusing on ramping up medical infrastructure. He also empowered the district authorities to impose localised lockdowns in their areas if cases are spiralling. “I don’t want to impose a lockdown, but given the daily numbers, there is a possibility that the health infrastructure we have created will fall short. People should understand that the threat hasn’t receded, it has only gone up,” said Thackeray. He offered the example of UK, where a lockdown was clamped for two months after the second wave. Local administrations in areas around Mumbai have already started imposing restrictions. The Mira Bhayander-Vasai Virar commissionerate on Friday prohibited gathering of four or more persons under section 144 of the CrPC till April 6. Crowds were feared for Holi, Shab-E-Baraat and Easter. In Kalyan-Dombivli, municipal commissioner Dr Vijay Suryawanshi ordered that all shops, except those selling essentials, hotels and restaurants to remain closed on weekends. Only food parcels will be allowed. In vegetable markets, only 50% shops will open. The Palghar district administration banned weddings after April 15 and said those earlier can take place between 7am and 7pm with permission from the local police station. It issued several restrictions from April 5 --- malls, shops and establishments can operate from 7am to 7pm, hawkers between 7am and 8pm, bars and restaurants can be open from 7am to 9pm, and home deliveries have to be over by 10pm. Schools, colleges and coaching classes will be shut, but Class X and XII board exams will take place according to schedule. All religious places will have to be shut by 7pm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/night-curfew-in-state-from-tomorrow-as-cases-spike-curbs-on-shop-timings-likely/articleshow/81717156.cms||Bhavika Jain

CBSE teachers, under an initiative of the Union education ministry, have created over a hundred comic books which are aligned with NCERT syllabus for Std III-XII and hope students will enjoy learning in a new way. This novel initiative was launched by Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal on Wednesday and will benefit crores of students across the country. It was a team of teachers from different CBSE-affiliated schools which worked on this project, and it was curated by National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) before being finalized. The comic books have been developed for 16 subjects and are in tune with topics of the NCERT textbooks. Every comic book has a specific storyline and characters which students and teachers can relate to. Reena Dargan, chairperson of Nagpur Sahodaya Schools Complex, said, “In olden times, we had colourful comics and we enjoyed reading them. I am convinced this initiative will help as it makes reading interesting, visualisation easy, leaves everlasting impression on child’s mind. Even abstract concepts are easy to comprehend when put in this format.” These comics can be accessed online on DIKSHA web portal (diksha.gov.in) or via the DIKSHA app on any android smartphone. On DIKSHA app, after downloading and creating a user profile, a learner can select CBSE/NCERT board from dropdown and then select relevant grade and access subject-wise comic books. The comics can also be accessed through WhatsApp through DIKSHA’s chatbot. WhatsApp India team helped in enabling the chatbot thus making comic books accessible through technology-enabled solutions. A statement by CBSE says, “The WhatsApp chatbot presents a unique opportunity to expand the scope of digital learning”. It presents a menu of options pertaining to digital learning and training on DIKSHA from which the user needs to select Comic Books and the relevant grade to start learning. “Comic books have ushered in transformation of education to personalized learning, as the 21st century schooling focuses on knowledge, skills, attitudes, values and transformative competencies, that create holistic learners,” the CBSE statement added. The central board said over a thousand teachers, from different departments and parts of the country, were involved in getting this initiative off the ground.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/reading-comic-books-in-class-may-get-you-better-grades/articleshow/81714310.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

Prant Karyawah (Regional secretary) Prashant Shukla said that the exercise is being planned in the run up to the centenary celebration of RSS in 2025. The RSS was founded by Keshav Baliram Hedgewar on September 27, 1925. “We would be able to meet the target before the centenary celebrations. The aim is to reach every village and majras,” he said. The RSS demarcates UP into six prants – Braj, Meerut (also comprising Uttarakhand), Kanpur, Awadh, Gorakhpur and Kashi (Varanasi). An RSS functionary said that Sangh seeks to reach out maximum possible people and help them develop physically, mentally and spiritually. “The 'shakhas’ are designed to help a person develop as a volunteer, a team member, a leader. They help a person to become more confident and aware. They also help with personal and professional networking, getting over shyness, fear of public speaking and other personally limiting characteristics. All the activities are mostly based on traditional Hindu or Indian practices,” he said. At the same time, the RSS has decided to carry out a special campaign to help farmers increase fertility of their land and increase their produce. Termed as 'Bhumi Suposhan Abhiyan’ (land nutrition campaign) the campaign will be carried out between April 13 and July 24, said RSS Sahprant Sanghchalak, Sunit Khare. “We would exhort the farmers to opt for organic farming and other necessary measures that could increase their productivity,” he said. The RSS farmer outreach comes amid stir by the farming community against the new farm laws. Khare said that the decision to carry out the land nutrition campaign was taken at the Akhil Bharatiya Pratinidhi Sabha of RSS which was organised in Bengaluru earlier this week. The meeting saw a change of guard in RSS Dattatreya Hosabale replacing Suresh Bhaiyya ji Joshi as Sar-Karyavah or General Secretary. The Sar-Karyavah is the one who is in charge of the organisation’s day-to-day activities. The Pratinidhi Sabha also passed the resolution on construction of Ram Temple in Ayodhya, terming the development as a golden chapter which would inspire the upcoming generations for years. The Sangh has also hailed the crowd-funding for the Ram Temple as an initiative that projects emotional bonding of people with the project. The foundation stone of Ram Temple was laid by PM Narendra Modi on August 5.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/rss-plans-big-rural-outreach-special-campaign-for-farmers/articleshow/81715150.cms||Pankaj Shah

In a letter to the chief justice of India Sharad Bobde, city environmentalists have appealed for urgent intervention of the apex court in the Ajni Vann case. Activists highlighted how over 7,000 trees of the British era in an area of 490 acres of land, which is a thriving biodiversity habitat, are going to be destroyed for the proposed intermodal station and Commercial Business Development (CBD) plan at Ajni. Activists have demanded shifting of the project to an alternative site to save the urban forest. They further pointed out that a public grievance filed by them at the Prime Minister’s Office was “disposed of by transferring it to the Central Pollution Control Board and Maharashtra Pollution Control Board.” The activists also came together to file a public interest litigation (PIL) at the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court. “The petition has an in-depth study and evidence. We filed it last December. However, it is yet to be admitted,” they stated. The activists have also attached a copy of the complaint filed with the state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray in which they pointed out that the project is coming up right in the heart of the city and is multi-phased. “The proposed land for this project is the only lush green patch left in south central Nagpur. The area has over 20,000 trees planted in the British era and have survived till date. As per the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), the multimodal hub will require cutting of over 100-year-old trees,” they stated. Calling it an emergency situation, activists further stated that cutting such large number of trees would disturb the groundwater table and dry up the few existing lakes, turning Nagpur into Delhi-NCR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/environmentalists-seek-sc-intervention-to-save-ajni-vann/articleshow/81713452.cms||Manka Behl
---||Mumbai||Night curfew in Maharashtra from tomorrow as cases spike, curbs on shop timings likely||MUMBAI: With the second Covid-19 wave rising higher and several festivals, including Holi, round the corner, the Maharashtra government on Friday announced statewide night curfew from Sunday. Curbs on shop timings are also likely. An official said a detailed notification is expected on Saturday. After a meeting to take stock of the Covid situation, CM Uddhav Thackeray said malls should shut by 8pm and cautioned that if Covid safety norms are not followed, the state will be forced to impose stricter restrictions. Currently, shops in Mumbai malls are open till 9.30pm while food courts run till 11pm. In the far northern suburbs, local authorities imposed tighter restrictions ranging from banning gathering of more than 4 people, shutting of non-essential shops, restaurants on weekends to curbs on shops timings and even banning wedding ceremonies. A doctor who attended the review meeting with CM Thackeray on Friday said many ideas were floated, from restricting train movement in suburban Mumbai to a lockdown. Another task force member, Dr Gautam Bhansali, said there is no question of a lockdown at the moment but various restrictions could be announced. “It has been decided that Mumbai needs to be closely watched for two more weeks before any hard decision is taken,” he said. Thackeray chaired the meeting with district authorities to review the state’s preparedness to tackle the second wave, mainly focusing on ramping up medical infrastructure. He also empowered the district authorities to impose localised lockdowns in their areas if cases are spiralling. “I don’t want to impose a lockdown, but given the daily numbers, there is a possibility that the health infrastructure we have created will fall short. People should understand that the threat hasn’t receded, it has only gone up,” said Thackeray. He offered the example of UK, where a lockdown was clamped for two months after the second wave. Local administrations in areas around Mumbai have already started imposing restrictions. The Mira Bhayander-Vasai Virar commissionerate on Friday prohibited gathering of four or more persons under section 144 of the CrPC till April 6. Crowds were feared for Holi, Shab-E-Baraat and Easter. In Kalyan-Dombivli, municipal commissioner Dr Vijay Suryawanshi ordered that all shops, except those selling essentials, hotels and restaurants to remain closed on weekends. Only food parcels will be allowed. In vegetable markets, only 50% shops will open. The Palghar district administration banned weddings after April 15 and said those earlier can take place between 7am and 7pm with permission from the local police station. It issued several restrictions from April 5 --- malls, shops and establishments can operate from 7am to 7pm, hawkers between 7am and 8pm, bars and restaurants can be open from 7am to 9pm, and home deliveries have to be over by 10pm. Schools, colleges and coaching classes will be shut, but Class X and XII board exams will take place according to schedule. All religious places will have to be shut by 7pm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/night-curfew-in-state-from-tomorrow-as-cases-spike-curbs-on-shop-timings-likely/articleshow/81716185.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Pune||NFAI acquires 23 films, including Marathi works||Pune: The National Film Archive of India (NFAI) has acquired 89 celluloid reels of both 16mm and 35mm films, mostly Marathi and some Hindi movies, including ones that were thought to have been lost for good. All of them are monochrome films and released between 50s and 70s. The flagship films received by NFAI are Tai Teleen (1953), and Pavankathacha Dhondi (1966), both of whose original reels were assumed to have been lost from the public domain. Tai Teleen is a historical film directed by KP Bhave, while doyens of Marathi cinema such as Shanta Apte and Zunzarrao Pawar starred in Anto Narhari. Pavankathacha Dhondi, directed by Anant Thakur, was produced, scored, and acted in by legends of the Marathi film industry, with Thakur, a filmmaker of repute, having worked with Raj Kapoor in the film Chori Chori. While the film was produced by Usha Mangeshkar, the music was composed by her brother Hridaynath, with Jayashree Gadkar and brothers Chandrakant and Suryakant in lead roles. Another highlight of the collection is a Ram Gabale film Dev Pavala (1950). The film starring Damuanna Malavankar and Vishnupant Jog was shot at Prabhat Studio in Pune. “We have to always be on the lookout for such films. These two films, for example, were considered lost. I met Ushaji a few years back and she alerted me about the film’s existence. Now, we have received the film,” said Prakash Magdum, NFAI director. Other titles gathered by NFAI include Shakti Samanta’s black and white film Naughty Boy, starring Kishore Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/nfai-acquires-23-films-including-marathi-works/articleshow/81713449.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Sunrise allowed ‘as exception’ to treat Covid in health staff||MUMBAI: A hospital inside Dreams Mall was first proposed in 2014, but the plan was stalled. Eventually, it began operating on a provisional Occupation Certificate (OC) granted in May 2020 during the pandemic, even though the building which housed it had got notices for construction irregularities and fire safety violations. BMC in May 2020 gave a provisional OC to the now gutted Sunrise Hospital as a special case due to “exceptional circumstances” created by the pandemic. The hospital owned by Privilege Health Care received temporary permission to run as a Covid facility despite irregularities in the building. The approval given on May 6, 2020, was for treatment of only health and frontline workers. “In view of the exceptional circumstances of Covid epidemic, all hospitals need to be mobilized. Therefore to keep one hospital specially for health and frontline workers, this ‘Occupation Certificate (Provisional)’ specifically limited to only HOSPITAL PREMISES” was granted, says the BMC document. A BMC official said part of the mall comprising basement, ground, first and second floors received an OC in 2011. Problems linked to unauthorised alterations began subsequently. “The hospital was given a provisional OC in May 2020, but it got permission from the health department to start admitting patients only in October 2020,” said Vibhas Achrekar, assistant municipal commissioner, S Ward. Later “some complaints” about “overcharging” surfaced and a notice was issued to the hospital for exceeding fixed Covid-19 treatment rates, he said. Officials said the director of Privilege Health Care, Dr Nikita Trehan, applied to BMC on April 25, 2020, offering to turn the hospital into a Covid care facility of 250 beds. Approval was given by the municipal commissioner on the basis of the representation made by Dr Trehan. BMC’s building proposal wing said in its note that a Provisional OC was being “issued by delinking all the issues in the project…, conditions as per this office ‘Intimation of Disapproval’ dated 29.06.2004, all other approvals related with the project… also compliance with respect to any reservations as reflected in Development Plan-2034, shall be complied with before...any further approval.” The OC was issued without compliance of “mandatory requirements” due to the Covid situation, says the note issued by Lotan Ahire, Executive Engineer (BP) Eastern Suburbs-2. According to officials, the health department's permission to operate a Covid hospital was to expire on March 31 this year but since over 70 Covid patients were under treatment here, they would have got an extension. "We gave them permission till March 31 to run the hospital since they had a provisional OC and they had to make several compliances. We would have inspected the hospital to check for compliance before giving any extension," said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner (Health). According to officials, the plan for a hospital inside Dreams Mall was conceived in 2014, three years after the commercial space came up. Dreams was touted as Asia’s largest by the Housing Development and Infrastructure Ltd promoted by the Wadhawans, who are under arrest for defrauding Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative Bank. The mall, designed by Hafeez Contractor as a vast, multi-level shopping experience, was located on the busy LBS Marg in Bhandup. But it remained a non-starter with more than half the space still unsold. Officials said Dreams Mall was sent a notice for irregularities and poor compliance of fire safety norms in November last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sunrise-allowed-as-exception-to-treat-covid-in-health-staff/articleshow/81715169.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Kanpur Nagar commissionerate will have six deputy commissioners of police (DCPs) of SP-rank followed by two additional commissioners of police (ACP) of DIG-rank and a commissioner of police. Varanasi will have five DCPs, followed by two additional commissioners of police and a CP. It will also have a special DCP (intelligence). A senior police officer said that 34 police stations of Kanpur Nagar would be divided into three police zones. Three other DCPs will be for headquarters, crime and traffic, taking the total to six. In Varanasi, 18 police stations will be divided into two police zones, each headed by a DCP, while three other DCPs will be for crime/traffic, intelligence/security and headquarters. “We have ensured that Kanpur (outer) has sufficient strength with 11 police stations to headed by a separate SP (Kanpur Outer). He will work under the IG, Kanpur range. In Varanasi, 10 police stations have been clubbed under Varanasi (rural) which will be headed by an SP-rank officer who will work under IG, Varanasi range,” a police officer said. Former DGP Sulkhan Singh told TOI that commissionerate is the best policing model across the world for urban centres. “We cannot depend on a sub-inspector and magistrate to deliver results in SP-centeric policing model,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/two-new-commissioner-systems-to-work-on-noida-model/articleshow/81715174.cms||---
---||Delhi||Land delay for sewage plants: Chadha meets LG||New Delhi: Vice-chairman of Delhi Jal Board (DJB) Raghav Chadha met lieutenant governor Anil Baijal on Friday to expedite notification of norms for allotment of land. He alleged that delayed land allotment by Delhi Development Authority (DDA) for decentralised sewage treatment plants (DSTPs) was a major impediment in creating new infrastructure to treat sewage at local level. The jal board needed land pockets in 37 locations owned by DDA and 24 locations under Delhi government. A DJB spokesperson said that during the meeting, Chadha informed Baijal about the inordinate delay by DDA in allotment of gram sabha lands and private land for construction of DSTPs. Later, Chadha tweeted that he had a fruitful meeting with the LG on land-related matters pertaining to the upcoming decentralised sewage treatment plants and sewerage pumping stations. In a letter to the LG, Chadha stated that DJB did not have its own land in areas where DSTPs and pumping stations were to be installed. “Formal requests were made to the revenue department and DDA for allocation of such free land as they were virtually the custodians of the government land. The respective locations had already been identified and inspected jointly by the officers of revenue department and in some cases DDA,” the letter said. The communication said that to achieve the target of clean Yamuna, the matter of extending sewerage services to cover entire Delhi was being monitored by National Green Tribunal, ministry of urban development, ministry of Jal Shakti, Delhi Pollution Control Committee and Central Pollution Control Board so that no untreated sewage was released in drains. Chadha stated that earlier the issue of providing land was being pursued with the divisional commissioner as he was deemed to be the custodian of gram sabha lands, but DJB was later informed that most of the lands requested to be allotted — which were in rural areas — had been urbanised and DDA was now the authority to deal with them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/land-delay-for-sewage-plants-chadha-meets-lg/articleshow/81714426.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The leakage was plugged and water supply restored in the area by Thursday evening. Local residents were upset over water supply getting disrupted without warning. Noted author and the member of a Supreme Court monitoring committee Hugh Gantzer, who lives in Kincraig neighbourhood, said, “While Jal Sansthan officials told me that the disruption was due to road construction work by National Highway Authority of India (NHAI), NHAI officials categorically denied it. This is a clear lack of coordination between departments as well as accountability and transparency. It has resulted in loss of thousands of litres of water,” said Gantzer. In another incident before this, laying cables for a telecom company damaged a water supply line on the Mall Road. As a result, there was no water in parts of Mall Road throughout Tuesday. “The water supply stopped abruptly and didn’t resume till the evening,” said Ravinder, a resident of Mall Road who uses only his first name. Another resident, who did not wish to be named, said, “Considering Mussoorie already suffers from water scarcity, such incidents are worrying. The Jal Sansthan must strictly avoid such incidents now that summer is here.” Hoteliers on the Mall Road also said that while water supply disruption isn’t much of a problem right now, it might cause trouble when the tourist season starts in earnest. Trepan Singh Rawat, assistant engineer of Jal Sansthan, admitted that the pipelines had been damaged and that water supply had consequently been disrupted. “We are keeping a strict vigil so that water isn’t wasted again,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/water-supply-stops-in-mussoorie-neighbourhoods-as-pipelines-break-down/articleshow/81713457.cms||Anmol Jain
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Malls can be fire traps, having a hospital inside is ridiculous’||MUMBAI: The fire that killed 11 patients at Sunrise Hospital in Mumbai is the second major blaze inside a mall in the city. Some experts say malls are often fire traps because of the presence of multiple users carrying out various activities and not suitable to house a hospital, especially on higher floors. October last year, Orchid City Centre Mall in central Mumbai was engulfed by a Level-5 fire, necessitating a ‘brigade call’ for assistance from all fire engines in the city and forcing complete evacuation of the 55-floor Orchid Enclave building above it. It took 56 hours to extinguish the fire and another two days for the building to cool down. The entire mall was gutted. Fire brigade officers said the blaze at Dreams may have started on the lower floors that house commercial spaces; the hospital is located on the third storey. Structural engineer Shirish Patel said malls can at most have an emergency health centre. “Having a hospital with beds inside a mall is a ridiculous idea… there can be a first aid centre or an emergency health response centre at most but not a hospital with beds and ICUs,” Patel said. BJP MLA Mihir Kotecha said, “Most malls are fire traps, there is very poor compliance of fire norms…there is a dearth of hospitals for Covid patients and that's why the BMC gave permission to open the hospital in a mall, but these decisions will have to be reviewed,” Kotecha said. In December 2017, another major fire had broken out at Kamala Mills in Lower Parel killing 14 people. “Malls are often fire traps since there are multiple users and many times there is change of designated space. There are food courts and kitchens, cylinders and air conditioning units. Since most of the spaces are on rent, fire safety compliance is very poor too,” said a former fire officer.—Chaitanya Marpakwar||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-malls-can-be-fire-traps-having-a-hosp-inside-is-ridiculous/articleshow/81715220.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Giving this information to reporters here on Friday, All-India Kisan Sabha general secretary Atul Kumar Anjaan said that the farmers organisations, which have been protesting against the farm laws enacted by the Union government, had given the bandh call. Claiming that the bandh received a full support of people, especially the youth, women and workers, Anjaan said that it got a tremendous response in Punjab, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand and Bihar. In western UP most of the markets wore a deserted look, the AIKS general secretary said, adding that in eastern UP, too, the bandh evoked a good response. Regretting that at some places policemen were seen exerting pressure on shopkeepers to open their establishments, Anjaan also cited several incidents where protesters had to face the police wrath. He said that over 500 farmer organisations and at least 10 central trade unions had extended full support to the farmers’ bandh call.

The action is part of an ongoing drive. In this case, it was found that fictitious entries to the tune of Rs 3,000 crore were recorded to avail fake ITC of Rs 282 crore. The entries were recorded through 15 different dummy firms located in Thane and Nashik ultimately benefiting a firm in Mumbai. Action was taken by the Nagpur zonal unit of DGGSTI whose jurisdiction extends up to Nashik. Sources said even dummy companies have been paying GST through fake credit for fictitious sales recorded in their books. This is because the current system allows showing the GST liability payment through credit, even if it’s not actually there with the seller. Due to this illegal practice, the government does not get any revenue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/six-held-in-fake-itc-case/articleshow/81714381.cms||---

Records show that they are paid between Rs 12,000 and Rs 15,000, but they actually get much less. If they protest, they are threatened with removal from work,” he said.He added that more than one judgment of the apex court says that if a person is forced to work for less than the minimum wage, it is bonded labour. Mevani said that more than Rs 2,000 crore meant for the welfare of construction workers, is lying unused.Responding to Mevani, labour and employment minister Dilip Thakore promised to look into the issue of security guards and sanitation workers at the MLA quarters and circuit houses not getting the minmum wage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/workers-at-mla-quarters-get-less-than-minimum-wage/articleshow/81714427.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal asks private hospitals to add more Covid beds as cases take a leap||KOLKATA: The state health department on Friday asked private hospitals in Kolkata to scale up the number of Covid beds as the city witnessed a sharp spike in number of fresh cases. From Thursday to Friday, the figures jumped from 167 to 239. At an online meeting, health secretary N S Nigam advised hospitals to monitor the situation and ensure that no Covid patient is refused admission and all arrangements for treatment are kept ready. Those who don’t have Covid beds were asked to introduce them by Monday. New cases in Kolkata had breached the three-digit figure last Saturday after a two-month hiatus and has kept rising, sparking concerns among health experts and frontline health workers. Most hospitals said even though the number of patients has increased, they have enough vacancies to accommodate more over the next few days. Some warned that an increase in Covid beds may force them to restrict non-Covid admissions and Swasthya Sathi patients. AMRI Hospital, for instance, has decided to add beds immediately. “We have 55 Covid beds now and we are adding 12 ITU beds on Saturday. Occupancy is less than 50% but we are ready to add more. But given that a large number of Swasthya Sathi patients are taking up beds, we might not be able to accept all,” said AMRI CEO Rupak Barua. Medica Superspecialty Hospital, which has increased its Covid capacity recently, plans to stop Swasthya Sathi admissions if the number of Covid patients rise. “We will be left with no other option,” said chairperson Alok Roy. RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) has 40 beds now and it will wait for occupancy to rise, said zonal head R Venkatesh. “Depending on the occupancy, we are ready to expand our Covid unit,” said Venkatesh. Meanwhile, most hospitals have deferred the date for the second dose of Covishield by at least two weeks. Some private hospitals in Kolkata said that it will not be possible for them to individually contact every recipient who has already got the first dose and offer a new, deferred time slot. Others, however, have started drawing up fresh dates and yet others are giving recipients, who are turning up after four weeks, the option of seeking a deferred slot. Last week, a central advisory said that Covishield has been proved to be more effective if the two shots have a time gap of 6-8 weeks, though the overall recommended gap between doses remains 4-8 weeks. The time gap between the doses of Covaxin remain unchanged. RTIICS has been calling up recipients with fresh dates. “Many senior citizens, however, are taking it on the pre-scheduled date since they want to avoid travelling again,” said Venkatesh. Peerless Hospital has been calling up recipients with deferred dates.  “We are calling up those who have got the first shot and allotting them a date between six and eight weeks from the first shot,” said Peerless CEO Sudipta Mitra. Ruby Hospital, too, is allotting new dates. AMRI has deferred the second dose for both Covishield and Covaxin recipients. While the Dhakuria unit is administering both, the Mukundapur and Salt Lake units are administering only Covishield.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-asks-pvt-hosps-to-add-more-cov-beds-as-cases-take-a-leap/articleshow/81713468.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Nagpur||MahaMetro completes 52% work of balanced cantilever bridge||NAGPUR: MahaMetro is all set to give an iconic structure to the city which aims to connect people from old Nagpur to the rest of the city. The agency has completed 52% work of the balanced cantilever bridge on the east-west corridor between the Sitabuldi interchange and proposed Prajapati Nagar metro station. Once completed, the metro train will travel at an approximate height of 25 metres. The balanced cantilever bridge, popularly known as the cantilever construction bridge, is a method mainly adopted under the circumstance of irregular and long spans, congested project site, rough and water terrain, rail crossings and environmentally sensitive areas. “After discussions with Central Railway, experts and carrying out site inspection, feasibility, survey construction of the balance cantilever bridge was found to be the optimal solution in terms of construction, safety and economical as well. The CLC bridge is scheduled to be completed by October 2021 as per the planning. Its completion will not only be a master key in view of the commissioning of the Reach-4 section of MahaMetro but will also be one of the iconic structures of Nagpur City,” stated a press release by MahaMetro. In another development, officials from the Commissioner of Metro Rail Safety (CMRS) conducted inspection of metro stations at Dharampeth College, Congress Nagar, Chatrapati Square and Ujjwal Nagar. The metro station at Dharampeth College has been built on an ‘aqua theme’. If CMRS is satisfied with the arrangements, it will issue a certificate following which the stations would get operational.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mahametro-completes-52-work-of-balanced-cantilever-bridge/articleshow/81714413.cms||Manka Behl
---||Nagpur||Day 2: Corrective steps ensure smooth conduct of Nagpur University exams||NAGPUR: Rectifying all technical glitches faced a day before, Nagpur University (NU) managed to smoothly conduct all its papers of winter 2020 examinations of over 18,000 students on Friday. Barring minor complaints from the students about poor connectivity issues, all papers of BCCA, BSc and BTech went off without any major hiccups unlike Thursday when NU faced the ignominy of cancelling all exams involving over 10,000 students. Vice-chancellor Subhash Chaudhari and Board of Examination and Evaluation (BOEE) director Prafulla Sable removed the bug in online system on Thursday evening after which about 5,000 examinees logged in successfully. Of them, 2,657 submitted their papers till 8pm while others dropped midway. “We would be rescheduling papers of remaining students shortly. Even from among 2,657 students, who submitted papers but still weren’t satisfied, would be granted another chance,” the VC told TOI. He admitted that NU received some complaints from the students, but those were mostly related to internet connectivity. “We had clearly mentioned in our instructions that they shouldn’t use dongle and hotspots for exams as their speed is lower. We categorically mentioned that they must have speed of 5 MBPS for wired devices and 1 MBPS for mobiles,” he said. The VC added that due to lack of time, they couldn’t conduct mock tests for the students in advance, else these issues would have been sorted out before the exams. “We hardly had 20 days for setting up the entire system,” he said. Sable, who also heaved a sigh of relief after completing second day’s papers without any obstacles, said they would be facing bigger challenge on Saturday when over 30,000 students appear for engineering, BA and other exams. “Today, we had 93.71% attendance, but when we inquired about this large number of absentees, we got to know that many students who had applied for exams had already cleared their papers, which were kept withheld for one or the other reason. We’ve received some complaints from places like Bhandara rural and Ramtek as the examinees faced connectivity issues,” he told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/day-2-corrective-steps-ensure-smooth-conduct-of-nu-exams/articleshow/81713505.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Lucknow||Nishad Party to send signed letters to PMO||Lucknow: A two-month signature campaign that the Nishad Party launched in February in support of its demand for the SC status for Nishad community in UP is about to end. The party has started collecting details from every district about the number of signatures and signed letters that the party has received. “We are getting the numbers counted for every district,” said party’s UP in charge Shravan Nishad. “We will send truckloads of signed letters and papers in support of our demands to the PM and Parliament,” he said. The party has planned to send the signatures to PMO to highlight its long pending demand at the national level. The party’s move is driven by its ambition to be more visible ahead of the state assembly elections and also be in a better position to bargain. The signature campaign, the first such move by the party, might push it to the national political scene. It has entrusted its booth-level workers with the job to collect as many signatures in support of its demand as possible. The drive has continued without a break since it was launched in the start of February. In UP, Nishads have been demanding inclusion in the SC category under four generic castes — Majhwar, Gond, Shilpkar and Turaha. UP has 153 sub-castes of Nishads. Some of which are in the OBC list, some in the list of denotified tribes and others in the SC list. Nishads want a common status for all, which is of an SC. The state had in April 2019 did issue a ‘majhwar’ certificate to Nishads in few districts, but the court later put a stay on it. The state government has not pleaded to the court in favour of Nishads till now, which brings the community back to the point from where they started their political fight.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/nishad-party-to-send-signed-letters-to-pmo/articleshow/81715184.cms||Neha Shukla

The response was so poor that the civic body was having difficulty meeting the inoculation target. But things have turned around dramatically now. The rise in Covid-19 cases has triggered a rush for vaccination with many centres having to turn down people as they don't have enough vaccines to administer to everyone. From 5,000 shots a day three weeks ago, KMC is now giving 7,000 shots daily at 69 sites. With the vaccination pool getting enlarged to include citizens above 45 years from April 1, KMC plans to increase the number of sites to 80 and is targeting 10,000 shots a day. According to a KMC health department senior official, elderly citizens were making a beeline in front of the KMC vaccination centres at the ward level every morning ever since cases have registered a sharp rise. In fact, at some centres, vaccines are running out of stock and the civic staff on duty are being compelled to refuse a section of applicants as the number of elderly citizens and those with co-morbidity are turning up in large numbers. “We can at best arrange vaccination for around 110 people daily. But citizens, mostly elderly ones, are turning up beyond our calculations. As the daily stock expires, we are advising elderly citizens to visit our vaccination centres the next day,” said a KMC health department executive officer. According to a civic official, some of the centres that have been witnessing a spurt in the number of elderly citizens are in areas like Garia, Patuli, Baghajatin, Layelka, Garfa, Behala, Entally, Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road, College Street, Bidhan Sarani, Beadon Street and Burrabazar, among others. Khalil Ahmed, the newly appointed administrator for the KMC, on Friday held a meeting with senior civic officials, including the chief municipal health officer (CMHO), and took stock of the vaccination status ward-wise. Ahmed asked the civic officials to scale up the civic infrastructure to tackle the rush from April 1. According to a plan, the KMC will increase its stock of vaccines at each of its vaccination centres from April 1. “At a preliminary level, we will stock around 130 vaccines at each of our centres. It will be increased slowly. We have already sent a requisition to the state health department for supply of more vaccines to deal with the rush,” a KMC health official said. The KMC health department will also engage extra manpower at each of the 80 vaccination centres. “We will rearrange our workers and send them to vaccination centres that may experience heavy rush,” said a KMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/covid-case-spike-leads-to-rush-at-civic-jab-centres/articleshow/81713477.cms||Saikat Ray

While some argued that the mutated strains may not be resisted by vaccines, others pointed out that both Covishield and Covaxin were designed to provide enough coverage to justify the jab. If some argued that Covaxin could be a better wall against mutated strains, others felt that Covishield was more precise. Live updates: Coronavirus pandemicCovaxin helps to generate antibodies against all proteins of the virus and not just the spike protein, pointed out Peerless Hospital microbiologist Bhaskar Narayan Choudhury. “Covishield generates antibodies against the spike protein but not the rest. Covaxin provides a more wide coverage and is theoretically more effective against mutant strains. But we must accept whatever we get and we can’t choose. Moreover, we are not yet sure how the virus works, so the assumption may not be correct,” said Choudhury. Read Also‘Unusual’ reinfection case surprises doctors, samples sent to NIV PuneAmid a sudden spike in infections, an unusual Covid-19 case reported at a private hospital has caught the doctors by surprise. Despite the previous infection, one dose of vaccine and good antibodies, the patient developed moderately Covid pneumonia requiring oxygen is not the first time she testedBelle Vue internal medicine consultant Rahul Jain agreed. “We don’t have enough genomic studies on Covid yet to come to a conclusion. But generally, Covishield acts against the spike protein. It means that it can generate antibodies that will work only on the spikes but not the whole virus. Covaxin, on the other hand, provides a more comprehensive and long-lasting protection,” he said. Read AlsoNew double mutant Covid-19 variant found in India: What we know so farA new double mutant Covid-19 variant has been found in India, said the government on Wednesday. Several Variants of Concerns (VOCs) have been found in India previously, however, the ministry of health said that the cases of new variants are limited in number. Govt said it could not be sufficientlyElaborating further, Jain said Covaxin-triggered antibodies were like snipers that can identify the enemy from any part of its structure. “It destroys the whole structure more effectively,” Jain said. Mutated strains, however, make a large section of the population – that has either had the infection or got the vaccine or had both – susceptible to Covid yet again, said CMRI Hospital director of pulmonology Raja Dhar. “Additionally, mutated strains are more transmissible,” said Dhar. He, however, added that it didn’t negate the vaccine, though. “Vaccines will be effective to varying degrees, depending on mutations and multiple other factors. At this juncture, everyone should take it without thinking about efficacy. It is sure to provide at least 60%-65% protection, which makes a big difference,” added Dhar. Bhaskar Narayan Choudhury agreed. “The double mutant strain is set to trigger an explosion in cases. Mutated strains are more infectious but they tend to lose virulence. So far, we have no evidence of its behaviour but going by the sharp rise in cases, we may assume that mutations are at work,” said Choudhury.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/covishield-or-covaxin-mutant-strains-raise-concerns-over-vaccine-efficacy/articleshow/81713494.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

Hota (45) first worked as a visiting faculty at a number of universities for a few years and then started a college of his own. But he had to shut it down due to malpractices and lack of quality faculty. In huge debt, he took to crime. The accused formed a gang and started duping job aspirants on the pretext of placing them with MNCs in high positions. The cyber cell has busted the gang and arrested five of its members. They have allegedly duped over 500 people of around Rs 7.5 crore, police said. According to DCP (cyber cell) Anyesh Roy, the accused targeted only very well-qualified people who were looking for top management jobs so that he could coax them into paying more money. The accused had recruited two engineers who could speak fluent English and had excellent convincing skills. The cops started tracking the gang after receiving a complaint from a victim who lost around Rs 20 lakh to the fraudsters. “The victim, a resident of Uttam Nagar, stated that he was contacted by some unknown persons who pretended to be having the franchisee of several recruitment agencies. Eventually, they later claimed to be officials at senior management level in India’s leading companies and cheated him of almost Rs 20 lakh on the pretext of providing him a job with a conglomerate,” DCP Roy added. They made him deposit the money in various bank accounts. “During investigation, analysis of the mobile numbers used by criminals was done, the money trail was established and the location of the accused was zeroed down upon. A raid was conducted by the team at the illegal call centre that the accused were running in Gurugram and five persons were arrested from the spot, including the mastermind Manoj Hota,” DCP Roy added. Seven computers and laptops and 14 mobile phones were recovered from the accused. The two engineers were identified as Ashish and Abhishek. The other two employees were identified as Sonu and Shaik. They are in their mid and late twenties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mba-phd-holder-and-also-a-conman/articleshow/81714456.cms||---

Ahir, along with the PAPs and people’s representatives, walked nearly 25km in the scorching heat. He began his tour from Baranj Manora Phata and walked on foot all the way to the district collectorate with his supporters. The key demand was revoking mining permission to KPCL mine for failure of the company to pay pending compensation to PAPs and carry out their rehabilitation. He demanded reinstatement of the miners who were dismissed in 2015 when the mine was closed down. Payment of their pending salaries too was raised through the agitation. Ahir claimed that the mine was started in 2007 after acquiring 1,457 hectares from 804 farmers. However, the company has yet not paid the collective compensation of Rs185.7 crore. “The company also did injustice to local people in giving jobs. While a person each from 804 project-affected families should have got a job, the company gave jobs to only 166 people,” Ahir said. “Moreover, the workers dismissed after the mine was closed down in 2015 have not been reinstated and their pending salaries are yet to be paid. Despite strong demand from PAPs, the collector gave permission for mining to KPCL under pressure of the guardian minister and Congress leaders,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ex-minister-ahir-takes-out-march-to-raise-paps-demands/articleshow/81714448.cms||Mazhar Ali

A Mirzapur rural court had issued a non-bailable warrant against Patel on February 11, 2020 for not appearing before the court during proceedings in a case registered in Bopal police station for violation of public notification in December 2017.

Many private schools are forcing parents to deposit the entire school fees of 2020-21 by March 31 and threatening to hold the results otherwise. This is despite specific guidelines of the Supreme Court that fees can be paid in six instalments. Dipti Tiwari, a parent whose children go to a private school in Jawahar Nagar, said that a few days back school authorities visited her house to cajole her to pay the fees. “I felt like they were trying to assess the standard of living of our family. We have no objection of paying the fees but why should we pay library or sports fee. It is not possible to pay such hefty amount of fees after pandemic for every parent. Also, we are waiting for the final order of the Supreme Court,” said Tiwari. A few days back parents protested in two private schools who had hiked the fees of 2021-22 session. After detail discussions with the school authority, they decided to stay the fees as of now. In Malviya Nagar parents protested because the private school hold the result of the students whose parents haven’t paid the fees. After lot of protest by the parents they finally budge. Manish Vijayvargiya, head of Abhibhavak Ekta Andolan, organised a press conference with parents of different private school on Friday. He said that schools are acting in a dictatorial manner, “We are receiving distress calls by the parents that private schools are forcing them to pay full fees or else the results of their children are kept on hold. Supreme Court’s interim order clearly states that schools cannot hold the result and fees will be paid in six instalments starting from March. This is sheer dictatorial behaviour from private schools,” said Vijyavargiya. Box Office-bearers of parents’ assn meet commissioner Acting on the complaint of private schools against the parents’ associations of Jaipur, police commissioner Anand Srivastav summoned the office-bearers of such bodies on Friday. Private schools had complained against the parents’ association that they are creating nuisance in the institutes. The meeting between the office-bearers of parents’ associations and Srivastav held on Friday in which parents said they were asked to restrict their activities. Sunil Yadav, president of All Rajasthan Parents Forum, said that the commissioner asked them not create nuisance in the schools. “We were clear from our side that if police want, they can watch CCTV cameras in the schools if we have ever created nuisance. The commissioner tried to argue that they have received complaints that school environment is disrupted due to this, but we said that they must present some evidence,” said Yadav. Police asked the office-bearers to register a statement, but they refused to give the written copy of the complaint by private schools. So, even the parents refused to register any statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/schools-hike-fees-by-12-20-in-city-parents-protest/articleshow/81713512.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Four-phase UP panchayat elections from April 15||LUCKNOW: The much-awaited three-tier panchayat elections in the state would be held in four phases starting April 15. The State Election Commission (SEC) on Friday announced the notification for the polls, touted as a semi-final electoral battle before the high-stake assembly elections next year. With this, the model code of conduct came into effect in the state. The announcement came on the day when the Supreme Court was to hear a petition challenging the Allahabad high court’s order dated March 15 that directed UP government to take 2015 as the base year instead of 1995 for reserving seats for the three-tier rural local bodies elections. SEC Manoj Kumar announced that panchayat elections would be conducted in four phases - April 15, April 19, April 26 and April 29. Counting of votes and declaration of result will take place on May 2. The voting would be held through paper ballots. Unlike in the past when elections were conducted block-wise, the panchayat elections, this time, would be held district-wise. In the first phase, 18 districts, including Gorakhpur, Ayodhya, Prayagraj, Kanpur, Bareilly and Ghaziabad would go to polls. The second phase would see elections being held on 20 districts including Lucknow, Varanasi, Gautam Buddh nagar, Azamgarh and Muzzaffarnagar. Likewise, in the third phase, 20 districts including Kanpur Dehat, Unnao, Jalaun and Amethi, would go to polls. The fourth phase will see electoral contest in 17 districts, including Bulandshahr, Aligarh, Mathura, Bahraich and Sonbhadra. The elections would, however, not be held in three gram panchayats of Sitapur (Kainhara Raghuwardayal, Batpurwa and Raipaidihiya), one of Bahraich (Kapoorpur) and nine of Gonda (Bahadura, Khanpur, Sarawan, Jalalpur, Ballipur, Mohanpur), Sahibapur, Parsiya and Rampur Kharhata). SEC Officials said that the said rural local bodies in three districts have not completed their tenure. The nomination process for the first phase would start on April 3, for second phase on April 7, for third phase on April 13 and for fourth phase on April 17. The candidates would be given election symbols between April 7 and April 21. Kumar said that the district magistrates/district election officer (panchayat) will issue the notice on Friday itself, before getting them published in the state gazette and informing the state election commission. The nomination papers will be available from Saturday after due notice by the district electoral officer. The district authorities have also been asked to ensure adequate awareness, including using 'munadi’ (spreading information with the help of drummers) about the panchayat elections. He said that the elections would be conducted as per the procedures laid down under Panchayati Raj (elections of members and Pradhans)- 1994. The counting of votes for various rural local bodies will be held at the development block level. Scheduled to be held under the shadow of pandemic, the panchayat elections will be conducted as per the due Corona protocols recently issued by the state poll panel. Under this, more than five persons will not be allowed to accompany during the door-to-door campaign. The candidates will have to take due permission from the commission to hold a public rally. Officials said that the poll scheduled has been drafted in a way to lessen the impact on UP board examinations which are also scheduled to be held in April and May. Various political parties have already thrown their weight behind the candidates contesting the panchayat elections which are though not held on party symbols. The BJP has already gone into an overdrive while carrying out booth level campaigns to make deeper rural inroads before the big fight in 2022. The SP and the BSP too seek to consolidate their position in the rural areas which determine the electoral fortunes of parties in the politically crucial state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/4-phase-up-panchayat-elections-from-april-15/articleshow/81715276.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Jaipur||Delhi police file FIR, begin to probe Raj phone-tapping case||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police’s crime branch filed an FIR on Thursday and began investigating the Rajasthan phone-tapping case on a complaint lodged by Union Minister and Jodhpur MP Gajendra Singh Shekhawat. Shekhawat, who resides at Akbar Road in Delhi, had lodged a complaint at nearby Tughlak Road Police station a week ago. The complaint was transferred to the crime branch.  Shekhawat has alleged violation of privacy and offences under the IT Act pertaining to illegal access to telephonic intercepts, sources said. The incident pertains to last year when Congress leader Sachin Pilot and other MLAs stood against chief minister Gehlot's leadership and the MLAs were lodged in hotels. Shekhawat, who handles the Jal Shakti portfolio, has alleged in his complaint that on July 17, 2020, various media houses had aired some telephonic conversations, allegedly between one Sanjay Jain, Bhanwar Lal Sharma, an MLA from Rajasthan, and the complainant (Shekhawat). The intercepts, Shekhawat has alleged, were illegally leaked to news channels by Lokesh Sharma, OSD to Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot.  “Under the existing law, detailed guidelines/rules have been issued to safeguard against illegal access and misuse of telephonic intercepts by unauthorised persons. Intercepted telephonic communication is required to be kept in safe custody of authorised officials who are responsible for preventing illegal access and misuse of the same,” a source said. The source added that any breach of such custody of telephonic intercepts amounts to criminal breach of trust by public servants who are the custodians of such telephonic intercepts. “From the contents of the complaint and material on record, it is found that not only is there a criminal conspiracy and breach of criminal confidentiality and privacy in this matter, but there is also disclosure of information and breach of lawful contract,” an official said. The official added that telegraphic signals were divulged to persons not entitled to become acquainted with the same. “Prima facie offences under Section 26 of the Indian Telegraph Act, read with Secs 72 and 72A of the Information Technology Act, read with IPC Secs 409 (criminal breach of trust) and 120B (conspiracy) are likely committed in the case. Thus a probe has been initiated,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/delhi-police-file-fir-begin-to-probe-raj-phone-tapping-case/articleshow/81714453.cms||---
---||Kochi||Bogus votes: Congress delegation meets CEC||KOCHI: A delegation of Congress leaders on Friday met the election commissioners in the Central Election Commission and alleged that the Pinarayi Vijayan-led LDF government was “committing a fraud” in collusion with officials of the state election machinery by inducting “dubious voters, double voters and voters with fraudulent identities” into the voters list. Party chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala, after meeting the EC officials, told reporters that the delegation pointed out three particular instances of fraud - same voter registered in different booths; person’s name, father’s name and photograph being same but registered as a voter in different assembly constituencies; and photograph of voter remaining same but the name changing in different IDs. “The commission has informed us that in the eight constituencies, where specific evidence was given, the chief electoral officer (CEO) has been given a written direction to look into the matter and clean the list, failing which action will be taken against the CEO. The EC has also deputed an official from Delhi to supervise the cleaning of the voters’ list,” Surjewala said. Earlier, opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala had alleged that the CPM has a major role in the creation of bogus votes and the party used various service associations for it. During the ‘meet the press’ programme organized by Ernakulam Press Club on Friday, Chennithala said that up to 10,000 bogus votes were created in each constituency to sabotage the fair conduct of the election. “People of Kerala do not want LDF to continue at the helm. But CPM is trying to sabotage people’s will by creating bogus votes. We have found that in each constituency there are between 1,000 and 10,000 bogus votes and the Marxist party has a major role in it. They have used service associations for creating bogus votes. That is why the chief minister is trivializing the issue. We have received information that in many places CPM is making arrangements to erase the indelible ink mark so that bogus voters can cast their votes. It is a serious issue and the EC must take action,” Chennithala said. Chennithala also challenged the CM to order a judicial inquiry into the deep-sea fishing deal with EMCC International. “If I had not brought the issue to the fore, the government would have silently proceeded with the deal.” He said the government’s move to distribute kits for Vishu was in violation of the code and the complaint filed by Congress will not be withdrawn.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/bogus-votes-congress-delegation-meets-cec/articleshow/81712735.cms||---

This Earth Hour, across India, we witnessed various landmarks participating in the global switch-off to speak up for nature. Some landmarks that stood in solidarity with Earth Hour 2021 by switching off their lights were Rashtrapati Bhavan, India Gate, Shanti Stupa, Ladakh, Royal Mysore Palace, Qutub Minar, National Defence Academy (NDA), Pune, Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus, Mumbai. The Covid-19 pandemic has revealed to us a situation of utmost urgency concerning the human-nature balance. The destruction that the pandemic got with itself was disastrous, the consequences of which we are still witnessing is a warning for us to speak up for nature and connect to the earth. Earth Hour celebrated this year on March 27, is the largest global grassroots movement for the environment, every year brings together millions of people, businesses and leaders from around the world to shine a spotlight on the urgent need to address nature loss and climate change. Earth Hour is WWF's flagship global environmental movement.

---||Kochi||Kerala HC seeks EC’s views on Rajya Sabha polls||KOCHI: The Kerala High Court has asked the Election Commission of India to respond to a petition filed by the Kerala Legislative Assembly secretary seeking a directive to conduct elections to three Rajya Sabha seats falling vacant on April 21 during the term of the current legislative assembly. Justice PV Asha asked the election commission to respond after considering the petition filed through advocate V Manu. Out of the 9 seats, the terms of Vayalar Ravi, KK Ragesh, and PV Abdul Wahab are due to expire on April 21. On March 17, the election commission announced that the election to the seats will be held on April 12. But on March 24, the commission announced that the election is put on hold pending examination of the reference received from the Ministry of Law and Justice. The petition said the agency that is entrusted with the task of holding elections to the legislatures should be fully insulated so that it can function as an independent agency free from external pressures from the executive of the day. While discharging its duties, the election commission has to act on its own and should not be amenable to the control of any other body, it is contended. In the petition, it is alleged, “The act of the Election Commission in keeping in abeyance the proceedings of elections to the Council of States amounts to the subservience of the Commission to the Union Executive in violation of its independence, which independence and insulation from executive interference are mandated by the Constitution.” Apart from the impropriety, it is impermissible for the election commission to delay the discharge of its essential constitutional mandate of conducting the elections on time, at the instance of the ministry, the petition said. Such a move breaches the requirement of transparency in the functioning of the constitutional body, the petitioner has contended.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-seeks-ecs-views-on-rs-polls/articleshow/81712743.cms||---

Pawar said nearly 6,500 cases were being daily registered in Pune district and the data on the public health portal reflected a 25% positivity rate, up from 9-10% last month. The positivity rate ideally should be below 5%.

The judge was dealing with a contempt petition filed by G Nagaiah of Vemulaghat area in Siddipet district who brought to the notice of the court about the violations of an interim order. He challenged his dispossession from his land and house by the authorities while acquiring land for Mallanna Sagar reservoir that was part of Kaleshwaram Lift Irrigation Project. “First, pay costs of Rs 5,000 and then file a counter. It is a matter of shame that you (officials) deprived the farmers of their rights and now seeking time to file the counter,” the judge said before adjourning the case. The dispossession was done contrary to the interim protection offered by the court. He filed a contempt case against Siddipet district collector P Venkatram Reddy and RDO Jayachandra Reddy. The court earlier directed the collector and the RDO to file counters explaining as to why they failed to implement the orders of the court. On Friday, the state counsel sought time to file the counter as the collector had gone abroad on a personal visit. The judge told him that even the joint collector could have filed the counter on behalf of the collector. He said the revenue officials in the collectorate knew how the norms were violated and injustice was done to farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/collectors-foreign-trip-no-reasonto-stop-compensation-to-ryots-hc/articleshow/81713516.cms||---

Inaugurating the roadshow of UDF candidates at Fort Maidan here, Gandhi said: “Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan is trying to push the economy like starting a car that has no fuel in it. Still, he is trying to start it but the car is not getting started because he has no plans to solve the economic crisis of the state. A financial emergency prevails in the state and the country.” He said that the BJP destroyed the economy by its currency ban and with the introduction of GST. "But when the Congress was ruling at Centre," Gandhi said, "India had the fastest-growing economy." Gandhi added that a peaceful atmosphere was needed in the country for its economy to grow. "There should be harmony, love, and respect for each other, and respect for the view of others. When there is peace in the country the economy will grow. But the BJP is trying to divide the people and make them fight each other." He said that the 'Nyay' welfare programme will be implemented in the state if UDF returned to power. Later, Rahul Gandhi also attended campaign meetings at Ponnani and Perinthalmanna in the Malappuram district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/bjp-cpm-have-no-solution-to-economic-crisis-rahul/articleshow/81712787.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Nagpur||RFO, who shot herself, was 5-month pregnant||NAGPUR: Taking a serious note of Harisal range forest officer Deepali Chavan’s (33) suicide on Thursday, the state government on Friday evening suspended Gugamal deputy conservator of forests (DyCF) Vinod Shivkumar who was dramatically arrested at Nagpur railway station in the morning. Also, MS Reddy has been shunted out as field director & APCCF of Melghat Tiger Reserve (MTR), which falls in Amravati district, with immediate effect. Chavan had shot self with her service revolver. A postmortem conducted at Irwin General Hospital in Amravati on Friday revealed that she was five months pregnant. In her suicide note, Chavan had accused Shivkumar of harassment. Shivkumar was picked up by Amravati rural police when he was about to board the Rajdhani Express to Bengaluru. Forest sources said an hour after Chavan’s suicide, Shivkumar drove to Paratwada, kept his car there and headed for Nagpur railway station in a taxi. Chavan had also mentioned in her note addressed to Reddy that she had suffered a miscarriage earlier due to harassment by Shivkumar. Chavan wrote that she different experiences working with the Shivkumar as an IFS probationer in Dharni four years ago, where she was posted as RFO, and the DyCF in Gugamal. In Gugamal, Shivkumar would use insulting and filthy language while talking to Chavan in the presence of junior staff and villagers, she claimed. “He used to threaten me with suspension and issued show-cause notices for petty things,” wrote aid Chavan. Shivkumar tried to take advantage of me “by calling me to the eco-tourism complex”. “When I didn’t bow to his demands, he started harassing me even more,” Chavan stated. “In March 2020, when my team and I were removing encroachments in Mangia village, some villagers locked us and threatened to file atrocity cases. When I called Shivkumar, he abused me, termed me a liar said that he would tell the SP to file an atrocity case against me. I had shared this video clip with MP Navneet Rana. “Once I was forced by Shivkumar and an ACF to travel in a vehicle on a kachha road in Malur which resulted in a miscarriage. This was because I had failed to join an official tour of Melghat field director at Aamzari in October 2020, as I was not well. He did not release money for various works done in my range,” Chavan stated. Chavan’s suicide note solely held Shivkumar responsible for her death for mental, physical, and economic harassment. The note also appealed to Reddy to release her stalled salary and all other monetary service benefits to her mother who will be all alone after her death. Chavan’s husband Rajesh Mohite and mother, on Friday, demanded action against both Reddy and Shivkumar. Social organizations and local leaders did not allow the post mortem to be performed till evening as they wanted Reddy to be made a co-accused. “Only after police promised to include field director’s name as co-accused the post-mortem was allowed,” said sources. The shaken MVA government acted swiftly as the issue snowballed into political turmoil. Amravati guardian minister Yashomati Thakur, leader of opposition in council Pravin Darekar and Rana had urged CM Uddhav Thackeray to take immediate action against Shivkumar and Reddy. Mohan Karemore of All India Hindu Mahasabha too demanded action. “Chavan was literally tortured. I’ve asked all the divisional commissioners in the state to activate the Vishakha committees in 15 days,” said Thakur said. “The incident should be probed by special investigation team under a senior IPS officer. It is a big blot on the forest department that a pregnant officer had to suffer due to the highhandedness of forest officers. No steps were taken by the seniors to stop this harassment,” said Darekar. The charge of Shivkumar has been handed over to DyCF Avinash Kumar, who is in-charge of Sipna division in MTR. Reddy has been posted at the PCCF office in Nagpur where he will work until his next posting. His charge has been handed over to Amravati CCF Pravin Chavan. Forest union leaders too met head of forest force G Saiprakash and PCCF (wildlife) Nitin Kakodkar in Amravati and demanded suspension of both. The two top officials had rushed to Amravati on Friday. All the forest union leaders in respective circles in the state submitted memorandums demanding action against the two officials. Amravati SP Hari Balaji said, “We will not spare anyone involved in the suicide case. We will send the specimen of Chavan’s handwriting for confirmation and also her service pistol for a ballistic test.” Balaji added that Chavan’s relatives wanted action against other seniors too. “But they relented and co-operated with the police. It's also learned that Chavan’s husband Rajesh Mohite had initially written a complaint against Reddy but later decided to withdraw it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rfo-who-shot-herself-was-5-month-pregnant/articleshow/81713636.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

Physical classes are still not on the cards for all school students due to the pandemic. Classes have been resumed only for students of Class IX to XII. As the Goa Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education public exam will conclude on June 6, the DoE is considering starting the new academic year soon after, from June 10. Students of lower classes, from Classes I to VIII and Class IX, will see their final exams for the current academic year end before April 24. Results will be declared soon after. Students of government and government-aided schools will proceed on summer break from April 30. Teachers, however, are not agreeable to DoE’s plans to start the new academic year from June 10. The All Goa Secondary School Teachers’ Association has already officially requested the directorate to defer reopening to around June 25. Teachers have said that while students will get the prescribed six weeks of summer vacation from April end upto the second week of June, teachers, especially those involved in the Class X and XII public exam work, will be left with no summer break at all. “As per Rule 21(2)(V) of Goa Education Rule, 1986, at the end of the second term, there must be a summer vacation of six weeks. Since teachers are vocational staff, they do not get the benefit of sick leave and so teachers are entitled for the proper vacation period,” a teacher said. Due to the pandemic delaying the previous academic year, teachers had to work through May 2020 and later Christmas and Diwali vacations were curtailed last year to make up for lost academic days, teachers said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/edu-dept-looks-to-start-new-academic-year-on-june-10/articleshow/81715306.cms||---

The accused has been identified as Mungtu Ram. Interestingly, the rape case was filed on January 21, 2020 under relevant sections of the SC and ST Act.

However, the team could not arrive at a consensus and, therefore, representatives of Goa and Maharashtra have decided to submit report of their findings of the inspection at the Kalasa site at Kankumbi on March 19 independently to the Supreme Court. The superintending engineers Krishnoji Rao of Karnataka, MK Prasad of Goa and Vijaykumar Thorat of Maharashtra had held an inspection at the confluence of Kalasa and Parvad nallahs, the cross regulator and opening of the three conduits meeting the Malprabha river on March 19. However, post the inspection, Karnataka going outside the mandate given to the joint team by the SC, held a presentation for the three members, where it tried to impress upon the team that Karnataka had not carried out any violations. It was countering Goa’s claim before the SC that Karnataka is diverting the Kalasa nallah water into the Malprabha basin. Following the presentation on March 19, the discussion between Rao, Prasad and Thorat continued till late evening. It was therefore decided to meet again on March 26 to finalise the report on the team’s findings. Despite its tactics to influence the joint monitoring team in its favour, Karnataka could not provide satisfactory replies and evidences to the queries raised by Goa and Maharashtra representatives on the team. The superintending engineers of Goa and Maharashtra refused to sign the report as a result and have decided to submit their reports independently to the apex court. On Friday, Prasad along with assistant engineer of Goa WRD Dilip Naik was present at the meeting, whereas Maharashtra was represented solely by Thorat. But yet again Karnataka brought in more than a dozen officials of its WRD, besides Rao, to the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mhadei-goa-maha-to-submit-report-independently-before-sc/articleshow/81715327.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar
---||Pune||1971 war veteran Lt Gen WAG Pinto passes away||Pune: Lt Gen Walter Anthony Gustavo (WAG) Pinto (retd), who fought in the World War II and was known for his role in the famous battle of Basantar during the 1971 Indo-Pak war, passed away on Thursday of old age at the Southern Command hospital in Wanowrie. He was 96 and is survived by two sons and four grandchildren. His last rites will be performed with full military honours on Sunday in Pune. The location is yet to be decided, his granddaughter Andrea said. He retired as Central Army Commander in June 1982 and settled down in Pune. After completing the six-month emergency commission training course at the Indian Military Academy, Dehradun, he was commissioned into the 13th Frontier Force Rifles of the British Army in 1943. The then Second Lieutenant Pinto was posted to the Machine Gun battalion. In 1949, the Indian Army raised the Brigade of the Guards. Pinto was selected for the 3rd battalion of the Guards and he took over as a Company commander in 1950. In the 1971 India-Pakistan war, the then Major General Pinto commanded the 54 Infantry division in Western theatre. His division captured several crucial outposts of the enemy nation during the war. “The country will remember him as the General who led the Infantry to victory in the 1971 Indo-Pak War. But to me, his victories on the battlefield played a small part in the man I will always remember. The grandfather I knew was the one sitting in his armchair by the television with a beret on his head and his faithful dachshund by his side, absorbing every bit of the news he could. During the lockdown, I took up baking and I would get him freshly baked cakes and cookies. He claimed to enjoy everything I baked,” Andrea said. Lt Gen BT Pandit (retd), who fought under his leadership in the war, told TOI on Friday, “He was my role model and would remain so forever. He would always be remembered for his competitiveness and jovial nature. During the war, he was there on the battlefield with a small group. He motivated us in his unique way.” After retirement, he had penned a book titled ‘Bash on Regardless’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/1971-war-veteran-lt-gen-wag-pinto-passes-away/articleshow/81713522.cms||Sandip Dighe

Patnekar initially adjourned the House for 10 minutes after some of the opposition members rushed into the well of the House, but with the opposition refusing to let the House continue with its business, Patnekar was forced to adjourn the House for a longer duration. The opposition subsequently submitted a letter to the speaker calling for a one hour discussion on the sugar factory. Earlier, the opposition MLAs grilled the government over the closure of Goa’s lone sugarcane crushing factory at Dharbandora and the delay in conducting the techno-feasibility for its upgradation. The opposition also blamed the government for the failure to disburse funds to the sugarcane growers. The issue led to a war of words between chief minister Pramod Sawant and the opposition. Ponda MLA Ramakrishna Dhavalikar said that Patnekar’s refusal to permit a discussion and the state government’s unwillingness to clarify doubts of farmers amounted to a “mockery of democracy.” Opposition leader Digambar Kamat demanded that the state government should upgrade the factory in a “time-bound manner” instead of letting the issue drag on for months. The debate began after Goa Forward Party MLA Vinoda Paliencar asked agriculture minister Chandrakant Kavlekar whether the factory will be repaired soon and if there is any proposal to upgrade the sugar factory to improve its functioning. Opposition MLAs alleged that the state government was playing with the farmers lives and livelihoods by delaying the factory’s revival and the compensation owed to the farmers. However, Sawant said that there was no concensus among the sugarcane farmers about the rate offered by the government for the crop. Palienkar and Sardesai also questioned the basis on which Deccan Sugar Technologies Pvt Ltd was brought in by the government as a consultant for the sugar factory.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/stormy-scenes-over-sugar-factorys-closure-house-adjourned-twice/articleshow/81715331.cms||---

The accused, Rajesh Jatav, 30, a father of three daughters, in a bid to hide the body threw stones in the well on the same evening. The court has sent him on a remand for three days on Friday. A native of Hinduan village under the Nadbhai Police station, the accused Jatav abducted the girl while she was on her way to buy some household items on March 24 evening. “He took the girl to a secluded place where he raped her and strangulated her to death which was confirmed by the doctors who had conducted the post-mortem. The accused thereafter dumped the body in the well behind an oil mill the same night,” said Bharatpur rural CO Hariram Meena. Police were astonished to learn that the accused had thrown stones in the well to hide the body. Acting on the missing complaint filed on March 24, police scanned all CCTV cameras in the area and found the girl being taken by the accused near an oil mill area in the village. Police formed several teams to search the entire area, but found nothing beyond the CCTV footage. “Some locals saw the body floating in the well the next day and informed police, which had identified the body of the missing girl. The NDRF team retrieved the body late on Thursday,” said Meena. The medical examination of the body further shocked the police. The victim’s feet were broken, internal parts had injury marks and the head was injured. The cause of death was choking, while it appears that the body sustained severe injuries as it was thrown into the well. The victim was a student of class III.

This surprised many in the party as it is yet to take a call. Though Nivedita Reddy has reportedly appealed to the party top brass several times for a chance to contest, the party leaders feel she could only secure one per cent votes in the last election. “The situation before was different, now BJP has gained a lot of popularity and is looking to take on the TRS, there were several different opinions in the party over her candidature,” party sources said. Nivedita’s family has been involved with the BJP since long and her husband K Sridhar Reddy is BJP Nalgonda district president. When contacted, Sridhar Reddy told TOI “ Yes she has filed her nomination as today is an auspicious day and we are awaiting the party’s decision,” he said. Telangana BJP affairs in-charge Tarun Chugh was reportedly in favour of her, but many in the party wanted a strong face. Along with her’s, two other names, Ravi Naik, Anjaiah Yadav, are under consideration. Sources close to Nivedita Reddy said that she is upset that the party is considering names of members who had recently joined the party whereas she stood by the party even when the BJP had no strength. In addition to this, other leaders are also upset that no candidate is being announced till the last minute, which is leaving no time for ground work. “The idea to wait until the TRS announces the candidate may not work,” sources said. With the Congress also being strong in this segment, the party is of the view that the candidate must be very appealing. The BJP core committee, including BJP state president Bandi Sanjay Kumar, Union minister of state for home affairs G Kishan Reddy and other senior leaders are likely to hold a meeting on Saturday to finalize the candidate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bjps-nivedita-files-nomination-party-may-pick-nominee-today/articleshow/81713554.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Interestingly just to make the victims feel they were genuine officers they took a paper on which they had made of list of items they had picked from the house and get it signed by victims. Police said the house is owned by Deepak Sharma who runs a finance company at C Scheme. During the time of an incident, Sharma’s school teacher wife was in school and their daughter was also in school. “Sharma’s son Vidit was present at the house who was preparing for his examination. Vidit opened the door knocked by the robbers. They showed him ACB identity cards which were believed by Vidit and gave them entry into the house,” said the police. Vidit picked up his phone to inform his father, the robbers snatched it asked him to keep quiet since and told him that no one is allowed to make a call during a raid that has further made Vidit believed them to be real. They told him to cooperate in frisking of a house on the basis of some solid inputs. They asked him to open the almirah to check the documents. “Here they found a bag which with Rs 22 lakh cash and Rs 98,000 from other places along with they seized two hard discs,” said the police. To make the raid looked real, the robbers noted the collected and seized items and asked Vidit to sign a document that had a logo of ACB. They took 30 minutes to carry out the fake raid and exited from the house without any question. Vidit father Deepak took him to the ACB office to confirm the raid. Police were informed when the family realised, they were made a fool by the robbers. Police says that it appears that accused were aware of the cash placed in the house. The CCTV footage has been traced in which the accused were seen wearing a face mask entering the house. “The CCTV footage of previous days are also being looked at to find out the movement of any unwanted persons in the area,” said the police. The investigating agency is also looking into the insider’s role in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/robbers-pose-as-acb-sleuths-loot-rs-22l-from-financiers-house-in-city/articleshow/81714477.cms||---

The charge-sheet also pointed out the role of Gujjar’s girlfriend Jiya in providing safe heavens to the gangster and made co-accused in several criminal acts committed by him. The charge-sheet contains Papla’s bank statements in SBI, Bank of Maharashtra, HDFC and ICICI pointing out his financial records. “Papla made a frequent transaction to one person via online wallet,” reads the charge-sheet, which was not made available to the mediapersons. It also has a detailed account of his WhatsApp chat and calls details of two mobile numbers – Jio and Vodafone. The details prove the role of the gangster in several criminal cases and also build a strong case against many of his gang members. Papla absconded from police custody in September 2019 and was arrested by the special emergency team from Kolhapur on January 28, 2021. Thereafter, he has been dodging the police and had a narrow escape with them several times. During this period, several of his gang members were nabbed by the police which had weakened his criminal network. The charge-sheet also has details about where all Papla visited and took refuge during the absconding period. “The role of Papla’s friend Jiya as a co-accused with the gangster in several criminal acts done by the gangster and providing refuge to him has been proved with evidence in the charge-sheet,” said the police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/1k-page-chargesheet-filed-against-gangster-papla/articleshow/81713565.cms||---

Posing several questions to IAS officer Vikas Raj who appeared before the court in a contempt case, Justice MS Ramachandra Rao said: “Mere issuance of a GO would not amount to complying with the order of the court. It will be treated as implemented only when the money reaches the workers.” He gave the government time till April-end to implement the court order.  The judge passed orders that the workers were entitled to proper pay scales. Though 3 years have passed, the order has not been implemented till now. Vikas Raj told the court that he is not looking after the panchayat raj department now but is with the general administration department. Ramakrishna filed an affidavit saying that his department has not committed any contempt. The state counsel informed the court that a GO was issued to implement the court order and sought three months’ time to implement it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-poser-to-t-over-wages-to-sweepers/articleshow/81713578.cms||---

---||Delhi||Webinar discusses benefits of e-vehicles||New Delhi: Dialogue and Development Commission (DDC) of Delhi organised a webinar under the Switch Delhi campaign on ‘Accelerating electrification of fleets in Delhi’ in association with Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) on Friday. “Delhi’s electric vehicle policy provides the most favourable policy framework across India for commercial vehicles to transition to EVs--from financial incentives to low-interest loan financing to exemption from no-entry restrictions for plying on roads at peak hours. The Kejriwal government offers the most generous financial incentives across the range of electric vehicles that fleet companies use, making it much cheaper to run EVs as compared to CNG or petrol vehicles,” DDC vice-chairperson Jasmine Shah said. He added that it’s a huge opportunity for logistics operators, last-mile connectivity service providers and cab aggregators to make a switch to EV due to low regulatory burden and progressive EV policy in place in Delhi. He said that out of more than 7,700 EVs registered in Delhi since the launch of the EV policy in August 2020, 85% were commercial vehicles or operating fleets. “Commercial vehicles will lead the transition of Delhi to being a global EV hub,” he said.

Replying to an unstarred question in the assembly by leader of opposition Digambar Kamat, Godinho said that all 191 village panchayats have already prepared their annual gram panchayat plans and submitted them to the respective zilla panchayats. However, as the DPCs also consist of members of municipal councils, Godinho said that the planning panels will be constituted “once the municipality elections are conducted across Goa”. The DPC prepares a draft plan of the entire district after incorporating village and municipal development plans. However, over the years, absence of statistical data had hampered the planning process towards preparation of the draft district plan. Section 238 (1) of the Goa Panchayati Raj Act, 1994, mandates that every panchayat prepare a development plan every year and submit it to the respective zilla panchayat within a specified time frame. Godinho said all the gram sabha development plans have been uploaded on the e-Gram Swaraj portal, and that the newly formed zilla panchayat bodies have undertaken the task of preparation of the annual development plan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/annual-devpt-plans-after-civic-polls/articleshow/81715356.cms||---
---||Goa||State bans celebration of Holi, other festivals in public places, parks||Panaji: The state government announced on Friday that outdoor celebrations of Holi, Shab-e-Barat, Easter and Eid-ul-Fitr will not be permitted in public places, but kept silent on indoor parties in clubs, pubs and hotels. The long holiday weekend is expected to attract thousands of tourists to Goa. TOI has earlier reported about the huge spike in fares due to the high demand on the route. Even as nightclubs and other enterainment venues prepare to welcome guests, the government has issued no guidelines — not even an advisory — to these venues, most packed to capacity with maskless revellers dancing in close proximity. The directive flies in the face of the settled science on transmission. “Covid-19 spreads more easily indoors than outdoors,” says the US-based Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). “Studies show that people are more likely to be exposed to Covid-19 when they are closer than 6-ft apart from others for longer periods of time.” Friday’s order was issued a day after the state reported 189 cases of Covid-19, the highest single-day count since January. On Friday, the state reported 113 more cases, taking the active count to 1,277. The order, issued by the public health department, has directed district collectors and superintendents of police of the two districts to ensure compliance of standard operating procedure (SOPs) in place and other instructions issued by the government from time to time. Holi celebrations in many parts of the state begin on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-bans-celebration-of-holi-other-festivals-in-public-places-parks/articleshow/81715362.cms||---

---||Jaipur||High Court stays order dissolving committees in JMC Greater||JAIPUR: High court on Friday in an interim order stayed the director local bodies order on February 25 this year dissolving all the committees constituted by the municipal corporation Jaipur Greater. The single bench of Justice Ashok Kumar Gaur issued the order on a petition by mayor Saumya Gurjar and others. The state government argued that the corporation nominated some non-elected ineligible members in the committees, for which the court asked how all the members could be ineligible and all committees could be dissolved. Ashish Sharma, counsel for the petitioner, said the first general meeting of the board of the corporation held on January 28 this year. In the meeting, out of 150 elected members, 149 were present. The meeting passed resolutions by a majority of 88 members on the formation of the executive committee and other 20 mandatory committees under section 55 and 56 of the Municipalities Act. Additionally, a resolution seeking approval of the state government for seven more committees was passed. He said the commissioner prepared a dissent note with regard to the proposed seven new committees and forwarded it to the government on February 1 in violation of section 49 of the Act. He said if the commissioner had any disagreement with the decision of the meeting he should have expressed it at the meeting itself. The state government acting on the dissent note dissolved all the 27 committees invoking section 49(4) of the Act. The petitioner said the action of the state government was illegal and arbitrary. The petition said the government acted without even giving a hearing to the petitioners. The petition said the functions of the corporation are carried out through the various mandatory committees and the government action tantamount to usurping the powers of the elected local body.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/hc-stays-order-dissolving-committees-in-jmc-greater/articleshow/81713592.cms||Joychen Joseph
---||Mumbai||‘And one man in his life plays many parts’||There’s nothing like death to remind us how larger than life some people were. The dimunitive Anil Dharker certainly was, as confirmed by the shocked messages that yesterday jammed the WhatsApps of all who knew him. They were as diverse as they were legion. For, Anil straddled many worlds. Least of all the one for which he was professionally trained: engineering. Instead, he rose to the multiple peaks of media. Editor and columnist. He was telegenic with his articulate grasp of many matters, and no less his maestro locks. He had more than the dilettante’s knowledge of the arts especially music, as borne out by his close association with the NCPA—and his deep-drill interview with Zubin Mehta. He briefly headed the National Film Development Corporation. Additionally, Tata’s R Gopalkrishnan mourned the loss of his tennis partner of 30 years. Anil was a single malt aficionado; briefly even launched his signature line of long kurtas. And he was a fully paid-up member of Mumbai’s salon society. All these coalesced in what Anil Dharker came to be known best for: Tata Litlive. He put everything he had into forging it into a tour de force—and ultimately it drained life out of him. The heart is a ruthless mistress. Litfests also took a toll of our near 50-year-friendship. Anil was convinced that I was responsible for the Times of India pulling out of Litlive and starting its own litfest with me at the helm. I had no such clout, and even less inclination. I was a reluctant stopgap, who ultimately didn’t stop. But I do hope that my valued friend hasn’t carried this baseless grudge to his grave. It would deepen my sorrow over his loss. For, I have known Anil over ‘mornings, evenings, afternoons’. I remember when the Dharkers flashed into the Bombay orbit in the early ’70s. Khushwant Singh, my first boss, wrote about them in the Illustrated Weekly, totally taken up by this beautiful couple fresh from London. For him, it had the edgy cachet of being an Indo-Pak marriage, though in truth Imtiaz was Glasgow-raised. Anil suave; she, the sensitive poet and artist—they seamlessly merged into that galaxy of advertising/theatre wallas, literary enfants terribles, editors bound by liberal thought and urban consciousness. The Dharkers’ parties were coveted for the quality of their conversations—and Imtiaz’s roast lamb with rosemary potatoes. Their daughter Ayesha would craft her own artistic success as a stage actor in London, and the doting Anil always said only half in jest, that he was the least talented of the family. But fate is no respecter of charmed lives. The Dharkers parted ways. Amy, who too had been my friend (and colleague) for almost as long, came into Anil’s life. Theirs has been a great mutual devotion. Imtiaz is happily ensconced amidst London’s cultural haute monde; she refused poet laureate-ship because she wanted to retain her creative independence. Ours is not to question why relationships realign. We can only try not to let any twists turn the screws on friendships and loyalties. Rest assured, dear Anil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/and-one-man-in-his-life-plays-many-parts/articleshow/81716293.cms||Bachi Karkaria

Dismissing allegations that state’s borrowings have been rising, the CM said during a debate on the budget on Friday that Telangana stands 25th among states which took the highest borrowings in the country. Replying on the appropriation bill, KCR said the Centre and even Reserve Bank of India have gone on record to say that Telangana has been maintaining fiscal discipline. “Wealth of the people in the state has improved. Thanks to augmentation of irrigation facilities, the agriculture produce cost in the state has touched Rs 1 lakh crore,” he said. While the previous Congress and TDP governments had spent Rs 54,000 crore on capital expenditure in the past six decades when the state was united, the TRS government has spent Rs 2.34 lakh crore in the past six years. “As a result of this, the state GSDP is also on the rise,” KCR claimed. Though the state had sufferred Rs 1 lakh crore due to lockdown and the pandemic, the government did not stop welfare measures, he said. He also announced that junior panchayat secretaries would get full salaries from the next month. He said the government would take a decision on unemployment allowance soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ts-borrowings-well-within-frbm-limits-cm/articleshow/81713620.cms||---

From bad handwriting to incorrect contact information, these staffers find themselves sifting through a trove of perplexing paperwork before they can send test results to the arriving passengers. At the same time, they field calls from irate flyers demanding an explanation for why their test result was not delivered. “Bad handwriting and incorrect email addresses cause a lot of hassles — till February, around 1,800 passengers arrived in Pune per day from these five states. While the number has since gone down, the problems have not. The same passengers later call us, demanding to know why they have not received their RT-PCR reports,” an official with the on-site diagnostic centre deputed by the Pune airport authorities said. It is mandatory for those flying in from these five states to carry negative RT-PCR reports. If they don’t have the report, they are tested on arrival and allowed to leave. “Before the sample is collected, each flyer must fill up a self-declaration form with name, address, mobile number, e-mail address, flight number and seat number. We need to submit this data — key to tracing these passengers — to Pune Municipal Corporation,” the official added. The official said they have now taken to instructing the flyers to write down their information in block letters. “While 90% of the arrivals carry a report, even 10% if a big number, especially when most give incorrect email addresses or their handwriting in illegible,” the official said. On the positivity rate among those tested at the airport, he said there was only a slight increase compared to the past two months. On Friday, TOI had reported complaints from some flyers that the officials at the Pune airport were not properly checking the RT-PCR test reports on arrival.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/illegible-scrawls-incorrect-details-hamper-screening-effort-at-airport/articleshow/81713602.cms||Joy Sengupta

Worryingly, the real-time data available on the state forest department’s website also shows that of the total number of fires recorded, 14,088 alerts falling inside the forest areas caused enormous damage to the environment and habitats of several species that depend on these forests. “We have seen forest fires in this region before, but this year is different. We have never seen the forest fires at this rate before,” said Edla Kishore, a resident of Mannanur village near Amrabad tiger reserve. Meanwhile, Jannaram mandal in Mancherial district is also recording continuous forest fires since the start of the season, sources said. On the other hand, forest officials of Kumaram Bheem Asifabad district said that sporadic fires are seen in the region for the past few weeks are driving wild animals out of the forest areas. Explaining the reason behind the highest number of forest fires recorded in the region, Mulugu District Forest Officer (DFO) Pradeep Kumar Shetty said, “It came to our notice that some of the fires were being willfully caused by beedi leaf contractors to induce new growth. We have also issued notices to these contractors and are taking measures to minimize incidents of wildfires. Most of these fires are deliberate and lit by people living in the vicinity for inducing growth of grass for animal grazing or for crop rotation.” Speaking about the rise in forest fires, the DFO said, “We usually have more number of fire points but the area damaged due to the fires will be less.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-records-over-15k-forest-fires-since-start-of-summer-this-yr/articleshow/81713604.cms||Moulika.KV

In a calling attention, Porvorim MLA Rohan Khaunte said, “The Atal Setu was inaugurated two years ago, in January 2019. However it is still undergoing progress/repairs till date.” Even as the arm connecting to Panaji remains incomplete, on the Panaji side, the gap between the bridge and ramp has widened, which now is even being noticed by the common man, and the bridge is constantly being repaired for potholes, he said. “The potholes have sharp ridges and are deep and can lead to accidents and vehicular damage. L & T should be held responsible for mismanagement and responsibility should be fixed,” Khaunte said. Questioning the steps the government proposed to take in this regard, Khaunte said there is “apprehension and anxiety in the minds of the people due to the incomplete works” relating to the third Mandovi bridge. The number of accidents recorded on the bridge alone are strikingly high and require urgent attention, Khaunte said. Sawant said that the “total bridge will be completed by December 21”. About the accidents, he said that there is 50kmph speed restriction on the bridge despite which speed which is resulting in accidents. He also said that the state government will ask L&T to hotmix the bridge again and that there is a five year defect liability from the date of completion of the project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/atal-setu-to-be-completed-by-december-cm-tells-house/articleshow/81715377.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Now, Babush tests positive for Covid||PANAJI: Days after a maskless Panaji MLA Atanasio Monserrate took to the streets of the capital to celebrate his panel’s victory in the Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) polls, he tested positive for Covid-19 on Friday. Monserrate, who has chosen to be home-isolated, has appealed to those who came in contact with him to get tested immediately. This includes the newly-elected CCP corporators and also legislators, since the assembly was in session. In the aftermath of his poll victory, Monserrate was pictured greeting and hugging his supporters on the streets of Panaji, with very few wearing masks, and none observing physical distancing. The capital has seen a speedy rise in Covid-19 infections over the past ten days, and has the highest (155) caseload as on Friday. Municipal polls, including election to the CCP, were held on March 20. Monserrate met the newly-elected corporators of the BJP-supported panel at a city hotel two days ago, a source said. “We were about 35, including the newly-elected corporators,” said one of them who was present at the meeting.  He said that the members would now have to undergo Covid-19 tests, and that the election of the mayor, which is slated for Tuesday, may have to be deferred if corporators test positive. On Friday, Goa reported 113 new cases of Covid-19, 111 recoveries and one death, that pushed the tally of active cases to 1,279. The case positivity rate was 5.3% with 2,123 swab tests done, and the recovery rate stands at 96.3%. A health official said that besides Panaji and Margao, they are concerned about a steady rise in new infections in Candolim, Vasco, Cortalim, Cansaulim and Ponda over the past few days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/now-babush-tests-positive-for-covid/articleshow/81715368.cms||---

In what could be termed a customary demonstration, some farmers led by Congress leaders blocked three highways of the city on the outskirts as a token of protest. These farmers and leaders assembled at Nagaur Road, Barmer Road and Jaipur Road in the morning and blocked the roads for some time shouting slogans against the three new farm laws and PM Narendra Modi demanding withdrawal of all the laws. Though, traffic on these three highways remained affected for some time, there was no major impact of the bandh call in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/strike-fails-to-make-impact-in-jodhpur/articleshow/81714496.cms||---

Finance minister T Harish Rao, replying during question hour in the assembly on Friday, said chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao’s decision to link the projects would also help in extending drinking water to several municipalities and villages under Jurala. The PRLIS will provide water to 12.30 lakh acres in 19 constituencies of erstwhile Mahabubnagar and Rangareddy districts. It will also serve the drinking water needs of villages and industries by lifting two TMC per day for 60 days during flood season from the foreshores of Srisailam reservoir between Yellur village and KP Laxmidevipally. It is going to be a five-stage pumping followed by gravity before it reaches the parched lands. Works on the project are going on at a brisk pace and targets have been set to complete the works at Uddandapur by December 2021. Earlier, TRS MLAs, mainly from the assembly constituencies located in and around erstwhile Mahbubnagar district, urged the government to complete PRLIS on a war footing on the lines of Kaleshwaram project. “Mahbubnagar district had earlier become unpopular for people migrating from the district to other places. The CM has redesigned projects to irrigate every acre and transform the district into a green area,” said Harish Rao. The previous governments could not complete the projects but the TRS government has almost completed Kalwakurthy, Nettempadu, Koilsagar and Bhima irrigation projects and gave water to the farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/palamuru-lift-project-to-be-linked-to-kalwakurthy-jurala/articleshow/81713623.cms||Roushan Ali

Around 50 members of Association of Transgender/Hijra in Bengal (ATHB) are lined up to be recruited by the e-commerce majors. Ranjita Sinha, secretary, ATHB, told TOI on Friday, “We worked really hard, to liaison with these companies. And now the MoU is going to be signed. We are trying to get opportunities for at least 50 of our members.” Sinha added, “The trans and LGBTQ+ community suffered the most in this pandemic, facing discrimination and torture like never before.Many of them were homeless during lockdown. We raised funds, supported them but long-term solution is needed. Since corporate houses are promoting inclusiveness, we tried to seize the opportunity,” said Sinha who herself has transitioned from a man. The Mahindra Group is entrusted to recruit for both Amazon and Flipkart. “For the new financial year, we have plans to recruit from ATHB. This will be followed by a 90-day programme for feedback on the issues these recruits may be facing. We have to ensure the transgender individuals receive the same equitable treatment accorded to all employees,” said Mahindra deputy manager, HR, Ajay Chaudhury.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/inclusive-move-e-tail-giants-to-recruit-trans-people-in-city/articleshow/81713630.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty
---||Mumbai||100% green energy option at 66 paise extra for a unit in Mumbai||Mumbai: In a first, power users in the state have the option to go for 100% renewable energy supply by paying an extra 66 paise a unit for ‘green power tariff’ which was approved by MERC this week. MERC’s order said all users (extra high voltage, high voltage and low voltage) will be eligible to opt for 100% renewable energy (RE). A power company official said even low-tension residential users can opt for green energy at extra cost. The order will be applicable to Tata Power, Adani Electricity, BEST and MSEDCL supply areas, the official said. “Green Power Tariff being totally voluntary in nature will give choice to consumers to opt for green energy. The extra charge to procure RE being charged from specific consumers would not increase the cost to be borne by other consumers who are obtaining from thermal sources,” the order said. The distribution licensee will have to enter into a separate contract to buy RE specifically to meet the energy requirement of such users and issue a certificate to such consumers. A Tata Power official said: “Some corporate consumers have approached Tata Power to become ‘zero carbon company’ and meet their requirement of 100% green energy.” In its prayer before the commission prior to the order, Tata Power said: “Over 175 of the world’s most influential companies have already made this commitment through the global corporate leadership initiative, RE100.” MERC’s order signed by commission members Mukesh Khullar and I M Bohari said: “Such an option will also help increase awareness among consumers about use of renewable energy and support goal of integrating renewable energy.” MSEDCL submitted that the scheme shall be limited to high-tension users (HT) in industrial and commercial category while BEST said it will be restricted to HT users. Tata Power said it “got a requisition from 15 users and approached MERC to determine Green Power Tariff”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/100-green-energy-option-at-66-paise-extra-for-a-unit-in-mumbai/articleshow/81714513.cms||Somit Sen
---||Lucknow||‘Success of Lucknow & Noida behind new commissionerates’||Lucknow: Calling police commissionerates at Noida and Lucknow a success, UP DGP HC Awasthy said that the exemplary experience at these places was behind the decision to implement the police commissionerate system in Kanpur Nagar and Varanasi. Awasthy said that Noida’s police commissionerate led to creation of a conducive environment for investors, while in Lucknow, police presence at every crossing at any point of time made people feel safer. “Investors and companies now don’t want to go to Faridabad, Gurgaon, but they feel secure and safe in Noida. This change in perception has been brought out by the commissionerate system of policing,” he stressed. Likewise, in Lucknow there used to be long snarls on roads but now you can drive and feel the difference. “If we also do a comparison in the rate of crime in both Noida and Lucknow commissionerates, we will find a drastic reduction in rate," added the officer. Further elaborating on the commissionerate, the DGP said that Varanasi was evolving as a cultural hub so policing also needs to be evolved. Kanpur has been the industrial district of the state and its policing needed a fresh approach. Hence, these two cities were selected for commissionerates, he added. Replying to a question why powers of excise, arms licence has not been integrated in the commissionerates, unlike other cities in India, the DGP replied that commissionerate is an evolving system of policing. "The commissionerate of a city like Delhi is almost 50 years old now hence they have such a system in place. For a system to be analysed accurately, effectively we need at least 3-4 years,” he said. The ultimate objective of having commissionerate is providing security, safety to the common people and changing their perception towards the police. The DGP also said that as per the provisions in the law, all those districts which have a population of over 10 lakh are to be made a commissionerate but then the final nod vests with the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/success-of-lucknow-noida-behind-new-commissionerates/articleshow/81715383.cms||---

The blood-stained body of a 40-year-old man, identified as Premnarayan Meena, was on Friday morning recovered from his house at Akhakhedi village under Chipabarode police station, said DSP and CO, Chabda Omendra Singh Shekhawat. The deceased was a government teacher in a school in Faithagarh in Madhya Pradesh. Police initiated investigation and found that the deceased teacher’s wife Rukmani (40) and a worker hired to work in their agriculture field, Jitendra Bairwa (32) of Paroli village, had illicit relations and the deceased had become a ‘hurdle’ in their relationship, he said. Thus, wife and her paramour conspired to kill the teacher and sought aid of one Hansraj Bheel (40) for Rs 20,000, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/wife-lover-aide-held-for-murder-of-govt-teacher/articleshow/81714498.cms||---

---||Goa||Will consider all suggestions before finalising CZMP plan: Goa CM Pramod Sawant||PORVORIM: Chief minister Pramod Sawant told the House on Friday that the coastal zone management plan (CZMP) would not be finalised till plans submitted by village panchayats and 4,000 other suggestions received from citizens are considered. “The plans given by the panchayats will be tallied with the plan drafted by the national centre for sustainable coastal management (NCSCM), Chennai, as also 4,000 suggestions will be taken into consideration before the CZMP is finalised,” Sawant said. He appealed to Porvorim MLA Rohan Khaunte to withdraw his private member’s resolution. Khaunte, through the resolution, recommended that CZMP be reverted to the panchayat level, where the voice of the concerned Goan can be heard. The House witnessed a heated discussion on the issue for over an over hour and a half. In case the plan submitted by any panchayat is not correct, Sawant said it would be brought to the notice of the concerned panchayat. It will be asked to submit a corrected plan, and only then will it be finalised. The chief minister repeated his statement, trying to dissipate fears of the opposition that the new CZMP would bulldoze coastal villages. He also told the House that a committee comprising fishermen headed by the fisheries director has been constituted. Fishermen can address their queries and doubts to the committee through the panchayat and get them cleared, he said. Earlier, attempts by environment minister Nilesh Cabral to explain the works undertaken by his ministry to reach out to the people over this plan failed to convince the opposition. “Why is the government not consulting the people properly, and trying to rush with the plan? Why can’t the government go back to the panchayats and decide on the plan?” asked Curtorim MLA Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco. The common man gets notices along the coastal belt for CRZ violations, but the big projects, including hotels and others, are not touched for irregularities, he said, pointing out that the apprehension among the people is due to the injustice being done to the communities. Khaunte demanded to know why port limits are shown in CZMP. But Cabral refused to revert the draft CZMP to village panchayats, stating that the panchayats were given hard copies of CZMP. Last year, he had meetings at taluka level to understand the concerns of the people, but except for three talukas, the response was not very encouraging, he said. Despite the assurance from the chief minister, Khaunte refused to withdraw his resolution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/will-consider-all-suggestions-before-finalising-czmp-plan-cm/articleshow/81715393.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Union minister should first give voice samples: Congress||JAIPUR: PCC chief and school education minister Govind Singh Dotasra once again rubbished allegations of phone-tapping against the Ashok Gehlot-government after reports surfaced on social media on Friday that Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat has lodged a complaint in the matter with the Delhi police. Dotasra said Shekhawat should stop the gimmick and give his voice samples to Rajasthan police that has proof of the latter's involvement in the alleged conspiracy to topple an elected government. Congress chief whip Mahesh Joshi said Shekhawat lodging an FIR was an admission that the voice in the viral audio clips was his (Shekhawat’s). “What new has emerged that made Shekhawat to file a police complaint eight months later? The CM had cleared it in the assembly on August 14 last year that phones of none of the public representatives were tapped. We told the same in the assembly this month too. The FIR now in Delhi is a proof that the conspiracy to topple our elected government was, and still is, being hatched at the Centre,” Dotasra said at a press conference here. The PCC chief added, “These people somehow want to drag in central agencies like CBI or NIA to pressurise our government and prevent us from functioning, but we will not be intimated.” Chief minister Gehlot’s officer on special duty (OSD) Lokesh Sharma, who is prime accused in the FIR, told TOI, “In my statement to Rajasthan SOG, I had said that the audio clips were circulating on social media and from there I too received the same. Since my job as OSD for communication is to share information with the media, I forwarded the clips to reporters. Why should have I hidden these, especially when a conspiracy was on to topple the elected government. In the public interest, it was important to give maximum publicity to the clips.” Sharma added, “The charges related to tapping are baseless.” The FIR by union minister Shekhawat cites parliamentary affairs minister Shanti Dhariwal admitting in the assembly on March 17 that Sharma had circulated the audio clips to the media. Dotasra said, “We had requested for a voice sample from Shekhawat when the charges were first levelled against him and the Raj police even went to his Delhi residence to collect the same but he then hid like a rat does on seeing a cat. Shekhawat now claims that the state police have already filed FR in the case here, but he should know that cases can be reopened when there is fresh evidence.” Reacting to Dotasra’s statement, BJP state spokesperson Ramlal Sharma said the ruling Congress should collect voice samples of its own MLAs accused of conspiring to topple the government. "Dragging the name of Shekhawat is a politically motivated attempt to dent the union minister’s image.” The BJP leader added, “The confession about phone tapping in the assembly has made it clear that the government used unlawful means to tape phones of MLAs and MPs. It is now time to face the inquiry.” In another development a day earlier, the Centre approved the 'appointment on deputation' as additional secretary, ministry of culture, of senior IAS officer Rohit Kumar Singh, who was additional chief secretary (ACS) of the state home department during the political crisis when the phone tapping controversy emerged. Singh was ACS for the medical and health department at the peak of the pandemic last year and Gehlot had praised his efficient management of corona. He was, however, moved out from his next posting as ACS for home in less than two months, much to the bewilderment of many in the administrative, political and social circles. Singh was ACS home from July 3, 2020 to August 20, 2020, while the political crisis in the Gehlot government was from July 10, 2020 to August 14, 2020. Soon after being moved from the home department to the rural development and panchayati raj department, Singh had applied for deputation at the Centre. He earlier served on central deputation as joint secretary, ministry of road transport and highways, from April 2012 to May 2018. Late in the night, Shekhawat tweeted, “Violation of privacy is considered a crime as per the law, but the Congress is referring to the police complaint against this crime as a conspiracy. Where do these Congressmen get such audacity from?||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/union-min-should-first-give-voice-samples-cong/articleshow/81714500.cms||---
---||Mumbai||DNA not a match, but paanwallah gets 10 years for rape of mentally ill woman||MUMBAI: A 50-year-old paan shop-owner from Andheri was convicted by the Dindoshi sessions court to 10 years in prison for rape of a woman with a mental health condition. The judgment was given in the 37-year-old victim’s favour despite a DNA sample of her aborted foetus not matching with that of the accused, Vinod Mishra. The court observed that she could not have been capable of giving consent as she was suffering from “moderate mental retardation and had an IQ of 47”. The judge considered that while Mishra pleaded innocence in court, he had admitted before two people earlier that he had sexual relations with the woman. The woman lived with her widowed brother and his children. On July 17, 2015, she complained of stomach pain and was taken to a doctor, who said she was pregnant. Her brother asked her if she had physical relations with anyone. Two days later, she took Mishra before her brother. Mishra admitted to her brother that they had sexual relations for four months, and he was willing to marry the victim. The brother was taken aback and contacted her doctor on July 20. When the doctor confirmed she was two months pregnant, her brother approached MIDC police. Mishra’s lawyer argued that besides DNA samples not matching, the prosecutor seemed “confused” about the victim’s mental retardation. He argued that the victim had wrongly identified Mishra as ‘Pavan’. The court noted that when the victim was taken to Cooper Hospital for examination, a gynaecologist observed mild retardation and referred her to the psychiatry department. A medical certificate from the hospital stated she was suffering from moderate mental retardation and had an IQ of 47. Her brother said she had mental disability since childhood and had been taken to doctors. “It’s a settled principle of law that a person with mental disability cannot give consent,” said additional sessions judge H C Shende. As far as the negative DNA report was concerned, the court said DNA was only corroborative evidence. “DNA evidence is only as reliable as the procedure used to test. Even if a DNA test is negative, it cannot be said that no offence is committed,” said Shende. The victim initially gave the accused’s name as ‘Pavan’ but pointed at Mishra in court. While Mishra’s lawyer argued that the FIR was an “afterthought”, the judge noted it was natural for the victim’s brother to talk to her doctor about her pregnancy before lodging a police complaint. The court ordered Mishra to pay the victim a compensation of Rs20,000, said additional public prosecutor Geeta Malankar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-dna-does-not-match-but-10-yrs-for-paanwallah-for-rape/articleshow/81714517.cms||Nitasha Natu
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Hospital safety in paper audits; realistic norms, fire drills missing||MUMBAI: Are fire safety measures in hospitals on life-support? It may appear so with the blaze at Sunrise Hospital being the second such at a Covid-19 hospital in Bhandup-Mulund in the last six months. The tragedy was also a reminder of the fire in Bhandara that killed ten infants in January, creating a national uproar. In these three incidents over six months, 23 patients have lost their lives. In 2018 similarly, 13 patients, including infants, lost their lives at a fire in ESIC Hospital, Andheri. Following the Bhandara fire, an audit was ordered in Mumbai like the rest of the state, which many city hospitals called a knee-jerk reaction without any real intention to review the ground situation. The civic body served notices to 178 private hospitals and nursing homes for major fire safety violations out of 1,073 inspected. A civic official told TOI that Sunrise too was served a notice for not fulfilling norms. In the interim, two more patients died after smoke engulfed Mulund’s Apex Hospital due to a short circuit in a generator. One died in transit, while another died a day later. After the blaze, the BMC set up a four-member committee that prima facie found no negligence on the hospital’s part and concluded they had followed all protocols while transferring patients. However, the hospital is barred from admitting Covid-19 patients. In the Bhandara incident, the government panel mainly found faults with healthcare staff, seven of who were suspended for negligence. The hospital was reportedly working without a fire NOC since inception. In the ESIC fire, the department didn’t hold anyone responsible, and the hospital continues to be defunct. A senior doctor-cum-owner of a SoBo nursing home said the problem with audits was they are not done in the right spirit and are much like the annual inspections that remain on paper. “No fire official has stepped into my hospital for four years now. There are third party agents and agencies who take care of this business. I take my own precautions,” he said. Dr Lalit Kapoor, a founder member of the Association of Medical Consultants (AMC) said fire norms are imperative, but they must be practical too. “Small 10-15 bed nursing homes have the same requirements as big five-star hospitals. There is no middle ground,” he said. The AMC has engaged with government to form a panel to study the feasibility of existing norms, but things haven’t moved much. Another hospital proprietor said hospital fires “grab more eyeballs because people who are already sick are affected. But it is time to look at fire norms objectively. For instance, painting fire retardant doors that cost thousands are a hindrance for smaller establishments,” he said. Instead, focus should be on fire extinguishers, entry exit doors, periodic drills, he said. BJP MLA Mihir Kotecha said BMC had failed to do fire audits of hospitals before allowing them to admit Covid-19 patients. “There must be a detailed fire audit of all Covid-19 hospitals,” Kotecha said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hospital-safety-in-paper-audits-realistic-norms-fire-drills-missing/articleshow/81715423.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

---||Jaipur||Japan extends Rs 3,272 crore loan for water projects in 2 districts||NEW DELHI: Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) has extended an official development assistance (ODA) loan of Rs 3,272 crore for Rajasthan Rural Water Supply and Fluorosis Mitigation Project (Phase 2) in Jhunjhunu and Barmer districts to provide clean drinking water aimed at controlling water borne diseases. To achieve the objective, the fund will be spent on constructing water treatment plants and related facilities while building capacity at the community level. Most parts of the state are largely dependent on groundwater for drinking purposes. However, due to the increasing pressure of population, the groundwater recourses have been depleted and many sources are contaminated with nitrate, chloride and fluoride having above the permissible limits. Water borne diseases such as acute diarrhoeal diseases, enteric fever (typhoid), viral hepatitis and cholera have also been reported in these districts. The ODA loan agreement was signed between C S Mohapatra, additional secretary, department of economic affairs, ministry of finance and Matsumoto Katsuo, chief representative, JICA India. Speaking on the occasion, Katsuo said, “Groundwater quality in Rajasthan has been largely affected by the presence of both human-made pollutants and naturally derived fluoride in the rock strata. The fluoride level in the groundwater is well over the WHO drinking water permissible limit and undrinkable. Barmer was declared as drought prone area because of very low rain fall.

This has resulted in deteriorating quality of water, foaming, formation of weed and hyacinth in the lakes, the report said. Though the state government has been claiming that it is committed to the development of lakes and had spent several hundred crores for lakes’ development, in its compliance audit report on Protection and ‘Conservation of Lakes in Hyderabad Metropolitan Area’, the CAG found that the basic work — survey of lakes — was still incomplete. Only 5% of 165 lakes were notified as of June, 2018, even after giving the work to consultant and spending about Rs 12 crore. The report said many lakes were encroached upon by land grabbers and efforts should be made to evict them. The report pointed out that even in the case of notified lakes, the survey number of full tank levels (FTL) and buffer zones were not notified in the gazette. “The identified 3,132 lakes list was not comprehensive and excluded 146 lakes. Final notification of lakes was delayed. Even in the lakes that were finally notified and were supported by memoirs of irrigation department, it was noticed that the FTL notified was less than that in the memoirs by 120 acres,” the audit report pointed out. The Lake Protection Committee (LPC) did not have statutory powers to enforce its decisions and could not ensure coordination between multiple agencies like revenue, irrigation, and panchayat raj departments and failed to ensure implementation of its decisions which led to continuing pollution and deterioration of lakes, the CAG said. The audit report stated that the Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA) had given an action plan for conservation and beautification of 258 lakes to the state government. “Neither approval nor release of funds was received from government. As a result, the action plan could not be implemented. HMDA did not spend any amount on conservation and protection of lakes, except Rs 12.62 crore on survey of lakes during last five years i.e between 2013 and 2018,” it the audit report said. The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) had allocated Rs 287 crore between 2014 and 2018 on lakes, but finally it could spend only Rs 42.14 crore on protection and beautification works, construction of idol immersion ponds for Ganesha festival, Bathukamma festival arrangements, among other things.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/state-failed-to-protect-lakes-cag-report/articleshow/81713641.cms||Koride Mahesh

Armed with the vaccine, scores of senior citizens will be joining the festivities at places where only those who have taken the shot will be allowed. Retired engineer Jayanta Bhowmik will attend a gathering with his extended family at Dum Dum. “We took the first shot on March 8 and though we are aware that the risk has not been completely obliterated yet, the jab has given us some confidence,” Bhowmik said. He added that the family party will be attended by around 15-20 guests, most of whom have received their first vaccine shots while some are fully inoculated. “We expect the risk will be lower than last year when we were fighting against an unknown virus. Since we have restricted ourselves from attending any large social do over the last year, on Sunday, we are expecting to meet our relatives by maintaining social distancing and taking all the other Covid precautions,” he said. Both Bhowmik and his wife Ratna are scheduled to receive the second shot on April 6. Sajal Kumar Nan, a retired bank employee from Amherst Street, has taken the first jab. “I plan to attend a small family party on Holi. Though we are aware that the vaccine is not a passport to do away with Covid guidelines and does not guarantee that we will never catch the virus, it has given us some relief. We will abide by all the pandemic-related norms and meet some of our relatives,” Nan said. A doctor at NRS Medical College and Hospital, Digbijoy Bose, from Kalyani, said, “I will be meeting my friends after remaining on Covid duty for a year. Though the jab may not be fool-proof protection against the virus yet, it is offering some immunity, which has given me the confidence to meet my relatives at a party.” Another doctor, Chirayata Chattopadhyay, from Agarpara has been invited to a Holi party organized by friends. Though he has his regular medical duty on the day, he has consented to attend the party if time permits. “After receiving the first shot of the vaccine, I may have developed some immunity against the virus. Though it is not fool-proof, the first dose of vaccine has definitely generated some amount of confidence in me,” Chattopadhyay said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vax-shots-now-a-gate-pass-for-seniors-doctors-to-say-holi-hai-at-house-parties/articleshow/81713673.cms||Somdatta Basu

Speaking at an international webinar organised by Goa college of architecture (GCA) and Artis, a Lisbon-based organization on “Basilica of Bom Jesus in Goa: Past, present and (which) Future?”, the experts discussed various aspects of its architecture, visual history and conservation methods. Surface consolidation can work only if the remaining block is still sufficient to fulfil the functional purpose, but replacing it with a new block is costly and difficult on a large scale, experts said. “Rendering (plastering) of exposed surfaces is one of such measures. It works as a sacrificial layer and their effectiveness to protect vulnerable building elements has been proven for millennia,” Jose Delgado Rodrigues, a Portuguese geologist and stone conservationist said. While all stones wear out due to the exposure, the intensity of deterioration depends on weather conditions globally. A laterite stone being porous can hardly withstand hot and humid environmental conditions, experts said. A chorus for the restoration of Basilica’s plastered form has been growing over the past few years. As pointed out by Joaquim Rodrigues dos Santos, a Portuguese architectural historian said that the church had been de-plastered by Baltazar Castro at the behest of the Portuguese in the 1950s. “Baltazar Castro restored the Basilica of Bom Jesus causing a radical change in its image and at the same time provoking problems to its conservation,” Santos said. Over the years Goans have grown accustomed to its exposed laterite walls. Fleur D’Souza, a historian, said that restoration of heritage assets should not be entrusted to untrained people as it would inflict long-term damage to monuments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goans-accustomed-to-seeing-laterite-walls-of-basilica-but-it-needs-restoration-experts/articleshow/81715420.cms||Paul Fernandes

Atul Thakur, DCP (South), said the fire was so fierce that the cops could not enter the building. “They climbed the building from outside and reached the third floor. The balcony had grills that were bolted. The cops asked the victims not to panic while the effort to rescue them went on. The fire bridge, which had already been alerted, also reached the spot,” Thakur said. A police officer said a major impediment was the electricity pole near the building. “There was a mere two-feet gap between the pole and the building. Head constable Munni Lal and constable Sandeep, the first responders to the distress call, climbed to the third floor and tried to break down the grills, but didn’t succeed. They stayed on the balcony for about 20 minutes, offering the trapped trio damp cloths to help them avoid inhaling smoke,” the officer said. Atul Garg, director, Delhi Fire Service, said the firemen traced the source of the blaze to the second floor. “Four fire tenders arrived to contain the inferno. Firemen entered the building in protective suits and brought down the three people down. No one was injured in the incident,” said Garg. The fire chief said that the building was both an office and a residence. “The cause of fire is yet to be ascertained, but prima facie it was sparked by a short circuit,” Garg said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/87-yr-old-among-3-rescued-from-third-floor-fire-in-gk-i/articleshow/81714562.cms||---

Justice Gautam Patel heard a defamation suit by Malik against Venkateshwara Creations Pvt Ltd and V Venkata Ramana Reddy aka Dil Raju. The film V, released on Amazon Prime in September 2020, had used one of her pictures with reference to a “female escort or a commercial sex worker”. On Thursday, Malik’s advocates submitted two amounts suggested by each side for a “complete and overall settlement of the disputes...” “This would also, evidently, save each side the time, cost and trouble of going through a protracted civil litigation...,” Justice Patel said in the order. While Malik gave her consent, Justice Patel asked the producer’s advocate to take “specific written instructions one way or the other.” The court posted the matter on April 1.

We cannot undermine the ECI since it is the institution responsible for the conduct of free and fair polls,” said the first bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy while hearing a PIL filed by A Anand, president, Puducherry unit of the Democratic Youth Foundation of India (DYFI). The court observations came after senior counsel for EC G Rajagopalan said a show-cause notice had been issued to the BJP and it was police’s responsibility to probe the data source. Meanwhile, R S Gopalan, deputy director-general of Unique Identification Authority of India, in a statement, said “UIDAI has never shared any data with any entity other than its authorised user agencies.” While the court cautioned police that they should be aware of their duty despite the allegiance that they might seem to portray, the UIDAI rejected the allegations. “The user agencies are strictly prohibited from sharing any information about residents’ Aadhaar details. The recent allegations that UIDAI has shared residents’ details in bulk for purposes other than provided in the Aadhaar Act, are factually incorrect. UIDAI is committed to protecting privacy of residents always,” the statement said. Any disclosure of information (other than core biometric information), including identity information or authentication records, can only be made pursuant to an order of a judge of a high court, and that too after giving an opportunity of hearing to both the UIDAI and the concerned Aadhaar number-holder as per section 31 of the Act, he said. It was the petitioner Anand’s case that the Puducherry unit of the BJP was illegally accessing Aadhaar data and using the personal data of voters for election campaigns. According to the petitioner, the local BJP candidates obtained the mobile phone numbers of voters linked to Aadhaar and were using them to create WhatsApp groups in their respective constituencies for campaigning. Counsel for petitioner M N Sumathi informed the court that the petitioner was being harassed by the Puducherry police in the guise of inquiry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/puducherry/why-cant-pondy-polls-be-deferred/articleshow/81718062.cms||---

Wholesale traders from Beed city refused to open their stores during the two hours granted to them for business saying that it would lead to crowding and result in violation of social distancing norms. A wholesale trader from Beed said, “It is impossible to carry out an entire day's business in two hours. Customers are likely to rush during these two hours and end up violating social distancing norms.” Santosh Soni, another wholesale trader, said that unloading a truck carrying 25 tonnes of grains takes about five to six hours. “The conditions imposed by the authorities to complete all the transactions and works within two hours is impossible. We will continue to keep our shops closed till the district administration reconsiders the restrictions and gives us extended hours,” he told TOI. In Ashti taluka, BJP MLC Suresh Dhas took to the made the locals open the shops. A large number of traders and locals joined him as he walked through the commercial lanes of Ashti. “We don’t know if imposing a lockdown is going to check the spread of nCoV infection. We know for sure that this imposition of restrictions is ruining the economy and bringing down employment,” he said.

---||Lucknow||Law student case: Spl court acquits Chinmayanand||Lucknow: The special MP-MLA Court here on Friday acquitted former Union minister Swami Chinmayanand in connection with a case lodged for allegedly sexually exploiting a law student in Shahjahanpur. Pronouncing the judgment, special judge PK Rai said that the prosecution could not prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. The survivor had already turned hostile during the course of trial. Besides Chinmayanad, the court also acquitted the law student and other co–accused Sanjay Singh, DPS Rathore, Vikram Singh, Sachin Singh and Ajeet Singh in connection with extortion case. Chinmayanad, a former BJP MP who was junior home minister in Atal Bihari Vajpayee cabinet, had lodged a case of extortion against them, but the court couldn't find any evidence. All the witnesses had turned hostile in both the cases. At the time of pronouncement of verdict, Chinmayanand and other accused persons were present in the court. The Supreme Court had stepped in when the 23-year-old student went missing for a few days in August 2019 after posting a video clip on social media, alleging sexual abuse by the former minister. Her father lodged an FIR with Kotwali police station in Shahjahanpur police station on August 27, 2019 alleging that her daughter was pursuing LLM from the college run by Chinmayanad's trust and was living in hostel. Her mobile was switched off since August 23. On the other hand, Chinmayanad's advocate Om Singh lodged an FIR on August 25, 2019 with the same police station against the law student and others for demanding Rs 5 crore as extortion from him. The girl surfaced in Rajasthan a few days later and reiterated her charges. The Supreme Court took cognizance of the case and on its direction, the UP government formed a Special Investigation Team to probe both the charges. The SIT arrested both Chinmayanad and the students, along with her aides. The investigation in both the FIRs was completed and chargesheet filed against him on November 4, 2019. Chinmayanad was booked under Sections 376C (Using position of power for sexual favour), 354D (stalking), 342 (wrongful confinement) and 506 (intimidation) of the IPC. The law student and others were booked under Sections 385 (extortion) and several other sections of the IPC. After initial hearing in Shahjahanpur, the case was transferred to the MP-MLA court on the direction of the Allahabad high court. The hearing in the special court started in March 2020. During the course of hearing the law student, while appearing before the court in October 2020, turned hostile and withdrew her charges against Chinmayanand. She told the court that she had made the charges of sexual harassment under coercion from anti-social elements who “are enemies of the former Union minister”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/law-student-case-spl-court-acquits-chinmayanand/articleshow/81715428.cms||Ravi Singh Sisodiya

Sawant also said that he is unable to give a definite time frame for the Meat Complex to become operational as there is a ban on slaughter and transport of animals in both the neighbouring states – Karnataka and Maharashtra. “At present traders are unable to bring animals for slaughter as they are not getting the transport permit certificate from concerned authorities to bring animals from outside the state. Also, due to the Covid-19 outbreak and ban in Karnataka, traders are not bringing animals for slaughter at GMC,” he said. “There are 38 traders who used to bring animals for slaughter at the complex for supplying meat to the people of Goa. These traders are not bringing animals for slaughter due to the ban in Karnataka,” he said. Beef is presently being brought in from the neighbouring states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-intends-to-outsource-abattoir-cm/articleshow/81715427.cms||---

The woman also alleged she and her family member were facing threats to their lives. Earlier, Jarkiholi lodged a complaint against unidentified people for “framing him by creating the fake CD and blackmailing him”. The woman sent a two-page letter, written in Kannada, through her advocate KN Jagadish to Bengaluru’s Cubbon Park police station. Based on the complaint, police registered a first information report against Jarkiholi under IPC sections 376C (related to taking advantage of official position and inducing or seducing any woman to have sexual intercourse, not amounting to the offence of rape), 354A (sexual harassment), 417 (cheating), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace) and 506 (criminal intimidation), and section 67(A) of the Information Technology Act. The woman’s statement from the FIR read: “I had met Ramesh Jarkiholi for a documentary. At that time, he promised a government job and spoke with concern. He asked me to cooperate in all ways with him for the job and I trusted him. From Karnataka Bhavan in Delhi he made a video call to me and directed me to undress, I did. Later, he invited me to his apartment stating he wanted to discuss about my job. There he developed physical contact with me. Later, he abused me for asking (for) the job. After the sex CD went viral on media, life threats were issued against me and my family. I seek legal action against the accused for sexually exploiting me on pretext of giving me government job.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/was-sexually-exploited-says-girl-in-karnataka-cd/articleshow/81716995.cms||---

The bandh call, however, had a negligible impact in Ranchi city as shops and commercial institutions functioned normally and transport remained unaffected. JRKSSS members blocked the Bundu-Silli Road near Rahe for several hours to enforce the bandh. Claiming that the farm legislations were black laws, the agitators urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to ‘cast off his dictatorial approach’ and concede to the demands of the farmers. Meanwhile, Left parties including CPI, CPI(M), CPI(M-L) and their affiliated trade unions staged an hour-long dharna at Albert Ekka Chowk in Ranchi despite the imposition of Section 144 of the CrPC in Ranchi sadar area. The members also took out a procession from Albert Ekka Chowk and passed by Sujata Chowk and Ranchi University to return to the starting point. Notably, the district administration had prohibited any gathering of five or more people in the sadar area and put a ban on rallies and processions in view of the bandh. Citu general secretary Prakash Viplav said: “Initially we had planned to be in groups of four at Albert Ekka Chowk to register our protest. The number of people in the gathering, however, became so large that we were forced to change our programme.” The procession and the dharna caused traffic congestion for over an hour at the Albert Ekka Chowk. The Bank Employee Federation of India’s Jharkhand unit, too, took part in the rally, but the banks functioned as usual. There was no impact of the bandh in Bokaro and Dhanbad districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/left-parties-organise-dharna-farm-body-blocks-road-for-hrs/articleshow/81713456.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Covid spurt before Holi worries admin||RANCHI: A day after Jharkhand recorded the highest ever single-day spike of Covid-19 cases this year (278 cases), doctors and administrative officials, who played an important role in flattening the curve in the state, pointed at the negligence of the citizens who went lax after the cases dipped and the vaccination drive began in the country. Unrestricted movement of people from various parts, gaps in contact tracing, ignorance of protocols by vaccine beneficiaries and callousness among patients' kin in handling covid-19 patients are also leading to the spread of the virus, many said. Talking to TOI, medical director of Bhagwan Mahaveer Medica Superspecialty hospital Dr Vijay Mishra said, “There are many reasons behind the surge, but the most important one is the false hopes among the inoculated population that they have become immune to the virus. The lax behaviour of these people is increasing the chances of re-infection and people are falling prey to the Covid-19.” Mishra further said, “I have 28 patients admitted at the Covid-19 ward and half of them have either taken the first dose or both. If people are not following precautions after getting vaccinated then nobody can stop them from contracting the virus again.” With the caseload increasing in the state capital (574 active cases till Friday morning), the number of patients at the state’s only tertiary care centre for Covid-19, Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (Rims), is also increasing. Professor of Rims’s critical care department and trauma centre head Dr Pradeep Bhattacharya said, “We need to be disciplined and follow Covid appropriate behaviour as we haven’t been able to vaccinate even 10% of the total population of the state. Laxity on the part of the common man has increased and people can be seen crowding at market places without wearing masks. There are a limitations on treatment too as it requires resources and manpower and if people aren’t changing their attitude towards increasing them, then they will have to suffer the worst.” A few doctors also blamed the lax attitude of the government on contact tracing and testing rates and said there must be hundreds who are carrying the virus. “There must be a strict protocol wherein everyone needs to be tested and treated if they have returned to the state. They must be subjected to home quarantine and authorities must ensure that they are on surveillance. I have myself come across people who returned from Bengaluru and Mumbai and are roaming around in the city unabated,” said a senior consultant of a state-run medical college preferring anonymity. A senior administrative official who had worked during the outbreak last year said the reason behind this surge isn’t one-sided. “Last year no one knew what to do and what not to. But after a year, people are aware, but callous and ignore appropriate Covid behaviour.” A senior district administration official on anonymity said, “Many think that they won’t get infected while others are of the view that they do not require masks and sanitizers as they have already been infected. Police and administration can only ask them to follow the rules and penalise them, but we cannot monitor each individual round-the-clock and check for masks.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/covid-spurt-before-holi-worries-admin/articleshow/81713347.cms||Gaurav Pandey

---||Ranchi||Expand social security schemes, says RBI deputy governor||RANCHI: The deputy governor of Reserve Bank of India, M K Jain, on Friday stressed on the need to extend the ambit of social security schemes in the state and said bankers need to work together with the government in the field of financial inclusion and financial literacy in Jharkhand. “A large chunk of the population in state is still deprived of banking services and we need to take steps to connect them with the mainstream financial system at the earliest. In order to achieve that, we need to focus on expanding the net of financial inclusion as well as imparting financial literacy among the common populace,” Jain, while addressing the State-Level Bankers Committee meeting, said. He called upon the bankers to ensure that more and more beneficiaries are added to insurance schemes like Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY) and Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) so that in the event of the unforeseen circumstances like death in a family, for instance, the next of kin can get benefits from the scheme by paying a nominal premium. “PMSBY and PMJJBY are meant to provide financial assistance to those in the low-income groups so that they don’t lose social security benefits in case of exigencies. Bankers must promote these schemes when people visit banks,” he said. He appreciated the efforts of East Singhbhum bankers where 97% of the work to convert the district into a digital banking sector is done. “I would like to see the district achieving 100% digital banking services in the coming days,” he said. The meeting was attended by senior government officials and they expressed their concern on the depreciating cash deposit ratio and said that bankers need to work on improving it through collection and profitable loan disbursement. “We need to distribute more and more loans to promote entrepreneurship in Jharkhand and I would urge the bankers to assist people engaged in the fisheries sector in this regard. They also need to increase the number of education loans given to tribal students since it is not up to the mark,” state finance secretary Himani Pandey said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/expand-social-security-schemes-says-rbi-dy-guv/articleshow/81712469.cms||---

Anand further predicted that from March 30 onwards, daytime mercury levels are expected to rise a few notches. “In the first week of April, various places like Jamshedpur, Chaibasa and Daltonganj are likely to experience daytime temperatures up to 40°C,” he added. Meanwhile, on Friday, the daytime temperature in Ranchi was around 34.5°C while Jamshedpur recorded 37.8°C. Daltonganj recorded 36.6°C. Chaibasa was 38.4°C while Bokaro was 37°C. Daytime temperatures are up above normal by 1.5°C on an average across the state. IMD Ranchi ruled out the possibility of Nor’westers in the state in the next few days. “Nor’westers are likely to get delayed in Jharkhand this year unlike other years, where there are local thundershowers in March,” Anand said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/no-rain-on-holi-but-cloudy-weather-on-festive-eve-imd/articleshow/81713390.cms||---

Barring the Tatanagar Chhapra express, waiting lists of all others that touch the neighbouring state, including the Puri New Delhi Purushottam express, Tatanagar Danapur express and Durg Rajendranagar South Bihar Express have crossed 100 as on Friday. East Singhbhum district had 188 active cases till Wednesday morning. Meanwhile, the rail users association said in the wake of the pandemic, railways should have introduced at least three festival special trains from Tatanagar to Bihar to accommodate the rush. “More coaches should be added to regular trains and at least two special trains are needed to accommodate commuters at Tatanagar,” said Anand Moonka, ex-functionary of Chakradharpur Rail Users’ Consultative Committee. The station manager of Tatanagar, H K Balmuchu, said so far there’s no direction from the headquarters to introduce Holi special train from Tatanagar, but said coaches will be added to regular trains on March 27 and March 28. “One special train from Santragachi to Darbhanga via Tatanagar is scheduled on March 28,” Balmuchu said. Meanwhile, long distance bus operators said less people are opting for buses this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/ticket-sale-of-bihar-bound-trains-surges-ahead-of-holi/articleshow/81713370.cms||---

Last year as many as 200 BSL employees were infected with Covid-19. On Thursday, the district reported 11 new infections and the active caseload stood at 37. Meanwhile, Bokaro General Hospital (BGH) – where Bokaro MLA Biranchi Narayan is currently admitted after he tested positive for Covid-19 earlier this week — is contemplating opening another ward for Covid patients amid a spike in cases. At present, there are two wards in Dhanvantari block of the hospital for treating Covid patients. BGH’s executive director Dr A K Singh said, “There are 10 Covid patients currently admitted here but we are prepared to open one more ward if the number of patients goes up.” He also urged people to exercise caution and refrain from indulging in Holi revelry as the festival can become a super-spreader. “The Holi Milan functions, if organised this year, can lead to further spread of the virus,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bsl-urges-employees-to-avoid-large-holi-crowd/articleshow/81713316.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Running short of water at protest venue, agitating home guards block road for 6 hours||RANCHI: Hundreds of home guards staging a dharna near the Sai temple in Dhurwa under the banner of Jharkhand Home-guard Welfare Association (JHWA) seeking better service conditions blocked the Jagannathpur-Pundag Road for six hours on Friday after they ran short of water at the protest venue. Notably, the home guards have been staging an indefinite dharna at the venue assigned to them by the administration since March 8. The protestors are demanding facilities at par with their counterparts in neighbouring Bihar, including a payment of Rs 774 per day, regular duty and gratuity, among others. Carrying the national flag, the home guards shouted slogans in support of their demands. Two home guards also fainted at the dharna site owing to the searing heat. The protest was withdrawn at 1pm after the administration assured that it would provide a water tanker by the evening. The general secretary of the JHWA, Rajiv Tiwari, said: “The officials on Friday assured us that a proposal regarding our service conditions would be sent to the chief minister. But we will continue our agitation till our demands are met.” Tiwari added that in several districts, including East Singhbhum, Seraikela-Kharsawan, Simdega, Gumla, Koderma and Giridih, the members of the association have handed over weapons and cartridges to the government saying they would not work until their demands are met. Speaking on the issue, additional director general (operations) and senior spokesperson of Jharkhand police R K Mallick said, “The home guard is a voluntary force. We would assess the manpower and take a decision.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/running-short-of-water-at-protest-venue-agitating-home-guards-block-road-for-6-hrs/articleshow/81713443.cms||---

A case has been registered against the accused under different sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Criminal Law Amendment Act.

He also said that the party is committed to fulfilling the aspirations of the people and is confident of forming the state government after the 2022 assembly elections. The state’s public debt as on March 31 is projected at Rs 17,952 crore, with market loans forming a major part of the public debt. The economic survey 2020-21 indicates that central loans have shown a decline while market loans have shown an increase over the years. “When Digamber Kamat was chief minister, the state liability was a mere Rs 7,000 crore. We will try our level best to bring this liability down by at least 50% once we come in power. Not only this, we will revamp development and welfare of the people,” Chodankar said. He said the state’s financial position, particularly the liabilities, have reached an “alarming stage”. “People believe us when we say that we can deliver what they wish, this is proved by our action of scrapping the Regional Plan, SEZ, etc.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cong-will-cut-goas-debt-by-50-if-elected/articleshow/81714598.cms||---

Every two or three patients is said be in need of beds. The disturbing trend came to the fore on a day when Nagpur district broke all records, reporting 4,095 new cases in a day on Friday. These include 2,966 from Nagpur city alone, 1,126 from Nagpur district (rural) and 3 patients from other states/regions. The district also witnessed 35 deaths, though lower than Thursday. In all, 1,943 patients recovered in a day, which is the lowest in the last three days. Now, out of 2,11,162 cases, 1,69,407 have recovered in the district. The only relief factor was the reduced death toll. Friday reported 35 deaths, five less than Thursday’s 40. These include 18 deaths from the city, 14 from rural and 3 referred from other states. Total 17,625 tests were conducted on Friday in Nagpur. With more than 23% of them testing positive, Nagpur is still on high alert in terms of the sample positivity rate. With almost double new cases than recoveries, Nagpur’s recovery rate further dropped to 80.2%. With an unprecedented surge in new cases, especially in the last 7 days, Nagpur now has 36,936 patients under treatment. More than 76% of them (28,344) are recovering under home isolation. Activist Anasuya Kale Chhabrani told TOI that she could get a bed at a private hospital only after intervention of the hospital management. “If I as an activist has to use my contacts to secure a bed for a relative then what must be the scenario for the others. I was forced to do so because as a commoner, I didn’t get any success in 17 hospitals,” she said. Kale’s account of the ordeal is shocking as the NMC’S daily vacancy chart showed 494 beds vacant both on Thursday night and Friday evening. The trend is not limited to just private hospitals. Government hospitals too are witnessing clout wielding. Activist Joseph George said the GMCH has 128 beds vacant in the Covid ward yet patients were not being admitted. “Only those having a high profile reference are getting admissions at GMCH. A patient’s relative told me that someone from outside came and got admitted because of an influential reference. The man was waiting for three hours on oxygen support in the casualty ward but not getting a bed,” he said. Activists also accused some hospitals of admitting mild patients while the serious ones were doing the rounds of different hospitals in an ambulance. “I am feeling bad thinking about people who don’t have anyone. While I was able to help four-five people, I had to tell an equal number to search on their own. Everywhere the first response is ‘no bed’. They say beds will be available on discharge,” said Chhabrani. She added that last time, surprise visits ensured only moderate to severe patients were given admission. Additional municipal commissioner Jalaj Sharma agreed the situation was challenging but the civic body was taking all efforts. “We have come to know about mild cases occupying beds. We are planning action soon,” he said. Asked about more than one person occupying beds in private hospitals, Sharma said, “We haven’t seen this in private hospitals,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/only-well-connected-getting-beds-as-dist-reports-new-high-of-4095-cases/articleshow/81714591.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Nagpur||7 jail staff, including senior jailor, booked for sexual assault on transgender||NAGPUR: The Maharashtra prison department is facing embarrassment after the city police registered an offence of unnatural sex, molestation and other charges against seven jail personnel and two inmates of Nagpur Central Jail on the complaint of a 41-year-old transgender activist. The shocking crime in jail came to light over an year after the ordeal, only after the intervention of the high court. Dhantoli police have registered an offence against senior jailor Anand Kande, jailors Bhosle, Wankhede, Naik, Karpande, constable (guard) Sachin Tichkule and another unidentified jail guard along with under-trials Mukesh Yadav and Darshan Singh Kapoor. Police said the complainant had named Tichkule as the one who forced her into unnatural sex, while the rest were facing charges of having made undue advances towards her, apart from threatening her. She was also threatened before visiting the police station to lodge the report after the high court order earlier this week. It’s learnt the transgender, who was in jail after being arrested in a murder case in June 2019, started facing problems as soon as she was lodged in the male barrack. Despite repeated complaints, she was not shifted to the female barracks, which only aggravated her problem. The transgender was also physically frisked by the unidentified male jail guard despite registering her objection with Bhosle and Wankhede. The transgender had first written a complaint letter to the jail authorities in December 2019 and later alerted the chief judicial magistrate, who had also handed over her complaint to the district and additional sessions judge. Later, in 2020, the sessions judge had sought a reply on the matter from the jail authorities. Since no action was initiated, the transgender had approached the high court through her lawyer RS Nayak. In the petition, the transgender had mentioned about her sexual exploitation in the barracks and also shared her helplessness as no authorities were paying heed to her complaint. Senior inspector of Dhantoli police station Dileep Landge said special permission would be sought to visit the crime scene inside the jail. Jail superintendent Anup Kumar Kumre said a parallel inquiry has been initiated by jail authorities, and the report would be soon tabled before the deputy inspector general of prison, eastern region, for further action. “We had kept the complainant in a separate cell to avoid contact with others. The charges would be verified by the police,” he said.

---||Gurgaon||Haryana: Five months after Nikita Tomar’s murder, life sentences for killer & his aide||GURUGRAM: A fast-track court on Friday sentenced the two men convicted of killing BCom student Nikita Tomar to life imprisonment, rejecting pleas for leniency by their counsel, who argued the two convicts were young and did not have any previous criminal history. The two men, Touseef and Rehan, were held guilty earlier this week under sections 302 (murder), 366 (kidnapping a woman to compel her into marriage), 506 (criminal intimidation), 120B (criminal conspiracy) and 34 (common intention) of the IPC. Additional sessions judge of the special court, Sartaj Baswana, pronounced his judgement in open court. The judge observed that the convicts cut short the bright future of a young girl and deprived her parents of the love and affection of their daughter. The act presented a wrong example before society and deserved a punishment that sent a strong message to discourage youngsters from even thinking of committing such a crime, the court said, adding the convicts do not deserve any leniency. Nikita’s killing outside her college on October 26 last year had been captured on CCTV cameras, which showed Touseef shooting at her. Rehan was with Touseef. The footage proved crucial in the case. The court also relied on forensic reports and fingerprints recovered from the car used in the crime. Nikita’s family said it would approach the high court, seeking capital punishment. Aidal Singh Rawat, counsel for her family and Nikita’s maternal uncle, said they had argued for death sentence for the convicts. “We welcome the court decision and are happy that justice was done in a short period of time, but we are not satisfied with the quantum of punishment. We will approach the Punjab and Haryana High court to convert the life imprisonment into capital punishment,” said Rawat. A large number of lawyers and reporters were present in court for the judgment in a case, which was keenly watched because of the political row it had triggered. Nikita’s family has alleged that Touseef had been pressuring her to convert to Islam and marry him. A 700-page chargesheet filed by police listing 60 witnesses said Touseef had killed Nikita to take revenge. After she rejected his proposal in 2018, he had allegedly kidnapped her. A case had been registered and withdrawn later after a panchayat was held. Touseef, a cousin of Congress MLA Aftab Ahmed, and Nikita had known each other from school. Nikita, a final-year student, was killed just outside her college in Ballabhgarh. A third accused, Azaruddin, who was arrested for allegedly supplying weapons to Touseef, was acquitted for lack of evidence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/five-months-after-nikitas-murder-life-sentences-for-killer-his-aide/articleshow/81714644.cms||Bagish Jha

In its chargesheet, it has relied on technical evidence like call details, toll receipts and mobile location to establish the involvement of the SHO and the others. The SHO had surrendered before the bureau but did not cooperate with investigators or record his statement. He also denied consent for a narco test. The vigilance bureau has identified the role of three more policemen in the case — Gurmeet, Manoj and Rohila — and issued warrants against them. All of them have been on the run for the last three months. According to complainant Naveen Bhutani, nine policemen kidnapped him from a restaurant on December 22 and took him to Kherki Daula police station, where SHO Vishal Kumar allegedly thrashed him. The cops then allegedly kept him hostage at a farmhouse, setting him free only after he handed over Rs 55 lakh in cash, collected from branches of a gold finance company where the cops took him. The bureau has arrested three of the cops involved and identified three others, while four others are yet to be identified. Investigators are still trying to find out the trail of the money extorted from the complainant. Only Rs 1.8 lakh has been recovered from head constable Amit, who was arrested on December 29. The bureau is trying to find out who else, including senior officers, had got a share of the money.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/chargesheet-against-ex-sho-3-others-for-extortion/articleshow/81714659.cms||Bagish Jha
---||India||Shared future with Bangladesh can be vaccine against radicalism: PM Modi||NEW DELHI: A future where India and Bangladesh share their developmental journeys and can study, work and do business seamlessly would be the best natural vaccine against the toxic infusion of radicalism and extremism in our societies, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said. In an article in the Bangladesh newspaper 'The Daily Star', the Prime Minister said an era of cooperation, as might have been the case much earlier if Mujibur Rahman had not been assassinated, is again within grasp if the two counties seize the opportunities that beckon them. The PM said the dream of Bangabandhu is being realised by PM Sheikh Hasina and it is time to "chart a bold ambition for our partnership". "With the spirit and enterprise of our people, the dispenser of our people, such a future is closer than ever," he said. There was subtle political sub-text to his comments as well, as the discussion on shared development of maritime resources has a resonance in terms of stalled projects like cooperation over the Teesta river pact. These can be revived only if a BJP government assumes office in Kolkata as chief minister Mamata Banerjee is strongly opposed to the water sharing deal. Modi noted that the two countries have achieved an important objective of settling land and maritime boundaries. "Our trade has reached historic levels, aiding economic activities in each other's countries," he wrote. Cargo from Bangladesh can move through India to Nepal and Bhutan. Similar efforts are on to allow Indian goods to reach northeast India through Bangladesh. Waterways being developed will permit Bangladesh goods to reach Varanasi and Sahibganj. The PM said new friendship pipelines will bring the nations closer as will the Akhaura-Agartala road link. He said India will fully commit itself to development of Bangladesh on the landmark occasion of the 50th year of its War of Liberation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/shared-future-with-bangladesh-can-be-vaccine-against-radicalism-pm-modi/articleshow/81717020.cms||---

There was a poor response in the state too. The bandh had been called in the light of more than 100 days of the farmers’ protest at the Delhi border. Even as business continued as usual in the city, no impact was seen in the rural areas too. Farm leaders from the SKM, however, said there was no active participation from workers of both the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). Sandeep Gidde-Patil, one of the morcha leaders in Maharashtra, admitted the response was nominal. Patil said even restrictions due to Covid had its impact and volunteers did not come out insisting shopkeepers to down their shutters. Even traders had requested to continue operations as already there were losses due to the lockdown, he said. Sources say even the farm produce markets remained open in the interiors. Devanand Pawar, a Congress leader from Yavatmal, said, “Instead of forcing shops to shut, party workers held a day-long hunger strike to register their protest.” Patil said there was a nominal response in the 19 districts of Maharashtra where the Kisan Morcha or its allied outfits are active. The response was slightly better in districts like Nanded, Jalgaon and Nashik, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bharat-bandh-by-sanyukt-kisan-morcha-fails-to-make-an-impact/articleshow/81713896.cms||Shishir Arya

Standing committee chairman Ravi Aswani presented Rs6.19 lakh surplus budget, which was passed with majority votes amid protests by the opposition corporators. The meeting was presided over by mayor Rakhi Kancharlawar. Commissioner Rajesh Mohite, standing committee chairman Aswani, BJP leader of House Sandeep Awari, Congress leader Dr Mahakulkar, Janvikas Sena corporator Pappu Deshmukh, Shiv Sena leader Suresh Pachare and BSP leader Anil Ramteke were present in the House, while other corporators joined the meeting virtually due to Covid restrictions. With civic election looming next year, ruling BJP has ensured there is no tax hike in this budget. However, opposition corporators charged mayor Rakhi Kancharlawar of effecting tax hike in the guise of improving civic amenities. Corporator Deshmukh charged that even though the budget has been tagged as one without tax hike, the agenda for upcoming March 31 general body meeting clearly bares the devious motives of the ruling BJP. The issue of imposing tax up to Rs2,000 on every lavatory tank is on the agenda, he said. He charged that the ruling BJP has plans to put burden of new taxes on the citizens, already hit by the Covid pandemic. He claimed that the CMC has already started fresh assessment of properties in the city and property tax is likely to be hiked up to 40%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rs351cr-chanda-civic-budget-gets-nod-amid-protests/articleshow/81713932.cms||Mazhar Ali

BJP and MNS leaders have been gunning for Raut saying the guardian minister is busy with political campaigns in southern India, rather than being stationed in the district. Raut said his physical presence has nothing to do with handling the Covid-19 situation. “Every day we have online review meetings and all decisions are taken in consultation with me. Me being physically there has no bearing on the situation as local officials are working as per schedule. We have taken multiple decisions like increasing bed capacity, provisioning for extra oxygen cylinders and increased testing,” said Raut. While local BJP leaders are targeting Raut, leader of opposition in state assembly, Devendra Fadnavis, refrained from attacking him personally. On his arrival at Nagpur airport, Fadnavis said, “The situation is definitely serious in Nagpur but we will work with the government during this crisis.” Raut said he is keeping all stakeholders in the loop regarding the local situation. “In my last meeting, both Fadnavis and Union minister and city MP Nitin Gadkari were consulted and shared their inputs. We had asked for 30 vaccination centres but got only two. So, through Gadkari we are trying to get the extra allotment done because vaccination is the key here,” said Raut.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/taking-online-meetings-keeping-track-of-nagpur-all-day-raut/articleshow/81726286.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

Despite panchayats sending in their plans, the suggestions haven’t been incorporated into the draft plans, he said. Speaking at an awareness session on the draft CZMPs in Benaulim, he said that any corrections must be submitted along with the survey number. “Any suggestions sent in writing now have legal sanctity. They have to consider the suggestions very seriously now,” he said. The last time the plan was notified was in 1996 when villagers weren’t consulted, Alvares said. “That plan has been operating for the past 24 years. Once this new plan is approved, we cannot say whether it will remain in force for another 50 years. The public hearings must be taken very seriously,” he said. He asked sarpanchs to check the plan they have been sent as some have received the old plan instead.

Our containment strategies that have been praised the world over were based on such scientific inputs.” He added India was using genome sequencing to keep track of any changes in the nature of the virus. He, however, said the second wave was inevitable despite India’s preemptive and proactive approach. “Historically, pandemics have come in waves and Covid is no exception. This was witnessed when the second wave hit Europe and the Americas.” Read AlsoIndia's second Covid wave to peak in mid-April, may infect 25 lakh: SBI reportNEW DELHI: After a steady decline for almost four months, the number of coronavirus cases in India is on the rise again.

The government withdrew all its bus services, including city services, across the state in support of the bandh. Government offices functioned with skeleton staff and half-closed doors. YSRC leaders, while extending their support to the bandh, demanded the central government to drop the disinvestment proposal of Visakhapatnam Steel Plant. In Visakhapatnam, most commercial establishments, educational institutions and banks remained closed. The bandh was peaceful in the north Andhra districts of Srikakulam, Vizianagaram, Visakhapatnam, and the two Godavari districts. In the Rayalaseema region, the response was partial but peaceful. While bus services remained closed, commercial establishments and eateries were open. Schools and educational institutions were closed, but some government sector banks functioned as usual. In the temple city of Tirupati, pilgrim related activities went on smoothly as Tirumala-bound buses were exempted from the bandh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/bharat-bandh-evokes-mixed-response/articleshow/81713378.cms||---
