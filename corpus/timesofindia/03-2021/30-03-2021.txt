Banerjee did not mention either her Nandigram opponent, Suvendu Adhikari, or his father, Sisir Adhikari, by name but her first attempt to link the Adhikaris to the killings came on Sunday, four days before Nandigram's voters head to polls on Thursday. "How come the police spared the baap-beta in Nandigram? The police could not have entered Nandigram without their consent. They called cops here in 2007. Now they are urging courts to reopen the 2007 cases against those who resisted land acquisition," the CM said. She also accused Suvendu - again without naming him - of mobilising "outsiders" to attack her at Birulia Bazar on March 10. "It is he who mobilised ruffians from outside to attack me at Birulia Bazar. No one from Nandigram did it. You harmed me during the election campaign. Now I have to move on a wheelchair," the CM said on Monday. Suvendu did not respond to the Bengal CM's Nandigram comments but, instead, raised the communal pitch of his campaign. "Begum is losing. She does not talk to anyone other than Sufian (Sk Sufian) and Rukunuddin. Now I come to hear of another Dawood Ibrahim, Samad. She will create a mini-Pakistan here if she wins," he said, making an overt appeal on communal lines. Banerjee responded by appealing to communal amity. "They have to divide people on religious lines and spark riots (to win this election). I am not leaving the battlefield. I will fight and win. I believe in Hindu-Muslim-Sikh-Isai apas mein rahna bhai-bhai and want everyone to stay together," she said. Trinamool supporters mobbed Suvendu and abused him while he was moving out of Asadtala after a public meeting later on Monday. Central forces rescued and escorted him out in a convoy. Trinamool leaders claimed their workers were not involved in the incident. Banerjee's comments, which came 14 years after the Nandigram killings, could have been an attempt to turn sentiment against the Adhikaris in Nandigram - where the killings remain an emotive issue - felt locals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/west-bengal/mamata-links-father-son-duo-to-2007-killings-in-nandigram/articleshow/81749839.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

On Monday, a day after NIA recovered number plates among other electronic gadgets from Mithi river, Aurangabad resident Vijay Nade claimed that the two recovered number plates bearing the same registration numbers belonged to his car which was stolen from Aurangabad in November 2020. Two vehicles, a Scorpio in which explosives were placed and an Innova, which tailed it, had fake number plates. Based on information provided by Waze, NIA, with the help of divers, recovered one laptop, one printer, two hard discs, a pair of number plates, two CPUs and two DVRs from the Mithi river on Sunday. Several fake number plates were also recovered from the Scorpio, Innova and other SUVs used by Waze and his accomplices. Nade, a clerk with the social justice department in Jalna, owned a Maruti Eeco vehicle bearing registration number MH-20-DP-1539. He said that on November 16 last year, he registered a complaint of theft with the City Chowk police station of Aurangabad city. Nade, a resident of Chhatrapati Nagar, New Aurangabad, told he was stunned after his stolen car's registration number plates were found by NIA. City Chowk police inspector Sambhaji Pawar told TOI, "The case till date has remained undetected. We will communicate with the authorities there to find out if the car stolen from Aurangabad was used there, or if it was only the number plate that was used." Nade added, "I learnt about it after I started receiving calls from journalists asking for the whereabouts of the car registered in my name. This morning I reached out to police and demanded a probe." Read AlsoDivers recover ‘evidence’ Waze threw into riverThe National Investigating Agency on Sunday took arrested assistant police inspector Sachin Waze to the Mithi river in Mumbai, from where divers fished out a laptop and a cellphone belonging to him along with three hard disks, two car number plates and as many DVRs. The recorders are believed toThe DVRs were believed to have been installed at the Mumbai police headquarters and at the Thane housing society where Waze resided, sources said. The DVR at the police headquarters contained footage of vehicle movements at the police headquarters, while the second one reportedly shows that one of the two vehicles involved in the crime was parked in Waze's housing society. NIA officials said the recovered articles were identified by rightful owners/custodians, from whom the accused, Waze, had collected them illegally without proper documentation. Also, the laptop and printer recovered were used by Waze in his office. A visible effort was made by the accused to destroy the items as hammer marks are present on them, officials said. NIA has been looking for evidence on the basis of a statement by Riyazuddin Kazi, a cop who reported to Waze. All recovered items have added to the body of evidence gathered by NIA so far in its probe into how an explosives-laden Scorpio was planted near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s bungalow and the murder of Mansukh Hiran.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/waze-case-nia-now-fishes-out-aurangabad-car-no-plate-from-mithi/articleshow/81750818.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The directives said: "In case of grievous injuries, medical attention may be provided on humanitarian considerations." The letter, written by Manipur government's special secretary (home) H Gyan Prakash to the Deputy Commissioners, said that as a fallout of the events taking place in Myanmar, it is reported that the country's nationals have been trying to enter India through the border states including Manipur. Prakash asked the five DCs not to open any camps to provide food and shelter, the civil society organisations also should not be allowed to open any camps to provide shelter and food, people trying to enter or seek refuge should be politely turned away and Aadhaar enrolment should be stopped immediately and Aadhaar enrolment kits should be taken into safe custody. The Manipur Home Department has also sought a "report on action taken" by the concerned district administrations by Tuesday. According to officials, on Friday, some Myanmarese including women and children tried to enter Manipur through the Moreh-Tamu border but security forces did not allow them to enter. Manipur media reported that three injured Myanmar nationals with bullet wounds last week were allowed to enter Manipur and they have been admitted at Jawaharlal Nehru Institute of Medical Sciences (JNIMS) in Imphal. Two of them are critical. Meanwhile, according to the different official sources and bordering villagers over a thousand Myanmar nationals including some security personnel so far entered Mizoram and the local people and NGOs are providing them food and shelter on humanitarian ground. Mizoram chief minister Zoramthanga has urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to provide asylum, food and shelter to those refugees who have arrived in the state since the military seized power in Myanmar last month. Zoramthanga's March 18 letter to Modi sought his intervention so that the refugees from Myanmar are given asylum, food and shelter in India. Referring to Union Home Ministry's advisories to the chief secretaries of the four northeastern states bordering Myanmar and also to the Assam Rifles and Border Security Forces for taking action to prevent illegal influx from Myanmar into India, Zoramthanga said, "This is not acceptable to Mizoram."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/manipur-bars-myanmarese-entry-to-india-asks-dists-to-keep-vigil/articleshow/81751028.cms||---

He carried a reward of Rs 25 lakh on his head. An AK 47, a 303 rifle, an 8 mm, 12 bore rifle, detonators and a laptop were among the materials seized. Apart from the five killed, two bodies of their colleagues were dragged away by the Maoists from the place. Hichami, secretary of the Maoists' North Gadchiroli division and a Dandakaranya special zonal committee member (DKSZCM), was the mastermind behind the Jambhulkheda blast in 2019 in which 15 police personnel and one civilian were killed.  It is learnt that Hichami was upset over his wife Ramko's questionable encounter death and had planned the Jambhulkheda blast and Dadapur arson as revenge. Prior to the blast, the Naxals under Hichami had torched more than 30 vehicles in Dadapur village. Hichami's bodyguard Asmita Pada too was killed. Pada was part of the Tipagarh Local Organization Squad (LOS). Another senior Maoist cadre, Sukhdeo Neitam, deputy commander of Tipagarh LOS, was among the five gunned down. He too had five murder cases against him.  The other two Maoist casualties were Amar Kunjam of Kasnasur LOS and Sujata Atram of Platoon 15. Sujata too had 31 offences against her, including 11 murders. A substantial number of Maoists had assembled in the northern part of the district with sabotage plans as a part of their ongoing Tactical Counter Offensive Campaigns (TCOC). Gadchiroli police commandos too had stepped up their counter domination exercises in remote corners of the district and where Maharashtra shares boundaries with Chhattisgarh and Telangana. Search operations are on in the locality. DIG, Naxal range, Sandip Patil, said operations were already underway in the northern part of the district after information was received about the movement of Maoists in that stretch. "After the initial encounter around two days ago, our first party had returned. Then, the Naxals did not expect us to induct a second team so soon. This had caught them by surprise," he said. "Today, we surrounded the Naxals from all sides and left them with minimal exit points. The Naxals tried to flee through a narrow stretch and got hit," said Patil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/top-maoist-among-5-killed-in-gadchiroli/articleshow/81751083.cms||Soumitra Bose

The central forces reportedly had to chase away the protesters, who were allegedly raising slogans in favour of Trinamool. While Adhikari declined to comment, Trinamool said they had nothing to do with the local protests. Earlier in the day, Adhikari held a road show and addressed a public meeting at Nandigram. While he was addressing the meeting, a group of motorcycle-borne Trinamool supporters headed in the direction were reportedly stopped by police due to the ongoing BJP gathering. After completing the meeting, as Adhikari left the place, his vehicle was reportedly stopped. The central forces alighted and guided Adhikari’s vehicle away. Cops from the local police station also chased away the protesters, leading to a clash. Though Trinamool claimed the locals were not their supporters, Adhikari, who had gone to Bhitunia, did not want to comment on the incident. He, however, claimed “Trinamool goons had been attacking his vehicle systematically and periodically” but he was “least bothered about such stupid acts”. At Bhitunia, Adhikari kept up his attacks on chief minister Mamata Banerjee. “Manoniya (honourable lady) is being accompanied by her supporters, who celebrate Pakistan’s victory with fireworks,” he said. Dubbing his former party a “Pvt Ltd Co” run by “pishi (aunt) and bhaipo (nephew)”, where everyone was a lamp post, he claimed he was the first to show courage and join BJP to be part of “double-engine” government. Adhikari. who is likely to be with Union home minister Amit Shah in a road show on Tuesday, intensified his campaign in Nandigram, which will go to the polls on April 1. Starting from Boyal panchayats (1 and 2), he launched an attack on the CM, referring to her as “Begum”. He harped on the Hindu-Muslim narrative and Banerjee’s alleged appeasement policies. He also told people it wouldn’t be “Didi’r police” but “Dada’r police”, who will conduct the polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/suvendu-faces-protests-in-adhikari-backyard/articleshow/81749248.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

A case against the unit owner has been registered with the Nashik Road police station and MSEDCL official Hemant Tidke said the accused had used some gadgets to steal the electricity. According to Tidke, based on the tip-off and strategic information about the power theft, the flying squad raided the unit that has been functioning in a residential area of Nashik city. “The power theft was carried out by using of a technical instrument and arrangement such that the meter fails to calculate the actual power consumed,” the official said. Since it is a thermal-based unit, it consumes very high power and the theft is believed to have been taken place from May 2019 till February 2021. The accused is believed to have consumed 15,750 units of power valued at Rs 2.4 lakh. Earlier, the MSEDCL’s Information Technology (IT) department had pointed out difference between power consumption and the power bills realized in the area. The flying squad therefore carried out the intelligence gathering first and then found out that there was a consumer who had plastic a processing unit and the relative power consumption (billed amount) was too low. Based on this assumptions, the power utility team kept a close watch on the consumption pattern of the consumer and finally took action by unearthing the power theft and then registering a complaint with the police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/msedcls-flying-unit-unearths-power-theft-of-rs-2-4l-in-nashik/articleshow/81749838.cms||---

The Nashik city transporters said most of the transporters have their offices located in the Dwarka area of the city. On Saturday, a transporter faced action from the police at around 8 pm, when he was loading goods in a truck. The transporters in a memorandum to city police commissioner Deepak Pandey said the transport sector is the backbone of the Indian economy and even during the Covid outbreak, this sector has provided service around the clock. This time, when the cases are increasing again, the Union and state governments have put certain restrictions on the timing of operations for certain businesses. However, there must be certain concessions on the operating hours of transport businesses.  The memorandum said if action against transporters is taken, it will be difficult for the transporters to provide services. The memorandum has been signed by Rajendra Nana Phad, the president of Nashik Transporters’ Association||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/dont-brand-us-non-essential-transporters/articleshow/81748085.cms||---

The continuous rise in steel prices is likely to take a toll on the real estate sector in general, and particularly in Krishna and Guntur districts, largely due to the peculiar market conditions of the region. In a period of just four months, steel prices have almost doubled from Rs 45,000 in November 2020 to Rs 72,000 in March 2021. Prices of steel are expected to increase by another Rs 4,000 after April 1. Sunil Nuthakki, a builder from Poranki, said that increase in steel prices would mean a cost increase of Rs 70 to Rs 80 per square foot, adding that the prices of all building materials have risen by 40 to 50% in the last six months. Even as raw material costs are continuously going up, builders in Krishna and Guntur districts do not have the liberty to increase the prices of finished houses because of subdued demand. With uncertainty over the fate of the capital, buyers are not yet ready to invest in houses in the region, even though Y Rambabu, another builder, said they witnessed some improvement in demand in the early days after the lockdown was eased. However, after lockdown restrictions were eased, prices of raw material skyrocketed despite capital uncertainty. “We cannot increase the prices according to raw material costs as the demand has not improved. The future of real estate and construction sector look very bleak presently,” said Rambabu. While input prices eat away at margins, some builders, especially small builders, have taken to supplying poor quality of raw materials. “They are using low quality iron and cement to reduce the costs as they could not increase the prices,” said another builder on condition of anonymity, adding that “We are forced to lower construction costs as we cannot increase the price.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/steel-price-rise-may-stifle-demand-fear-realtors/articleshow/81748584.cms||Srikanth Aluri
---||Business||Minority shareholders should ink pacts for board seat in investee company: Experts||MUMBAI: Small shareholders can have a representation on the board of the investee company but not minority shareholders, ruled the Supreme Court in the Tata Sons versus Shapoorji Pallonji (SP) Group case. SP, with a 18.4% stake in Tata Sons, is the single-largest shareholder in the private limited company. Company law experts said it’s important that minority shareholders have agreements for allocation of seats on the board of an investee company and amend its articles of association (AoA) accordingly. India doesn’t have a proper definition on minority shareholders, though it defines a small shareholder explicitly. “The right to claim proportionate representation is not available to a minority shareholder both under the 1956 Companies Act and under the 2013 Act. It is only to a ‘small shareholder’, which SP Group is certainly not,” the judgment said. Minority shareholder is widely referred to as someone who owns less than 50% of the total voting rights of a company or someone who owns less than the majority shareholder. On the other hand, a small shareholder is someone who holds shares worth at least Rs 20,000. “In the absence of proportional representation in the Companies Act, there are no special rights for a minority shareholder to appoint a director. Even a ‘small shareholder’ derives its reins to appoint a director through the provisions under the Act and rules. As seen from the Alembic case, this is easier said than done,” said Economic Laws Practice managing partner Suhail Nathani. In 2017, an asset manager Unifi Capital tried to get a seat on the board of Alembic through the small shareholder route but the company rejected its proposal. To table a board seat proposal, at least 1,000 small shareholders or 10% of the total small shareholders of the company, whichever is lesser, should come together and submit a notice to the company. “The right to claim proportionate representation is not available for SP even contractually, in terms of the AoA. Neither SP nor (its director) Cyrus Mistry can request the (lower court) to rewrite the contract, by seeking an amendment of the AoA,” the judgment said. AnantLaw partner Rahul Goel said even though the Companies Act does not automatically grant a right of proportionate representation to a minority shareholder, establishment of a contract may grant such a right. “Going forward, it will be important for all minority shareholders to have an agreement to that effect as well as the articles of association amended to capture the allocation/division of board seats,” Goel said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/minority-shareholders-should-ink-pacts-for-board-seat-in-investee-co-experts/articleshow/81750533.cms||Reeba Zachariah

Ongoing repair works have led to road congestion at Five Route, Moghalrajpuram and Gunadala. The energy department had started underground high tension cable installation in the city from Vidyut Soudha at Gunadala to Moghalrajpuram. Roads were excavated as part of the installation, but the work that started a couple of months ago has been left incomplete. In fact, Eluru road at ESI Junction has become a traffic hotspot, witnessing a number of minor mishaps over the last few weeks. With excavation work underway and barricades arranged by energy authorities, there is little room left for commuters. “We are facing traffic problems with congested roads at ESI Junction. Officials excavated the road a month ago and left the work aside. Many minor mishaps happened at this spot in the last twenty days. Hundreds of city buses and other vehicles pass through this road and we are trying to avoid commuting on this road,” said M Narasimha Rao, a resident of Veterinary Colony. Traffic at Jammichettu Centre, VP Siddhartha School junction is no different. A section of the road from Jammichettu to the Mother Teresa statue has been blocked for three months now to facilitate cabling works and traffic congestion has become the order of the day here. Meanwhile, excavated sections of the road have turned into breeding hubs for mosquitoes while pits were filled with drain water are raising a stink. “We are facing mosquito menace even in summer with underground cable works. Mosquito larvae are visible on the stangnant water and the health wing of the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) has not taken up anti-larval measures. Higher officials are requested to respond,” said M Madhavai, a resident of Gunadala. In several areas of the city, stormwater drain works have also been left incomplete, posing a problem for the residents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/slowdown-in-underground-works-holds-up-traffic-in-vij/articleshow/81748543.cms||Venu Lanka

It, however, didn’t reveal the identity of the parties nor the number of expressions it received for the steel asset. ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel and JSW Steel have submitted their interests for the public sector unit located in Odisha’s Kalinga Nagar, which is pretty close to Tata Steel’s plant, said people in the know. The last date to submit the expression of interest was March 29. “The transaction moves ahead to the second stage,” said Dipam’s tweet. Tata Steel too has thrown its hat in the ring for the proposed acquisition of Neelachal. All the three potential bidders have snapped up bankrupt assets to ramp up their play in one of the world’s largest economies. ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel acquired Essar Steel, gaining control of the largest metal maker in western India, while JSW Steel bought Bhushan Power, catapulting it to the top position in terms of capacity. And Tata Steel purchased Bhushan Steel. There’s not much of a difference between Tata and JSW’s steel capacities. The latter has a lead of half a million tons over Tata. Vedanta-owned ESL too is believed to have shown interest for Neelachal, though it couldn’t be confirmed. Neelachal, co-owned by Central and state governments, churns out 1.1 million tons of long steel. Long steel, which are rod, rail and bars, is used mainly by the construction sector. The government is divesting about 94% in Neelachal, which also has its own power plant and iron ore mines. Neelachal has been making losses since fiscal 2013. In fiscal 2020, its losses touched Rs 1,758 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/govt-finds-multiple-takers-for-steel-co-neelachal-ispat/articleshow/81750530.cms||Reeba Zachariah

Dwivedi is among the nearly 1.4 lakh Shakti ‘ammas’ — as the women entrepreneurs are called — across 18 states covered by HUL’s Project Shakti. A rural distribution network of HUL, Shakti was set up to enhance livelihoods and build opportunities for women micro-entrepreneurs in the hinterland. Covid did not deter the 25-year old Dwivedi — a graduate who hails from a family of farmers — from ensuring handwash and hygiene products reached households in and around her village. When people didn’t step out to buy their daily use products at village stores, the likes of Dwivedi distributed the same from house to house. “Following the outbreak of Covid, in the beginning there were many hurdles in getting products across to households. At the same time, there was a demand for hand washes, detergents and sanitisers — all of which are required for hygiene and safety. My father travelled to nearby villages to distribute these products, while I ensured that the houses in our village were well stocked,” Dwivedi told TOI. HUL’s Shakti network now covers half the villages in rural India, as compared to only 25% four years ago. During these four years, the network has doubled in number. So in 2020, when logistics got disrupted, it was this very network that came to HUL’s rescue. Efforts put in by the women entrepreneurs in dramatically stepping up physical reach of products to rural households is a key reason why these markets remained somewhat resilient as compared to urban. HUL executive director (sales & customer development) Srinandan Sundaram said, “Shakti has got the scale and is now part of our mainstream business. During Covid, this channel led growth for us. There were enough instances of Shakti entrepreneurs travelling to distributors to pick up stocks and come back to distribute to the households in their vicinity. This dramatically stepped up physical reach of our products, making them available to possibly the most vulnerable sections of society.” Sundaram said Shakti’s contribution to the turnover has moved up and it’s now sizeable. “We grew faster in rural as the Shakti channel significantly outgrew overall HUL’s growth,” he said, without revealing the exact numbers. Other FMCG companies do not have a Shakti kind of model in rural areas. But most are chalking out strategies to increase rural penetration and are designing products specifically for these markets. Procter & Gamble India is investing in increasing its reach in media-dark rural areas. It is looking at stores in these regions as media vehicles to enhance visibility. Recently, Nestle India said it wants to reach around 1.2 lakh villages over a few years. On the other hand, continuous focus by Marico to expand direct reach has enabled the company in developing a network of 6,200 stockists in the rural market. This is a growth of 30% since fiscal year 2019. In its December quarter results statement, Marico said it plans to further grow the network by around 20% in a couple of years. Interestingly, Shakti was identified as a CSR activity and in 2019-20, HUL spent Rs 53 crore on the network. While 2020 was a tough year for almost all businesses and individuals in terms of their incomes and salaries, Dwivedi said what she earned last year was better than 2019. Reverse migration during the pandemic also helped rural markets grow ahead of urban. In 2019, the overall industry’s rural growth had dipped on account of the slowdown. As for Shakti, according to HUL, the all-India average income grew 1.3 times between 2016 and 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/shakti-network-powers-huls-rural-growth/articleshow/81750547.cms||Namrata Singh
---||Kolkata||583 rogue revellers, most on bikes, held over Dol-Holi||Kolkata: It was a cat-and-mouse game between Holi revellers — mostly on bikes — and cops at city crossings on Dol and Holi. The number of arrests stood at 308 till 5pm on Sunday and 275 till 5pm on Monday with close to 7.6 litres of alcohol seized. With the elections ahead and rising number of Covid cases, the 583 arrests was a big jump from last year’s 117. The city traffic police separately took action against hundreds of bikers on Sunday by setting up over 700 pickets. In a bid to rein in errant bikers on Dol and Holi, cops carried out special drives. However, as afternoon set in, locals, especially those in the northern suburbs and central Kolkata, complained of helmetless bikers and instances of more than two riders per vehicle zooming through the neighbourhoods. A sergeant at Esplanade recounted how he chased down a bike with four youths in the Mayo Road area but found they jumped all the signals to flee towards Kidderpore. At the DL Khan Road-AJC Bose Road Crossing, a biker and his 10-year-old son were hit by an app cab after cops said they tried overtaking from the left. The most important stretch of the crackdown was between Naktala and Garia, with the naka on Boral Main Road yielding 20 punitive actions. Most were riding without helmet and had more than two persons on bikes. Areas in central Kolkata, like Entally, Posta and Burrabazar, too, had a large number of offenders. There was punitive action against 20-25 bikers at Ananda Palit Road-Sundari Mohan Avenue crossing, Kalakar Street-Hariram Goenka Street and CR Avenue-Ganesh Chandra Avenue crossing. Shyambazar and Karunamoyee bridge at Putiari, however, saw fewer prosecutions compared to last year. Most bikers who did not wear helmets went without masks as well. While reports of challaning those not wearing masks came from Maniktala, Beliaghata, Behala, Garia and Rajabazar, there were virtually no checks on offenders at Raja Dinendra Street, parts of CR Avenue, Sudder Street and Camac street. “We had instructed our men to focus on the job despite jibes and even veiled threats. We did not even spare locals,” said an officer. “People driving drunk has become common and we checked every youth on a bike or in a car. Local police stations worked provided back-up. In the Howrah Bridge and Jorabagan traffic guards alone, we recorded 85 cases of drink driving this month. Till 2019, it was less than 25,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/583-rogue-revellers-most-on-bikes-held-over-dol-holi/articleshow/81749018.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The committee has been playing a pivotal role in continuing the farmers’ protests in Delhi against the new farm laws. The 46-year-old farmer has been campaigning for candidates of the DMK alliance for the upcoming assembly election in the state.He said the policies adopted by the BJP government at the Centre are not just against farmers but against the interests of the people at large. People in Tamil Nadu should understand that farm laws are not just the issues of people in the northern part of the country. He said the government in Tamil Nadu may not be able to continue the free rice distribution scheme if the new farm laws are implemented, he said. “By abolishing the agricultural produce marketing committee (APMC) or the mandi system through the new farm laws, the BJP is attempting to give control of the farmer’s produce to corporates,” he said.Campaigning in Pudukottai district for DMK candidate Meyyanathan in Alangudi constituency, he said they are working for defeating BJP candidates in all the states that are going to polls. It has been four months since the farmers’ protest began on December 26. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other ministers are coming to the states for poll campaigns. But they don’t have time to solve the issues of the farmers, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/defeat-aiadmk-bjp-combo-for-farmers-cause-punjab-farmer/articleshow/81750697.cms||Sampath Kumar

At a review meet with officials, energy minister Balineni Srinivasa Reddy pointed out that the state was currently meeting its energy demand of 220.6 MU/day as on March 27 and that this demand is likely to go up to 222 MU/day over the coming days. The minister said the government’s decision to supply nine hours of free power to the agriculture was one of the reasons behind the increase in energy demand. He directed officials to place special focus on effective implementation of free power to the sector. “AP is the only state successfully implementing artificial intelligence to forecast energy demand in summer. This will help avoid shortages and save money for power utilities,” he said. In view of the huge demand, power utilities will have to utilise multiple sources to meet expected higher daily grid demand. “All long-term resources of power generation available with discoms would be utilised in full and power would also be purchased from power exchanges to meet additional demand,” he explained. Officials told the minister that of the current grid consumption of 217 to 218 MU per day, AP is availing the full extent of nearly 100 MU produced by generating units in the state, around 40 to 45 MU from central generating stations, 30 to 35 MU through renewables, 10 MU from other sources like IPPs while purchasing the remaining 35 to 45 MU from power exchanges to ensure smooth power supply. Energy secretary Srikant Nagulapalli told the minister that demand for electricity had been increasing in the state for various reasons. The consumption of energy was recorded as 185 MU in 2018 which increased to 218 MU in 2020-21. The peak energy consumption of 220.6 MU was recorded on March 27, 2021. Similarly, the maximum demand recorded in 2018-19 was 8,984 MW, which rose to 11,193 MW in 2020-21.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/power-demand-likely-to-touch-222mu/day-soon-energy-min/articleshow/81748566.cms||---

IDBI Bank MD & CEO Rakesh Sharma told TOI that the bank had used the four-year interregnum to restructure its business, cut exposure to large loans and bulk deposits and create verticals for various lending businesses to speed up turnaround time. As a result, the institution has transformed from a project financier to a retail lender. “While our retail portfolio grew during the moratorium period, we were not able to cater to the corporates. We are now looking at the mid-corporate segment, particularly the good companies which were our partners earlier and we could not extend loans because of restrictions under the PCA,” said Sharma. He said that the bank was looking at Rs 4,000 crore of recoveries in the next fiscal year. In addition, it was willing to sell a 25% stake in Ageas Federal Life (formerly IDBI Federal Life) to the foreign partner if they wanted to acquire the stake once the increase in foreign direct investment (FDI) is allowed. IDBI Intech is a 100% subsidiary of the bank. The company provides end-to-end IT services to IDBI Bank, its group companies, its ultimate parent company LIC, as well as other external clients in the BFSI sector. The company was currently in the process of appointing merchant bankers to help identify a strategic joint venture partner. IDBI Capital Markets is the merchant banking arm of IDBI Bank and the lender is looking for a strategic partner in this company as well. The RBI’s PCA places restrictions on weak banks from offering large loans to corporates and offering salary hikes for management and from expanding business. Sharma said that the bank did hire specialists from the market, but now that it was out of PCA it would do more lateral recruitments and continue to hire from campuses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/idbi-bank-eyes-stake-sales-in-subsidiaries/articleshow/81750509.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Kolkata||Forced back into forest, Sunderbans honey collectors want jobs for vote||Lahiripur/Satjelia: A Sunderbans village that was almost a symbol of development with residents shrugging off honey collection and crab hunting, has been jolted by Covid and Amphan, which brought migrant workers back. This forced them to head back into the jungle, leading to a record number of deaths by tiger mauling in the past year. The poll demand this time, thus, is not development, but jobs. Lahiripur, 25km from Gosaba and 115km from Kolkata, has metal roads, electricity and drinking water. But in the past year, more than seven persons have succumbed to tiger attacks. This is the most among all islands in the Sunderbans that has registered a record number of deaths in 2020 — 24, a five-year high. Sulata Mondal (34) of Lahiripur Chargheri recounted to TOI how her husband Sujit — a honey collector turned migrant worker — was dragged away by a big cat eight months ago. “He had given up the risky task of a honey collection and was working in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands for five years before the lockdown forced him to return. Sujit went to fetch crabs with his old honey collectors’ team and never returned. All that could be found was his blood-spattered torn shirt,” said Mondal, who has two children and works as a day labourer in the fields. Debi Mistry (45) who lives with sons Milan and Mrinal spoke of her husband Jamini, a businessman at Baghajatin market in Kolkata, who fought a tiger to save his son while collecting honey, but ended up as a victim himself. The Mistrys used to be among the few affluent families in the village with a two-storey house on sprawling premises, farmlands and gardens at Lahiripur. The lockdown-imposed restrictions on honey collection and Amphan left most fields and ponds inundated with saline water and damaged the trees where bees make hives. “With a number of migrant workers returning, even inexperienced groups ventured into the forests to catch crabs,” said Pranabesh Maiti, who runs an NGO for the welfare of Sunderbans villagers. Tapas Das, the field officer of Sunderbans Tiger Reserve, said fresh guidelines have been issued for honey collectors. Local MLA and Trinamool candidate from Gosaba, Jayanta Naskar, said, “We have developed the area but villagers still go in search of crabs.” Local BJP leader Paritosh Mondal said if voted to power, they will generate jobs so that villagers don’t have to go to the forest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/forced-back-into-forest-sunderbans-honey-collectors-want-jobs-for-vote/articleshow/81749029.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

He said the Centre has given environment clearance to Karnataka for the Mekadatu dam construction across the Cauvery river,which is against the interest of the water needs of Tamil Nadu. He also questioned the Centre for arresting people in Tamil Nadu using National Investigation Agency (NIA) for the purpose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/mukilan-to-protest-during-pm-modis-visit-in-dharapuram/articleshow/81750701.cms||---

Estimated to have an annual turnover of Rs 3 to Rs 5 crore, hundreds of women in the village are actively involved in the jelly-making process that had followed conventional methods till a few years ago. A project sanctioned by the department of science and technology (DST) in May 2018 changed the course of mango jelly production, empowering the women to tap into demand in states such as Telangana, Odisha, Maharashtra, etc. The women were trained in using solar drying technology and hygienic processing and packing methods, which have come in handy during the post-harvest season while also contributing to value addition. Dr Imandi Sarat Babu, associate professor, department of biotechnology, Gitam Institute of Technology, said the project by DST-SEED is titled, “Development and extension of technologies to improve livelihood of small farm holders at Alamanda, north-coastal Andhra Pradesh” and focuses on developing livelihoods of unemployed women. Explaining the progress of the project, Dr Sarat Babu said during a baseline study in 2018, it was felt there was a need to train women in modern technologies given the foreign export potential of mango jelly. “The solar drying, vacuum packaging and other modern technologies have enhanced the shelf life of the jelly. Various other products have also been experimented with the help of solar dryers, such as vegetable powders, dry fruits, dry prawns and ﬁsh which can be sold in markets,” added Sarat Babu. Dr Sarat Babu added that women in the village are also being trained on in-situ, low cost production of tissue culture banana plantlets. “The lab-grown banana variety Grand Nain, being pest- and disease-free, has significantly improved crop yield in this village. The women have also been trained in goat meat processing by leveraging modern equipment,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/modern-technologies-empower-women-in-alamanda/articleshow/81748599.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Business||Repay compound interest paid by borrowers, IBA tells banks||MUMBAI: The Indian Banks Association (IBA) has asked its members to exclude the moratorium period while calculating the number of days for deciding the status of a non-performing loan. In a letter dated March 26, the association has told banks that it will ask the government to compensate lenders for returning to borrowers the interest on the interest payable on installments during the moratorium period. In its management committee meeting on March 25, the IBA had decided that banks should refund any compound interest, interest on interest or penal interest if charged on borrower accounts. In the case of borrowers with outstanding below Rs 2 crore, the government had notified repayment of interest on interest by lenders, irrespective of whether the borrower had been charged the compound interest. The government had also said that it will compensate all lenders for this payment under an ex-gratia scheme. “The moratorium period (March 1-August 31, 2020) to be excluded for reckoning number of days for deciding NPA status under prudential norms. This is regardless of whether the moratorium was requested or not by the borrower,” the IBA told banks. Bankers told TOI that there were indications that the government might not compensate lenders this time. Banks are likely to make provisions for the compensation in their books for the current financial year although the actual payout is likely to happen in April 2021. The exclusion of the moratorium period for calculating the age of NPA will help both banks and borrowers. Many borrowers have been holding back from payment in the hope that there would some relief from the Supreme Court. In terms of RBI norms, banks have to steadily increase the provision for a stressed loan as the days past due increase. The first level of provisioning (usually 15% of the loan amount) is made when it is 90 days overdue. Every quarter after that the provisions increase as the loan moves from sub-standard to loss.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/repay-compound-interest-paid-by-borrowers-iba-tells-banks/articleshow/81750520.cms||Mayur Shetty

The minister has urged the people to take extra care in order to curb the spread of the infection that would be in the interest of everyone. “Nashik district is among the top five districts in the country with Covid-19 patients and this is a serious thing to ponder. The citizens have to fight the infection themselves even as the administration is making efforts by ensuring enough medicines and treatment facilities for the patients,” Bhuse said. The minister said that all the people including the elected representative should take all measures to fight against the disease and the infection would be drastically reduced in a short span of time. Bhuse called upon all the employees of the government to stay at their headquarters and take up the responsibilities during the trying conditions warning that serious action would be taken against those who do not falling in line. District health officer Kapil Aher, during the meeting, appealed to the masses to support the administration by sticking to the Covid-related health advisory and cooperate with the health teams in surveys, medicines, isolations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/bhuse-tells-malegaon-residents-to-not-opt-for-home-isolation/articleshow/81748093.cms||Abhilash Botekar

Taking these objections up for discussion at a meeting, the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA) has clarified that the legality of a structure is not decided just because it has reflected or has not reflected in the maps. The Authority has therefore said that it would be writing to the National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management (NCSCM), Chennaistating that only structures on the foreshore like jetties or others of archaeological importance, etc, should reflect on the CZMP maps. “The Authority decided to recommend to the NCSCM not to show any structures on the CZMP maps, except structures on the foreshore such as jetties, wharves, quays, ramps, lighthouses, beacons, and areas or structures of archeological importance or heritage sites,” the GCZMA decision states. GCZMA has clarified that NCSCM was given cadastral maps of the directorate of settlement and land records (DSLR). These maps were promulgated in the 1970s and the same were used as base maps to prepare the CZMP. The structures shown in the cadastral maps are the ones reflecting in the draft CZMP for Goa, the Authority has said. “The Authority has received numerous objections and suggestions from the public stating that their structures are not shown in the draft CZMP or a structure is wrongly shown in the draft CZMP. The Authority is of the opinion that legality of a structure cannot be decided on the basis of being shown or not shown in the DSLR maps as they were promulgated in the 1970s and no further promulgated maps of February 1991 are available as confirmation of the same,” GCZMA has said. Besides the public hearing on the CZMP, the state government had also called on citizens to write to the GCZMA with their objections and suggestions on the coastal plan. GCZMA therefore deliberated on these objections and suggestions at a recent meeting. GCZMA also said that it has received many objections on the ‘hazard line’ reflecting in the draft CZMP for Goa. The fears expressed by citizens was that the hazard line marked extends inland beyond the existing no development zone of CRZ. They sought to know from GCZMA if no developmental activities will be now permitted upto the hazard line from the shore. “In order to address the apprehensions of general public, it is decided to clarify that the hazard line is not a regulatory line, but a line depicted as a planning tool for disaster management purposes only,” GCZMA has stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/czmp-should-only-reflect-structures-on-foreshore/articleshow/81749840.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

BJP has also apologized to doctors’ associations, claiming an agency was in charge of the content and that they did not endorse the comment. The video, featuring a couple who lost their child, spoke about “mismanagement and corruption” that patients faced at state healthcare institutions. The couple in the video alleged that staff at hospitals—from doctors to ward boys—demanded bribe from them for the admission of their child. “We came across the video two days ago and raised our voice against such derogatory remarks. It undermines the toil doctors go through every day and tries to put a blanket blame on the fraternity. This is unacceptable and we protest that,” said Abhik Ghosh, secretary of a doctors’ organization, Protect The Warriors. “If you consider the Covid-19 situation, you can find hundreds of examples of selfless service by healthcare workers.” IMA West Bengal on Monday wrote to Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora, pointing out the video was “demeaning and defaming for the entire noble profession”. “We are condemning such feeling of hatred towards doctors and healthcare workers,” said Santanu Sen, state secretary of IMA West Bengal, which demanded immediate steps against it. Sen is also Trinamool’s Rajya Sabha MP. In the letter, Bengal IMA wrote that during the pandemic, healthcare professionals, including doctors, took the most possible risk to help mankind and till date, 750 doctors and hundreds of healthcare workers had died. The video clip was removed on Monday. “I have not seen it but I received complaints. I forwarded it to the higher leadership. I am told it was withdrawn after that,” said Samik Bhattacharya, Bengal BJP spokesperson. “It was on their FB page and we wrote a letter.

Saraswathi was interacting with reporters at Kovilpatti on Monday after offering prayers at the Shenbagavalli Poovanananthar temple along with Sasikala. Though Sasikala did not campaign for T T V Dhinakaran, thousands gathered to greet and welcome her. Saraswathi added that Sasikala and Dhinakaran will emerge as strong leaders in Tamil Nadu. She said that Sasikala wanted everyone to stay together to defeat the DMK but chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami not only forgot being grateful to Sasikala but also went to the height of deceit. “They should think who was responsible for forming the government when she was convicted,” she said. The spokesperson said that the cooker symbol has reached the corners of the state and people are waving them from their homes everywhere like they did during the R K Nagar bypoll. On Dhinakaran contesting from Kovilpatti, she said that every constituency is the same for a leader and recalled Jayalalithaa contesting from Bargur, Andipatti and Srirangam before R K Nagar. Earlier, Sasikala participated in the puja at the Sri Ramanathaswamy temple in Rameswaram. She was accompanied by nearly 200 people including AMMK candidates as she participated in the “Rudhra Parayana Jabam” with a group of 30 priests. A pot for which the rituals were performed was also handed over to Sasikala and she carried it to the sanctum sanctorum of the deity to worship.

The byelection was necessitated following the death of Narsimhaiah three months ago. Bhagat will file his nomination papers on Tuesday. TRS president and chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao handed over the B-form to Bhagat at Telangana Bhavan on Monday afternoon. He also gave a cheque for Rs 28 lakh to the party candidate towards campaigning expenses. Though the nomination process began on March 23, the ruling party did not announce the candidate’s name mainly to prevent poaching of its candidates by other parties, especially BJP. Before finalising Bhagat’s name, KCR held a meeting with Bhagat and Narsimhaiah’s wife Laxmi along with erstwhile Nalgonda district TRS leaders. He reportedly promised an MLC seat to MC Koti Reddy, who was an aspirant for the party ticket from Nagarjuna Sagar. Bhagat thanked the CM for reposing faith in him and his family. He said KCR recognised the services of his late father, who joined the TRS after quitting the CPM. The TRS candidate said over one lakh people are getting the benefits of various government schemes in the constituency and added that he does not foresee any threat from the BJP. Bhagat (37) is an engineering graduate and did his PG in law. He has been working for the TRS since 2014 along with his father. Before joining politics, he worked as a junior engineer and assistant manager in private firms between 2008 and 2012. Since then, he has been practising as an advocate.

After former chief minister Luizinho Faleiro discreetly pointed fingers at the party leadership for the sad state of affairs, Lok Sabha MP Francisco Sardinha came out guns blazing against Chodankar. Sardinha dropped all pretences as he candidly said that the path for Congress’ revival began with Chodankar being replaced by a “senior leader” who has a proven track record. “Girish has destroyed our party. What Luizinho had done, Girish has squandered. If he goes and a senior person comes in as a leader, the old Congress supporters will return to the party fold. Girish has to go in the interest of the party,” said Sardinha. Although the MP said he had nothing personal against Girish, it was interesting to note that he appeared to be subtly coming out in support of Faleiro, whose name has been doing the rounds as the next state Congress president. When TOI reached out to Faleiro, he said he did not wish to offer any comment as he did not want to interfere in the party’s organisational matters. In the aftermath of the Navelim zilla panchayat elections, Coutinho had lashed out at Faleiro and opposition leader Digambar Kamat, blaming them for her defeat. While Faleiro did not directly respond to Coutinho’s charge, he did say he felt “sad and bad” about the party’s repeated electoral losses and the exit of party functionaries. A senior Congress functionary who is known to be close to Chodankar said the electoral losses had given some MLAs ammunition to once again target the state Congress president. Sardinha has blamed Chodankar for giving undue importance to former Congress office-bearers such as Urfan Mulla and Coutinho. “Our president made these people big leaders and that is why they got so much importance. We need leaders not who talk but who do work and rise up,” said Sardinha. Chodankar refused to be drawn into the debate, but said that such mudslinging in public was demoralising for the party workers. Responding to a statement by Faleiro that 13 MLAs have left the Congress since he stepped down as state party president, Chodankar reportedly said that ten MLAs had quit when the Navelim MLA was Congress chief minister of the state. “I have seen the worst days of Congress where the party was left with just four MLAs when the Luizinho Faleiro government was toppled. There is an inbuilt capability within the party to bounce back, but first we have to win the trust of the people,” he said. If he remains party president, Chodankar will be firm on fielding “80% young and new faces” for the 2022 assembly elections. After recently losing the Navelim zilla panchayat election, Coutinho joined the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-poll-defeats-congmen-gun-for-chodankar/articleshow/81749843.cms||---

The objective of the two bills is to empower the state election commission (SEC) to undertake the reservation process for local body elections. Currently, the powers to undertake reservation of wards for panchayat and municipal elections are vested with the director of panchayats and the director of municipal administration respectively. The focus of the two bills, said GFP functionaries, is to give powers to the state election commission instead of directors of the panchayat and DMA with respect to reservations to be done. Sardesai informed Speaker Rajesh Patnekar that he intends to introduce the Goa Municipalities (Amendment Bill) 2021 and the Goa Panchayat Raj (Amendment) Bill during the on-going assembly session. GFP’s move comes in the backdrop of the litigation surrounding the reservation and delimitation process for the municipal elections. A clutch of petitions filed by Goan residents, including candidates backed by the Congress and GFP, before the high court of Bombay at Goa challenging the process which the high court quashed. The Goa government had moved Supreme Court against a ruling of the high court which had quashed an order of the Goa government determining the reservation of seats in wards of five of the 11 municipal councils. While quashing the reservation process, the high court had observed that “gross illegalities” were committed and had directed the director for municipal administration to rework the reservation process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-forward-to-table-2-bills-in-house-to-empower-sec/articleshow/81749845.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Madurai||Court dismisses pleas against ESZ around wildlife sanctuary||Madurai: The Madras high court has dismissed a batch of petitions challenging the central government’s gazette notification declaring an eco-sensitive zone (ESZ) around Kanyakumari Wildlife Sanctuary.A division bench of justices M M Sundresh and S Ananthi observed that on a perusal of the final notification, they find that clear extent has been given at various directions of protective areas. It also deals with the preparation of zonal master plan for the eco-sensitive zone. This can only be done after consultation with the local people. It is absolutely wrong to state that the ongoing agricultural operations and other activities will be put on hold.The judges observed that as submitted by the central and state governments, what is proposed is, only regulations and not prohibitions. “The day-to-day life of the general public will not be affected. In fact, it only help them. Protecting the environment is the duty of one and all. In fact, we are not protecting the environment, but minimizing its damage,” they said.The judges observed that the notification itself takes care of all contingencies. It involves a consultation process at the time of publication of the zonal master plan for eco-sensitive zone. It further provides for a monitoring committee for monitoring the notification.The judges said that the implementation is after a prolonged thought process and a procedure, involving further discussion and deliberation on various suggestions, intended to protect the sensitive ecology of the country.All these petitions have been filed on mere apprehension which do not have any legal or factual basis. The decision has been made by a committee of experts. “When such a decision is made and in the absence of any malice in law, we cannot interfere with the same in exercise of powers conferred under Article 226 of the Constitution,” they said.Dismissing the petitions, the judges also said that it is always open to the aggrieved people, including the petitioners, to seek redressal after the zonal master plan is published, which is required to take into consideration the various factors, not only from the point of view of environment, but also the general public.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/court-dismisses-pleas-against-esz-around-wildlife-sanctuary/articleshow/81749847.cms||Kaushik Kannan

The average number of daily recoveries between March 22 and 28 in Nashik city increased to 1,444 week — a significant jump from the average daily recovery figure of 364 between March 15 and 21. The city had registered an average of 170 daily Covid recoveries between March 1 and 7, and rose to 236 between March 8 and 14. The rising number of daily recoveries expectedly coincides with the surge in the daily number of identified Covid-19 cases. The average daily Covid positive case-count was 263 in the first week of March. This increased to 1,211 by the third week of March, and subsequently to 1,604 between March 22 and 28. Most of the recovered patients are asymptomatic or had mild symptoms. The recovery period of a Covid patients is around 12 days. “The per-day patient count increased over the past two-three weeks. These patients are now in recovery, That is the reason why the daily recovery figures have increased,” said Kalpana Kute, a senior health officer of the Nashik Municipal Corporation. Moreover, the NMC has also decided to use its two sports stadiums to set up Covid care centres (CCCs). Last week, the NMC reopened the CCC at a hostel building of the social welfare department near the Dwarka area. This CCC has 500 beds. But given the continuous rise in the number of new cases, Nashik municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav has directed the civic officials to increase the number CCCs in the city. The NMC commissioner has directed two divisional officers to inspect the stadiums and find out how many beds can be set up there. “While one stadium is in Panchavati, the other is in Cidco division,” said Kute. “A CCC with 200 beds is to be reopened at the Panjabrao Deshmukh hostel in the Meri area in a day or two. Another CCC at Thakkar’s Dome is also to be reopened soon,” added Kute.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashiks-recovery-figures-temper-covid-case-surge/articleshow/81748097.cms||Tushar Pawar

Elections to the posts have been scheduled for Tuesday. Rohit on Monday filed his nomination for mayor and Agshikar for deputy mayor. TOI was the first to report that Rohit would be the next mayor of the state capital. Rohit told reporters that he was grateful for the trust of the people. “Once the council is set, we will list the priorities that we promised in the election and will accomplish them as soon as possible,” he said. Agshikar thanked BJP and the Panaji MLA for giving him a second opportunity to serve to the people of Panaji. By putting his son at the helm of the CCP, Monserrate has sent out a clear signal to BJP that when it comes to Tiswadi, it will be him who’ll call the shots. His wife Jennifer, the MLA of Taleigao, is already a minister in the Pramod Sawant cabinet. Last week, Monserrate said he would win all five seats for BJP in the Tiswadi taluka at the forthcoming assembly elections. All five seats are currently represented by BJP, though in 2019 three of them — Taleigao, Santa Cruz and St Andre — belonged to Congress. When asked whether BJP was promoting ‘family raj’ by nominating Rohit as mayor, party state president Sadanand Shet Tanavade said the corporators’ decision was unanimous. “I should be asked this question when I distribute tickets during the assembly election,” he said. Surendra Furtado convener of the ‘We Ponjekar’ panel that won three seats, said they did not contest the elections for mayor and deputy mayor because the Monserrate-backed panel had the numbers on its side.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rohit-set-to-be-panaji-mayor-today-agshikar-deputy/articleshow/81749857.cms||---

While police said Naskar had not taken permission for her rally, they were non-committal about cops allegedly shoving the barricades.  “I’m not aware of FIR.

Ahead of the assembly elections, political parties are organising several public meetings and processions across the state. People participating in such meetings are not properly following the Covid-19 protocol such as wearing masks and maintaining physical distancing.Since it would pave way for the increase in the number of Covid-19 cases, such meetings where people gather in large numbers should not be permitted by the authorities. Though he sent a representation to the authorities in this regard and to take steps to prevent the spread, there was no response.Hence, the petitioner moved the HC Madurai bench seeking the district administration and local bodies in the state to take effective steps to prevent the control of Covid-19 in the state. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-seeks-response-from-tn-to-prevent-spread-of-covid-19/articleshow/81749855.cms||---

It is an election where the religious and casteist parties with dangerous principles are aligning together with the hunger to rule the state. So, people should understand the forces and vote accordingly,” Thirumavalavan said. “They (BJP) will not talk about the grievances of the people of Tamil Nadu, they will not talk about their drinking water issues or absence of road facilities to crematoriums and social justice in the state. They do not even care about the Hindus who are in hunger, nor their basic rights. But their speeches are to divide Hindus from Christians and Muslims under the guise of safeguarding Hindus and their rights,” the VCK leader charged.The Tamil soil, which was protected by late leaders Periyar, C N Annadurai and M Karunanidhi should not be trapped by caste fanatics and should not fall prey to their target. To prevent this, DMK president M K Stalin should be made the chief minister of Tamil Nadu, Thirumavalavan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/assembly-election-is-a-battle-against-the-bjp-says-vck-leader/articleshow/81750768.cms||---

According to the construction and demolition waste management rules 2016, waste generated under a particular local body should be processed and disposed safely. In Madurai, the construction debris can be seen accumulated at four designated places -- Gatelock Road, Masthanpatti, Vellaikkal and Vilangudi. An official from the corporation said that since the proposals reached the civic body after the model code of conduct came into effect, they have been set aside. They will go through the proposals and seek project details once the election is over.“We will obtain all the details such as the nature of the project, methodology to be used to process the waste and how they intend to generate money out of it. The project should also comply with the Tamil Nadu pollution control board norms,” he said. The selected company will have to set up the facility required for processing at their own cost and can own and operate for the first five years, after which it will be taken over by the civic body, the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madurai-corporation-gets-eoi-to-process-construction-debris/articleshow/81749861.cms||V Devanathan

During a meeting in the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) headquarters, the commissioner gave this direction. This action comes as some restaurants, hotels and bars are still violating the Covid safety protocols despite the warnings issued. “Many hotels and bars are found flouting the norms despite warnings given several times. Many of them are still not maintaining social distancing,” said Kalpana Kute, the senior health officer of NMC. Around a couple of weeks ago, Jadhav had visited some hotels and restaurants to ensure they are following the Covid norms. He had slapped fine of Rs 5,000 each to around five to six hotels and restaurants during his surprise visits. On Saturday, a squad of NMC officials had sealed an overcrowded hotel and no social distancing was maintained. NMC had also warned hotels and bars to maintain social distancing and other government guidelines several times. But in vain as some continue to violate the guidelines. Meanwhile, the NMC commissioner has increased the fine amount for not wearing masks in public places from Rs 200 to Rs 5,000. In February, NMC had increased the fine from Rs 200 to Rs 1,000 following the directive of district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal. But after the feedback from the officials in the squads and police officials, NMC had reduced the fine to Rs 200 around a fortnight ago. But NMC has increased the fine again as a section of city residents is still not wearing masks even with the increase in cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/civic-chief-directs-sealing-of-hotels-bars-for-overcrowding/articleshow/81748099.cms||Tushar Pawar

The municipalities that will go to the polls are Margao, Mormugao, Mapusa, Sanguem and Quepem. Sources said that the date will be announced as there has to be a gap of 21 days between the date of notification and the poll date. More importantly, the Supreme Court has directed the SEC to complete the election process by April 30. In the elections held for for seven urban local bodies (ULB), including the Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP), BJP had swept the polls. The six municipalities that had elections are Valpoi, Bicholim, Pernem, Cuncolim, Canacona and Curchorem-Cacora. On February 22, the SEC said that elections to the CCP and 11 municipal councils will take place on March 20. But the elections were kept in abeyance soon after the high court cancelled the election in five municipalities over the reservation of wards. On March 4, within hours of the Supreme Court staying the high court order cancelling elections to five municipalities over reservation of wards, the SEC rescheduled polling for five civic councils to March 21. On March 12, in a stinging rebuke to the Goa government for giving its law secretary additional charge of the SEC, the Supreme Court upheld the Bombay high court’s order setting aside a notification for holding elections in five municipalities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/election-date-for-5-civic-councils-to-be-out-today/articleshow/81749858.cms||---

The NIA is currently probing the case involving alleged planting of gelatin sticks in an SUV that was found parked near the house of businessman Mukesh Ambani. Earlier this month, the probe agency arrested Mumbai crime intelligence unit's assistant inspector and encounter specialist Sachin Waze for his alleged role in the case. Waze is lodged in NIA custody and is being questioned for his alleged role in the suspicious death of Thane-based businessman Mansukh Hiran. Already Maharashtra anti terrorism squad has claimed to have detected the Hiran death case and named Waze and two of others, including a constable convicted in Lakhan Bhaiya encounter case, as the key suspects. Vijay Nade, theowner of the car (a Maruti Eeco with registration number MH-20-DP-1539) that was stolen from Aurangabad in November last year, is a clerk with the Social Justice Department in the neighbouring Jalna district. Soon after his car was stolen from Uddhavrao Patil Chowk on November 16, Nade had lodged a complaint with the City Chowk police station in Aurangabad. The police were unable to trace the car over the last four months. Nade, a resident of Chatrapati Nagar, said that he was stunned after his stolen car's registration number plates were found by NIA. “I learnt about it only after I started receiving calls from journalists asking the whereabouts of the car registered in my name. Today (Monday) morning I reached out to the police and demanded a probe about it.” City Chowk police station's inspector Sambhaji Pawar told TOI, “Based on the complaint lodged by Vijay Nade, we had registered a theft case. The case till date has remained undetected. We will communicate with the authorities there to find out if the car stolen from Aurangabad was used there, or if it was only the number plate that was used.” The officer said that a B-final has already been filed in the court, and the possibility of reopening the vehicle theft case, cannot be ruled out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/2-number-plates-found-in-mithi-river-belong-to-car-stolen-in-nov-2020/articleshow/81749893.cms||Mohammed Akhef

---||Mumbai||Sharad Pawar-Amit Shah meeting rumours swirl despite NCP, Sanjay Raut denial||MUMBAI: Speculation about the purported meeting between Union home minister Amit Shah and NCP leaders Sharad Pawar and Praful Patel in Ahmedabad continued to swirl a day after Shah cryptically said “everything need not be made public,” with Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut first confirming the meeting on Monday morning and later denying it and BJP state chief Chandrakant Patil indicating there was nothing unusual about such a meeting. Asked about the meeting, Raut initially said, “Why worry? Can’t a senior MP meet the home minister?” By 2 pm on Monday, however, he had put out a tweet categorically denying any such secret meeting had taken place. Though NCP has denied the meeting took place, the buzz has gained traction as it comes amid tensions in the Maha Vikas Aghadi over controversies the state government is embroiled in. Referring to the Pawar-Shah meeting speculation, Patil on Monday said, “A meeting does not necessarily have to be to discuss politics. It can go beyond politics.” Raut had in his column in the Sena mouthpiece Saamna on Sunday called NCP’s Anil Deshmukh an “accidental home minister,” and tensions between NCP and Sena have been escalating ever since the MVA government has been at the receiving end of opposition attacks after a car laden with explosives was found outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s house, the murder of Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran, the arrest of disgraced cop Sachin Waze and allegations of extortion and corruption made by former city police chief Param Bir Singh against Deshmukh. The unease over Raut’s criticism of Deshmukh also deepened on Monday with leaders of both Congress and NCP saying he had “exceeded his brief” and Congress minister Balasaheb Thorat saying his party would bring the matter to the notice of CM Uddhav Thackeray. Raut had, among other things, written that the MVA government had no mechanism for damage control and thus had faced huge embarrassment after Singh alleged Deshmukh had given Waze a target of mobilizing Rs 100 every month. Thorat, who is revenue minister, said, “Raut’s comments are uncalled for and in bad taste. We will take it up with the CM. In the past too, Raut had passed critical remarks against Indira Gandhi and was reprimanded. We feel that at a juncture when the government is moving smoothly, prominent leaders should observe restraint. Raut must realize he is also a part of the MVA.” Expressing his displeasure, state NCP president and water resources minister Jayant Patil said, “As an editor, he (Raut) has freedom to write, but at the same time, he must realize he is also a Shiv Sena leader.” Former speaker and state Congress president Nana Patole repeated his accusation that Raut was “a spokesperson for Sharad Pawar.” Patole said, “We believe that whatever Raut writes has the endorsement of the NCP leadership. Even on the alleged meeting between Pawar and Shah, Raut was the first to deny it while Pawar and Praful Patel have not tweeted on the row. We feel the NCP leadership was aware of whatever he has written on Deshmukh.” NCP has denied that Pawar met Shah, saying it was “a BJP conspiracy.” However, Patole said there was no threat to the stability of the MVA government. “Our government is all a game of numbers. Even if a few legislators defect to another party, the MVA government will have a clear majority,” he said. Thorat said Deshmukh is among the important cabinet members. “He was instrumental in management of the pandemic and effectively dealt with the case against Arnab Goswami and the suicide case of Dadra-Nagar Haveli MP Mohan Delkar,” he noted. A senior NCP cabinet minister said Raut had written the article in anticipation of Deshmukh’s removal from the cabinet. “Raut expects that in view of inept handling of the law and order situation, Sharad Pawar may sack Deshmukh from the cabinet, and Raut would be able to take credit for the dismissal,” the minister said. NCP spokesperson and skill development minister Nawab Malik called Raut’s remarks “unfortunate.” “With the experience of more than 18 years as a cabinet member, Deshmukh’s performance is impressive. There has been no dereliction of duty at any stage. We take Raut’s criticism in a positive manner. Raut must have written it in his capacity as editor of a newspaper and not as a Shiv Sena leader,” Malik said. Sena spokesperson and transport minister Anil Parab and home minister Deshmukh declined comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/pawar-shah-meeting-rumours-swirl-despite-ncp-raut-denial/articleshow/81750977.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

In the Nashik district alone, the number of active Covid cases has breached the 1,000-mark in three talukas for the first time now since the beginning of the outbreak about a year ago because of a ramped up testing drive.Testing in the rural areas has gone up from about 900 individuals per day to almost 3,500 daily tests now. Each taluka, on average, conducts 300 daily tests.Currently, there are 8,424 active cases in the rural areas of Nashik district. Of them, 3000 cases are in the three talukas of Niphad, Nandgaon and Deola alone. Niphad taluka has the highest number of active cases (1,083), closely followed by Nandgaon (1,017) and Deola (1,013). “Efforts are on to cut down on the infection spread. Most importantly, people must follow all Covid norms. Only after that will there be some respite,” said Dr Kapil Aher, the district health officer. He said his team was carrying out the process of testing, tracking and treating patients. “The other preventive measures can and should be carried out by the people,” the officer said. The officer said the number of cases in Deola taluka had risen in a short span of time. “This is because we have carried out intense testing in the containment zones of the villages. We gave priority to RT-PCR testing in the containment zones and antigen testing outside the containment zones,” the officer said. “The number in Niphad crossed the 1000-mark, but in Sinnar, there are 675 cases. It may be noted that in Niphad, the infection has reached the rural pockets while in Sinnar, the infection has been limited mostly to the urban areas,” Niphad sub-divisional officer Archana Pathare said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/with-increased-testing-3-nashik-talukas-report-1000-active-cases/articleshow/81748117.cms||Abhilash Botekar

Police said Sivamalai, 40, and Sivavelan, 37, were brothers who lived together. The elder brother, involved in astrology detected a treasure under the house with his powers. The brother and their friends, K Lakshmanan, 37, of Kumantha Nagar and M Nirmal Ganapathy, 17, of Pannamparai dug a 38-feet pit in the house floor for the past six months. The four of them and Sivavelan’s wife Ruba had entered the pit on Sunday, where they were later found unconscious. The Nazareth police rushed to the spot and retrieved them, but Lakshmanan and Nirmal Ganapthy had already died. The other three people were admitted to the Palayamkottai government hospital.

---||Madurai||Teacher’s postal ballot uploaded in social media, probe launched||Tenkasi: Police have registered a case and are investigating into violations of secrecy of ballot after a photo of a postal ballot paper with the vote cast of a school teacher was found posted on social media recently. The case was filed based on a complaint given by Congress candidate for Tenkasi assembly constituency, S Palani Nadar. While the teacher has feigned ignorance, it is suspected that another teacher might have been involved. The ballot paper, which belonged to a teacher from a government aided school in Tenkasi district was shared on Facebook and WhatsApp last week. Subsequently, the Tenkasi district chief educational officer recommended for her immediate suspension as of March 28. However, the teacher has claimed innocence and the Tamil Nadu Primary School Teachers Federation (TNPTF) too has come out in support of her, noting that she did not have a social media account and that someone else had posted the photo in their account. A case has been registered with the police due to violation of secrecy of ballot under various sections of the Representation of the People (RP) Act and Information Technology (IT) Act. Investigation revealed that another teacher from the school might have been involved in the misdeed. “It is a stray incident but it is being taken very seriously. Investigation is still underway and we will get the full picture of what exactly happened soon. The teacher has been temporarily stopped from election duty but has not been suspended. If she is found innocent, she will continue on election duty and strict action will be taken against those responsible,” said Tenkasi district collector and district election officer, G S Sameeran. Tenkasi SP is expected to submit a detailed report to the collector in one or two days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/teachers-postal-ballot-uploaded-in-social-media-probe-launched/articleshow/81749957.cms||---
---||Nashik||Maharashtra: Shirdi Sai temple visit time reduced||NASHIK: The Shri Saibaba Sansthan Trust (SSST), Shirdi, has reduced the daily temple visiting hours for devotees, with immediate effect, as the state government has imposed fresh restrictions in the wake of a surge in Covid-19 cases. In a statement, the trust said the devotees will be allowed to visit the temple between 7.15 am and 7.45 pm only. Earlier, the devotees were allowed between 6 am and 9 pm. The Sai prasadalaya, where devotees are provided free food, will now be operational between 10 am to 7.30 pm. “Although the early morning and late night aartis would continue to take place, devotees will not be allowed to attend these two events,” said the statement. The state government has imposed 8 pm-7 am restrictions making it mandatory for all shops and establishments — barring those providing essential goods and services — to shut down. The state government has also banned gathering of more than five people at public places. “We appeal to the devotees to strictly adhere to Covid-appropriate behaviour to prevent the spread of the infection,” said the trust officials. Adequate temple staff have been deployed to conduct thermal screening of devotees and to ensure the devotees wear masks and maintain physical distance within the temple complex. Religious places were shut down last year when the pandemic was at its peak. The Sai temple had only reopened for devotees on November 16, 2020, and the temple management had put several measures in place to ensure people with Covid-like symptoms are not allowed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/shirdi-sai-temple-visit-time-reduced/articleshow/81748135.cms||---

The incident left four policemen seriously injured, while several two-wheelers and four-wheelers were damaged. The incident took place on Monday evening, when the Nanded police, led by superintendent of police Pramod Kumar Shewale, put up barricades at the entrance of Gurdwara Hujur Sahib. Shewale said that due to a surge in Covid-19 cases in Nanded district, the permission for the Halla Bol was denied. On the occasion of Rang Panchanami, members of the Sikh community, holding traditional weapons including swords, run from the gurdwara to Nagin Ghat, about 1,500m away. Several members of the community were upset when they could not take part in the Halla Bol. Anticipating law and order situation, heavy police bandobast was deployed in the area. Nanded range DIG Nisar Tamboli said: “Efforts were made by our officers to convince the gathering to abstain from taking out the procession, but some of the youths became violent and brought down the barricades.” The officer said that based on the videos of the incident, an FIR is being registered at the Wazirabad police station and all those involved in attacking the police will face action.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/no-permission-for-halla-bol-sparks-violence/articleshow/81749949.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Mumbai||Holidays may help reduce Covid spread in Mumbai, say experts||MUMBAI: Could this holiday-laced week help control the spread of Covid-19 in the city? Experts such as Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state government’s task force on Covid-19, are hoping so. “The city needs a circuit-breaker to stop transmission of Covid-19. This week, Holi and Good Friday holidays could act as the much-needed circuit-breaker,’’ Dr Joshi said. Banks too will remain open only for three days (March 30, 31 and April 3) because of public holidays and annual closure, according to United Forum on Bank Unions. “All this will lead to less interaction between people, with less chance of spreading Covid-19 infection,’’ said a doctor. The second wave of Covid-19 in Mumbai (and Maharashtra) is being blamed on poor Covid-appropriate behavior: People have not been using masks or maintaining social distance. Although chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday directed chief secretary S Kunte to prepare for a lockdown, a review of Covid is likely on April 2.  Many officials said a complete lockdown like last March is unlikely. “We may have restrictions such as certain offices operating from home or close down restaurants for few days,’’ said a BMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/holidays-may-help-reduce-covid-spread-in-mumbai-say-experts/articleshow/81750803.cms||---
---||Mumbai||HC denies civil surgeon bail in harassment case in Mumbai||MUMBAI: Bombay high court rejected pre-arrest bail to a civil surgeon who had held the hand of a home guard against her wish in his cabin. Justice Sarang Kotwal rejected the anticipatory bail application by Shrimant Chavan, civil surgeon of Sindhudurg district, who was booked under IPC section 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty). The informant was on duty outside Chavan’s cabin at the Civil Hospital. The FIR said he used to call her inside the cabin on some pretext or other and touch her inappropriately while handing articles. On the day of the particular incident, he called her to the cabin, held her hand and expressed his fondness for her. He also threatened to sack her if she discussed this with anyone else. The judge found “no force” in the submission by Chavan’s advocate Aniket Nikam that there was no criminal force involved. Nikam contended as per the allegation, Chavan had only taken her hand in his hand and that did not mean her movement was restricted. “In the incident in his cabin, the informant’s hand was taken in his hand. The informant’s movement was restricted against her wish. This has to be seen in the background that the applicant had threatened the victim that he would remove her from the job,” said Justice Sarang Kotwal on March 23, adding these two aspects considered together make an offence under section 354. Prosecutor Pallavi Dabholkar said conversations recorded by the informant reveal Chavan was making advances towards her. She further said “10 other victims” have similar grievances. Justice Kotwal took note of conversations before the actual incident. On February 22, Chavan called her up at 10.15 pm. “The applicant had no business to make phone calls after her duty hours. All these conversations indicate that the applicant was trying to get over- friendly with the informant and his advances were specifically discouraged by the informant. On February 6 he had, in fact, called her to his quarters. This behaviour of the applicant is totally unacceptable,” said Justice Kotwal, adding Chavan’s persistent attempts led to the incident related in the FIR. He also said it cannot be ignored that Chavan was “occupying a position where he wanted his employees to accede to his unreasonable and illegal demands.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/hc-denies-civil-surgeon-bail-in-harassment-case-in-mumbai/articleshow/81749967.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Madurai||Voluntary Covid-19 tests not as high as last year||Madurai: Even as Covid-19 cases continue to rise in the district, with around 30-40 cases being recorded per day, private labs which perform Covid-19 testing reported that the number of those getting tests has not increased unlike previously when cases were rising. Lab technicians and doctors said there is reluctance among the public to get Covid-19 tests. “There is no unusual increase in those getting Covid-19 tests. But, even then the number of those getting the tests is nowhere close to what was being recorded 5-6 months ago. Further, hardly 10% of those getting tests come forward voluntarily if they suspect having symptoms for random testing,” said a lab technician at a private diagnostic lab. As per district health officials, around 2,500 tests are being done daily in government and private facilities. In private hospitals which have Covid-19 testing facilities as well, only few are coming forward for testing. “Every day, we find around 4-5 patients who come in for other illnesses test positive. However, generally there is reluctance among patients to get Covid-19 tests as they want to believe they don’t have it,” said Dr B Kannan, medical administrator, Meenakshi Mission Hospital and Research Centre. Previously, all inpatients - those undergoing surgeries and pregnant women awaiting delivery - had to undergo mandatory Covid tests. A senior doctor at another private multi-speciality hospitals also pointed out that it has been difficult to convince patients and their kin to get Covid-19 tests, but many undergoing surgeries turn out to be positive when they are tested. “With cases not being so high as last year, there is a carefree attitude among public. There is also misconception prevailing that it is only like a normal cold or viral fever and recovery is easy. Most of the patients who visit the hospital already have existing illnesses as well so it is irresponsible to ignore recommendation from physicians for testing,” added the doctor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/voluntary-covid-19-tests-not-as-high-as-last-year/articleshow/81749959.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

---||Hyderabad||Sagar bypoll: Too many candidates may spoil Congress, BJP plans||HYDERABAD: A number of independents and candidates from smaller parties have the potential to spoil the plans of the Congress and the BJP in the Nagarjuna Sagar Assembly byelections on April 17. Already 22 candidates, including seven from registered smaller parties like Samajwadi Forward Block, Anna YSR Congress, Telangana Sakala Janula party and independents have filed nominations. At least two more nominations will be filed on Tuesday which include Nomula Bhagat of the TRS and K Jana Reddy of the Congress. There is also a possibility of a few more independents entering the electoral fray. In the 2018 Assembly polls, 15 candidates had contested from this constituency. Political analysts said it will be an advantage to the ruling party if too many candidates remain in the electoral fray after the last date for withdrawal of nominations on April 3. It happened in the recent MLC  wherein anti-TRS vote got divided among too many candidates from smaller parties and popular independents. In fact, independent candidate Teenmar Mallanna gave a tough fight to Palla Rajeshwar Reddy in Nalgonda-Warangal-Khammam constituency. He finished runners-up, followed by Telangana Jana Samithi president M Kodandaram in the third place. Both these candidates shared 2.50 lakh votes between them. The BJP and Congress were reduced to fourth and fifth places. Rajeshwar Reddy of TRS won the seat with the help of second preference votes. In the 2018 elections in Nagarjuna Sagar Assembly constituency, Samajwadi Forward Bloc candidate polled 9819 votes and the BSP candidate polled nearly 1,000 votes. The victory margin of Nomula Narsimhaiah of TRS was 7771 votes against K Jana Reddy of the Congress. Kakatiya University political science professor (retired) B Sanjeeva Reddy said in a procedural democracy, every party and candidate have the right to contest, but it is also a fact that too many cooks spoil the broth. Whenever a political party, especially the ruling one, smells of backlash from the voters, it resorts to such tactics by encouraging independent candidates with potential to split the anti-incumbency vote, to enter the electoral fray. “One cannot rule out the possibility of a repeat of anti-TRS vote being split among too many candidates, even in the ensuing by-poll to the Nagarjuna Sagar constituency,” Sanjeeva Reddy said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/too-many-candidates-may-spoil-cong-bjp-plans/articleshow/81749970.cms||Roushan Ali

The KCCI directors were flooded with calls from traders asking whether to shut the shops at 8 pm or continue till 11 pm as per the earlier order. The KCCI directors approached the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) officials who said the shops must shut down by 8 pm as the prohibitory orders come into force after that.Sanjay Shete, the president of KCCI, said: “As per the order, all establishments have been asked to remain shut, apart from the establishments providing essential services. We expected clear directions on shops and markets. However, we have appealed to traders to shut the shops after 8 pm to avoid further restrictions. Also, the order has banned five or more persons from gathering and in case of shops, it becomes difficult to ensure no such gathering takes place.” When approached, collector Desai he said the shops should remain shut. When asked why there was no specific mention of shop timings, Desai said he has followed the state government’s ‘Mission Begin Again’ order. Also, Satara’s order explicitly mentions all non-essential shops should shut down after 8 pm. Sangli’s district’s order states all service providing establishments can remain open as per the earlier order. Abhijeet Chaudhary, the Sangli district collector, said, “I don’t expect the shops to remain shut after 8 pm. They usually shut by 9. Only the establishments where mass consumption takes place, such as restaurants, bars and malls, have to compulsorily shut down between 8 pm and 7 am.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/kolhapur-night-curbs-traders-told-to-shut-shops-by-8-pm/articleshow/81748148.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Candidate selection over but dissenters a cause for concern||HYDERABAD: With chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao zeroing in on Nomula Bhagat, the son of late Nomula Narasimhaiah, the hide-and-seek game between the TRS and the BJP came to an end. After enduring a bitter experience in the MLC elections when the TRS surprised everyone, particularly the BJP, by choosing PV Narasimha Rao’s daughter Surabhi Vani Devi as its candidate for the Mahbubnagar-Rangareddy-Hyderabad constituency, the saffron party played the waiting game. Only after Bhagat’s name was announced the BJP selected Dr Ravi Kumar Naik for the Nagarjuna Sagar bypoll. The BJP, in fact, don’t have a strong candidate to take on the likes of veteran legislator K Jana Reddy of the Congress or the might of the ruling party. The party even pondered over fielding actress Vijayashanti and Congress MLA Komatiredy Rajagopal Reddy. Despite being a Congress MLA, the latter gave enough hints that he is moving towards the BJP. Interestingly, the TRS was a bit worried as two of its leaders, with significant influence, had aspired for the ticket. Koti Reddy, a close associate of minister Jagadeeswar Reddy, and Tera Chinnapa Reddy tried hard to secure the party candidature till the last minute. Sources in the BJP told TOI that TRS decided to field Bhagat but waited till the end as they feared rebellion from Koti Reddy. “TRS certainly scored over us again. They managed to pacify the dissenters. But their moves will not deter us from working hard. We have been focusing on the important issues,” the source said. The BJP is not bereft of internal squabbles. The party was disappointed after their leader K Nivedita Reddy filed her nomination even before the candidature of Ravi Kumar was announced. Many workers are supporting Nivedita and feel she could have fetched more votes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/candidate-selection-over-but-dissenters-a-cause-for-concern/articleshow/81749986.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Mumbai||‘Had warned govt leaders against reinstating Sachin Waze’||MUMBAI: Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut said on Monday he had “warned a few leaders” of the MVA against reinstating Sachin Waze in the police force and that he had told them “it could create problems for the MVA government considering Waze’s behaviour and style of functioning”, reports Sujit Mahamulkar. The assistant inspector has been arrested in both the threat to industrialist Mukesh Ambani case and the Mansukh Hiran death case. Though he refused to name the leaders, Raut told TV channels he was “around” when discussion on reinstating Waze had taken place and added that “these leaders and some prominent figures” know about it. Waze, suspended for 17 years in the Khwaja Yunus custodial death case, was reinstated by the MVA regime last year. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had, while backing Waze during the session of the state legislature early this month, had asked if Waze was Osama bin Laden. Subsequently, Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamna had in its editorial also backed Waze, saying he and his team had exposed the TRP scam and arrested Arnab Goswami and it was because of that that the Centre had arrested him. Saamna had also stated that Waze’s arrest was an insult of the Maharashtra police. Raut is executive editor of Saamna; Uddhav’s wife Rashmi Thackeray is the editor. Raut defended Thackeray on Monday and said, “CM Thackeray’s statement was based on the information he received at that time, and his stand was correct. However, as Waze’s activities have surfaced, there is no reason to shield him. Thackeray was of the opinion that one should not be hanged before an inquiry is conducted.” Waze, a suspended assistant police inspector, is currently in NIA custody for placing an explosives-laden vehicle near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence. The National Investigation Agency is also investigating the death of vehicle owner Mansukh Hiran who was acquainted with Waze. Raut said, “During my initial days, I have worked as a crime reporter and have been working as a journalist for many years, so I know a few things. But unfortunately, things have happened. Basically, any officer as a person is not bad, but the prevailing situation makes him so.” He added, “The whole episode went ahead… no one could have controlled the situation… but the state government and many ministers have learnt a lesson from the incident, and I hope whatever happens, happens for the good.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/had-warned-govt-leaders-against-reinstating-waze/articleshow/81751001.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar
---||Mumbai||Five years’ rigorous imprisonment for PF officer who amassed Rs 33 lakh wealth||MUMBAI: A CBI court recently convicted and sentenced a 54-year-old Regional Employees Provident Fund Organization (EPFO) officer to five years’ rigorous imprisonment for amassing assets worth nearly Rs 33.3 lakh, disproportionate to his known sources of income. Vinayak Sonawane, who was an area enforcement officer with EPFO, was apprehended in 2014 for allegedly accepting a bribe of Rs 13 lakh, and was fined Rs5,000. The CBI special public prosecutor Sandeep Singh cited deposition of 17 witnesses to seek Sonawane’s conviction. Special CBI judge A S Sayyad directed that under Prevention of Corruption Act provisions, disproportionate assets of nearly Rs 33.3 lakh are to be recovered from him through his movable and immovable properties. “When he came up with the stand that his family’s total income during the check period was of Rs 27 lakh, the burden is on him to discharge it with cogent, consistent and corroborative evidence,” the judge said. “It appears that except a bare statement regarding his defence, nothing produced on record shows that during the period his income was Rs 27 lakh,” the judge added. The court excluded a house constructed in Nashik in 1994. Referring to loan documents, it observed that the CBI wrongly considered the house as par of disproportionate assets. The prosecution submitted that after Sonawane was booked in the bribery case, during investigations, it was found that between 2011-14, he acquired movable and immovable assets of more than Rs 40 lakh against likely savings of Rs 6.8 lakh.  It said Sonawane could not give a satisfactory answer on how he acquired the wealth.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/5-years-rigorous-imprisonment-for-pf-officer-who-amassed-rs-33l-wealth-in-mumbai/articleshow/81749988.cms||Rebecca Samervel

The names of those who refuse admission are emailed to the district collector, and they choose either home isolation or the Covid care centre at their own risk.The average daily admissions to the hospital, which hovered between five to eight patients last month, has now risen to 14. Its active cases have also doubled. Until last month, the hospital had an occupancy of around 40 cases. This number has risen to over 80 active cases.Most patients admitted are middle-aged. There are also some elderly persons, along with young people who have comorbidities.The hospital has patients in the ICU, in the obstetrics and gynaecology ward, as well as children in the paediatric ward.“Up to last month, there were around 100 patients admitted every two weeks,” a junion doctor told TOI. “We are now seeing 100 admissions every week. Cases are galloping. We are slowly returning to what we experienced in October.” The moderate to severe cases are treated at the hospital, while critical cases are referred to GMC.From panic admissions last year, people have come to take the pandemic lightly and even refuse admission, doctors say.“I feel people have lost their seriousness about Covid-19. You see huge crowds everywhere, whether at market places or festivals, where people don’t wear masks. We must treat this as a dangerous disease and win this war,” a doctor said.The recent elections also saw public figures flouting all Covid-19 protocols of wearing masks and following social distancing, putting several vulnerable people at risk.“We are a young population, and the bulk of those under the age of 45 hasn’t been vaccinated yet,” the doctor said. “We cannot be complacent until the vaccination is sorted out. There’s no point in getting Covid and creating unnecessary illnesses.” “It’s better to take care until everybody is vaccinated. Vaccination won’t prevent one from getting Covid, but will decrease the severity of the disease. It is the only alternative now, and has proved to be pretty safe in Goa and the rest of the country,” the doctor added.“Nurses and doctors are exhausted and physically and mentally drained,” another doctor said. “It’s time people become Covid warriors and put themselves in our shoes and give us a break.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/south-goa-dist-hosp-sees-rise-in-admissions/articleshow/81749992.cms||Lisa Monteiro

---||Pune||Over 300 teams for contact tracing||Pune: The civic body has deployed more than 300 teams to trace people in contact with Covid-19 patients and ensure effective detection and timely treatment. A minimum 21 teams will be at work in every civic ward office to trace such people and more teams will be deployed in accordance with the requirements. Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) authorities and experts have said efficient contact tracing reduces death rate.  The PMC’s average contact tracing per patient has been around 20. “Around 315 teams are active at present in various civic wards with a total strength of over 600 members. The number of teams can go up to 350. Additional teams will be deployed in areas reporting more cases,” a PMC official said. The teams identify the high- and low-risk contacts of the Covid-19 patients. Those with flu-like symptoms are told to undergo the Covid-19 tests. PMC assistant health chief Sanjeev Wavre said, “Our team members also counsel the family members, relatives and contacts about the precautions they need to follow. The citizens are also told to keep a track of their health.” Wavre said many cases, with very mild symptoms, during the contact tracing exercise and they have opted for home isolation. The administration has taken steps to set up Covid care centres for institutional quarantine of patients with mild symptoms. Medical practitioner Sunil Jagtap has been treating Covid-19 patients and feels that effective contact tracing is vital for early treatment and reducing chances of complications. “Many people have recovered well on getting timely treatment. Citizens have to remain alert. They cannot ignore their symptoms,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/over-300-teams-for-contact-tracing/articleshow/81749408.cms||Sarang Dastane
---||Mumbai||BMC hastened nod for deadly hospital in mall||MUMBAI: Last April, the BMC had created a WhatsApp group called ‘Revival Sunrise Hospital’ to fast-track approvals for Bhandup’s Sunrise Hospital located inside Dreams Mall. In fact, the application by Dr Nikita Trehan, director of Privilege Healthcare Services, to allow the hospital to start operations by way of a provisional occupation certificate (OC) was received on this WhatsApp group and processed by BMC’s building proposal (BP) department. Early on Friday, a major fire broke out in the mall and spread to the hospital located on the third floor. Over 70 patients were rescued and 11 bodies found. Times ViewCutting red tape and fast-tracking permissions is a welcome move but should not be done at the cost of safety rules and regulations. In the case of Sunrise Hospital in Dreams Mall, several aspects were ignored to allow the hospital to start and admit Covid-19 patients. Applications were made and processed via a WhatsApp group. The BMC probe must investigate if there were any lapses and strict action must be taken against those responsible.The fire was extinguished on Saturday--after 40 hours According to the final report prepared by sub-engineer Vijay Pawar (BP department) on May 1, 2020, a detailed request was sent to then BMC commissioner Praveen Pardeshi via email with the notesheet on the representation from Dr Trehan dated April 25, 2020, received on the WhatsApp group. In view of the pandemic, the BMC wanted to start the hospital as soon as possible and several mandatory requirements for grant of provisional OC were ignored in Sunrise’s case, which included unauthorised construction in shops on the first and second floors of the mall and reported FSI violation and unauthorised work carried out on the hospital premises on the third floor. The hospital management had requested that the mall irregularities be delinked from it for grant of provisional OC. However, the BMC delinked irregularities of the hospital premises too. “To delink the mezzanine work carried out in shops on lower floors. The work of the hospital portion is carried out without endorsement of commencement certificate. So this unauthorised work needs to be regularised by consuming any additional FSI if any, by duly obtaining permission for the same and by charging penalty towards regularisation,” Pawar’s report stated. BMC records also showed that the hospital management had claimed in the WhatsApp group that they had obtained consent from HDIL for provisional OC and they would need to consume additional FSI when they regularise any violations on the hospital premises. The management also stated that an administrator appointed by the National Company Law Tribunal was running the mall. “All hospital permissions and licences...are in order and have nothing to do with the mall compliances. We wish to clarify that Dreams Mall is being run by the administrator and the original owners, Rakesh and Sarang Wadhawan, were nowhere involved in the management... since 2018. It is written in the court order that the administrator is responsible for the hazards...Sunrise Hospital had filed a complaint against the administrator and appealed to police to take action against him,” the hospital stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bmc-hastened-nod-for-deadly-hospital-in-mall/articleshow/81751027.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Some of the warkari sansthas had decided to participate in the festival in large numbers and appealed to devotees across the state to support the movement. The police conducted meetings with various warkari sansthas in Alandi and Dehu before issuing the restriction order. Ramnath Pokale, the additional commissioner of the Pimpri Chinchwad police, told TOI, “The warkaris, who had called for the movement, submitted their application to us on Monday. They told us that their aim was to bring their issues to the government notice. They didn’t have any intention to violate the order and Covid norms at the venue.” Bandatatya Karadkar, who headed the group and initiated the “Chalo Dehu” movement, said, “The government has given permission to business establishments to open, but they didn’t think about Warkaris at all. We are still not allowed to hold weekly bhajan and kirtan programmes in villages. Besides, several restrictions have been imposed on our traditional events such annual wari to Pandharpur and Alandi.” The district administration has permitted only 50 people to participate in the Beej festival to perform rituals between March 28 and March 30. The event would culminate at the temple town of Dehu on Tuesday afternoon. Pokale said, “The residents and warkaris have responded positively to the order.

---||Hyderabad||Transstroy diverted Rs 7,000 crore: Enforcement Directorate||HYDERABAD: The Enforcement Directorate (ED), which is probing Transstroy (India) Ltd for its role in the multi-crore bank loan fraud, has zeroed in on the way the contractor of the mega Polavaram irrigation project had laundered Rs 7,153 crore. The Hyderabad-based infrastructure company is owned by former TDP MP Rayapati Sambasiva Rao. While scores of banks are waging legal battles to get back their Rs 10,115 crore given to Trasstroy in the form of loans, the ED in its probe has found out that Transstroy floated several firms exclusively for the purpose of diverting the money. Some of these firms are Subhakari Enterprises, Agastya Tradelinks, Padmavathy Enterprises, Rutvik Associates, Balaji Enterprises, Unique Engineers, AS Associates, etc., which were floated primarily to divert Rs 7,153 crore to Transstroy, the ED alleged. Directors of these firms are none other than employees of Transstroy itself, it said. When the ED looked into Transstroy’s accounts, it showed that its CMD Cherukuri Sridhar and Sambasiva Rao’s wife Leelavathy supplied Rs 450 crore to these companies to be shown as their share capital in the firms. Scores of fictitious transactions were carried out through these front companies only for the purpose of obtailing loans from the banks and to provide a legal cover to the diversion of the loans, the ED charged. The ED is currently probing the purpose behind floating of two more firms — Transstroy Singapore PTE Ltd and Transstroy Infra Australia Private Ltd. It also found that collaboration with Russian firms to execute the Polavaram mega project and their extension of technical expertise were bogus. “There is nothing on record to substantiate such claims made earlier by Transstroy,” the ED said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/transstroy-diverted-rs-7000-crore-ed/articleshow/81750074.cms||---

---||Delhi||LG in command in Delhi, all govt policy decisions will need his nod||NEW DELHI: With the amended GNCT of Delhi Act giving more powers to the lieutenant governor, all administrative decisions of the elected government may face delays. This is because all policy decisions would need the LG’s nod, which would take extra time and ultimately impact the people of Delhi. The move has already triggered a tussle between the AAP government and the Centre with some key schemes, like doorstep delivery of ration and change in excise policy, likely to become victims of the new administrative order. Delhi BJP has already urged the lieutenant governor to scrap both schemes. With the President giving his assent to the amended Act on Sunday, many in the Delhi administration believed that Tuesday was the first working day under the changed administrative setup. From now, all files would need to be sent to the LG for approval. An official said that the provisions of the amendment would come into force only after the central government notifies it in the official gazette.  The notification is expected to be issued soon. “Till the amendment is notified by the Centre, there is no need to send all files to the LG for his assent,” said a senior officer on anonymity. There is still ambiguity about the impact of the amendment on Delhi assembly and its committees.  The amendment states: “The legislative assembly shall not make any rule to enable itself or its committees to consider the matters of day-to-day administration of the capital or conduct inquiries in relation to the administrative decisions. Any rules made in contravention of this provision shall be void.” A source said the rules with regard to Delhi assembly may be included in the notification to clear the ambiguity. The LG may communicate with the assembly through a message to give effect to the amendments. “It is also not clearly defined as to what topics and issues will fall under the term ‘day-to-day administration’. An officer might say the issue for which he or she is being summoned by the assembly’s committees falls under this category, thereby making it beyond their preview. The departments also might make similar excuses upon being summoned by the committees,” added the source. The source further stated that the speaker was the final authority when it came to interpretation of the rules of procedure. “In case of difference of opinion, anyone going against his decision could invite privilege proceedings,” added the source. Gopal Rai, AAP’s Delhi convener, at a press conference said that Delhi government was taking legal opinion on the amendment and would take a final call accordingly. It may move Supreme Court in the matter, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/with-lg-in-command-work-may-get-delayed/articleshow/81768198.cms||AlokKNMishra

The nurse, working with Sassoon General Hospital, lodged a complaint with the Sangvi police. As per the complaint, the suspect also cheated her tenant of Rs1 lakh by promising him a job as an ambulance driver in the UK. The fraud occurred between February 20 and 22 this year. According to the complaint, the tenant introduced the complainant to the suspect and said he gave the man Rs1 lakh in cash and a cheque for Rs2 lakh. The suspect told the complainant he owns chemical plants in different states in India and that his wife was an ear surgeon at a London hospital.  “The suspect told me that there were two posts for Indian women vacant at this hospital and said I would have to pay Rs3.6 lakh for the visa and air tickets,” the complainant said. The following day, the nurse sent her documents to the suspect.  The same day, the man came to her house and told her arrange the money quickly as he was to leave for the UK on March 4. “He assured me his wife would make living arrangements for me in the UK,” she said. Between February 20 and February 22, the woman and her father-in-law transferred Rs 3.5 lakh to the suspect. “The suspect confirmed he got the money and told the nurse to apply for a passport,” a police officer said. From February 23, the man became unreachable. “He then sent a message saying he was travelling and that she would soon get an interview call,” the officer said. Soon, the woman’s tenant told her the man provided fake information and had cheated them both.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/nurse-falls-for-uk-job-bait-loses-rs-3-5-lakh-to-crook/articleshow/81749417.cms||Mihir Tanksale

This year too, though in low in number, students were still seen playing on the streets.Daily wage workers residing in the city including areas such as Nana Peth, Shaniwar Peth, and Narayan Peth were also seen indulging in the revelry with scant regard for social distancing norms.“Holi was not celebrated in public places. It was a curfew-like situation when we patrolled in the morning. We have intensified patrols during the day at all important places to ensure there were no law and order problems. We will take action under Section 188 (disobedience) of the Indian Penal Code if revellers are found flouting the state government directives,” Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/puneites-flout-safety-norms-to-celebrate-holi-in-different-areas/articleshow/81749415.cms||---

Tarachand Khandagale (47), a resident of Yamunanagar, lodged a complaint with the Airport police. He stated that he was waiting to catch a bus to his workplace at Mukundnagar in Swargate, when the two men arrived on a motorcycle. He was alone at the bus stop. “The duo accused Khandagale of stealing a diary of their ‘superior’,” senior inspector Gajanan Pawar said on Monday. Though the complainant protested his innocence, the suspects started to frisk him, Pawar said. “The suspects first removed Rs 500 in from Khandagale’s trouser pocket and returned it. They then spotted his gold chain, snatched it and fled towards Ahmednagar Road,” Pawar said. The complainant was too rattled to resist the suspects. Once he calmed down, he realised it was all a trick and approached the police. “We registered a case of robbery and impersonation under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code,” he further said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/duo-pose-as-cops-rob-commuter-of-gold-chain/articleshow/81749418.cms||Asseem Shaikh

A division bench of Chief Justice S Manikumar and Justice Shaji P Chaly gave the directive on a petition filed by opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala through advocate T Asaf Ali. After perusing details of multiple entries in the list produced by the petitioner, the court said it is of the prima facie view that there are discrepancies in the final voters' list published by the election commission. The presence of multiple entries will facilitate a person to vote twice, which is not permissible in law, it said. Election Commission's counsel Deepu Lal Mohan submitted that efforts are being taken to find out multiple entries in the voters' list. The court, however, said it is of the view that a voter should be permitted to cast only one vote, wherever his name is registered. "Accordingly, we direct and make it clear that the Election Commission of India should ensure that there is no double voting by any voter. Election Commission should also ensure that sufficient State/Central force is posted at all voting places, to ensure fair and democratic election. To implement the above, steps should be taken on a war footing basis," the order said. Further, the court said, "All possible steps should be taken to ensure that there is no double voting. Orders of this Court should be implemented in letter and spirit, without any room for complaint." It also ordered the election commission to file a counter affidavit by Tuesday, with supporting documents. The petition had alleged that there are multiple entries of voters in the list. It said 3,24,441 double votes and 1,09,601 bogus votes were found across 131 assembly constituencies in the final electoral roll published on January 20 but the election commission was not taking any action on it. Reacting to the interim order, Ramesh said the election commission should not have waited for someone to find the discrepancies. He said it took months to analyse the list and that is why he flagged the discrepancies at the eleventh hour. He alleged that the LDF had won the local body elections also with a rigged voters' list. "The CPM workers are behind this and it is done with the knowledge of chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/kerala/ensure-one-person-one-vote-in-kerala-hc-tells-ec/articleshow/81751209.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Human deaths, injuries dominant costs of human-wildlife conflict: Study||Nagpur: Scientists from the University of British Columbia (Canada) and the Centre for Wildlife Studies (India) have highlighted the significant human cost in the valuation of the damage incurred from conflict with wildlife in India. Krithi Karanth from CWS led the field surveys of 5,196 households living in a 10km buffer around 11 protected areas in four states of India (Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Maharashtra) between 2011 and 2014. Collaborating with Gulati and others from the University of British Columbia, they sought to estimate the human costs of conflict — damages to crop, livestock, and costs of human injury and death for the 15 most common wildlife species. Scientists also uncovered how these losses varied across different species and landscapes in the country. “We utilize data from a large survey conducted by CWS across several regions of India to present a comprehensive assessment of damage from the main wild species of India. Our study is also unique in explicitly valuing, incorporating and comparing the costs of human casualties to standard measures of losses in human property. Our results are statistically robust, and differentiate damage by individual species and regions,” says lead author Sumeet Gulati. “Human casualties contribute overwhelmingly to overall damages from wildlife interactions. This is despite the use of a relatively low valuation of human life from the literature. The dominance of the costs of human casualties rationalizes the innate fear and respect towards large charismatic species displayed by those living with wildlife in India,” Gulati says. The results of the study further imply that focusing on the cost of human casualties while estimating losses from wildlife conflict is necessary. Scientists also found that, in India, families are not being adequately compensated for the damage incurred from interactions with wildlife. The compensation for human death ranges from Rs 76,400 in Haryana, to Rs 15 lakh in Maharashtra. In India, the average compensation paid for human death is Rs 1.91 lakh and the average compensation paid for human injury is Rs 6,185. According to previous research by CWS in 2018, for human death the highest losses were reported in Assam (61 people), Karnataka (59 people), and Tamil Nadu (53), whereas no loss of life was reported in Arunachal Pradesh, Goa, Haryana, and Tripura for 2012–2013. The national average ex-gratia payment per human death incident was over Rs 2.37 lakh. In 2012–2013, the highest number of injuries was reported from Madhya Pradesh (2906), Maharashtra (463), Himachal Pradesh (455), and Chhattisgarh (407). The average ex-gratia payment per human injury incident was Rs 7,560. Karanth says, “Our research is one of the largest scientific assessments of human-wildlife conflict globally. We find that farmers experiencing a negative interaction with an elephant over the last year incur damages on average that are 600 and 900 times those incurred by farmers with negative interactions with the next most costly herbivore: the pig and the nilgai. Similarly, farmers experiencing a negative interaction with a tiger over the last year incur damage that is on average three times that inflicted by a leopard and a 100 times from a wolf.” “Particularly, a significant finding is that though a species is associated with a rare occurrence of human fatalities, the expected cost of death from a negative interaction is much higher than the expected cost of frequently occurring crop/livestock damage. Conservation managers have to prioritize human casualties and improve assistance provided to people,” adds Karanth, the co-author of the study. In conclusion, the study reiterates that conservation management efforts and policies should focus more on reducing human death and injuries from interactions with wildlife. This work was funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, by Oracle, the National Geographic Society, Columbia University, Duke University, and DST Ramanujan Fellowship. The study, titled ‘Human Casualties are the Dominant Cost of Human-Wildlife Conflict in India’, authored by Sumeet Gulati, Krithi K Karanth, Nguyet Anh Le and Frederik Noack, appeared in the journal - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS). CAUSE OF CONCERN * In India, inadequate state compensation a concern * Scientists from CWS and UBC Canada quantify losses from human casualties from conflict with 15 major wildlife species after surveying 5000 households across four states in India. * Scientists estimate losses from human casualties, crop, livestock and property losses using a conservative estimate for the value of a statistical life, a commonly used economic measure. * Research findings suggest focusing on reducing negative interactions particularly with charismatic species such as tigers, elephants, and leopards. * They also suggest a concerted management effort to reduce human fatalities, and lower animosity towards certain species in India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/human-deaths-injuries-dominant-costs-of-human-wildlife-conflict-study/articleshow/81763862.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Unpredictable poll battle in state’s northern border seat||If a candidate’s ability to handle multiple languages and dialects is a criterion for determining the winner in the elections, the most likely person to win the Manjeshwaram assembly constituency would be UDF candidate A K M Ashraf. The sheer easiness and verbal dexterity he shows while dealing with the multi-ethnic, polyglot population of far-north Kerala is impressive. In the “land of seven languages”, as the region is popularly known, he swiftly switches between Malayalam and Kannada, which are the day-to-day languages of a majority of Manjeshwaram natives. “It is after a long time that the people of Manjeshwaram have got an opportunity to vote for one of their community. Beyond all partisan political considerations, the Kannada minority of the state has been facing negligence on the part of authorities in many areas in day-to-day life,” says Ashraf, a BA degree holder in Kannada from Govinda Pai Memorial College. He rubbishes the popular perception that Kasaragod district is innately communal both politically and culturally. “Manjeshwaram has one of the most secular populations in the state unlike certain other parts of the district, perhaps because of its mixed culture. And for this reason, whenever BJP tries to field a strong candidate, the people become alert and it indirectly benefits the UDF,” he says. The Sri Udyavara Arasumanjushnath Temple at Udyavar in Manjeshwaram is a symbol of the region’s secular nature. The temple invites members of the over 1000-strong Muslim community members of the nearby Jamath mosque for its annual festival in which Rath Yatra is a highlight. Both Hindu and Muslim community members have been participating in each other’s festivals with much fanfare for years. Ashraf, who has been the Manjeshwaram block panchayat president, also takes pride in his involvement in Kabaddi and under-arm cricket, a variant that is unique to the Tulunad region, with ardent supporters not only in Kasaragod but also among the huge expatriate population. The Manjeshwaram constituency comprises eight panchayats- Manjeshwaram, Meenja, Vorkady, Paivalike, Mangalpady, Kumbala, Puthige, and Enmakaje. Both LDF and UDF have control over four each, with UDF having the reins of block and district panchayats as well. The constituency has been with the UDF since 1987, barring 2006 when LDF won the seat. In the last assembly elections in 2016, BJP candidate and party state president K Surendran lost by just 89 votes to UDF. TOI caught up with Surendran who is contesting again from the constituency at Kumbala panchayat town hall where he was holding a convention of BJP supporters. Here, we got convinced that the ability to communicate in local languages matters. Standing among die-hard party workers, we wondered if the election was to the Kerala assembly or the Karnataka assembly! It was Kannada all around and hardly anyone was speaking in Malayalam. After introductions in Kannada by local leaders, Surendran begins his speech in Kannada, and after a few words, he switches over to Malayalam with an apology. “What have the two fronts done for the state? Why is it that the benefits of the Narendra Modi-led BJP government are not reaching the people of the state? These two fronts are here only for corruption and illegal activities,” his words got lost in the thunderous applause from his audience. Surendran has been honing his skills in Kannada for the last many years, ever since he became a resident of Kasaragod from where he contested to the Lok Sabha in 2009. Soon the focus shifted from development to religion. “The government here always discriminates against religions and communities. It would not dare to touch any land or religious institution belonging to either the Muslim or Christian communities. They would run their institutions on their own, but when it comes to temples, the government dictates the terms,” he said. Coincidentally, as Surendran finishes his speech and prepares for his roadshow, the afternoon calls to prayer from the Badar Juma Masjid reverberated around. As the bright hot afternoon sun shone over the dusty Kumbala town, he left for the roadshow by foot, before heading to interior villages bordering Karnataka. Compared to UDF and BJP candidates, LDF candidate VV Ramesan looked like a total outsider. His only link with the constituency is that he had been in charge of elections held in Manjeshwaram. But he strongly refutes the notion that his nativity or language skills have anything to do with people voting for him. “Had that been the case, how did Sankar Rai lose the elections? How did Rajmohan Unnithan, an outsider to Kasaragod, win from the constituency in the last elections,” he asks. His words echo the claims of his leader and chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan that the vote would be for development. From an outsider’s perspective, the factors that would decide the fate of candidates are complex here. Over and above party lines or ideologies, beyond linguistic and religious considerations, things like the development of sports, inter-state travel issues with Karnataka, waste management, etc will play decisive roles here. And that alone would make it an interesting constituency to watch out for.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/unpredictable-poll-battle-in-states-northern-border-seat/articleshow/81749420.cms||KP Saikiran
---||Mumbai||Sachin Waze case: NIA now fishes out Aurangabad van number plate from Mithi||AURANGABAD/MUMBAI: Vehicles and number plates appear to be inextricably intertwined with the case of explosives found near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence and the subsequent murder of businessman Mansukh Hiran, report Mohammed Akhef & Mateen Hafeez. On Monday, a day after NIA recovered number plates among other electronic gadgets from Mithi river, Aurangabad resident Vijay Nade claimed that the two recovered number plates belonged to his van which was stolen from Aurangabad in November 2020. Two vehicles, a Scorpio in which explosives were placed and an Innova, which tailed it, had fake number plates. Based on information provided by Waze, NIA, with the help of divers, recovered one laptop, one printer, two hard disks, a pair of number plates, two CPUs and two DVRs from the Mithi river on Sunday. Several fake number plates were also recovered from the Scorpio, Innova and other SUVs used by Waze and his accomplices. Nade, a clerk with the social justice department in Jalna, owned a Maruti Eeco vehicle bearing registration number MH-20-DP-1539. He said that on November 16 last year, he registered a complaint of theft with the City Chowk police station of Aurangabad city. Nade, a resident of Chhatrapati Nagar, N-12, Hudco, New Aurangabad, told TOI he was stunned after his stolen vehicle’s registration number plates were found by NIA. City Chowk police inspector Sambhaji Pawar told TOI, “The case till date has remained undetected. We will communicate with the authorities there to find out if the car stolen from Aurangabad was used there, or if it was only the number plate that was used.” Nade added, “I learnt about it only after I started receiving calls from journalists asking for the whereabouts of the car registered in my name. This morning I reached out to police and demanded a probe.” The DVRs were believed to have been installed at the Mumbai police headquarters and at the Thane housing society where Waze resided, sources said. The DVR at the police headquarters contained footage of vehicle movements at the police headquarters, while the second one reportedly shows that one of the two vehicles involved in the crime was parked in Waze’s housing society. NIA officials said that the recovered articles were identified by their rightful owners/custodians, from whom the accused, Waze, had collected them illegally without proper documentation. Also, the laptop and printer recovered were used by Waze in his office. A visible effort was made by the accused to destroy the items as hammer marks are present on them, officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/waze-case-nia-now-fishes-out-abad-van-no-plate-from-mithi/articleshow/81751035.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Data till March 25 shows that in 2019-20, the state collected Rs 1.85 lakh crore as GST, which fell to Rs 1.64 lakh crore in the current year—a Rs 21,594 crore shortfall. The Goods and Services Tax is the main revenue earner for Maharashtra, whose collections are the highest in the country. It includes Central-GST, State-GST, Integrated-GST and cess. When the Maharashtra budget was tabled on March 8, the state had revised its target for SGST collections.  Although the target for 2020-21 had been set at Rs 1 lakh crore, the state had collected Rs 88,000 crore. The gap was Rs 19,146 crore. “The tax collections are not showing the expected buoyancy due to the Covid-19 pandemic and non-receipt of compensation cess from the central government,” the budget documents stated. However, the data shows that while Goods and Services Tax collections were at their lowest during the peak of the lockdown owing to the lack of economic activity, they recovered once the restrictions were eased. The main recovery came with the onset of the festive season in October 2020. In March, in fact, Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections in the state were 7% higher than they were in 2019-20. In March 2019-20, collections were Rs 14,712 crore compared to Rs 15,765 crore in March 2020-21. Data shows that SGST collections were lowest in April and May during the peak of the lockdown—81.3% lower than in 2019 during the month of April and 47.6% lower in the month of May. Collections revived with easing of the restrictions in June, but dipped once again in July and August. The receipts revived in October and by December and SGST collections were 3% higher than they were during the same month last year. A presentation by the state finance department to the Maharashtra cabinet in September 2020 had highlighted concerns about GST collections. “The contraction in GST collections reflects the weakness in Maharashtra’s economy,” it pointed out. The presentation also predicted a contraction in the state’s economic growth with the GSDP growth expected to decline by 7.4% between October-December 2020 and slide further to -16.4% between January-March 2021. The presentation also pointed out that unemployment and job losses would be major hindrances in the revival of the economy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maharashtra-gst-collections-see-11-6-dip-in-pandemic-year/articleshow/81751582.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar
---||Kochi||AK Balan’s absence an advantage for UDF in Tarur||PALAKKAD: Tarur, the birth place of late Carnatic music exponent Chembai Vaidyanatha Bhagavathar, freedom fighter and writer K P Keshava Menon and renowned birdwatcher Induchudan, is witnessing an all out fight by UDF candidate K S Sheeba to capture the LDF citadel in the absence of CPM minister A K Balan this . Since its inception, Tarur has been A K Balan’s bastion. He had won assembly elections with a huge margin in 2011 and 2016. He had won the seat twice earlier when it was known as Kuzhalmannam. However, Balan had to abdicate the seat due to the two-term sealing imposed by CPM to contest election. Meanwhile, the alleged attempts to make his wife Dr Jamila the LDF candidate had unleashed a major controversy within the party and in the political circles. LDF candidate and district president of DYFI P P Sumode said he is banking on development schemes brought by minister Balan over the past 10 years. UDF candidate K A Sheeba of Congress who unsuccessfully contested from Alathur Lok Sabha seat in 2014 said the front is hopeful that it would win the seat this time as UDF’s Ramya Haridas had won the previous Lok Sabha election with a huge margin of 24,839 votes. However, UDF had lost six out of eight grama panchayats in the recently-concluded local body election. The front also had some issues with Congress veteran and former district Congress committee president A K Gopinath, who was also Peringottukurissi grama panchayat president for 25 years, when he revolted against the party. But with the intervention of senior leaders, including Oommen Chandy, the issue has been resolved for time being. Meanwhile, NDA candidate K P Prakash, a local resident, is leaving no stone unturned to catch up with his rivals. BJP had received 15,493 votes in the 2016 assembly election in the constituency. Prakash’s campaigns are focused on development schemes of the central government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/a-k-balans-absence-an-advantage-for-udf-in-tarur/articleshow/81749447.cms||---

---||Kochi||Tricky situation in UDF stronghold||Kochi: For a constituency that had been used to triangular contests in the past, this time it is a different story. Joining the poll fray of LDF, UDF and NDA is the new comer Twenty20, the corporate-backed political party which keeps a non-aligned policy. The incumbent, V P Sajeendran of Congress, is banking on the developmental projects and welfare measures he had taken up in his constituency during his last two stints as the MLA. While talking to the voters, he highlights the Rs 100 crore spent on renovation of roads, Rs 26 crore used for building 19 drinking water projects and Rs 3.70 crore being spent on the SC/ST colonies in the area. However, he believes that perhaps his notable achievement is ensuring healthcare benefits of Rs 25 crore to the needy from the scheduled castes development department, during the last UDF government’s period. “The SC office at Vadavucode block panchayat still holds the record of Rs 15 crore disbursed through it,” he said. Sajeendran began his campaigning by meeting the workers at the gates of the refinery, to which the constituency is spread to, before venturing to house visits. By then, his campaign teams had already completed two house visits and was planning for two more. “Then, we will have roadshows, neighbourhood meetings and public functions at junctions,” he said. In fact, his opponent from Twenty20, Sujith P Surendran is literally sweating it out while doing multiple cris-crossings of the panchayat, campaigning. “Today we are covering every wards in Kizhakkambalam panchayat. Have you noticed these very smooth roads? These are not built by the PWD, but by the local panchayat,” he said. Surendran is showcasing the changes his party had made to Kizhakkambalam after Twenty20 gained power there. He said he is planning to address four issues of the people if he wins the election. “Our primary focus is improving the basic living standards of the people here. And that includes access to clean drinking water, food security, medical care, infrastructure development,” he said. Twenty20 is quite upbeat about the fact that they have won majority in four of the eight panchayats of the constituency. The LDF is precisely looking at the growing popularity of Twenty20 and thinks that it might work in their favour if there is a moderate erosion of votes from the UDF. And the LDF candidate, P V Sreenijan, is also focusing on the developmental agenda of the LDF government to woo votes. Personally he has some infrastructure projects to his credit as the president of the Ernakulam district sports council. He completed projects worth Rs 51 crore during a short span of two years. These include the indoor stadium and synthetic track at Muvattupuzha, football field and synthetic track at Chelad, Kothamangalam, multi-gym at Thripunithura and a small football field at Pallarimangalam. “As an administrator, I have proved that I can do things and that gives me confidence to contest,” Sreenijan said. BJP’s state secretary Renu Suresh is their candidate at Kunnathunad and she is hopeful of increasing the vote share in the constituency. “We have finished the third round of campaigning at the junctions and started the second round of house visits on Sunday. The roadshows are also in full swing,” she said. She is highlighting the welfare programmes funded by the central government in her speeches. “This is the right opportunity to discuss such projects,” Renu added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/tricky-situation-in-udf-stronghold/articleshow/81749440.cms||Shenoy Karun

---||Mumbai||Mumbai couple exonerated in drug case in Qatar, to return home soon||MUMBAI: City couple Oniba and Sharique Qureshi, who were sentenced to a 10-year jail term in a drug case and fined over Rs 1 crore in Qatar in 2019, were cleared of all the charges and will be returning to Mumbai soon, the Indian Embassy in Qatar informed their families. The couple was arrested at Hamad International Airport in July 2019 after Qatari authorities recovered 4.1kg hashish from their bag. Unknown to them, Sharique’s aunt, Tabassum Qureshi, had used them to transport the drugs. Oniba and Sharique, both 30 years old, were ‘forced’ to go on their second honeymoon by Tabassum who sponsored the trip. Sharique was employed with a Japanese company, while Oniba had just learnt she was pregnant. She delivered a girl, Aayat, in jail in February 2020. When the couple’s families found Sharique’s phone which had recorded several conversations where Tabassum could be heard terming a parcel as gutkha, they approached Mumbai police and she was arrested. “We are very happy and relieved. We will see our children after a long time,” said Kausar Parveen, Oniba’s mother. Shareef Qureshi, Sharique’s father, stayed in Qatar for 15 months and hired a lawyer for the couple. After the court sentenced the couple to 10-year jail term, their relatives went in appeal. The appeal court on January 27, 2020, rejected the couple’s plea and confirmed the trial court’s verdict. In January 2021, the Court of Cassation (criminal department) conducted a hearing and reviewed documents submitted by the couple’s lawyer. The next month, it accepted their appeal and withheld the sentence. Ruling that the appeal court verdict was ‘defective’, the Court of Cassation said the appellants did not have criminal intent and they were unaware the seized material was narcotics. It returned the case directing a new judgment under a different bench. “They will issue the court order copy and then the process to send the couple to India will begin,” Dheeraj Kumar, assistant section officer, labour and community welfare department, Indian Embassy in Qatar, told TOI. The families are thankful to SRH Fahimi, first secretary at the embassy, and the Narcotics Control Bureau.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-couple-exonerated-in-drug-case-in-qatar-to-return-home-soon-in-mumbai/articleshow/81750165.cms||Mateen Hafeez
---||Pune||Pune: Bullet hits mobile in shirt pocket, close shave for gang-rape survivor||PUNE: A 14-year-old gangrape survivor from Parvati had a close shave when one of the five suspects — a minor —fired at her from a pistol after committing the crime in a flat at an SRA scheme in Warje, but the bullet hit her cellphone in the chest pocket of her shirt. “The rape and the firing incident occurred a fortnight ago, but the girl was too frightened to disclose it to anyone,” Pune crime branch inspector Mahendra Jagtap said. The matter came to light when Jagtap and his team arrested Warje resident Shrikant Rajendra Kale (23) from Dhankawdi on March 26 and recovered a pistol and three bullets from him. A separate case under the Arms Act was registered for this offence with the Sahakarnagar police. Jagtap said, “An inspection of the seized firearm revealed that it was used recently. We subjected Kale to some intense grilling, during which he told us that it was used by his friend, a minor, at his flat in Warje to terrorise a girl about a fortnight ago. He also told us that the bullet hit the girl, but she survived as the impact of the bullet was taken by her key-pad phone.” Jagtap, along with assistant inspector Vaishali Bhosale and sub-inspector Anandrao Pingle, then traced the girl to her residence in the Parvati area and counselled her to lodge an FIR. She lodged the complaint with the Dattawadi police on Sunday as she was picked up by the suspects from a place in Parvati. “The girl was familiar with all the five suspects, who took her to the Warje flat on the pretext of celebrating birthday of one of them,” the officer said. “The Dattawadi police on Sunday arrested Krushna alias Rohan Ashok Ovhal (24) of Hadapsar and Niranjan alias Nilesh Shinde (20) of Warje, besides, detaining the two minor boys. One of the minor boys tested positive for Covid-19. Kale is still in the custody of the crime branch,” Jagtap said. A case of kidnapping, gangrape, attempt to murder, criminal intimidation and under various sections of the POCSO Act has been registered by the Dattawadi police. “The flat where the gangrape and the firing incident occurred is owned by Kale’s father,” he said. The police said the girl’s parents had separated and she lived with her grandmother. The girl stated in her FIR that the five suspects had invited her to the birthday celebration of one of the two detained minor boys a fortnight ago.  She and her female friend went to the flat for the birthday celebrations after one of the suspects picked them up from a spot in Parvati. “Three of the suspects raped her in the flat and later threatened her with consequences. When the girl wanted to leave after a while, one of the minor boys restrained her from going out. When the girl insisted on leaving, the minor boy pulled out the pistol and fired at her,” Jagtap said. He said, “The three arrested men and the two minor boys are school dropouts and are into small scrap business. Owing to their business activities, they know each other. Kale, earlier arrested in an attempt to murder case, told the police that he bought the pistol from Mathura in Uttar Pradesh for self-defence thinking that his rivals might attack him.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/bullet-hits-mobile-in-shirt-pocket-close-shave-for-gang-rape-survivor/articleshow/81749459.cms||---

---||Pune||Pune sizzles at 40.1°C first time this summer||PUNE: The maximum temperature touched 40 degrees celsius for the first time this summer in the city after hot winds from north India sent the mercury up in the rest of the state too. Shivajinagar recorded 39.3 degrees celsius as the day temperature on Monday while Lohegaon was a sizzling 40.1 degrees celsius. Both were two to three degrees above the normal. North India has been heating up significantly and those hot winds have swept over parts of central India and Maharashtra, Skymet Weather Services president G P Sharma told TOI on Monday. “Delhi recorded a high day temperature of 40.1 degrees C on Monday, its highest March day temperature since 2005. Winds from the north tend to flow into central India and parts of Maharashtra, increasing temperatures. Gujarat is also recording near heat-wave conditions. Thus, the impact of a hot northwest India can also spill over to Maharashtra. Temperatures are on the higher side in several parts of the country since the last three days. Heat conditions are above normal this time during March in many parts of the country in comparison to the last few years,” he added. However, temperatures may come down slightly after the next couple of days, but a rise in the mercury across several parts of India is likely to recur soon. “Changes in the wind pattern, influenced by western disturbances up north will cause the mercury to fluctuate every few days,” Sharma said. All locations in Maharashtra are currently recording high day temperatures, significantly above the normal in some parts. In fact, the maximum temperatures are 3-5 degrees celsius above the normal in Vidarbha which is on a heat-wave alert. IMD on Monday had forecast heat-wave conditions in some pockets with severe heat-wave conditions in isolated pockets over West Rajasthan and heat-wave conditions in isolated pockets over Himachal Pradesh on Monday, East Rajasthan, Saurashtra, Kutch and Madhya Pradesh on Monday and Tuesday and Vidarbha on Tuesday. An IMD official told TOI, “Parts of Rajasthan are recording positive day temperature departures in the range of 6-7 degrees celsius, with a similar trend in Delhi on Monday where the maximum temperature was above the normal by 8 degrees. Winds from north India to Maharashtra have been heating up the state. However, we have not reported a heat-wave condition in parts of the state, though Vidarbha is on alert.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/city-sizzles-at-40-1c-first-time-this-summer/articleshow/81749466.cms||Neha Madaan

---||Thiruvananthapuram||AICC alleges Modi-Adani-Pinarayi nexus||Thiruvananthapuram: AICC general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala said there is a secret nexus between Pinarayi Vijayan, Adani Group and Narendra Modi government. He asked whether LDF had decided to purchase 300MW long-term wind power for 25 years from Adani Group at an approximate estimated cost of Rs 8,785 crore. “If yes, was the transfer of Thiruvananthapuram airport by the Centre to the Adani Group and its paper opposition by Pinarayi Vijayan was a mere farce and facade to hoodwink the people about the larger understanding between LDF and BJP?” he asked. Time has come to ask questions and demand answers from Vijayan by looking at the fact of the wind power purchase by the LDF government as the timing of the gold smuggling case and its aftermath is uniquely similar to the power purchase, he added. The AICC leader said the Vijayan government and Modi government together reduced Kerala’s quota for solar energy from 2.75% to a mere 0.25%. This change led to the need for purchase of wind power by the Vijayan government from Adani Group. As per the Union ministry’s data, the wind power production capacity of Kerala is 1,699MW, but it has an installed capacity of a mere 62.5MW. “Why is the Pinarayi government then not committing to a local wind power production and promoting wind power producers from Kerala as against the Adani Group?” Surjewala asked. He urged the chief minister to disclose the reason for purchase of wind power from other states and consequently, even suffer certain amount of transmission losses, which could have been completely avoided by producing it in Kerala, thus resulting in investments and creation of jobs in the state itself.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/aicc-alleges-modi-adani-pinarayi-nexus/articleshow/81749472.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray seeks roadmap for second lockdown, NCP & BJP oppose||MUMBAI: CM Uddhav Thackeray has directed the administration to draw up a roadmap for a second lockdown, a move that drew opposition from his own alliance partner, NCP, not to mention angry voices in BJP who warned of public protests. A decision may be likely on April 2 after a review. The instructions coincided with the state reporting an all-time high of over 40,000 cases. A day later on Monday, the tally tapered to 31,643. In Mumbai, cases added up to over 12,000 in the last 48 hours. The ‘lockdown’ plan does not have enough takers among politicians, who worry about a public backlash. Experts tracking the pandemic’s progress though are in favour of rolling back relaxationsin movement as well as trade and commerce. “Most cabinet members are against a lockdown. In the first lockdown people suffered, a large number lost their jobs and the economy collapsed,'' said NCP spokesperson and state minister Nawab Malik. Within Shiv Sena there is no consensus on the issue, but NCP has been vocal in its opposition. In a meeting of public health officials and the state’s Covid-19 taskforce with Thackeray over the weekend, the CM said a Standard Operating Procedure must be kept ready to guide the state in the event another lockdown became necessary. He said restrictions and rules issued are not being followed by the public, adding health facilities added may not suffice in the event of a sharp surge. Thackeray said a SoP should be put in place to ensure essential services, including supply of foodgrains, medicines, and medical services, are not hamstrung if a lockdown is imposed. Senior officials said a review of the situation is likely on April 2 and a decision could be taken then. Cases in Maharashtra have risen exponentially in the last fortnight, with 3.9 lakh people testing positive. Between March 1 and March 28, over 5.4 lakh cases were detected, almost as much as in September 2020, the worst month in terms of Covid19 tallies. At present, the weekly positivity rate in Maharashtra is the highest in the country at 22.78%; the state conducts 1.5 lakh tests daily. Explaining the current Covid-19 situation and facilities available to tackle it, Pradeep Vyas, principal secretary, public health, said infections are shooting up, coursing rapidly through the population. Key facilities, especially beds, ventilators and oxygen supply, would soon turn scarce. Members of the taskforce pointed out that if cases continue to spread, the death toll could also increase and this could be due to delay in hospitalization and testing as well as non-compliance with rules while in home isolation. “Lockdown is the last resort, but we have to consider it because the healthcare infrastructure is crumbling. There are no beds available in the private sector and public-sector beds too are getting filled fast,” said task force member Dr Shashank Joshi who was part of Sunday’s meeting. However, Sena MP and party leader Sanjay Raut said he had spoken to Thackeray and suggested that rather than a lockdown which will be very damaging to the economy, more curbs could be imposed. “I am not in favour of a complete lockdown. The working class, businesses and the economic cycle will be affected. I spoke to the CM and he too is of the same view," said Raut. Malik of the NCP said instead of a second lockdown, all out efforts should be made to strengthen health infrastructure, boost vaccinations and enforce Covid-appropriate behaviour. “Vigilance is very poor. As a result, people are roaming on roads without masks. Responsibility must be fixed on ward officers,'' he said. The opposition warned of protests if a lockdown is imposed. “It will hit the poor hard,” said BJP state president Chandrakant Patil. He demanded that the government declare a package of Rs 5,000 for daily wagers who will be impacted by the lockdown. Chief Secretary Sitaram Kunte said the pace of vaccination was satisfactory though the Centre has suggested speeding it up in areas where incidence of infection was high. Efforts are being made for it, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/cm-seeks-roadmap-for-second-lockdown-ncp-bjp-oppose/articleshow/81751043.cms||---

The court directed the undertaking to hand over the amounts ranging from Rs 30 lakh to 10 lakh. In separate orders, the court said that an employee expects and deserves as a matter of right, some reward after a long meritorious service. The gratuity will have to be paid with 10% interest. Among the applicants, Mohammad Ansari, who worked with the undertaking from 1984 to 2019, told the court that he submitted an application under the Payment of Gratuity Act for around Rs 30 lakh, but got no response. His plea said that till October 2016 as per the provisions under the Act, the BEST used to pay the gratuity amount to the retiring employees within one month from the date of the superannuation from service. The undertaking, however, submitted that, it was facing a severe financial crisis due to revenue losses, and this had resulted in the increase of deficit. It also said that there was a mismatch in its income and expenditure. —Rebecca Samervel||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/cant-cite-cash-crunch-to-not-pay-gratuity-court-to-best-in-mumbai/articleshow/81750191.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Delhi||Rai: E corpn’s negligence led to fire at landfill||New Delhi: Environment minister Gopal Rai on Tuesday said that due to negligence of the BJP-led east corporation, a fire broke out at the Ghazipur landfill site on Sunday and it led to rise in pollution levels. Rai said, “An inquiry team of Delhi Pollution Control Committee has revealed that the fire was due to the corporation’s carelessness. No such system which can help in curbing or dousing fire has been installed. Due to the advent of summers, such landfills are prone to fires and a monitoring system should be set up to analyse them. We will file a strong complaint against the corporation.” The minister said that “the Kejriwal-led government’s measures in curbing pollution have been successful as Delhi’s rank has dropped down to 10th spot in the IQAir report while seven of UP’s cities, including Lucknow, are among the most polluted in top 10 cities.” Citing a CSE report, Rai said that Delhi’s PM 2.5 had decreased at the rate of 25% between 2018 and 2020. The report also disclosed that Delhi is the first state in India to have shut down those power plants that emit harmful gases, and the first state to have 39 Air Quality Monitoring Systems. “Neighbouring states play a major role in curtailing pollution in Delhi. If Ghaziabad has a high pollution rate, Delhi will inevitably suffer. Furthermore, Noida, Greater Noida or Gurgaon are severely polluted, it will have an impact on Delhi’s air pollution. Hence, I request the central government to analyse these two reports and make efforts like shutting down dangerous power plants or putting an end to diesel-oriented generators by providing 24x7 electricity and they should create the right action plan,” Rai said. He claimed that “the central government is sleeping on these efforts.” The minister further said, as Delhi was providing 24-hour power supply, the dependence of industries on diesel generator sets during power cuts had been stopped. “Delhi is the first state to have set up war rooms to control pollution. Green Delhi App helped us in analysing efforts to manage the AQI round-the-clock. The war room received as many as 20,000 complaints, of which 93% have been resolved,” Rai said. Delhi is also the first state to launch tree transplantation policy, he added. There was no response available from the corporation on this matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rai-e-corpns-negligence-led-to-fire-at-landfill/articleshow/81768342.cms||---
---||Pune||New concepts introduced in Std V, IX baffle most pupils||Pune: Statistics from the State Council of Education Research and Training (SCERT) report show that performance of students in science and maths dipped after standard IV and VIII. The report indicated that new concepts of higher difficulty introduced after standards IV and VIII and no activity-based learning have affected the performance. Educators said not many teachers can convey the concepts and the activity-based learning in an interactive manner. Several teachers and board of studies members added that the moment a student fails to understand a concept, his or her interest starts dwindling, and rote-learning to score marks sets in. Textbooks and examination methods also need revision, followed by intensive teacher-training, they added. Shamshuddin Attar, an innovative mathematics teacher from the Konkan region, said when a student fails to understand a concept in standard V, he or she will stop understanding the advanced calculations in standard VI and it will continue in the next class. “Even bright students lose interest in the subject. Activity-based learning in the actual class is very different. Only six of the 40 marks have activity-based questions which means if a student learns by rote, he or she can get good marks,”Attar added. Ashok Rupner of Indrani Balan Science Activity Centre at IISER, Pune and his team have been uploading science-maths activity videos online as a part of a project in association with the state education department. He said it is a multi-pronged problem. “We need to break out of the rigid structures of school education where the syllabus needs to be completed in a particular period and examinations held in a particular way. After the 43-hour videos that we have uploaded, we have got about 6,000 letters from teachers who said they never knew a particular topic could be taught in such a way,” Rupner added. Sulbha Vidhate has been a member of the board of studies for science and is currently the principal of Rani Laxmibai Girls’ Military School. She said there should be more training and teachers themselves should be motivated to start learning based on experiments, especially in science. “We need to bring in day-to-day examples in science into the classrooms so that students understand how it works in the real world. We have 40% teachers who try, but we need the remaining 60% to adopt this model. Examinations must reflect it. Currently, only about 6 to 8 marks in the board examinations are allotted to thinking-based questions while the remaining are memory-based. This pattern must change so that teachers can adapt,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/new-concepts-introduced-in-std-v-ix-baffle-most-pupils/articleshow/81749477.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Pune||Gender lessons on radio for 3k kids to check crime||Pune: Bhannat Shala, a weekly free-of-cost web radio programme, started by two former Pune-based Balchitravani officials is trying to reach young minds in the state, especially in the rural or low-income groups to spread gender awareness, sensitivity, equality in a fun way, so as to curb violence and crime in adolescents. It was started in December 2019 by Bipinchandra Chaugule and Vedavati Jogi with funding from industrialist Cyrus Poonawalla and cooperation from the Women and Child Development Commissionerate.Bhannat Shala initially addressed a target audience of some 2,000 to 3,000 children in conflict with law, from 53 government children’s homes in Maharashtra.From January 1, 2021, the web radio series expanded to children between the 12 to 19 age group through 20 community radio stations and some educational web radios like Nashik’s Radio Espalier. The design and scripting of these audio programmes was derived from a research project carried out by Vedavati Jogi between 2011-13, under a central senior research fellowship. Bhannat Shala followed a path through a weekly web radio episode partly with scripted and pre-recorded content and largely with the audience participation recorded in the homes in December 2019.“We would tell the centre heads in these homes to record what the students wanted to perform and send it to us on WhatsApp. We would go to these homes and interact with the children and record them. Initially, it was tricky making them open up but once they listened to their own voice on the radio programme, they were enthused. Their stories were tragic and often a result of what they had seen in their own homes and neighbourhood,” Jogi said.In many cases, there was a lack of gender awareness, someone to talk, violence at home which were triggers to commit crime. “Hence, we needed to generate debates on gender topics, relationships, metal-physical health, education, repercussions of committing a crime,” Jogi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/gender-lessons-on-radio-for-3k-kids-to-check-crime/articleshow/81749481.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Kozhikode||Surendran asks CM to clarify stand on love jihad||Kozhikode: BJP state president K Surendran asked chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan to clarify his stand on the remarks made by KC(M) chairman Jose K Mani on the love jihad issue. Addressing the media at Kasaragod Press Club on Monday, Surendran said it was for the first time a constituent in the LDF has confirmed the stand taken by BJP on the issue. “CPM will not be able to continue its elusive stand. Though it was the stand taken by Christian community which made Jose K Mani come out with the statement, the fact remains a fact,” he said. Surendran added that when BJP had raised the issue, CPM had taken a stand in favour of extremists. “People of the state would like to know the stand of the chief minister and CPM regarding love jihad,” he said. When asked to comment on Jose’s statement, Vijayan evaded the question by saying that he had not come across the statement. He told reporters in Kannur that the question should be posed to Jose himself. Surendran said that LDF government was taking a provocative stand on Sabarimala issue and the statements by its top leaders’ show that it is continuing its earlier stand. “Sabarimala will not remain safe as long as this government remains in power. Though some ministers had backtracked from their earlier stand following protests by believers, CPM central leadership and the CM has taken a public stand against them. It shows that LDF government is not going to change its stand and will set the stage for the entry of young women at the temple,” he said. Surendran alleged that huge malpractices were being carried out in postal voting, violating EC guidelines. “There is concern whether the moves by CPM to conduct electoral fraud with the help of a section of election officials will lead to conflict. There are over 3,000 bogus votes in Kasaragod and Manjeswaram and EC has not taken steps to remove them from electoral rolls,” he added. Surendran alleged that there is a deal between CPM and IUML in Manjeswaram and Uduma. Meanwhile, Union minister of state V Muraleedharan said Jose K Mani had shared the apprehensions and concerns of the church.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/surendran-asks-cm-to-clarify-stand-on-love-jihad/articleshow/81749482.cms||---

NCP, as expected, has announced the candidature of Bhagirath, the son of late MLA Bharat Bhelke. Autade will file his nomination papers on Tuesday in the presence of senior party functionaries including Devendra Fadnavis. Bhelke will also file his papers on Tuesday, in the presence of deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar. Autade’s name was announced after long deliberations with MLC Prashant Paricharak who also has strong political clout in the constituency. Paricharak has promised all cooperation to Autade in the election. Autade has been in the BJP functionaries’ good books for a long time now. He has sought a BJP ticket in 2019, but the party had opted for Sudhakar Paricharak. Autade who had competed as an independent, however, lost the election but had garnered an impressive number of votes. Sources in the BJP said that Autade was chosen as a combination of Autade-Paricharak could ensure the party’s victory. In 2019, Autade had got 54,000 votes even though he contested as independent. Paricharak, the official BJP candidate then, lost the election with 13,000 votes. BJP veterans said the sympathy factor for Bharat Bhelke’s son may not be of significance as the voters had equal sympathy for the Paricharak family since Sudhakar Paricharak died a few months ago. NCP’s Maharashtra president Jayant Patil announced Bhagirath Bhelke’s name on Monday evening. Bhagirath Bhelke was a strong aspirant even though his name was opposed by a section of NCP workers. Bhagirath Bhelke, however, will face a tough challenge in pacifying the constituents of the Maha Vikas Aaghadi. Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana (SSS) functionary Sachin Patil and Shiv Sena’s Shaila Godse have already filed their nomination papers. Both had announced that they will contest the bypoll even if their respective parties took some other decisions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/pandharpur-bypoll-to-see-bhelke-vs-autade-contest/articleshow/81749479.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kerala CM ‘lying’: Piyush Goyal on ‘attack’ on nuns||KOCHI: Union minister for railways and commerce and industries, Piyush Goyal, said reports that two nuns and two postulants, belonging to Sacred Heart Congregation in Delhi province, were attacked by alleged ABVP workers at Jhansi railway station in Uttar Pradesh while they were traveling in train to Odisha on March 19 were baseless. Goyal, while addressing the press in Kochi, said chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan has spread lies that nuns were attacked to appease the minority in Kerala and create vote banks. Incidentally, the state leadership of BJP in Kerala had earlier approached the UP government seeking an inquiry into the incident. Goyal said the local police in Jhansi had responded to a complaint received from some of the passengers about the nuns after seeing them with two young girls. He said it was the responsibility of the police to investigate the complaint received. “There was no attack on anyone and such allegations are completely baseless. The chief minister of Kerala lied to people and gave false statements. Police had to investigate the issue when certain allegations were raised against the nuns... If police had not investigated and something unfortunate had happened to the young girls, wouldn’t it have been terrible and shameful,” asked Goyal. He said the simple inquiry procedure to check the genuineness of passengers was wrongly portrayed as attack on nuns. “The allegations against the nun were completely wrong. But CM’s spreading lies about the incident is a clear example of minority appeasement politics to ensure vote bank,” he said, adding that UDF and LDF were dividing the society to create vote banks. KCBC demands fair probe The Kerala Catholic Bishop Council (KCBC) reacted sharply to the words of the Union minister and demanded a fair probe into the incident. “Officials should know that if monks and saints can wear ‘kashaya’ dress and if following ‘digambara’ tradition is allowed in the country, then nuns can wear their religious habit. People have the right to follow any religious beliefs and wear any dress. Here, the mob harassed the nuns and the two girls and the railway police failed to provide security to them. It was a serious situation as women were questioned by the mob for wearing a Christian religious habit,” KCBC official spokesperson Fr Jacob Palakkappilly said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cm-lying-goyal-on-attack-on-nuns/articleshow/81749486.cms||---
---||Delhi||Early rise in temperature triggering mosquito spike?||NEW DELHI: The early spike in temperature has caused an increase in mosquito breeding. A report from the vector-borne diseases headquarters says domestic checkers detected 1,023 cases of mosquito breeding between January 1 and March 27 against 389 cases in the same period last year. South Delhi Municipal Corporation found 588 positive breeding cases at residential and other complexes, followed by 250 by EDMC and 185 by the north corporation. Despite the rise in mosquito numbers, the cases of mosquito-borne diseases are as yet low, with three malaria, six dengue and one chikungunya incidents. The day temperature climbed to 40.1 degrees Celsius on Holi, the highest maximum in March since 1945, when the day’s highest was 40.5 degrees Celsius. This is 8 degrees above normal for this time of the season. “Mosquitoes prefer warmer environments above 30 degrees. Below 20 degrees, they become less active, becoming nonfunctional below 10 degrees,” a public health official explained. Anopheles mosquitoes, which are primarily responsible for malaria, breed in muddy water outdoor, while dengue-causing Aedes prefer clear water and indoor environments. The civic bodies claim that domestic breeding checkers (DBC) have so far made 27.9 lakh visits, though, as a corporation official said, the pandemic makes it more difficult to carry out vector-borne disease control. “People are reluctant to let DBC enter their houses due to fear of Covid,” said an official. “Making the work more difficult, many corporation employees have been diverted to anti-Covid work, and duties related to Delhi Master Plan and Swachhta Survekshan.” Many vacancies for the posts of malaria inspectors, assistant malaria inspectors and senior field worker are vacant hobbling the anti-mosquito exercises. Moreover, the fogging drives have been restricted under order of Delhi Disaster Management Authority because petrol-generated smoke during fogging causes irritation in the respiratory system, thus aggravating the risks about Covid, a public health official added. The five-year data on detection of mosquito breeding shows that the weekly count peaks between the 32nd and 38th week of the year, with September seeing the highest incidence. An SDMC public health department analysis shows that peri-domestic containers such as money plant pots, vases, flower pots, home fountains, etc, constitute the largest chunk of breeding sites (38%). The report says that domestic water storage containers employed in water-stressed regions account for the second highest (33%) of the cases. Desert coolers and overhead tanks are third- and fourth-biggest culprits. Meanwhile, AAP blamed BJP-led municipal corporation for mismanagement and corruption behind the failure to control the mosquito menace. Narendra Chawla, leader of the House in SDMC, retorted to the accusation by saying the increase in mosquitoes was due to the inaction of Delhi government’s flood & irrigation department and PWD in cleaning the drains in their jurisdiction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/early-rise-in-temperature-triggering-mosquito-spike/articleshow/81768399.cms||Paras Singh

He first ransacked a cellphone shop, damaged the glass counter with a brick, beat the owner and robbed Rs3,740 from the cash counter,” senior inspector Deepak Lagad said on Monday. “The youth then ransacked a neighbouring utensils shop and robbed Rs2,150 from its cash counter after threatening the owner. He also vandalised two motorcycles parked outside the shops and fled,” Lagad said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/youth-booked-on-charge-of-robbery/articleshow/81749483.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Despite temp drop of 6°C, humidity makes Mumbai sweat||MUMBAI: After soaring past 40 degree Celsius over the weekend, maximum temperatures in the city dropped by nearly six degrees in a day. Despite this, on Monday, Mumbaikars continued to experience discomfort as humidity levels shot up. The air quality, though, improved to moderate from poor. The India Meteorological Department (IMD)’s Santacruz observatory recorded a maximum temperature of 34.6 degrees.  The relative humidity recorded by IMD’s Colaba and Santacruz observatories on Monday was 77% and 52%, respectively—a steep rise from 30% and 58% on Saturday when maximum temperatures had touched 40.9 degrees in the city. On Monday, the maximum temperature recorded by IMD’s Colaba observatory was 33.3 degrees—1.3 above normal. In case of IMD’s Santacruz observatory, the maximum temperature at 34.6 degrees was 1.4 degrees above normal. Dr Jayanta Sarkar, scientist and head, IMD Mumbai, said while high humidity levels had put a cap on the temperature, the discomfort level continued to be high for the same reason. The IMD has forecast maximum temperatures are expected to continue to stay around 34-35 degrees for the next 24-48 hours with mainly clear skies. The rise in temperatures was due to north-easterly winds from a hot and dry Rajasthan. Meanwhile, the drop in temperatures improved the city’s air quality index (AQI) to the moderate category from poor over the weekend. According to the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), Mumbai’s overall AQI for PM 2.5 on Monday was 139—much improved from 276 on Saturday. While an AQI of between 100 and 200 is acceptable for the general public, there is a moderate health concern with breathing discomfort for those with lung and heart disease, and children and older adults.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/despite-temp-drop-of-6-c-humidity-makes-city-sweat-in-mumbai/articleshow/81748225.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Mumbai||Licence to party: Now, guests being asked to send in Covid-ve report in Mumbai||Mumbai: Headed to a birthday bash or an engagement ceremony? Make sure you have proof you’re Covid-negative before you land up. Not only are hosts insisting on RT-PCR tests for attendees, some are even particular about the labs for getting the test done, while others reconfirm results with the lab to ensure there has been no tampering. As Covid cases dropped, people assumed the pandemic was tapering off and went back to planning their grand shindig, only to find they had acted too soon. “For my daughter’s roka, we asked everyone who was attending to get tested two days before the event and send us the certificates,” said Liku Colombowala, an entrepreneur from Powai. The venue did not demand a copy of the RT-PCR certificate, though. “We did it for everyone’s safety since people of different age groups were attending. Everyone co-operated.” Like the Colombowalas who planned the engagement when cases had dropped and did not see the surge coming, the Patils of Wadala too were in a quandary as they had a double celebration lined up— their father’s 75th birthday and the daughter-in-law’s 50th birthday bash. “Both share their birthday on March 3, and they were milestone events. We booked the venue in the last week of January when all newspapers had flashed news of India recording less than 10,000 new cases, and the lowest daily tally as compared to the past eight months,” said Vaibhav Patil, an HR executive. Little did they know about the case spike ahead. “We were not sure about going ahead with the celebration, but then decided to follow our cousin’s advice who had requested his wedding guests to get an RT-PCR test done. We requested outstation relatives to join us virtually. Those residing in the city were asked to undergo fresh RT-PCR tests as many guests were senior citizen friends of my father,” he added. While pathology laboratories do not seek the reason for a test, Dr Nilesh Shah, president of a chain of labs, said, “Avoidable gatherings like birthday parties should be deferred or made virtual. Getting the RT-PCR tests done for guests has several drawbacks. It overloads the system that leads to inconvenience for genuinely ill patients. Moreover, it inconveniences people. For gatherings that are must, one can use a combination of a few guests coming physically and the rest can join virtually.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/licence-to-party-now-guests-being-asked-to-send-in-covid-ve-report-in-mumbai/articleshow/81750203.cms||---

Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh and senior authorities from the Pune Cantonment Board (PCB) and the Pune police accompanied the deputy chief minister, also Pune’s guardian minister.

---||Pune||Hawkers push to reopen Fashion Street at same site||Pune: The MG Road Hawkers’ Association has demanded that the Fashion Street market — gutted in a major fire on Friday night — be restarted at its existing location with the 448 originally licensed vendors. The body further demanded that 121 vendors operating at the market, who were issued temporary licences in 2008, be shifted to an alternative location. Akolkar said Pune Cantonment Board’s decision to allow these vendors to conduct their business unchecked, despite the expiry of the 11-month licence, was partially to be blamed for Friday’s fire, which gutted more than 600 stalls and destroyed property worth Rs90 lakh. “This will ensure apt decongestion of the market premises and better management from a safety standpoint,” M V Akolkar, president of association, said. The market’s present location has been the subject of a debate for quite some time over safety concerns surrounding heavy congestion, illegal vendors, and a flagrant absence of any fire safety norms. Following a damning fire safety audit in 2018, the Pune Cantonment Board moved the district court, seeking to annul a 1997 “compromise agreement” allowing 448 vendors to operate in 20sqft spaces in a strip of land wedged between East Street and MG Road in Camp. The case is sub judice. “We will soon discuss this issue in detail at our next general body. We will consider the views of all the stakeholders,” PCB chief executive Amit Kumar told TOI on Monday. Kumar said the safety and security of people at the market and residents of the surrounding area was of paramount importance and would be a key factor in any decision. “We will seek the views of the Army authorities, district administration, police and check the legal aspects,” he said. A PCB official said the board was contemplating a fresh court plea seeking directions that the market cannot be started at the same site in view of the prevailing safety concerns. A few shopkeepers have sought government compensation. “All my fresh stock, furniture and other items were destroyed,” Salim Sayyed, who ran a garments stall, said. “We have sought an appointment to table our issues before the district collector. The market should open at the earliest, thousands of people’s livelihood depends on it,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/hawkers-push-to-reopen-fashion-street-at-same-site/articleshow/81749485.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Delhi||Why no fogging yet? AAP attacks BJP||New Delhi: AAP functionary Durgesh Pathak on Tuesday said that BJP has transformed Delhi into the “mosquito capital” and claimed due to the failure of the BJP-governed municipal corporations, Delhiites are suffering from the mosquito menace. At a presser, Pathak said the entire city was under the siege by mosquitoes. “The corporations do not clear the drains nor is the garbage collected, which is the primary reason for the mosquito menace. They have not started fogging, which is done this time of the year,” he added. “It takes approximately Rs 100 crore to fog the entire city. BJP is aware that Delhiites will vote them out in the upcoming 2022 municipal elections, so they intend to misappropriate these funds and not spend them where they are meant to be used,” the AAP functionary said, questioning Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta as to why fogging was not taking place in the city. On the other hand, Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said “since AAP is steeped into corruption, its leaders claim there is corruption in the corporations too.” “It seems that the AAP has intentionally ignored that due to the Covid pandemic, there was a DDMA guideline that fogging should not be done as it could cause breathing problem for the people,” Kapoor said. Before the pandemic, the civic bodies had carried out regular fogging in all wards round the year, he added. “The AAP functionary has tried to say that by not carrying out fogging in Delhi, the corporations have pilfered Rs 100 crore. The fact, however, remains that the annual budget for fogging in all the three corporations put together is not even Rs 50 crore. I warn Mr Pathak to stop making misleading statements or be prepared to face legal consequences,” Kapoor added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-no-fogging-yet-aap-attacks-bjp/articleshow/81768449.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Last week, his widow, Nina Kar (82), bequeathed her property, a flat in Powai, to the institute. This is the first-of-its kind donation received by the institute. “He served IIT for so long that he always wanted to give back to the institute. When he suffered his first attack in the 1990s, he made his will bequeathing everything he belonged to the institute after my lifetime. I fully supported his decision,” Nina Kar told TOI. Kar was a well-known researcher in fluid mechanics who was instrumental in setting up the biomedical engineering programme at IIT-B. The institute will set up a chair in his name in the mechanical engineering department. Kar joined the institute in 1962 after completing his Ph D from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said Nina Kar. They got married in 1963 and for three decades since then, the couple called the campus their home. They do not have children. Professor Kar retired from the institute in 1992, soon after he was awarded the professor emeritus title for exceptional contribution to the institute. The culture of bequeathing through one’s will is quite common in the western countries, but it is rare in India, said IIT-B director Subhasis Chaudhuri. “What they have done for the institute is sort of pathbreaking...For our institute, it is the first, and we hope many others will follow suit to help us achieve excellence,” he added. At a time when the institute is facing serious challenges to fund the expansion, such a support from a former family member of IIT-B is encouraging, said Chaudhuri. “Professor Kar had this vision over 25 years ago when no one knew that this kind of donation could be a possibility. In the US, one who inherits the property, must give a huge chunk of the money to the government as inheritance tax. So many prefer to bequeath their property for charity, which is not the case in India. Here it is a case of philanthropy alone.” he said. When asked about the valuation of the property, he said that it is invaluable, and they are truly honored to be able to set up a chair. Professor Amit Agrawal, who is working extensively in the area of human-to-human Covid transmission, will occupy the Subir Kar Chair.

The pact allowing foreign trawlers for deep-sea fishing, special fee imposed on fishermen in ports, etc., are causing a great deal of difficulty for them. He added that when Narendra Modi is ruling the country, the fishermen community need not harbour any kind of concerns. He said church leaders and community members have already shared their concerns regarding the state government’s policies. The Centre will not give permission for any policy that would adversely affect the community. Instead, the Centre has launched special projects for rearing and increasing the fish wealth closer to the shore. Project has also been launched to convert more than 200 coastal villages as ‘smart’ villages. Citing that the Centre has spent Rs.9,600 crore in the fisheries sector since 2014, he said 75% of funds for the construction of four harbours out of the eight constructed in the state was funded by the Centre. However, he said the state government has not done anything, including constructing sea walls. State fisheries minister J Mercykutty Amma has not even met him till now, the minister added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/centre-wont-allow-policies-that-affect-fishing-community-giriraj-singh/articleshow/81749503.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||How ‘Op Twins’ unveiled bogus votes||Thiruvananthapuram: The Congress team entrusted with unearthing irregularities in the voters’ list draws an analogy to their method. A tiny, precious jewel dropped on a sandy beach can be retrieved soon enough when you know where to look for it, and this is easy for the person who actually saw the jewel being dropped. Localized surveillance coupled with a combination of strategy and analysis enabled the team to come up with scandalous revelations which have shaken up the election commission and dragged the authority to court. The mission was termed ‘Operation Twins’ and unlike the past, the team dug deep to come up with solid material to substantiate the claims. Poring over a list of over 2.5 crore voters wasn’t enough to complete the process of identifying multiple votes. It involved a task of information gathering, data processing and cross-checking which engaged a network of booth-level workers, strategists and analysts who worked with the approval of topmost UDF leaders in Kerala. The process ranged from simple leg work, house visits to multi-layered analysis using digital tools. They started with the integrated draft list in November 2020 and by March they had spent days and nights, sending voters’ lists with suspicious entries to local-level booth workers and then subjecting it to cross verification. The actual process began in 2011 when Congress rued over narrow losses in some of the constituencies. It hurt more in 2016 and local body elections. There were isolated speculations about bogus votes, but often the intent was missing to establish the truth. Getting to the heart of the matter meant getting to the roots. “There was no one better informed than a local-level booth worker. This time, the booth workers were handpicked and given separate tasks. We purchased voters’ lists with photos from taluk offices and circulated it and the workers were asked to look for specific voters. They didn’t know each other and were only doing part of a larger task,” said one of the team members. Bogus votes were traditionally associated with ASD — absentee, shifted and the dead. The team broadened the search for more possibilities. Close scrutiny revealed that same-face voters emerged in multiple booths under same constituency. It began at Kozhikode and the team subjected every single list to close analysis to come up with more sets of irregularities. The name, photo and address of an actual voter was found to be duplicated in multiple booths. “In more than 60% of these cases, the actual voter may not have any clue about her/his card being duplicated. The pertinent point is that who has got all these duplicate cards and if there is no deletion or freeze, how is the commission going to prevent these cards being misused,” one of the members said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/how-op-twins-unveiled-bogus-votes/articleshow/81749507.cms||Aswin J Kumar

The worksheets were prepared and the analysis was done by the Maharashtra State Council of Education Research and Training (SCERT). Students from standard I to X from all the 36 districts participated in the exercise aimed at checking the understanding level of students in Marathi, Urdu, mathematics and science. The classwise performance of students showed that the average till standard IV is around 70% but starts falling thereafter. Of the 20 questions given to standard X students to solve every week per subject in Marathi, Urdu, mathematics and science, the average performance which is the percentage of correct answers given by students to a total number of questions, was 53.26%, 62.35%, 45.47% and 48.52%, respectively. These students will appear for their board examinations in April. Ramakant Kathmore, an SCERT official on the project, said they would send the worksheets on Saturday via WhatsApp to all the district education officers and the other departments who would then forward it to the cellphones of the parents. “Students were given time till the next Friday to solve them. They are multiple-choice questions and once the last question is answered, the students immediately get the results showing the wrong answer, the correct one and the score,” he added. The SCERT’s dashboard allowed teachers and others to see which topics were tough for the students and which ones were solved by most of them. “There cannot be a blanket solution to education. What may be good for students in Pune may not be true for Jalgaon. Hence, we gave a subjectwise and classwise and districtwise analysis so that the individual districts can draw up an action plan,” Kathmore added.

Oaths were taken by two newly elected AAP councillors, Ram Chander from Rohini and Sunita Mishra from Shalimar Bagh. Leader of the Opposition Vikas Goel introduced a resolution condemning GNCTD (Amendment) Act, but mayor Jai Prakash objected to it citing that rules were not followed. Goel said that BJP’s defeat in the bypolls was indicative of the public mood. In response, leader of the House Yogesh Verma introduced a resolution condemning Delhi government for deducting loan interest from allocation of funds towards civic bodies. This resolution was passed by the House. Verma said that while on one hand Delhi government had reduced Rs 600 crore from the budgetary allocation of corporations despite an increase in expenses and revenue streams being hit due to the pandemic, on the other hand it was deducting interest on loans despite Delhi High Court’s directions to the contrary. He added that AAP members didn’t circulate their resolution, so it would not be considered as per the rules. Congress supported the AAP resolution against the GNCTD (Amendment) Act. The resolutions led to a ruckus with opposition members entering the well of the House. Meanwhile, the mayor announced that Rs 540 crore was being released to clear salary and pension arrears. He added that the rest of the pendency would be cleared by April. “Sanitation staff, domestic breeding checkers and nurses have received salaries till January, teachers have received three months’ pay, while the pendency for others has been cleared till January,” said Prakash. Malka Ganj councillor Guddi Devi entered the well with a bottle of kerosene threatening to self immolate if the number of sanitation workers was not increased in her ward. She claimed that the number of safai staff was reduced from 206 to 85 in 2018 and it was getting difficult to manage the situation. The mayor condemned the act saying she was blackmailing and compromising the safety of House members. He assured to resolve the problem in the next two days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/self-immolation-drama-slogans-mark-house-meet/articleshow/81768481.cms||Paras Singh

The chairpersons, who were appointed for a one-year term in 2020 January, would have gotten a two-year extension had the state election commission (SEC) not declared the election schedule for local bodies. The government had kept the renewal of many market committees in abeyance following the enforcement of model code of conduct due to the elections to village panchayats and municipalities. Several market committee chiefs lost their posts after the local body elections as the legislators found them to be working against party interests. The market committee chief’s post is considered lucrative and a key post after the legislator in the constituency. For instance, Darsi legislator Maddisetty Venugopal got a local leader Vennapusa Gopal Reddy appointed as market committee chairperson last year. Although, the government wanted to reserve Darsi market chief’s post to the ST category, the MLA prevailed upon the party leadership and got the reservation changed to accommodate Gopal Reddy as market committee chief. Surprisingly, Gopal Reddy started working against the legislator immediately after getting the top post. He joined former legislator Buchepalli Sivaprasada Reddy’s camp and tried to defeat candidates fielded by Venugopal in the panchayat elections. Venugopal replaced Gopal Reddy with youth leader I Venugopal Reddy of Thallur. The MLA gave vice-chairman post to Shaik Hussain of Darsi town which is expected to consolidate his base in the constituency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/mkt-committee-chiefs-ousted-for-going-against-ysrc-in-local-body-polls/articleshow/81748700.cms||Samdani MN

All cinema halls (single screens and multiplexes), malls, auditoriums and restaurants in the state have been ordered to remain closed from 8pm to 7am. Multiplexes that were looking forward to resuming at 100% capacity have now been left high and dry with the early closing deadline, that too at an operational capacity of 50%. Prakash Chaphalkar, secretary of the Multiplex Association of India, told TOI, “The multiplexes will bring down the number of operational screens after the restricted deadline. However, it would not be feasible. Since commitments have been made, we are screening whatever is available. Anyway, multiplexes are getting 10% of footfalls even at 50% operational capacity.”Another multiplex chain source told TOI, “The 8pm closing deadline will mean that our last show ends at 6pm. This will translate to losing two shows per screen. Losing a prime time slot is definitely going to be a blow. After months of lockdown last year, producers were a little optimistic about releasing bigger content now. But with such restrictions and announcement of a possible lockdown, we are apprehensive about bigger movie releases being postponed. This would impact the entire supply chain.”A representative of a popular mall in the city said, “Malls will hardly have any footfalls now with the restricted deadline. Footfalls had already dropped as Covid cases started increasing. But the 8pm closing deadline has come as a big blow. 80% of mall business happens during the evening hours. This business has now been taken away.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mall-multiplex-operators-rue-80-loss-of-business/articleshow/81749502.cms||Neha Madaan

---||Pune||Hoteliers say another shutdown will lead to closure of 4k restos||Pune: Over 4,000 restaurants in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad and many from Maharashtra might close down for good if another lockdown is imposed, hospitality industry representatives told TOI on Monday. Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad roughly have 8,200 restaurants, while the number is around 1 lakh in Maharashtra. During the pandemic, around 300 restaurants in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad have closed down following failures to recover the economic losses caused by the numerous restrictions. Ganesh Shetty, president of the Pune Restaurants and Hoteliers Association (PRAHA), told TOI that a day of the 8pm closing deadline on Sunday resulted in close to Rs15 crore loss for restaurants in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad. “The 8pm deadline is already a death knell for the restaurants as 80% of business happens in the evening. A lot of restaurants are contemplating closure as taking away evening business hours means that we cannot recover the costs, including overheads. The Covid mortality rate is currently lower than last year’s peak infection period. The disease is now showing signs of becoming endemic, with many asymptomatic cases. A lockdown in such a scenario is not the answer.” Sherry Bhatia, president of the Hotel and Restaurant Association of Western India (HRAWI) told TOI, “Already restaurants in parts of Marathwada region, where several restrictions have been announced recently, are fearing huge financial losses. The losses are putting a lot of burden on the industry.” In several areas on Sunday, police started cracking down on restaurants, preventing some eateries in Kothrud, Tilak Road, Camp, Karve road from doing parcel services after 8 pm. “The latest state and civic body orders had allowed parcel services beyond 8 pm. However, the police came to our restaurant in Kothrud and began telling us to close the entire facility, including the kitchen at 8:30pm. Orders from the top are not reaching those on field,” a restaurateur from Kothrud said. “We have now started vaccinations of a chunk of population, even when over 90% cases are asymptomatic. A year into the pandemic, the health machinery is now more geared up to tackle Covid cases. That is why a lockdown or more restrictions are not needed,” PRAHA vice-president Vikram Shetty said. Another restaurateur said, “ Another lockdown will be disastrous for us, as we still have not recovered losses from the initial lockdown.” Restaurants and lounges are currently trying to keep losses at bay by increasing operation hours to full day till 8 pm instead of closing from 3:30pm till 7pm, as was the norm before the recent restrictions were imposed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/hoteliers-say-another-shutdown-will-lead-to-closure-of-4k-restos/articleshow/81749506.cms||Neha Madaan

On Sunday, 22 patients were admitted to the hospital, the highest single-day admissions this year. Another three refused admission. The names of those who refuse admission are emailed to the district collector, and they choose either home isolation or the Covid care centre at their own risk. The average daily admissions to the hospital, which hovered between five to eight patients last month, has now risen to 14. Its active cases have also doubled. Until last month, the hospital had an occupancy of around 40 cases. This number has risen to over 80 active cases. Most patients admitted are middle-aged. There are also some elderly persons, along with young people who have comorbidities. The hospital has patients in the ICU, in the obstetrics and gynaecology ward, as well as children in the paediatric ward. “Up to last month, there were around 100 patients admitted every two weeks,” a junion doctor told TOI. “We are now seeing 100 admissions every week. Cases are galloping. We are slowly returning to what we experienced in October.” The moderate to severe cases are treated at the hospital, while critical cases are referred to GMC. From panic admissions last year, people have come to take the pandemic lightly and even refuse admission, doctors say. “I feel people have lost their seriousness about Covid-19. You see huge crowds everywhere, whether at market places or festivals, where people don’t wear masks. We must treat this as a dangerous disease and win this war,” a doctor said. The recent elections also saw public figures flouting all Covid-19 protocols of wearing masks and following social distancing, putting several vulnerable people at risk. “We are a young population, and the bulk of those under the age of 45 hasn’t been vaccinated yet,” the doctor said. “We cannot be complacent until the vaccination is sorted out. There’s no point in getting Covid and creating unnecessary illnesses.” “It’s better to take care until everybody is vaccinated. Vaccination won’t prevent one from getting Covid, but will decrease the severity of the disease. It is the only alternative now, and has proved to be pretty safe in Goa and the rest of the country,” the doctor added. “Nurses and doctors are exhausted and physically and mentally drained,” another doctor said. “It’s time people become Covid warriors and put themselves in our shoes and give us a break.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/south-goa-district-hospital-sees-rise-in-admissions/articleshow/81750360.cms||Lisa Monteiro

It was a cumbersome process, even if the sporting director for the Indian Blind Football Federation (IBFF) had to source a ball from neighbouring Pakistan where they were being manufactured. There were permissions to be obtained, and then a long wait. Now, it’s easy. Vector X, an Indian sports goods company, has launched Sound Ball, a football with sound that intends to make the beautiful game accessible to all. The Sound Ball is developed based on extensive trials and player feedback with the IBBF’s assistance. “For the game of blind football, you have to be guided by sound, otherwise it’s impossible to know where the ball is,” Mathew, also the India coach, told TOI on Tuesday. “The ball has got little bells inside and doesn’t fly around. The bells allow the players to be guided towards the ball. Previously, we were using balls from Brazil, Spain, Pakistan, but now we have these made in India itself.” In the past, the IBBF tried procuring the ball from a Meerut-based company but the supply was much less than the demand. “We couldn’t even get 10 (balls) a year. We have a huge number of (visually-challenged) footballers, around 600 of them, both men and women. These new balls are of great help,” said Mathew, who has motivated, mentored and coached a talented pool of visually-challenged people. Blind football is a 5-a-side game with four players and one goalkeeper. The game took shape in India in 2013. The Sound Ball is made with soft PU leather and fitted with a mechanical sound device to assist visually-challenged footballers who depend on their hearing skills to play. The in-built six sound devices fixed under the ball’s hexagon panels create a sound that guides them. The hand-stitched ball has a low bounce bladder to allow for better game control. “'India is a hub of potential that goes undiscovered primarily due to a lack of inclusivity and resources. With this Sound Ball, we hope to encourage all those skilled individuals, who may have been held back because of these restrictions,” said Shaalini Gupta, a member of the board of directors of Soccer Group India. India’s visually-challenged footballers have already started using the Sound ball with the national team in Kochi now preparing for the friendly tour of Oman later this year. “The earlier footballs were a bit expensive. This is much cheaper. More footballers will be able to use the ball now,” said Mathew.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/indias-blind-footballers-get-a-sound-ball-of-their-own/articleshow/81767219.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

Azmi’s letter to Thackeray, copies of which have been sent to the governor, minority department minister and secretary of minority department, said people with criminal cases against them may try to enter Maharashtra State Urdu Sahitya Academy, which may get constituted again. “People with proven literary credentials alone should be considered for secretary and members of the academy.

The resolution was introduced by leader of the House Yogesh Verma in the councillors’ meeting on Tuesday. He said that this was a private member’s resolution and since the House had passed it, it would now be mandatory for the public health department to bring a policy in this regard. “We will pass the policy thereby formalising the regulations,” he added. “A total of 104 wards across six administrative zones of north corporation have hundreds of restaurants, eateries and meat shops, out of which 90% serve meat in their establishment. But these places do not display if they are serving halal meat or jhatka meat,” the resolution said. It added that “the halal meat is forbidden and against religion in Hinduism and Sikhism.” “Because according to the Hinduism and Sikhism religion, eating halal meat is forbidden and anti-religion and because as per the limits (maryada) of Sikhism, the halal meat is forbidden, this meeting of North Delhi Municipal Corporation resolves and directs the municipal commissioner to ensure that directions are issued to the hotels, restaurants, dhabas and meat shops under the jurisdiction of the north corporation to clearly and mandatorily write if the meat being served is halal meat or jhatka meat,” the resolution stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/n-corporation-also-makes-meat-label-mandatory/articleshow/81768493.cms||Paras Singh
---||Coimbatore||Daily spike in Covid cases crosses 200-mark||Coimbatore: The district recorded its highest single-day spike in Covid-19 cases this year on Monday, when 211 people tested positive for the virus. This is a five-fold increase from the caseload in March first week, when the number of fresh cases was limited to anywhere between 40 and 45. It is also the highest single-day spike that the district has recorded since November second week. The number of active cases in the district has also shot up to 1,290 on the day, even as 93 patients were discharged from treatment centres after recovery. The Covid-19 toll, meanwhile, went up to 691, with two more patients succumbing to the virus in the past couple of days. Among the deceased was a 38-year-old man with hypertension. He was admitted to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital on March 18. He died of bilateral bronchopneumonia on March 26. The other victim was a 70-year-old woman, who was hospitalized on March 24 with breathing difficulty, fever and cough. She died on March 28. The district is, meanwhile, running out of vaccines – it is now short of both Covishield and Covaxin. While the CMCH had completely run out of Covaxin last week itself, many private hospitals have only less than 60 doses, which they are offering to VIPs and their own staff or people who require a second dose. “We don’t have Covaxin at all now and have asked for a fresh stock, that too only to offer second doses,” said a CMCH official. According to a source, only 1,000 doses of the indigenously developed vaccine are available at the district storage unit. “They will be offered to people who need to take their second dose.” The district administration is left with no other option, but to prioritize people aged above 45 years for vaccination. “We have been asked to vaccinate only people aged above 45,” said a spokesperson of a private hospital on Avinashi Road. While the district administration said 9,808 people were vaccinated on Monday, an official, who didn’t want to be identified, said the actual figure was around 60% of that. “The number of people getting vaccinated a day has come down to 5,000 from more than 8,000 in March second week, because of the vaccine shortage.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/daily-spike-in-covid-cases-crosses-200-mark/articleshow/81750320.cms||---

The issue was raised by multiple councillors during the House meeting on Tuesday prompting mayor Jai Prakash to direct the horticulture department to prevent further sealing. The civic body has also decided to file a review petition in National Green Tribunal to allow borewells in parks till alternative arrangements were made, Leader of the House Yogesh Verma said. The civic body manages 6,095 municipal parks spread over 2,158 acres. The horticulture department in its official response stated that 1,870 borewells had been installed to irrigate the 6,095 parks. “According to the NGT order, all the parks in the 5km radius of STPs were to be irrigated with treated wastewater. As many as 16 tankers are being used to bring water to these parks now,” it stated. According to reports, 147 parks have been affected in Narela, 52 in Rohini, 84 in Civil Lines, 10 in Karol Bagh, 19 in city Sadarpaharganj and 89 in Keshavpuram zones. Verma said DJB should have made proper arrangement to bring treated wastewater to parks before the sealing drive. Leader of Congress in House Mukesh Goel said the NGT order were given over one-and-a-half-years ago when the current mayor used to be the standing committee chief, and no steps were taken to make alternative arrangements.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/99-borewells-feeding-401-parks-sealed/articleshow/81768515.cms||Paras Singh

Though Jose had retracted from his earlier statement on Love Jihad after he was censured by the CPM leadership, the Catholic Church is keen to keep the topic alive. However, the initial statement by Jose could turn beneficial for him in Pala where the majority of voters are Christians. The CPM’s displeasure on Jose K Mani’s remarks came out when chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan evaded questions on Love Jihad in Kannur on Monday. He said that he hasn’t listened to what Jose had said and asked reporters to ask Jose about what he meant. A little later Jose somersaulted from his earlier stand and said, “The stand of the KC(M) is the same as that of the LDF and the Left government. The development projects implemented by the LDF government in the last five years have to be discussed in the elections. It has been well accepted. The confusion has been created to divert attention from the acceptance which the government has got.” He chose not to mention the word Love Jihad.

The CPM and the LDF have been all along maintaining that the Love Jihad is non-existent in the state and that it is a creation of the Sangh Parivar. The statement of Jose has now put the CPM in a Catch 22 situation as the Kerala Catholic Bishop Council (KCBC), the apex body of the bishops of various Catholic rites in Kerala, has also come in support of Jose’s earlier statement of making clarity on Love Jihad.

The commission should not have waited for someone to find out the massive discrepancies. On the charges levelled by the election commission that he should not have come out with discrepancies at the eleventh hour, Chennithala said it was not humanly possible to find out the massive rigging made in the voters’ list in a day. “It took months to analyze the list and find out the discrepancies,” he said. He alleged that now it has become evident that LDF had won the local body elections with a rigged voters list. “CPM is purely behind the rigging of the voters’ list and it has been done with the knowledge of Pinarayi Vijayan,” said Chennithala. He alleged that the same type of rigging is being done in the postal ballots too. Massive irregularities have been found in getting the votes through the postal ballots meant for people who are aged above 80 years. Congress has filed several complaints to the election commission regarding this. In Thiruvananthapuram constituency, postal ballots have been issued to eight people who have died. We have submitted the details of these ballots to the EC. “The election commission should ensure a transparent, free and fair poll,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/ec-should-ensure-free-and-fair-polls-says-chennithala/articleshow/81749519.cms||---

---||Goa||Stimac should not have made so many changes: Colaco||Panaji: Three days before India’s friendly against United Arab Emirates, there was a flutter in the Indian camp with a debutant testing positive for Covid-19. Nobody knew how he got the infection. Nobody else had it, not even his roommate. But another test – result of which was available five hours before kickoff – turned out to be negative. There was a sigh of relief. Only momentarily. At the end of the second international friendly against UAE in Dubai on Monday, the mood had soured again as the hosts hammered six past a hapless-looking Indian team. India had managed a fighting 1-1 draw against higher-ranked Oman last week, but UAE proved too hot to handle as they handed Igor Stimac’s side their worst defeat since a 1-9 loss against Kuwait in 2010. “Stimac should not have made so many changes, particularly when you play an international friendly against a strong opposition like UAE,” former India coach Armando Colaco told TOI on Tuesday. “India played like novices. Friendly games are good, but you need to show faith in one set (of players). The coach has seen these players in the ISL, they were there for the camp, so you must pick your best team and keep faith in them.” Stimac handed India debuts to 10 players in the first friendly, six of them in the starting lineup. They struggled to find their feet at the start, but the draw was encouraging. In the next friendly, Stimac continued with his experiments and made eight changes, including three in defence where Akash Mishra and Mashoor Shereef had less than 90 minutes of international experience between them. “I was not very happy after the 1-1 draw against Oman and this big loss against UAE doesn’t disappoint me,” said Subhash Bhowmick, among the more successful club coaches in India. “Let us not forget that Indian football is rebuilding. These young boys when they can play so well in ISL, given a chance, given proper platform, they will do better on the international stage.” The hammering against UAE was among the worst for Indian football. There have been heavy defeats– against Japan (7-0 and 6-0), Saudi Arabia (7-1), Kuwait (9-1) – since the turn of the century, but worryingly Stimac is now without a win in 10 matches. His real test will be in June when India resume their campaign in the Fifa World Cup 2022 qualifiers. They must win at least two of their three remaining games -- against Qatar, Bangladesh and Afghanistan -- for a direct spot in the third round of the Asian Cup 2023 qualifiers. Sources said Stimac will assemble the probables again in April for another camp with players like Brandon Fernandes, Seriton Fernandes, Rahul Bheke, Ashish Rai, Sahal Abdul Samad – all nursing injuries – expected to return, while experienced Sunil Chhetri, who missed the friendlies due to Covid-19, and Udanta Singh will provide options. “I have seen top players of Indian football conceding six goals. I’ve conceded six goals myself. I am sure the team will bounce back,” said Bhowmick. Another six-goal hammering anytime soon, though, will be hard to digest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/stimac-should-not-have-made-so-many-changes-colaco/articleshow/81767247.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

They have appealed the state power utility to disconnect the electricity connection to the brick kilns at the earliest as per the court order.The district Irular Samooga Nala Sangam has written to Tangedco chairman, principal secretary of the energy department and executive engineers in the district about the delay in disconnecting power supply to the illegal brick kilns in complete disregard for the Madras high court orders on January 6 and February 10.N Mallan, president, Irular Samooga Nala Sangam, said the illegal brick kilns, which were operating at night, were employing heavy machinery and powering the foothills with flood lights.Tribals said the night activity and lights were disturbing wild elephants, which were increasingly running into Anaikatti and surrounding villages and farms, endangering people’s lives and damaging crops.“Tangedco has to disconnect power supply to the illegal brick kilns and fine them for using agriculture electricity connection for industrial purposes and making electricity poles inaccessible by digging around them,” Mallan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/tribals-slam-tangedco-for-not-disconnecting-power-to-brick-kilns/articleshow/81750345.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

BJP was left without a candidate in Thalassery after the nomination papers of its candidate N Haridas was rejected by the returning officer during scrutiny for not having the signature of party national president in Form-A. BJP decision to support Nazeer came on Monday after CM Pinarayi Vijayan said that a prominent BJP leader’s comment, to vote for the UDF candidate in Guruvayur and against the LDF candidate in Thalassery, was enough to show that there is a Co-Le-B (Congress, League, BJP) alliance in state. Announcing the decision in Kasaragod, BJP state president K Surendran said Nazeer, who faced a bid on his life for questioning the CPM leadership, was the best candidate to lay bare CPM’s political violence and dictatorial tendencies before the public. The former municipal councillor had left CPM after he had some difference of opinion with the party leadership. He had contested 2019 parliamentary elections as an independent from Vadakara. Barely a month after polls, he was allegedly attacked by CPM workers and Nazeer had raised allegations against MLA AN Shamseer in connection with the incident. “Our party workers and supporters will vote for Nazeer, help his campaign and seek votes for him,” Surendran said. When contacted, Nazeer said that his candidature was against political violence and developmental backwardness of the constituency and that he would welcome all support. He added that he would always remain secular. Meanwhile in Kannur, referring to BJP leader Suresh Gopi’s statements without naming him, Vijayan said that the comments indicated that ‘an extensive form of the old Co-Le-B alliance’ was prevailing in state. “A prominent BJP leader, who is also a candidate, said that KNA Khadar should win at Guruvayur and Shamseer shouldn’t win at Thalassery. These are two among the three seats in which they calculated that BJP candidates were not necessary for the victory of UDF,” he said, adding that the comment was not unintentional. He said that everyone knows this person isn’t a seasoned politician. “He is one of the main persons in BJP. So, he knows how the party thinks. Other leaders under usual circumstances would not be ready to reveal such secrets. This person was unable to maintain his watchfulness. He basically revealed the real stand of his party,” said Vijayan. He recalled that BJP leader O Rajagopal had said that existing local-level adjustments should continue. “Last time, they won Nemom. BJP had no issue in giving votes to UDF candidate in the neighbouring constituency to ensure a victory. They were able to open accounts in the assembly with the help of UDF. That was a gain for BJP,” said the CM. Meanwhile in Kasaragod, IUML leader PK Kunhalikutty responded to Vijayan’s comment saying that UDF was taking on BJP where the party is strong and Left’s performance against that party was limited to lip service. “Those who have a fear of failure need topics like love jihad. UDF doesn’t need BJP support,” he said. Vijayan added that the present talk shouldn’t be seen as something done for the betterment of IUML or UDF. “They (BJP) in the long run are thinking about gains. It shows that the business deal is done in a constituency, where League has influence. League, Congress and UDF have taken up the task of letting BJP win through foul play at places where BJP has a good vote share; but people are not ready to let them win,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/co-le-b-real-or-cms-imagination/articleshow/81749523.cms||---

On behalf of the traders of Pune, our request is that no action be taken against any traders tallying the balance and the stock after the shutters are pulled down,” said Ranka. The federation has given a letter to the commissioner of police. “We have received the PMC’s order stating that all shops will remain open till 8 pm. It means we must pull down the shutters at 8pm. After that, we have to take stock and keep jewellery in the strong room before leaving the premises,” Ranka said in the letter. He said, “All businesses have been badly affected and nowadays it is a problem of survival. The traders are not in a position to pay their EMIs.” The federation also appealed to traders to complete their daily work by 7pm. They should also make sure that the staff members leave the workplace by 7.30 pm, so that they can reach home by 8pm. Madhav Jagtap, the head of PMC’s anti-encroachment department, said they had formed 30 squads to act against the rule violators. “These squads would be placed across 15 ward offices. Each squad would have 4-5 people,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/dont-take-action-against-traders-checking-balance-after-closing-shops-at-8pm-biz-body/articleshow/81749525.cms||---

Fast forward to March 2021, you find people have begun treating Covid-19 like the common cold leading to late diagnosis and a missed opportunity of getting cured. Since Goa started witnessing a rise in infections this month, the mortality count has increased, and on most days, two Covid-related deaths are reported. The two deaths a day for a daily average of over 100 cases is not to be taken lightly, said Dr S M Bandekar, dean of Goa Medical College (GMC). “Rising mortalities is a cause for concern because people’s attitude has changed towards Covid-19. People stay at home for the first five to six days suffering from breathlessness. While last year people came running to the hospital even if they had a mild fever. They think Covid-19 is a common flu and they will be cured without getting medical help. This is a dangerous behavioural pattern,” said Bandekar. Probably, people have been emboldened since the recovery rate has been high. Goa’s Covid-19 recovery rate has been in the range of 96-97% for the past few months. “People think nothing will happen, even if they contract Covid-19,” Bandekar, who is also the head of the Covid hospitals in the state, said. Over the past few days, some of the people who died of Covid were in the age group of 30 to 50 years. In most cases, the victim did not have any comorbidities. Besides reporting late for treatment, some were brought dead to the hospital, or a few hours before they succumbed. Such cases were reported both at South Goa district hospital and GMC. “When a patient’s history is examined, and relatives questioned, they deny that the patient had any symptoms of the virus,” he said. On Sunday, a 30-year-old woman from Saligao died after contracting the virus. The only comorbidity she suffered from was anaemia, an easy comorbidity that could have been treated. Earlier this week, a 35-year-old man from Chinchinim was declared brought dead to Hospicio, Margao.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/people-treating-covid-like-flu-ignoring-timely-treatment-gmc-dean/articleshow/81750404.cms||Bindiya Chari

Counterfeit currency notes totalling around Rs 9 lakh had been recovered in the case. Refusing to grant leniency to the accused, the court said it could not lose sight of the fact that offences of trafficking of forged or counterfeit currency notes posed a challenge to the economy. “The courts are supposed to be sensitive in dealing with such offences. The rapid-changing technology in the process of counterfeiting, sale or trafficking transactions, which virtually amount to waging a financial war against the country, cannot be lost sight of while interpreting such penal provisions,” the court observed. The court said the prosecution had proved the accused conspired the commission of a terrorist act “to traffic and circulate fake Indian currency notes to threaten the security and sovereignty of India by disruption of the supply and service essential to the life of the community in India and to destabilize the economy.” The accused were acquitted under sections of the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) as sanction for their prosecution under it was not received. Those convicted include Malik Shaikh, Raghavendra Singh, Mohamed Shaikh, Mohamed Jalal, Asarul Shaikh, Taufiq Nawaz, Rabiul Shaikh and Mohamed Mansur Alam. The accused have been in jail since their arrests in 2014. Their sentence will be set off against this period. Among those named in the case is also a minor who will be tried separately. Chief public prosecutor Jaysing Desai cited the deposition of 35 witnesses to seek the conviction of the accused. It was the prosecution’s case on June 4, 2014, the anti-terrorism squad (ATS) received information that Malik from Odisha who deals with fake currency notes would come to a restaurant in Bandra. A trap was laid and he was arrested later in the night after a search showed he was carrying fake currency notes. Then, the other accused were held and more fake currency was recovered from them. The accused denied the allegations and said they had been falsely implicated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/8-sent-to-jail-for-10-years-in-fake-currency-case-in-mumbai/articleshow/81748298.cms||Rebecca Samervel

---||Goa||With no campus, all-India rank of students at IIT-Goa dropping||PANAJI: The uncertainty over land for a permanent campus for the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Goa, could be damaging the institute more than previously imagined. Student data shows that over the past three years, the students opting to join IIT-Goa are those with lower and lower all-India ranks at JEE (Advanced). In 2020, IIT-Goa saw the lowest-ranked student joining the institute since its establishment in 2016. The student, ranked past 10,000, joined the BTech programme in mechanical engineering last year. The best all-India rank to join IIT-Goa in mechanical engineering last year 2020 was 8,594. Two years earlier, the best-ranked student to join mechanical engineering had an all-India standing of 5,745. In the first couple of years after the IIT was established, the scene was quite different. The brand Goa, with its good living conditions, favourable weather and beautiful landscapes had led students to opt for this institute over some of the much sought-after older campuses. Even in 2019, when it seemed a permanent campus was within reach, with land finalised for the project at Guleli in Sattari, the best-ranked students to join IIT had an all-India standing of 2,495. The student joined computer science and engineering. Within a year, in 2020, the best rank to opt for computer science and engineering at IIT Goa was down to 3,098 at JEE. “This (lower-ranked students opting for IIT Goa) could be due to many factors. One factor that cannot be ignored is the lack of amenities. Campus is a very important component of the growth and development of students,” IIT-Goa director BK Mishra told TOI. Last year saw the eruption of protests at Guleli against the project, which eventually led to the state government withdrawing the IIT project from the village. A team has now been formed to identify new sites for the IIT. And while chief minister Pramod Sawant had announced that a new site for IIT Goa would be declared by end of March, with two days left for the month to end, there has been little progress. “Uncertainty over land is creating doubts in the minds of the students. At present, you do not know if you would have a campus even 10 years from now. I am sure that if land for a campus is announced tomorrow, the ranking of students opting (for IIT-Goa) will immediately go up,” said Mishra. The first batch of students from IIT-Goa graduated last year from the temporary campus at Farmagudi, and a second batch is set to graduate soon this year, without any of the experiences that come with studying at a full-fledged IIT campus. Pitching IIT-Goa to parents of a new batch set to join the institute soon from July, Mishra said, “I would recommend IIT-Goa to parents because the environment Goa offers is much better for students”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/with-no-campus-all-india-rank-of-students-at-iit-goa-dropping/articleshow/81750436.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

Both BJP and Congress state chiefs could be seen playing Holi without masks or social distancing.Congress state chief Pritam Singh celebrated Holi by showering flowers on supporters at the party office in Dehradun. In a similar scene, BJP state chief Madan Kaushik celebrated the festival with party leaders and workers. A video of the event is doing rounds on social media. Neither leader was seen wearing masks or maintaining social distancing. According to sources, thermal screening was not conducted for the guests at these events, who were also without masks. Notably, the SOP released by the state administration for Holi celebrations has banned the use of loudspeakers and gatherings of more than 100 people at one place. These rules were flouted at most places, mostly at political events where the festival was celebrated. Both the ruling BJP as well as the Opposition Congress had issued statements before Holi, asking people to stay safe during the festival of colours and follow government SOPs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/political-parties-throw-caution-to-the-wind-at-holi-parties-in-doon/articleshow/81767263.cms||---

There was concern that the stalls set up by over 500 artisans and craftsmen from 30 countries would attract crowds and worsen the spurt in Covid-19 cases. However, the controlled environment and strict SOPs under which the exhibition-cum-sale is being held has possibly set an example for organisation of other events during the pandemic. For participating artisans too, the pandemic brought with it difficult times, as for many other sectors. With the organisation of events like this exhibition, the artisans said, they saw hope of revival in their earnings, even though slow. Mohammad Khan from Delhi was in Goa last for the state art and culture department’s ‘Lok Utsav’ early last year. Within a month, the pandemic hit and sale of the ‘Swadeshi’ handlooms that he deals in went downhill. It brought tough times for him and his family. “There were massive footfalls at the ‘Lok Utsav’ and stalls did roaring business. Now, the footfall is not as much at ‘Hunar Haat’, but there are enough walk-ins for us to make good earnings. The systems in place are giving people the confidence to walk. It is a relief for us. The visitors increase after 5.30pm to enjoy the dance and music and food,” Khan said. Sanitisers have been provided after every 10 stalls for visitors at Hunar Haat. Strict thermal checking is carried out at the two entry points and visitors are allowed entry only if they are wearing masks correctly. It is also being ensured that those walking in are sanitising their hands before entry. Policemen, security guards and volunteers are also posted inside to make sure SOPs are followed by visitors. The stalls have also been placed in a manner that there is no crowding and sufficient place for multiple customers to shop with social distancing. “I deal in hand-stitched women’s clothing for which I have received good response. Some stalls are not doing as good. It depends on their product. There is a slow but good enough trickle of people. My stock is being sold off fast. The stock may not last till the last day on April 4,” said Shyamlal Mhaldar from Tripura. ‘Hunar Haat’ moves to different locations across the country to sell handicrafts and handlooms made by over five lakh artisans.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/with-strict-sops-in-place-hunar-haat-sets-an-example-for-events-to-be-held-during-pandemic/articleshow/81750447.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

A senior police officer said, "Terrorists swiftly attacked the meeting venue of councillors in which one councillor and security guard lost their lives." He said that the slain persons were identified as councillor Reyaz Ahmad Peer of Ningli in Sopore and SPO Shafqat Nazir Khan of Mundji in Sopore. He added that the two succumbed to injuries on the way to hospital. Eyewitnesses said that BJP councillor Riyaz Pir of Ningli, security guard of council chairman Masrat Kar and councillor Shamsuddin Pir of Jamia Qadeem Sopore sustained bullet injuries. Meanwhile, all political leaders, including former chief minister Omar Abdullah condemned the attack. Abdullah tweeted, "News coming in of a militant attack on the municipal office in Sopore. My unequivocal condemnation of this attack together with my sympathies for the deceased & prayers for the injured". Mayor of Srinagar city, Junaid Azim Mattu, also condemned in a tweet, “Strongly condemn the dastardly attack in Sopore where a Municipal Committee Councillor and a Policeman have lost their lives in the line of duty. My heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families, Allah Jannat Naseeb Karey Ameen”. “This inhuman attack on elected representatives of the people can fetch nothing except for bringing more chaos and agony to the people,” he added. Inspector General of Police, Kashmir Zone, Vijay Kumar, on Monday visited Sopore and inspected the spot where the attack took place. Officials said that the top police officer held a meeting with the Army’s sector commander, DIG (CRPF), and SSP, Sopore. “Local LeT terrorist Mudasir Pandit and one foreign militant are involved in attack,” the IGP said. However, he said, investigation is going on. “Cordon-and-searches-operations were launched at two locations immediately,” he said. Moreover, the IGP said that he has directed the Sopore SSP to suspend 4 PSOs, who were present at the spot and didn’t retaliate appropriately.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/let-attacks-civic-office-in-jk-kills-bjp-neta-spo/articleshow/81751234.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||Goa||‘Govt acquired land to benefit PWD AE’s wife’||Panaji: In a case pertaining to land acquisition at Betalbatim, the high court of Bombay at Goa recently pulled up a special land acquisition officer as the land acquisition for a 6m-wide road would serve only one household, belonging to the wife of a PWD assistant engineer. Maria Platilda Afonzo e Dias had challenged a notification issued for acquiring the land for a road at Betalbatim. Senior counsel Saresh Lotlikar, who appeared for the petitioner, argued that land acquisition notifications are vitiated as they constitute colourable exercise of power of acquisition by the government. He said the proposed road does not serve any public purpose, but the acquisition was for a private purpose to provide an access road to the property of Ramila Cecilia Gerson Rebelo e Barros, wife of Agnelo Regis Barros, the PWD AE. “It appears that the said acquisition will not serve public purpose but the private interest at the cost of the government exchequer,” stated a division bench comprising justices M S Sonak and M S Jawalkar. “Here the 6m-wide road is proposed and there is an objection that only one household will be benefitted,” the court added  The court noted that in spite of serious allegations about the benefit to only one person, the land acquisition officer did not bother to mention how many households are being benefited by the proposed road. The court said it therefore appeared to be merit in the contention that this would benefit only Ramila Barros. “It is nothing but a colourable exercise of power,” the court said. The high court stated that a government circular makes it clear that when it comes to the proposal for acquisition of road access, the acquiring department should ensure that at least 20 households must be benefitted for a 4m-wide road with length of less than 200m. “…The land acquisition officer did not bother to mention how many households are being benefited by the proposed road of 6m,” the high court held. “We fail to understand... how the acquisition of this stretch of land will serve the public purpose or fill the gap as clamed,” the court stated. Counsel for the state, Sagar Dhargalkar, argued that the acquisition was in the interest of the public at large.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-acquired-land-to-benefit-pwd-aes-wife/articleshow/81750448.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Hyderabad||Jawaharnagar plant plan in Centre’s court||HYDERABAD: A proposal to put up an additional power plant at Jawaharnagar dump yard is now in the Centre’s court. State Environmental Impact Assessment Authority expert appraisal committee has sent a proposal to set up another power plant of 19.8MW at Jawaharnagar dump yard to the Union ministry of environment stating that with the existing 19.8MW power plant, it would exceed 20MW. GHMC has sent the additional power plant proposal to the committee for environmental clearance. The state expert appraisal committee on March 26 decided to refer it to the Centre. Ramky Enviro Engineers SPV in November 2020 had commissioned the 19.8 MW waste-to-energy power plant in first phase at Jawaharnagar. GHMC said the dump yard has potential to generate 98 MW by 2025. TS Transco has entered into a power purchase agreement with the company. GHMC has also submitted a proposal for EC with the ministry of environment for expansion of ‘Integrated Municipal Solid Waste Management Project’ from 19.8 MW to 48 MW. The report submitted by the project proponent says, “In 2013, EC was given reducing the capacity to 19.8 MW. In the latest proposal, two blocks of waste-to-energy power plants – each with 24 MW capacity — has been put forth. The area allocated for municipal solid waste-based waste-to-energy power plant is 31.5 acres of 351 acres. The cost of the proposed project is around Rs 720 crores. The process of water requirement for the proposed project is 1,425 KLD and the source of water is HMWS&SB or borewells within the site. The ash generated from the proposed project is around 670 TPD, and it could be used for land filling, cement or brick manufacturing. “The power required for operations is 7200 kW and the source is from TS Transco. Once the power plant is fully operational, power requirement will be met from the same and excess will be interconnected to TSTransco substation at Malkaram. The budget proposed for implementation of environment protection measures is Rs 75 crore, while Rs 7.5 crore per annum is recurring cost. The project provides job opportunities to around 400 persons,” the proposal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/jawaharnagar-plant-plan-in-centres-court/articleshow/81749527.cms||---

The victims were asleep when the fire spread from the grocery shop, killing Gangubai Moule (78), daughter-in-law Dwarka (46) and grandchildren Pallavi (15) and Krishna (10). Shop-owner Anant (51), who was asleep in another room, suffered head injuries and is being treated at Mokhada rural hospital. His children Bhavesh (17) and Ashwini (17) were rescued by a neighbour, who entered the room through a window. The injured children were shifted to Nashik civil hospital. Mokhada police said the fire, which broke out around 2.30am, originated from the shop, in the front. The family was asleep in the house. By the time Anant noticed the fire it had engulfed the shop and moved into the room. As the exit from the room was through the shop, the family got trapped inside. Fire brigade personnel contained the fire within an hour. Preliminary investigations suggest a short-circuit caused the fire. The district has been experiencing intense heat for few days. A case of accidental death was registered and statements of survivors are yet to be recorded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/mumbai2-kids-among-four-of-family-killed-in-fire-in-palghar/articleshow/81750453.cms||Sandhya Nair

According to Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) released by the Champawat district administration, it is mandatory for visitors to carry RT-PCR reports and register themselves online. Due to the pandemic, the daily limit of visitors at the event has been capped to 10,000 and its duration has been curtailed to one month (it’s usually a three-month long affair). “People from states like UP, Haryana, Delhi and Madhya Pradesh come to Purnagiri to seek the blessings of the deity at the shrine here. After praying at Purnagiri shrine, devotees go to the Siddhanath Mandir Baramdev, Nepal,”said Bhuwan Pande, priest at Purnagiri. “Registering themselves will let pilgrims visit the Siddhanath temple in Nepal but if they want to explore more of the country, they will have to register in a separate app of Nepalese authorities,” said SDM Purnagiri Himanshu Kafaltiya.

---||Kochi||Two poster-boys duel in a three-cornered fight||THRITHALA: If there’s a campaign anywhere in Kerala that is high-octane, evenly matched and symbolic of the future, it is probably in Thrithala constituency, located on the banks of Bharathapuzha in Palakkad district and bordering Malappuram. With its highly educated and savvy voters, Thrithala is seeing a clash of three young men, two of whom — UDF’s V T Balaram and LDF’s M B Rajesh — reflect the cream of Kerala’s politically committed youth and, perhaps more crucially, how polarised they are. Both seek votes in the name of life and livelihood issues, they dwell sufficiently on mega matters and, of course, both try hard to work their considerable charm on the unaffiliated. Acutely aware of each other’s potential, and how little would separate the eventual winner, has added an element of intensity, colour and pique (clue: Balaram’s infamous rant against AKG) to the contest here, probably unmatched in any other constituency. The NDA candidate Shanku T Das may not be right up there in his opponents’ league but he too is young and is a new face. And, where enthusiasm and hope is concerned, he is equal to Balaram and Rajesh. “The choice is between the devil and deep sea. Both fronts have abused the state and we will bring in a puthiya Keralam,” is his mantra. Two-time MLA, and looking for a hat-trick, Balaram is a very popular figure, known to one and all. He came in as a fresh face in this constituency in 2011 and upset the LDF’s calculations — he polled 57,848 votes with 47.4% vote share in 2011. But the margin of victory was just 3,197 votes over the CPM. As a first-term MLA, Balaram did a lot for his constituency, and in 2016 went on to win by more than 10,000 votes, riding against the LDF wave led by Pinarayi Vijayan. However, even as he increased his margin, the BJP vote share had also risen — to 10.3% — a factor that might prove crucial this time in deciding the outcome. Balaram’s main contention currently is that as an opposition MLA, the government machinery did not cooperate with his projects. “I had no cooperation from the local bodies. Every time I ask them about the status of my proposals, these panchayats would not follow it and keep giving excuses.” It was the UDF government which helped in the development of Thrithala constituency, he says. Balaram’s grouse has become Rajesh's weapon. He argues that as a legislator, one must keep pushing. “I got IIT Palakkad only because I persistently followed the various ministries. The problem with our MLA was that he was taking a political stance and opposing KIIFB funds for the projects. Look at Haripad or Puthuppally, they have huge projects with KIIFB funding,” he says. “Why is drinking water still a major problem here despite ten years of having the same MLA,” Rajesh asks. Having the advantage of parliamentary experience, CPM’s youth leader Rajesh is a familiar face of the party in TV and public discussions. “Our state government’s performance will help us. We have been there for the people in the worst of times,” he says. To which Balaram counters with charges of corruption, backdoor appointments and Nyay padathi which he says will bring in the much-needed development without huge public debt. The UDF is also raising the issue of safety of women and children — read the Walayar deaths — in its campaign. The fight is very close. Each vote will count in deciding the winner. One thing is guaranteed: This fight will go down to the wire and whoever wins, it will not reflect badly on the loser.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/two-poster-boys-duel-in-a-three-cornered-fight/articleshow/81749560.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

His father’s licensed pistol was lying nearby. He was immediately taken to a nearby private hospital, where he succumbed to the bullet injury,” said senior inspector Sudhakar Kate of the Chinchwad police.Pimpri Chinchwad’s assistant commissioner of police Sagar Kawade told TOI, “We have registered a case of accidental death for now and are ascertaining if it was a case of death by suicide. We are yet to record statements of his family members.”Referring to the initial information provided by the family members, Kate said, “Prasanna had dinner with his parents and younger brother in their bungalow in Chinchwadenagar. Later, his father went out as there was some issues related to water supply in the area. Prasanna went to his father’s room on the first floor, while his mother and younger brother were on the ground floor.”Kate said, “The family members told us that none of them heard any gunshot. It was only when the corporator returned home and went to his room that he saw Prasanna lying injured on the floor and his pistol lying nearby, the family told us.”Another officer from the Chinchwad police said, “The Chinchwade family was in a happy mood on Sunday. Prasanna, who had completed his diploma in engineering, wanted to start his own business. The family had booked a four-wheeler for him on Sunday.”The police checked Prasanna’s smartphone but found nothing to confirm that the latter had ended his life. Nor any suicide note was recovered from the site. “Prasanna had recently recovered from Covid-19,” said Kate.Prasanna’s father, Shekhar, was into a chit fund business. He had obtained a firearm licence citing his business. “We shall send a report to our higher-ups about his negligence pertaining to his firearm,” Kate said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pimpri-chinchwad-corporators-son-dies-of-bullet-injury/articleshow/81748917.cms||---

The civic administration had sent notices to over 7,300 property tax defaulters. The last date to pay the pending dues is March 31. The deputy commissioner of the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC), Smita Zagade, said that these 40 properties owed the civic body around Rs11 crore. “We had issued notices to over 300 defaulters, each having pending dues of Rs25 lakh or more. Of these, 40 properties were sealed. The owners of around three to four properties have paid dues worth Rs4 crore, following which we unsealed their properties. Payments from the others is still awaited,” Zagade said. She added that the civic administration was now focusing on the residential property owners, who were yet to pay their tax dues. “There are over 7,000 such properties, which have tax arrears of Rs1 lakh each and above. Water connections to such residential property owners would be cut,” she said. Zagade added that the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation had collected over Rs540 crore property tax this year, which was Rs70 crore more than the last fiscal year. According to Zagade, the tax collection figures for 2020-21 were higher compared to 2019 and 2018. “We will auction the vacant land plots that have been seized, if the defaulters fail to pay their tax dues within the stipulated deadline,” she added. Zagade added that the civic administration would continue to take action against the property tax defaulters even after March 31. The PCMC deputy commissioner appealed to the property tax defaulters to pay their tax dues at the earliest to avoid further fine on the dues if they did not pay within the stipulated deadline. The deputy commissioner said that they would have a word with the PCMC commissioner Rajesh Patil about the extension of the deadline for payment of dues. A proposal regarding the same would be sent to the Maharashtra government, Zagade added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pcmc-seals-40-properties-over-rs-25-lakh-tax-dues/articleshow/81748939.cms||Piyush Bhusari

A vacation bench of justices Ashok Bhushan and S Abdul Nazeer, which heard the matter on the day of Holi, said petitioner Jude Lobo has made out a “prima facie case” for the grant of anticipatory bail. The apex court is on Holi break this week. The top court was hearing a petition filed by the accused against a March 26 order of the Delhi high court, which rejected his anticipatory bail plea in the case. Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, who appeared for Lobo, told the court that the petitioner owns a restaurant in Goa. He referred to the WhatsApp chat record of December last year between the petitioner and the alleged victim. “We are satisfied that the petitioner has made out a prima facie case for grant of anticipatory bail. We direct that in event the petitioner is arrested, he shall be released on submitting a personal bond of Rs 10,000. The petitioner shall cooperate with the investigation,” the bench said in its order. “We have perused the first information report as well as the statement recorded by the prosecutrix under section 164 CrPC,” it said, adding, “The petitioner is permitted to implead the complainant as respondent no. 2. Amended memo be filed today itself. Issue notice.” The top court noted that the petitioner is an accused in an FIR registered at the Bhajanpura police station here under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), including 376 (rape). It noted that an application for anticipatory bail was filed before the trial court, which had, on February 27, granted interim protection to the petitioner that he shall not be arrested. Subsequently, the anticipatory bail plea was dismissed by the trial court on March 22, after which the petitioner had moved the high court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sc-sits-on-holi-grants-goa-man-anticipatory-bail/articleshow/81750451.cms||---

Police booked a case of negligence against the rider, who had a lucky escape due to the alert truck driver. The mishap occurred near Himayathnagar toll plaza in Rajendranagar on Monday morning. According to Rajendranagar police, a rider suddenly came on to the main road from a connecting lane, forcing the driver of one of the trucks to suddenly swerve the heavy vehicle to the right. “To avoid mowing down the rider who suddenly came across the road to take a U-turn, the truck driver turned the vehicle right and rammed into an oncoming truck. One of the trucks overturned after the crash and both the drivers sustained severe injuries,” Rajendranagar inspector K Kanakaiah said. Using the CCTV camera footage of the incident, which went viral on social media, police registered a case under Section 337 of the IPC. A manhunt has been launched to nab the rider who fled from the scene after the accident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/2-trucks-collide-biker-booked-for-causing-mishap/articleshow/81749531.cms||---

All cinema halls (single screens and multiplexes), malls, auditoriums and restaurants in the state have been ordered to remain closed from 8pm to 7am. Multiplexes that were looking forward to resuming at 100% capacity have now been left high and dry with the early closing deadline, that too at an operational capacity of 50%. Prakash Chaphalkar, secretary of the Multiplex Association of India, told TOI, “The multiplexes will bring down the number of operational screens after the restricted deadline. However, it would not be feasible. Since commitments have been made, we are screening whatever is available. Anyway, multiplexes are getting 10% of footfalls even at 50% operational capacity.” Another multiplex chain source told TOI, “The 8pm closing deadline will mean that our last show ends at 6pm. This will translate to losing two shows per screen. Losing a prime time slot is definitely going to be a blow. After months of lockdown last year, producers were a little optimistic about releasing bigger content now. But with such restrictions and announcement of a possible lockdown, we are apprehensive about bigger movie releases being postponed. This would impact the entire supply chain.” A representative of a popular mall in the city said, “Malls will hardly have any footfalls now with the restricted deadline. Footfalls had already dropped as Covid cases started increasing. But the 8pm closing deadline has come as a big blow. 80% of mall business happens during the evening hours. This business has now been taken away.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mall-multiplex-operators-rue-80-loss-of-business/articleshow/81749558.cms||Neha Madaan

He said due to a surge in Covid-19 cases, the government had decided to procure paddy in the villages as it was done last year. At a review meeting at Pragathi Bhavan on Monday, the CM instructed principal secretary (finance) K Ramakrishna Rao to make arrangements to give Rs 20,000 crore bank guarantee by Tuesday evening. He also asked chief secretary Somesh Kumar to hold a video-conference with all collectors immediately for setting up of the procurement centres. The CM said in 6,408 procurement centres, there are 2,131 IKP centres, 3,964 PACS centres and others 313. To ensure that they get minimum support price (MSP) at these centres, the CM told the farmers to see that the paddy they are bringing should have not more than 17 per cent moisture. He said for procuring the paddy, the officials should keep 20 crore gunny bags ready at the procurement centres. KCR said cotton produced in Telangana has a better price in the international market. “Since cotton produced in the state has better quality and commands a higher price as well as higher yield, farmers should be ready to grow cotton in 75 lakh to 80 lakh acres. Similarly, arrangements should also be made to cultivate red gram in 20 lakh to 25 lakh acres,” the CM said. In this summer season, paddy is cultivated in 52.76 lakh acres. He instructed the CS to identify land to be given on lease to the Central Warehousing Corporation as it is ready to construct additional godowns to store foodgrains. The CM also asked water resources department officials to ensure that Kaleshwaram water is supplied to the land under the irrigation projects for another 10 days so that crops would not go dry in Suryapet district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cheer-for-farmers-as-t-to-buy-paddy-at-6k-village-centres/articleshow/81750505.cms||Koride Mahesh

According to the GHMC, property tax collections till Sunday stood at Rs 1,543 crore. While this is reported to be the first time that the GHMC has crossed the Rs 1,500 crore mark, with just two days left for the last date, achieving the target of Rs 1,900 crore seems a tough task for the civic body. As per the tax collection data, out of the 16 lakh plus property tax assesses in the GHMC jurisdiction, 11.8 lakh property owners had paid the tax by Sunday. In terms of the circle-wise tax collection, Jubilee Hills saw a collection of Rs 163 crore, followed by Serilingampally at Rs 155 crore and Khairatabad at Rs 140 crore. To achieve the desired target, GHMC officials have requested property owners to clear the dues at the earliest and avoid penalty. “We are conducting wide-spread campaigns and going door-to-door reminding people to pay tax on time so that they are not penalised,” a senior official said. To increase property tax collections and ensure that at least the principal amount is cleared along with 10% interest, the civic body has also started OTS (one time settlement) scheme, which offers a 90% rebate on arrears accumulated interest, if the arrears are cleared by the property owners at one go. “I request the citizens to avail OTS, which will be closed on March 31, and also pay the current year tax dues,” said DS Lokesh Kumar, GHMC Commissioner. In the fiscal year 2019-20, the GHMC had managed to collect a total of Rs 1,472 crore in property tax.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ghmc-is-over-rs-350cr-short-of-rs-1900cr-property-tax-collection-target-this-fiscal/articleshow/81749554.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Second wave of new Covid cases in Bengal may peak in May-June||KOLKATA: The sharp spike in new Covid cases in Bengal over the last one week could lead to a ‘peak’ in late-May, around a month after state elections end, fear experts. With safety norms being widely violated at poll gatherings and festivals, the worst phase could be hastened and even prolonged, resulting in more casualties, they warned. On Monday, Bengal recorded 639 new cases, including 225 in Kolkata. While the mutated strains were less fatal, they have a much higher infectivity, pointed out CMRI Hospital director of pulmonology Raja Dhar. “Viruses tend to mutate favourably or turn less virulent to survive, which also increases their transmission rate. It is evident from the sharp rise in cases across the country, including in Bengal. With safety norms having been relaxed at election rallies and festivals, the spike will get even sharper. At this rate, we are heading for an explosion in cases a month after the elections,” said Dhar. Read AlsoExplained in 10 charts: How India's second Covid wave is more severe, different than firstThe second wave of coronavirus in India is spreading rapidly and is expected to get worse. The recent surge in cases is happening at a pace more rapid than seen during the first wave of the virus. The number of cases is likely to rise further in the wake of relaxed restrictions, festive season andPositivity rate, that had dropped to less than 2% at Peerless Hospital, has gone up to around 6% now. It will rise further, predicted Peerless microbiologist Bhaskar Narayan Choudhury. “We are heading back to the spiral that we had seen last October. This time, it is set to happen much quicker due to the mutated strains that are more transmissible. But the positive side is that since now we will have a larger population with a mild infection, herd immunity will develop faster,” said Choudhury. He added that the election period will be crucial in deciding the pace of transmission. “Depending on whether we can take precautionary measures and delay transmission, we may reach a peak a month and half to two months after Maharashtra reaches its peak. This is likely between end-May and mid-June,” said Choudhury. He, however, added that cases will drop faster, too, since they will be mild. Waiting for herd immunity to act as a shield against Covid could be disastrous, argued Dhar. “Even if we assume that the new strains are less fatal and if less than 1% die due to herd immunity, we will still be losing around 40 lakh people. Stepping up vaccination and adopting precautionary measures are a far better option if we have to save lives,” said Dhar. Times ViewMuch of what the government and the medical community have said regarding safe practices has been ignored. Law-enforcement agencies should look at cracking the whip.Even though the second wave is likely to see milder infections and lower mortality, it’s no reason to ignore safety precautions, said Belle Vue Clinic internal medicine consultant Rahul Jain. “It’s shocking to see that people are joining parties and taking part in festivities without masks. The vaccine may have made us complacent but we are, in fact, now at a stage where we should exercise the maximum possible caution. Sadly, we are doing the reverse, which is evident from the spiraling cases,” Jain said. Even after cases reach a peak in Bengal during June-July, Covid will persist, predicted Choudhury. “We will see cases climbing down but the pandemic will not be over,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/second-wave-of-new-covid-cases-in-bengal-may-peak-in-may-june/articleshow/81748961.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Kolkata||Ramp up inoculation, spread awareness in catchment areas, state tells hospitals||Kolkata: Hospitals in Kolkata have been asked to step up vaccination and launch an initiative to ensure that more are made aware of the inoculation drive and the fact that it is safe and the most effective way to ward off Covid. At a meeting convened on Monday by Joly Chaudhuri, joint secretary of the urban development department, it was also mentioned that the government will soon share a prototype of how it wants vaccination to be stepped up even though hospitals were free to devise their own ways. On April 1, hospitals across the state will start vaccinating those above 45 years. Several private and government hospitals took part in the meeting, along with representatives from nursing homes and clinics. An awareness campaign across offices, housing complexes and individual households has been suggested in their ‘catchment areas’ to make people aware of vaccination. Hospitals were also asked to distribute leaflets and put up banners across their premises. While the leaflets will be in three languages — Hindi, English and Bengali — recipients will also be told that though they were eligible for the second shot after four weeks, a gap of six-eight weeks between the two doses was ideal. Some hospitals said they were ready to ramp up the number of vaccines. “As a part of the major takeaway from today's meeting, our endeavour will be to ramp up our vaccination numbers by ensuring a minimum of 600-700 inoculations a day, other than healthcare workers. We will plan active promotion of the vaccination programme across the city and suburbs to increase awareness among citizens and eventually increase the number of recipients,” said RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) zonal head R Venkatesh. AMRI Hospitals has already decided to scale up the number of vaccinations to 1,500 a day from the present 1000. “Since the 45-plus group will be joining in from Thursday, there will be a rush and we need to inoculate more. We are ready to do it. As far as awareness is concerned, we have launched a campaign already in areas from where we receive patients. We have tied up with the leading social clubs across Kolkata and made arrangements to register senior citizens there. They are being given an appointment. We will now step up the campaign,” said AMRI CEO Rupak Barua. Those who have received their first jab must be individually informed about the time gap for the second shot, it was advised at the meeting. “We have been asked to send messages or call up those who have got the first dose that it was best to take the final dose after a gap of six-eight weeks. We will start doing it,” said a hospital chief. From April 1, those born on or before January 1, 1977, will be eligible for the vaccine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ramp-up-inoculation-spread-awareness-in-catchment-areas-state-tells-hospitals/articleshow/81748975.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

With Section 144 imposed across the state, policemen were on their toes througout the day, dissuading people from crowding. “We wanted to have a friendly festival celebration and at the same time make people realise that the coronovirus threat is real. With an increase in the number of cases related to the virus, we decided to sanitise and sensitise people about Covid-19,” Vasco police inspector Nilesh Rane told TOI. The Vasco police team consisting of a majority of constables went around the town, meeting vegetable and fruit vendors, fast food operators, etc, and spoke to people. “Instead of colourful water, we sprayed sanitisers on people's hands, and in place of gulal, we placed masks on people's faces,” Rane said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/at-vasco-holi-with-a-difference/articleshow/81750525.cms||Ruvina Khan
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad engineering college granted patent for its new signalling system to curb accidents||HYDERABAD: Hyderabad-based VNR Vignana Jyothi Institute of Engineering and Technology (VNRVJIET) has been granted a patent for its new signalling system to reduce the number of accidents. The new signalling system-- Intelligent and Intuitive Signalling System (IISS) provides an option to indicate when the vehicle is going forward straight, taking a U-turn, changing lanes, or overtaking from the right or the left. It can also be used to alert when braking suddenly or parking. “The new signals can be indicated by the driver from an additional panel that fits on the dashboard of any existing car. A display unit is conspicuously inserted at the top of the rear windshield of the cars for other vehicles to see,” said G Ramesh Chandra, head, Research & Consultancy Centre, VNRVJIET and professor in the computer science engineering department. The faculty, who invented the new system, said that the device operates wirelessly, is affordable, easy to install and service, and can be fit in any car. Commercialisation of the system might happen soon, they added. The lack of such signalling is believed to be the source of confusion for a vehicle behind another, thus leading to probable accidents. They pointed out that every year over 1.3 lakh die due to road accidents in India and over 15 lakh people get injured and added that lack of such signalling system is believed to be the source of confusion for a vehicle behind, thus leading to probable accidents. “Except for the sudden break, the user has to manually press buttons to indicate the direction in which he/she is planning to take,” said V Naveen Kumar, assistant professor, Electronics & Communication Engineering department. He said that there will be eight buttons on the panel which can be used to alert other vehicles on road. “Initially, it might be a little complicated, but once the user gets used to it the new system will reduce confusion on road and prevent accidents,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/city-engg-college-granted-patent-for-its-new-signalling-system-to-curb-accidents/articleshow/81749575.cms||Nirupa Vatyam
---||Kolkata||Bonding in the time of pandemic: Revival of para culture the biggest takeaway of Cov yr||Kolkata: The unprecedented challenges that the lockdown posed led many people to discover their neighbours and even inculcate a para culture that did not exist before. In multiple localities in south Kolkata, Salt Lake and New Town, containment zone warrior groups that had formed during lockdown are still active and have only increased their areas of interest. While elderlies living alone have benefited most from the change, residents of all ages also got to know each other better because of the prolonged stay in a controlled environment for a long time. “The pandemic led to new bonds of friendship being created. From chit-chatting from their balconies to providing essential items to the sick and needy while practising self-isolation and social distancing, neighbours had become friends during the lockdown. Now that a year has passed, the bonding has remained and no matter who is ill or in need of something, the entire block now comes forward to help at the drop of a text message,” said Basab Aich of Salt Lake BE Block resident association. When Covid-19 had just come to Kolkata, questions were raised about the upkeep of elderlies and sick living alone in places like Salt Lake and New Town, where people were often blamed to remain confined to their homes even during neighbour’s distress. But overnight, social welfare teams and groups were formed and now even though their original purpose (to deliver essentials to Covid patients under isolation) is over, the groups continue to socialise and extend a helping hand to the ones in need. “We had initially started the group to reach out to the needy and feed the poor and helpless. But now that the concept of lockdown has been eased, the group has started embracing larger issues like stubble burning, visual pollution, vaccination, life certificate registration process, group fitness activities and even promoting sporting activities,” said Ankur Roy Chowdhury, a resident of New Town and one of the founding members of New Town Forum and News. Complex residents – especially elderlies — have benefited a lot from these groups that continue to be rich in discussions and solutions. “Once a Covid distress chatbox, the WhatsApp group has become a residents’ forum now where everyone can voice their opinion and seek help,” said Ashok Baid, a resident of Silver Spring Housing Complex.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bonding-in-the-time-of-pandemic-revival-of-para-culture-the-biggest-takeaway-of-cov-yr/articleshow/81748977.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

According to the officials, the shops were running without any permission from the government and had no fire safety measures. Cherlapally station fire officer V Shekar Reddy said they received a call at 11.38 pm on Sunday night. “We reached the spot within eight minutes, but the impact was such that it took us about four hours to put off the fire using three fire tenders. There were no casualties, but all the four shops were completely destroyed.” The cause of the fire is being probed, he said. Fire officials could not identify the exact cause of the fire but said that the fire had spread rapidly from all four sides of the shops which is very unlikely in case of a short circuit. “This could have happened due to short circuit but looking at the way it spread from all the directions, it has to be investigated if someone did it on purpose,” an official told TOI. A case is being registered at Kushaiguda police station for further investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/4-shops-gutted-in-major-fire-had-no-safety-measures-govt-nod/articleshow/81749569.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||Lockdown did Hyderabad good, increased ozone layer 115%||HYDERABAD: Researchers from the city-based Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (IICT) found that the ozone (O3) concentration increased from 26 ppb (parts per billion) during pre-lockdown period to 56.4 ppb during the lockdown, resulting in a 115% increase in the ozone gas over Hyderabad. The study revealed that the concentration of nitrogen dioxide, nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide came down during the lockdown by 33.7%, 53.8% and 27.25% respectively, as the Covid-19 lockdown and subsequent restrictions, helped Hyderabad reduce the atmospheric pollutants considerably. Researchers carried out a comparative study on the pollutant concentrations during the pre-lockdown (February 1 to March 23, 2020) and lockdown period (March 24 to April 30, 2020) to those of the pollutants in the previous years (2018 and 2019). Carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and ozone were monitored along with meteorological parameters like temperature, relative humidity and solar radiation over Hyderabad to arrive at the results. “Covid-19 lockdown improved the air quality by the reduction in air pollutants leading to increased ozone concentration,” the study said. Besides IICT, the research team is drawn from the Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad. The research study by Sarat Kumar Allu, Aparna Reddy, Shailaja Srinivasan, Rama Krishna Maddala and Gangagni Rao Anupoju was published in the latest issue of science journal, ‘Environment Processes’. According to the study, during the lockdown the concentrations of carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide and nitrogen oxide showed significant declining trends. “Carbon monoxide has shown a maximum concentration of 349.68 ppb by volume during the pre-lockdown period, which decreased to a minimum of 192.5 ppb during the lockdown period. This can be attributed to less movement of light motor vehicles, motorcycles and heavy-duty vehicles. It can be observed that the carbon monoxide concentration was at peak at 11 am in the day in all three months,” the study stated. The researchers noted that nitrogen oxide concentration showed a lower concentration of 3.1 ppb during the pre-lockdown period, which continued till first week of April 2020. In the case of nitrogen dioxide, the concentrations were 25.6 ppb during pre-lockdown and 6.3 ppb during lockdown period. The study found that the concentration of ozone marginally decreased from February 25 to March 15 (19.5 ppb to 17.5 ppb) and then increased by over 50% by attaining a maximum of 48.4 ppb during the lockdown period. “This increase in ozone concentration was primarily due to the downtrend in concentrations of nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxides, photochemical titration reaction of nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds, and methane with meteorological conditions,” the researchers said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/lockdown-did-hyd-good-increased-ozone-layer-115/articleshow/81750526.cms||Syed Akbar
---||Pune||Hoteliers say another shutdown will lead to closure of 4k restos||Pune: Over 4,000 restaurants in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad and many from Maharashtra might close down for good if another lockdown is imposed, hospitality industry representatives told TOI on Monday. Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad roughly have 8,200 restaurants, while the number is around 1 lakh in Maharashtra. During the pandemic, around 300 restaurants in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad have closed down following failures to recover the economic losses caused by the numerous restrictions. Ganesh Shetty, president of the Pune Restaurants and Hoteliers Association (PRAHA), told TOI that a day of the 8pm closing deadline on Sunday resulted in close to Rs15 crore loss for restaurants in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad. “The 8pm deadline is already a death knell for the restaurants as 80% of business happens in the evening. A lot of restaurants are contemplating closure as taking away evening business hours means that we cannot recover the costs, including overheads. The Covid mortality rate is currently lower than last year’s peak infection period. The disease is now showing signs of becoming endemic, with many asymptomatic cases. A lockdown in such a scenario is not the answer.” Sherry Bhatia, president of the Hotel and Restaurant Association of Western India (HRAWI) told TOI, “Already restaurants in parts of Marathwada region, where several restrictions have been announced recently, are fearing huge financial losses. The losses are putting a lot of burden on the industry.” In several areas on Sunday, police started cracking down on restaurants, preventing some eateries in Kothrud, Tilak Road, Camp, Karve road from doing parcel services after 8 pm. “The latest state and civic body orders had allowed parcel services beyond 8 pm. However, the police came to our restaurant in Kothrud and began telling us to close the entire facility, including the kitchen at 8:30pm. Orders from the top are not reaching those on field,” a restaurateur from Kothrud said. “We have now started vaccinations of a chunk of population, even when over 90% cases are asymptomatic. A year into the pandemic, the health machinery is now more geared up to tackle Covid cases. That is why a lockdown or more restrictions are not needed,” PRAHA vice-president Vikram Shetty said. Another restaurateur said, “ Another lockdown will be disastrous for us, as we still have not recovered losses from the initial lockdown.” Restaurants and lounges are currently trying to keep losses at bay by increasing operation hours to full day till 8 pm instead of closing from 3:30pm till 7pm, as was the norm before the recent restrictions were imposed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/hoteliers-say-another-shutdown-will-lead-to-closure-of-4k-restos/articleshow/81749580.cms||Neha Madaan

A murder case was slapped on the accused, S Darshan (29), who was sent to judicial remand. Police said Darshan assaulted his wife Soundarya (25) and strangled her to death with a towel. Immediately after committing the crime, Darshan went to Osmania University police station and surrendered himself. “Darshan confessed to killing his wife. The accused often quarrels with his wife after consuming alcohol. This has been going on for a long time.

---||Mumbai||IPS officer claims ex-CP asked him to ‘close probe’ in Mumbai||Mumbai: IPS officer Sanjay Pandey, who was assigned the probe by the state government against another IPS officer over a series of allegations, has in a letter accused former commissioner of police Param Bir Singh of threatening the complainant to withdraw the complaint. Pandey, in a letter dated December 23 last, has also mentioned that Singh himself wrote to him asking to close the inquiry. Pandey, the seniormost police officer in the state, was recently transferred to the post of Director General (DG) of the Maharashtra State Security Corporation (MSSC). He has written to the Maharashtra government for ignoring him for the post of state director general of police, the top cop in the state. Retired assistant commissioner of police Rajendra Trivedi had complained about additional director general Deven Bharti’s alleged links with a few people of questionable background. Singh and Bharti did not respond to messages seeking their comment. The Aam Admi Party on Monday brought the matter up in the public domain. Pandey in his letter also mentioned about an audio clip which contained Singh’s conversation with Trivedi, where the latter was asked to withdraw the complaint after writing a letter to the state government. “From the audio clip, it is clear that Param Bir Singh is pressurising the complainant to withdraw the complaint. He is also using names of government functionaries with whom he can get this closed and also threatens the complainant with his contacts with the government.” In the audio clip, Singh also claimed that Pandey had no power to inquire into the case of a senior IPS officer on the direction of the home minister. Singh is heard saying in the clip that he can ensure closure of the inquiry by approaching the home minister directly, but he doesn’t want to go “top level” and instead wants Trivedi to withdraw the complaint by writing a letter to the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/ips-officer-claims-ex-cp-asked-him-to-close-probe-in-mumbai/articleshow/81750553.cms||Vijay V Singh
---||Hyderabad||SCB poll aspirants gear up for Cantonment board elections||SECUNDERABAD: Aspirants in three Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB) civilian wards reserved for women and one civilian ward for Scheduled Caste (SC) are gearing up to contest in the ensuing Cantonment board elections, likely to be held in another few months. A couple of days ago, the Ministry of Defence (MoD), had notified reservations to the four wards (II, V and VI -women & VIII-SC) out of the eight wards in the Cantonment board. At least three to five aspirants in the remaining four wards (I, III IV and VII) fall under general category, and they are also gearing up to contest the elections. Former ward members, those who contested in the previous Cantonment board polls, social workers and professionals are expected to try their luck in the ensuing polls. Apart from this, those backed by certain political parties including the TRS, BJP, Congress, Left parties and independents will also contest. However, for the ruling TRS and the opposition parties BJP and Congress, finalising the names of the candidates for the polls could be a tough task. For instance, the TRS will have to select candidates from a huge list of aspirants in all eight wards. Though three to four months are remaining for the election notification to be issued, all eyes are on appointment of a civilian nominated post. The MoD is likely to announce the name in the first week of April. A total of four former SCB vice-presidents are in the race for the post.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/scb-poll-aspirants-gear-up-for-cantt-board-elections/articleshow/81749603.cms||Sunil Mungara
---||Pune||Payment delays to hospitals led to ‘artificial bed crunch’||As a result, most private hospitals in Pune had scores of non-Covid patients admitted when cases started rising again. “The PMC wants us to start reserving beds again for Covid patients. But where should we send the non-Covid patients who are already occupying beds? We have stopped non-Covid admissions. As for payment of bills, we have received only 50% of what we are owed so far,” said Bomi Bhote, president of the Association of Hospitals in Pune. The dues arise from the 80:20 rule the state had imposed on private hospitals. Facilities were told to reserve 80% of their beds for Covid patients. The reserved beds also came with caps on treatment fees, with hospitals promised reimbursements from local governments. Rubal Agarwal, additional commissioner of the PMC said, “We have issued an order of 80:20 bed reservation across 23 private hospitals in Pune civic limits. These 23 facilities will have to make sure 80% of their beds are available for Covid treatment only.” Jitendra Oswal, deputy medical director, Bharati hospital said, “After Covid cases started dropping mid-September, private hospitals in Pune slowly started converting Covid beds into non-Covid beds for pending elective surgeries and other illnesses. When cases started rising again in March this year, most hospitals’ beds were full with non-Covid patients. So there has been a delay in reserving more beds for Covid patients.” Oswal added, “Delays in payments of Covid patients’ bills and lack of clarity on who will settle these bills surely are reasons why private hospitals are going slow on bringing more beds under Covid care.” Medical expert H K Sale, of Noble hospital, said, “The state government has capped Covid treatment charges. But the state and PMC should release payments for these bills every month so that we can pay our staff on time. How can people work without pay? This is the time for everyone to help each other.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/payment-delays-to-hospitals-led-to-artificial-bed-crunch/articleshow/81749615.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Assets owned before offence not proceeds of crime: AP HC||HYDERABAD: In a significant ruling, Justice R Raghunandan Rao of the AP high court has held that the Enforcement Directorate (ED) cannot call assets acquired by an accused as proceeds of crime if they were bought before the commission of such an offence. The judge gave this ruling and ordered the release of the attached assets of an accused, which were bought before the commission of the alleged offence, on March 20. The judge pronounced this order after hearing Kumar Pappu Singh, a resident of Erramanzil Colony in Hyderabad, and some of his companies that challenged the ED attachment. In March 2018, the CBI had registered an FIR against Pappu Singh and his companies for allegedly defrauding IDBI Bank’s Palangi branch in West Godavari district to an extent of Rs 75 crore. CBI alleged that he availed kisan credit card (KCC) loans in the names of various borrowers and re-routed all the money into his savings account before siphoning of the same. The bank gave KCC loans to 101 borrowers. Bank officials, who processed the loan papers, too were at fault because the loans were sanctioned and disbursed without obtaining proper loan documents and conducting pre-sanction and post-sanction inspections. Worse still, they did not even bother to verify the end-user of the loan. These loan amounts were disbursed to savings accounts of the beneficiaries, from where the money was transferred to the accounts of Pappu Singh, who later misused it. CBI charged Papu Singh with cheating the bank. Since cheating is a scheduled offence that attracts the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), ED later entered the scene and unearthed the siphoned money trail. According to the ED, all money made through a crime is crime money or proceeds of crime. It can attach such money or equivalent worth of assets bought with such money. ED had identified that Pappu Singh diverted 70 crore to various other businesses. It identified some of his current properties and had attached them in December 2019. They were two sets of properties, one set was acquired prior to September 2010 and the other after. The second set was acquired with proceeds of crime, while the former set of properties have got nothing to do with the crime or its proceeds. Most of the proceeds of crime were exhausted owing to losses suffered by Pappu Singh in aquaculture. ED opposed any relief for Pappu Singh on the ground that he has an alternative remedy under PMLA wherein he could approach the adjudicating authority if he has any objection. Petitioner’s counsel Vimal Varma Vasireddy brought to the notice of the Hyderabad high court judgment in Satyam Computers case that said that mere existence of an alternative remedy was no bar for a party to approach a high court. The judge agreed with him and brushed aside ED’s objection on the issue of maintainability of the case before a high court. Coming to the issue of attachment, ED contended that it had attached the old assets of the accused because he exhausted all the fraud money in pisciculture and suffered huge losses there. The judge did not agree with this interpretation and said that even the legislature did not intend this way while amending the Act in 2019 and said that ED might have a case for attaching equal worth of assets if the accused diverted the money to foreign shores. In the instant case, however, the accused had lost the money. Hence, the attachment of his pre-2010 assets cannot be justified, Justice Raghunandan said in his order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/assets-owned-before-offence-not-proceeds-of-crime-ap-hc/articleshow/81750537.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Providing clean water to furry friends||HYDERABAD: About four years ago, while taking a walk in the neighbourhood, Lakshman Molleti’s eyes caught a heart-rending image. It was of a mother dog and her pups drinking water from a dirty puddle. Disturbed by it, he soon started keeping a bowl of clean water for dogs in his area. Over the next few days, the software engineer’s small gesture had started attracting not just dogs but other animals too. Inspired by it, Lakshman decided to take on a bigger project — of distributing water bowls to people who are interested in helping animals that struggle to find clean drinking water in the city. “Many animals and birds do not find a source of clean drinking water, and this eventually leads to various health challenges such as dehydration, skin infections, fever and viral infections and even death. After what I experienced, I had this urge to not only help more and more animals but also educate people about the importance of providing clean water,” said Lakshman. It is this aim — to reach a larger audience — that led the software engineer to start the Animals Water Bowl Project. The objective is to ensure that every stray animal in the city has access to clean drinking water round-the-clock, throughout the year. “I distribute water bowls to people who are truly interested in it. Just placing the water bowls in front of our apartment complexes and in the neighbourhood will not fulfil the purpose. One needs to refill these bowls every day and clean them once a week,” said Lakshman. Apart from cleaning and monitoring the water bowl, one of the rules people must agree to when they request for a water bowl is that they must share pictures and videos of it at least every 15 days. “This will tell us if the water bowls that we are distributing are really helping the animals or not,” he said. The sturdy cement bowls with a smooth finish and ‘Water for Animals’ painted on them has a capacity of six litres and weighs about 10 kg each. Lakshman has been dipping into his savings since 2017 when he started the distribution programme in Hyderabad and has now expanded it to Pune, Thane and Visakhapatnam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/providing-clean-water-to-furry-friends/articleshow/81749618.cms||Moulika.KV
---||Hyderabad||In HCA infighting, cricket is the loser||HYDERABAD: The ruckus at the Hyderabad Cricket Association (HCA) annual general meeting (AGM) on Sunday, when charges and counters between two former Indian Test players flew thick and fast has caused much heartburn in the fraternity. “What has happened yesterday was the finishing touch to what has been done by these three or four office-bearers in the last 30 years. Unfortunately, in the last one-and-half-years, it has gone beyond control because the strength and composition of the Apex Council is so small that there is no accountability,” said former HCA secretary PR Man Singh. The war of words between president Mohd Azharuddin and others led by former presidents Arshad Ayub and N Shivlal Yadav over the appointment of the Ombudsman is just the tip of the iceberg. The HCA has been plagued with several issues over the years, namely lack of transparency in financial and selection matters. In September 2019, the Azharuddin-led panel, backed by both Ayub and Yadav, had swept the elections but the bonhomie didn’t last. Lack of coordination among the Apex Council members soon surfaced. Azharuddin, who feels that he has been elected to clean up the system but is unable to carry his team of office-bearers with him, took up the appointment of the Ombudsman in late 2019. The matter was discussed in the Apex Council and secretary R Vijayanand had also written to Justice Verma for his consent. In June last year, the Apex Council had decided to appoint Justice Verma, subject to ratification at the AGM. Things went smoothly till some members complained to Justice Verma about the issue of multiple clubs. After going through the issue, Justice Verma sent notices to two office-bearers. Thereafter members started a campaign to ensure Verma’s appointment was not ratified at the AGM. There are other issues which need urgent attention. One of them is the selection of state teams. This issue was highlighted by former captain Ambati Rayudu in a tweet, which resulted in a war of words between him and Azharuddin. Rayudu left Hyderabad and played for Andhra this season. The selection of the team for Vijay Hazare tournament drew a lot of flak too. “At least after yesterday’s episode, if the representatives who attended the meeting and the people who matter don’t open their eyes, even God will not be able to help HCA or Hyderabad cricket,” added Man Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/in-hca-infighting-cricket-is-the-loser/articleshow/81749616.cms||Solomon S Kumar
---||Mumbai||Gateway, Marine Drive, Bandstand, public spaces emptied out by 8pm||MUMBAI: On Sunday, the first day of the state government order that more than five people will not be allowed in any public place, including gardens and beaches, from 8pm to 7am the following day, police were seen at prominent spots in the city, asking people to disperse. The state has issued the prohibitory order under Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC)’s Section 144. Popular tourist spots such as Gateway of India, Bandra Bandstand, Joggers’ Park and Marine Drive wore a deserted look after 8pm. Many said on Marine Drive, police personnel were seen ensuring there was no crowding.  Mahendra Hemdev, a local resident who was on his regular evening walk, said the promenade always attracts large crowds on weekends. “Today, they were asked to leave a little before 8pm itself. By 8pm, the entire promenade was empty,” said Hemdev. By contrast, locals said Juhu beach was not cleared by 8pm on Sunday. “It certainly was not vacated. On Monday, though, cops were stationed on the beach on account of Holi. Citizens, I feel, should ensure they act in a way that it does not lead to the spread of the virus. Putting on your face masks is essential in the current situation,” said Zahida Banatwala of Juhu Citizens’ Welfare Group. At Bandra’s Bandstand and Carter Road, the promenades were cleared. Local corporator Asif Zakeria said he saw police vans moving about, asking people to disperse. “The siren was continuously ringing to make citizens aware they cannot gather in large numbers. On Monday morning, too, before 7am, citizens were not being allowed to take their morning walks or jog. At Joggers’ Park, which witnesses a high footfall, visitors were asked to move out from 7.30pm itself on Sunday,” said Zakeria. The state has announced a ban on all gatherings, including political and religious. It has also directed restaurants, cinema halls, malls and auditoriums to remain shut after 8pm. — Richa Pinto||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/gateway-marine-drive-bandstand-public-spaces-emptied-out-by-8pm/articleshow/81748456.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Business||Cyient expects business normalcy by mid 2021||After Covid-19 sent his company’s largest business vertical – aerospace and defence -- crashing, BVR Mohan Reddy, executive chairman, Cyient Ltd, has managed to steer his company out of the turbulence by changing gears and riding the digital transformation wave. He is now hopeful of business cruising back to normalcy by mid 2021, he tells Swati Bharadwaj. What were the key challenges posed by Covid-19? On the supply side, when the lockdown was announced, we had to ship out thousands of laptops. But in the first 10 days post lockdown we managed to get 95% of our employees functional. On the demand side, the business itself was impacted as customers went into shutdown. One of our largest verticals -- aerospace and defence – took a big hit. Did the pandemic impact hiring? Did you have to downsize? Some verticals where we had some serious de-growth, we had to reskill people into new domains or even downsize. For instance, aerospace and defence business will take another 2-3 years to recover. We took a humanitarian approach but you can’t have people on the bench so we let go of some people and the severance was fairly generous. So, there was a marginal impact in terms of downsizing as a consequence. We are also hiring in areas where we require new skills but our focus is on ensuring we have existing people doing new tasks as opposed to hiring new people for new tasks. By when do you expect a recovery? There are still challenges in terms of predicting demand but we believe by end of Q4 of 2020-21 or Q1 of 2021-22, business will come back to normalcy. We postponed increments for the current financial year from April but a large portion of our employees got salary increases from October 1. There was also a freeze on variable salary as part of cost control measures but probably starting from January 2021 we will also release it. We have seen fairly stable business in transportation also green shoots from communications, which has overtaken aerospace to become our largest vertical now. What strategies did you adopt to tackle the pandemic impact? Digital has become the new normal and our ability to engage existing customers with digital services has bene helping us. Today when you go to them with a new proposition, the lead time involved in getting order closure is becoming much faster. We are also seeing some very good results from remote selling. What positive changes has the pandemic ushered in? Covid-19 has busted the myth that WFH is not possible and also about information security and cyber security. WFH will become the new norm but it will be a hybrid model. We expect that 30-40% of the time people will WFH, due to which 30-40% space can become redundant. We have begun releasing space in some offices in Hyderabad and will start reducing spaces at offices globally. Transportation costs will come down as will commute times. What are the new trends in hiring? Remote hiring is the new norm and we also hired two high level executives remotely. Campus hiring will slowly become a thing of the past. The new normal will be more of virtual hiring whether it is interviews, onboarding, joining information. Certainly, automation will go a long way. Any key lessons learnt from the pandemic? Employee and customer engagement is very important as these will drive you towards more trust, which will bring better business and better outcome to the business.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/cyient-expects-business-normalcy-by-mid-2021/articleshow/81767102.cms||Swati Bharadwaj
---||Delhi||Drives to prod people to take Covid shots in Delhi||NEW DELHI: With those above 45 years set to take the Covid-19 vaccines from Thursday, district authorities are scaling up the vaccination sites. They are also coming up with new plans to create awareness among the beneficiaries. For the past few days, a group of youngsters in crimson kurtas with a dafli (tambourine) in hand has been travelling through the narrow lanes of some of the most congested residential areas of the Central district to spread awareness about the vaccination process through nukkad nataks (street plays). The awareness strategy, however, differs from one area to another. While nukkad natak would be extremely eye-catching in a thickly populated area, it might not find enough audience in a sprawling, upscale residential colony. “Our strategy is awareness through LED screens and two LEDs — one in Greater Kailash-II M Block and another in Lajpat Nagar— have already come up. The LEDs are showing IEC (information, education and communication) graphics continuously,” said Vishwendra, district magistrate (South East). He said, while the district had about 18 government vaccine centres, six more have been added and four more would come up by next Saturday. The Central district will have 28 government vaccination centres, and while currently the percentage of vaccination is 69%, the administration is aiming for 100% soon. A South district official said, while 7,400 vaccinations were being carried out every day, the number would go up to 9,000 soon with inoculation of those above 45 years beginning from Thursday. “From Wednesday, we are planning to target offices, banks, market places, commercial complexes, etc., as a lot of people older than 45 years come to such locations for work,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/drives-to-prod-people-to-take-covid-shots/articleshow/81768617.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Pune||Remdesivir need not wait for severe Covid signs: Docs||Pune: A year into the Covid pandemic, doctors in Pune are now relying more on a patient's clinical picture than just general guidelines before administering the anti-viral remdesivir. Doctors said instead of waiting for patients to have low blood oxygen saturation or hypoxia, they are also now considering early-stage and immediate factors such as persistent fever, cough, pre-existing conditions and age for administering the intravenous drug. "As critical care specialists, our aim is to treat Covid patients early to avoid complications. So more than simply relying on guidelines, we are now thoroughly assessing patients' clinical picture and giving equal importance to other factors, including persistent fever, cough, comorbidities and age," said Kapil Borawake, a critical care expert from Sahyadri hospital. Ruby Hall Clinic's chief intensivist Kapil Zirpe said, "Hypoxia or low blood oxygen saturation below 92% definitely warrants use of remdesivir. But there are other scenarios too in which the patient maintains oxygen saturation over 94%, but has patches on lungs or high-grade fever or cough in addition to lung involvement. A patient's underlying medical condition and age may also necessitate early use of the drug." The logic is that once hypoxia sets in, the physiology of the patient changes and can progress to need ventilation. "So, select the right patient and initiate treatment early in course of the disease," said Sanjeevan hospital's chief intensivist Subhal Dixit. Hypoxia (oxygen deficiency) in Covid occurs when a significant part of the lung is involved. "First, we see it during activity and later even during rest. Therefore, the universal guideline to look at oxygen percentage through an oximeter is emphasized," Dixit said. He added, "However, many patients only rely on assessing the blood oxygen saturation level at rest and forget to measure it before and after the six-minute walk test (SMWT). Several patients show good oxygen saturation at rest but their levels drop significantly after the SMWT, which shows an inducible hypoxic state." Remdesivir was early on used to treat patients with severe Covid. Later, it was used for moderate illness as well. Steroids are now a standard part of the treatment routine, given along with the drug. Experts said remdesivir kills the virus, cuts viral load and steroids douse the fire initiated by the pathogen. "Therefore it is logical to extend the use of remdesivir early to prevent inflammation. The drug is now being used early: during minimal or no hypoxia, if the fever does not reduce or when the CT scan shows abnormalities or in people with significant comorbidities," said Dhruv Chaudhary, critical care expert and president of the Indian Society Of Critical Care Medicine (ISCCM).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/remdesivir-need-not-wait-for-severe-covid-signs-docs/articleshow/81749650.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Hyderabad||Ombudsman urgently needed in HCA: Azhar||The ombudsman has already been appointed by the apex council. The decision was taken and we also had got his consent. It was only a matter of ratifying it in the AGM but now they are saying that they have passed a resolution against the appointment. How can they pass a resolution without the president? It has to be done in the apex council which is chaired by the president. Without the knowledge of the president, the members cannot pass a resolution. That was the main issue and beyond it all else was smoothly done as we passed the accounts. I don’t know why they are against Verma. I have no idea at all. They don’t want him but for what reasons I am not sure. Appointment of the Ombudsman is part of the Lodha panel recommendations and is not my invention. The ombudsman should have been appointed a long time back but they didn’t do it. Every day, I keep getting so many letters about ownership of clubs. I am not the person to tackle it. That’s why we need an Ombudsman to solve all these problems. So, I took the initiative and discussed the matter with the others and did it. Whatever I have done thus far, I did by informing the Apex Council members. I haven’t done anything unilaterally. It is all written and recorded in the apex council minutes. Things can go smoothly if everyone does their job. Whatever I am doing is for the benefit of cricketers and the game. Everyone needs to rally around and fulfil their given responsibility. It’s all about teamwork. Then administration becomes easy if each one does their work properly. I don’t want to talk about the past as I was not there. I am aware of what all happened but I am not interested in blame game and mudslinging. I took charge only in September 2019 and almost a year has gone in fighting Covid-19. But we still managed to have some cricket. However, from the next season we will be able to start on time. We couldn’t have the AGM on time due to Covid restrictions. We cannot go against the government norms. Yesterday too we did our best given the restrictions laid down.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ombudsman-urgently-needed-in-hca-azhar/articleshow/81749648.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Budget schools demand financial aid from Telangana govt||HYDERABAD: After neighbouring Andhra Pradesh closed schools in the wake of a surge in Covid-19 cases, private budget schools from Telangana have decided not to pressure the government to reopen schools. The managements have called off relay hunger strikes, which they were supposed to start from Tuesday. They are now demanding that the state provide financial support to both managements and its teachers. “Keeping the current situation in mind, we have decided not to organise relay hunger strikes demanding reopening of schools. However, starting today we will be protesting during the morning hours for about two hours demanding the state to waive property tax, power, water, and other bills. This is the least the state can do for managements,” said Shekar Rao Y, president, Telangana Recognized School Managements Association (TRSMA). The managements said that they also want the state to pay Rs 7,000 per month for the lockdown period to every teacher working in private budget schools. They made it clear that they will not pass any student without examination and clearance of fee dues. “Hardly 10% to 15% students studying at budget schools have cleared fees to date. If a student fails to clear the fee and appear for examinations, we will be withholding their transfer certificates,” added Rao. Teachers, meanwhile, said that managements have not supported teachers in the last year and added that even now they are holding these protests as eyewash. “In the last one month, the managements have collected about 80% of the fee, but have not paid teachers who conducted physical classes for class 6 to class 10 students. Now, after parents started demanding a refund of the fee, they are behaving as if they care about teachers,” said Shabir Ali, president, Telangana Private Teachers Forum, adding that the state should ensure that managements pay pending salaries to their teachers. They said that instead of asking the state to support teachers, managements should pay Rs 10, 000 per month to each teacher for the lockdown period. If any school is on the verge of shutting down due to financial constraints, the state should come to its rescue, added teachers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/budget-schools-demand-financial-aid-from-govt/articleshow/81749641.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

Responding to the call, MNM propaganda secretary C K Kumaravel said Kamal would first want to debate with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman. “Later he could come to tukada leaders like Vanathi Srinivasan,” he said.Taking exception to the term, Vanathi said that she had come from a humble background, studied in a government school and pursued law amidst all odds. She entered public life to serve people and rose up the ranks the hard way, she said. “If a woman from a humble background grows up in politics, is this the way they disrespect her? How will a party that doesn’t respect women be able to protect them? Kamal Haasan should answer.”Later in the day, BJP national secretary C T Ravi said that TN needed the twin engine of AIADMK and BJP for a faster run. Releasing the party’s manifesto for Coimbatore South, Ravi slammed DMK president M K Stalin for the alleged false propaganda against BJP. “Stalin should clarify if he is a believer or non–believer. He only insults Hindu deities,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/vanathi-demands-explanation-from-kamal-on-tukada-jibe/articleshow/81749021.cms||---
---||Kochi||Crime branch files second case against ED officers||Thiruvananthapuram: The standoff between state government and enforcement directorate (ED) has intensified with the state crime branch registering another case against ED sleuths based on the complaint from the third accused in the gold smuggling case, Sandeep Nair. The case was registered on the basis of the petition filed by Nair’s advocate to state police chief Loknath Behera. Earlier, Nair had written a letter to the Ernakulam district sessions judge, in which he had said that ED sleuths were forcing him to depose against the chief minister and other ministers. After seeking a legal opinion in the matter, Alappuzha unit of the crime branch registered the second case. This case will be handed over to the special team from Thiruvananthapuram crime unit that is already probing the first case registered against ED officers. Earlier, crime branch had registered a case against ED officers, who are probing the gold smuggling case, based on the statements of two women civil police officers (CPOs). Woman CPO Siji Vijayan of Palarivattom police station and S Rejimol of Kadavanthra police station, who were allegedly on duty while ED officers interrogated Swapna Suresh, had stated before the probe team that ED officers were compelling Swapna to give a statement against the chief minister. Crime branch had charged the first case under IPC Sections 116, 120-B, 167, 192, 193 and 195-A for conspiracy, intimidation and forcing to give false statements against the chief minister. Crime branch had also conducted a preliminary inquiry before registering the first case, in which statements of 18 persons, including that of the key accused in the gold smuggling case Swapna, was recorded. Kerala had received legal advice from the director general of prosecutions that a case should be registered against ED sleuths who had interrogated Swapna in prison. Government had sought legal advice on the basis of the report of the investigation team that had probed the leak of an alleged voice clip of Swapna. The alleged voice clip by Swapna that was circulated online had led to a controversy then. In the voice clip, Swapna was heard saying that ED sleuths had offered to make her an approver if she gave a statement against the chief minister in the gold smuggling case.  She had also said that ED had not allowed her to go through her statements properly before signing it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/crime-branch-files-second-case-against-ed-officers/articleshow/81749022.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

It could be a sweep also as the people of Tamil Nadu want to remove the AIADMK government. They also don’t want the footprint of BJP in their soil,” Raja said.Stating that the BJP is not a political party, Raja said it is a political wing of the RSS and the saffron party is attempting to destroy the democracy in our country. The party wanted to divide people based on religion and language and implement the RSS ideology of one nation and one language, he added.When questioned about Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s remarks that he had participated in a satyagraha for the freedom of Bangladesh, Raja said Bangladesh was formed in 1971. “Where was the BJP in 1971?” he asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/assembly-election-results-will-decide-countrys-future-d-raja/articleshow/81749025.cms||---

---||Goa||Gaonkar, Falari in race for Bicholim town’s top post||BICHOLIM: Former chairperson Rajaram Gaonkar and Kundan Falari are frontrunners to head the Bicholim Municipal Council (BMC). Sources said that there is a strong possibility that Gaonkar, who was elected from ward 11, may stake claim for the top post as he has been BMC’s chairperson for the three consecutive terms, including the last term. However, some senior BJP leaders favour a change and are likely to support Kudan Falari as he has been elected by a highest margin of 392 votes from ward 13. He was also deputy chairperson during the last term. Also, Riaz Beg from ward 9 and Tanuja Gaonkar from ward 12 are in contention for the deputy chairperson’s post. Tanuja has been elected for the past four terms, while Beg was the deputy chairperson during the last term. Sources said that if Falari is made chairperson, then Tanuja, who is Rajaram’s wife, could be elected as deputy chairperson. The election for both the posts will be held on April 1. BJP boasts of nine councillors in the 14-member council. Moreover, the party’s strength has increased to 10 seats after one elected councillor from ward 5, Nilesh Tople, who won as an independent, extended his support to BJP. Out of the remaining four councillors, three of them belong to Naresh Sawal’s ‘Together for Bicholim’ panel while, one councillor is from the ‘Bicholim Vision Panel’ headed by the Shetye brothers. Nominations for both the posts will be accepted on March 31, deputy collector and BMC chief officer Deepak Vaigankar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gaonkar-falari-in-race-for-bicholim-towns-top-post/articleshow/81750555.cms||---
---||Pune||BJP to protest on the streets if lockdown is imposed, says Chandrakant Patil||PUNE: Sitting at home in Matoshree, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray does not understand the adverse impact of a lockdown on citizens. It is not the solution and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will oppose it by taking to the streets if it is imposed under the garb of controlling Covid-19 cases, BJP’s state unit chief Chandrakant Patil said on Monday. He was speaking to reporters after meeting Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta for a police chowkey in Happy Colony in Kothrud. “We will strongly oppose any move of the state government to impose a lockdown in the state because of the increasing number of Covid-19 cases,” Patil said. The state government has not given a single paise to compensate for the losses caused to the people during the lockdown, he said. “The chief minister should visit the lanes and bylanes in different parts of the state without his official convoy. Only then will he understand the problems people have faced during a lockdown,” Patil said. Life has been coming back to normal in the last few months, and a lockdown now will adversely affect the economy, he added. Patil said Covid-19’s spread can be halted by taking precautions. Use of masks and sanitisers, following social distancing should be made mandatory, and options like night curfew can be explored, he added. The contribution of the unorganized sector to the economy is huge and a lockdown will affect them the most. The state should declare a package of Rs 5,000 per head for them people to deal with the impact. Daily wagers, autorickshaw drivers, hawkers and domestic help would benefit from this assistance, Patil said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/bjp-to-protest-on-the-streets-if-lockdown-is-imposed-says-patil/articleshow/81749681.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Sunil Gavaskar chokes while remembering Jaisimha||HYDERABAD: Having completed 50 years in international cricket, first as a batsman and then as an erudite commentator, Sunil Gavaskar has seen it all. It is rare to see him get teary-eyed about the sport he loves so much and the sportsmen he has played with over the years. But the legendary batsman could not stop the tears while delivering the inaugural M L Jaisimha Lecture here on Monday. Gavaskar couldn’t help but get emotional as he recounted how he met his hero just before he passed away. “March 3 (Jaisimha’s birthday) is a very happy day for me and July 7 (when Jaisimha passed in 1999) the saddest day,” said an emotional Gavaskar. “I was so upset at the thought of seeing my hero in a bad shape that I didn’t want to see him. But my wife convinced me (to go meet him). I came and spent time with him. He was sedated and asleep. He actually looked the same, no change. He pressed my hand and it was time to leave,” he said trying hard to hold back tears. “But while I was still at the airport and about to take the flight back to Mumbai, I got the message that he had passed away.” Nobody can knot a tie like him or croon in a richer baritone, that an evening spent with Jaisimha is a life lesson, Gavaskar added. “People like him live forever. July 7 is also the birthday of one of India’s greatest player — MS Dhoni — a dasher like Jai.” Immaculately dressed, again like his hero, Gavaskar regaled the audience with tales of how he fell in love with a black and white picture of Jaisimha before India’s tour of England in 1959. The affection continued to grow with everything he did, including batting on all five days of a Test match in Kolkata in 1959-60. From there to seeing Jaisimha in the flesh at the Brabourne stadium where the Indian team trained ahead of their series against Ted Dexter’s England left a lasting impression on a young Gavaskar. “We were schoolkids following every move of our heroes. When one ball came towards us and we were trying to pick it up I still remember what Jai told us: Don’t worry boys, I’ll take it.’” In 1962, Gavaskar saw him a second time “and nine years later I was on the same team as my hero as we left for the West Indies. How many people get that opportunity? There were only two rooms we’d visit on tour, one of captain Ajit Wadekar and the second Jai. I noticed he used to apply Ponds cold cream. I never had the guts to ask him why, but I tried it once and after dropping all catches in practice that day, I decided against it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/gavaskar-chokes-while-remembering-jaisimha/articleshow/81750551.cms||JAC Gladson
---||Hyderabad||Azhar should take everyone along with him: Ayub||We are uncomfortable with Justice Deepak Verma as the Ombudsman. We just said instead of him you can put anyone of your choice. But four to five people were supporting him and Azhar was trying to push through with it. We refused to budge and said it should go by the majority. That is a democratic way of functioning and the bye-laws say the ombudsman has to be appointed by the general body and not the apex council. That’s the crux of the issue. I have no idea why Azhar is backing Deepak Verma. It is surprising for us as the majority of the house was not in his favour. We said that he could have a secret ballot to find out the majority. For some reason, he took it personally and I don’t know why. Anybody can be made the ombudsman and I have no issues with it but it should be done properly. What I feel is that being the president, he must take everyone together and show that things are going in the right direction. In my opinion, selection is getting affected. Selections should be without any bias and that is something which is not happening. When we picked up the Vijay Hazare team this season, the names of the top eight performers was missing. How do we justify that? You pick the performers first and then take the others. Why did we stop the academy? It was done during (MV) Sridhar’s time. When we started the academy there were so many good results. If you look at any other state, they all have academies and they prepare for the state matches much before the time. We need to do that and not select the team three to four days before the tournament. I think it is high time that we get our act together. I feel that the league is very important. The premier league should be of high quality with a limited number of teams. This season a lot of teams have been allowed to play in the premier league and I don’t agree to it. They should have been in the two-day league.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/azhar-should-take-everyone-along-with-him-ayub/articleshow/81749687.cms||Solomon S Kumar

But the civic body has not taken any action to address it. We made several representations to streamline waste management, also in vain,” he said.“Smart city officials had promised to share the model road project plan with us. Now, the road has shrunk at several places. This will lead to traffic congestion and shortage of parking space. Several illegal structures have come up on the road, making it congested. We have no idea what is going in our neighbourhood. We want parking and no-parking zones here,” Balagopal said. The residents also requested the candidates to check stray dog menace and provide a separate space for the Muthamil Mandram.Rana representatives submitted the memorandum to MNM chief Kamal Haasan, BJP’s Vanathi Srinivasan and Congress’s Mayura Jayakumar and requested them to take steps to resolve the issues if elected to power.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/residents-present-civic-wish-list-to-candidates/articleshow/81749023.cms||---

The letter was put out in the public space on Monday, the day after Doljatra, which was held ahead of time this year fearing a surge in Covid cases. The university has been in the eye of a storm for several months, with a section of the faculty and students protesting against measures the administration has taken with VC Bidyut Chakraborty at the helm. The faculty decided the impasse was leading nowhere and giving the university a bad name. “The level of discourse we have dropped to is not helping. It is maligning the sanctity of the glorious institution ...We urge everyone to join hands to create a better atmosphere for academic pursuit,” the letter said. The letter is being seen as an effort by the faculty to build bridges since teaching-learning and the general academic atmosphere has been severely affected. “We have agreed to hold out an olive branch of inclusivity...,” a signatory said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/v-b-faculty-extends-olive-branch-with-open-letter/articleshow/81749031.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

The five accused persons – Sandeep Nair, Muhammad Anwar, Musthafa, Abdul Aseez and Nandagopal – were present in court as part of proceedings under CrPC 306 in which the accused are granted pardon before making them witnesses in the case. Sandeep Nair was presented before the court from Poojappura Central prison where he is undergoing preventive detention under Cofeposa. The other four accused were not arrested in the case.

He is learnt to have stated that he volunteered to become an approver in the case, when he was asked whether he was becoming a witness due to any influence exerted by the agency. Similarly, the other accused persons also stated that they volunteered to become witnesses in the case. The court on Monday decided to issue an order on the proceedings on Tuesday. Interestingly, Nair – who volunteered to become an approver in the NIA case – has levelled allegations against enforcement directorate (ED) officers in a letter written to district principal sessions court that he was threatened to name chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan and other ministers in the gold smuggling case.

"Whatever I read about the AGM makes me very sad. Cricketers getting into all this is not in good taste," said former Hyderabad captain Kanwaljit Singh. Echoing similar sentiments, former India left-arm spinner SL Venkatapathi Raju said: "They should settle the issue amicably. Two hundred clubs have to work together. Most of the time, it’s only blame game." "Everything else but cricket is discussed," said Noel David. "We are at the bottom of the Ranji Trophy teams but we are busy with personal agendas." Former Hyderabad opener Vijay Mohan Raj said, "In our times, good players got into the A Division and there was selection for each team. You can see from the scores in the papers, people are scoring heavily – there seem to be lot of Don Bradmans in the league. Whatever is happening is really bad, but the decline started two decades ago." All of them agreed that revival of HCA academy and revamp of the league system needs urgent attention. “Revive the academy and all players should go to the state team only after being whetted at the academy. Also ensure that clubs getting money from HCA, do not charge the players," Raj added. "It is important to make sure that qualified people man and monitor the activities in the academy," Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/revive-academy-revamp-league-ex-players/articleshow/81749713.cms||Solomon S Kumar
---||Delhi||Finally, leave cars & care behind at Chandni Chowk||NEW DELHI: Come Thursday and Chandni Chowk will no longer be the chaotic place that Delhiites are familiar with. There will be no handcarts, e-rickshaws, commercial vehicles and cars sharing scarce space with pedestrians. The Public Works Department has met the March 31 redevelopment deadline and traffic-weary shoppers can now take a leisurely stroll down the greenery-fringed thoroughfare. Civic officials said that parking lots were being planned in the vicinity to allow people to leave their cars and care behind. Some of the amenities that have been newly provided include public toilets, benches for visitors, loading/unloading bays for vans ferrying stocks to the shops, CCTV monitoring and Delhi Police and traffic booths for security. There has also been an upgradation of the street lighting. PWD officials disclosed that a few touching-up tasks remained, while the rest of the project, including cementing, streetscaping, installing CCTV cameras, among other things, had been finished. The Shahjahanabad Redevelopment Corporation (SRDC) started the Chandni Chowk redevelopment project envisioning the restoration of the Mughal esplanade’s lost glory. The work was undertaken by PWD and the revamped 300 metres of the total 1.3 km were opened for public use on Independence Day last year. Thursday will be the first day when the pedestrians will be able to enjoy using the pedestrianised stretch without their progress being hampered by construction activities. A canal ran the length of this road when Chandni Chowk was laid out by the 17th century Mughal emperor Shah Jahan. Its clear water reflected the moonlight, lending the place a stunning air and its name, Moonlight Square. The redevelopment plan did not aim to revive the old canal, filled up by the British, only to form a 3.5-metre central verge that would house the electric transformers, police booths and toilets. Meanwhile, the carriageway of the Jama Masjid road from Daryaganj to Kashmere Gate has been closed for all vehicular traffic for the next one month because PWD is carrying out development work at Red Fort (from Digambar Lal Jain Mandir to Old Lajpat Rai Market) under the SRDC project to redevelop the stretch in Chandni Chowk from Lal Jain Mandir to Fatehpuri Masjid. Officials have issued a traffic advisory, informing motorists that some alternative roads will remain open to allow traffic movement. The road from Daryaganj to Old Delhi Railway Station will remain open. A PWD official said that traffic signages have been put up at appropriate locations for the convenience of the road users, and an adequate traffic staff has been deployed to ensure the smooth and uninterrupted flow of traffic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/finally-leave-cars-care-behind-at-chandni-chowk/articleshow/81768652.cms||Pankhuri Yadav
---||Coimbatore||DMK sets out to seize Kinathukadavu from AIADMK||Kinathukadavu will see a tough fight this time, with the two major Dravidian parties fielding their heavyweights from the assembly constituency. While S Damodaran had brought victory to the AIADMK thrice from the segment, DMK’s Kurichi Prabhakaran had brought down the ruling party’s winning margin considerably in the 2016 outing. And this time, the DMK would be aiming nothing less than a win.In the 2016 assembly election, the DMK had lost the segment to the AIADMK by just a whisker. Kurichi Prabhakaran, who lost to AIADMK candidate A Shanmugam by just 1,332 votes, is hopeful of sending his new opponent Damodaran packing this time. And the AIADMK seems to have brought Damodaran back to the fight from the segment for a commanding victory, which he had provided the party in his earlier three outings.Former chief minister the late Jayalalithaa had denied ticket to Damodaran in the last election for falling out with S P Velumani. Damodaran eventually supported O Panneerselvam faction in 2017 – the sole reason why he is back in fight this year.Since the gounder community has a strong presence in the constituency, the AIADMK seems to have played its cards safely by fielding a member from the community. Municipal administration minister S P Velumani’s relatives and gounder community have a major presence in Madukkarai and surrounding areas and the votes are likely to go for Damodaran.Kurichi Prabhakaran, on the other hand, belongs to konar community, which has a major presence at Kurichi, Sundarapuram, Vellalore and surrounding areas.However, the deciding factor wouldn’t be both the gounder and konar communities. There is a vast migrant population at Malumichampatti, Othakkalmandapam and surrounding areas and it would be their votes that would determine the winner. Formed in 1967, Kinathukadavu assembly constituency has favoured the DMK four times, while the AIADMK has won the seat eight times. Most of the areas in the constituency are covered under Aliyar water scheme.The constituency is both an agricultural and industrial belt. Many engineering companies are setting up units at Malumichampatti and Othakkalmandapam in the segment. G Rajendran, a local resident, said while Kinathukadavu taluk was formed in 2012, taluk office was yet to be opened because of an ongoing land dispute. “It is a town panchayat and it should be upgraded to a municipality. The state government has also failed to set up a judicial magistrate court.”He said while Madukkarai taluk was formed two years later in 2014, the government had set up a judicial magistrate court there.Pointing out that there was a significant population of farmers in the constituency, Rajendran also called on the political parties to set up an uzhavar sandhai in the segment for the welfare of farmers.While the conversion of meter gauge to broad gauge has been completed between Coimbatore and Pollachi, the Southern Railway is yet to operate trains between the two destinations. The electorate has demanded the political parties to take steps to resume the passenger train services on the stretch.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/dmk-sets-out-to-seize-kinathukadavu-from-aiadmk/articleshow/81749033.cms||A Subburaj

Candidates of Mapuxekaracho Ekvott panel Sudhir Kandolkar and Tarak Arolkar, told media persons that the former councillor has obtained a caste certificate from the secretary of the Traditional Fishermen's Association of North Goa citing that he belongs to the Christian fishing community only to contest in ward no 7 which is reserved for OBC in the new notification . They claimed that the former councillor does not belong to that caste. Kandolkar has demanded a probe into the case and has called for action against such associations for issuing fake certificates on political pressure. The former councillor has, however, refuted the charges saying that his detractors are making allegations as they can’t defeat him in the ward. Elections dates to five municipalities are yet to be announced.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fake-caste-certificate-complaint-filed-against-former-mapusa-councillor/articleshow/81750625.cms||---

It was contended by the state public information officer that police is not bound to publish the names as ordered by the State Information Commission as per RTI Act (section 4). In the judgment, the high court said, “Having considered the entire facts, I am of the view that the information authority cannot shield the names of those officers who have been found guilty or were dismissed from service on charges of corruption or human right violations. The petitioners will not be justified in shielding the names of such officers and will be bound to publish the same notwithstanding the fact that Section 4 does not oblige them to publish such information.” At the same time, the name of officers against whom an offence has been established on investigation but a conclusive finding has not been arrived at by a court of law, need not be published, the high court said. All other directions in the State Information Commission’s order should be strictly complied with and the information should be published in the website of Kerala Police within 30 days, the high court ordered. In an order on April 24, 2019, the State Information Commission had made four categories and had ordered for publishing information on the first three categories. The first category included officers convicted for corruption or were removed from service after inquiry. The second comprised of officers convicted by a court or removed from service for acts of human rights violations such as use of abusive language, misbehaviour towards complainants, wrongful confinement, sexual abuse, rape, etc. The third category were those cases involving corruption or human rights violations in which the investigating officer laid final report before court. The fourth category was of cases in which investigation is pending.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/publish-names-of-guilty-officers-hc-tells-police/articleshow/81749065.cms||---

Those booked were private contractor Sayaji Fadtare (51) and R K Gupta (80), owner of the company. Police said Bridesh Rajbhar (37), Dinesh Rajbhar (26) and Mohammed Ashraf (25) were among five hired by the contractor. They said Gupta wanted to restart his company, so he hired Fadtare to clean the premises, but did not have a written agreement. Fadtare hired five from Govandi in Mumbai.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Kids lift Latur village out of water scarcity||They say it takes a village to raise a child. In a curious case, it took children to lift Vaishali Nagar, a village in Latur — that has been the face of Marathwada’s acute water scarcity — out of a crisis. Water shortage is a familiar story in Maharashtra. But 2018 was different for around 1,200 people who had no drinking water, groundwater levels had plummeted and hand pumps ran dry three months after the monsoon. When scorching summer heat would drive up thirst and water tankers came to the rescue, fights would break out between women queuing up for water. With lives and dreams revolving around water, access to it determined choices families could make. And children often bore the brunt. With the sun blazing at 38 degrees, 11-year-old Asha — instead of attending school — would walk three days a week to a borewell a km from home, standing for hours on a baking pavement and trudging home with heavy water pitchers balanced with practised perfection on her waist and head. For 12-year-old Priya, collecting water was about saving her frail and enervated mother from collapsing in the heat and her father from shutting down their grocery store for a day. Like Asha and Priya’s parents, most in Vaishali Nagar are daily wagers. As a desperate measure, fetching and hauling pitchers of water, sometimes over several miles, fell disproportionately on children, especially girls. But what Asha or Priya did not imagine was that bringing up their water woes — that snatched away time they had to study or go to school, or even play — at a meeting of ‘bal panchayat’ or children’s parliament, would change what had been a constant concern for years. Modelled on a gram panchayat and informally recognised by the district administration, many villages in the state have witnessed this unique revolution of a powerful children’s collective. They usually comprise 25 children aged 11-18 and are guided by local NGOs. The small, dusty village of Sategaon in Parbhani district was the first in Maharashtra to develop this model of child governance in 2000. Today, the state has over 200 bal panchayats. Initially, they focused on bringing drop-outs back to school by convincing parents, raising questions about condition of schools and volunteering to clean them up. Today, they fight social evils like child marriage and child labour; work for birth registration, tree plantation and campaign against children’s addiction to tobacco. Members meet at least twice a month to learn about child rights, skills and discuss issues in their village, to bring them to the notice of the gram sabha, and get them solved. So, when complaining about grievances to teachers or parents was not an option, Asha and Priya, along with other members, decided to fight for themselves and the 200 children of their village, and place their demand for potable water facilities before their gram panchayat. Predictably, adults did not take them seriously when few kids turned up at their door. “They gave children a fleeting assurance of organising a water tanker but nothing happened. Around 30 children turned up again in few weeks, this time with a letter when they realised the children meant business,” recounted Saroj Pawar, a mentor from SOS Children’s Villages of India, a non-profit child care organization that helped form the Vaishali Nagar bal panchayat. “The sarpanch had to call for a meeting with the children and other village elders,” said Pawar. Turned out the village was sitting on a water ATM scheme which was never initiated as people were not willing to pay. Breaking ice with villagers unwilling to spend money on water was the next challenge for the children, who went about convincing neighbours. “We visited homes till they were clear about what this would mean to us children, and improve their lives,” recalls Asha. After six months, the panchayat got a borewell and a water purifier plant installed at Vaishali Nagar in a symbolic gesture on August 15, the day of India’s Independence. “We helped clear the area of shrubs and rocks when the borewell was being drilled, drew rangolis for the opening and got to inaugurate the water ATM,” gushed Priya. It has been two years since. The kiosk runs, with people inserting Rs5 coins for 20 litres of water. “Pleading by children has an emotional appeal that creates greater ethical pressure on adults. Hearing children speak, the community starts questioning their own lack of concern and paying heed to issues,” explained Pawar. While safe and affordable water at the “magical” press of a button has brought a smile to residents of this once water-stressed patch, for the children it has been a fount of hope. “We don’t have to miss school any more, no more fights between neighbours and water-borne diseases have come down,” said Asha and Priya. Today, they harbour dreams of being a police officer and a doctor. But before that they have other missions to accomplish. “We have water but hygiene is still a problem. Next on our bal panchayat agenda is getting the gram sabha to ensure a regular garbage collection truck.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-kids-lift-latur-village-out-of-water-scarcity/articleshow/81749804.cms||Mohua Das

As per the official records, the elephant was 52 years old. However, according to veterinarians, who were examining the tusker at various points, said it must be about 58 years old. The elephant was ailing for about a year after it developed an abscess on its back. Subsequently, it ruptured and developed into an ulcer. Its food intake also became less after it had developed some digestion problems. The forest department had imposed a ban on parading the elephant after that, and it was under treatment at the devaswom’s elephant yard anakotta. It had collapsed on Sunday evening. With the death of Keshavan, the number of elephants with Guruvayur Devaswom has reduced to 45. The elephant was donated to Guruvayur Devaswom by Nakeri Vasudevan Namboodiri in 2000. Kesavan was a much sought-after presence in various festivals. TNN||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/tusker-valiya-kesavan-of-guruvayur-temple-dies/articleshow/81749070.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Vaccine turnout drops to a 3rd to just 11,000 on Holi||MUMBAI: Low-key Holi celebrations reflected on the city’s vaccine graph as well. Merely 11,229 people—almost half of them aged over 60—turned up for Covid-19 vaccination on Monday as against the 35,000 to 45,000 vaccinations registered on most days. Senior BMC officials said only 108 centres worked at half the capacity due to Holi. “We didn’t want to break the momentum gathered since January 16 and hence decided to hold a curtailed vaccination drive on Holi as well,” said BMC additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. Several cities across the state didn’t hold a vaccination drive on Monday due to the festival. In Mumbai, 22 of the usual hospital-vaccine centres didn’t offer vaccination on Monday. The city has so far administered 10,98,081 vaccine shots. Of these, 9,53,036 have taken their first shot only. Recipients have to take two doses of the Covid-19 vaccine (while Covaxin can be taken 28 days apart, the latest government circular on Covishield said the shots can be taken up to eight weeks apart). The BMC plans to increase the daily vaccination to 75,000 a day by adding more private hospitals as vaccine centres. The BMC commissioner, I S Chahal, had previously announced that the BMC would target 1 lakh vaccinations a day. “We are also in the process of identifying centres located within slum pockets,'' said Kakani. The BMC may allow vaccination at some of its dispensaries. But the BMC’s first initiative to vaccinate slumdwellers at a centre close to them has not worked so far. In fact, on Monday, Dharavi reported the lowest turnout for its vaccination drive started a week ago. Only 45 recipients turned up for the Covaxin shot at BMC’s’Chotta Sion Hospital’ urban centre located right in Dharavi. Officials said the reason could be that not many would be aware that the vaccine was being administered on Monday due to Holi festival. Over the weekend, though, the response was better with over 451 recipients being administered the jab on March 26-27. The BMC set up five booths at the urban health centre to vaccinate 500 people a day. The drive is yet to pick up pace though. Around 1.7 lakh of the 8 lakh population here comprises senior citizens. Meanwhile, the state on Saturday managed to vaccinate 2,31,277 people, including 1,26,422 senior citizens. The state has plans to vaccinate three lakh people every day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-vaccine-turnout-drops-to-a-3rd-to-just-11000-on-holi/articleshow/81749076.cms||Malathy Iyer

The government should probe this allegation. It is a damaging statement,” Man Singh told TOI on Monday. On the ombudsman controversy, he said: “They have been avoiding the appointment of the Ombudsman for the last one-and-a-half year for the simple reason that he will be flooded with several complaints. When he looks into the complaints and asks for evidence and information from the office-bearers, they will be exposed. To save their skin, the office-bearers don’t want an ombudsman.” Man Singh also raised a technical point. “How can they sign the accounts from 2017-18 and present the secretary’s report for that period. What right do they have when they were not in office during that period? But by signing the accounts, haven’t they made themselves responsible for the wrongs done in that period. These guys should be presenting the 2019-20 accounts. They also had an AGM and Special GM but they haven’t submitted the minutes to be ratified. It is a clear violation of the bye-laws.” Man also said that the HCA bye-laws need to be changed. “The most unfortunate part is that the present constitution doesn’t suit the association. The Supreme Court direction to mirror the BCCI Constitution is fine but how much of it will be useful to the association is not mentioned. For the last six months, I have been after the office-bearers to redo the constitution. They formed a constitution sub-committee but nothing was done about it,” he said. He also hit out at Shivlal Yadav. “Shivlal said the general body is supreme but what was he doing when he was in power?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/office-bearers-dont-want-an-ombudsman-man-singh/articleshow/81749771.cms||Solomon S Kumar

It is atrocious. They have brought the game to a new low,” he told ToI on Monday. “The office-bearers are not on the same page and I am not sure what could be the reason for that. They all got elected from the same group but they don’t seem to be working together. It’s a sad thing,” he said while analyzing the mismanagement in the HCA. “You have to learn man-management. You have to sometimes allow them some leeway. You can’t always bulldoze your way through. You have to give something and expect that they cooperate in return.” Shivlal said the Apex Council had no business to discuss the appointment of the Ombudsman. “First off all, it is not in the purview of the Apex Council. They do not have the right to even discuss the issue as it is wholly the prerogative of the general body. So where is the point of the Apex Council even discussing the matter? They did the mistake by discussing it. They could have simply said that we will leave it to the AGM to decide it. They did not do it and when some members objected to his name all this mess started,” he said. The former Test player also said there was no need to appoint the CAC and selectors when the season has ended. “They are ending the three-day league but are appointing the CAC and selectors. Do they simply want to make payment to the selectors? Instead, they should be appointing the CEO, CFO etc as they are needed to run the administration,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/man-management-skills-severely-lacking-shivlal/articleshow/81749792.cms||Solomon S Kumar

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Action plan to trace overlap of heat islands, Covid cases||HYDERABAD: Officials across departments have been asked to be vigilant for heatwave conditions — and to mitigate its effects — at a time when Covid cases are on the rise. As part of this effort, the Telangana State Development Planning Society (TSDPS) has prepared detailed heatwave action plan, 2021. With Covid-19 amplifying risks for those already vulnerable to extreme heat, the TSDPS in its action plan has asked departments to identify where local heat islands occur and where this may overlap with high incidence or risk of Covid-19. Telangana is highly prone to hot weather conditions and heatwave, with 14 of the 31 districts identified as highly vulnerable. According to data for 2014 to 2020, these districts had 21 to 40 heatwave days in a year. “Health services and systems will need to prepare for a potential increase in patients during a heatwave, during a time when they are already stretched with Covid-19 patients. Health workers wearing PPE working in inadequately cooled conditions are also at high risk of heat stress,” read the action plan. As per TSDPS data, from 2014 to 2020, 1,089 deaths have been recorded due to heatwave across Telangana. Mercury levels have already touched 40 to 42 degree Celsius in many districts and are set to touch 40 degree Celsius in Hyderabad by March 31. “Few places in northern and central Telangana have recorded two to three degree Celsius above normal temperature. In the next three to four days, dry weather conditions will prevail and maximum temperature will be around 39 to 40 degree Celsius and minimum temperature around 22 to 24 degree Celsius,” said Naga Ratna, in-charge director, IMD, Hyderabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/action-plan-to-trace-overlap-of-heat-islands-covid-cases/articleshow/81749805.cms||Preeti Biswas

We are legally fighting to save these mangroves,” said activist Sunil Agarwal of Save Navi Mumbai Environment group. “I had recently complained to the forest department and the Bombay high court appointed mangroves panel on how the tidal water flow through these mangroves in Nerul is being blocked. The private guards also do not allow anyone to go near the site. The forest department should take over these mangrove forests before it is too late,”added Agarwal. The director of NatConnect Foundation, B N Kumar, said, “The recurring fires in mangroves, forests and mangrove buffer zones appear to be part of a land grab racket. Dumping garbage and then burning it is also an encroachment ploy.” Last week, a fire was reported on the edge of the mangroves near Vashi railway station complex. RTI activist Anarjit Chauhanexplained, “As per the Forest Fire Rules of 1981, such deemed forests like the mangroves can be taken over by the forest department even if fires are observed within 1 km of its buffer zone.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-greens-spot-another-fire-at-nerul-mangroves/articleshow/81749814.cms||Vijay Singh

The strict measures taken by the Nashik Road prison officials over the past year has ensured that the inmates remain infection-free.The Covid-19 pandemic broke out in March 2020 and soon the entire district was in its grip. Even as cases continued to increase, officials at the Nashik Road prison followed all the guidelines issued by their department to prevent inside the 200-acre prison complex. In the initial stage of the outbreak, a closed school was taken over by the central jail officers to house the new inmates for a period of 14 days before they were taken inside the jail premises. Over the past three months, the jail authorities have started conducting antigen and RT-PCR tests of the inmates coming into the jail, said superintendent of the Nashik Road central prison Pramod Wagh. “If the incoming inmates test positive, they are sent to the Covid care centre (CCC). Every day, we have around 20-25 individuals who have to be lodged in the jail. Over the past three months, we have found approximately 15 such people who were Covid-positive. They were sent to the CCC for treatment before they could be lodged in the jail,” said Wagh.

---||Mumbai||BMC chief tells ward officers to take over beds in private hospitals||MUMBAI: With the second Covid wave gathering momentum, the BMC chief on Monday empowered ward-level officers to take control of beds in private hospitals in their respective areas for managing Covid caseloads in the city. He said they could take help of police personnel, if necessary, to facilitate this process and prevent private facilities from skirting the centralised bed allocation system. Officers can also deploy teachers or other staff in shifts to track bed allotment in nursing homes. With Covid cases rising rapidly, the civic corporation has reiterated the need to streamline hospital bed allocation through its war room. It will now follow a hierarchical order to fill up nursing homes in each area before assigning cases to larger facilities. Since the outbreak of the pandemic, the state has instituted an 80:20 rule which allows local administrations to oversee the handling of up to 80% of the bed capacity in private hospitals. The remaining 20% are at the hospital's own discretion. BMC commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal, issuing a circular on Monday, also reinforced the policy to keep asymptomatic Covid patients who have no co-morbidities at home, to ensure prompt availability of beds to the needy. The note said hospitals should urgently discharge asymptomatic Covid patients in order to keeps beds handy for the seriously ill. Chahal said despite orders that allotment of beds for Covid patients should be done through the centralised ward war room mechanism, patients are being directly admitted by hospitals without intimation to authorities. Defining protocols for allotting beds, his note said initially beds at the ward level in nursing homes and hospitals need to be exhausted before the war rooms looks at ESIS hospitals as a second option. In case of both options not yielding a vacant slot, beds in private hospitals must be the go-to option. Finally, if all else fails, beds in various jumbo field hospitals like those at Mulund, Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) or SevenHills would be the back-up. And in case, beds are not available in these facilities either, then apex government and BMC hospitals will be a final recourse. A ward level official said looking at the surge in Covid cases, they have already started reserving beds once again in private hospitals; orders have been issued to empower assistant commissioners of every ward. The officer may deploy police or other staff including BMC teachers in selected nursing homes to facilitate this process. In the wake of the fire at Sunrise Hospital in Bhandup that killed nine patients, Chahal said structural stability and fire audit of all Covid facilities needs to be undertaken with immediate effect.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bmc-chief-tells-ward-officers-to-take-over-beds-in-pvt-hospitals-in-mumbai/articleshow/81750667.cms||Richa Pinto

People will be given tickets on payment of the Rs 5 fee, and each ticket permits the shopper access to the market only for an hour. Anyone breaching the one-hour deadline will be fined Rs 500. The Rs 5 fee would be collected by the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) for various Covid-prevention measures including sanitization of the area. The police, meanwhile, will maintain a strict bandobast at the marketplaces. Vijay Kharat, the Zone II DCP, conducted a meeting of officials of the Ambad, Satpur and Indiranagar police station on Monday to tell them about the measures they must carry out in the markets within their respective jurisdictions. The new rule will apply to the main market area in the city, the Nashik market committee, the Pawan Nagar market in Ambad, Ashok Nagar market in Satpur and Kalanagar market in Indiranagar. The markets would be sealed with only one entry point. People would have to take the Rs 5 coupon at the time of entry. Hawkers, vegetable vendors and shopkeepers would be issued passes. Those residing in the market areas would be allowed inside only after their identity cards are checked Many people described this move as ridiculous. “People visiting markets often bargain for as little as Rs 2. Here the police have decided to simply collect Rs 5 from every customer. If they want, they can control the crowd even without taking this money,” said Neeta Ajbe, a resident of Nashik Road area. Prafulla Sancheti, the president of the Nashik traders’ association, called this a one-sided decision as the traders and vendors were not taken into confidence. Instead of taking such a decision, the administration may as well have decided on a lockdown, Sancheti said. Speaking to TOI, Kharat said: “The exercise is for disaster management, and not to ruin businesses. The aim is to control the crowds. Under Section 43 of the Bombay Police Act, the commissioner of police is empowered to take certain decisions when the Epidemic Act is in force. The collection of money would be done by the NMC. The police would deploy a bandobast to ensure there is no overcrowding.” He said that the new system would come in force from Tuesday or Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-citizens-must-pay-rs-5-for-hour-long-market-visits/articleshow/81748068.cms||Santosh Sonawane

Around 25% of hospital beds in Mumbai are vacant but complaints about scarcity are rising. “Over 5,000 cases get added to Mumbai’s total Covid-19 tally every day, and only a few thousand beds (2,565 as per BMC’s dashboard) are vacant across the city’s public and private hospitals,” said a doctor from the suburbs. BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani denied there was a“bed crisis”. He said the problem is of disproportionate demand for certain facilities. “Most cases in the second wave are among people in high rises who talk about their insurance policies. They want a private bed. Many are specific that they want a single bed and not a twin-sharing arrangement. It is this demand that is skewing the bed availability,” said Kakani. Only 652 of 3,269 beds in the city’s private hospitals are vacant. “We have asked private hospitals to increase bed capacity to 5,000 soon,” he added. At Sunday’s meeting chaired by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, bed availability wasa key discussion point during a debate on the need for a lockdown in the state. “In many districts, beds are not available, and (available) capacity of health facilities is not able to cope up with the spread of disease,” said health secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas. In public health strategies, lockdowns are a pandemic-control tool used when the healthcare system is overwhelmed or inadequate. Overall, the state has 3.57 lakh isolation beds of which 30% or 1.07 lakh are occupied. Of the 60,349 oxygen beds, 12,701 are occupied, and 1,881 of the 9,030 ventilators are in use right now. A senior state official said beds are available in most districts except some places like Aurangabad and Pune. In Raigad, for instance, 22% of ICU beds and 11% of the 3,444 regular beds are occupied, said district collector Nidhi Chaudhari. “In many districts, asymptomatic patients have occupied hospital beds out of panic. We are asking district administrations to ensure better bed management and prioritise people who have symptoms and are also co-morbid,” said the official. The Centre in a review meeting with high caseload states on Saturday had said some districts in the state were reporting higher deaths as people in home isolation were deteriorating and reporting late to hospitals and suggested the state isolate patients in CCCs rather than at home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/25-hosp-beds-in-mumbai-still-vacant-but-pressure-more-on-pvt-facilities/articleshow/81750674.cms||Malathy Iyer

In a letter to municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal, standing committee Yashwant Jadhav and mayor Kishori Pednekar, both from Shiv Sena, have mooted the idea to prevent flooding in the area. Last week, BMC started digging up the 13-acre Pramod Mahajan Udyan at Senapati Bapat Marg in Dadar (west) to construct an underground water holding pond. Residents are up in arms against the project fearing they will lose the massive green space that is home to hundreds of trees, birds and fish ponds. Times ViewTackling flooding on arterial roads is important but this can't be done at the cost of losing prime open spaces.There is a major dearth of open spaces in the city and the Byculla playground is extensively used by citizens. The BMC must look for an alternative location for the water holding pond.Jadhav, in his letter, has called for construction of the water storage tank at Byculla to prevent flooding on the arterial Dr Ambedkar Road. The playground is located along Dr Ambedkar and ES Patanwala Road. “The BMC has taken up work of constructing underground water storage tanks to prevent water logging. At Byculla also, the agency carrying out storm water drain (SWD) work on ES Patanwala Road must be asked to construct the underground water tank,” the letter states. It further says the tank will prevent flooding at Hindmata and Byculla since the water will go to the Britannia pumping station. Besides, the capacity of the tank will be one crore litres of water and this can be used for trees at the Byculla zoo. The MNS, which had opposed expansion of the museum for which a part of the playground was going to be used as a parking lot, has voiced dissent. “The playground must remain untouched. How many open spaces is the BMC going to destroy for the underground water tanks? Let us first see if they actually prevent flooding. This seems to be a big scam and they are giving work orders without tenders,” said MNS leader Sandeep Deshpande.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/sena-wants-underground-tank-at-byculla-playground-in-mumbai/articleshow/81749837.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Since 2018, a private omnibus stand has been functioning from the Southern Railway property.“In recent times, the omnibuses are frequently seen parked over the Royal road near the Williams road junction. Coimbatore-bound buses are often caught in the bottlenecks,” N Selvendran, a resident of E Pudur said. Transport corporation employees also said the private buses from Madurai, southern districts and proceeding towards Chennai stand near the entrances of the Ccentral bus stand and poach passengers approaching SETC buses. “We are frequently booking cases against the omnibuses spotted occupying the roads and causing trouble.

---||Ahmedabad||Rs 267cr okayed for water, civic projects||Ahmedabad: A major project worth Rs 267 crore to lay water supply lines and other civic utlities along SP Ring Road has been given the go ahead. These lines will serve 45 villages within 2.5km to 3km of the Ring Road . The project is being implemented by AUDA and will be completed in two and a half years. “Apart from metered 24x7 water supply, storm water drains and sewerage are being laid. We admit that internal roads will be dug up over the next 19 months,” said a senior AUDA official. Imediately, Town Planning Schemes 1,2 and 3 will be catered to. The project was initiated after the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) took stock of the civic facilities in the villages of Chiloda-Naroda Gaam and Kathwada, and parts of seven others, Sanathal, Bilaspur, Aslali, Geratnagar, Khodiyar, Bilasiya and Ranasan, which are now in AMC limits. “We felt that since there will be several villages, which like Bopal-Ghuma will be incorporated into the municipal limits, there was a necessity to set a framework for civic services,” said AMC commissioner Mukesh Kumar during an earlier interaction after presenting the budget. When the 2011 development plan for Ahmedabad became operational in 2014, the AMC’s civic limits covered 466 sq km and the new areas added 39 sq km to this, taking the total to 505 sq km. A senior AUDA official said, “Besides other facilities like drainage and sewerage, the water quality on the periphery of Ahmedabad was going from bad to worse with total dissolved solids (TDS) levels as high as 1,500 parts per million (ppm) at some places, against the WHO standards of acceptable TDS levels of 300 to 500 ppm.” The areas of Bopal and Ghuma were carved out in 1951, with the Bopal panchayat covering 565 hectares and Ghuma 600 hectares. Bopal and Ghuma were included within AUDA limits for TP schemes in 2008 and 2011 respectively. In 2009 an expansion plan to include 69 villages in Ahmedabad, taking the city’s area to 566 sq km. “The infrastructure for Ghuma is a necessity now as it is located in within 2km of the SP Ring Road, 5km from the Sarkhej-Gandhinagar Road and 8km away from Sanand. Bopal is abutted by SP Ring Road and is only 2.5km from the commercial district of Prahladnagar,” adds the AUDA official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/rs-267cr-okayed-for-water-civic-projects/articleshow/81766779.cms||---

If there is any official communication, we will definitely inform the public and the media,” the newly-appointed collector told reporters on Monday.First information report (FIR) was filed by the city crime branch (CCB), Trichy, against three people including a lawyer for giving bribe and a head constable and a special sub-inspector for accepting it for casting postal votes. “As of now, FIR has been filed in the case and it has been transferred to CBCID for further investigations,” the collector said. A senior officer from Chennai arrived in Trichy on Monday for further investigations. The alleged bribery hit the headlines after a team of police officers searched the 14 police stations in the city limits and seized cash to the tune of Rs70,000 kept in covers in two police stations on Saturday. Since the police stations fall under Trichy West constituency where DMK principal secretary K N Nehru and AIADMK candidate V Padmanadhan are the main contenders, social media become flooded with posts and messages that the policemen were bribed. Nehru reacted strongly to such posts saying that he was no way connected with such incidents and it was an attempt to defame him. Padmanadhan petitioned the election officials to take action against Nehru over the issue. Meanwhile, commissioner of police, Trichy suspended six cops including the two who were mentioned in the FIR. The collector also said that the reports have been sent to the election commission of India (ECI) on the seizure of cash in Pettavaithalai and Manapparai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/postal-vote-bribery-cbcid-begins-probe/articleshow/81750672.cms||---
---||Chennai||‘Birth’ remark: DMK’s A Raja apologises to Edappadi K Palaniswami||COIMBATORE: Facing protests and a possible political backlash for his remarks on chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami’s birth, DMK deputy general secretary A Raja on Monday apologised to the AIADMK leader. Raja said, “I express my regret from the bottom of my heart for the speech which was quoted out of context. If CM Palaniswami was genuinely hurt, without any politics in it, I have no hesitation in offering my heartfelt apology.” He said the AIADMK was using the issue for political mileage. “Still, I don’t want these remarks to be a stain on my political career. So, I am offering an apology,” Raja said. While AIADMK social media groups churned out content to project the episode as a DMK-is-against-women election plank, the police on Sunday filed a case against Raja.  Chief electoral officer Satyabrata Sahoo on Monday said a detailed report, along with a video clip of the speech, has been sent to the Election Commission of India. Raja, in his speech, had metaphorically referred to the ‘births’ of EPS and Stalin, arguing that Stalin had come to be the leader the natural way, while EPS becoming the CM was abrupt. Raja said his speech was about the “political personalities” of EPS and Stalin, and it was not a personal attack. “Two days ago, I had explained that my speech was selectively quoted out of context. When the controversy continued, I clarified that defaming EPS or his mother was not my intention,” he said. “While I apologise to EPS, I would like to point out a portion of the judgment given by judge O P Saini in the 2G case. Explaining how the case was framed against me, Saini used four terms – misreading, selective reading, non-reading and out-of-context reading. If one listens to my 40-minute speech, you would give the same verdict in this issue too,” Raja said. Responding to a query on the AIADMKs complaint seeking to debar Raja from campaigning for his remarks, Sahoo said the district election officer and the superintendent of police ould analyse the video clip to see if it invoked IPC sections or CrPC while the ECI would examine if there was violation of the model code of conduct.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/birth-remark-dmks-raja-apologises-to-eps/articleshow/81749834.cms||---
---||Goa||Non-tax filing on rise in state since GST rollout||PANAJI: Ever since the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime was implemented on July 1, 2017, the commercial tax department has seen an 85% increase in the number of taxpayers who have stopped filing returns. The department has also noticed an increase in the number of cases where tax dues have remained unpaid for the last four financial years. Data tabled by the state during the ongoing assembly session shows that the number of tax evasion cases have also increased since 2017-2018. Chief minister Pramod Sawant, who also holds the finance portfolio, released the data on tax defaulters and evasion in response to a question by Porvorim MLA Rohan Khaunte. “Regular assessment of non-filers and defaulters is undertaken by this department to assess and recover the dues. The assessment up to 2016-2017 has been completed and the assessment for 2017-2018 is in progress,” said Sawant in a written reply. The commercial tax department has registered 59 cases of tax evasion in the current financial year for evasion in the earlier financial years. In order to recover dues and collect much-needed revenue for the state, Sawant has asked the department to identify major tax defaulters and to conduct search and seizure operations. According to information, the number of taxpayers who did not file returns stood at 5,096 in 2017-18, but subsequently increased to 6,003 in 2019-20 and 9,459 in 2020-21. Similarly, the number of assessed cases where tax dues were unpaid stood at 7,259 in 2017-18, rose to 8,242 in 2019-20 and has now settled at 7,745 cases in 2020-21. As per GST norms, failure to file returns for more than six months can lead to cancellation of the GST registration. Sawant said that reminders are regularly being sent to defaulting taxpayers. In January 2021, officials of the commercial tax department initiated action against 77 defaulting firms from whom Rs 120 crore was recoverable by way of tax, interest and penalty. The defaulting firms were sole proprietorships, partnership firms, private companies, etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/non-tax-filing-on-rise-in-state-since-gst-rollout/articleshow/81749854.cms||---

The number will be made public for people to report any such violations,” the organisation’s general secretary Iftiyaz Sayed said. The helpline was discussed on Sunday when the national in-charge for Goa, advocate Ansar Indori, held a meeting with the executive committee members of the Goa unit and other NGO representatives. It was also decided to have a workshop and training session on legal awareness with focus on students. “We want people to be made aware of their constitutional and fundamental rights and the law of the land so that people can work to safeguard their rights,” Sayed said. The Goa unit’s president, Ranjan Soloman, detailed the work done by them while several member’s opinions and suggestions for taking work forward were elicited and noted. The national report and work plan were also discussed. Members also discussed the need to set up a state office and the budget for it .

---||India||Assets got before offence not proceeds of crime: HC to ED||HYDERABAD: In a significant ruling, Justice R Raghunandan Rao of the Andhra Pradesh high court has held that the Enforcement Directorate (ED) cannot call assets acquired by an accused as proceeds of crime if they were bought before the commission of such an offence. The judge gave this ruling and ordered the release of the attached assets of an accused, which were bought before the commission of the alleged offence, on March 20. The judge pronounced this order after hearing Kumar Pappu Singh, a resident of Erramanzil Colony in Hyderabad, and some of his companies that challenged the attachment of their assets by ED. In March 2018, the CBI had registered an FIR against Pappu Singh and his companies for allegedly defrauding IDBI Bank's Palangi branch in West Godavari district to an extent of 75 crore. CBI alleged that he availed kisan credit card (KCC) loans in the names of various borrowers and re-routed all the money into his savings account before siphoning of the same. According to the ED, all money made through a crime is crime money or proceeds of crime. Coming to the issue of attachment, ED contended it had attached the old assets of the accused because he exhausted all the fraud money in pisciculture and suffered huge losses there. The judge did not agree with this interpretation and said that even the legislature did not intend this way while amending the Act in 2019 and said that ED might have a case for attaching equal worth of assets if the accused diverted the money to foreign shores. In the instant case, however, the accused had lost the money. Hence, the attachment of his pre-2010 assets cannot be justified, Justice Raghunandan said in his order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/assets-got-before-offence-not-proceeds-of-crime-hc-to-ed/articleshow/81751263.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

According to police, the accused, an inebriated Kovvuru Veerababu, engaged in an argument with two vendors, father and son, who sold eatables out of a food cart.

Veerababu’s father spoke to him and reportedly admonished him for his behaviour. Angered at Singam Yesu for calling his father on him, Veerababu went away and then returned with a car and rammed it into the food cart. Singam Yesu and his son, Singam Siva Ganesh, were badly hurt. Siva Ganesh was taken to Kakinada government hospital where he succumbed to his injuries at midnight Sunday. The 17-year-old Siva Ganesh was a student of class 10.

The CJI was in Goa for the inauguration of the new high court building at Porvorim on Saturday. “We have come as far as we can and will continue to do whatever is possible to protect our heritage, but today we need the support of those who understand the immeasurable and irreplaceable value of our precious wild ecosystems. We hope you will recognise the urgency driving our letter and do what you can to make sure that Goa’s identity and future remain secure at this very critical juncture,” they wrote. The letter points out that the managers of the three infrastructure projects — the rail double-tracking of Castlerock-Collem-Vasco stretch, four-laning of the Panaji-Belagavi national highway and the 440 KV power project — have applied to cut 38,724 trees, which will lead to severe fragmentation in the National Park and the Bhagwan Mahaveer Wildlife Sanctuary, including near the iconic Dudhsagar waterfall. The letter states that youth of Goa have been writing letters and signing petitions addressed to elected representatives, asking them to “save Mollem from these destructive projects,” but to no avail. They wrote that they have been spreading awareness about the importance of the protected areas and “asking for a vision of development for Goa that is rooted in cultural, scientific and constitutional values,” in an effort to draw attention to the matter. “We want to live in a Goa that future generations can thrive in, based on the principle of intergenerational equity, which states that natural resources are a shared inheritance,” they wrote.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/youth-write-letter-to-cji-on-mollem-infra-projects/articleshow/81740668.cms||---

Addressing the media at Kasaragod Press Club on Monday, Surendran said it was for the first time a constituent in the LDF has confirmed the stand taken by BJP on the issue. "CPM will not be able to continue its elusive stand. Though it was the stand taken by Christian community which made Jose K Mani come out with the statement, the fact remains a fact," he said. Surendran added that when BJP had raised the issue, CPM had taken a stand in favour of extremists. "People of the state would like to know the stand of the chief minister and CPM regarding love jihad," he said. When asked to comment on Jose's statement, Vijayan evaded the question by saying that he had not come across the statement. He told reporters in Kannur that the question should be posed to Jose himself. Surendran said that LDF government was taking a provocative stand on Sabarimala issue and the statements by its top leaders' show that it is continuing its earlier stand. "Sabarimala will not remain safe as long as this government remains in power. Though some ministers had backtracked from their earlier stand following protests by believers, CPM central leadership and the CM has taken a public stand against them. It shows that LDF government is not going to change its stand and will set the stage for the entry of young women at the temple," he said. Surendran alleged that huge malpractices were being carried out in postal voting, violating EC guidelines. "There is concern whether the moves by CPM to conduct electoral fraud with the help of a section of election officials will lead to conflict. There are over 3,000 bogus votes in Kasaragod and Manjeswaram and EC has not taken steps to remove them from electoral rolls," he added. Surendran alleged that there is a deal between CPM and IUML in Manjeswaram and Uduma.

The state mines and geology department has issued a circular allowing resumption of operations in stone quarries and crushers with the condition that they should secure a no-objection certificate from the directorate general of mines safety (DGMS) within 90 days on use of explosives. "Besides obtaining the certificate, quarry owners must submit an undertaking over safe usage of explosives," mines and geology minister Murugesh Nirani said here on Monday. Closure of quarries caused Rs 300-cr loss: MinMinister Murugesh Nirani said “barely 10%” of the state’s 2,500 units have approval from DGMS. “This is because quarry owners are finding it difficult to purchase, store and use explosives due to tough conditions imposed by the directorate. The department has decided to ease the process by changing guidelines, he said. Approval from the DGMS is mandatory for quarries which sit on more than five acres of land and use more than 2kg of explosives. The minister, who took stock of stone mining activities in the state since they suspended operations in February, said closure resulted in a Rs 300-crore loss to the exchequer and affected livelihood of thousands of people depending on them. Quarry owners and associations had recently met Nirani. He said it’s impossible to operate quarries without using explosives. “Mining ought to continue as owners, who have invested money by availing loans, are now facing hardship to repay them,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-allows-2500-quarries-and-crushers-to-resume-operations/articleshow/81751276.cms||---

They sought chief minister BS Yediyurappa and home minister Basavaraj Bommai’s help to find her and urged courts not to record her statement as she was under duress. Shivakumar, who was in Belagavi, rejected the charge, saying he had nothing to do with the case. “Let the investigation happen. They (family members) were speaking under pressure. If they have proof (of my involvement), let them share it,” he said. The woman’s whereabouts have not been known ever since a sex-for-job complaint was filed earlier this month and Ramesh, while denying wrongdoing, resigned as the water resources minister. She has released video statements, but is yet to appear before a judge or the SIT probing the case. Her father alleged that Shivakumar was forcing her to make certain allegations. The family spoke to the media in Belagavi amid reports that she would appear before a judge to record her statement. Her lawyer moved an application of requisition before a magistrate on Monday, seeking permission to produce her. “She should be given at least four days to be with the family or kept under court supervision and provided counselling,” the father said. “We got to know through the media that our daughter would appear before a court. We request the chief minister, home minister and all the judges... you have to consider that our daughter is under pressure for the past 20 to 25 days and has been forced to make statements.” The woman’s brother alleged that she had been acting as per Shivakumar’s directions since she was paid some money. He shared no material to support the charge. “The video and audio statements that have come out so far, and ones that will in future, all of them are under pressure from people who made the CD and Shivakumar,” the brother claimed, adding that she had not been in touch with the family for over 20 days. The woman had alleged that her parents were pressured to give statements in Ramesh’s favour. The family denied this. “I have the strength to take care of my daughter. Who are these politicians? Have they brought her up or given her education? I don’t need anyone’s help,” the father said, adding that he had no connection with the Jarkiholi clan or anyone in politics. The mother claimed that about four months ago, her daughter told her that Shivakumar’s associates were helping her find a job. “I advised her to stay away from politicians,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/cd-case-womans-family-blames-dk-shivakumar/articleshow/81751297.cms||---

Nimta BJP leader Gopal Majumdar's mother, Shova Rani Majumdar, died at home after she was treated at a nursing home for 23 days following the February 27 assault. Local BJP candidate from North Dum Dum Archana Majumdar (not a relative) signed Shova Rani's death certificate, which said the latter died of injuries suffered during the February assault. Union home minister Shah tweeted to express his "anguish over the demise of Bengal's daughter... brutally beaten by TMC goons". "The pain and wounds of her family will haunt Mamata didi. Bengal will fight for a violence-free tomorrow, Bengal will fight for a safer state for our sisters and mothers," he added. CM Banerjee condemned the assault during a rally in Nandigram but questioned Shah's silence on the law-and-order situation in BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh, specifically mentioning Hathras: "I am not sure why and how she died. I condemn any assault on women. Amit Shah has tweeted to comment on Bengal's condition. Why does he keep mum on Uttar Pradesh, Hathras...?" Gopal's complaint prompted cops to register an FIR, arrest five persons - Tinku Chandra, Kamal Saha, Subho Chandra, Ron Chakraborty and Laltu Bala - and submit a charge sheet to a Barrackpore court on March 4. The five broke into their home on February 27 and threatened him for "working for the BJP", Gopal alleged. Shova Rani was assaulted when she protested and was left on the floor, groaning in pain, he added. She was admitted to a private nursing home a few days later, where she was treated for 23 days before she returned home. A BJP delegation brought the death to the Election Commission's notice on Monday as local BJP workers took to the streets and gheraoed the Nimta police station. Trinamool Congress MP Saugata Roy, however, refuted any Trinamool link. "It was a trouble between neighbours, which is now being politicised," he said. North Dum Dum (Town) Trinamool Congress president Bidhan Biswas, too, claimed the five did not have any "Trinamool link". BJP candidate and physician Archana said she signed the death certificate as there was "no other doctor available nearby". "Shova Rani was otherwise fine and did not have any critical illness before the attack. She received multiple injuries all over her body," Archana said. BJP national president J P Nadda alleged that Shova Rani "had to die because her son was a BJP worker". The Trinamool responded by saying that the death was a "tragedy" but the response of the country's home minister was "unfortunate". "He heads a police force and multiple central agencies. Shouldn't he show some respect to the investigative process?" party Rajya Sabha leader Derek O'Brien said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/west-bengal/shah-mamata-spar-after-84-yr-old-womans-death/articleshow/81751334.cms||Sanjib Chakrabarty
---||Kolkata||NIA arrests Chhatradhar Mahato for 2009 Rajdhani siege||LALGARH/ KOLKATA: Chhatradhar Mahato, the face of the Maoist-backed tribal movement of 2008-11 in Lalgarh, a former PCPA member and presently a Trinamool Congress state general secretary, was arrested by the National Investigation Agency early on Sunday. Mahato was arrested in connection with the Bhubaneswar Rajdhani siege by alleged Maoist sympathisers in Jhargram’s Banstala on October 27, 2009. NIA’s move came hours after Mahato cast his vote in Lalgarh on Saturday after 11 years. He was later given two days of NIA custody; his next court production is scheduled for March 30. A 40-member NIA team led by officer Kanchan Mitra arrested Mahato from his house at Amlia village. His lawyer, Kaushik Sinha, questioned the need for the night operation. His other lawyer, Mithu Das, said the arrest was against a warrant issued in 2020 and that he was assaulted in custody. The defence’s claim led the court to ask NIA to keep a strict watch on Mahato’s health. His wife Niyati Mahato said NIA officials had snatched their phones. “They barged into our house. He [Chhatradhar] was pushed and brought down from the terrace. When he asked what the matter was, he was asked to step out. They said they’d come from NIA; there were at least 40 people,” she said. BJP has ruled out any politics behind the incident, saying he was a free man till voting in his area ended. The Calcutta High Court had on Thursday exempted Mahato from arrest by NIA in a separate case relating to the murder of a local CPM leader in 2009. The HC had asked Mahato to appear before NIA in its Salt Lake office thrice a week. The HC had barred him from leaving Bengal and set the case again on April 16. Mahato was released from prison in 2020 after having served a 10-year sentence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/nia-arrests-chhatradhar-for-09-rajdhani-siege/articleshow/81750580.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee: Have regressed in agriculture over last 10 years||KOLKATA: Former Bengal chief minister and CPM leader Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who had shelved his plan to set up a chemical hub at Nayachar following the Nandigram carnage in 2007, has appealed to voters — particularly in Singur and Nandigram — to vote against those who took Bengal down the slide in agriculture and industry. “We have gone steps back in agriculture in the last 10 years. There has been no major investment in the industry during this time. Singur and Nandigram are caught in the silence of a graveyard. And those who scripted the evil drama in those days are now busy in mud-slinging,” Bhattacharjee said, without naming Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee and her once-lieutenant-turned-BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari. Bhattacharjee, in his brief appeal, warned against the “authoritarian” Trinamool and the BJP “hand in glove with corporate capital” trying to “divide people on religious lines”. “Both the parties have destroyed democracy extended to the grassroots during the Left Front regime. Even the communal harmony that Bengal used to boast of is at stake,” he added. The former CM appealed to youths demanding jobs to vote for Sanjukta Morcha candidates to “thwart the danger”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/buddha-have-regressed-in-agriculture-over-last-10-years/articleshow/81750522.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Bengal CM links ‘baap-beta’ duo to 2007 Nandigram killings||NANDIGRAM: Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee has accused a “baap-beta” duo of having a hand in the 2007 Nandigram carnage in which 14 people died in police firing. Banerjee did not mention either her Nandigram opponent, Suvendu Adhikari, or his father, Sisir Adhikari, by name but her first attempt to link the Adhikaris to the killings came on Sunday, four days before Nandigram’s voters head for polling stations on Thursday. “How come the police spared the baap-beta in Nandigram? The police could not have entered Nandigram without their consent. They called cops here in 2007. Now they are urging the courts to reopen the 2007 cases against those who resisted land acquisition,” the CM said. She also accused Suvendu — again without naming him — of mobilising “outsiders” to attack her at Birulia Bazar on March 10. “It is he who mobilised ruffians from outside to attack me at Birulia Bazar. No one from Nandigram did it. You harmed me during the election campaign. Now I have to move on a wheelchair,” the CM said on Monday. Suvendu did not respond to the Bengal CM’s Nandigram comments but, instead, raised the communal pitch of his campaign. “Begum is losing. She does not talk to anyone other than Sufian (Sk Sufian) and Rukunuddin. Now I come to hear of another Dawood Ibrahim, Samad. She will create a mini-Pakistan here if she wins,” he said, making an overt appeal on communal lines. Banerjee responded by appealing to communal amity: “They have to divide people on religious lines and spark riots (to win this election). I am not leaving the battlefield. I will fight and win. I believe in Hindu-Muslim-Sikh-Isai apas mein rahna bhai-bhai and want everyone to stay together.” Trinamool supporters mobbed Suvendu and abused him while he was moving out of Asadtala after a public meeting later on Monday evening. Central forces present at the spot rescued and escorted him out in a convoy. Trinamool leaders later claimed their workers were not involved in the incident. Banerjee’s comments, which came 14 years after the Nandigram killings, could have been an attempt to turn public sentiment against the Adhikaris in Nandigram — where the killings remained an emotive issue — felt locals. “They are trying to do a rerun of the Nandigram 2007 carnage when harmads (marauders), in the guise of police, opened fire. They were in khaki but wore chappals. BJP harmads from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar have dressed like the BSF, the CISF, the CRPF this time. They might ask you to vote for the BJP. Mark them out and respond to them with your hata-khunti (ladles and cooking spuds),” she said. Banerjee then recounted how “arrogant and self-seeking” Suvendu was. “I remember the day when Sisirda (his father) became the union minister of state. All the MPs were present at the programme except Suvendu. I asked Sirsirda why Suvendu was absent? Sisirda did not have an answer. I know why he did not come. He wanted to become a minister and even hated his father becoming a minister,” she added. Suvendu shot back at Banerjee, calling her “leg injury” a drama. “She (Mamata) will continue to wear the crepe for some more days till the vote is over,” the BJP candidate said. Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh questioned the Bengal CM’s pre-poll Nandigram version: “What was she doing all these years? She could have ordered an inquiry into the carnage and revealed the truth. She did not do that. Police officers, who opened fire in 2007, were rewarded by the Trinamool government,” he said. Nandigram CPM candidate Minakshi Mukherjee chose not to respond directly to Banerjee’s Sunday and Monday charges against the Adhikaris: “People here know what actually happened on March 14, 2007. It was a conspiracy.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cm-links-baap-beta-duo-to-2007-nandigram-killings/articleshow/81750365.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

The Trinamool responded by saying that the death was a “tragedy” but the response of the country’s home minister was “unfortunate”. “The death is a tragedy.

---||Kolkata||2007 cases force Nandi stir leader to go into hiding||Nandigram: The cases filed by the Left Front government against anti-land acquisition leaders in 2007 are now the BJP’s weapons to neutralise the influence of Bhumi Uchhed Pratirodh Committee (BUPC) on Nandigram election. The resurrection of some cases against 129 accused has made Abu Taher, a key BUPC functionary and Trinamool leader, a fugitive. He fled home after Chhatradhar Mahato was picked up by the NIA. “I don’t want to get arrested before the polls are over. I can at least work while underground. Suvendu-da is hell-bent on getting me arrested because he knows well what I can do,” said Taher, once among the closest aides of Suvendu Adhikari, from the secluded corner of a nondescript farmland. He has been changing his hideout almost on a daily basis. Even a few days ago, Taher — a “Y-category protectee” — was working hard to garner support for Mamata Banerjee across Nandigram. After the cases were revived, he was stripped of his security cover. “I recently fractured my leg, but the pain is nothing compared to that of my physical absence during elections. Didi came to Nandigram and I had to go into hiding,” said Taher, the son of a former schoolteacher. The resurrection of cases shows Adhikari’s desperation, the former aide said. “Last time we met, Suvendu-da asked me to join the BJP. When I declined, he said we must not let our personal relationship sour. But, he did not keep his word,” Taher said. The BUPC functionary has filed a review petition in the Supreme Court, but is unlikely to get a reprieve anytime soon. The next hearing is on April 4. “By that time, polling here will be over (Nandigram votes on April 1),” he said, the resentment in his voice unmistakable. The BJP’s candidate from Nandakumar, Nilanjan Adhikary, recently filed a case in Calcutta High Court against 129 BUPC functionaries. Most of these cases had been withdrawn after Mamata Banerjee took office in 2011.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/2007-cases-force-nandi-stir-leader-to-go-into-hiding/articleshow/81750663.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

The assistant inspector has been arrested in both the threat to industrialist Mukesh Ambani case and the Mansukh Hiran death case. Though he refused to name the leaders, Raut told TV channels he was "around" when discussion on reinstating Waze had taken place and added that "these leaders and some prominent figures" know about it. Waze, suspended for 17 years in the Khwaja Yunus custodial death case, was reinstated by the MVA regime last year. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had, while backing Waze during the session of the state legislature early this month, had asked if Waze was Osama bin Laden. Subsequently, Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamna had in its editorial also backed Waze, saying he and his team had exposed the TRP scam and arrested Arnab Goswami and it was because of that that the Centre had arrested him. Saamna had also stated that Waze's arrest was an insult of the Maharashtra police. Raut is executive editor of Saamna; Uddhav's wife Rashmi Thackeray is the editor. Raut defended Thackeray on Monday and said, "CM Thackeray's statement was based on the information he received at that time, and his stand was correct. However, as Waze's activities have surfaced, there is no reason to shield him. Thackeray was of the opinion that one should not be hanged before an inquiry is conducted." Waze, a suspended assistant police inspector, is currently in NIA custody for placing an explosives-laden vehicle near industrialist Mukesh Ambani's residence. The National Investigation Agency is also investigating the death of vehicle owner Mansukh Hiran who was acquainted with Waze. Raut said, "During my initial days, I have worked as a crime reporter and have been working as a journalist for many years, so I know a few things. But unfortunately, things have happened. Basically, any officer as a person is not bad, but the prevailing situation makes him so." He added, "The whole episode went ahead... no one could have controlled the situation... but the state government and many ministers have learnt a lesson from the incident, and I hope whatever happens, happens for the good."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/had-warned-govt-leaders-against-reinstating-waze/articleshow/81751380.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar

Qureshi, however, said no meeting has been "finalised or requested" so far with his Indian counterpart on the sidelines of the conference. Jaishankar last week did not give a specific reply to questions on if he will meet Qureshi on the sidelines of the conference. The last meeting between Qureshi and an Indian external affairs minister took place in May 2019 in Bishkek on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meeting. The 9th Heart of Asia-Istanbul Process (HoA-IP) ministerial conference is part of the Istanbul Process - a regional initiative on security and cooperation for a stable and peaceful Afghanistan - that was launched on November 2, 2011 in Turkey. During his visit, Jaishanakar is also expected to meet leaders of other participating countries on the sidelines of the conference.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/no-meet-finalised-with-jaishankar-yet-says-pakistan-minister/articleshow/81751429.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Bengal assembly polls 2021: 84.6% turnout in first phase of polling keeps parties on toes||KOLKATA: Bengal recorded a high polling percentage in the first phase of polls. The average polling in the 30 assembly seats was 84.6%, a 2.9% more than it was in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, but a little less than the average 84.7% turnout in the 2011 assembly polls. West Midnapore recorded the highest polling 87.2% followed by East Midnapore (86.3%), Jhargram (84.7%), Bankura (84.3%) and Purulia (81.8%). The average polling was higher than that in the 2016 assembly polls — 81.9%. However, the district-wise polling tally can’t be compared right now with the other elections because many seats in these districts are yet to go for polls. The only difference this time was that the polls were held without reports of major violence unlike in the earlier polls. Poll pundit Biswanath Chakraborty isn’t ready to draw conclusions on the high polling percentage on the grounds that there is no abnormal spurt in voting in the region. Chakraborty said that the high polling doesn’t always reflect a vote against the party in office. “Yes, there was a change in government in 2011. But the polling trend coming up till now is not that significant,” Chakraborty said. The district map in terms of voting percentage has recorded a change compared to the 2016 assembly polls. In 2016, East Midnapore recorded the highest polling 87.7% followed by West Midnapore 86.5%, Bankura 86.5% and Purulia 83.2%. Polling has been low in Purulia this time with the lowest turnouts in Para (79.2%) and Purulia (79.5%) assembly seats. A senior official held that the low polling percentage in Purulia was because of the high temperature and low literacy levels. The highest vote percentage was recorded at West Midnapore’s Garbeta (89.2%) and Salboni (89.4%). Polling percentage in these seats in 2016 assembly polls was 90.5% and 90.4%, respectively. Khejuri in East Midnapore also recorded a high polling percentage of 88.6% as against 89.4% in 2016. The polling percentage in West Midnapore’s Keshiary was 88.5, a little less that the 89.4% polling in 2016. Former IPS officer Nazrul Islam who is now active in politics said: “Election Commission has provisions for scrutiny for seats where polling percentage is above 90%. The EC is playing a proactive role this time by arranging postal ballots for 80-plus category of citizens and even those who have Covid. So a high polling percentage is expected in Bengal.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/84-6-turnout-in-first-phase-of-polling-keeps-parties-on-toes/articleshow/81748854.cms||---

Most of these startups, having registered a rise in profits, is broadening their horizons and taking up new business initiatives. Consider MyHealthBuddy. Its growth rate has reportedly amplified after the implementation of the lockdown as the demand for virtual health coaching increased exponentially. The founder and CEO of the startup, Asheesh Grewal, told TOI, “The year 2020 had been great for us in terms of growth because people, stuck at homes, took to seeking health solutions online. Between December’19 and December’20, our business grew five times. Also, 95% of our clients are women — 70% of them being new mothers.” MyHealthbuddy is not the only one to have raked in profits during the pandemic. Other health startups, TOI spoke to, claimed to have recorded a similar growth trajectory in business. The pandemic has made many people opt for online medical assistance, said Satish Kannan, co-founder and CEO of MediBuddy. “With e-health services becoming the new normal, we saw about a 76% increase in online doctor consultations across various medical departments in Bengal,” he added. Neuberg Diagnostics doubled their revenue this year compared to last year, with people flocking in for Covid tests. A Ganesan, vice chairman of the health startup, said: “The initial three months of the lockdown turned out to be bad for us, as business slumped by 60% to 80%. Subsequently, we made arrangements for RT-PCR testing across six cities. Gradually, our business picked up and grew by almost 20% in all cities between July and December. For Eastern India, we have chalked out a plan to shell out Rs 100 crore in the next two years. Our expansion plans include both organic and inorganic opportunities in Bengal, Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha.” iKure Techsoft has bagged research projects to “expedite their efforts towards fostering growth and collaboration”. The founder and CEO, Sujoy Santra, said: “Though there has been a decrease of 19% in revenue generation in comparison to Q1 and Q2 of the last fiscal 2019-20 due to the pandemic, we have seen a steady 75% rise in revenue against Q1 and Q2 of the financial year 2020-21.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/health-startups-flourish-with-demand-rise-in-online-aid/articleshow/81749524.cms||Sarthak.G

---||Bengaluru||Crack down on healthcare workers refusing shots: Panel||BENGALURU: If healthcare workers (HCWs) refuse to take Covid-19 vaccine, they could have to sign an undertaking declaring that they will take responsibility for the consequences. This is a recommendation made by the Covid technical advisory committee (TAC) to the state government. Nearly 30% of the healthcare workers in the state are yet to receive the doses, and if the government accepts the TAC’s proposal, then healthcare workers will also have to pay for hospitalisation and treatment if they contract the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The government will not bear the costs. “Healthcare workers who are refusing the vaccine are setting the wrong precedent. They are not role models for the public,” said Dr MK Sudarshan, chairperson, TAC. “If they do not take the vaccine, they leave themselves more vulnerable to the disease. For this, they must bear the cost of treatment on their own since they have chosen not to be immunised.” He went on to say, “Nearly 30% of healthcare workers have either refused the vaccine or are hesitant to take it. We have recommended that those who refuse the vaccine be counselled and persuaded to take the shots, especially in view of a surge in cases and increased hospitalisation of those getting infected. If they refuse, they will have to sign a declaration form and submit it to the higher authorities.” There have been concerns raised about the vulnerability of healthcare workers to Covid-19. From January 16 till Sunday (March 28), a total 5,51,786 healthcare workers in Karnataka took the first dose of the vaccine. This is against an estimated 8 lakh healthcare workers in the state. Of the 5.5 lakh healthcare workers who took the first dose, 3.3 lakh have taken the second dose. In Bengaluru, nearly 1.4 lakh healthcare workers have taken the first dose of the vaccine, and 66,531 of them have taken the second dose. Because of their exposure to Covid-19 positive patients, healthcare workers are at the highest risk of infection. However, the TAC is of the view that those healthcare workers who refuse the vaccine, are conveying the wrong message to society. “If they refuse, how will lay persons trust vaccines? Dr Sudarshan said. “It smacks of total irresponsibility. If unvaccinated healthcare workers develop Covid, it amounts to a selfinflicted injury. Why should the government, or even insurance companies pay for this? These workers must bear the expenses.” TAC says healthcare workers who have not taken the vaccine may have also put their family members at risk by not encouraging them to take the vaccine, despite knowing that they are vulnerable. Though taking the vaccine is voluntary, the state health department had hinted that it will crack down on those refusing the vaccine. On February 18, TOI had reported that the government was mulling withdrawing free treatment to those healthcare workers who refused the doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/crack-down-on-healthcare-workers-refusing-shots-panel/articleshow/81751568.cms||Sunitha Rao R
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Again, ministers not on same page in Covid fight||BENGALURU: With the state facing an imminent second wave of Covid infections, the lack of coordination among ministers and contradictory views from those at the helm is not only not helping the fight against the pandemic but is also creating confusion among those on the ground. “The problem of lack of coordination among ministers has returned,” said a senior health department official. “This had hampered Covid management last year too. It appears ministers have not learnt from experience.” Chief minister BS Yedyiurappa appears to be aware of the issue and sources say his office has instructed health minister K Sudhakar and his department not to arbitrarily issue orders relating to containment measures. The bone of contention ahead of a meeting chaired by the CM on Monday to take stock of the pandemic situation in the state was the clash between the health and education departments over conduct of exams. Sudhakar had told reporters on Sunday that students from class 1 to 9 would be promoted without them taking final exams. S Suresh Kumar, education minister, was reportedly taken by surprise by the announcement and his department was flooded with queries from schools and parents. Kumar played down the issue saying, “It was a miscommunication. Sudhakar called me on Monday and said he was misquoted.” Even home minister Basavaraj Bommai was said to be displeased with reported unilateral statements by the health department on possible curbs such as a lockdown and night curfew. The CM’s censure, coupled with his decision to ignore measures recommended by the health department, has reportedly upset Sudhakar. Health department sources say that during the 150-minute meeting the CM chaired on Monday, Sudhakar’s requests for stringent measures fell on deaf ears. For instance, he wanted hostels and educational institutions that don’t have key exams like SSLC or PUC to close for two weeks. “During the meeting, the health minister had said cases could touch 30,000 per day in the absence of curbs,” an official said. Among other things, he also proposed to restrict occupancy in cinema halls to 50%. However, Sudhakar denied accusations of overreach. “Given that children are vulnerable to the infection and can potentially spread it to seniors at home, I only made a request to the education minister to close places where cluster outbreaks can happen. I have not crossed any boundaries.” SR Viswanath, the CM’s political secretary, said the situation is challenging and that different departments have their own priorities. “The health department is responsible for curbing infections and wants strict containment measures, while departments like finance and excise are worried about falling revenues. The CM is taking steps to address these issues,” Viswanath said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-again-ministers-not-on-same-page-in-covid-fight/articleshow/81751559.cms||B V Shiva Shankar
---||India||Sex CD case: Jarkiholi grilled for 4 hrs, his statement taken||BENGALURU: Sleuths from the Special Investigation Team probing the alleged sex-for-job scandal on Monday questioned former minister Ramesh Jarkiholi for over four hours. Jarkiholi and his advocates entered the premises of the Forensic Science Laboratory, Madiwala, in an SUV around 10am. Leaving behind his advocates in the vehicle, Jarkiholi entered the technical wing room. After interacting with the sleuths, Jarkiholi walked out at around 1.30 pm. A letter from the woman who is allegedly seen in a video related to the scandal addressed to the chief justice of the Karnataka high court went viral on social media. "Request to supervise investigation of the matter personally and direct the state government to provide me protection, and kindly render me justice," the letter read. The letter's veracity could not be ascertained. A large contingent of policemen was deployed outside the magistrate's court, Nrupatunga Road, on Monday as the woman's advocate, KN Jagadish, had announced he would bring her to the court to make a statement. However, the woman did not appear. Following rumours that the woman may appear before a judge's residence in Koramangala, a posse of mediapersons and police personnel rushed there. Addressing media persons, Jagadish said, "We have approached the court, seeking permission to produce the woman before the judge for statement. We will bring her here soon." Woman's family blames DKS:Family members of the woman at the centre of the sex CD case, which allegedly involves ex-minister Ramesh Jarkiholi of BJP, claimed on Monday that she was acting under pressure from state Congress president DK Shivakumar. They sought chief minister BS Yediyurappa and home minister Basavaraj Bommai's help to find her and urged courts not to record her statement as she was under duress.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sex-cd-case-jarkiholi-grilled-for-4-hrs-his-statement-taken/articleshow/81751584.cms||---

However, officials have ruled out possibilities of a complete lockdown. TN reported 14 deaths on Monday that took the cumulative death toll to 12,684. The case tally touched 8,81,752.

Prosecutors sought to demonstrate that white then-police officer Derek Chauvin had no justification for using the dangerous move for some nine minutes on Floyd, an African-American man, last May during an arrest on a minor charge. But Chauvin's attorney countered that he would prove that Floyd was on drugs, forcing officers to take tough action, and that his death was caused by the drugs and a medical condition rather than asphyxiation. "Nine minutes and 29 seconds. That's how long that went on," Minnesota state prosecutor Jerry Blackwell said of the amount of time Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck as he lay handcuffed on a Minneapolis street. Floyd was originally arrested on May 25, 2020, for passing a counterfeit $20 bill. But the situation worsened after officers struggled to put him in a police car and instead forced him to the ground, handcuffed. In the video, Floyd moans and gasps for breath while bystanders urge Chauvin to let up. He said, "I can't breathe" 27 times, Blackwell said, before being loaded, unconscious, on a stretcher by medics and taken to hospital, where he was declared dead. Chauvin, a 19-year veteran of the police force, is charged with murder and manslaughter and faces up to 40 years in prison if convicted of the most serious charge -- second-degree murder. But his attorney, Eric Nelson, told the jury of nine women and five men that Chauvin adhered to policing standards. "You will learn that Derek Chauvin did exactly what he had been trained to do," Nelson said. "The evidence will show that Mr. Floyd died of a cardiac arrhythmia that occurred as a result of hypertension, his coronary disease, the ingestion of methamphetamine and fentanyl, and the adrenaline flowing through his body, all of which acted to further compromise already compromised parts," he said. Floyd's death, along with the bystander video of the long minutes that Chauvin held him on the ground, sparked a national outrage, with widespread protests and rioting against police brutality towards African Americans. The trial was broadcast live on television, and the White House said President Joe Biden was paying attention. "He certainly will be watching closely, as Americans across the country will be watching," White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. "At the time of George Floyd's death, he talked about this as being an event that really opened up a wound in the American public." "The whole world is watching," said Ben Crump, a civil rights lawyer and attorney for the Floyd family ahead of opening statements. "Today starts a landmark trial that will be a referendum on how far America has come in its quest for equality and justice for all," Crump said. Chauvin, 44, since fired from the city's police, was seated at the defense table, dressed in a grey suit with a blue shirt and tie. He looked up periodically at the video and jotted down notes on a yellow legal pad. Due to Covid-19 protocols, only one member of Floyd's family was allowed in the courtroom, while others had to watch by video feed in a separate room. Both Blackwell and Nelson sought to play down the broader ramifications of the trial. Blackwell said he was not trying to put all police on trial. "This case is about Mr. Derek Chauvin," he told the jury. "There is no political or social cause in this courtroom," said Nelson. With the first three witnesses, Blackwell appeared to build a case that Chauvin's use of force was extraordinary and dangerous to any observer. The first witness, 911 emergency dispatcher Jena Lee Scurry, said she called another police officer to raise the alarm after watching Chauvin's actions over a closed circuit television feed. Donald Williams, a 33-year-old martial arts instructor who was on the scene, said he told Chauvin at the time that his knee on Floyd's neck was the equivalent of a dangerous "blood choke" used in wrestling and fighting. "You could see him actually trying to gasp for air," he said of Floyd. Crump said Chauvin's defense attorney is "going to try to assassinate the character of George Floyd." "But this is the trial of Derek Chauvin," he said. "The facts are simple. What killed George Floyd was an overdose of excessive force." The trial is expected to last about a month. Three other former police officers involved in the incident- Tou Thao, Thomas Lane, and J. Alexander Kueng- are to be tried separately later this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/jury-in-george-floyd-murder-trial-shown-harrowing-video-of-his-death/articleshow/81751644.cms||---
---||India||Maharashtra: CM Uddhav Thackeray seeks roadmap for second lockdown, NCP & BJP oppose||MUMBAI: Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has directed the administration to draw up a roadmap for a second lockdown, a move that drew opposition from his own alliance partner, NCP, not to mention angry voices in BJP who warned of public protests. A decision may be likely on April 2 after a review. The instructions coincided with the state reporting an all-time high of over 40,000 cases. A day later on Monday, the tally tapered to 31,643. In Mumbai, cases added up to over 12,000 in the last 48 hours. The 'lockdown' plan does not have enough takers among politicians, who worry about a public backlash. Experts tracking the pandemic's progress though are in favour of rolling back relaxations in movement as well as trade and commerce. Read AlsoPrepare for lockdown, Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray tells chief secretary as Covid cases hit new highAlarmed at Maharashtra recording its highest single-day tally of 40,414 new Covid-19 cases on Sunday, CM Uddhav Thackeray went into a huddle with the state task force and asked chief secretary Sitaram Kunte to immediately draw up a strategy for the “last resort” of a lockdown."Most cabinet members are against a lockdown. In the first lockdown people suffered, a large number lost their jobs and the economy collapsed," said NCP spokesperson and state minister Nawab Malik. Within Shiv Sena there is no consensus on the issue, but NCP has been vocal in its opposition. In a meeting of public health officials and the state's Covid-19 taskforce with Thackeray over the weekend, the CM said a Standard Operating Procedure must be kept ready to guide the state in the event another lockdown became necessary. He said restrictions and rules issued are not being followed by the public, adding health facilities added may not suffice in the event of a sharp surge. Thackeray said a SoP should be put in place to ensure essential services, including supply of foodgrains, medicines, and medical services, are not hamstrung if a lockdown is imposed. Senior officials said a review of the situation is likely on April 2 and a decision could be taken then. Read Also'Asked CM to consider other options': NCP's Malik as Maharashtra govt mulls lockdownA day after Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray asked officials to "prepare for a lockdown", senior NCP leader Nawab Malik on Monday said that leaders in the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government have asked him to "consider other options".Cases in Maharashtra have risen exponentially in the last fortnight, with 3.9 lakh people testing positive. Between March 1 and March 28, over 5.4 lakh cases were detected, almost as much as in September 2020, the worst month in terms of Covid19 tallies. At present, the weekly positivity rate in Maharashtra is the highest in the country at 22.78%; the state conducts 1.5 lakh tests daily. Explaining the current Covid-19 situation and facilities available to tackle it, Pradeep Vyas, principal secretary, public health, said infections are shooting up, coursing rapidly through the population. Key facilities, especially beds, ventilators and oxygen supply, would soon turn scarce. Members of the taskforce pointed out that if cases continue to spread, the death toll could also increase and this could be due to delay in hospitalization and testing as well as non-compliance with rules while in home isolation. "Lockdown is the last resort, but we have to consider it because the healthcare infrastructure is crumbling. There are no beds available in the private sector and public-sector beds too are getting filled fast," said task force member Dr Shashank Joshi who was part of Sunday's meeting.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); However, Sena MP and party leader Sanjay Raut said he had spoken to Thackeray and suggested that rather than a lockdown which will be very damaging to the economy, more curbs could be imposed. "I am not in favour of a complete lockdown. The working class, businesses and the economic cycle will be affected. I spoke to the CM and he too is of the same view," said Raut. Malik of the NCP said instead of a second lockdown, all out efforts should be made to strengthen health infrastructure, boost vaccinations and enforce Covid-appropriate behaviour. "Vigilance is very poor. As a result, people are roaming on roads without masks. Responsibility must be fixed on ward officers," he said. The opposition warned of protests if a lockdown is imposed. "It will hit the poor hard," said BJP state president Chandrakant Patil. He demanded that the government declare a package of Rs 5,000 for daily wagers who will be impacted by the lockdown. Chief Secretary Sitaram Kunte said the pace of vaccination was satisfactory though the Centre has suggested speeding it up in areas where incidence of infection was high. Efforts are being made for it, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/maharashtra-cm-seeks-roadmap-for-second-lockdown-ncp-bjp-oppose/articleshow/81751246.cms||---

The officer at BB Nagar, in two separate letters dated March 26, informed PDP president Mehbooba Mufti and her mother that their passports were refused owing to the "adverse CID report", which is required under the provisions of the Passport Act, 1967. Gulshan Nazir also received the same letter. However, it says the women can appeal against the decision at a higher forum provided by the MEA. Mehbooba and her mother had applied for a renewal of their passports after its expiry in May last year, in December. However, she did not get her passport till March 2021, after which she she approached the J&K high court. Mehbooba said this shows the level of normalcy achieved in Kashmir. She tweeted, "Passport Office refused to issue my passport based on CID's report citing it is 'detrimental' to the security of India. This is the level of normalcy achieved in Kashmir since Aug 2019 that an ex-CM holding a passport is a threat to the sovereignty of a mighty nation." She released the passport office letters sent to her. The J&K high court heard the petition on March 23, wherein additional solicitor General T M Shamsi, representing the MEA and the passport office, sought a short adjournment after the counsel representing the J&K CID informed Justice Ali Mohammed Magrey that the verification report on Mehbooba's passport application had been submitted on March 18. However, Shamsi informed the court that he had received a communication from the passport officer in Srinagar on March 22 and the contents "reveal that the verification of the petitioner is under process and as soon as the process is completed, the requisite report will be submitted immediately for further course of action". "Communication further reveals that CID verification report in respect of the petitioner is still awaited from the JK CID," Justice Magrey said. HC dismisses Mehbooba's plea:The Jammu and Kashmir HC on Monday dismissed the petition by PDP chief and former CM Mehbooba Mufti, seeking its directions for issuance of the passport.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mehbooba-her-mother-denied-passport-owing-to-cid-report/articleshow/81751714.cms||M Saleem Pandit

He said Kushbu was a talented actress, good orator and politician and if people voted for her, she would bring development to the constituency. She can take up the needs of the constituency with the central government and get them sanctioned, he said. People should vote for lotus for the state to flourish and grow, he said and listed out various schemes like metro rail being implemented in the state with financial assistance from the Centre. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was working hard for making India a powerful country, he said. EPS also campaigned for AIADMK candidates in Mylapore, T Nagar, Saidapet and Anna Nagar. Sharpening his attack on DMK leader M K Stalin, EPS said as Chennai mayor, deputy CM and minister for local administration and rural development, he had done nothing for the development of Chennai city. He also lashed out at Stalin for encouraging his party leaders to talk ill about women. “He is not fit to be leader of a party,” said EPS. Reacting to Stalin wishing him long life, EPS said he had the blessings of God and did not want the DMK leader’s blessings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/cordial-ties-with-centre-must-for-states-dvpt-tamil-nadu-cm-edappadi-k-palaniswami/articleshow/81751725.cms||---

The hospital has reported it as a serious adverse event after immunisation (AEFI). The South Bengaluru resident had no comorbidities but developed a fever and walking imbalance after taking the shot. He collapsed in his home on March 13 and was admitted to Apollo Hospitals, Bannerghatta Road. Doctors say his platelet count had fallen to just 20,000 (normal 1.5 to 2 lakh) but since he tested negative for Covid and all other inflammatory markers were ruled out, he was discharged on March 23 after platelet transfusion and other treatment. However, the man was readmitted on March 25 with complaints of garbled speech and signs of a brain bleed. “He is deeply comatose,” said Dr Yatheesh Govindaiah, unit head, Apollo Hospitals, Jayanagar, where the man had taken the dose. A team of neurologists and haematologists is treating the patient currently. Representatives from the state committee for AEFI met the patient, treating doctors and the family on Monday. Dr Gurucharan Adoor, neurologist, Apollo Hospitals, Bannerghatta Road, who is now treating the senior citizen, said the platelet count has improved to 1.1 lakh. “The hospital has reported it as serious AEFI, but it needs further investigation,” Dr Adoor said. “He is showing some signs of improvement, but it is too early to say. We are running a few tests on him. He suffered intracranial bleeding and he had no comorbidities earlier.” He said a meeting had been called to discuss whether the man’s condition was triggered by the vaccine. He added that no such cases have been reported at his hospital so far. “Having said that, we should not discourage people from taking the vaccine,” Dr Adoor said. “We have to be sure whether this case is related to the vaccine or not. This will be dealt with by the government.” When contacted, Dr BN Rajani, state deputy director for immunisation, said the district AEFI committee will meet on Tuesday and discuss the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-80-year-old-man-suffers-adverse-event-in-coma/articleshow/81751701.cms||Sunitha Rao R

The association says all their syllabi have been completed through online medium and there is nothing more they need to do. D Shashi Kumar, secretary of the association, said: “It’s the usual time of the year when we end our activities. Since most of our schools were able to deliver lessons online, all academic activities have been completed. Also, this is the time teachers travel to their hometowns. The weather too makes it hard to work.” Many schools in Bengaluru are seeing a fall in attendance amid rising fears of a second wave of infections. Some of them have also rolled back lower classes that began days ago. “We had reopened for classes 8 upwards but a week back, we rolled back grades 8 and 9 into online mode,” said Mansoor Ali Khan, board of members, Delhi Public Schools. “There has been a dip of 30% in the other classes,” Tejaswi Ballari, principal, Poornaprajna Education Centre, Sree Krishna Nagar, said: “We had 75-85 students coming to class. It has fallen by 50% now. Parents are scared to send their children as numbers are spiking. We have both online and offline classes happening simultaneously, so it is not a problem for students.” Schools say going back to online mode is not hard as they now have the experience. “While we haven’t seen a change in attendance as pre-boards are happening now, we’re taking each day as it comes,” said Shylini Soans, principal, Newage World School. “Going back online is not difficult. We were hoping things would get better and we could at least see our primary section students for a month, but the second wave has come as a rude shock,” Many schools also expressed the need to have exams. “Last year too, there were no exams and children were promoted without a test. This year, we are not even sure how much of learning has happened. Online tests were not effective as students either copied or parents helped them. We would not want the government to call it off,” said principal of a school in east Bengaluru.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/with-attendance-falling-many-schools-revert-to-online-classes-in-karnataka/articleshow/81751607.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas

Minorities would not buy the ruling party’s argument that it was a defender of their rights, he said. Addressing voters at Jolarpet, Stalin said the AIADMK’s promise to repeal CAA was an election drama. “The CAA would not have been passed if the AIADMK and the PMK members in the Parliament had voted against it,” he said.

---||World||Suez blockade ends as moon & tides cut 'Ever Given' free||The mammoth cargo ship blocking one of the world's most vital maritime arteries was wrenched from the shoreline and finally set free Monday, raising hopes that traffic could soon resume in the Suez Canal and limit the economic fallout of the disruption. Salvage teams, working on land and water for five days and nights, were ultimately assisted by forces more powerful than any machine rushed to the scene: the moon and the tides. The ship was ultimately set free at around 3pm, according to shipping officials. Horns blared in celebration as images emerged on social media of the once stuck ship on the move. But just as the tides rose and fell, optimism waxed and waned throughout the day Monday as each bit of encouraging news was met with words of caution. The stern, or the back of the ship, was clearly free from the land early Monday. But for hours until the ship was finally freed, it had remained uncertain if the ship's bow had been truly pulled from the mud and muck on the banks of the canal. Salvage crews had worked around a schedule largely dictated by the tides: working to make progress during the six hours it would take for the water to go from low point to high and then back again. With a full moon Sunday, the following 24 hours had offered the best window to work, with a few extra inches of tidal flow providing a vital assist for their efforts. Throughout the night Sunday and into Monday, tugboats worked in coordination with dredgers to return the 220,000-ton vessel to the water. Then, just before dawn, the ship slowly regained buoyancy. It was a turning point in one of the largest and most intense salvage operations in modern history, with the smooth functioning of the global trading system hanging in the balance. The army of machine operators, engineers, tugboat captains and other salvage operators knew they were in a race against time. Each day of blockage put global supply chains another day closer to a full-blown crisis. Vessels packed with the world's goods - including cars, oil, livestock and laptops - usually flow through the canal with ease, supplying much of the globe as they traverse the quickest path from Asia and the Middle East to Europe and the East Coast of the United States. With concerns that the salvage operation could take weeks, some ships decided not to wait, turning to take the long way around the southern tip of Africa, a voyage that can add weeks to the journey and more than $26,000 a day in fuel costs. Each bit of progress in moving the ship over the weekend was celebrated by the workers on the canal - tugboat horns blaring and shouts of joy often echoing in the desert dark. Late Saturday, tugboat drivers sounded off in celebration of what was up to that point the most visible sign of progress since the Ever Given ran aground late Tuesday. The 1,300-foot ship moved. It did not go far - just two degrees, or about 100 feet, according to officials. But that came on top of progress from Friday, when officials said dredgers had managed to dig out the rear of the ship, freeing its rudder.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/suez-blockade-ends-as-moon-tides-cut-ever-given-free/articleshow/81751809.cms||---

Police said Tarun and his mother Baby, 37, of Mariamman Koil Street in West Tambaram, were going to Vallakottai Murugan temple in view of Panguni Uthiram festival on Sunday. There were at least 20 others walking near the mother-son duo when the accident occurred. When the group reached Karanithangal on Vandalur-Wallajahbad Road, a speeding private bus belonging to a company hit the two from behind. While Tarun died on the spot, Baby sustained severe head injuries. Passersby rescued the woman and rushed her to a private hospital. Tarun was declared brought dead.  The woman was later shifted to a government hospital in Chengalpet for further treatment.  Tarun's body was sent for a postmortem to the same hospital. Police said that Tarun suffered a deep head injury leading to his death. He also came under the rear wheels of the vehicle. Witnesses said that they did not hear any horn and notice that a bus coming. There were a few earth movers parked along the road. Police believed the driver of the bus must have dozed off. However, he told police that he failed to notice the two as it was pitch dark in the area. The Oragadam police have registered a case of causing death due to negligence and are yet to arrest the driver. A road widening work is on on the 16-km stretch between Oragadam and Wallajahbad to make it a six-lane highway to cater to the increasing vehicular movement on the Oragadam industrial corridor and ease congestion between Chennai and Kancheepuram stretch via Wallajabad. Due to this, the traffic was moving slowly on the stretch. Police said that drivers of heavy vehicles speed on the stretch without bothering about pedestrians.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-boy-7-killed-mother-injured-as-private-bus-runs-over-pilgrims/articleshow/81751844.cms||---

Ulsoor Gate police arrested two suspects on March 23 and another on March 26 based on a complaint filed by Harish HM, assistant commissioner of police, CAR headquarters, who was part of the document verification process. The arrests come days after Parappana Agrahara and Madiwala police arrested three constables for allegedly getting others to impersonate them during the physical fitness test in Karnataka State Reserve Police recruitment process. The fraud in the city police recruitment came to the fore during document verification. Kasappa Emminavar, 25, from Jamakhandi, Bagalkot, had appeared for verification on March 23. The officials found that the photographs in the admission ticket and the candidate who had appeared for the verification were not matching. When questioned, Emminavar said he had appeared for a physical test and his cousin Kashinath Telsingh had taken the written exam. Efforts are on to nab Telsingh. On March 23, police arrested Basavaraja Honakuppa, 22, of Gokak. Honakuppa had cleared his written examination and his friend Sourabh had appeared for physical exam and cleared the test on behalf of him. Search is on for Sourabh. In the third case, Ulsoor Gate police arrested Yallappa Harijan Ashok, 25, of Gokak on March 26, when he came for document verification. Ashok confessed to have cleared his physical test, but his friend Ningappa Bagi wrote exam on his behalf. Bagi is absconding. Fake markscard Raju Bharamappa Harijan, 22, from Gokak had applied for the post of constable by furnishing fake markscard. Vidhana Soudha police registered a cheating case against him on March 25. Govindaraju C, official from the city police commissioner's office, has filed the complaint against Harijan. Harijan had furnished markscards of National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) and the deputy director of NIOS found them to be fake.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/three-job-aspirants-held-for-impersonation-in-bengaluru/articleshow/81751952.cms||Santosh kumar.B

The vaccination drive under the Biden administration has been going in at an unprecedented pace. As many as 100 million shots have been administered in less than 60 days of his administration and they are now moving on to the next 100 million shots in just 40 days. "I'm pleased to announce that at least 90 per cent of all adults in this country will be eligible to be vaccinated by April the 19th, just three weeks from now, because we have the vaccines," Biden told reporters at the White House on Monday. "For the vast, vast majority of adults, you won't have to wait until May 1. You'll be eligible for your shot on April 19th. Finally, the final 10 per cent will be eligible no later than May 1," he said. "Due to the steps we're taking today, 90 per cent of Americans will be within five miles of a location where they can get a shot as of April the 19th." "The progress we're making is a significant testament to what we can do when we work together as Americans. But as I've always said, we still need everyone to do their part. We still are in a war with this deadly virus. And we're bolstering our defenses, but this war is far from won," Biden said. According to Biden, the progress on vaccination is a stunning example that there is nothing this country cannot do if "we put their minds to it". Biden said just 10 weeks after he became the president, nearly 75% of Americans over the age of 65 had received at least one vaccination shot. "When I took office on January 20th, that number was 8 per cent. It's going to 75 per cent. That's a lot of grandparents who are now able to safely hug their grandchildren and they couldn't do so just a short time ago," he said. The president also directed officials to ensure there is a vaccine site within five miles of 90 per cent of all Americans by April 19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/90-us-adults-to-be-eligible-for-vaccine-by-april-19-biden/articleshow/81751965.cms||---

"In last 4 days Bangalore's weather took a turn for the worst & is now it's suddenly extremely hot & dry. Aur ussi ke sath sath heat boils bhi shuru ho gaye hai (now heat boils have started with the rising temperature)," Pradnya tweeted. Responded to a tweet about summers in Mumbai, Usha Iyer tweeted: "Bangalore is no less. Have constant heat headaches." The heat coupled with Covid scare has dampened the Holi spirits of many residents. Rachna Parmar, nutritionist and health coach, tweeted: "This is one Holi when I made nothing special. The heat and the rising Covid cases is driving me nuts." The bigger worry on Bengalureans' mind was that the months ahead could only get hotter and power cuts and water shortage could make worsen things. Ramakrishna Pandith tweeted: "We can feel the heat now. It's just about March, next 2-3 months would be burning hot."  The soaring heat has perplexed Bengalureans who reminisced wearing monkey caps and sweaters during March-April. Mahesh Kumar, a designer, said he cannot imagine this is the same city where he wore a sweater to school all around the year. "I used to wear a monkey cap to school in the morning. I remember the exam months around March would be pleasant with chilly mornings. This heat is scary," he said. Several Twitterati attributed this to indiscriminate cutting of trees. "About 10 years ago, there was no such thing as heat in Bangalore. Due to extreme tree felling and dried-up ponds, it's become hot. They must make Bangalore green again, and restore ponds," Prestige tweeted. Netizens like Priloza began second-guessing decisions to move to Bengaluru for the weather. "Feeling the heat. Who else moved here for 'the weather?" she tweeted. Ruchi Singh, a techie, told TOI that she had moved to the city 10 years ago from Delhi, hoping to bid adieu to scorching summers. "We never thought about installing an air conditioner," Singh said. People also raised concern about cabs unwilling to switch on the AC and the lack of tinted glasses turning cars into 'ovens on wheels.' Jeba tweeted: "So 8 years back, courts decided to ban tinted glasses and sun films due to illegal activities. It is 2021 now, how much of the crimes have reduced due to this? Only the travellers are suffering from heat and burning millions in AC fuel."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/netizens-feel-bengaluru-too-hot-to-handle-now/articleshow/81751975.cms||Farheen Hussain
---||Business||Opec+ to reconvene to navigate crude market volatility||LONDON: The Opec+ grouping of oil producers will hold its third ministerial summit of the year via videoconference Thursday to discuss output cuts in the face of fresh price volatility. "The expectation is that the group will hold production steady also in May given current physical oil market weakness," according to Bjarne Schieldrop, analyst at SEB. However, he added that "Russia and Kazakhstan are likely to lift production yet another notch and the group in total is probably fine with that." The Opec cartel's largest producer is Saudi Arabia but the Opec+ grouping also includes Russia, which produces even more crude oil. Under its current agreement the Opec+ group is enforcing a drastic output cut, meaning seven million barrels that could be shipped to markets every day are being left in the ground. The aim has been to avoid oversupplying a market suffering from a collapse in demand due to the coronavirus pandemic. Without the production cuts, limited storage capacity could be saturated and the danger of a fall in prices -- currently hovering around $60 per barrel -- is real. Indeed, the two benchmark contracts, American WTI and Europe's Brent, have undergone a drastic price correction in recent weeks and have been subjected to fresh price instability over the last few days, a sign of serious market tension. At the beginning of the year the arrival of effective coronavirus vaccines had led to hopes that widespread lockdowns, and with them the collapse in demand that has been a nightmare for the cartel, might soon be over. But then came the third wave surge in Europe and the spread of the virus in key crude consumer markets such as India and Brazil. "Oil demand trends are not only pressured by renewed lockdowns on the (European) continent but also chaos with its vaccination program," said Stephen Brennock, analyst at PVM. The International Energy Agency (IEA) reflected this more downbeat outlook in forecasts contained in its last report this month. It estimated that global demand could take another two years to get back to its pre-crisis levels. Despite different opinions on how to manage fallout from the crisis, Opec+ has been able to unite around a very cautious policy of slow increase in capacity based on "prudence", a watchword of Saudi energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman. To help smaller producers, Saudi Arabia agreed to reduce its own output by an extra million barrels per day (bpd) in February, March and April. However this cut "was never going to last forever and traders are now getting increasingly worried that the kingdom will not hold on to it for much longer" says Louise Dickson of Rystad. As such Riyadh's moves at this week's meeting will be especially keenly watched. Faced with a constantly shifting market, the Opec+ states have agreed to an almost monthly rhythm of meetings to thrash out policy for the month to follow, rather than the twice-yearly meetings which were the norm before the pandemic. Once again the thorny subject of respect for production cut quotas will be hanging over the meeting, as well the issue of the three producers who have thus far been exempted from cuts -- Venezuela, Libya and Iran. On Wednesday the group will hold preliminary discussions in the form of its Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC), which is tasked with overseeing implementation of agreements.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/opec-to-reconvene-to-navigate-crude-market-volatility/articleshow/81751995.cms||---

The appointment marks yet another departure for the Koraneshwara mutt, affiliated to the Sri Jagadguru Murugharajendra Mutt of Chitradurga, which draws lakhs of followers from Karnataka and neighbouring states. In February last year, a Muslim youth was appointed head of the Lingayat mutt branch in Asuti in Gadag district. Mutt pontiff Murugharajendra Koraneshwar Shivayogi, 61, told TOI that seers used to appoint one of their relatives as their successor but the practice has been shunned in recent years. "We made a court decree in 2018 so that none of my relatives could claim the successorship. However, swamijis continue to appoint a man belonging to the Jangama caste as their successor. Since we believe in Basava's principles of equality, we have decided to appoint Neelalochana Taayi, who belongs to Jangama Goudru caste," he said. Will work for harmony, says woman pontiffIt is an honour for me,” said Neelalochana Taayi. “I have been trained by Murugha Sharanaru of Chitradurga Mutt and Murugharajendra Shivayogi. As I know Marathi and Kannada, I will try to spread linguistic harmony between Kannadigas and Marathispeaking people in the region.” Neelalochana Taayi was administered Linga Deeksha in 1997-98. “She has pursued sadhaka, bodhaka and ‘sudharaka training at Chitradurga. As she pursued her primary and high school education in Marathi medium, she was sent to the Chitradurga Mutt between 2001 and 2005 to learn Kannada . She has also been looking after Nijacharana Kannada Medium School,” the pontiff said. “Seeing her dedication and social service, we have chosen her as head. With this, we have upheld the principles of gender equality and social justice propagated by Basavanna and other Sharanas of the 12th century.” Neelalochana Taayi is youngest child of Mathurabai and Hanamuntappa Nagare of Khajuri village. Her two brothers are farmers while her sisters are married and settled in Maharashtra. She studied up to Class 10 in Marathi medium in Murum village of Umarga taluk in Maharashtra and has trained around 20 women in animal husbandry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/one-year-after-picking-muslim-as-pontiff-lingayat-mutt-gives-reins-to-woman/articleshow/81752011.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai
---||World||North Korean leader's sister slams South's Moon as US 'parrot'||SEOUL: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's influential sister slammed the South's president Tuesday as "a parrot raised by America" after he criticised a missile test by Pyongyang. The nuclear-armed North has a long history of using weapons tests to ramp up tensions, and last week carried out its first substantive provocation since US President Joe Biden's inauguration. The US and Japan said the weapons fired were ballistic missiles -- banned under a UN Security Council resolution -- while Pyongyang insisted they were tactical guided weapons. South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who has long backed engagement with Pyongyang, made a carefully measured speech on Friday -- when the South marked three deadly attacks by the North since 1999 -- that did not specifically refer to the missile test. Actions that stand in the way of resuming dialogue between Pyongyang and Washington were "undesirable", he said. His speech prompted denunciation from Pyongyang, with Kim Yo Jong, a key adviser to her brother, calling it the "height of effrontery". She had been "struck speechless", she said in a statement carried by the official KCNA news agency, referring to Moon only as the South's "chief executive" and not by his name or title. Calling him "a parrot raised by America", she said he was employing "the gangster-like logic of the US". It is a far cry from the diplomacy of 2018, when Moon visited Pyongyang and gave a speech to a vast crowd in the May Day Stadium, where at one point an image of him and Kim Jong Un was displayed across a grandstand. The Biden administration is in the final stages of a review on policy towards the North, and the new US president has repeatedly said he will look to rebuild the alliances with partners such as South Korea that suffered under his predecessor Donald Trump. Biden has warned the North that "there will be responses if they choose to escalate" testing. He left the door open for further diplomacy, but the White House said Monday a summit between him and Kim was "not his intention". European members of the UN Security Council have asked for a meeting Tuesday to discuss the launch.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/north-korean-leaders-sister-slams-souths-moon-as-us-parrot/articleshow/81751982.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||RT-PCR false negatives: Doctors say syndromic approach needed||BENGALURU: Doctors say a new pattern to the pandemic is emerging in Bengaluru: Infected people who are symptomatic are testing negative in RTPCR tests but are eventually landing up in hospitals with serious breathing-related difficulties. Because of the falsenegative RT-PCR reports, doctors are at their wits’ end since families are refusing to admit kin citing test reports. Usually, when a person exhibits symptoms and the RT-PCR report is negative, hospitals take a scan of the lungs using high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT). A unique Covid-19 reporting and data (CORAD) score is attributed to such cases. If the CORAD score is 6 (very high) it’s declared a Covid case. “A person’s condition might worsen if families delay treatment,” doctors said while pointing to the case of a 52-year-old man, who had Covid symptoms since March 12, but his RTPCR report showed he was negative. The family sought medical help only when the man began having breathing difficulties. He was admitted to Sarojini Health Centre near Nagasandra on March 18 and continues to remain in hospital. “He needs 5-6 litres of oxygen,” said Dr Chethan Kumar NG, pulmonologist, Sarojini Health Centre. “What is important is to begin a syndromic approach to treat Covid cases and not rely only on test reports.” Dr Chethan has drawn up a flowchart on the syndromic approach which has been widely circulated in the medical community. “The sensitivity of RTPCR tests is only 70% and a lot depends on other factors such as the way swab samples were collected and stored,” Dr Chethan said. “If we continue to rely only on RT-PCR tests, many infected people who need treatment may slip through. When there is a delay, the viral load increases in the body resulting in cytokine storm and lung fibrosis.” Awareness needed After a significant number of false negative reports last year, the government issued a circular on October 25 stating these cases must be correlated with clinical features, CT thorax findings and laboratory investigations. “If the clinical assessment and CT thorax findings correlate, then such cases will be considered as a proxy syndrome, ‘Covid-19 like illness’ or ‘Covid-19 probable case’,” the circular read. But doctors say awareness is needed among the public as many patients leave hospitals against medical advice. For example, a senior citizen from Tumakuru walked into Fortis hospital with Covid symptoms. An RT-PCR test in another hospital showed he was negative but his oxygen saturation level was dropping, and he was finding it difficult to breathe. “A rapid antigen test was positive,” said Dr Sudha Menon, director, internal medicine, Fortis hospital, Bannerghatta Road. “He argued that he had two contrasting reports and left the hospital against medical advice.” Doctors say the government must fix the awareness issue. Dr Ravindra Mehta, chief of pulmonary, critical care and interventional pulmonology, Apollo specialty hospitals, said: “Compared to a year ago, awareness has increased,” Dr Mehta said. “But it depends on the families we deal with and their background. Most educated families understand this.” Dr Vasunetra Kasargod, consultant chest physician, Vikram Hospital, said patients’ families are not wrong in asking questions about the RT-PCR negative reports and facts must be explained to them. Dr Chethan said: “Although there is a government order, patients who are RT-PCR negative but show high CORAD scores are not given a Covid patient number (P number). This needs to be fixed. P numbers will clear confusion.” However, KV Trilok Chandra, commissioner, health and family welfare department, said the government has already released guidelines on syndromic approach. “If there is still lack of awareness, we will address the matter,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/rt-pcr-false-negatives-doctors-say-syndromic-approach-needed/articleshow/81751950.cms||Sunitha Rao R

Water levels of major reservoirs and groundwater stocks have started to dip before peak summer, and this has prompted fears of an impending water crisis. According to the rural development and panchayat raj (RDPR) department, Chikkaballapur, Kolar, Tumakuru and Bengaluru Urban and Rural districts are suffering drinking water problems. About 20 villages in these districts are getting tanker water and in around 100 villages, local authorities are tapping private borewells. “The problem has just started and the department is taking all measures to tackle the situation by supplying water through tankers, digging new borewells and hiring private ones. As of now, the situation is not alarming anywhere,” said LK Ateeq, principal secretary, RDPR. He said that the department had already released Rs 68 crore to districts to solve water problems. The North Karnataka region is usually the first to report shortages during summer. This time, there have been no major complaints. Locals say good rains in the past few years have benefited the region. “Because of backto-back floods, most lakes, tanks and wells have sufficient water. The floods also helped recharge groundwater,” said Basappa, a farmer in Bagalkot district. RDPR minister KS Eshwarappa reviewed the drinking water situation on Monday and directed officials to address problems on priority. He said constituencies facing droughts for two and three consecutive years would be given Rs 35 lakh and Rs 50 lakh, respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/parts-of-karnataka-suffer-water-woes-just-weeks-into-summer/articleshow/81752084.cms||Anil Gejji

A fire that started near Schroeder Road in the Nemo area, about 24 kilometres northwest of Rapid City, had burned as much as 11/2 square miles and was "still moving" on Monday afternoon, according to the Pennington County sheriff's office. Several outbuildings and possibly two homes have been destroyed, officials said. South Dakota governor Kristi Noem, who travelled to Rapid City to oversee the response, said the Schroeder Road fire started on private property. She said "there have been losses and that is tragic". No injuries have been reported. The sheriff's department warned earlier that it was a "very active and dangerous scene." About 250 firefighters were battling the blaze on a windy afternoon when gusts have ranged from around 50 mph to 72 mph, the Rapid City Journal reported. Two additional blazes were burning southwest of Rapid City, near Keystone, with one covering an estimated 75 acres (30.35 hectares) and the other 20 acres (8.09 hectares). That has caused Mount Rushmore National Memorial to close, as well as surrounding roads. South Dakota transportation officials shut down a 68-kilometre stretch Interstate 90 from Kadoka to Murdo for three hours due to grass fires.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/400-homes-evacuated-rushmore-closed-amid-south-dakota-fires/articleshow/81752053.cms||---

He alleged that Trudeau has turned Canada into a "running dog of the United States". "Boy, your greatest achievement is to have ruined the friendly relations between China and Canada, and have turned Canada into a running dog of the US. Spendthrift!!!" Li Yang tweeted on Sunday. This comes a day after China had announced sanctions against two American religious-rights officials and a Canadian MP in response to western countries' sanctions on Beijing over the issue of human rights abuses in Xinjiang province. Those targeted by the new sanctions by China include Gayle Manchin, chairwoman of the US Commission on International Religious Freedom, and its vice-chairman Tony Perkins; Canadian MP Michael Chong and members of the Canadian Commons subcommittee on international human rights, South China Morning Post reported. However, the United States condemned China's sanctions and said that Beijing's attempt to silence criticism of human rights abuse in Xinjiang invites international scrutiny. Taking to Twitter, secretary of state Antony Blinken said, "We condemn the People's Republic of China's sanctions on two members of the independent and bipartisan @USCIRF (US Commission on International Religious Freedom). Beijing's attempt to silence criticism of serious human rights abuse in Xinjiang only contributes to growing international scrutiny." Recently in a press briefing, Trudeau slammed China's treatment of two of its nationals there, saying it threatens both 'respect for the rule of law' and Beijing's relationships with Western nations. "China needs to understand that it is not just about two Canadians. It is about the respect for the rule of law and relationships with a broad range of Western countries that is at play with the arbitrary detention and the coercive diplomacy they have engaged in," said Trudeau.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/chinese-official-slams-trudeau-calls-canada-running-dog-of-us/articleshow/81752114.cms||---

But the report, drafted by World Health Organization (WHO) -appointed international experts and their Chinese counterparts, offers no definitive answers on how the new coronavirus jumped to humans. AFP obtained a copy of the final report ahead of its official publication on Tuesday. WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the international experts would hold a press conference Tuesday at 1400 GMT to discuss their findings, adding that all hypotheses on the pandemic's origins remained open and needed further study. Covid-19 has killed more than 2.7 million people worldwide in the 15 months since it emerged, forcing governments around the world to introduce restrictions that have battered the global economy. Ahead of a meeting with world leaders, UN chief Antonio Guterres called Monday for more debt relief for the poorest countries struggling with economic fallout from the pandemic. In the United States, there was good news about progress of its vaccine roll-out, but President Joe Biden warned Americans the battle was far from over. Mexico, meanwhile, released new figures on excess deaths that suggest its official coronavirus death toll -- already the third-highest in the world -- is a massive underestimate. The expert report on the origins of Covid-19 has had a troubled birth, with publication delays adding to the hold-ups and diplomatic wrangling that plagued the WHO's attempts to get experts into Wuhan -- the city at the center of the initial outbreak. They finally arrived on January 14, more than a year after the first cases surfaced. Experts believe the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes the Covid-19 disease originally came from bats. The report authors judged that the most likely scenario was that it had made a direct leap to humans, while not ruling out other theories. Beijing's theory that the virus did not originate in China at all but was imported in frozen food was judged "possible" but very unlikely. Claims promoted by former US president Donald Trump's administration that the virus escaped from a research lab were judged "extremely unlikely." Meanwhile, UN chief Guterres called for a "new debt mechanism" allowing such options as debt swaps, buy-backs and cancellations to help worse-off countries. Addressing an online forum that included dozens of world leaders, he said the pandemic has pushed the world to "the verge of a debt crisis" and required "urgent action." "We need to change the rules," he argued. The pandemic had also "shattered the lives" of millions of women and girls and reversed progress towards gender equality, he said. In the US, the White House said that 90 percent of adults would be eligible for Covid-19 shots within three weeks. But in a television address, Biden warned the country -- which has the world's highest death toll -- that "our work is far from over. The war against Covid-19 is far from won." He condemned the reckless behavior of some people flouting social distancing measures. New government data from Mexico showed that it had registered 294,287 Covid-19 deaths -- substantially more than previously recorded, and the third-highest in the world behind Brazil and the United States. In Britain on Monday, people rushed to pools and parks to enjoy new-found freedoms, as the government allowed small groups to gather and sports activities to resume. "We haven't swum since January 5, so we were beyond excited to come back and get back into the water," said swimmer Jessica Walker a London pool. The country is also lining up an FA Cup semi-final football match in April as a test run for reopening large events. Johnson & Johnson announced a deal with the African Vaccine Acquisition Trust (AVAT) to bring relief to that continent. AVAT has an initial deal for 220 million doses of the single-shot vaccine with J&J subsidiary Janssen Pharmaceutica for delivery from the third quarter of this year. With EU approval already in its pocket, the US drugmaker also plans to begin European deliveries on April 19. The bloc has lagged far behind Britain in its vaccine rollout. Rising case numbers in Germany led Chancellor Angela Merkel to lambast the heads of the country's regional states, including her own party colleagues, for failing to reintroduce restrictions. In neighboring France, President Emmanuel Macron may announce new measures this week after partial regional shutdowns failed to keep the number of people in intensive care below its second-wave peak. Meanwhile, leaders from 23 countries including Merkel and Macron, the EU and WHO backed a push for a new global treaty to better prepare the world to tackle future pandemics. And the makers of the Russian-developed Sputnik V vaccine struck a deal with a Chinese firm to make more than 60 million doses, citing "rising demand" for the drug.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/who-experts-say-covid-probably-came-to-humans-from-animals/articleshow/81752161.cms||---

Losses at Archegos, run by former Tiger Asia manager Bill Hwang, had triggered a fire sale of stocks on Friday, a source familiar with the matter said. A phone message left for Archegos on Monday was not immediately returned. The warnings on big losses triggered a sell-off in banking stocks around the globe on Monday, with Morgan Stanley falling nearly 4% and Goldman sliding 1.5%. Nomura shares closed down 16.3%, a record oneday drop, while Credit Suisse shares tumbled 15% intraday, their biggest fall in a year. Nomura, Japan’s largest investment bank, warned on Monday it faced a possible $2-billion loss due to transactions with a US client, while Credit Suisse said a default on margin calls by a US fund could be “highly significant and material” to its first quarter results. The Swiss bank said a fund had “defaulted on margin calls” to it and other banks, meaning they were now exiting these positions. Two sources said Credit Suisse’s losses were likely to be at least $1 billion. One of those sources said the losses could go as high as $4 billion, a figure also reported by the Financial Times. Credit Suisse declined to comment on any estimate. Deutsche Bank said it had significantly de-risked its Archegos exposure without incurring any losses and was managing down its “immaterial remaining client positions”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/global-banks-see-big-losses-from-us-hedge-fund-default/articleshow/81752167.cms||---

It has also predicted an “intense wet spell” over northeast India until April 2. Under the influence of strong lower level southwesterly winds from the Bay of Bengal, fairly widespread to widespread rain with thunderstorm and lightning at isolated places are very likely over northeast India during March 29-April 2 with maximum activity on March 30-31, the IMD said. Isolated heavy rainfall on March 29 and April 1 and isolated heavy to very heavy rains on March 30 and 31 are very likely over south Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram, the weather department said. Isolated heavy rains are likely over Arunachal Pradesh on April 1. “It may cause landslides and inundation of low-lying areas at some places in south Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram during March 30 April 1,” the IMD said. Due to this weather system, localised flooding of roads, waterlogging in lowlying areas and closure of underpasses mainly in urban areas is expected in south Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Tripura from March 29 to April 1. There could also be an occasional reduction in visibility due to heavy rainfall, disruption of traffic due to waterlogging in roads leading to increased travel time, possibility of minor damage to kutcha roads and localised landslides, mudslides, the weather man said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/ne-to-see-thunderstorm-rain-for-4-days-from-today/articleshow/81752218.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||BMTC floats tender to lease 1,500 buses, staff fear privatisation move||BENGALURU: The cash-strapped Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) has decided to induct 1,500 buses on lease basis. BMTC on Monday floated a tender to select a service provider for procurement, operation and maintenance of non-AC diesel buses on gross cost contract (lease model). The tender is likely to be finalised by the end of April. "We'll allocate routes and pay the selected firm on a per-km basis. They will look after operation, maintenance and also deploy drivers. We'll provide conductors for ticket collection. This will reduce the operational costs as operating buses on lease will be economical compared to running and maintaining our own fleet," said a senior official. In the 2017-18 state budget, there was a plan to induct 1,500 diesel buses under the PPP model, but it didn't take off. Sources said the state government in the 2017-18 budget announced purchase of 3,000 buses, including 1,500 on purchase model and remaining on lease. Of the 1,500 buses on purchase model, BMTC has purchased 857 so far and 643 are in final stages of issuing work orders. For the 1,500 on lease model, the corporation has now called the tender. "This was delayed due to various reasons, including Covid-19 and delay in getting BMTC board approval, but now there is a need to induct more buses to ensure social distancing," said an official. Of the 1,268 old buses, the corporation scrapped only 155 so far. "We'll scrap those old buses once we induct new ones," he added. However, BMTC employees have been opposing the move to lease buses as they fear it could be part of privatisation plan. The move is also significant since the transport employees are planning an indefinite strike from April 7. TOI had carried an article - Govt mulls PPP model for BMTC; activists say budget ignores utility - on March 13. Earlier plan a failureWhile the utility had received poor response for its plan to lease electric buses, it is hoping for a better participation for diesel buses. Sources said BMTC's move to induct buses under the lease model in the past had failed. The corporation had hired non-AC buses from more than 60 contractors between 1997 and 2005, but they weren't maintained well and many of them were lying in depots. Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had in the recent budget allocated Rs 18,000 crore for a new scheme to augment public bus transport across the country. "It will facilitate deployment of innovative PPP models to enable private players to finance, acquire, operate and maintain over 20,000 buses," she had said. Chief minister BS Yediyurappa had said the state's public transport system would be strengthened by utilising maximum benefit of this project. Bengaluru South MP Tejasvi Surya recently advocated allowing private bus operators in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bmtc-floats-tender-to-lease-1500-buses-staff-fear-privatisation-move/articleshow/81752249.cms||Christin Mathew Philip
---||World||Brazil's Bolsonaro overhauls cabinet amid Covid surge||BRASILIA: Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro overhauled his government Monday, changing six cabinet members including the foreign, defense and justice ministers, as the far-right leader faced mounting pressure over a deadly surge of Covid-19. Bolsonaro, who comes up for re-election in October 2022, has drawn backlash with his handling of the pandemic in hard-hit Brazil, where the average daily death toll has nearly quadrupled since the start of the year to more than 2,600, pushing hospitals to breaking point. The shake-up comes the week after Bolsonaro replaced former health minister Eduardo Pazuello, an army general with no medical experience, with cardiologist Marcelo Queiroga, his fourth health minister of the pandemic. While speculation had been swirling that Bolsonaro was about to fire foreign minister Ernesto Araujo, who faced criticism for the government's problems securing more Covid-19 vaccines, many of the other changes came as a surprise. The president named army General Luiz Eduardo Ramos as his new chief of staff, career diplomat Carlos Franca as his new foreign minister, General Walter Souza Braga Netto -- the outgoing chief of staff -- as defense minister, and police commander Anderson Torres as justice minister. He also appointed a new attorney general, outgoing justice minister Andre Mendonca, and government secretary, Congresswoman Flavia Arruda -- the third woman in his 22-member cabinet. Two of the former cabinet members -- defense minister Fernando Azevedo e Silva and foreign minister Araujo -- had been in their posts since Bolsonaro took office in January 2019. Azevedo e Silva's exit was unexpected, and speculation swirled over the reason. Bolsonaro has been on a purge, amid growing dissatisfaction -- including from allies in the business sector -- over his handling of a pandemic that has now claimed more than 312,000 lives in Brazil, the second-highest death toll worldwide, after the United States. "The government is extremely fragile, as demonstrated by the instability at the top," said professor Mauricio Santoro of Rio de Janeiro State University (UERJ). "It's safe to say there is a crisis in the administration, beyond one or two ministries." Bolsonaro, who has long defied expert advice on Covid-19, now appears to fear his attacks on lockdowns, face masks and particularly vaccines could be a liability heading into next year's campaign. Brazil is struggling to deal with an explosion of infections, blamed partly on a local variant that is believed to be more contagious, at a time when vaccines are finally helping some other countries bring the pandemic under control. Vaccine shortages have put the government far off pace to meet the health ministry's target of immunizing the full adult population by the end of the year. Araujo, a key member of the government's so-called "ideological wing," admired former US president Donald Trump, and shared his hardline supporters' disgust with "globalism." "Globalists," he said last October, "are taking a disease caused by a virus, Covid, and trying to turn it into a huge prescriptive apparatus to reform and control the entire planet's social and economic relations." His vaccine diplomacy, or lack thereof, had come under attack, including during an appearance before Congress last week. The administration faces questions over its rejection of an offer last August to buy 70 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine -- which Bolsonaro joked could "turn you into an alligator" -- and its tense relations with Brazil's top trade partner, China. Chinese-developed CoronaVac is currently the most-administered Covid-19 vaccine in Brazil, but only because the government of Sao Paulo state defied resistance from the Bolsonaro administration to acquire it. Araujo, who took up the foreign minister post vowing to "resist Maoist China" and its plan "to dominate the world," had repeatedly provoked squabbles with Beijing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/brazils-bolsonaro-overhauls-cabinet-amid-covid-surge/articleshow/81752264.cms||---
---||---||Ensure one person, one vote in Kerala, HC tells EC||KOCHI: The Kerala high court on Monday ordered the Election Commission of India to ensure that there is no double voting by any voter in the state assembly election. A division bench of Chief Justice S Manikumar and Justice Shaji P Chaly gave the directive on a petition filed by opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala through advocate T Asaf Ali. After perusing details of multiple entries in the list produced by the petitioner, the court said it is of the prima facie view that there are discrepancies in the final voters’ list published by the election commission. The presence of multiple entries will facilitate a person to vote twice, which is not permissible in law, it said. Election commission’s counsel Deepu Lal Mohan submitted that efforts are being taken to find multiple entries in the voters’ list. The court, however, said it is of the view that a voter should be permitted to cast only one vote, wherever his name is registered. “Accordingly, we direct and make it clear that the Election Commission of India should ensure that there is no double voting by any voter. Election Commission should also ensure that sufficient State/Central force is posted at all voting places, to ensure fair and democratic election. To implement the above, steps should be taken on a war footing basis,” the order said. There shouldn’t be any room for complaint: HC Further, the court said, “All possible steps should be taken to ensure that there is no double voting. Orders of this Court should be implemented in letter and spirit, without any room for complaint.” It also ordered the election commission to file a counter affidavit by Tuesday, with supporting documents. The petition had alleged that there are multiple entries of voters in the list. It said 3,24,441 double votes and1,09,601 bogus votes were found across131 assembly constituencies in the final electoral roll published on January 20 but the election commission was not taking any action on it. Reacting to the interim order, Ramesh said the election commission should not have waited for someone to find the discrepancies. He said it took months to analyse the list and that is why he flagged the discrepancies at the eleventh hour. He alleged that the LDF had won the local body elections also with a rigged voters’ list. "The CPM workers are behind this and it is done with the knowledge of chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan," he said. CPM politburo member M A Baby, meanwhile, welcomed the order, saying the election commission should take immediate measures to ensure free and fair polls. BJP state general secretary George Kurian said the party wanted the election commission to follow the HC instructions in letter and spirit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/kerala/ensure-one-person-one-vote-in-kerala-hc-tells-ec/articleshow/81752294.cms||---

Both the Indian government and the seafarers’ organisations are concerned about the legal issues that the crew may face, including the possibility of criminal charges. According to sources in the shipping industry, one of the possibilities is that the captain and some of the crew may be restrained from travelling further. They could be placed under house arrest until investigation is completed into the cause of the accident. The ship management, however, has not explained anything about the legal procedures the crew will have to go through. Read AlsoCanal service provider says container ship in Suez set freeA canal service provider says that workers have successfully set free a colossal container ship that for nearly a week has been stuck sideways across the Suez Canal, one of the world's most crucial arteries for trade.Leth Agencies said that the vessel had been refloated on Monday.“There is a clear danger that the crew will be made scapegoats,” a senior person associated with the shipping industry said. Captain Sanjay Prashar, member, National Shipping Board (NSB), told TOI, “Firstly, it has to be ascertained as to how the giant ship ran aground. Facts can be checked by examining and listening to conversation in the ship voyage data recorder and one can come to an understanding as to what caused the mishap.” ‘Ever Given’ got stuck in the crucial Suez Canal on March 23, leading to a massive traffic jam. This resulted in more than 350 vessels — carrying everything from cattle, clothes to crude oil and furniture — getting stranded on both sides. While Berhard Schulte Ship Management (BSSM) did not reveal the names of the 25 Indian seafarers, it said: “All the 25 crew members are safe and accounted for and they remain in good health. They are working closely with all parties involved to refloat the vessel. The hard work and tireless professionalism of the master and crew are greatly appreciated.” Despite the appreciation that has come in the way of the Indian seafarers, a legal wrangle is what will inevitably follow. Meanwhile, the National Union of Seafarers of India (NUSI) based in Mumbai has expressed solidarity with the Indian seafarers. “The NUSI has promised solidarity with all Indian seafarers on board ‘Ever Given’. I got in touch with them. The seafarers are fine but stressed. They are not alone and we will support them whenever required and in whatever manner required,” NUSI general secretary Abdulgani Serang tweeted.

I will now look after you directly. I have decided to contest here as Nandigram is close to my heart. Please cast your vote early, peacefully. Don’t get intimidated.” The CM moved on a wheelchair along the meandering narrow concrete lane in Guriayapara, Gopalpur, Manoharpur to Khodambari, much to the excitement of locals as her security detail scurried to give her cover. Initially surprised to see the CM at their doorsteps, local women left their home chores to step out and greet her. Some came running to her with their problems. Sabita Kar, a homemaker of Gopalpur village, not only captured the CM arriving in their village on her cellphone, she was also happy for being able to tell her about the village problems. Banerjee smiled back and assured her that she will set up an office in Nandigram to look after all their issues. The day before, speaking at a public rally in Birulia Bazar, the CM said, “I have decided to contest from Nandigram as my respect for your struggle. Farmers are waging another struggle in the Singhu border. After you vote for me in Nandigram, I will go there (Singhu) to stand by the protesting farmers,” she said. “A Didimoni (teacher) has let me stay here for a year. I intend to build a small home for myself here. Even when I am not there, this home will serve as a memory of Nandigram-er agnikonya (Nandigram’s firebrand daughter). Nandigram will also have a CMO where people can come with their requests. I will stay here till the votes are over and will fly out to Siliguri on April 1 night,” she said. Addressing multiple public rallies on Sunday and Monday, the CM also reacted to Union home minister Amit Shah’s 26-out-of-30 claims, saying, “Why did you leave the remaining four (seats)? For CPM and Congress? Were you lurking in the EVMs to see who voted whom?” Banerjee also urged central forces not to raise hands on voters queuing up in polling booths. “We know under whose instructions these are being done. This isn’t your job.” “There are certain things which do not befit a Union home minister. When people in high office say something, it may be wrongly construed as information. Why is he confusing people? They know they have lost the match. Such things are being said to enthuse party workers,” the CM said. “It appears Bengal is now under 356 (President’s rule) and he is running everything,” she added. “Golla khabeh (They will get a big zero). I do not make such claims. But all I know is that people who had not voted for us in the Lok Sabha polls, have supported us this time,” the CM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mamata-on-wheelchair-knocks-on-voters-doors/articleshow/81748871.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

Out of 14 civilians killed in Myanmar on Monday, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) said at least eight were in the South Dagon district of Yangon. Security forces in the area fired a much heavier-calibre weapon than usual on Monday to clear a barricade of sand bags, witnesses said. It was not immediately clear what type of weapon was used. State television said security forces used "riot weapons" to disperse a crowd of "violent terrorist people" who were destroying a pavement and one man was wounded. A South Dagon resident on Tuesday said more gunfire could be heard in the area overnight raising concerns of more casualties. Police and a junta spokesman did not answer calls seeking comment. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged Myanmar's generals to stop the killings and repression of demonstrations. In a new tactic, protesters sought to step up a civil disobedience campaign on Tuesday by asking residents to throw garbage onto streets on key road intersections. "This garbage strike is a strike to oppose the junta," read a poster on social media. The move comes in defiance of calls issued via loudspeakers in some neighbourhoods of Yangon on Monday urging residents to dispose of garbage properly. REBEL GROUPS WARN MILITARY At least 510 civilians had been killed in nearly two months of efforts to stop protests, advocacy group AAPP said. The total killed on Saturday, the bloodiest day so far, had risen to 141, its figures showed. One of the main groups behind the protests, the General Strike Committee of Nationalities, called on Monday in an open letter for ethnic minority forces to help those standing up to the "unfair oppression" of the military. In a sign that the call may be gaining more traction, three groups in a joint letter on Tuesday called on the military to stop killing peaceful protesters and resolve political issues. The groups - which include the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, the Arakan Army and Ta’ang National Liberation Army - warned if the military did not do this they "will cooperate with all nationalities who are joining Myanmar's spring revolution in terms of self defence." Insurgents from different ethnic groups have battled the central government for decades for greater autonomy. Though many groups have agreed to ceasefires, fighting has flared in recent days between the army and forces in both the east and north. Heavy clashes erupted on the weekend near the Thai border between the army and fighters from Myanmar's oldest ethnic minority force, the Karen National Union (KNU). About 3,000 villagers fled to Thailand when military jets bombed a KNU area after a KNU force overran an army outpost and killed 10 soldiers, an activist group and media said. Thai authorities denied accounts by activist groups that more than 2,000 refugees had been forced back, but a Thai official said it was government policy for the army to block them at the border and deny access to outside aid groups. Myanmar's military has for decades justified its grip on power by saying it is the only institution capable of preserving national unity. It seized power saying that November elections won by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi's party were fraudulent, an assertion dismissed by the election commission. US Trade Representative Katherine Tai said the United States was suspending all trade engagement with Myanmar until the return of a democratically elected government. But foreign criticism and Western sanctions have failed to sway the generals and Suu Kyi remains in detention at an undisclosed location and many other figures in her party are also in custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/myanmar-death-toll-tops-500-as-protesters-stage-garbage-strike/articleshow/81752365.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: 20% of daily power needs met by solar energy||BENGALURU: Solar energy plants meet about 20 per cent of Karnataka’s daily power requirements as the overall share of renewables continues to climb. At 7,346 megawatts (MW), the state has the largest installed capacity of solar power in the country, and the biggest local plant is in Pavagada (Tumakuru). Last week, minister of state for power and energy (IC) RK Singh informed the Lok Sabha that Karnataka was far ahead of other states in harnessing sunlight. After Karnataka, Tamil Nadu (4,403 MW) has the largest installed capacity of solar power. Gujarat (4,068 MW) is third. According to data from Karnataka Power Corporation Limited, solar energy accounts for more than 50 per cent of the state’s installed capacity of green energy (13,544 MW). The government plans to expand it further by setting up a solar park in Firozabad, Kalaburagi. The park will have a capacity of 500 MW. “The first-mover advantage has given us the edge to expand our infrastructure. We will see such parks become the norm,” said additional chief secretary (energy) Kapil Mohan. Green energy meets at least 45 per cent of the state’s daily power needs. “Solar and wind power have a large contribution,” he said. The government has decided to reduce the focus on rooftop solar power generation as the scheme has become more commercial than intended. The original idea of promoting it was to help residential buildings and semicommercial sectors become self-sufficient. “The rooftop scheme was misused and it started draining the exchequer,” said an official of the energy department. As of February 28, Karnataka had installed rooftop solar capacity of 100 MW. Gujarat had 943 MW and Maharashtra 694 MW. The rising cost of solar panels has also weighed on the Karnataka government’s mind. The cost has increased by over 30 per cent because of a combination of factors linked to the border standoff between India and China, from where many solar components were earlier imported. “Karnataka is now focusing more on wind energy opportunities,” said an official, adding that the state had identified three locations in north Karnataka for wind energy projects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-20-of-daily-power-needs-met-by-solar-energy/articleshow/81752322.cms||Sandeep Moudgal
---||World||Myanmar crackdown death toll passes 500||YANGON: More than 500 people have been killed in the Myanmar junta's brutal crackdown on protests against its coup to oust civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, a local monitoring group said Tuesday. The grim toll was passed as world powers ramped up their condemnation of the military's ruthless campaign against the movement demanding the restoration of democracy and release of Suu Kyi. Washington suspended a trade pact with Myanmar and UN chief Antonio Guterres called for a united global front to put pressure on the junta after more than 100 protesters were killed in a bloody weekend of violence. Daily rallies across Myanmar by unarmed protesters have been met with tear gas, rubber bullets and live rounds. The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) said it had confirmed a total of 510 civilian deaths but warned the true toll was probably significantly higher. UN Secretary-General Guterres urged the Myanmar authorities to undertake a "serious democratic transition". "It is absolutely unacceptable to see violence against people at such high levels, so many people killed," Guterres told a news conference. "We need more unity... (and) more commitment from the international community to put pressure in order to make sure that the situation is reversed," he said. US President Joe Biden's administration announced Monday that the 2013 Trade and Investment Framework Agreement, which laid out ways to boost business but was not a fully fledged deal, would remain suspended until democracy is restored. "The United States strongly condemns the Burmese security forces' brutal violence against civilians," US Trade Representative Katherine Tai said, using Myanmar's former name of Burma. The statement effectively removes Myanmar from the Generalised System of Preferences, in which the United State grants duty-free access to some imports from developing nations if they meet key standards. Saturday saw the military mark its annual Armed Forces Day with a major parade of troops and armour in the capital Naypyidaw. But the day also saw bloody repression of protests around the country, with at least 107 people killed, including seven children. Despite the bloodshed, protesters turned out again on Monday, with mourners at funerals defiantly showing the three-fingered salute that has become emblematic of the movement. The UN Security Council will meet on Wednesday to discuss the situation, diplomatic sources said, after Britain called for emergency talks. France condemned the violence as "blind and deadly" and China added its voice to a chorus of international concern on Monday, calling for restraint from all sides. The Kremlin said it was "very concerned" by growing civilian casualties, despite acknowledging it was building ties with the military authorities. The US, Britain and the EU have all imposed sanctions in response to the coup and crackdown, but so far diplomatic pressure has not persuaded the generals to ease off.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/myanmar-crackdown-death-toll-passes-500/articleshow/81752439.cms||---

A tiny, precious jewel dropped on a sandy beach can be retrieved soon enough when you know where to look for it, and this is easy for the person who actually saw the jewel being dropped. Localized surveillance coupled with a combination of strategy and analysis enabled the team to come up with scandalous revelations which have shaken up the election commission and dragged the authority to court. The mission was termed ‘Operation Twins’ and unlike the past, the team dug deep to come up with solid material to substantiate the claims. Poring over a list of over 2.5 crore voters wasn’t enough to complete the process of identifying multiple votes. It involved a task of information gathering, data processing and crosschecking which engaged a network of booth-level workers, strategists and analysts who worked with the approval of topmost UDF leaders in Kerala. The process ranged from simple leg work, house visits to multi-layered analysis using digital tools. They started with the integrated draft list in November 2020 and by March they had spent days and nights, sending voters’ lists with suspicious entries to local-level booth workers and then subjecting it to cross verification. The actual process began in 2011 when Congress rued over narrow losses in some of the constituencies. It hurt more in 2016 and local body elections. There were isolated speculations about bogus votes, but often the intent was missing to establish the truth. Getting to the heart of the matter meant getting to the roots. “There was no one better informed than a local-level booth worker. This time, the booth workers were handpicked and given separate tasks. We purchased voters’ lists with photos from taluk offices and circulated it and the workers were asked to look for specific voters. They didn’t know each other and were only doing part of a larger task,” said one of the team members. Bogus votes were traditionally associated with ASD — absentee, shifted and the dead. The team broadened the search for more possibilities. Close scrutiny revealed that same-face voters emerged in multiple booths under same constituency. It began at Kozhikode and the team subjected every single list to close analysis to come up with more sets of irregularities.  The name, photo and address of an actual voter was found to be duplicated in multiple booths. “In more than 60% of these cases, the actual voter may not have any clue about her/his card being duplicated. The pertinent point is that who has got all these duplicate cards and if there is no deletion or freeze, how is the commission going to prevent these cards being misused,” one of the members said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/kerala/kerala-how-operation-twins-unearthed-bogus-votes/articleshow/81752444.cms||Aswin J Kumar

We're praying to god that she wake up or respond." These were the words of Raju Y, father of eight-year-old Rachel Prisha, who fell unconscious a year ago after a branch of a tree fell on her. Rachel was heading to her school on March 11 last year with Raju on scooter when a dry branch fell on her head on TC Palya Main Road. Rachel was severely hurt and she slipped into a coma. She remains in that state till date. The same day, a BWSSB employee, Srinivas, who had gone to meet AEE near Halasuru died after a huge branch from a tree fell on his car. "She would have celebrated her eighth birthday on March 7 with fanfare if not for the turn of events. It has literally shattered our lives. She does not know that Covid-19 virus brought the country to halt. She neither recognises anything nor responds," Raju said. Rachel is being treated at Manipal Hospitals, Old Airport Road. Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) is providing financial assistance for the treatment. The girl was treated in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for nearly a year and was recently shifted to ward. Dr Dheeraj Adiga, consultant neuro-rehabilitation physician, Manipal Hospitals, Bengaluru, said Rachel suffered severe injury. "She had to be incubated; she suffered traumatic brain and spine injury, brain hemorrhage and was managed in the pediatric intensive care. After a long stay in the PICU and multiple surgical interventions, she was stabilised. She was then put on comprehensive neuro-rehabilitation programme, but the recovery reached a plateau and a trial with hyperbaric oxygen therapy was initiated. After three weeks of initiation of this therapy, she has showed improvement and displays emotional behaviour like smiling and sobbing when spoken to," he said, adding that the road to recovery has been slow despite the best of care and intensive neuro rehabilitation. "My wife Pavithra and I have spent all our days since the incident at the hospital. Initially, we spent the nights in the lobbies, but on BBMP's request, the hospital allowed us to stay in a ward," said Raju. The girl needs to be monitored every minute as she gets epileptic seizures frequently and doctors need to be alerted. Raju has incurred Rs 12 lakh debt after the incident. "I had just set up a mobile shop and it was doing well. After this incident as we had to stay here, I closed it. Paying rent for house and shop and other expenses has pushed us to take loan of Rs 12 lakh," he said. Dr Shivakumar Shamrao, consultant, pediatric intensive care unit , Manipal Hospitals, said Rachel's recovery might take some more years or may not happen. "But there have been some positive signs as well," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-parents-in-debt-tree-fall-victim-in-a-coma-for-1-year/articleshow/81752490.cms||Kiran Parashar

Social media users shared videos and photos of fiery visuals outside the newly-constructed Chinese consulate here, where people chanted slogans and raised East Turkestan flags. Adelaide houses the largest Uyghur population in Australia, which has raised fears of Chinese spying. Several people have protested against the opening of the Chinese consulate due to national security fears. "China's new bloated consulate in Adelaide poses a clear security threat to our naval shipbuilding projects and SA based defence industries. It should never have been opened and must be closed. Australia's national security has to come first," tweeted Rex Patrick, an Independent Senator from South Australia. China has been rebuked globally for cracking down on Uyghur Muslims. They have been accused of sending them to mass detention camps, interfering in their religious activities and sending members of the community to undergo some form of forcible re-education or indoctrination. Beijing, on the other hand, has vehemently denied that human rights abuses in Xinjiang while reports from journalists, NGOs and former detainees have surfaced, highlighting the Chinese Communist Party's brutal crackdown on the ethnic community. Since 2017, a massive political 'reeducation' campaign against Uyghurs and other groups have been carried out by the government in Xinjiang, with scholars estimating that over a million people detained in camps, some transferred to prison and others pressured to work in factories, according to a report from Washington Post. Last week, the United States, the UK and Canada had slammed China for human rights violations and abuses against Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang."We, the Foreign Ministers of Canada and the United Kingdom, and the United States Secretary of State, are united in our deep and ongoing concern regarding China's human rights violations and abuses in Xinjiang," stated a joint statement released by the US State Department. The ministers took coordinated action on measures, in parallel to measures by the European Union, in a bid to send a clear message about the human rights violations and abuses in Xinjiang. The massive human rights violation against Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang has become a key point of discussion in the international community.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/hundreds-protest-outside-chinese-consulate-in-adelaide-against-rights-abuse-in-xinjiang/articleshow/81752533.cms||---

"Do you miss me yet?" a tuxedo-clad Trump asked at Saturday night's function, according to video posted on celebrity gossip site TMZ.  His question was met with whoops of delight and applause from guests at the wedding, between longtime Trump friends Megan Noderer and John Arrigo, according to Business Insider.  Trump used his moment in the nuptial limelight to blast President Joe Biden on several issues including the US-Mexico border, China and Iran.  "What's happening to the kids? They are living in squalor, they are living like nobody has ever seen," Trump said, referring to conditions on the border.  Since Biden took office, a surge of migrants including unaccompanied minors has tried to cross into the US.  Trump's administration drew criticism for dividing families at the border and keeping children in what some critics described as "cages."  He also referenced the November election, once again raising questions as to the integrity of the result even though he lost by seven million votes and all his attempts to challenge the outcome failed.  At the end of the former president's speech, he praised the newlyweds.  "You are a great and beautiful couple," the 74-year-old businessman said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/trump-talks-about-self-in-speech-at-couples-wedding/articleshow/81752566.cms||---

Saraswathi was interacting with reporters at Kovilpatti on Monday after offering prayers at the Shenbagavalli Poovanananthar temple along with Sasikala. Though Sasikala did not campaign for T T V Dhinakaran, thousands gathered to greet her. Saraswathi added that Sasikala and Dhinakaran will emerge as strong leaders in Tamil Nadu. She said that Sasikala wanted everyone to stay together to defeat the DMK but chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami not only forgot being grateful to Sasikala but also went to the height of deceit. “They should think who was responsible for forming the government when she was convicted,” she said. The spokesperson said that the cooker symbol has reached the corners of the state and people are waving them from their homes everywhere like they did during the R K Nagar bypoll. On Dhinakaran contesting from Kovilpatti, she said that every constituency is the same for a leader and recalled Jayalalithaa contesting from Bargur, Andipatti and Srirangam before R K Nagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-polls-aiadmk-will-come-back-to-sasikala-very-soon-says-saraswathi/articleshow/81752603.cms||---
---||Chennai||Researcher evolves plan to protect Madras hedgehogs||CHENNAI: Wildlife researcher Brawin Kumar has drafted a proposal to protect the Madras hedgehog (Paraechinus nudiventris), a small mammal, under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. The proposal, submitted to the state forest department, suggests population estimation, field-based research, establishing hedgehog conservation centres, and understanding and mitigating the threats faced by this species. Brawin said there is no policy to conserve this hedgehog. “This small mammal is facing threat from pet traders and buyers,” he said. “As a policy decision, the animal should be protected under the schedules of the Wildlife Protection Act. Declaring this as a scheduled animal will help in reducing the trapping and rearing of this animal,” he said. A coordinated national mission for the conservation of hedgehogs should be established, he said. Besides, declaring a national hedgehog day and celebrating it besides establishing conservation reserves in semi-arid landscapes in the state will help in the protection of this species, Brawin has said in the proposal. Conservation measures can be taken up by holding discussions among zoology students in each district in the state. Information about the hedgehog should be included in the school curriculum and made part of school education and awareness programme, he said. An adult Madras hedgehog can grow up to 25cm long and can weigh up to 300 grams. The body is covered with short stiff-pointed spines on the crown, back and lateral sides. The legs, tail, belly and ventral side of the head are covered by short hair. “The spines are very sharp at the tip and give protection from predators,” said Brawin.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/researcher-evolves-plan-to-protect-madras-hedgehogs/articleshow/81752619.cms||P Oppili

---||Chennai||Girl from Oman gets dual transplant from live donors in Chennai||CHENNAI: A portion of a liver from her uncle, a kidney from her mother and a 10-hour surgery at a city hospital gave a three-year-old girl from Oman a new lease of life. Doctors at Rela Hospital said when Lujjain was 10 months old, she was diagnosed with an enzyme defect in the liver – a condition called primary hyperoxaluria. The condition causes excess production of a molecule called oxalate. Tests showed deposits of oxalate in Lujjain’s heart, kidneys, joints and eyes. Elevated levels of oxalate resulted in kidney stones and renal failure. Doctors put her on dialysis. “Her problem was with the liver, but it presents symptoms in the kidney. Her kidneys were damaged because of the oxalate stones. Since both the organs were affected beyond repair, a dual transplant was the only option,” said senior transplant surgeon Dr Mohamed Rela, who heads Rela Hospital. With failed organs, Lujjain weighed just 8.2kg. “Usually, we wait till the child reaches 10kg of weight, but in this case, we decided against it since her condition was deteriorating,” he said. On January 28, doctors at the hospital used a segment of liver donated by the girl’s uncle and left kidney from her mother to replace her ailing organs. “It was challenging to find a donor. An adult kidney is large and doesn't fit into the child’s abdomen. It was even more difficult for this child because she was underweight,” said senior consultant Dr Gomathy Narasimhan. fter surgery, doctors worked on Lujjain’s nutrition levels, infection control and immune suppression management. On Monday, doctors said her weight has increased to 9kg. “She will not need daily dialysis,” said hospital’s paediatric liver specialist Dr Naresh Shanmugam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/girl-from-oman-gets-dual-transplant-from-live-donors-in-chennai/articleshow/81752638.cms||---

---||World||Traffic in Suez Canal resumes after stranded ship refloated||ISMAILIA, Egypt: Shipping was on the move again late on Monday in Egypt's Suez Canal after tugs refloated a giant container ship which had been blocking the channel for almost a week, causing a huge build-up of vessels around the waterway. With the 400-metre-long (430-yard) Ever Given dislodged, 113 ships were expected to transit the canal in both directions by early Tuesday morning, Suez Canal Authority (SCA) chairman Osama Rabie told reporters. He said a backlog of 422 ships could be cleared in 3 -1/2 days. The Ever Given had become jammed diagonally across a southern section of the canal, the shortest shipping route between Europe and Asia, in high winds early on March 23. Evergreen Line, which is leasing the Ever Given, said the ship would be inspected for seaworthiness in the Great Bitter Lake, which separates two sections of the canal. "The ship was ready for limited navigation after an initial inspection and not a single container was damaged, but a second investigation will be more precise and if it was affected it will show," Rabie said. At dawn on Monday, rescue workers from the SCA working with a team from Dutch firm Smit Salvage partially refloated the ship and straightened it in the canal. After several hours it shifted briefly back across the canal before being manoeuvred free by tugs as the tide changed, a canal source said. "The time pressure to complete this operation was evident and unprecedented," said Peter Berdowski, CEO of Smit Salvage owner Boskalis, after the Ever Given was refloated. The company said approximately 30,000 cubic metres of sand had been dredged to refloat the 224,000-tonne container ship and a total of 11 tugs and two powerful sea tugs were used to pull the ship free. Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement (BSM), the technical managers of the container ship, said there were no reports of pollution or cargo damage. QUEUE Vessels waiting to transit the canal include dozens of container ships, bulk carriers, oil tankers and liquefied natural gas (LNG) or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) vessels, Nile TV reported. Rabie said that within four days, traffic would return to normal. "We'll work day and night to end the backlog." Vessels similar in size to the Ever Given, which is one of the world's largest container ships, could pass through the canal safely, he added, and the SCA would not change its policy on admitting such ships. Shipping group Maersk said the knock-on disruptions to global shipping could take weeks or months to unravel. Owners and charterers of delayed ships face at least $24 million in expenses they will be unable to recoup as their insurance policies do not cover them and cargo owners could also face uninsured losses, industry sources said. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who had not publicly commented on the blockage, said Egypt had ended the crisis and assured resumption of trade through the canal. Oil prices fell 1 percent after the ship was refloated while shares of Taiwan-listed Evergreen Marine Corp rose. About 15% of world shipping traffic transits the Suez Canal, which is an important source of foreign currency revenue for Egypt. The stoppage was costing the canal up to $15 million a day. Shipping rates for oil product tankers nearly doubled after the ship became stranded, and the blockage has disrupted global supply chains, threatening costly delays for companies already dealing with COVID-19 restrictions. Maersk was among shippers rerouting cargoes around the Cape of Good Hope, adding up to two weeks to journeys and extra fuel costs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/traffic-in-suez-canal-resumes-after-stranded-ship-refloated/articleshow/81752668.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Covid tally crosses 4 lakh in Mumbai, low tests make daily cases dip||MUMBAI: Thanks to fewer Covid-19 tests done on Sunday, the state and the city registered comparatively lower cases on Monday. After reporting over 40,000 cases on Sunday (the highest daily detections so far), the state was down to reporting 31,643 cases on Monday. The BMC registered 5,890 cases on Monday as against the highest-ever 6,923 cases on Sunday. The total caseload of the city crossed the 4 lakh mark on Monday and with the addition of 12 deaths, the total toll rose to 11,665. The latest one lakh cases were added in 75 days, as against 107 days taken to add the previous one lakh cases. The city had reported 3 lakh cases as of January 13 and it had reported 2 lakh cases as of September 28. Total cases in the state rose to 24.45 lakh and with the addition of 102 fatalities, the toll reached 54,283. "The BMC has been managing 45,000 to 47,000 tests every day except on Sundays when we have a shortage of staff," said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. BMC commissioner I S Chahal said city cases could breach the 10,000-a-day mark soon. The ongoing second wave is reportedly caused by a newer strain of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that is more infectious, but causes a less severe form of Covid-19. "We are seeing a younger population, between 20 and 40 (being infected). Even children are being infected across Maharashtra and they are fast spreaders. This is a huge area of concern," said Maharashtra government's task force member Dr Shashank Joshi. The BMC has plans to increase the number of beds in some of its facilities -- for instance, 300-plus beds will be added to SevenHills Hospital, Andheri, this week and almost 1,000 beds to the NESCO jumbo facility in Goregaon. "We still have over 3,000 beds vacant in our hospitals. There is no acute emergency," added Kakani. Nearly one-third cases of the state were added by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. The region added 10,181 cases and 24 deaths, taking the total cases to 8.7 lakh in the region and 20,233 deaths. Meanwhile, the Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation has, as a preventive measure, restricted entry of citizens and political representatives into the KDMC headquarters and ward offices. The order states that in case of emergency work, visitors need to take prior appointment on phone. The twin city reported 941 new patients in the last 24 hours, taking the tally to 77,430, and toll to 1,250. Navi Mumbai saw 492 cases and two deaths, taking the count to 64,265 cases and the toll to 1,169. Panvel reported 274 Covid cases on Monday, taking the total caseload to 35,231 and toll to 670.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/covid-tally-crosses-4-lakh-in-mumbai-low-tests-make-daily-cases-dip/articleshow/81752718.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Chennai||Loss of autonomy stymies growth of organ transplant||By Dr J AmalorpavanathanA little more than a decade ago, Tamil Nadu had helped lay the foundation of the model transplant system that is now emulated across the country.  Initiated with the aim to help those suffering from organ failures, a regulated cadaver transplant programme was started in the state in October 2008 as a result of dedicated efforts of a few officers, doctors and NGOs, with support from chief minister M Karunanidhi. From a modest beginning, TN achieved rapid growth in deceased donor organ transplants, because of its decentralisation, flexibility, participatory planning and transparency. Leading journals, including the British Medical Journal, wrote about its success and it even got a commendation at a World Health Organisation meet. This was the first time that any state in India could organise such an efficient programme with limited funds. Because of this, liver and heart transplants developed fast in TN and people from other states came down here to get an organ transplant and a new life. But a closer look will show gaps in the system have developed of late. While Tamil Nadu bagged the Best State award in cadaver donation for six consecutive years till 2009, the number of donors has declined, after steadily peaking till 2016 (see graphic). A policy that allows the Centre to control the operations of the state is the only change during this time. One of the key reasons for the success of this programme in 2008 was that a series of government orders (GO) were issued to fill the gaps in the Transplantation of Human Organs (THO) Act, 1994. Seven GOs were issued within a few months.  The complex area of who will get the organs altruistically donated by a deceased person was navigated effectively because of such participatory exercise. An independent system was established to maintain a waitlist and prioritise organ allocation with an inclusive advisory committee guiding it. Many other states virtually copied these GOs and established their system. A need was later felt to formalise this arrangement and the Transplant Authority of Tamil Nadu (Transtan), was formed in 2015 to run this programme. The 1994 THO Act was amended by Parliament in 2011 and its rules were issued in 2014 by the Union government.  Health is a state subject in our Constitution and any central law in this area will become operational in the state only if the state assembly accepts it. One of the major issues in the amended law is the creation of a central agency called National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (NOTTO). The act gives this agency the power to even decide which state body will distribute the donated organs and control its functioning. The act gives wide ranging powers to this agency to contol the functions of state bodies.  Since its start, NOTTO has been writing to hospitals in all states — overlooking the state organisations — demanding that they upload their patient details to the waitlist maintained by it. TN refused to accept this sort of restrictions on the programme. When chief minister J Jayalalithaa was at the helm, no pressure from Delhi could make the state accept these draconian restrictions. But after her demise, things seem to have changed. Unfortunately, the success of the TN programme had a side effect that the political establishment, which remained aloof for a long time, saw in it the opportunity to claim credit for its achievements, with the main focus of getting a national award year after year. Sensing that the Union government was putting a lot of pressure on TN to adopt the amended law, a few key persons involved in the evolution of this state programme wrote to the government pointing out the setback this successful initiative could experience if the amendment is accepted. But the state appears to have buckled to this pressure to accept central control of the programme. On March 24, 2020, the TN legislative assembly passed a resolution accepting the amended law. But, for some strange reason, such a major decision was not made known to the public. There was no press release and no information provided to the stakeholders except for a cryptic circular from Transtan, a couple of months later, directing them to use the new forms of the amended rules.  Even the Transtan website, which has all the GOs and important notifications, has chosen not to put up this important notification. This comes as a surprise, since the government issues press releases for matters like a rare surgery done at a government hospital, but continues to be silent on such a major issue which surrenders the state’s autonomy to the Government of India. It is losing control of a field in which the state’s independent and tireless effort had led to its growth. Surrendering our right in a state subject, like health, to the Union government, is sad and as records show stunts our growth.

---||Chennai||Without election frills, professionals, activists fight independently||Independent candidate from Pollachi R Muthukumarasamy does not have any blaring speakers, campaign vehicles or a large group of cadres following him when he goes door-to-door canvassing for votes. He along with a friend travels on a two-wheeler from a village to another, introducing himself and distributing pamphlets that explains his poll promises. The 46-year-old social activist, who is one of the opponents of the three-time winner AIADMK leader Pollachi V Jayaraman, entered the fray to work for the public instead of just blaming politicians for not doing anything for his constituency.In the poll juggernaut of money and muscle power, there are a bunch of independent candidates contesting against the big names to send out the message of democracy. This includes bankers and IT professionals, who quit their jobs and have vowed to do their bit in bring about a change. "I’m not sure about my chances of winning this election but I wish to create a sense of fear in the minds of politicians," said M Loganathan, an independent candidate from Coimbatore (north) constituency, who has been campaigning against cash-for-vote for more than a decade. The advocate-turned-activist has already garnered a small following. On the first day of his campaign about four days ago, as many as 200 people joined him and, walked behind Loganathan as he canvassed. In Chennai, Murali Balaji, a former employee at Amazon, and his group of friends are contesting from Velachery and other key constituencies in the city. The team, which had been helping out locals in fixing their civic woes, decided to enter electoral politics to make a lasting difference as they believe they can be a role model to other youngsters and weed out corruption.For urban planner P Karthick Krishna, a National Institute of Technology graduate, it was his yearning to implement schemes for the public that made him that to the legislative route from Manapparai. "I want to be the voice of the planning fraternity, which wants to improve the per capita income of people and their living standards," he said. The vision to work for the greater good is what keeps most of them going. For instance, S Praveen, a lead auditor contesting at Ambattur in Chennai, says he wants to improve the education standards and employability of courses offered in technical institutions but not many have supported his attempts. He is optimistic that his election campaign would make more people aware of his ideas and that would strengthen his fight.A common struggle of these independent candidates is lack of funds and getting permission to meet public and distributing their pamphlets. "Two major poll expenses are printing pamphlets and fuel for the vehicle. Unlike major political parties, I cannot afford to bring people in large numbers or follow other campaign strategies. I have done some productive work as an activist and explain those to people when I canvass for votes," he said.Every night after the campaign, Karthick Krishna spends a few hours explaining to his friends about how much money he had spent on his campaign and how much more he needs. "Unlike political fronts, I don’t have any financial back. It is my friends who financially support me and I feel it’s my duty to keep them informed about my expenses. Based on the requirements, they transfer a few thousands of rupees every day," he said. Similar is the case with K Maniraj, an industrialist, contesting as an independent candidate from Singanallur constituency, who is being supported by fellow industrialists. "My friends help me financially and take turns to come with me for campaigns and when we need to cover many houses, we split up," he said. It’s confidence and intention that works, feels independent candidate from Sirrangam constituency in Trichy, V Annalakshmi. "Unlike political fronts, I don’t need muscle power which can be purchased easily. True that only a handful of people accompany me for my campaigns, but they are my true supporters," says Annalakshmi, one of the handful of women contesting as an Independent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/without-election-frills-professionals-activists-fight-independently/articleshow/81752774.cms||Nivedha Selvam

Officials reported eight new locally acquired cases on Tuesday, taking the total in the latest outbreak to 15 so far. All of the cases were linked to two distinct virus clusters, one related to a doctor and the second to a nurse, authorities said. "The fact that we have these cases that are linked is good news," Queensland state Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk told reporters. "Do we expect to see more cases? Probably. Probably, we will see more." Brisbane, the state capital, has been placed under a three-day lockdown until Thursday, requiring more than 2 million city residents to stay home except for essential work, healthcare, grocery shopping or exercise. The restrictions upended holiday plans for thousands as the lockdown is scheduled to end just a day before the Easter long weekend and the school term break in Australia, a popular time for vacations. Several states closed their borders with Queensland, while others will require travelers from the virus hotspots to self-isolate for two weeks on their return. Brisbane Airport forecast a steep drop in the number of domestic travelers passing through the airport by the weekend compared with its pre-lockdown expectations. "This week we had forecast 35,000 to 40,000 per day. However, today this number was closer to 15,000 and we anticipate this may drop to under 10,000 per day by the weekend," a spokeswoman told Reuters. Lockdown and border controls could put the state's businesses under more strain as the government's A$90 billion ($69 billion) job subsidy scheme ended on Sunday. Neighbouring New South Wales (NSW) state, Australia's most populous, is also on alert after two of the Queensland cases, a nurse and her sister, travelled while unknowingly infectious to Byron Bay, a tourist town just south of the Queensland border and home to Hollywood A-listers such as Chris Hemsworth. Health alerts have been issued for a hotel, cafe and restaurant exposed to the virus as officials urged patrons to test and isolate. "I hope that we do not have any cases emerge in New South Wales, but I won't be surprised if we did. So, we need to brace ourselves," NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said. Snap lockdowns, social distancing rules and speedy contact tracing systems have helped Australia to contain fresh clusters in recent months. It has reported just under 29,300 cases and 909 deaths since the pandemic began.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/australias-queensland-warns-of-more-covid-19-cases-easter-travel-plans-on-hold/articleshow/81752830.cms||---
---||World||An Asian American official bared his chest, revealing scars from his army service||As town meetings go, the discussion was fairly routine, meandering from what Memorial Day celebrations might look like in the second year of the coronavirus pandemic, to a federal grant application for bulletproof vests for police officers. But when the time came for the trustees in West Chester Township, Ohio, to deliver personal remarks at the group’s most recent meeting, the board’s chairman, Lee Wong, who is Asian American, did something unusual. Wong removed his suit jacket and his tie and unbuttoned his dress shirt, according to a video of the board’s March 23 meeting, which has since drawn widespread attention. Then, he lifted his undershirt, revealing scars on his chest that he said he got while serving in the US Army. Wong, 69, said he could no longer endure the indignities of prejudice against Asian Americans or having people question his loyalties to America. “Here is my proof,” he said. “Now is this patriot enough? I’m not ashamed to walk around anymore. Before I was inhibited. People looked at me strange.” It was the board’s first meeting since March 16, when a gunman killed six women of Asian descent in a series of attacks on massage businesses in the Atlanta area, leaving eight people dead. Prosecutors are weighing whether to classify the shootings as a hate crime, but the rampage came amid a rise in violent crimes targeting people of Asian descent across the United States, which advocates say has been exacerbated by pandemic-related racism. Wong immigrated to the United States from the island of Borneo in 1971, according to a profile about him in The Cincinnati Enquirer last year when he ran unsuccessfully for the state Senate. He is a Republican, though the township board is a nonpartisan body, the Enquirer reported. He was first elected to the board in West Chester Township, a northern suburb of Cincinnati, in 2005. About halfway through the board’s meeting, Wong said he would depart from protocol and had something that he wanted to share. He said he came to the United States when he was 18 and once had been assaulted in a racially motivated attack in Chicago. For too long, Wong said, he had put up with racism but had been too afraid to speak out because he feared facing more discrimination and abuse. “In the last few years, things are just getting worse and worse,” he said. “There are some ignorant people that will come up to me and say that I don’t look American or patriotic enough. Now, that really gets my goat.” He said that Asian Americans had been subjected to widespread prejudice, particularly restaurant workers. “They are hardworking Americans,” he said. “Some even served in the US armed forces — not Chinese army. US Army.” Noting that he had been a US citizen for quite some time, Wong said that he had served in the US Army for 20 years. He got the scars while serving at Fort Jackson in South Carolina, The Journal-News of Hamilton, Ohio, reported. Efforts to reach Wong on Sunday were not immediately successful, but he told CNN that he got the scars after undergoing multiple surgeries for cuts that got infected during combat training. “People question my patriotism, that I don’t look American enough,” Wong said at the meeting. “They cannot get over this face.” Wong said the country had significant work to do to address bigotry. “You know prejudice is hate,” he said. “We need to be kinder, gentler to one another, because we are all the same. We are one human being on this earth.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/an-asian-american-official-bared-his-chest-revealing-scars-from-his-army-service/articleshow/81752842.cms||---

A total of six persons, including the man who is accused of rape, and five villagers, have been arrested. A video showing the girl and the accused tied with ropes, being beaten and forced to walk in public in the village under Jobat police station amidst slogans of “Bharat Mata Ki Jai” has gone viral on social media. The girl was rescued by police, a senior officer said. Sub-Divisional Officer of Police (SDOP) Dilip Singh Bilwal said two cases were registered on Sunday on the FIRs lodged by the victim. “One of the cases was registered against the 21-year-old man who is accused of rape. Another FIR was registered against family members of the girl and villagers for parading her in the village and beating her,” Bilwal said, adding that the rape accused is married with two children. He has been booked under sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and under provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. Family members and relatives of the victim were booked under sections 294 (Obscene act in public places), 355 (Assault or criminal force with intent to dishonour person), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 342 (wrongful confinement) and other sections of the IPC, the officer said.

This levy was supposed to end this month but had to be extended by a year — as of now as the situation will be reviewed this December — due to drastic fall in passenger numbers since the Covid outbreak. The Airports Economic Regulatory Authority (AERA) had in December 2012 allowed Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL) a levy of DF of Rs 100 and Rs 600 per departing domestic and international passenger, respectively, to cover a deficit of Rs 3,845 crore in airport project financing, upto April 30, 2021. Then in 2016, MIAL was allowed to charge a levy of Rs 20 and Rs 120 per departing domestic and international passenger, respectively, to finance metro works to garner Rs 518 crore. Both these levies were merged to a combined DF of Rs 120 and Rs 720 per domestic and international embarking passenger, respectively that was to be charged till March 31, 2021. After the outbreak of Covid, passenger numbers dropped drastically at all airports, including Mumbai Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) and the collection states went awry. “…request was received from MIAL for extension of period of levy (in September 2020) due to shortfall in the collection of both the levies…. Airports Authority of India (AAI) confirmed that as on March 31, 2020, Rs 524.6 crore are yet to be collected under project DF, and, a deficit of Rs 102.7 crore is to be collected under metro DF,” AERA says in its order last week. The April 2020-January 2021 period saw domestic and international fall by 76.4% and 91.9%, respectively, over same period last year. “As a result, collection of DF during the period April 2020 to March 2021 is expected to be much less than the anticipated amount and the deficit would not be covered by March 31, 2021. 31.03.2021.” Accordingly, AERA says it examined the facts and expected a short fall of Rs 546.6 crore this fiscal when MIAL may be able to get Rs 80.6 crore from his head. “In view of the(se) facts, there is a necessity to extend the levy of DF beyond March 2021, to recover the sanctioned DF amount. However, the traffic projections for the period FY2021-22 and FY2022-23 are tentative and may change depending on Covid situation and other economic factors and collection may vary from the present calculations. Accordingly, it is decided to extend the levy of DF up to March 2022,” the order says. The regulator will reviewed the traffic position after December 2021 and “further action/order will be issued based on such review.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/covid-effect-flyers-out-of-mumbai-to-keep-paying-development-fee-for-a-year-more/articleshow/81752966.cms||Saurabh Sinha
---||Kolkata||China approves radical overhaul of Hong Kong's political system||HONG KONG: Chinese leaders endorsed a sweeping overhaul of Hong Kong's electoral system Tuesday, slashing its number of directly elected seats and ensuring a majority of the city's lawmakers will be selected by a reliably pro-Beijing committee. The new measures, which bypassed Hong Kong's legislature and were imposed directly by Beijing, are the latest move aimed at quashing the city's democracy movement after huge protests. "President Xi Jinping signed presidential orders to promulgate the amended annexes," China's official Xinhua news agency said in a short report. Hong Kong's 7.5 million residents are still not sure what the new law contains with no details yet published. But Tam Yiu-chung, Hong Kong's sole delegate on China's rubber-stamp parliament, gave a breakdown of what the new measures included. "The amendments were unanimously passed by 167 members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress," he told AFP. Under the new law, Hong Kong's legislature will be expanded from 70 to 90 seats. Only 20 of those seats will now be directly elected, down from 35, Tam said. The majority -- 40 -- will be chosen by a reliably pro-Beijing committee. The remaining 30 will be chosen by "functional constituencies" -- bodies representing certain industries and special interest groups that have also been historically loyal to Beijing. Anyone standing for election will also have to be vetted for their political views. Tam revealed that the vetting committee would be created by authorities in Hong Kong and the city's new national security apparatus would have a say in who gets approved. "The National Security Committee and the National Security Police will provide reports on every single candidate to assist the vetting by the qualification review committee," he told AFP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/china-approves-radical-overhaul-of-hong-kongs-political-system/articleshow/81752968.cms||---

---||Business||MobiKwik denies data breach of 3.5 million users amid IPO plans||NEW DELHI: Digital wallet and payments company MobiKwik, reportedly planning an initial public offering (IPO) around September this year to raise $200-250 million, on Monday denied claims that sensitive data of millions of its users has been leaked. Independent cyber security researchers have claimed that a database containing KYC details of nearly 3.5 million users of MobiKwik is up for sale on the Dark Web. First tweeted by independent cyber security researcher Rajshekhar Rajaharia and then by French researcher Elliot Alderson on Monday, the alleged breach includes 8.2TB data containing users' phone numbers, emails, hashed passwords, addresses, bank accounts and card details. MobiKwik, however, vehemently denied any such breach. "Some media-crazed so-called security researchers have repeatedly attempted to present concocted files wasting precious time of our organisation as well as members of the media," the company said in a statement shared with IANS. "We thoroughly investigated and did not find any security lapses. Our user and company data is completely safe and secure," the company added. Alderson had tweeted: "Probably the largest KYC data leak in history." Rajaharia had claimed earlier that "11 crore Indian cardholder's cards' data including personal details and KYC soft copy (PAN, Aadhaar etc) allegedly leaked from the company's server in India". According to the researchers, the entire database is available for 1.5 Bitcoin (nearly $84,000) on the Dark Web. The reports surfaced as MobiKwik last week raised $7.2 million in a funding round prior to the listing on the stock exchange, according to regulatory filings with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. According to Entrackr, Mobikwik's post-money valuation currently stands at $493 million with the latest funding round.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/mobikwik-denies-data-breach-of-3-5-million-users-amid-ipo-plans/articleshow/81752988.cms||---
---||World||Top flight: South Korea's 18-year-old world drone champion||HWASEONG: In a South Korean rice field, the teenage world drone-racing champion is preparing to defend his title in one of the planet's fastest and highest-tech sports. But at all of 18 years old, Kang Chang-hyeon fears he is quickly passing his prime to compete at top flight levels. On the starting signal, Kang and his three teammates send their craft buzzing furiously into the air and hurtling around an obstacle course set up on the bare earth in Hwaseong, south of Seoul. The only human movement was the twitches of fingers on handsets, which the pilots use to control the aircraft while wearing virtual-reality goggles that give them a drone's-eye view of the route. Three laps and around one minute later, the race was over and the technical analysis began in a dedicated tent, with pilots, coaches, technicians and parents poring over flight data. Like Formula One, drone-flying depends both on precision engineering and pilot skill. Racing drones are custom-built by competitors and their teams, and reach speeds of up to 170 kilometres (105 miles) per hour. But races are so close, with timings measured in thousandth of a second. And it is a young flyer's game. Lightning-fast reflexes, visual sharpness and hours of training are the key to success, according to Kang. He says he is already facing physical decline as a new generation of younger rivals arrives, some of them still in primary school. "Those qualities are the best in your early- to mid-teenage years," said the still pimply-faced pilot. Kang said his reflexes were "inevitably" slowing with each passing year, and he was not ruling out retirement before turning 20. It will be "pretty tough to compete against them in my adult years," he said. "I think I may not make it past this year." One 12-year-old girl already has him in her sights. "When I first met Kang Chang-hyeon, I was in awe of him and it felt like a dream," said Jeong Ryeo-won, after taking part in a league round in the southern county of Hadong. But now she "really wants" to beat him: "He is my role model, so I hope to compete against him at the world championships, but win." Only three years after first flying a toy drone, Kang, at age 16, took the world title at a 2019 championship in China, where South Korean pilots dominated. "Maintaining composure is key to winning because a split-second decision can determine the outcome of a race," he said. "Minimising your mistakes while staying calm regardless of who's ahead of you is critical." Kang's high school in rural Hongseong county has sought to capitalise on his success by promoting itself as a specialist drone school -- with Kang as its ambassador -- offering lessons in piloting to attract more pupils. But the coronavirus pandemic deprived him of the chance to defend his crown at the peak of his abilities, when the Swiss-based Federation Aeronautique Internationale, the world governing body for air sports, was forced to cancel the 2020 world championships. "I could have competed really well last year," he said. Like other young South Korean men achieving global success, from pop stars BTS to Spurs striker Son Heung-min, compulsory military service weighs on his path. South Korea remains technically at war with nuclear-armed North Korea, and all able-bodied South Korean males must spend around 18 months in the forces before they turn 30. The only exceptions are for Olympic medallists and Asian Games champions, along with the winners of some international classical music competitions. But Kang's skills could be of "great value" for the armed forces, said his coach Kim Jae-hong, who led the national team at the 2019 world championships. South Korea's 555,000-strong military is heavily outnumbered by North Korea's 1.28 million troops. But the South enjoys technological superiority including, according to the defence ministry, a fleet of around 800 drones for training and experimental combat purposes. "The drone units' monitoring mission is basically based on controlling a drone with a camera live feed, which is the same for drone racing," the coach said. "Kang and other racers can contribute greatly to its mission while maintaining their drone-control skills."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/top-flight-south-koreas-18-year-old-world-drone-champion/articleshow/81752989.cms||---

The state has surpassed its quota of 25.25 crore man days of labour by providing 25.43 crore work days. This, following the constant monitoring of the panchayat raj department by chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy to provide employment to scores of daily wage workers who had been struggling as a result of the pandemic. “As much as 5,818 crore has been spent on wages to workers over the last one year. This is the highest ever in the history of the state,” panchayat raj minister Peddireddy Ramachandra Reddy said on Monday. He added that they were expecting to cross 26 crore man days of employment within the next two days. The minister said the chief minister had directed officials to provide employment to all those who wanted to work under National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS) while following Covid-19 guidelines. The minister said the CM had asked officials to focus on migrant workers to ensure that no one was left hungry. He said they have taken up works worth 10,170 crore through NREGS for which 5,818 crore was spent exclusively on wages to workers. He said that 3,965 crore were spent on skilled wages and material component. “The department has granted work to a whopping 54 lakh people in a single day on June 9, 2020 following the advice of the chief minister,” said Peddireddy. The minister said the chief minister’s vision had helped the state create assets worth 9,871 crore. He said they had constructed permanent buildings for village secretariats, Rythu Bharosa Kendras, bulk milk chilling units (BMCU), Anganwadi centres, YSR clinics besides roads and drains. He said that they have constructed close to 50,000 buildings by synchronising NREGS.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/ap-sets-new-record-for-providing-jobs-to-poor/articleshow/81752954.cms||Samdani MN

Jaishankar will attend the conference at the joint invitation of his counterparts from Afghanistan and Tajikistan. He is expected to meet leaders of other participating countries on the sidelines, according to a March 26 statement from the external affairs ministry. The conference, being hosted in Tajikistan, is focused on strengthening a regional and international consensus for Afghan peace. However, the highly-anticipated meeting between Indian and Pakistani foreign ministers has not been scheduled so far. Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, who left for the conference on Monday, had told Dawn that "no meeting has been finalised or requested". The development comes in the backdrop of the resumption of the 2003 ceasefire between Pakistan and India, reached at the end of February and the meeting held on Indus water sharing after a gap of two years. On Monday, Jaishankar met Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani and held a discussion on the Afghan peace process. "Honour to call on President @ashrafghani before the commencement of @HeartofAsia_IP Conference. Shared our perspectives on the peace process," Jaishankar tweeted. According to the MEA, the minister had earlier visited Dushanbe in June 2019 to attend the fifth Summit of Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia. The ongoing visit is in continuation of the frequent high-level exchanges between the two countries that will further strengthen the close strategic partnership between India and Tajikistan. Last week, Afghan foreign minister Haneef Atmar visited India and held-back-to-back talks with Jaishankar and NSA Ajit Doval. In New Delhi, during the meeting of the Afghan foreign minister with Jaishankar on the peace process, the two sides reviewed the Troika Peace Meeting in Moscow and assessed the final declaration of the meeting as positive for strengthening and advancing the peace process. During the meeting with NSA, both discussed the peace plan of the Afghanistan government for the success of Afghanistan peace negotiations. Recently, it was reported that the US is reviewing the Doha agreement with the Taliban while also keeping all options on the table when it comes to the May 1 deadline for withdrawal from Afghanistan. The Doha agreement was signed in February 2020 between the Taliban and United States with an aim to end the 18-year old conflict in Afghanistan. The agreement calls for a full US withdrawal from Afghanistan if the terror group upholds counterterrorism commitments such as denying safe haven to al Qaeda. Meanwhile, the Taliban warned the United States on Friday against defying the May 1 deadline for the withdrawal of US and Nato troops from Afghanistan, promising a "reaction" though failing to specify exactly what it would be.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/s-jaishankar-to-attend-heart-of-asia-conference-in-tajikistan/articleshow/81753120.cms||---

This election, the absence of former AIADMK general secretary J Jayalalithaa, who was a role model for many women, could make a difference. It then throws up the question as to which party the women are likely to choose this election where they constitute 3.19 crore and outnumber men. Be it K Rita, 42, a daily wager, selling bajjis on the Marina beach or J Monika, 25, an advocate practicing in the Madras high court, they complain about skyrocketing prices of essential commodities, fuel and LPG. Several are hit hard by layoffs and a section of the women have not taken kindly to misogynistic remarks of some male candidates and campaigners. The video clips of DMK functionaries assaulting women in a beauty parlour and in a hospital are also doing the rounds now.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); But this election too, the two main Dravidian parties, the AIADMK and the DMK, are wooing them with free washing machines, free LPG cylinders and cash doles of ₹1,000 to ₹1,500 for women head of families. In the past, the parties tempted them with free mixers, grinders and gold mangalsutra for marriage. But, this time, it could take much more than populism to convince them. G Krithika, a BTech (IT) student, is still struggling to find placement because Covid pandemic-hit companies are going slow on hiring. She blames the government for the “poor education system that is not conducive to industry requirements”. Tamil Nadu Assembly elections 2021: Live updatesWomen safety is as big a concern for women voters. If parties are prioritising women safety as their core issue, the lack of it is being intensely debated. “The government has failed to protect women or girl children. The Pollachi sex scam is a testament. Instead of punishing the offenders, the government is protecting them,” said DMK leader Subbulakshmi Jagadeesan. But her rivals point to the “uncivilised remarks” of her colleagues, including Lok Sabha MP A Raja, against chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami’s mother that had women in Salem seething in anger and disappointed many.

Her exit created a vacuum, forcing them to look around and make a choice.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); “In the LS polls, they attributed their problems to the BJP and the Centre, which was not untrue after demonetisation, GST, and consequent job and income losses.

The state government, however, ruled out closure of schools and colleges and decided to go ahead with offline exams for Classes1 to 9 and board examinations as well. It also said RT-PCR Covid-negative certificate is mandatory only for travellers from Maharashtra and Kerala, not others. CM BS Yediyurappa, who reviewed the Covid-19 situation in Bengaluru and major districts with senior ministers and officials, said no gathering in the name of protests and demonstrations will be allowed in the state for a fortnight, and strict measures will be taken to enforce crowd control at marriages and other events. On Monday, Karnataka reported 2,792 fresh cases. Covid -ve certificate must only for travellers from Kerala, MahaWith 2,792 fresh cases, the number of active cases increased to 23,849. Sixteen Covid-related deaths were also reported. Asked about political rallies before by-elections, he said, “we will not allow big gatherings, and strict instructions will be given in this regard too”. According to CMO officials, political rallies — one of which will be attended by the CM on Tuesday — will be restricted to 500 people. “These limitations will be notified by the health department on Tuesday,” an official said. Though health minister K Sudhakar had sought closure of schools and colleges, sources said education minister S Suresh Kumar insisted that online classes and exams were “impractical” due to the limited reach of internet in the state. “Those recommending online exams and schooling have limited knowledge of how government and BBMP schools are functioning” a senior official quoted Kumar as saying at the meeting. “We did have a discussion on whether examinations have to be conducted or not, and decided to go ahead as per the calendar of events. However, we will hold another review meeting in the next 2-3 days and take a final call,” Kumar told TOI after the meeting. On travel restrictions, it was clarified that a Covid negative certificate is mandated only for travellers from Kerala and Maharashtra. “Considering business travellers coming from across the country, a Covid-negative certificate has been mandated only for those coming from Kerala and Maharashtra. Visitors from other states need not secure a Covid-negative certificate if their trip is only for a couple of days of business travel,” said a CMO official. Citing a surge in cases, the CM appealed to people to stick to Covid safety protocol by wearing masks and maintaining social distancing. Yediyurappa said Covid cases are rising in Bengaluru at an alarming rate, which is a cause of concern. “The daily average of cases is around 1,377 and positive cases are 16,921 in the last 14 days,” Yediyurappa said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/schools-colleges-to-remain-open-in-karnataka-exams-will-be-offline/articleshow/81751273.cms||---

The 30-share BSE index was trading 510.31 points or 1.04 per cent higher at 49,518.81, and the broader NSE Nifty surged 162.70 points or 1.12 per cent to 14,670. HUL was the top gainer in the sensex pack, rising over 3 per cent, followed by Titan, NTPC, ONGC, Dr Reddy's, Nestle India, PowerGrid, HDFC twins and ICICI Bank. On the other hand, M&M was the sole laggard. Domestic financial markets were closed on Monday for Holi. In the previous session on Friday, the sensex surged 568.38 points or 1.17 per cent to finish at 49,008.50, and Nifty climbed 182.40 points or 1.27 per cent to 14,507.30. Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) were net sellers in the capital market as they offloaded shares worth Rs 50.13 crore on Friday, as per exchange data. Market opened on a positive note on Tuesday tracking positive cues from Asian markets, traders said. "Sharp decline in FII selling coupled with large buying by domestic institutional investors (DIIs) can support the market and even take it higher. "But there are many concerns like surge in Covid-19 cases, particularly in economically crucial Maharashtra, appreciation in US 10-year bond yield above 1.7 per cent and the dollar index moving up to 92.8 levels,” said V K Vijayakumar, chief investment strategist at Geojit Financial Services. Elsewhere in Asia, bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Seoul were trading on a positive note in mid-session deals, while Tokyo was in the red. Stock exchanges on Wall Street ended with losses in overnight trade amid worries over the impact of a default by a US-based hedge fund on margin calls last week. Meanwhile, the global oil benchmark Brent crude was trading 0.18 per cent higher at $65.04 per barrel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sensex-rallies-over-500-points-nifty-tops-14650/articleshow/81753065.cms||---

The 33-year-old Tamil Nadu shooter was referring to the upcoming state assembly elections where he will campaign for his mother --- Sarubala Tondaiman -- who is contesting from the Srirangam constituency on an AMMK ticket. Prithviraj has little time to celebrate his maiden gold at a World Cup as he heads to Srirangam.  “Due to my national commitments, I couldn’t spend much time canvassing, but I will do now. My shooting sessions will take a break as I will be on the campaign duty from Tuesday,” Prithviraj told TOI. Despite being part of two shooting World Cups, in Cairo and New Delhi, in the last one month, Prithvi remained in constant touch with his mother.  “She will discuss the day-to-day schedule with me and I will give my inputs wherever it is needed. In her election campaigns in 2016 and 2019, I was handling booth committees. I will be donning the same role this time,” Prithviraj said. He will hit the ground running by meeting key decision-makers in Srirangam in the first few days and follow that up with door-to-door campaigns in the constituency. “My mother is a known face here as she was the Trichy mayor twice. This constituency has a lot of significance since our late chief minister J Jayalalithaa had contested and won assembly elections from Srirangam. AMMK general secretary TTV Dhinakaran wanted a woman candidate to contest from this seat and chose my mother,” he said. Prithviraj will have his younger sister and fellow trap shooter Radha Niranjani for company during the campaign. “Radha was taking part in the South Zone shooting event where she won a gold. She has great oratory skills which will be of immense help for my mother. My work will be at the backend. The last few days are crucial in any election campaign,” Prithviraj mentioned. Does he see himself taking the plunge into politics? “Not at the moment since I am an active shooter but once my career concludes --- I may think about it,” is all that the marksman was willing to state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/after-big-win-tamil-nadu-shooter-prithviraj-shifts-aim-to-mothers-poll-run/articleshow/81753335.cms||Prasad RS
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu assembly elections: Rivals play ‘son of soil’ card in Thirumangalam||RB Udayakumar, minister for revenue, disaster management and IT, has been well connected with his constituency Thirumangalam. He has to his credit implementing welfare schemes besides bringing in AIIMS, Satellite Town Thoppur, he tells Padmini Sivarajah.What have you done for the people of your constituency for the past five years?There are many projects such as AIIMS for Madurai, the Satellite Town in Thoppur, Thirumangalam bus stand, and the Railway overhead bridge to name a few. Work on these projects are still on; land has been acquired and allotted for them. I have also paid attention to the basic requirements of my people such as drinking water, and roads. We cancelled the government order on land acquisition for the SIDCO industrial estate and returned the land to farmers. Bronze statues for Marudhupandiar in Sivarakottai, a statue for Mookaiah Thevar in Usilampatti and a temple for Amma are a few other demands and projects I have fulfilled, to list out a few. What work do you plan to take up if re-elected?Land acquisition has been completed for road widening work between Thirumangalam and Rajapalayam. It is a scheme that would bring development to the entire region and I plan to ensure it is seen through. What are you promising your electors this time?One of my main assurances is that I would take initiative to provide jobs to the youths in the segment — one job for each household. Construction of a dam in Kurayoor to bring water to all the tanks in the region is also on the prime agenda. What do you consider your strengths and what are your weaknesses?I have served all people paying no attention to caste, creed and political affiliations during the past five years. I have ensured that people in my constituency were looked after during the Covid-19 crisis. I do not have any specific weakness, but it is disheartening to see a few people trying to confuse the electorate by spreading rumours just for the sake of votes. Rival points to his strong family legacy, is sure of winning by 40,000 votesOpposing the minister and contesting the seat for the second time is DMK south district secretary M Manimaran , who tells Padmini Sivarajah that he is sure of a win with a margin of more than 40,000 votes, as the DMK has stayed connected to the people for the past ten years.You are not new to the constituency, but do you think defeating R B Udhayakumar is possible?I view Udhayakumar only as an AIADMK candidate. Even stalwarts such as Kalaignar Karunanidhi and J Jayalalithaa have had candidates like me taking them on in elections. I am contesting this seat for the second time (first was in 2011), I am sure I will win with a margin of more than 40,000 votes. The minister says he has fulfilled demands of infrastructure facilities, as a resident of Thirumangalam, what is your take on this?It would be better if the minister proved his claims. Many parts of the constituency are plagued by lack of underground drainage connections. Drinking water problem is there in almost all the villages. There are villages that do not have bus connectivity. With three portfolios, Udhayakumar could have made this constituency a heaven on earth, but it was not done. What are your strengths and weaknesses?My leader Stalin is my biggest strength. Unlike Udhayakumar, I am a son of the soil. I am Sedapatti Muthiah’s son, and we have the track record of being a family that has done many good things for the region and we have around 20,000 assured voters. Thirumangalam is going to be a constituency in the DMK’s kitty this time. I have no weakness in terms of this constituency. This is a constituency with a big mukulathor vote bank; do you think this is another factor that would help you?There are people of all castes, pillaimar, mukulathor, naidus, muthuraiyar and others. The constituency has 400 villages, two town panchayats and a municipality. I have the support of all communities. People are not ready to believe the lies that the minister is telling them about the reservation for vanniyars.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-assembly-elections-rivals-play-son-of-soil-card-in-thirumangalam/articleshow/81753347.cms||---

In a tweet on Monday evening, the President wrote: "I have tested positive for Covid-19... Had 1st dose of vaccine, but antibodies start developing after 2nd dose that was due in a week. Please continue to be careful." Also taking to Twitter, the President's wife Samina Alvi, who had also received the jab on March 16 along with her husband, confirmed that she has tested negative and quarantining. "We had our vaccine 1st dose done but it takes time to build immunity & I request everyone to please continue to get vaccinations done & practice SOPs," she added in the tweet. On March 20, Prime Minister Imran Khan tested positive for the virus, just two days after he was vaccinated. President Alvi and Khan were administered the Chinese vaccine, Sinopharm. Pakistan is currently facing a third wave of the pandemic and the national positivity rate on Monday was recorded over 11 per cent whereas individual positivity rate of some of the districts was recorded higher than 20 per cent, according to the country's National Command and Operation Center (NCOC).

---||World||Joe Biden, CDC director warn of virus rebound if nation lets up||WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden and a top health official warned that too many Americans are declaring virus victory too quickly, appealing for mask requirements and other restrictions to be maintained or restored to stave off a "fourth surge" of Covid-19. The head of the CDC said she had a feeling of "impending doom" if people keep easing off. The double dose of warnings on Monday came even as Biden laid out hopeful new steps to expand coronavirus vaccinations, with all adults to become eligible over the next five weeks. Biden announced plans to expand the number of retail pharmacies that are administering vaccines, and investments to help Americans get to vaccination sites. But the optimism was tempered by stark warnings about the potential for another wave of cases. "This is deadly serious," Biden said, urging governors to reinstate mask mandates and other restrictions that some states have been easing. Hours earlier, during a virtual White House health briefing, Dr Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, grew emotional as she reflected on her experience treating Covid-19 patients who are alone at the end of their lives. "We have so much to look forward to, so much promise and potential of where we are and so much reason for hope," she said. "But right now, I'm scared, I'm going to lose the script, and I'm going to reflect on the recurring feeling I have of impending doom." Cases of the virus are up about 10% over the past week from the previous week, to about 60,000 cases per day, with both hospitalizations and deaths ticking up as well, Walensky said. She warned that without immediate action the US could follow European countries into another spike in cases and suffer needless deaths. "I have to share the truth, and I have to hope and trust you will listen," she said. Later on Monday, Biden addressed the nation from the White House, declaring, "If we let our guard down now, we can see the virus getting worse, not better. People are letting up on precautions, which is a very bad thing." Biden delivered a direct appeal to governors, state and local leaders to reinstate mask-wearing requirements if they have lifted them, and said he encouraged leaders to pause plans to further ease virus-related restrictions. "Please, this is not politics, reinstate the mandate if you let it down," he said. Biden announced that by April 19 at least 90% of the adult US population would be eligible for vaccination — and would have access to a vaccination site within 5 miles of home. Quick vaccination would still depend on supply. Biden had previously directed that all states make all adults eligible for vaccination by May 1, but many have moved to lift eligibility requirements sooner in anticipation of supply increases. Meanwhile, the White House is moving to double the number of pharmacies participating in the federal retail pharmacy program — it has emerged as among the most efficient avenues for administering vaccines — and increase the number of doses for them to deliver. Retail pharmacies are located relatively close to most Americans and have experience delivering vaccines like flu shots. Biden announced that the US is expecting delivery of 33 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine this week — including 11 million of the single-dose Johnson and Johnson shot. More than 1 in 5 adults and nearly 50% of senior American are fully vaccinated, according to data from the CDC. On Thursday, the US set new single-day record for shots in arms: more than 3.2 million. "Now is not the time to let down," Biden said. "Now's not the time to celebrate. It is time to do what we do best as a country: our duty, our jobs, take care of one another. Fight to the finish. Don't let up now" he added. Walensky and Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, appealed to elected officials, community leaders and everyday Americans to maintain social distancing measures and mask wearing. "We are doing things prematurely," Fauci said, referring to moves to ease up on restrictions. Walensky appealed to Americans, "Just please hold on a little while longer." She added, "We are not powerless, we can change this trajectory of the pandemic." Walensky pointed to an uptick in travel and loosening virus restrictions for the increase in cases. "People want to be done with this. I, too, want to be done with this," she said. "We've seen surges after every single holiday," she reiterated. "Please limit travel to essential travel for the time being", she said. The White House, meanwhile is ruling out the creation of a national "vaccine passport" for Americans to verify their immunization status, saying it is leaving it to the private sector to develop a system for people show they've been vaccinated. Some other countries are establishing national databases to allow vaccinated people to resume normal activities. "We do know that there is a segment of the population that is concerned that the government will play too heavy-handed of a role in monitoring their vaccinations," said White House Covid-19 adviser Andy Slavitt. He said officials are worried that "it would discourage people" from getting vaccinated if the federal government was involved. The administration, instead, is developing guidelines for such passports, touching on privacy, accuracy and equity, but the White House has not said when those guidelines will be ready.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/joe-biden-cdc-director-warn-of-virus-rebound-if-nation-lets-up/articleshow/81753535.cms||---
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu assembly polls: Despite two-time win, BJP’s face finds going tough in Tirunelveli||Much before the alliance talks were concluded with the AIADMK and Tirunelveli constituency was allotted to the BJP, the party’s state vice president Nainar Nagendran filed his nomination papers in the segment, sans Form B that gives him ‘lotus’ symbol. Leaders of the BJP are tight-lipped as to whether Nagendran was merely sticking to an auspicious time for filing nominations or whether his objective was to pre-empt the AIADMK from taking the seat for itself or the BJP from fielding someone else. Dust has settled for now and Nagendran is the official candidate of the AIADMK-BJP front. A two-time MLA of the constituency and a former minister (2001-2006), Nagendran is a popular thevar face. Still, his electoral battles have had close finishes. He won by a slender margin of 722 votes in 2001 against DMK’s A L Subramanian, but lost by 606 votes to DMK’s Malai Raja in 2006. In 2011 alone, he managed a comfortable margin of 38,491 votes against Subramanian’s son Lakshmanan, thanks to a formidable alliance, especially with the Puthiya Thamizhagam, which had a significant vote share in the constituency then. But Jayalalithaa denied him ministership owing to his association with T T V Dhinakaran. He lost to A L S Lakshmanan by 601 votes in the last election. This is the third direct contest between Nagendran and Lakshmanan. He made a half-hearted attempt to stay loyal to Dhinakaran after Jayalalithaa’s death. Changing fortunes of V K Sasikala’s nephew prompted Nagendran to look for greener pastures. He finally landed in the BJP. Tirunelveli has not stayed with any one party. It elected AIADMK candidates seven times and DMK six times. It was a one-time stronghold of the Congress. Former CM M Karunanidhi came with a quirky idea to break the backbone of the Congress. His idea was to finish off a private lodge, which was considered the hub of all Congress activities, and he made use of a demand for a railway overbridge to achieve it. Since a single tier bridge would not have achieved his goal, the modernday Chanakya decided to make it a double-decker bridge. Thus, Tirunelveli got Asia’s first double-decker bridge in 1972. The lodge got eclipsed by the flyover and the Congress crumbled too. But successive AIADMK and DMK governments did nothing for the constituency, other than setting up M S University. With narrow roads, people and vehicles jostle for space. Coming back to the present contest, AIADMK workers are not enthused about working for a BJP candidate. The candidature of AMMK’s principal candidate Pal Kannan, a yadava, was rejected as two of his proposers were from other segments. DMK circles say it was a ploy by Nagendran to avoid splitting pro-AIADMK votes. The AMMK has now fielded Ramesh Kannan. Sitting MLA Lakshmanan, like his father, banks on pillai votes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-assembly-polls-despite-two-time-win-bjps-face-finds-going-tough-in-tirunelveli/articleshow/81753913.cms||M K Ananth
---||Business||Missed your turn? 'Recalculate' your career route||NEW YORK: “Recalculating,” as the GPS often tells us when we are driving, may be our best career strategy after a year of uncertainty. Roadblocks or jams may lie ahead, but the route could be more scenic with twists and turns. Maybe another destination would even be better than the one we had planned. Lindsey Pollak, author of “Recalculating: Navigate Your Career Through the Changing World of Work,” discussed with Reuters how to adapt and thrive when life is unpredictable. Q: Why did this image of a “recalculating” GPS resonate so much with you?A: This image popped into my head last March. We were all on a path, and suddenly we weren’t on that path anymore. So I started to think about how we were all in our cars, with the GPS saying “recalculating.” That actually made me optimistic, because I realized there are always different ways to get to where you’re headed. Q: What are the key strategies for tackling this new path?A: There are five rules. Embrace creativity. Prioritize action. Control what you can. Know your non-negotiables. And ask for help, because you don’t have to go it alone. Q: Why is mindset so important?A: We are all inundated with negative information right now, because of the pandemic and social media. But that doesn’t really serve your goals. You have to focus on your life and your job search. It’s really important to take care of yourself and tune out negativity. You have to believe a goal is possible, in order to move forward. Q: The traditional career image is that of a “ladder,” but does that not really apply anymore?A: Most people are tied to the idea that they have to move up or forward, but I wanted to bust that myth. Think of other images, like a “Ferris wheel,” which is always rotating; or a “portfolio” career, which includes a lot of different elements; or a “lattice” career, which can go in many directions. Q: Why is defining one’s “personal story” so critical for job seekers?A: You have your resume, but that only tells part of the story. Hiring managers might make their own assumptions. So you have to tell people how you want to be seen, and pull that together for them. In terms of a LinkedIn profile, for instance, you need to write your own “headline,” or a statement at the top. That’s where you put your stake in the ground, and make sure it’s how you want to be seen. In terms of a photo, dress as you would for the most important job interview of your life. In terms of networking, many people are reluctant to reach out. But that’s why people are on LinkedIn. It doesn’t mean they’ll say yes to everything, but it’s an open invitation, and am amazing opportunity to connect with people who could support you. Q: In this isolated era, has effective networking become a lot harder?A: People don’t like to network because they think it’s asking for help. So offer help instead. “Is there anything I can do for you?” Network with other job seekers, too, because you can all help each other. In a remote environment, networking is easier and harder at the same time. It’s harder because you can’t see people in person and meet up for coffee. But it’s easier because some people have more time and availability to make connections. I like to ask for short amounts of time. Many people will say no, but some will say yes, and it’s so helpful that it’s always worth the effort. Q: How has the interviewing process been altered?A. That’s probably the biggest change of all. Interviews are taking place remotely now, and a lot of that is going to stay. You have to get good at that; there’s just no way around it. Get comfortable looking into the camera, practice with the technology, and make sure the background looks appropriate. These are absolutely learnable skills. Q: What is your take on the job market?A: I am hopeful about what lies ahead. But the burden is on the job seeker to do the work. You have to pivot, and reskill, and figure out how to manage your time and stress levels. None of this is easy, but the opportunities will come for people who want them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/missed-your-turn-recalculate-your-career-route/articleshow/81753931.cms||---

They have now began to target locked houses in the suburban parts of the city. At Maduravoyal, burglars escaped with 25 sovereign gold jewellery and nearly ₹2 lakh from the locked houses when the families were away, police said. Ramachandran, 60, of 19th Street, Ashtalakshmi Nagar, had gone to Tirukadaiyur temple in view of his birthday on Saturday. When one of his neighbours checked his house on Monday morning, they found the main door of the house broken and an almirah ransacked.

Asked about the meeting, Raut initially said, "Why worry? Can't a senior MP meet the home minister?" By 2pm on Monday, however, he had put out a tweet categorically denying any such secret meeting had taken place. Patil, on the other hand, said, "A meeting does not necessarily have to be to discuss politics. It can go beyond politics." Though NCP has denied the meeting took place, the buzz has gained traction as it comes amid tensions in the Maha Vikas Aghadi over controversies the state government is embroiled in. Read AlsoBuzz of Pawar-Shah meet adds spice to Maharashtra sagaAmit Shah as well as Sharad Pawar and Praful Patel happened to be in Ahmedabad on Saturday but there was no clarity on whether they met. The development came as tensions sparked by the sensational plot to extort money from industrialist Mukesh Ambani escalated among constituents of MVA.Raut had in his column in the Sena mouthpiece Saamna on Sunday called NCP's Anil Deshmukh an "accidental home minister," and tensions between NCP and Sena have been escalating ever since the MVA government has been at the receiving end of opposition attacks after a car laden with explosives was found outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani's house, the murder of Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran, the arrest of disgraced cop Sachin Waze and allegations of extortion and corruption made by former city police chief Param Bir Singh against Deshmukh. Read AlsoEverything can't be made public: Amit Shah on his 'meeting' with NCP supremo Sharad PawarUnion home minister Amit Shah on Sunday refused to confirm reports of his meeting with NCP chief Sharad Pawar, saying "everything cannot be made public". Gujarati media had reported that Shah met Pawar and senior NCP leader Praful Patel in Ahmedabad. The report comes amid fresh political turmoil inThe unease over Raut's criticism of Deshmukh also deepened on Monday with leaders of both Congress and NCP saying he had "exceeded his brief" and Congress minister Balasaheb Thorat saying his party would bring the matter to the notice of CM Uddhav Thackeray. Raut had, among other things, written that the MVA government had no mechanism for damage control and thus had faced huge embarrassment after Singh alleged Deshmukh had given Waze a target of mobilizing Rs 100 every month. Thorat, who is revenue minister, said, "Raut's comments are uncalled for and in bad taste. We will take it up with the CM."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pawar-shah-meeting-rumours-swirl-despite-ncp-raut-denial/articleshow/81750348.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

The warning included both Dubai and Abu Dhabi in the UAE as well as Bahrain. Both Gulf Arab countries established diplomatic ties with Israel last year under historic U.S.-brokered agreements. “We estimate that Iran will continue to operate in the near future to harm Israeli targets,” the agency's anti-terrorism office said in a statement. It identified Georgia, Azerbaijan, Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Bahrain, the Kurdish region of Iraq, as well as Turkey, Jordan and Egypt as areas to avoid. After establishing ties with Israel last year, the UAE became a popular destination for Israeli tourists, even after a similar travel advisory was issued. The coronavirus pandemic halted most travel. But after a successful vaccination campaign, Israel has begun to reopen its economy and expects tourism to pick up steam in the coming months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/israel-urges-citizens-to-avoid-uae-citing-iranian-threat/articleshow/81754008.cms||---

Last year, during the first wave of Covid-19, when the containment rules were brought in, GCC used to publish the list of streets under containment everyday giving residents a clear idea about the roads they could and could not visit. However, no such list of streets is being currently published. A senior official said this is because no streets have been declared as containment zones right now. Currently, GCC classifies any street which has more than three index cases as a containment zone. “A majority of cases we are witnessing is only in apartment homes. We are yet to come across any such streets where there is a cluster of cases and hence no street has been barricaded as such,” said a senior GCC official. When such houses with multiple cases are identified, a warning symbol using vinyl banners is used, the official added. A zonal level official also confirmed this, adding that cases were spread out, unlike during the first wave where there were many clusters. As on Monday morning, the city has 5,198 active cases. The number of streets where cases have been recorded are 419. Most streets where Covid-19 cases are being recorded are in apartment complexes in middle and high income areas of the city. Only two zones in the city now have less than 100 cases; Tiruvottiyur and Manali, which have 95 and 65 active cases respectively. Teynampet (617), Anna Nagar (580) and Kodambakkam (533) have the highest number active cases in the city, while Thiru-vi-ka Nagar (483), Royapuram (470) and Ambattur (471) also have a high number of active cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/spike-in-covid-cases-yet-no-information-on-containment-areas-in-chennai/articleshow/81754015.cms||---

However, sales at the market showed that the government need not have worried. The revenue from sales at the Byadagi chilli market in Haveri comfortably surpassed the conservative target that the state government had set. Against a target of Rs 9.5 crore set for the 2020-21 fiscal year, sales at the market touched this year have already crossed Rs 12 crore. This is the third time in a row that sales at the market in Byadagi have successfully breached the target. Last year, the market registered sales of up to Rs 19 crore, when the target that the government had set was only Rs 15 crore. This year, stakeholders have attributed the impressive sales at the market to the reduction in agriculture produce market committee (APMC) cess from the previous 1.5% to 0.6%. The uptick in the price of Byadagi Chilli – one tonne of the crop was sold for a record price of Rs 75,000 – has understandably kept farmers engaged in the cultivation of the crop in buoyant spirits. In all, the Byadagi chilli market has recorded a turnover of Rs 1,997 crore in the 2020-21 fiscal year, against Rs 1,260 crore that was registered in 2019-20. Sales of Byadagi Chilli pushed the revenue upwards, with more than 11,000 quintals of the crop being sold thus far in the current financial year. Byadagi chilli market assistant secretary Shrikant Guled expressed his delight at the impressive profit that many farmers from across North Karnataka – Haveri, Gadag, Dharwad, Ballari and Raichur districts – had registered. “In fact, farmers from neighbouring Andhra Pradesh who came to the market also returned home happy. They reaped a bumper harvest,” he added. A trader at the Byadagi chilli market, however, pointed to the need for improving the condition of the road from the market to Byadagi town. “The project to widen the road has been hanging fire for many years. The state government must allocate enough funds to improve infrastructure around the market,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/karnataka-byadagi-chilli-breaches-target/articleshow/81754090.cms||Basavaraj Maralihalli

---||Business||UK ministers reject Sanjeev Gupta's bailout plea: Report||NEW DELHI: British ministers have rejected a request from mining magnate Sanjeev Gupta for a 170 million pound emergency loan to prevent his group, GFG Alliance, from collapsing, the Financial Times reported on Sunday. The FT said Gupta was working on plans to raise new loans against parts of the group outside the UK, adding that he also aimed to generate cash from an expedited sale of goods. GFG, a holding company for Gupta's assets, was the biggest recipient of financing from Greensill, a British financing company that filed for insolvency this month. The British government wrote back to Gupta formally rejecting the request last week due to multiple concerns, the FT reported, citing people familiar with the situation. GFG and the government did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the report. The conglomerate had been in talks with administrators of its former financial backer Greensill on a so-called standstill agreement. Last week, Reuters reported that GFG had secured a loan from Trafigura in 2018 by agreeing a six-year deal to sell aluminium to the commodity trader at a discount to market prices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/uk-ministers-reject-sanjeev-guptas-bailout-plea-report/articleshow/81754302.cms||---

---||Business||India's steady recovery thrown in doubt by spike in coronavirus cases||NEW DELHI: India’s consumption demand and business activity looked steady in February, although chances of a strong recovery appeared doubtful after a sharp surge in virus cases and the increasing risk of renewed lockdowns. The dial on a gauge measuring so-called animal spirits showed activity cruising at a steady pace for the fifth straight month, with all eight high-frequency indicators tracked by Bloomberg News holding their ground last month. The number was arrived at by using the three-month weighted average to smooth out volatility in the single-month scores. Coronavirus: Live updatesThe February reading reflects gains in the economy at a time when virus cases were on the wane. However, the recent weeks have seen the trend reverse, raising the specter of localised lockdowns that could hit consumer mobility and demand in an economy where consumption makes up some 60% of gross domestic product. While central bank governor Shaktikanta Das has said he doesn’t see any immediate threat to activity, economists see a bumpy road ahead given that the western Indian state of Maharashtra, which contributes 14.5% to the country’s overall GDP, is among the worst hit and accounts for the majority of cases. The state, which includes Mumbai, has imposed a night curfew to tamp down cases that have been rising since mid-February. Business activityActivity in India’s dominant services sector expanded at its quickest pace in a year in February, helped by an increase in new orders and optimism generated by a roll-out of vaccines. The IHS Markit India Services Purchasing Managers’ Index rose to 55.3 last month from 52.8 in January, with a reading above 50 signaling expansion. A similar survey earlier showed activity in the manufacturing sector also expanded, helping lift the composite index to a four-month high of 57.3 last month. As a result, input price inflation quickened, pushing the aggregate rate of cost inflation to an 88-month high -- a wrinkle for the nation’s inflation-targeting monetary policy makers who meet early next month to decide on interest rates. ExportsExports were up 0.7% year-on-year last month, slower than the 6.2% rise seen in January. More importantly, imports rose 7% as non-oil and non-gold imports saw robust growth, mirroring domestic demand. Consumer activityPassenger vehicle sales, a key indicator of demand, rose nearly 18% in February from a year ago, with two-wheelers and tractor sales leading the pack. Demand for loans picked up. Bank credit grew around 6.6% in February from a year earlier, faster than the 5.9% rise seen in late January, central bank data showed. Liquidity conditions were little changed. Bloomberg Economics’ Abhishek Gupta said a pullback in surplus liquidity, as well as rising yields, pose a risk to loan demand. Industrial activityIndustrial production contracted 1.6% in January from a year earlier. Consumer non-durables, comprising essential goods, contracted 6.8% in January, while demand for white goods and mobile phones shrank 0.2%. Output at infrastructure industries, which makes up 40% of the industrial production index, rose 0.1% in January from a year ago, after a 1.3% contraction in December. Both data are published with a one-month lag.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/indias-steady-recovery-thrown-in-doubt-by-spike-in-coronavirus-cases/articleshow/81754326.cms||---

---||India||UNSC needs to introspect about the cost of its 'actions and inactions' on Syria: India||UNITED NATIONS: The UN Security Council needs to introspect about the cost of its "actions and inactions" on Syria, India has said, emphasising that the powerful organ of the world body cannot afford to be "unmoved" on the urgent need to build consensus and work collectively to end the sufferings of the people in the war-torn country. Speaking at the Security Council briefing on Syria, chaired by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, India's Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador T S Tirumurti on Monday said the last decade has largely been lost for the Syrians, particularly for the children and youth, who have not been seeing anything but violence and conflict since 2011. "This suffering should certainly move the Council members,” Tirumurti said, asserting that the Council needs to introspect about the cost of its actions and inactions. “There is an urgent need to build consensus on the humanitarian situation and collectively work to ameliorate the sufferings of people in Syria. We cannot afford to be unmoved,” he said. Blinken said the members of the Security Council have a job to do. “Reauthorise all three border crossings for humanitarian assistance to the Syrian people. Stop taking part in – or making excuses for – attacks that close these pathways, and stop targeting humanitarian aid workers and the Syrian civilians they are trying to help. Stop making humanitarian assistance, on which millions of Syrians' lives depend, a political issue, waiting in hope for the Security Council.” He added that the lives of the Syrian people, "depend on us getting urgent help. We have to do everything in our power, to create ways for that aid to get to them, to open pathways, not to close them." Tirumurti added that the decade-long conflict has had a devastating effect on the people of Syria. Expressing deep concern over the alarming statistics, he said an estimated half-million people have died, millions have been displaced, both internally and externally, the health infrastructure has collapsed, and children have been deprived of basic education. “Women, children and youth have especially been deeply impacted. The Covid-19 pandemic has further aggravated the humanitarian situation.” Tirumurti underlined that given the scale, severity and complexity of humanitarian needs, those who advocate linking humanitarian assistance to the political track should revisit the matter immediately. “The politicisation of the humanitarian track does not help anyone, least of all the millions of suffering Syrians,” he said. “What we need immediately is an engagement that is both consistent with Syrian independence, territorial integrity and sovereignty as well as addresses the urgency of the humanitarian issues to alleviate the suffering of the Syrian people.” He emphasised that concrete steps need to be taken to address hurdles that are obstructing the functioning of both cross-border and cross-line operations, in particular, the delays in granting requisite approvals to humanitarian aid convoys. Under Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Mark Lowcock warned that “now is not the moment to reduce humanitarian aid to Syria.” There is need for more money, not less, “if we are to avoid a further deterioration – the consequences of which could be dramatic and widespread.” “Our ability to deliver aid and stave off an even worse situation for millions of civilians will depend on the political will and financial generosity of the international community, including the countries represented in this Council,” he said. Tirumurti noted that the recent flare-up of hostilities in north-west Syria on March 21 is a reminder of the serious impediments to international efforts. India strongly condemned the attack on the surgical hospital in Al Atareb that resulted in the killing of innocent civilians. “We have equally underlined that we cannot allow terrorists to take any further advantage of the situation and the Council should speak in one voice on terrorism. Let us not lose sight to the need to resolutely combat terrorists and terrorist groups,” he said. The UN will be co-hosting the Brussels V Conference in support of Syria and neighbouring countries affected by the crisis Tuesday. India welcomed the conference, saying it remains convinced that efforts towards improving the humanitarian situation in Syria will positively impact the political track as well. Tirumurti told the Council meeting that India has already extended immediate medical assistance and food assistance to Syria recently, in addition to the development cooperation projects, including USD 265 million in soft loans. An artificial limb fitment camp of the well-known “Jaipur Foot” of the Jaipur-based Bhagwan Mahaveer Viklang Sahayata Samiti (BMVSS), conducted in Damascus, benefited over 500 Syrians affected by the conflict. “We had undertaken this Jaipur Foot initiative under the rubric of ‘India For Humanity'. We certainly need humanity now more than ever on the humanitarian crisis facing Syria” Tirumurti said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/unsc-needs-to-introspect-about-the-cost-of-its-actions-and-inactions-on-syria-india/articleshow/81754486.cms||---

The chief minister also said that measures to publish the list of communities which are eligible for EWS reservation are being progressing. In a Facebook post, the CM said there is no base for the allegations that some of the communities will be exempted from the list. On a petition filed by the NSS regarding publication of the list of communities which are eligible for EWS reservation, the Kerala high court has asked to publish the list of the eligible communities, Vijayan said in the post. “There is misleading news that some of the communities will be exempted from the list. Such news items are baseless. All such apprehensions will be over when the government publishes the list. There is a concerted effort to spread misinformation,” Vijayan said. The NSS leadership had alleged that the LDF government has not taken steps to publish the list of communities which are eligible for reservation under the EWS category.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/10-job-reservation-for-ews-is-in-place-says-kerala-cm/articleshow/81754507.cms||---

In the advisory issued to the DCs of Chandel, Tengoupal, Kamjong, Ukhrul and Churachandpur on March 26, Special Secretary (Home) H Gyan Prakash also asked them to stop Aadhaar enrolment exercise. Read AlsoManipur bars Myanmarese entry to India, asks districts to keep vigilLocal officials have been asked not to open any camps to provide food and shelter, the civil society organisations also should not be allowed to open any camps to provide shelter and food, people trying to enter or seek refuge should be politely turned. Aadhaar enrolment should be stoppedAs a fallout of the events taking place in the neighbouring country, Myanmar, it is reported that the country's nationals have been trying to enter India through the border states including Manipur, it said. "District administration should not open any camps to provide food and shelter. The civil society organisations should also not be allowed to open any camps to provide shelter/food," the circular, which came into public domain on Monday, said. While advising the DCs to "politely turn away", those trying to sneak into India, the Special Secretary wrote, in case of grievous injuries, medical attention may be provided on humanitrian considerations. With public anger mounting in neighbouring Mizoram against attempts to thwart the entry of refugees from Myanmar, the officer issued another advisory on Monday, saying the contents of the previous letter had been "misconstrued". "It appears that the contents of the letter have been misconstrued and interpreted differently. The state government has been taking all humanitarian steps had recently taken all steps, including taking them to Imphal, to treat the injured Myanmarese nationals. The state government continues to provide all aid," it said. "In order to avoid this misunderstanding I am directed to convey the decision of the Government that it has decided to withdraw the letter dated 26.03.2021 mentioned above," Prakash said. Mizoram chief minister Zoramthanga had recently written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi urging him to provide asylum to the refugees, saying a "human catastrophe of gigantic proportions" is happening in Myanmar and innocent citizens are being killed by the military, which is supposed to protect them. He had dubbed as "not acceptable" the Centre's order to prevent illegal immigration from Myanmar and ensure speedy deportation of refugees. Zoramthanga said the areas in Myanmar bordering Mizoram are inhabited by the people of Chin community who share ethnic ties and have had close contact with the people of the state even before India became Independent. "This (MHA advisory) is not acceptable to Mizoram. I understand that there are certain foreign policy issues where India needs to proceed cautiously. However, we cannot ignore this humanitarian crisis," Zoramthanga said in the letter. Over 1,000 Myanmarese have taken refuge in Mizoram since the coup, and a senior government official told PTI on Monday that the state had received no communication from the Centre after the March 10 directive to stop illegal immigration from the neighbouring country. An unspecified number of refugees also entered Manipur, including those with injuries, who were sheltered by the residents of border villages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/manipur-govt-asks-dcs-to-politely-turn-away-myanmar-refugees-takes-back-order/articleshow/81754739.cms||---

The Biden administration has been seeking to engage Iran in talks about both sides resuming compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal. The agreement removed economic sanctions on Tehran in return for curbs on Iran's nuclear programme to make it harder to develop a nuclear weapon - an ambition Tehran denies. "A senior Iranian official tells Press TV that Tehran will stop its 20-percent uranium enrichment only if the US lifts ALL its sanctions on Iran first," state-run Press TV said on its website. "The official said Tehran will further reduce its commitments under the 2015 nuclear deal if the US does not lift all sanctions, warning that Washington is rapidly running out of time," it added. Separately, Iran's United Nations mission tweeted: "No proposal is needed for the US to rejoin the JCPOA (nuclear agreement). It only requires a political decision by the US to fully and immediately implement all of its obligations under the accord..." Politico earlier reported a US proposal, the details of which it said are still being worked out, would ask Iran to halt some of its nuclear activities, such as work on advanced centrifuges and the enrichment of uranium to 20% purity, in exchange for some relief from US economic sanctions. US President Joe Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump, withdrew from the deal in 2018 and reimposed US sanctions. Iran, after waiting more than a year, retaliated by violating some of the pact's nuclear restrictions, including a 3.67% limit on the purity to which it can enrich uranium. The odds any progress to revive the deal before Iran holds a presidential election in June have dwindled after Tehran opted to take a tougher stance before returning to talks, officials have said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/iran-rejects-ending-20-enrichment-before-us-lifts-sanctions-report/articleshow/81754859.cms||---

---||World||Probe underway, day after cargo ship freed in Suez Canal||SUEZ: Experts on Tuesday boarded a colossal container ship that had been stuck for nearly a week in the Suez Canal before it was freed as questions swirled about the grounding that had shaken the global shipping industry and clogged one of the world's most vital waterways. The Ever Given was anchored in the Great Bitter Lake, a wide stretch of water halfway between the north and south ends of the canal, after salvage teams succeeded in finally freeing the skyscraper-size vessel on Monday afternoon. The ship, stuck sideways in a narrow stretch of the canal, had halted billions of dollars a day in maritime commerce. A senior canal pilot, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to journalists, told The Associated Press the experts were looking for signs of possible damage and trying to determine the cause of the vessel's grounding. Engineers were examining the engines of the Panama-flagged, Japanese-owned ship hauling goods from Asia to Europe to determine when exactly it can sail to its destination in the Netherlands, he said without elaborating. Ships stacked with containers could be seen from the city of Suez, sailing in the north-bound part of the waterway. Suez Canal service provider Leth Agencies said that over three dozen vessels that had waited for Ever Given to be freed, have already exited the canal into the Red Sea since the waterway was reopened for navigation at 6 p.m. on Monday. The shipowner, Shoei Kisen, said Tuesday that it will be part of the investigation, which would also include other parties, though it did not identify them by name. It also refused to discuss possible causes of the accident, including the alleged high speed and other errors, saying that it cannot comment on the investigation that is still going on. The company added that any damage to the ship was believed to be mostly on the bottom. Shoei Kisen said it was not immediately known whether the vessel will be repaired on site in Egypt or elsewhere, or whether it will eventually head to its initial destination of Rotterdam. That is a decision to be made by its operator, rather than the shipowner, the company said. On Monday, a flotilla of tugboats, helped by the tides, wrenched the bulbous bow of Ever Given from the canal's sandy bank, where it had been firmly lodged since March 23. The tugs blared their horns in jubilation as they guided the Ever Given through the water after days of futility that had captivated the world, drawing scrutiny and social media ridicule. Analysts expect it could take at least another 10 days to clear the backlog on either end of the Suez Canal. The Ever Given had crashed last Tuesday into a bank of a single-lane stretch of the canal about 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) north of the southern entrance, near the city of Suez. That created a massive traffic jam that held up $9 billion a day in global trade and strained supply chains already burdened by the coronavirus pandemic. At least 367 vessels, carrying everything from crude oil to cattle, had backed up to wait to traverse the canal. Dozens of others have taken the long, alternate route around the Cape of Good Hope at Africa's southern tip _ a 5,000-kilometer (3,100-mile) detour that costs ships hundreds of thousands of dollars in fuel and other costs. The canal is a source of national pride and crucial revenue for Egypt, and President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi praised Monday's events after days of silence about the blockage. ``Egyptians have succeeded in ending the crisis,'' he wrote on Facebook, ``despite the massive technical complexity.'' The crisis over the Ever Given had cast a spotlight on the vital trade route that carries over 10% of global trade, including 7% of the world's oil. Over 19,000 ships ferrying Chinese-made consumer goods and millions of barrels of oil and liquified natural gas flow through the artery from the Middle East and Asia to Europe and North America. The unprecedented shutdown, which raised fears of extended delays, goods shortages and rising costs for consumers, has prompted new questions about the shipping industry, an on-demand supplier for a world under pressure from the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/probe-underway-day-after-cargo-ship-freed-in-suez-canal/articleshow/81754967.cms||---

Moreover, 70% of these are more than 20 years old. Karnataka tops the list among states with approximately 70.1 lakh 15-year-old plus vehicles, followed by Uttar Pradesh having nearly 56.5 lakh such vehicles, according to government data. The details submitted by Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari to the Parliament last week show that at least four crore vehicles registered across states are more than 15 years old and nearly 50% of these are older than 20 years. The actual number would be more since this number has been collated from the digitised vehicle data from the central vehicle registration database of Vahan 4.  Moreover, the centralised data doesn’t include the details of three big states — Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Telangana. The details of these vehicles become important in the light of the government’s announcement to mandatorily de-register old vehicles — 15- years-old commercial and 20 -years-old personal vehicles — if they fail to pass the fitness test from June 1, 2024. “Currently, there is no mechanism to de-register vehicles until and unless the owners approach RTOs. So, there may be huge number of unused vehicles which are still in the category of registered vehicles,” said an official. In its bid to discourage people to hold on to their old vehicles, the government has started taking a series of steps including the move to formulate guidelines for imposition of “green tax” on older vehicles by states and UTs. The road transport ministry has circulated the proposal to states and UTs for their comments. It has also issued draft notifications to increase the charges for renewal of registration of personal vehicles and fitness renewal charges for commercial vehicles which are over 15 years. “I’m wondering what could be the reaction of the government on 15-year-old private petrol vehicles that are very well maintained and so would pass the pollution test with flying colours. This proposal is overlooking a sizeable chunk of vehicle owners who fall in this category,” said Geetika Dogra, a vehicle owner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-has-3rd-highest-share-of-15-year-old-vehicles-in-india/articleshow/81755060.cms||Dipak K Dash
---||Bengaluru||Shape up or ship out: Palike ultimatum to officials||BENGALURU: With Covid-19 infections spiralling, BBMP commissioner N Manjunatha Prasad has read the riot act to his health officials. He has told them to either ramp up testing or be ready to receive suspension orders. Addressing a closed-door meeting of Palike officials on Monday, Prasad is said to have told his subordinates that the health department of the civic agency has failed to rise to the occasion. He said officials are focused only on random testing instead of following a planned testing process. This is not only a waste of testing kits, but is also not aiding in containing the pandemic, sources privy to the proceedings quoted Prasad as saying. Prasad blamed rising cases on poor testing of ILI and SARI cases. “Merely collecting swab samples from random people just to push up testing numbers is a waste of time and kits,” he was quoted as saying. Joint commissioners, zonal officers and medical officials were among those present at the meeting. “Private hospitals in the city are testing 40% of ILI and SARI cases they get, while primary health centres (PHCs) and Urban Primary Health Centre (UPHCs) are testing only 5%,” Prasad said. Data shows almost 90,000 people in Bengaluru have been tested in the past 14 days and 46,556 people of them had ILI or SARI. “Testing for ILI and SARI needs to increase to control infections from rising and prevent deaths. Many officials have a laid back approach towards identifying these cases,” Prasad said. Speaking to TOI later, Prasad said, “BBMP doctors are not applying their mind and their approach is wrong.” Referring to the state health department’s earlier orders of testing interstate travellers on the seventh day of their arrival, Prasad directed his team to monitor travellers and test them after a week. “Even if they have RT-PCR negative certificates, travellers could contract the infection during the journey. So, we need to test them on the seventh day, which is rarely done,” Prasad said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/shape-up-or-ship-out-palike-ultimatum-to-officials/articleshow/81755133.cms||Nithya Mandyam

The data, shared in response to Hassan MP Prajwal Revanna, also reveals that 8,996 cattle were killed during the same period. According to the authorities, Kodagu and Hassan have reported the highest number of such conflicts. A tiger had killed three persons in Kodagu recently. Days later, the man-eater was found dead with bullet injury. According to the data, between 2017-18 and 2020-21, 78,705 incidents of crop damage were reported in the state, about 573 persons were injured in animal attacks, about 13 persons sustained permanent disability while 600 properties were damaged in animal attacks. According to principal chief conservator of forests & head of forest force (HoFF) Sanjay Mohan, maximum cases related to human-animal conflict are reported from Kodagu, Hassan and Kolar in South Karnataka. As per the information shared by the ministry, wild animals injured in human-animal conflict are examined by veterinary doctors and if found unfit for release in the wild, are sent to rescue centres of Zoo Authority of Karnataka. Activist Joseph Hoover suspected that the number of deaths/ injuries may be beyond what has been reported. “The elephants are moving out of the forest areas to estates and farm land because the forests are now filled with weeds like lantana and parthenium. In search of food, they visit the estates or farms,” he observed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/man-animal-conflict-in-4-years-145-people-died-in-karnataka/articleshow/81755179.cms||Shrinivasa M

George, who had won as the CPM supported independent during 2014 Parliament election from Idukki, made highly objectionable comments against the Nehru scion while addressing an election rally at Irattayar here on Monday. Distancing himself from the comments, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the LDF's stand is not to personally attack Gandhi. "We will oppose him politically not personally", Vijayan told reporters in Kasaragod on Tuesday. Attacking the opposition Congress-led UDF and Rahul Gandhi in particular, George said Gandhi would visit only women's colleges and the girls should be "cautious" while dealing with the former Congress President. "Girls never bend down in front of him.. he is an unmarried trouble maker," he alleged. The former Left independent MP's remarks came days after Gandhi had given Aikido lessons at the famed St Teresa's college in Kochi based on the request of a student. The Congress leader had visited the women's college for an interaction with students after he arrived at the state for election campaigning. Joyce George's statement drew intense criticism from the Congress fold. Leader of Opposition Ramesh Chennithala on Tuesday termed the sexually coloured remarks against Gandhi as 'unfortunate and unacceptable.' A case should be registered against the former MP and he should be arrested, he said. Member of Parliament and Youth Congress leader Dean Kuriakose lashed out at the ex-MP and said George might have spoken about his own character. "The vulgarity within him has come out now. What is his merit to criticise Rahul Gandhi? He is trying to follow the footsteps of power minister M M Mani, known for making such derogatory comments," he said. Kuriakose said through the comments, the former MP had not only insulted Gandhi but also the girl students. He also said he would soon lodge a complaint with the Election Commission against George in this regard. Criticising George, Kerala Congress leader P J Joseph said the remarks were "immature" and wanted to know whether it was the opinion of the entire LDF. However, minister M M Mani justified George and said he had not made any anti-women remarks and only criticised Rahul Gandhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/kerala/ex-mp-calls-rahul-unmarried-trouble-maker-courts-controversy-in-kerala/articleshow/81755321.cms||---
