PM Narendra Modi of India was among the world leaders to send Khan get-well-soon messages. "Best wishes to Prime Minister @ImranKhanPTI for a speedy recovery from Covid-19," he tweeted. Khan is self-isolating at home, Dr Sultan said. The 68-year-old had got a shot of the Covid vaccine on Thursday. It is likely he was infected prior to being inoculated, officials said. Faisal Javed, a senator of Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), said the PM was experiencing mild symptoms and would continue to work from home over video-conferencing. Khan had been busy attending meetings and public events in recent days. On Friday, he had visited northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where he inaugurated a new academic block of Malakand University and addressed a gathering of students without wearing a mask. Two days ago, he had addressed a security conference in Islamabad that was attended by a large number of people. Pakistan on Saturday reported 3,876 new infections after conducting 40,946 tests – a positivity ratio of 9.47 per cent. This is the highest number of daily infections since July 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/two-days-after-vax-shot-pak-pm-tests-positive/articleshow/81609295.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

The FM also said that PSUs that are being privatised would receive capital infusion and professional management. The FM made the commitment during an interaction following her address to India Inc at the Economic Times Awards for Corporate Excellence. “When we are speaking out privatisation, I do recognise that these units are in the economic activity that is critical for the country. Privatisation is not going to end up being selling for closure, I am selling it to continue to be in business because I cannot run it efficiently and I do not have money of the scale that is needed to invest,” said Sitharaman. “If these two principles are there that the unit will run more efficiently and workers' concerns are addressed by us I am sure I shall be able to convince and take forward the agenda,” said Sitharaman. She said that the principles would apply irrespective of whether the units were profitable or loss-making. The minister's commitment gains significance because the government has proposed to privatise two banks and a non-life insurer, which have employees entitled to a lifelong index-linked pension. The FM in her budget speech last month had unveiled a massive privatisation and asset monetisation plan for PSUs. The government may reduce the number of PSUs over time to just around two dozen from the current over 300 at present, following the new policy that focuses on privatisation in non-core areas while shutting down loss making state run enterprises. Besides inviting the private sector to invest in PSUs, the government is actively engaging with sovereign wealth funds globally to attract capital into the proposed development finance institution (DFI). "We are making sure that we're engaging with sovereign and pension funds of the world so that when we're coming up with DFIs, we'll have great interest,” she said. In her speech, the finance minister said that the growth path of the global economy had turned positive and India’s growth path is being pitched a notch higher with a clear sign of revival not just in manufacturing but in the services sector as well. Several multilateral agencies estimate the Indian economy to grow in double digits in 2021-22 to emerge as the fastest growing major economy after the Covid-19 induced lockdown hurt the economy. It is forecast to contract around 8% in the current fiscal year and rebound next year on the back of measures unveiled by the government to script a turnaround. Sitharaman said that the government's focus on the concept of Atmanirbhar Bharat was not a throwback to socialist India. “I have been very selective about the items on which we have raised tariffs. These are essentially final consumer goods that are manufactured in India, not on intermediaries and raw materials. Import substitution does not blindly stop imports,” the FM said. On the suspension of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code coming to an end, Sitharaman said that the government does not want the withdrawal of the standstill to hurt companies, but at the same time it is aware of the need to return to normalcy. She said that the financial markets upheaval witnessed in 2013 following tapering down of the stimulus in the US would not be repeated. “We and RBI have learned a lot of lessons post the 2013 taper-tantrums. Because there is greater sync between the govt and RBI, we are closely monitoring the situation and there is no risk for India,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/fm-promises-to-protect-rights-and-perks-of-workers-of-privatised-psus/articleshow/81609720.cms||---

The only mention of minorities was by the external affairs minister in the context of Afghanistan,” a high-ranking official said. Lloyd Austin met with foreign minister S Jaishankar for a discussion on the strategic situation in the Indo-Pacific and the peace process in Afghanistan. With reference to Austin’s remarks on human rights, Indian sources said, “The secretary of defence said that as the two largest democracies in the world, human rights and values are important to us and we will lead with these values. EAM (Jaishankar) agreed and emphasised that a strong relationship between the two democracies was not only important for both countries but for the rest of the world.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rights-discussed-only-in-afghanistan-context-indian-officials/articleshow/81609660.cms||---
---||India||Ishrat case: Gujarat refuses CBI sanction to prosecute 3 cops||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat government has refused sanction to prosecute the three accused police officials — IPS officer G L Singhal, retired DSP Tarun Barot and ASI Anaju Chaudhary — in the 2004 Ishrat Jahan fake encounter case, the CBI told a special court here on Saturday. These are the last three of the eight policemen who are facing prosecution for murder, criminal conspiracy, abduction and illegal detention of 19-year old Ishrat Jahan and her companions Javed Shaikh alias Pranesh Pillai, Zeeshan Johar and Amjad Ali Rana, who were shot dead on June 15, 2004, on the outskirts of Ahmedabad in a police encounter. The Ahmedabad crime branch had declared that Ishrat and the three others were Lashkar-e-Taiba operatives who had come to Gujarat to kill then CM Narendra Modi to avenge the 2002 Godhra riots. The refusal of permission suggests that the Gujarat government believes that the shootout was carried out by the police in line of duty, sources said. This has prompted the three cops to file an application to drop the proceedings against them and discharge them from the case. “The court has fixed March 31 for further proceedings,” said Brijrajsinh Jhala, Singhal’s advocate. On October 23, the court had rejected discharge applications filed by the three accused for want of prosecution sanction under Section 197 of the CrPC. Under this section, sanction is required for prosecuting government servants for anything done in the discharge of official duty. The court directed the CBI to obtain the sanction from the competent authority. The Ishrat Jahan encounter case was filed against eight policemen in a sessions court. One of the accused and the complainant J G Parmar died during pendency of the proceedings. A commando, Mohan Kalasava, had died by the time CBI filed the chargesheet. In 2019, retired DIG D G Vanzara and SP N K Amin were discharged from the case after the state government refused to accord prosecution sanction. Before that, the court had discharged former in-charge DGP P P Pandey in this case. The Centre had refused to grant this permission for prosecution sanction in this case for four Intelligence Bureau officials including former special director Rajinder Kumar. Following this, the court had refused to accept the supplementary chargesheet filed against them citing absence of the sanction. Revision applications for accepting the chargesheet and committal of a case were also refused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ishrat-case-gujarat-refuses-cbi-sanction-to-prosecute-3-cops/articleshow/81609880.cms||---
---||India||Incentives for inter-caste marriages may help curb atrocities on Dalits: Parliament panel||NEW DELHI: With inter-caste marriages involving a Dalit spouse rising last year, a parliamentary committee believes that schemes like the one incentivising such wedlocks may be the way to curb the high rate of atrocities against the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The panel’s recommendation comes in the backdrop of the paradox that while there has been an increase in inter-caste marriages involving SCs, crimes against the SCs/STs remain high. As a result, the panel believes that schemes that promote “social integration and harmony and remove practice of untouchability and caste-based discrimination” should be implemented in states where atrocities are high. The central scheme — “incentive for inter-caste marriage” — reported an increase last year. While 17,263 claims were made in 2016-17, it went up to 20,253 in 2017-18 and further up to 23,355 in 2019-20. Under the scheme, cash incentive is provided to every couple in which one spouse is SC. TimesViewThe two recommendations will encourage inter-caste marriage and discourage contractors from being callous, which they often are. But it is equally important to accelerate the pace of social change, which will end such social inequity.The parliamentary standing committee on social justice and empowerment headed by BJP MP Rama Devi, in its report on Demand for Grants for 2021-22, has expressed its dismay at the fact that despite all the laws and programmes to beat the scourge of untouchability, cases of atrocities remain high. Noting that as per NCRB, 2,02,427 atrocity cases against SCs and 33949 cases against STs were registered between 2015-2019, the panel said, “Unfortunately, this figure may actually be higher as several cases go unreported. The committee feel that sincere efforts at the execution level to create awareness as well as sensitise people to come out of their prejudices and bias against the SCs and create an equal society, are urgently required. Some of the states still have a glaring number of atrocity cases despite prevailing laws.” In the context of fighting prejudices against SCs, the panel cited the example of the central scheme that provides cash support for marriage between an SC and a non-SC. “In line with the existing scheme for incentivising inter-caste marriages, more schemes are required to be introduced, particularly by the governments of those states where a very large number of cases (atrocities) are reported, with proper monitoring mechanism to promote social integration and harmony, and remove practice of untouchability and caste-based discrimination,” it recommended.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/incentives-for-inter-caste-marriages-may-help-curb-atrocities-on-dalits-parliament-panel/articleshow/81610036.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal

Of more than 40,000 sites conducting vaccination on Saturday, only 5,507 were in private hospitals, whereas 34,510 sessions were in government hospitals, highlighting the slow pace of expansion in the private sector. Official sources said government is looking into the issue and urging states to take up the matter at district level with private hospitals to understand if they have any issues. "We see there are hospitals on the Co-Win portal that have scheduled some sessions and then have stopped. We need to know why this is happening," an official said. Over 7.26 lakh vaccination sessions have been conducted since January 16 – when the immunization drive was first rolled out - to inoculate more than 4.36 crore people till Saturday 7pm. Currently, around 50,000 hospitals, including both public and private ones, have been enrolled in the vaccination drive. However, government hospitals, still catering to a majority of recipients, account for over 85% of sessions and have also administered significantly higher number of doses at around 70%, whereas less than 30% of total 4.36 crore doses have been given at private hospitals. “Private sector participation is crucial for expansion of the vaccination programme and therefore, the government opted for a liberal policy and allowed 24x7 vaccination sessions as well allowed states to enroll all private hospitals with required infrastructure and facilities for vaccination. Despite this, private sector participation in terms of organizing sessions remains limited,” a senior official said. However, industry executives say there are specific states where the private sector participation has failed to pick up pace because of lack of cooperation from states governments. “The state government concerned has to allow private hospitals and allot sessions because the vaccine stocks are also available accordingly. In many states, the governments have not been approving sessions. We are more than willing to support the drive and have even urged the Prime Minister to ensure that at least 20 million doses are administered every day,” says Giridhar Gyani, Director General, Association of Healthcare Providers (India) . The health ministry has also written to states to involve more private hospitals to accelerate the vaccination programme. It has also asked states to conduct vaccination sessions on more number of days without impacting non-Covid essential medical services. However, private facility participation continues to be low in states like Himachal Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar, Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan. The health ministry and the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC), headed by NITI Aayog member-health Dr VK Paul, are also in dialogue with industry bodies and senior executives of the healthcare industry to evaluate the reasons for low participation of private hospitals, the official said. There are also some private hospitals that are inoculating only walk-in beneficiaries. The decision to allow all private hospitals meeting the required norms in terms of space, cold chain and adverse event monitoring facilities to join the drive was intended to increase footfall for vaccination after the government started inoculating those above 60 years age and those between 45 years and 60 years with specified co-morbidities. Till Saturday 7pm, over 1.7 crore beneficiaries over 60 years and 35.1 lakh people between 45 and 60 years with co-morbidities have received the first dose of the vaccine. Besides, 1.6 crore health and frontline workers have received the first dose, whereas another 73.9 lakh doses have been given as second dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/private-hospitals-going-slow-affecting-vaccine-campaign/articleshow/81610216.cms||Sushmi Dey
---||India||Maharashtra home minister told Sachin Waze to collect Rs 100 crore/month: Ex-Mumbai top cop||MUMBAI: What began as a case of explosives in a car has turned politically explosive. In a sensational twist to the scandal that has snowballed since gelatin sticks were recovered from a Scorpio parked outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence on February 25, just-transferred Mumbai police commissioner Parambir Singh alleged in a letter to CM Uddhav Thackeray that state home minister Anil Deshmukh had set assistant police inspector Sachin Waze “a target to accumulate Rs 100 crore every month”. Singh claimed that to achieve the monthly “target” of Rs 100 crore, Deshmukh told Waze, who was heading the crime intelligence unit, in mid-February that “there are about 1,750 bars, restaurants and other establishments in Mumbai and if a sum of Rs 2-3 lakh each was collected from each of them, a monthly collection of Rs 40-50 crore was achievable”. The rest of the “collection”, Singh quoted Deshmukh as telling Waze, “could be made from other sources”. To support his allegation, Singh enclosed several WhatsApp messages, purportedly between himself and one assistant commissioner of police (Sanjay Patil), dated March 16 and 19. The letter alleging extortion, which was also sent to governor B S Koshyari, plunged the Uddhav Thackeray government into a fresh crisis and could complicate matters within the ruling alliance as Singh said he had, at a late-evening briefing session on the Antilia case at the CM’s official residence Varsha in mid-March, “pointed out several misdeeds and malpractices being indulged into by the Hon’ble Home Minister” and had “similarly briefed” NCP chief Sharad Pawar, deputy CM Ajit Pawar and other senior ministers. Singh said he “noticed that some of the ministers were already aware about some aspects”. Read AlsoParambir Singh’s letter bomb: Will fresh crisis worsen tensions within MVA?Param Bir Singh’s letter to CM Uddhav Thackeray is an indication that the Shiv Sena-led Maha Vikas Aghadi regime, barely 16 months in office, is hurtling from one crisis to another, gravely affecting Maharashtra’s political stability and credibility, said observers.Singh also alleged Deshmukh had forced him to file an abetment to suicide case after Dadra and Nagar Haveli MP Mohan Delkar killed himself in a Mumbai hotel despite “expert legal advice” that Mumbai police didn’t have jurisdiction to do so. While the CMO said they are examining the unsigned letter that did not come from Singh’s listed private email account, Deshmukh rubbished Singh’s charges, saying he was making “false allegations to save and protect himself from legal action”. He added he would file “a defamation case” against Singh.

Singh was shunted out by the CM on Wednesday, apparently on NCP’s insistence, but Sharad Pawar’s party has so far put off demands for Deshmukh’s resignation. Read AlsoWill file defamation case against Parambir Singh, says Maharashtra home ministerHome minister Anil Deshmukh on Saturday called allegations made against him by former police commissioner Parambir Singh as “baseless, false and a conspiracy to save himself and blackmail the government and to deflect attention” from the explosives case and the suspicious death of Mansukh Hiran.Singh said Deshmukh’s instruction to Waze to collect money was made at his official residence Dyaneshwar in the presence of his private secretary Sanjay Palande. “After the meeting, Waze came to my office the same day and informed me of the entire incident. I was shocked,” Singh stated. Opinion: Sachin Vaze shows how shooting stars burn outA few days later, Singh said, ACP Patil, in-charge of the social service branch, too was called by Deshmukh along with DCP Bhujbal to discuss hookah parlours in the city. This meeting was also attended by Palande, who informed Patil and another police office, DCP Bhujbal, that the home minister was “targeting a collection of Rs 40-50 crore, which was possible through 1,750 bars and restaurants operating in Mumbai”. “Patil informed me about the demand made by HM. The aforesaid meeting took place on March 4,” Singh said. Read AlsoAmbani security scare: Explosives would’ve caused ‘low-intensity blast’The ministry of home affairs (MHA) has handed over probe into the murder case of Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran to the National Investigation Agency (NIA). The federal agency has taken over the probe from Maharashtra’s anti-terrorism squad (ATS).In his letter, Singh attached the WhatsApp conversation he had with ACP Patil. “Deshmukh has been repeatedly calling my officers and giving them instructions in respect of the course to be followed by them in performance of their official duties. HM has been calling my officials to his official residence bypassing me and other superior officers. Deshmukh had been explaining to the officers the collection schemes…. these corrupt malpractices have been brought to my notice by the officers,” Singh alleged. On the Delkar suicide case, Singh said as per rules and conventions, the case should have been entrusted to the Nagara Haveli police for further probe, but Deshmukh insisted an abetment to suicide case be registered in Mumbai and announced setting up of a special investigation team. “HM desired that a case of abetment to commit suicide be registered in Mumbai, while the legal view was that all the alleged acts had taken place in Nagara Haveli, as such, it should be probed by the police of the UT,” Singh said. Singh claimed that in his more-than-a-year-long stint as Mumbai CP, “the HM had on several occasions called officers of Mumbai police to his official residence for giving instructions to adopt specific course of action in police investigation. These acts of political interference are illegal and unconstitutional and judicial authorities have come down heavily on such practices.” Deshmukh had said on Thursday that Singh was shifted as DG, home guards, due to serious lapses in the probe into the explosives case. Singh said he had been “made a scapegoat to divert attention from the actual wrongdoers… the observations of the HM against me are all statements contrary to the records and seem to be far extraneous and vindictive”.

---||India||Hosabale new RSS general secretary, takes over from ‘Bhaiyyaji’ Joshi||BENGALURU/NEW DELHI: Dattatreya Hosabale, widely perceived to be more appreciative of the compulsions of BJP leadership and a pragmatic, was elected Sarkaryavah (general secretary) of the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS) in Bengaluru on Saturday, the concluding day of the two-day triennial conclave of top RSS functionaries. He replaced Suresh ‘Bhaiyyaji’ Joshi, 73, who opted to retire on health grounds, after being in that post for four terms of three years each. With his ‘pragmatic’ outlook, Hosabale, 66, popularly known as ‘Dattaji’ in the RSS, is expected to facilitate better co- ordination with the BJP leadership during his tenure which will overlap with the crucial lead up to the 2024 LS polls. He hails from a small village in Shivamogga district of Karnataka and is from a family associated with the Sangh Parivar. In his maiden comments after taking over as the second senior-most functionary of RSS, Hosabale launched into a strong defence of the contentious ‘love jehad’ laws promulgated by BJP governments in states. Another key change effected at the meeting of Akhil Bhartiya Pratinidhi Sabha, the highest decision-making body of the Sangh, was the elevation of Arun Kumar and Ramdutt Chakradhar as Sah Karyawah or joint general secretaries. With this, there will be five joint general secretaries. Krishna Gopal, C R Mukunda and Manmohan Vaidya are the other joint general secretaries. Sunil Ambekar, who not long ago headed BJP’s students’ wing ABVP, will be the new prachar pramukh in place of Arun Kumar. The appointment of Ram Lal as the All India Sampark Pramukh, based in Mumbai, was another important decision. The Sangh also recalled former BJP general secretary Ram Madhav and included him in the national executive. A powerful orator, the erudite Hosabale is second from Karnataka, after HV Sheshadri from Bengaluru, to hold this top position, which is second only to chief Mohan Bhagwat. Significantly, BL Santhosh, also from Karnataka, is second in BJP’s hierarchy after national president JP Nadda. Hosabale is currently based in Lucknow and looks after BJP-RSS coordination. Now, he is being tasked with coordinating over 30 affiliated outfits, including BJP, Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh. Joshi was known to maintain a distance from BJP’s day-to-day affairs, but that may change now. “Dattaji has a good working relationship with the BJP leadership, especially PM Narendra Modi as he had played a key role in the last two Lok Sabha polls and also in the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections in 2017. He shifted his base to Lucknow a year before the polls,” said a senior RSS functionary. He is considered to have a good rapport with home minister Amit Shah too. Hosabale’s name was proposed by regional sanghchalak Ashok Sohoney of Gujarat and endorsed by five other delegates. His name for the post has been doing the rounds since 2015. Hosabale’s elevation is seen as part of the Sangh’s expansion plans south of the Vindhyas, ahead of the 2024 general elections and the RSS’s grand celebrations in its centenary year of 2025, according to Sangh insiders. “Hosabale, one of the joint general secretaries since 2009, will give impetus to RSS growth in states where BJP is aiming to gain a foothold by working closely with Modi and Shah,” said another RSS functionary.

A recent letter from Serum Institute (SII) to at least three countries saying they would not be able to supply vaccines that have been bought by them in the coming months, has raised concerns among many others, about the criteria being used to supply overseas buyers. There is growing disquiet among countries that have been promised vaccines but are yet to receive them. SII chief Adar Poonawalla wrote to Brazil, Morocco and Saudi Arabia that there would be an unspecified delay in sending vaccines that have already been bought. Brazil has received 4 million vaccine doses out of the 20 million ordered. Morocco was among the earliest off the mark, having signed a supply contract for 20 million doses back in August 2020, but has only received 7 million. Saudi Arabia has bought 20 million doses and received 3 million. “… SII had recently signed additional agreements with governments outside the scope of its original sublicense agreement with AstraZeneca. To meet these additional supply commitments, we commenced the expansion of our manufacturing facilities. Regrettably, a fire at one of our buildings has caused obstacles to the expansion of our monthly manufacturing output,” SII said to the head of the Fiocruz Institute, Brazil, invoking ‘force majeure’. Similar letters were sent to the immunisation authorities in Morocco and Saudi Arabia earlier this month. The trouble is, none of these countries, nor others waiting in queue, buy this argument. Poonawalla had categorically stated that the fire in January would not affect vaccine production because the fire was in an under-construction building. Addressing a press conference soon after the incident, Poonawalla had said, "The supply of COVID-19 vaccine will not be affected due to the fire. No actual vaccine was being made at that facility. We were lucky that the incident happened in a different building. The extent of the financial damage is more than Rs 1,000 crores. … The fire has no impact on the production of the Covishield vaccine and no damage has occurred to the existing stock either.” There is growing dissatisfaction that commercial deals with countries who had already paid for the vaccines was not being honoured. “This is becoming a political problem,” said diplomatic sources. Brazil has an average daily death toll close to 3000. They have taken 4 million vaccines from China as well, to meet the growing demand. Brazil’s own vaccine production is expected to kick in only around May. Morocco plans to vaccinate most of its people with the SII-Covishield vaccine, but now finds the pipeline dry, bringing their immunisation program to a halt. Saudi Arabia, one of India’s close strategic partners is also host to almost 2 million Indian expats. In fact, almost 9 million Indians live and work in the Gulf-Middle East countries. Saudi Arabia has received 3 million with no work about the next tranche of vaccine doses. Foreign minister Jaishankar has gone on record to thank Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries for looking after Indian expats during the pandemic lockdowns in 2020. These countries believe its payback time, with vaccines. There is a broad understanding of the fact that India herself has to inoculate a huge number of people, even if the current pace of vaccination is much slower than expected. In February Poonawalla tweeted SII had been asked by the Indian government to prioritise India’s demand, so others would have to wait. Last week, Poonawalla raised the issue of US curbs on exports of critical components for vaccines. That, sources said, was resolved by the government after the Quad meeting. Countries also sympathize with the government’s gesture of gifting vaccines to smaller countries who may not be able to access these quite so soon if it wasn’t for India. India has gifted 81.55 lakh doses; 341.67 lakh doses despatched in commercial sales; 174.99 lakh doses through the Covax programme, adding up to 598.21 lakh doses sent out of India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sii-fails-to-deliver-new-delhis-vaccine-diplomacy-hits-hurdle/articleshow/81610596.cms||Indrani Bagchi

---||India||‘Remote voting’ facility may be launched in 2024 LS polls: CEC||NEW DELHI: Chief election commissioner (CEC) Sunil Arora on Saturday said that ‘remote voting’ facility — enabling persons who cannot be at their polling booths on election day for different reasons, to exercise their franchise from a remote location — may be offered in the 2024 Lok Sabha election, with first pilot project likely to start in the next 2-3 months. “A team of technocrats and experts from IIT Chennai and other IITs is working on it (‘remote voting’ or ‘blockchain’ voting system) in full swing. We hope to see the first pilot project in next 2-3 months,” Arora said in his address at the Sansad Ratna Awards-2021 event here on Saturday. The CEC, who retires next month, added that another key long-term electoral reform EC is hoping to roll out in the next six months to a year is NRI voting. Stating that a proposal to amend the rules to allow NRIs to vote by e-postal ballot was recently sent by EC to the law ministry, the CEC said the commission would, as suggested by the external affairs ministry, hold a seminar with the stakeholders on the modalities, after the current round of assembly polls. Arora also welcomed the recent statement by the law minister that the government was considering EC’s proposal for linkage of Aadhaar with EPIC voter card, adding that this would do away with multiplicity of cards a voter needs to identify himself at the polling station. On remote voting, Arora had earlier told TOI in an interview that EC always stood for promoting greater inclusion for election so that “no voter is left behind”. With technology as a great enabler, the EC started a research project early this year to enable remote voting for those ‘on the move’ including students, patients, professionals, migrant labourers and essential service providers. “It needs to be underscored that the project is neither aimed at internet-based voting nor does it imply voting from home. For the Commission, transparency and confidentiality of voting is always a guiding consideration,” he said adding that there would be process changes and wider consultations with all the stakeholders including political parties before the facility is rolled out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/remote-voting-facility-may-be-launched-in-2024-ls-polls-cec/articleshow/81610870.cms||Bharti Jain

The state of Bihar was carved out from the Bengal presidency in 1912 on this day. The theme for this year’s event is CM Nitish Kumar’s brainchild ‘Jal Jeevan Hariyali’. Keeping in mind the surge of Covid-19 cases in others states, the Bihar Education Project Council (BEPC), the nodal agency for the Bihar Diwas celebrations, has decided to celebrate the event on a small-scale with no cultural events and activities to avoid gatherings.

All DM’s and district education offices will also be connected to the main event,” he said. A painting exhibition on the Jal Jeevan Hariyali theme will be exhibited at Gyan Bhawan by students and faculty members of College of Arts and Crafts, Patna, during the celebration. Sanjay said altogether 50 paintings have been shortlisted for the exhibition. “No other cultural events will be held on Bihar Diwas, however, schools are free to organise any activity if they wish to, following the Covid-19 protocols,” he said. Last year, no event was organised on Bihar Diwas due to the Covid-19 pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-diwas-events-to-be-low-key-affair/articleshow/81608318.cms||---

In August and November 2020, junior doctors had written to government authorities, including the health minister, seeking regularisation of monthly stipends. “Unless we resort to boycotting and agitating, we do not get our due stipends. This has become a regular affair every few months. We work long hours under challenging situations. Some of us are from other states and need stipends to support ourselves and families. We do not want to inconvenience patients and so we will not be boycotting outpatient or emergencies but only elective surgeries till we get our stipends,” said a PG medico from AMC. When contacted, principal of AMC Dr P V Sudhakar said, “Instead of boycotting duties, PG representatives can meet and discuss the issue with government authorities. From the medical college, we have already intimated the officials concerned about the pending stipends. We came to know that the budget has been released a couple of days ago. The bills have been sent to the treasury for verification and the medicos will get their stipend in two to three days.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/pg-medicos-of-amc-boycott-electives-over-stipend-delay/articleshow/81608560.cms||---

With this, senior state health department officials confirmed that Gujarat has recorded a total of 26 cases of foreign Covid-19 strains – UK and South African – in Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara and Kalol. All the patients are discharged, and their contact history is being traced. It was believed that Gujarat had seven-odd foreign strain cases so far but in all 26 patients were detected and have recovered too. “Majority of these patients are identified based on the random testing undertaken by the department where 5% of the confirmed positive samples are sent for genetic profiling randomly. The process is time consuming and results arrive after seven to 10 days of submitting the samples,” said a senior official. The officer added that majority cases had travel history or direct contact with a foreign returned person and cases of local transmission of these strains are few. “We don’t necessarily see the presence of these strains as the reason behind the current surge. It’s more to do with overall change in virus profile and cyclical nature of the pandemic.” Recently the Union government had announced that India had over 400 confirmed cases of foreign strains. As the cases skyrocket in Surat, the city health officials carried out analysis of the patients and found many patients remained asymptomatic for long and triggered more spread. Several patients reported gastrointestinal illness and skin rashes as new symptoms along with coughing, fever and body ache. “The virus is damaging the lungs of the majority of patients without the person even knowing that he/she is infected. These patients are moving around freely and infecting others," Surat municipal commissioner Banchhanidhi Pani told TOI. “Lung involvement is hidden till the patients turn serious. Due to which those being brought to the hospital already have a serious infection in the lungs.” Further, the health authorities are battling asymptomatic cases as well. Among these patients, rapid test results are also proving false. "Couple of my rapid tests turned out negative. But due to a prolonged fever of around six days, I went to the hospital and during a detailed examination, the infection was found in the lungs," said a resident of the City Light area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/26-cases-of-uk-south-african-covid-19-strains-in-guj-so-far/articleshow/81611941.cms||Parth Shastri

Health department says it tracks these patients through video calling on a constant basis. Covid-19 control centre is to once again tag these patients for any violation of guidelines, according to sources. Bhopal chief medical and health officer (CMHO) Dr Prabhakar Tiwari said, “Through regular video calling updates on patient’s medical condition is ensured by the health department.” Bhopal has 1495 active cases which have doubled in past three weeks.

With a high local yield, inputs at the market have increased in the last two days. Mango farmers and traders are expecting handsome profits this year. Mangoes from Nuzividu have a large and ready market across the globe. As many as 34 varieties, including Banginapalli, Thotapur, Chinna Rasalu and Pedda Rasalu, among others, are grown locally. But in 2017-18, mango farmers struggled with crop loss due to the impact of untimely rains and sooty mould. Matters changed from 2019. With abundant rains, mango farmers received a high yield in 2019-20. However, with the Covid-19 outbreak, only a fraction of the yield could be exported and farmers sold their stocks locally at a lower price. An early crop this year has raised hopes. “We hadn’t started exports till April 25 in 2020 due to the Covid-19 lockdown. With restrictions on transport, we had sold fine quality Banginapalli for Rs 32,000 per tonne. But this year traders from Delhi are offering Rs 90,000 per tonne this year,” said K Nagarathna Reddy, a mango trader from Aagiraipalli. Meanwhile, traders from Maharashtra, Punjab and Delhi expressed satisfaction over the quality and price of the fruit. “Nuzividu mangoes have good demand in our region. We regularly come here to buy Banginapalli and Chinna Rasalu. We are exporting three tonnes of mangoes every day presently and will increase the quantity to 20 tonnes by April 1, 2021,” Narinder Singh, a trader from Haryana, told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/with-bumper-yield-mango-cultivators-traders-eye-profit/articleshow/81608547.cms||Venu Lanka

Citing this case as an example, the minister went on to say that some changes have been observed in the strain and “the exact situation will only be known after getting the results of the genome sequencing of 92 swab samples sent from the district”. Raut said the UK variant has over 60% transmissibility, more than the existing one and causes high symptoms. TOI was the only paper to report on March 18 about the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, detecting the UK strain (B.1.1.7) in the swab sample of the 48-year-old woman from Wardha and and acknowledged the strain as a variant of concern (VoC). TOI talked to the woman who recovered and learnt that nine members from her family, including herself, contracted the disease. One family member without any comorbidities died. The woman had mentioned the locality in the city where the family is residing, but TOI had held back the identity. Briefing mediapersons after a review meeting on Saturday, Raut said, “The woman from Wardha came to meet her family members at Manish Nagar. The entire family was affected with the disease. Later, she tested positive. The strain which emerged in Europe was detected in her swab sample,” he said. Raut added that the UK variant is having over 60% transmissibility. “It is learnt that the patient suffers from loose motion, severe body ache and dehydration due to this variant. The entire family gets affected even if one member contracts the disease,” he said. “Results of the swab samples sent from the city to the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), New Delhi, are awaited. We have no information regarding the whereabouts of the samples. We will come to know only after getting the reports from NCDC,” he said. “Union minister Nitin Gadkari also participated in the meeting through video conferencing. I have requested Gadkari to talk to the concerned officials of NCDC and help in getting the results as soon as possible. We can prepare a standard operating procedure (SoP) and line of treatment only after getting the reports from NCDC,” he said. With cases surging in Vidarbha, samples of all districts were sent to NCDC in February. Barring 17 patients from Wardha, results of all the other samples are awaited. The woman along with her in-laws had attended the ‘haldi’ ceremony of one of her relatives in the city on February 17. Her brother-in-law was the first from the family to test positive on February 22. He died on March 8. She had tested positive in Wardha on February 25 and was admitted to IGGMCH. She was discharged on March 6. The woman also claimed that her repeat test was negative after she was discharged.

Singh was rushed to a private hospital near Patliputra Colony roundabout from the spot, which is hardly 200 metres away, within minutes of the incident. Hospital sources said the bullet had severely damaged his main blood vessel resulting in heavy internal bleeding. “Several units of blood were transfused but he could not survive and died Saturday afternoon,” a hospital source said. Meanwhile, even after more than 24 hours, Patna police could not arrest any of the criminals involved in the Friday crime at around 1.30pm. The cash was looted from an employee of a private firm, which handles heavy cash transactions for banking institutions. The employee had taken out the money from the cash van and entered inside the ATM kiosk to replenish it when criminals looted it. Singh, working as a guard for the firm, was shot at in the back. City SP (central) Vinay Tiwari said raids were going on to nab the criminals. “Till now, it has surfaced that only three criminals were involved in the loot,” he said. The SP said nothing has surfaced to indicate any firm insider’s role in the incident. Sources said all the criminals involved in the loot were locals and earlier involved in petty crimes like snatching. “Identities of all three criminals who committed the loot had been ascertained and they would be nabbed soon,” a source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/atm-guard-succumbs-to-injury-during-treatment/articleshow/81608354.cms||---

Police also seized a truck and a car used by the smugglers. Speaking to reporters at the district police office in Chittoor, SP S Senthil Kumar said they received credible information about red sanders being smuggled to Karnataka. Following the tip-off, Chittoor taluk SI N Vikram along with reserve police inspectors conducted vehicular checks along the Tirupati-Bengaluru highway near Penumuru cross in the early hours of Saturday. Police noticed a car and a truck moving at some speed to avoid police checks, but got both vehicles to stop. Upon inspecting the vehicles, police found the truck carrying 182 red sanders logs, worth Rs 2.5 crore in the international market. According to Chittoor SP, the key accused in the case has been identified as U Sivayya (31), who is an accused in 12 red sanders smuggling cases at various police stations in Kadapa district. Police had also charged him under the Preventive Detention (PD) Act in the past.

Deshmukh refuted all the allegations and has asked CM Uddhav Thackeray to conduct a thorough inquiry into the charges. He said he was filing a defamation case against Singh and would challenge him to prove the allegations. “Why was Parambir Singh sitting quietly for so many days after Sachin Waze was arrested? Why didn’t he open his mouth at that time? And if he is claiming that Sachin Waze gave him all this information in February then why didn’t he speak at that time,” asked Deshmukh. He said that as soon as Singh realised that he will be removed from his post, he engaged in a conversation with ACP Sanjay Patil on March 17. He deliberately asked a few questions to Patil and conveniently got expected answers, Deshmukh alleged. “This was a part of Singh’s larger conspiracy. It seems as if he intended to get ‘specific’ answers from these chats so that he can term them as ‘evidence’ later. The desperation of Singh is clearly evident through these chats as he was leading the conversation to repetitively get particular information from Patil, why was that?” he asked. Deshmukh said after his comments at an event regarding the reason for Singh’s removal, Singh again tried to create some evidence in the form of another series of WhatsApp conversations on March 19. Deshmukh also said everyone in the police department is well aware that Waze and ACP Patil are very close to Singh. It was Singh who reinstated Waze.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-will-file-defamation-case-says-deshmukh/articleshow/81609429.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Patna||Looking back: Teachers feel online classes have limitations||PATNA: It has been almost a year since Covid-19 began battering the nation and disturbing the teaching-learning process, which derailed the entire academic year 2020-21. Even though the secondary and higher secondary schools reopened from January 4, followed by class VI to VIII and class I to V on March 1, students are struggling to make up for the academic losses suffered during the prolonged lockdown. Alan Cowell, a senior teacher at Don Bosco Academy, said 2020 was very difficult for students as well as for teachers. “The online classes were not very successful as all students did not have access to online gadgets. However, we managed and came a long way and learned a lot of things. Schooling is not what we can do online; it is always better to learn at school,” he said. RS Pandey, a physics teacher at St Michael’s High School, said all students have different level of intelligence. “After the classes resumed, we are helping the weaker students by giving more attention to them and taking extra classes to cover the syllabus. Now, things are getting better. The pandemic has also helped teachers understand the new teaching methodology,” he said. Namita, a teacher at Carmel High School, believes that there are several challenges in online classes. “Initially, it was difficult. But gradually, not only teachers but the kids also adapted the new practice. For kindergarten classes, I made a WhatsApp group and sent videos and had regular interaction with kids and parents to ensure that they are learning,” she said. Students and parents also faced hardships, when the schools were suddenly closed. Shashank Kumar, a class VIII student, said he learned a lot but had to spend sleepless nights. “At the beginning, I thought it would be for a short period. But after a month, I became serious as I knew I had to study all alone,” he said. Prerna Gupta, a class V student, also believes that the online classes were not effective as the schoolteachers only shared the study materials. A class IX student, Vinit Singh said, “What I have learned in the last two and a half months, I could not during the online classes from April to December last year.” Parvez Alam of Ashiana Colony, whose daughters study in class IV and XI, said the entire academic year was a waste for kids as no teaching-learning took place. “Especially for primary kids, it was very difficult because they need more guidance compared to senior students. Besides, all the teaching was being done by the parents as school shared the study materials only,” he recalled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/looking-back-teachers-feel-online-classes-have-limitations/articleshow/81608277.cms||Faryal Rumi

Principal secretary of the environment, forest and climate change department, Dipak Kumar Singh, appreciated the efforts of the government for conserving sparrows. Assistant director of Press Information Bureau (Patna), Sanjay Kumar, claimed that even if sparrows were not yet on the verge of extinction, “their declining population is a matter of concern”. He also urged people to place a pot filled with water and grains in their houses to attract sparrows. Meanwhile, the vice-chancellor of Chhapra-based Jai Prakash University, Faruque Ali, pointed out that human negligence had affected the population of sparrows.

The accused alleged that they killed the SI because he used them for unnatural sex with him. The body of SI Rana Ravi Ranjan Pratap Singh (54) was found near Dumari-Juara railway station on Wednesday. SI Singh (54) was posted in Samastipur and had come to his village Naraon under Awatarnagar police station area on Tuesday and went missing. His son Aman Pratap had lodged an FIR regarding his disappearance. Saran SP Santosh Kumar said late Friday evening that besides the two minors, the third arrested accused was identified as Rajan Kumar of Kazipur village under Doriganj police station area. Another person involved in the crime was absconding. The accused told the police that the deceased used to have unnatural sex with them and had also offered them a mobile phone. But they had already planned to kill him the same day. Police claimed the accused had arranged iron rods and other sharp objects and killed the SI when he met them on Tuesday. “A team headed by SDPO M P Singh was constituted to probe the case. Rajan has confessed to his crime, saying the deceased had also promised him a smartphone in lieu of enjoying unnatural sex,” the SP said. “On Tuesday, the deceased called us for indulging in unnatural sex. But we killed him instead as we had been harassed and wanted to get rid of him,” Rajan allegedly told the police. Police sources said the allegations of the arrested persons had been verified by the call detail records and it was found that the SI had communicated to them earlier as well. The police sources further said the accused also have suspicious background.

After the government finalised the tender and cleared the proposal on Saturday, Jayaprakash Power Ventures Limited, a subsidiary of the group, emerged as the successful bidder by quoting the highest price. The tender process and technical biddings were handled by Metal Scrap Trade Corporation Limited (MSTC), a central government undertaking. Jaypee Group will handle sand excavation and supply in the state for the next two years. As per the government’s upgraded sand policy, the successful bidder will excavate sand and open sand stock points close to the sand reaches. Customers can check the quality of the sand and pay for its supply. The government will fix a ceiling on the price and if any violations are reported, action would be taken against the supplier. The government has said there is no need to apply for sand online and people can arrange their own transportation or ask for transport. The government had earned Rs 161.30 crore on sand in 2019-20 and Rs 380 crore during 2020-21 till February. It is expecting to earn a revenue of Rs 765 crore in the next financial year with the new contractor. The government had divided the state into three zones for sand excavation in different reaches and JPVL offered the highest price for each of the three packages. The price of the sand will be uniform at each reach across the state, with an upper ceiling regionally based on distance. “Customers can lodge a complaint with the authorities concerned if higher rates are charged. Strict action will be taken on such complaints,” the government release mentioned. However, the ban on sand excavation in patta (private) lands will continue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/jaypee-group-to-handle-sand-excavation-supply/articleshow/81608601.cms||---

Officers have been instructed to fix the camera to their uniforms during duty hours and switch them on when a suspected vehicle is flagged down, a suspect is interrogated or when a statement is recorded. “We don’t want any controversy. Recording searches and seizures will also ensure that police stick to the rule book. It will also act as evidence for use in court as well as before the Election Commission,” said an officer at Lalbazar. The body camera rule will be in place during both day and night checks. On Friday night, extra vigil was visible across the city, especially in added areas which go to polls early. Officers felt the use of cameras will help record not only the scene of crime, but also capture statements of witnesses and suspects that can help in better analysis and will, ultimately, lead to arrest. “If body cameras are on, senior officers can monitor an operation even if he is not present on the site. Since we employ GPS in all major cases to map the crime scenes, the recordings can be valuable,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-asked-to-keep-body-cameras-on/articleshow/81608806.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Vijayawada||A year into outbreak, hurdles remain for Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams||TIRUPATI: It has been a year since the Lord Venkateswara temple at Tirumala closed for pilgrim worship. On March 20, 2020, the hill temple closed its doors for devotees as a preventive measure to contain the rapid spread of Covid-19, days ahead of the nationwide lockdown. This was the first time in 128 years that pilgrim worship had to be suspended at the temple, which is believed to be nearly 2,000-years-old, records available with the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) show. The last time that the temple was closed down was in 1892, when even rituals were suspended, though the reasons for this are unknown. Though the temple finally reopened for devotees on June 11 after three days of a trial run from June 8, things were not the same for the TTD, which continues to battle challenges posed by the pandemic one year into the outbreak. In the initial days after resuming pilgrim worship, the TTD allowed between 3,000 to 5,000 devotees per day for darshan, with strict adherence to Covid-19 norms. Over time, the temple body graduaylly scaled up the number of devotees in keeping with a series of Unlock guidelines issued by the Union ministry of home affairs. Today, over 50,000 devotees worship at the Tirumala temple every day. At the meeting of the trust board last month, the temple body disclosed its plans of reintroducing arjitha sevas for devotees. But with reports of a second wave of Covid-19 and with nearly 70 persons, including students and faculty members at TTD’s Dharmagiri Veda patasala, recently contracting the virus, the TTD administration is leaving no stone unturned to keep the disease at bay in Tirumala and Tirupati. Meanwhile, the temple recently embarked on a vaccination drive for its employees. So far, abour 1,000 staffers have been inoculated. The temple body also won accolades for its efforts in ensuring not a single devotee has been reported of having contracted the virus after a pilgrimage to the hill town.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/a-year-into-outbreak-hurdles-remain-for-ttd/articleshow/81608576.cms||Sandeep Raghavan
---||Patna||As Covid cases rise again, docs look back at year of horror||PATNA: One year ago on March 22, Bihar reported its first Covid-19 death. The deceased was among the first three positive cases detected in the state. As the pandemic spread its tentacles, the state’s healthcare system was tested to its limits even as the government and the frontline workers, including healthcare professionals and workers, rose to the challenge to tackle the deadliest virus in living memory. The state has so far registered over 2.63 lakh cases and 1,556 deaths. The first death recorded a year ago was that of a 38-year-old Munger resident with travel history from Qatar. He had a kidney ailment and his Covid-19 positive report came after his death. Of the two other positive cases, one was a 45-year-old Digha resident with travel history from Nepal and was admitted at AIIMS-Patna. The third was that of a 25-year-old man from Phulwarishif with travel history from Scotland and he was admitted to NMCH, which was designated as the first dedicated Covid-19 hospital in Bihar. Though the cases were being detected from several pockets across the state of people with travel history, the pace was slow. It was only after the influx of migrant workers from May onwards that Bihar started witnessing a steep increase in the infection rate. This graph kept rising and by July-August it had reached the peak with the state registering nearly 3,000 cases on a daily basis. In August alone, over 50,000 new cases were registered. However, from August end the number of cases started decreasing and on August 31, the state registered just 1,324 new cases in a day, much less than average daily. This reduced to less than a 1,000 cases daily by the end of October. By November end it further decreased with November 30 recording 457 new cases and after a month on December 31, the cases came down to 392. By January end in the New Year, the number of daily cases reduced to around 100. But, with the increase in cases again in other parts of the country, Bihar, too, is witnessing a slow increase in March. Health experts, frontline workers and common people recall the eerie atmosphere which had engulfed them and how even the news of one positive case sent a shiver up their spine. Dr Sanjeev Kumar, who is the nodal in-charge for Covid-19 at AIIMS-Patna said, “Last year was very challenging. We all had to leave behind our specialisations and came forward to extend help. But it was a life time experience for everyone. We all are satisfied with the service we gave.” Dr Sanjeev further said boosting the morale of healthcare workers and junior doctors was also a challenge as they played a great role in fighting the pandemic. IMA state senior vice-president Dr Ajay Kumar said in the course of duty, nearly 750 doctors across the country and 55 in Bihar, lost their lives. “We knew we would die, but we had our social responsibility,” he said, expressing dissatisfaction with the behaviour meted out to the family of the deceased doctors. “But it was a victory of modern medicine over a dogmatic system,” he added. Medha Mishra, a resident of Rajeev Nagar, recalled, “Even the news of one positive case and shortage of ventilator and beds used to create panic. I am thankful to all healthcare workers for their dedication in keeping us safe.” Covid cases show marginal rise with 88 new patients: Bihar reported altogether 88 new Covid-19 cases on Saturday against 55,376 samples tested with Patna alone registering 41 of the new cases. In the same period, 51 people have recovered. There is a marginal increase in the active cases. For instance, there were 435 active cases on Friday and it increased to 471 on Saturday. The state had 332 active cases on March 13, and in one week it has reached 471. Similarly, the recovery rate showed a marginal dip from 99.28% last Saturday to 99.23% this Saturday. Covid-19 cases were reported from 20 districts with Patna registering the highest number of cases, followed by Nawada with seven cases and Rohtas six. As per data shared by the state health society, one death was reported in the state from Patna.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/as-covid-cases-rise-again-docs-look-back-at-year-of-horror/articleshow/81608257.cms||Sheezan Nezami

The bench headed by Justice DVSS Somayajulu heard the petition. VRN Prashanth, counsel for the petitioner, submitted that it is the bounden duty of the Andhra Pradesh State Election Commission (APSEC) to hold elections to MPTCs and ZPTCs. He submitted that the delay in the election process will affect local governance. The state government represented by advocate-general Subramanya Sri Ram argued that APSEC should hold the MPTC and ZPTC polls at the earliest. N Ashwani Kumar, standing counsel for APSEC, argued the SEC being an independent body, shall be given the liberty and freedom to exercise its mind in arriving at a decision to notify the election date for MPTCs and ZPTCs.

---||Ahmedabad||26 cases of UK, South African Covid-19 strains in Gujarat so far||AHMEDABAD/SURAT: A 31-year-old man from Kalol suspected to have the South African strain has tested positive for the foreign strain. With this, senior state health department officials confirmed that Gujarat has recorded a total of 26 cases of foreign Covid-19 strains – UK and South African – in Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara and Kalol. All the patients are discharged, and their contact history is being traced. It was believed that Gujarat had seven-odd foreign strain cases so far but in all 26 patients were detected and have recovered too. “Majority of these patients are identified based on the random testing undertaken by the department where 5% of the confirmed positive samples are sent for genetic profiling randomly. The process is time consuming and results arrive after seven to 10 days of submitting the samples,” said a senior official. The officer added that majority cases had travel history or direct contact with a foreign returned person and cases of local transmission of these strains are few. “We don’t necessarily see the presence of these strains as the reason behind the current surge. It’s more to do with overall change in virus profile and cyclical nature of the pandemic.” Recently the Union government had announced that India had over 400 confirmed cases of foreign strains. As the cases skyrocket in Surat, the city health officials carried out analysis of the patients and found many patients remained asymptomatic for long and triggered more spread. Several patients reported gastrointestinal illness and skin rashes as new symptoms along with coughing, fever and body ache. “The virus is damaging the lungs of the majority of patients without the person even knowing that he/she is infected. These patients are moving around freely and infecting others," Surat municipal commissioner Banchhanidhi Pani told TOI. “Lung involvement is hidden till the patients turn serious. Due to which those being brought to the hospital already have a serious infection in the lungs.” Further, the health authorities are battling asymptomatic cases as well. Among these patients, rapid test results are also proving false. "Couple of my rapid tests turned out negative. But due to a prolonged fever of around six days, I went to the hospital and during a detailed examination, the infection was found in the lungs," said a resident of the City Light area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/26-cases-of-uk-south-african-covid-19-strains-in-guj-so-far/articleshow/81609584.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Patna||Drunk govt doctor held for creating nuisance in Bihar's Lakhisarai village||PATNA: A government doctor was arrested for creating nuisance after consuming alcohol at a village in Lakhisarai around 1pm on Saturday. The doctor identified as Brij Mohan, aged around 40 years, was arrested from Kaindi village under Halsi police station area. He is a native of Panapur at Chhapra in Saran district. Halsi police station SHO Santosh Kumar Sinha said Mohan was recently posted as in-charge of the primary health centre at Halsi. "Police received a complaint from some villagers at Kaindi that a person was creating nuisance on the road in their village. A patrolling team arrested Mohan and brought him to the police station," he said. Sinha said Mohan was asked to undergo a breathalyzer test which he took after much cajoling. "Alcohol content was found to be very high in his blood stream," the SHO said, adding, Mohan’s rented accommodation is hardly half a kilometre from the spot where he was arrested. "He was earlier posted as in-charge of the primary health centre at Ramgarh which is also nearer to the Kaindi village. It is yet unknown with whom and where he had consumed liquor," the SHO said. Sinha said the doctor was hurling abuses even at the police personnel after he was arrested and threatened to take all of them to high court for arresting him. "An FIR was lodged against the doctor by the patrolling team of police officer Triloki Nath Upadhyay in connection with the incident," he said. He said the doctor was produced before a court in Lakhisarai within hours after which he was remanded in judicial custody. The SHO said no liquor bottle or any other prohibited item was recovered from his possession at the time of the arrest. He said that investigation is going on to ascertain who supplied him the liquor. The SHO added the doctor’s accommodation will be searched to check if he had stocked smuggled liquor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/drunk-govt-doc-held-for-creating-nuisance-in-lakhisarai-village/articleshow/81608368.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The cubs were successfully reunited with their mother by Wildlife SOS & the forest department. The Junnar-based NGO Wildlife SOS and the Maharashtra forest department have had quite an action-packed month. It is cub season for leopards and in the latest incident, farmers at Ozar discovered a pair of baby leopards while harvesting sugarcane crops on Thursday. Identified as males, the cubs were estimated to be about 45 days. Wildlife SOS veterinarian Dr Nikhil Bangar conducted a meticulous examination for ticks and injuries and found the cubs to be healthy and fit for release. The team arranged for the young leopards to be returned to the field so that the mother could find her cubs. Two remote-controlled camera traps were installed in the field to document the reunion process, while the team monitored the area from a safe distance. Dr Bangar said, “The mother must have been searching for her cubs, as it only took 20 minutes for her to find them. We can only imagine her relief on finding them safe and sound! Such reunions are of great importance as they curb conflict situations. If female leopards are unable to locate their cubs, it is natural for them to turn defensive or aggressive and they pose an immediate threat to humans in close proximity.” Kartick Satyanarayan, co-founder and CEO of Wildlife SOS, said, “To survive in the wild and learn the skills of survival, it is crucial for leopard cubs to be reared by their mothers for the first two years of their lives. To date, Wildlife SOS has assisted the forest department in successfully reuniting over 80 cubs that were lost, injured, or separated from their mothers.” Forester Manisha Kale said, “Over the years, we’ve noticed a positive change in the mindset of the local community. Awareness programs have played a key role in sensitizing them to issues of human-leopard conflict so instead of taking matters into their own hands, more and more people are reaching out to us for help when they encounter leopards in the area.” Wildlife SOS (WSOS) is a non-profit charity established in 1998 with the primary objective of rescuing and rehabilitating wildlife in distress across India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/its-leopard-cub-season-in-pune-sugarcane-fields/articleshow/81618480.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Nagpur||Nag Vidarbha Chambers of Commerce welcomes ease in curbs, urges traders to follow Covid-19 guidelines||NAGPUR: President of Nag Vidarbha Chambers of Commerce (NVCC) Ashwin Mehadia welcomed district guardian minister Nitin Raut’s decision to extend restrictions till March 31 while offering some relaxations. Hawkers and autorickshaw drivers too have cancelled their plan for an indefinite hunger strike. However, hoteliers expressed disappointment. State home minister Anil Deshmukh has urged the police department to go slow on citizens venturing out during the extended restrictions. “Do not use force like lathi charging the public during enforcement. Ensure that restrictions are being followed as much as possible through other strategies,” he said. City police chief Amitesh Kumar said the first phase of the bandobast would be between 4pm and 11pm and the second phase would be between 11pm and 6am. “Traders and merchants were taken into confidence before announcing the restrictions and relaxations for the coming days. They were very much part of the decision-making process. If they resort to protesting then strict legal action could be taken against them,” he said. While thanking Raut for considering the business community’s concerns, Mehadia said shopkeepers will extend all cooperation to the administration. On the lines of Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray’s slogan ‘My Family, My Responsibility’, Mehadia urged traders to strictly follow the Covid-19 protocol and practice ‘Majhi Dukan, Majhi Jawabdari’ (My Shop, My Responsibility). “Don’t entertain customers without masks,” he said and urged shoppers to skip visiting a mask-less shopkeeper. “If a shopkeeper is not following guidelines then he should keep his establishment closed,” said Mehadia. In a video statement, he urged shopkeepers to strictly follow the 4pm deadline. Earlier in the day, Mehadia had threatened the administration by saying, “If the lockdown is extended, traders will take to the streets to oppose the decision and will keep their shops open from Monday (March 22).” Hawkers and autorickshaw drivers from Hingna too cancelled their plan to resort to an indefinite hunger strike, said Prem Kumar of Autorickshaw Chalak Malak Sangh (Hingna road), who, on Friday, had announced that as many as 300 autorickshaw drivers and a similar number of hawkers would stage an indefinite agitation at Lokmanya Nagar Metro Station, near Hingna T-point if the weeklong restriction got stricter. Meanwhile, Nagpur Residential Hotels’ Association (NRHA) termed the extension of restrictions to hotels and restaurants unacceptable. Restaurants and Banquet Halls have been closed by the administration since the last 15 days in Nagpur and after a lot of follow-up and requests, the latest extension order permits restaurants to remain open only till 7pm. NRHA president Tejinder Singh Renu and secretary Deepak Khurana have condemned the administration for giving ‘step motherly treatment’ to the hospitality sector. “While all shops have been permitted to remain open till 4pm, the administration should have allowed restaurants to operate from 4pm to 11pm. NRHA has always supported action against those who do not follow distancing and other Covid safety protocols. If any restaurant is found not following the requisite SOP, the administration should take action, the duo said via a press release. “All our members are taking precautions. The administration needs to understand that those who are following all the guidelines must not be punished. It would have been better if restaurants were asked to remain shut rather than the 7pm norm. At least we’ll save expenses like salaries, electricity bills, raw materials and other overheads. Online food delivery is permitted till 11pm, same as before when there was total curfew last year,” they said. The hospitality sector devoted a lot of its energy and resources during the first lockdown as some restaurants and hotels offered free meals to the needy. “We are not begging for any favours for our generosity in the past. We are only legitimately demanding our rights,” they added. “Everyone knows that restaurants do business only during dinner time and with 7pm as the closing time, we’ll only increase our losses,” the duo stated. “Western Maharashtra is also witnessing a similar surge in Covid cases, but only Nagpur is being punished with such harsh restrictions. NRHA fails to understand why this step-motherly treatment is being meted out only to Nagpur,” said Renu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nvcc-welcomes-ease-in-curbs-urges-traders-to-follow-covid-19-guidelines/articleshow/81608930.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Patna||25 investors keen to set up ethanol units: Bihar govt||PATNA: Around 25 investors have shown active interest in establishing greenfield ethanol production units in Bihar so far, additional chief secretary of the industries department Brajesh Mehrotra said here on Saturday. This comes a day after the industries minister Shahnawaz Hussain formally unveiled the state’s ethanol promotion policy. “Around 25-30 investors have approached the department saying they have proposals to establish greenfield (or new) ethanol production units in the state,” Mehrotra said, adding, “There are around six other investors who have made inquiries to assess the scope and scenario for making the investment to open ethanol production units.” The state cabinet had given its clearance for the fuel-grade ethanol production promotion policy on Tuesday. The decision to promote standalone fuel-grade ethanol production units was taken by Centre last year in October-November. According to Mehrotra, the money they invest will depend on the fuel-grade ethanol production capacity of the unit they propose to envisage and establish. “The thumb rule is that if the ethanol production capacity of the unit is 100 kilo litres per day, it will require an investment of around Rs 150 crore. The unit proposed by an investor might have the production capacity less than that, and so it will require less investment,” Mehrotra said. “In general terms, around 25 proposals that the investors have discussed are in the range of investments worth Rs 70 crore to Rs 200 crore, and from Rs 300 crore to Rs 400 crore, to establish greenfield\new units,” he added. “As to the 25 proposals that have come, the investors have not yet submitted their proposals in writing. They have shown concrete interest and intention, though. The proposals they have made are not in the nature of expression of interest,” Mehrotra further said. He added, “This, in concrete terms, will amount to nothing unless they formally submit a project proposal, which will have to be backed by the details of the quantum of actual investment that they propose to make, and will also be supported by the detailed project report (DPR). After that, the department will process their proposals without any delay.” Praising the state government for taking the call, Mehrotra said, “Since the state government took the initiative early, and also got into the mode of making the promotion policy framework early, we have started getting positive feedback.” Also, investors might show interest in making investment in the “brown units,” which implies investment meant for expansion, modernization, strengthening\renovation of the already existing units, added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/25-investors-keen-to-set-up-ethanol-units-bihar-govt/articleshow/81608236.cms||Abhay Singh

Railways officials said that health workers have been deployed at adequate numbers at all major stations to ensure strict adherence to Covid protocols during journey. According to Danapur divisional railway manager (DRM) Sunil Kumar, railways has started random scanning of passengers on station premises in cooperation with the state health department. "At least four major stations Patna Junction, Rajendra Nagar Terminal, Patliputra Junction and Danapur falling under Danapur division of ECR have been provided with thermal screening facilities to check passengers either entering station premises or making an exit," he said. The official claimed that railway security staff have been put on alert to check all passengers coming from Mumbai, Amritsar and Karnakata areas from where Covid-19 cases have been reported high these days. "Railways has restarted passenger scanning facility at these four stations from where most special passenger trains are either originating from or passing through the jurisdiction of Danapur division," Sunil said, adding railways is allowing only confirmed ticket holders to enter station premises from the passengers’ safety point of view. According to ECR chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar, railways has taken the recent surge in Covid-19 cases in other states seriously. “As directed by the ministry of railways and health department, railways is committed to follow these directives and ensure adherence to Covid protocols on station premises as well as during journey by trains. Railways has made availability of “use and throw linens at kiosks located at major station premises of ECR to fulfil the needs of passengers during journey,” he said. He added: “Railway security personnel have been asked to ensure social distancing norms among passengers both at the time of making entry into station premises to board trains or making an exit from station areas. Posters, banners and hand bills will be distributed among passengers to create mass awareness about the pandemic.” “The official claimed that railways has also started making announcements on the public address system at each major station cautioning passengers to wear masks as compulsory and avail sanitizer facility available at each platform of major stations,” the CPRO said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/railways-reviews-passenger-safety-measures-amid-rise-in-covid-cases/articleshow/81608395.cms||Kumod Verma

The male lion, Viswas, that attacked Gautam Guchait was fine, but was not released into the open area from its shelter on Saturday. Talking to TOI, zoo director Asish Kumar Samanta said enclosures of lion, white tiger, rhino, elephant, crocodile and bear will get special iron net fencing — almost 8ft high — to thwart any possible intrusion attempt in future. “On Saturday, we started the work with the lion enclosure. That’s why we didn’t bring any of the lions out in the open area. So far, visitors used to get a clear view from the other side of the main iron fencing, but from now on, this will be obstructed. But, we are left with no other choice. We can’t take any chance,” said Samanta. According to him, after the work on the lion enclosure is over, they will start installing the net at the elephant enclosure. “Gradually, we will cover all such open-air enclosures, like that of the white tiger, rhino and bear,” he added. On Friday, the 40-year-old, reportedly mentally unstable, man suffered only minor injuries after climbing the peripheral wall of the lion enclosure and jumping in. Guchait, who reportedly just wanted to “set the big cat free”, had injuries and cuts on his legs when the lion attacked him. However, zoo officials managed to lead the animal away. “The importance of responsible human behaviour with regard to wild animals has just recently been demonstrated in a legal directive condemning the baiting of lions for tourism in Gir National Park of Gujarat. While welcoming this directive as a landmark precedent for responsible tourism practices applicable to wild animals, we also call for stringent security measures to be instituted in all zoos for visitors, combined with heightened conservation education programmes,” said Shubhobroto Ghosh, wildlife projects manager, World Animal Protection in India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/iron-net-at-open-air-enclosures-to-keep-zoo-intruders-at-bay/articleshow/81608788.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Ishrat Jahan case: Gujarat govt denies sanction to prosecute 3 cops||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat government has refused sanction to prosecute three accused police officials including IPS officer G L Singhal, retired DySP Tarun Barot and an assistant sub-inspector, Anaju Chaudhary, in the 2004 Ishrat Jahan fake encounter case, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) told a special court here on Saturday. The refusal has led the three cops to file an application to drop the proceedings against them and discharge them from the case. “The court has fixed March 31 for further proceedings,” said Brijrajsinh Jhala, advocate of IGP Singhal, who is currently posted at Karai Police Academy. These are the last three cops who are facing prosecution for charges of murder, criminal conspiracy, abduction and illegal detention of the 19-year old girl from Mumbra, Ishrat Jahan, and her companions Javed Shaikh alias Pranesh Pillai, Zeeshan Johar and Amjad Ali Rana, who were shot dead on June 15, 2004 on the outskirts of Ahmedabad in a police encounter. The CBI counsel R C Kodekar on Saturday informed special CBI judge V R Raval about the denial of prosecution sanction under Section 197 of the CrPC. He placed a letter sent by the state government to the CBI in a sealed cover. The refusal of permission to prosecute the cop by the government suggests that it believes that the shootout on June 15, 2004 was carried out by the cops in the line of discharge of their duty and hence they are not required to be put on a trial, sources in the know of the development said. On October 23, the court had rejected discharge applications filed by these three accused for want of prosecution sanction under Section 197 of the CrPC. Under this section, sanction is required for prosecuting government servants for anything done in the discharge of official duty. The court had directed the CBI to obtain the sanction from the competent authority, but the state government refused the sanction of which the CBI court was apprised of on Saturday. The Ishrat Jahan encounter case was committed against eight cops in a sessions court. One of the accused cops and the complainant, J G Parmar, died during the pendency of the proceedings. A commando, Mohan Kalasava, had died by the time CBI filed the chargesheet. In 2019, retired DIG D G Vanzara and SP N K Amin were discharged from the case after the state government refused to accord prosecution sanction. Before that, the court had discharged former in-charge DGP P P Pandey in this case. The Centre had refused to grant this permission for prosecution sanction in this case for four Intelligence Bureau officials including former special director, Rajinder Kumar. Following this, the court had refused to accept the supplementary chargesheet filed against them citing absence of the sanction. Revision applications for accepting the chargesheet and committal of a case were also refused. After the shootout on June 15, 2004, the Ahmedabad crime branch declared that Ishrat and three others were Lashkar-e-Taiba operatives who had come to Gujarat to kill then chief minister Narendra Modi in order to avenge the 2002 riots.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ishrat-case-guj-govt-deniessanction-to-prosecute-3-cops/articleshow/81609563.cms||---

From about 15 to 18 cases in the last week, yesterday we had over 40 cases. We have already converted one ward back into a Covid ward. Looking at Mumbai and Bengaluru, and as per the indication of our internal clinical teams, we want to be prepared for a further spike,” said Dr Rahul Medakkar, hospital chief operating officer, Care Hospitals, Banjara Hills. The next few weeks will be crucial in judging whether the increase in cases is going to be continuous or not, said hospital sources. “The increase has been seen largely in the last one week, but its too early to predict anything. Most hospitals will have to increase covid wards if there is a spike. We will be watching the situation for three to four weeks,” said Dr Bhaskar Rao, president, Telangana Super Speciality Hospitals Association. Overall, however, bed availability is still nearly 90% currently. Most cases are of mild to moderate infection, but hospitals are already gearing up for more cases in the coming weeks.

Speaking to the media after attending a meeting convened by guardian minister Nitin Raut to review Covid-19 situation, the MLAs and MLCs have agreed that total lockdown wasn’t a solution, as it adversely affects the common man. Acknowledging the fact that a number of the city’s Covid-19 cases are going northwards, they stressed on taking urgent steps like increasing vaccination along with contact tracing and testing. Even Union minister Nitin Gadkari, Ramtek MP Krupal Tumane and state home minister Anil Deshmukh interacted with Raut and other officers, including divisional commissioner Sanjiv Kumar, collector Ravindra Thakare and NMC commissioner Radhakrishnan B, through video conferencing. Assuring full support in administration’s fight against Covid, Gadkari advised Raut to take help of NGOs and private hospitals. He also suggested taking into consideration poor and needy sections of the society before enforcing any lockdown so that no one should resort to extreme steps like ending their lives due to financial constraints. Asserting that the full lockdown leads to big losses to the economy, leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis said the administration should boost vaccination drives across all wards. “Currently, we’ve 6.87 lakh citizens over 45 and 60 years of age having comorbidities. This amounts to 6.87% of the total population. We need to increase vaccination to 30,000 to 40,000 per day, which currently is 10,000 per day.” Calling on police personnel not to resort to lathi charge or other harsh steps, Deshmukh advised them in the meeting to handle the situation in a gentle manner. “The Zilla Parishad chief executive officers should rope in Patwaris and other officials for creating awareness about the situation and motivate them to take vaccine,” he said. Pointing out that number of Covid-19 beds weren’t increased by the administration even after Nagpur bench of Bombay high court’s directives last year, Fadnavis said he and other public representatives had discussed the need to increase number of beds as well as designated Covid-19 hospitals to cater to increasing number of patients. “The minister responded positively to our suggestions.” Hailing the administration’s decision to impose partial lockdown, MLA VIkas Thakre, who couldn’t attend the meeting, said the administration should take care that common people shouldn’t be harassed. “The NMC’s Nuisance Detection Squad (NDS) are imposing fines on the people who are already in dire straits. The daily wagers like tyre puncture shops owners, labourers, Pan Thela owners, vegetable vendors are suffering due to this lockdown.” Requesting the guardian minister to grant relaxations for the education sector due to examination season, MLC Abhijit Wanjari, who participated in the meeting through video conferencing, said he had suggested for a dialogue with Nagpur University vice chancellor and other education experts for smooth conduction of all papers. “I’ve also told them to use private colleges like ours as vaccination centres so that maximum people should get benefits. The education activities shouldn’t be stopped at this crucial juncture,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/complete-lockdown-not-a-solution-strict-restrictions-needed-oppn-ruling-members/articleshow/81608943.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Mumbai||Govt official who got transfer via ‘political route’ gets no HC relief||MUMBAI: Bombay high court refused relief to a government official who took the “political route” to get himself transferred in place of another officer who was sought to be transferred mid-term. A bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni dismissed a petition by Anil Parkhe against Maharashtra Administrative Tribunal’s November 28, 2020 order that set aside the transfer of Gopinath Kolekar and directed him to be reposted. “The petitioner (Parkhe) also resorted to a novel method of approaching the Maharashtra State (Pradesh) Congress Committee”, and through such political influence and interference appealed to the Hon’ble Revenue Minister and the Hon’ble Chief Minister, to take a decision to transfer him from Nashik to Pune, on the post held by respondent (Kolekar),” said the verdict on March 16. Kolekar had joined as joint district registrar, class I, in Pune on May 21,2018 for a three-year term. The Civil Services Board on September 30, 2020 transferred him as inspector-general, Registration and Stamps, Pune, due to complaints. It recommended his replacement by an officer from Nandurbar. The judges said what transpired when CSB’s decision was sent for approval to revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat and CM Uddhav Thackeray is “quite significant”. “The Hon’ble ministers approved a proposal to the effect that on the vacancy which would be created on the transfer of Kolekar, the petitioner [Parkhe] who was working as assistant district registrar, class I, at Nashik be accommodated on Kolekar’s post at Pune,’’ wrote Justice Kulkarni for the bench. Kolekar’s advocate Sujeet Joshi said his transfer was done only to accommodate Parkhe. The judges said minutes of CSB meeting show it did not consider the purported complaints – two anonymous and a third of a bogus document registered before Kolekar took charge. They noted that Parkhe’s transfer was not before CSB to decide. He wrote to the desk officer, Mantralaya, to transfer him to Pune for personal reasons. “He also decided to take the political route” and approached MPCC secretary Rajaram Deshmukh who wrote to Thorat on August 7, 2020. Thorat and later the CM on August 13 approved Parkhe’s transfer and “substituted” him in place of the officer from Nandurbar. The judges said there was no ground to transfer Kolekar mid-term as the complaints were wholly bogus. Rejecting Parkhe’s case “in its entirety,” they concluded that MAT rightly held Kolekar’s transfer “wholly illegal”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaiofficial-who-got-transfer-via-political-route-denied-relief/articleshow/81610016.cms||Rosy Sequeira

---||Allahabad||HC reserves verdict on plea in KVT-Gyanvapi land dispute case||Prayagraj: The Allahabad high court has reserved its judgment on a petition challenging maintainability of a civil suit pending before the Varanasi district court with respect to land title dispute in the Kashi Vishwanath-Gyanvapi Masjid case. Justice Prakash Padia reserved judgment after hearing the petitioner, Anjuman Intazamia Masazid (mosque committee), Varanasi, and other respondents. The land title dispute relates to the Gyanvapi mosque, which was allegedly built on the ruins of Kashi Vishwanath Temple. According to the suit filed by the temple’s trust in 1991 in Varanasi district court, the temple was destroyed by Mughal emperor Aurangzeb in 1664 and the mosque was built using the remains of the temple. In the instant petition, Anjuman Intazamia Masazid, Varanasi has challenged the maintainability of the said suit taking the plea that Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991, bars filing of suit or any other legal proceedings with respect to conversion of religious character of any place of worship, existing on August 15, 1947. Hence, in this backdrop of the situation, it was argued on behalf of the petitioner that the impugned (under challenge) suit has been filed in contravention of the above provision and proceedings, therefore, it should be quashed on this ground alone. The petitioner has made reference to the Ayodhya-Babri Masjid case, where the apex court has observed, “Historical wrongs cannot be remedied by the people taking law in their own hands. In preserving the character of places of public worship, Parliament has mandated in no uncertain terms that history and its wrongs shall not be used as instruments to oppress the present and the future.” Earlier last year, the high court had stayed the decision of the Varanasi district court to proceed with the hearing of the Kashi Vishwanath Temple-Gyanvapi Mosque land title dispute. It is relevant to mention that after the said suit was filed in 1991, the Allahabad high court had imposed an interim order staying the hearing of the dispute in question. However, in February 2020, the district court held that the stay order stood vacated in the light of a Supreme Court verdict, which provided that all stay orders will come to an end after the expiry of six months unless in an exceptional case by the speaking order such stay is extended. The district court observed that since the stay order passed by the Allahabad high court in 1998 had not been extended by a separate order within six months, the stay was deemed to be vacated and it could resume hearing of the case. The court passed this order on March 15.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/hc-reserves-verdict-on-plea-in-kvt-gyanvapi-land-dispute-case/articleshow/81608867.cms||---

Motor Accident Claims Tribunal held the deceased accountable for 50% contributory negligence towards the accident as he alighted from the moving vehicle. The family of Vinod Chavan — his wife and two kids — had sought Rs 50 lakh compensation from BEST in 2015. Considering his salary and loss of future earning prospects, the tribunal calculated the compensation to be Rs 44 lakh (with interest). However, finding that Vinod’s action had contributed to the accident, it docked 50% from this amount. The victim’s wife and the bus driver gave contradictory versions of events that unfolded on August 5, 2013 at 9 am at Fort. The wife alleged that the bus was being driven at high speed and against traffic rules. She said that while her husband was standing with proper care, when the bus reached near the high court, the driver suddenly applied brakes. The woman claimed that her husband fell down and sustained serious head injuries. She said he was in a coma and in and out of hospital over the next few months. He died at home in January 2014. The driver, however, submitted that he was driving cautiously. He claimed that as he was driving towards Churchgate, he heard passengers shouting that the man, in the process of alighting from the bus, had jumped off from the rear exit and fell. The driver said that he rushed the victim to JJ Hospital. No independent witnesses deposed for either the BEST or the victim’s family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/only-50-relief-for-kin-of-peon-who-jumped-off-best-bus-died-in-mumbai/articleshow/81610033.cms||Rebecca Samervel

The CP himself is monitoring the health of Covid affected senior officers. A two-tier system has been created at the zonal level under supervision of DCPs as the number of positive personnel has reached 255 as on Saturday, including 22 admitted at different hospitals. The police hospital staffers and welfare departments too have been pressed into action.

---||Varanasi||Court to hear KVT-Gyanvapi Mosque case on March 22||Varanasi: The Kashi Vishwanath Temple-Gyanvapi mosque dispute case came up for hearing on Saturday in the district court, which fixed March 22 as the next date for hearing. In December 2019, advocate Vijay Shankar Rastogi had filed an application on behalf of Swayambhu Jyotirlinga Bhagwan Vishweshwar in the court of civil judge requesting survey of the entire Gyanvapi compound by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). He had filed the petition as the ‘next friend’ of Swayambhu Jyotirlinga Bhagwan Vishweshwar. Later, in January 2020, Anjuman Intezamia Masjid Committee had filed an objection against the petition seeking survey of the entire Gyanvapi compound by ASI. The first petition was filed in Varanasi civil court in 1991 on behalf of Swayambhu Jyotirlinga Bhagwan Vishweshwar seeking permission for worship in Gyanvapi. The petitioner had contended that the Kashi Vishwanath Temple was built by Maharaja Vikramaditya about 2,050 years ago, but Mughal emperor Aurangzeb destroyed the temple in 1664 and used its remains to construct a mosque, which is known as Gyanvapi masjid, on a portion of the temple land. The petitioner had requested the court to issue directions for removal of the mosque from temple land and give back its possession to the temple trust. The petition contended that the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act was not applicable on the suit as the mosque was constructed over a partly demolished temple and many parts of the temple exist even today. In 1998, Anjuman Intezamia Masjid Committee moved the high court contending that the mandir-masjid dispute could not be adjudicated by a civil court as it was barred by the law. The high court stayed the proceedings in lower court which continued for the past 22 years. In February 2020, the petitioners approached the lower court again with a plea to resume the hearing as the HC had not extended the stay in past six months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/court-to-hear-kvt-gyanvapi-mosque-case-on-march-22/articleshow/81608818.cms||Binay Singh

---||Jaipur||Exports from Raj beat Covid blues, post higher growth||Jaipur: After the lockdown in April and May, exports from Rajasthan continued to register robust month-on-month growth resulting in a growth of 5% during April-January this fiscal, compared to the same period last fiscal year even as shipments from the country declined by 13.58% during the 10 months.Senior officials in the industries department said that the growth has been led by exports of engineering goods, handicrafts, textiles, metals, chemicals and dimensional stones.The acceleration in economic revival in the state is also reflected in the rise in power demand which has increased by over 11% in December, compared to the same period last year. Meanwhile, investors’ appetite in Rajasthan has improved sharply with RIICO selling record number of industrial plots in the current financial year. “We have sold more than 2500 plots to investors so far in the current financial year, compared to 1,212 in 2019-20, which is also a record. It’s a far cry if you compare with the number of plots RIICO sold in 2018-19 which was around 285,” said Prasadilal Meena, state industries minister.Meena said that we expect to sell about 2,800 plots by the end of the current financial year. “This is a sure sign of rapid revival in the state’s economy. Our e-auction policy has been well received by the investors as it not only increases transparency but also make it hassle-free as anybody from any corner of the world can buy land and set up units,” added Meena.Offering insights into the export data, entrepreneurs in various sectors said the recovery has been fast-paced despite challenges of the pandemic that continues to rage in the key export markets. Dileep Baid, former president of Federation of Rajasthan Handicrafts Exporters (FORHEX), said, “The growth in exports has been broad-based. Most of our markets are doing well across all product segments. We would have done much better had the issue of containers unavailability not been there.”Baid said that workforce strength has almost reached the pre-Covid levels in the handicrafts sector and if there is no second wave, the industry may need more skilled people for the next year as the outlook looks benign.Sectors like engineering goods, industrial chemical, plastic metals have regained lost ground as some overseas buyers preferred India over China.Anil Saboo, president of Indian Electrical and Electronics Manufacturers Association, said, “More and more overseas buyers are scouring Indian markets now days for sourcing. Bearings, auto components and other electrical items where Rajasthan has a production edge are benefitting from the loyalty shift.”The same story of aversion to Chinese products have also played out in the dimensional stone sector with the export of granite growing 1.15% in the said 10 months. Ashok Dhoot, vice-chairman of Centre for Dimensional Stone (CDOS), said,” Though South India is a big rival in the granite sector, Rajasthan enjoys an edge in price competitiveness. In south, the rate is Rs 150 per sq ft, while it is much cheaper in Rajasthan with prices starting from Rs 65. The lower cost is on account of the mining processes and logistics.”GFX MatterPrasadilal Meena, industries ministerWe have sold more than 2,500 plots to investors so far in the current financial year, compared to 1,212 in 2019-20, which is also a record.

---||India||Rs 2k for Assam housewives, Rs 6k min income support in Kerala: Congress||Congress, which released its manifestoes for Assam and Kerala on Saturday, played strong local cards — promising to thwart CAA implementation and safeguard indigenous identity of people in Assam while committing to protect traditions of Sabarimala devotees in Kerala and bringing an end to political violence in the state by assuring a department for peace and harmony. In Assam, Congress general secretary Rahul Gandhi, however, took a leaf out of the ruling BJP’s stand on issues like sheltering cattle and giving ‘land pattas’ to the landless. He said safeguarding the indigenous identity and culture is the party’s principle resolve. “This manifesto is actually a people’s manifesto. It highlights the aspirations of the people of Assam. The manifesto provides five guarantees, but it also provides a guarantee that we will defend the idea of Assam comprising harmony, tradition, language and history,” said Rahul. The manifesto read that CAA, which the party said has endangered the language, culture and history of Assam, will not be implemented and rigorous attempts will be made by Congress to repeal this law that “threatens to divide people”. It also promised pension for families of those killed during the anti-CAA movement, along with extending it for kin of martyrs of the Assam agitation. In Kerala, the Congress-led UDF manifesto went a step ahead of its rival LDF in terms of sops and welfare measures for the poor and marginalised, including promise of Rs 2,000 a month for unemployed home-makers in the 40-60 age group. It also announced schemes like the Nyuntam Aay Yojana (Nyay) assuring a minimum income of Rs 6,000 per month for economically backward families and 5kg rice for all white ration cardholders. The manifesto, which political observers said has a ‘Shashi Tharoor touch’, promises to make Kerala a knowledge hub, proposing a time-bound review of higher education in the state. Both the manifestoes promised succour to Covid-hit people, with UDF promising “no bill hospitals” in Kerala ensuring free treatment for people and a Covid disaster relief commission to look into families, industry and labourers affected by the pandemic. A Covid stimulus package to rejuvenate the state is also mentioned. The manifesto promises to address the issue of digital divide among students that came to the fore in Kerala during the pandemic. In Assam, the Congress promises a Covid-19 financial relief package and another corpus fund to address the loss that people from various sections faced. An interesting feature of the Kerala manifesto is the assurance that a “peace and harmony department” will be set up. According to MP Benny Behanan, chairman of the manifesto committee, this department will put an end to political clashes and murders which are on a rise in the state. Following Rahul Gandhi’s assurance after his deep-sea fishing experience in Kollam, subsidies have been promised for diesel, petrol and kerosene for Kerala’s fisherfolk. The coastal belt finds a special mention in it after the LDF government had come under fire for the controversy over the deep-sea fishing contracts with a US firm. The manifesto says that the UDF government will ensure that the rights of coastal people are protected. The party manifesto in Assam promises gaushalas in every district, but the chairman of the manifesto committee and MP, Gaurav Gogoi, clarified that it is a plea of dairy farmers unlike BJP’s move to protect the ‘holy cow’. Among a flurry of other promises, Congress has assured that holy places, namghars, mandirs, mosques and churches, that have attained an age of 50 years, will be provided financial assistance. This reduced the gap by half-a-century, as the BJP-led state government offered financial assistance to religious institutions, including many temples, mosques and mazar and churches which are mostly over 100 years old. The manifesto promised to waive off debt for women who have taken loans from microfinance banks and stated that there will be free-of-cost state transport for all women. “The longstanding demand for Scheduled Tribe Status of Tai Ahom, Moran, Motok, Chutia, Tea Tribes and Koch-Rajbangshi will be given importance and special attention will be given to ensuring that no enlisted scheduled tribes/castes is affected and for that a solution will be devised ,” the manifesto said. On the perennial flood and erosion issue, the Congress said it will start a database on the number of flood-affected people, details of land eroded along with names of displaced persons. Congress is giving ‘five guarantees’ to Assam voters — no CAA, 200 units of free electricity, Rs 2,000 monthly income guarantee to housewives, Rs 365 as daily wage to tea garden workers, and five lakh jobs.

---||Chandigarh||At home, Ranjit Singh gets hero’s welcome||NAWANSHAHR: Ranjit Singh (22), jailed farm activist who was arrested on January 29 and released on March 17, returned to a hero’s welcome to his native village, Kajampur, on Saturday. He was not just felicitated in his village, where hundreds had gathered from surrounding villages, but also on the way from Balachaur to Kazampur as people lined up to greet and honour him. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, UK MP Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi, Canadian MP Jasraj Singh Hallan and British professional boxer Kell Brook, along with scores of several other prominent social media influencers, also tweeted his pictures. Gandhi, while tweeting Ranjit’s picture of police dragging him from his hair apart from the one with a policeman’s boot pressed against his face, wrote: “Modi government’s trademark – inhuman atrocities.” Ranjit was granted bail by a Delhi court on March 16 and was released on March 17, after which he was flown to Amritsar for paying obeisance at Darbar Sahib. Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee president Manjinder Singh Sirsa drove him from Delhi to Chandigarh on Saturday. For further journey, Ranjit was driven to his village from Chandigarh by former minster and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader Bikram Singh Majithia in his vehicle with Sirsa, Ranjit’s uncle and brother. Scores of motorcycles and cars were part of the cavalcade which was stopped at quite a few places. Youth from surrounding villages waited for a few hours on the way. People showered flower petals on him. In Kazampur, he first went to the village gurdwara and then a function was held in the village to welcome him. Majithia and Sirsa also addressed the function and praised his courage and tenacity. They said Bathinda MP Harmirat Kaur Badal had shown his picture with a cop’s shoe on his face even in Parliament. Ranjit, in his brief address, thanked all and said he had no words to thank the people who supported him. Ranjit’s mother Sarabjit Kaur thanked DSGMC and Sirsa for their efforts to get him released and for continuously remaining in touch with the family and supporting them. Netizens question Yadav’s ‘apology’Till now, DSGMC has been in the spotlight for acquiring bail for farmers arrested on or after January 26, but now SAD has entered the equation with party MLA Bikram Singh Majithia joining Ranjit’s journey back home. Apart from hundreds of people from Ranjit’s village and surrounding villages, SAD leaders and workers participated in his welcome on Saturday. It seems that Sanyukta Kisan Morcha’s (SKM) initial criticism of Ranjit provided the space to DSGMC to champion his cause. In the last couple of days, scores of Punjabi netizens, including those who are critical of SAD, drew a contrast between the role DSGMC played in getting him released and the comments made by SKM leader Yogendra Yadav, in a video interview about him after the January 29 incident. Yadav, in the video, said he had apologised to the SHO who was injured on his arm and the “attack” on police was “very shameful”. The video has been shared widely and SKM leaders criticised by Punjabi netizens for “disowning” Ranjit. DSGMC president Manjider Singh Sirsa said police personnel who thrashed and tortured Ranjit at police station would also be taken to court. His viral photo: Boot to the faceA picture of Ranjit, taken before his arrest and which had gone viral, had a striking similarity to deceased US man Geroge Floyd’s picture which had sparked Black Lives Matter protests in the US. Both photos had a a cop’s boot to the face of the detainee. While Floyd had died, Ranjit, accused of attacking cops at the Kundli-Singhu border after a mob had started pelting stones at the farm protesters, was taken into custody and booked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/at-home-ranjit-gets-heros-welcome/articleshow/81609462.cms||IP Singh
---||Chandigarh||‘Control excessive use of chemical fertilisers’||CHANDIGARH: The Centre has expressed displeasure over unbalanced and indiscriminate use of chemical/s fertilisers in Punjab and Haryana, resulting in depletion of soil fertility and multi-nutrient deficiency. Over the years, Punjab and Haryana, both agrarian states, have recorded usage of chemical fertiliser manifold higher than the national average. In a report tabled both in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, the standing committee on agriculture of department of agricultural research and education under the Union ministry of agriculture and farmers welfare observed that extensive usage of chemical fertilisers over the years has taken a heavy toll on soil, especially the soil under intensive cropping. The excessive use has exposed humans and animals to harmful chemicals, thus affecting their health. The committee felt that this was largely due to the “ignorance” on the part of the farmers about the quality of the soil. To address the problem, stress has been laid on facilitating soil testing at the village level, and the department of agricultural research and education has been asked to coordinate with the department of agriculture cooperation and farmers welfare (DAC&FW) for the same. The department of agricultural research and education has been asked to launch aggressive campaigns to create awareness among farmers about the benefits of soil testing and also about the improvement of soil health. To facilitate the farmers, it has also been recommended to explore the possibility of providing mobile soil testing vehicle at village-level as it would provide results of the soil testing to farmers promptly. The main objective of soil testing is to provide test-based fertiliser recommendation to farmers for balanced fertilisation. This also helps in preparing maps at the district and block levels for monitoring soil health and fertility. For addressing issues related to soil fertility and promoting a balanced use of 55 fertilisers, the department is implementing the programme on soil test crop response (STCR), micro and secondary nutrients and pollutant elements (MSNP) in soils and plants, long term fertiliser experiments (LTFE) and network project on soil biodiversity. The committee also laid stress on the diversification of crops for mitigating the problem of shortage of water and deteriorating soil texture in Punjab and Haryana due to intensive agriculture.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/control-excessive-use-of-chemical-fertilisers/articleshow/81609455.cms||Vinod Kumar

The morcha stated that during 11 rounds of talks with central government ministers, it was repeatedly explained that the three laws were against farmers and citizens in general. Morcha leaders said, “The ECA makes a wholly anti-poor recommendation that food, which is the most essential item for the survival of human beings, should be removed from the list of essential commodities. It allows unlimited private hoarding, which will lead to winding up of PDS facilities. It will render government procurement of foodgrain superfluous and will expose 75 crore beneficiaries to open market purchase of food requirements, promoting corporates and MNCs in food markets.” The morcha also stated that it was “disgraceful” that many parties claiming to support the farmers’ agitation for repeal of the three farm laws, voted for the implementation of ECA. “This exposes a wider consensus amongst these parties on these laws,” the morcha claimed on Saturday evening. Morcha leaders also condemned the statement of RSS in its annual report, saying that anti-national and anti-social forces have created a deadlock between the Modi government and farmers in the agitation related to agricultural laws. “Such thinking towards farmers is an insult to them. The government should immediately repeal all the three agricultural laws and enact the law on MSP,” stated the morcha. Farmers also claimed that the government, in the wake of tough opposition, withdrew the new rules related to wheat procurement. Now, the same system (which was followed in 2020-21) will be followed for wheat procurement. SKM also stated that a Kisan Mazdoor Mahapanchayat was organised in Patna, where thousands of farmer-labourers participated under the banner of All India Kisan Mahasabha and Khegramas. A Kisan Mahapanchayat was organised at Rae Bareli while a Kisan Mazdoor mahapanchayat will be organised in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh on March 22. Mitti Satyagraha Yatra is being organised from March 12 to March 28 in several states. It will start from Dandi on March 30, reach Shahjahanpur on April 5 and Singhu the next day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/farm-front-hits-out-at-parliamentary-panels-reoprt-on-commodities-law/articleshow/81609463.cms||---

The earlier highest one-day tally for the city was 354 on November 21, during the post-Diwali surge. The district also reported five new cases. Surat city with 381 and Vadodara with 132 recorded the second and third highest number of new cases. In all, the four major cities accounted for two-thirds of the new cases in the past 24 hours. For the city, the number of daily cases doubled in just five days – from 205 on March 15 to 401 on March 20. Experts say the majority of cases are recorded in the western city parts. Ahmedabad Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (AHNA) officials on Saturday morning said that occupancy at private hospitals was 683 or 30% of the 2,284 beds available. Of the beds occupied, 21% needed either ICU or ventilatory care, they added. “This is the biggest surge in 2021, as cases had started falling in mid-December. Patients of almost all ages are now coming to the medical setting. One must get him/herself tested if any symptoms associated with Covid-19 are experienced and if a fever doesn’t subside in 24 hours,” said a senior physician. In the past 10 days, the city also recorded the deaths of 11 Covid patients, the highest in the state with a 44% share of the daily toll. With the figures for Saturday, active cases in the city have increased to 1,200. Ahmedabad district had a test positivity rate (TPR) of 3.7% — one of the highest in the state — against the state average of 2.2%. The TPR of the state also recorded a 100% jump in 17 days, from 1.1% to 2.2%. “In the same period, daily tests have increased from 40,000 to 63,000. Thus, the data should be interpreted as the same number of tests finding more cases. Thus, the focus must be on finding patients quickly and isolating them to break the infection chain,” said a city-based pathologist. The surge has prompted the state government to increase inoculation efforts. On Saturday evening, CDHOs were instructed to keep the vaccination programme open from 9am to 8pm to boost the numbers. On Saturday, 14,078 persons got vaccinated in Ahmedabad district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/covid-19-city-records-its-highest-one-day-tally-at-401/articleshow/81610047.cms||---

---||Bhopal||We kept democracy alive, followed the Constitution: Nath||Bhopal: A year after the Kamal Nath government was toppled in Madhya Pradesh, state Congress on Saturday observed ‘Respect for Democracy’ day. PCC chief Kamal Nath’s video message was sent to all district and block party offices across the state. Congress workers also took out marches with the Tricolour and offered floral tributes to the statues of Mahatma Gandhi and B R Ambedkar. In his video speech, Nath said that people voted for a Congress government in 2018. While voting for Congress, people were expecting change and a new dawn. “We worked to fulfil your expectations and our promises,” he said. “We got only 15 months to work. Our government’s work and welfare schemes exposed BJP’s 15 years of false promises and attention-diversion politics. Seeing the rapid development in the state, BJP rejected the people’s mandate and formed a government through deals,” the former chief minister said. Nath claimed that he was aware of the dealings undertaken by BJP. “I had two options. Either I could have indulged in dealings and kept the government or respected democracy and the provisions of the Constitution. I chose to go with the latter and on March 20, 2020, resigned from the post of chief minister. I am proud that we followed the Constitution and kept the democracy alive,” he said. “Today is the day of respect for the democracy. India’s freedom movement was led by Mahatma Gandhi, B R Ambedkar and many such tall leaders who wanted the country to be free. Congress is the only party that knows the true meaning of free India because it fought for Independence,” Nath said. “Democracy will live so long as people choose their governments,” he added. While Nath was away in Delhi, the event in Bhopal was led by former chief minister Digvijaya Singh. Former Union minister Suresh Pachauri also joined the programme at the state Congress headquarters. Addressing the party workers, Digvijaya said that BJP-RSS combine never had faith in the Constitution. “Jan Sangh was the only organisation in the country that had burnt the Constitution when it came into force,” he said. “It is unfortunate that those who assassinated Mahatma Gandhi are ruling the country today. You can see that even people’s right to vote is being purchased with money. If this continues, a common man cannot contest elections any longer. Ruling BJP has secured thousands of crores of rupees by making policies that benefit big industrialists,” Digvijaya added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/we-kept-democracy-alive-followed-the-constitution-nath/articleshow/81608968.cms||---

The availability of the vaccine was also a confidence booster. Experts say that this complacence could mean paying a higher price later on. “The issue is that people have stopped taking Covid precautions. If you see in Hyderabad, the situation is similar to pre-Covid days, parties, functions and eating out everything is happening without any social distancing. With this kind of irresponsible behaviour, numbers might increase further,” said an official from the state health department. Speaking about the Covid positive patients, Dr Ehsan Ahmed Khan, in-charge, director Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences (TIMS) said, “They are thinking that the vaccine availability will protect them. Most of the patients said that the vaccine is there and hence they will not be affected so bad. However, these patients had not taken the vaccine and many do not even fall in the age group which is allowed to get the vaccine.” Along with increase in cases, the issue of cost has returned. “We are seeing an upswing in patients coming to us from private hospitals. They are coming after exhausting their finances. Also people who do not have the facility to stay at home, as they live in a two to three BHKs, are coming to us,” said Khan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/peoples-complacence-cause-for-spike-health-experts/articleshow/81609481.cms||---

Digvijaya said that along with PCC chief Kamal Nath, he tried to reach out to Chouhan after the alleged murder of a block Congress president in Chhatarpur district. “From March 18, our calls were not returned. We were told that the chief minister will speak to us later since he is very busy at present. Maybe he is busy, but is he so busy that he has no time to speak to former chief ministers over the phone?” he asked. “I want to remind Chouhan that during my tenure of ten years, not just former BJP chief ministers, I even spoke to their workers. I utterly condemn such behaviour coming from him,” Digvijaya said. Nath and Digvijaya wanted to speak to Chouhan about the alleged murder of the block Congress president from Chhatarpur district, Inder Singh Parmar. “Five years ago, Parmar’s brother Bhagwat Singh was also murdered and those arrested for the heinous crime were released on bail and even today under political protection, they are engaging in terror in Chhatarpur,” Digvijaya alleged. He said that BJP should not think that Congress is weak. “We will not repose till stringent action is taken against the culprits,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/shivraj-has-no-time-to-listen-to-former-cms-says-diggy/articleshow/81608978.cms||Suchandana Gupta

The family members included children as young as one and a half years of age, women, men and elderly aged up to 80. “I had served in the Army for years to save the nation and now am serving farmers to save the land and future of our children,” Pahalwan said. The khap is prominent in the Bangar belt of Haryana. “I sat on hunger strike along with four generations of my family to show solidarity with farmers. Our children, who saw all this today, will recall when they get holder that their grandfather was ready to sacrifice the lives of his family too to save future generations and lands. Soon, I will go on an indefinite hunger strike if the three laws are not repealed. We have no way left; therefore, we have been forced to initiate stern steps. We will not step down. Today, I donated 20 water pitchers and as many ceiling fans to protesters at Khatkar toll plaza,” Pahalwan said. Ful report on www.toi.in Aryan, grandson of Pahalwan, said it was disheartening to see PM Narendra Modi not show any empathy for farmers who had been protesting for four months. “But children, youth and elderly are at one platform to fight against anti-farmer laws,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/khap-chief-40-of-clan-at-stir-together/articleshow/81609483.cms||---

Students can claim seats through the department's online portal on a first-come-first-served basis until March 26. Over 2.2 lakh students confirmed their place across Mumbai Metropolitan Region, while almost 1 lakh seats remain vacant after the process ended on February 16. The education department declared five merit lists and conducted two rounds of FCFS admissions. However, over the past few weeks, parents and students continued to trickle in at the education department's office demanding that they be given another chance. “A lot of students waited for a college of their choice but eventually didn't confirm a seat anywhere. These students will risk losing a year. Since there are vacancies, we can allow them to claim seats,” said an official. Students who have still not claimed a seat, want to cancel their admission in existing college and claim a seat in another college and fresh applicants will be allowed to participate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/education-department-reopens-fyjc-admissions-in-mumbai/articleshow/81610050.cms||Vinamrata Borwankar
---||Ahmedabad||Hearing on discharge pleas on March 31||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat government has refused sanction to prosecute three accused police officials — IPS officer G L Singhal, retired DySP Tarun Barot and an assistant sub-inspector Anaju Chaudhary — in the 2004 Ishrat Jahan encounter case, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) told a special court here on Saturday. The refusal led the three cops to file an application to drop the proceedings against them and discharge them from the case. “The court has fixed March 31 for further proceedings,” said Brijrajsinh Jhala, advocate of IGP Singhal who is currently posted at Karai Police Academy. These are the last three cops who are facing prosecution for charges of murder, criminal conspiracy, abduction and illegal detention of the 19-year-old girl from Mumbra, Ishrat Jahan and her companions Javed Shaikh alias Pranesh Pillai, Zeeshan Johar and Amjad Ali Rana, who were shot dead on June 15, 2004 on the outskirts of Ahmedabad in a police encounter. CBI counsel R C Kodekar on Saturday informed special CBI judge V R Raval about the denial of prosecution sanction under Section 197 of the CrPC. He placed a letter sent by the state government to the CBI in a sealed cover. The refusal of permission to prosecute the cops by the government suggests that it believes that the shootout was carried out by the cops in the line of discharge of their duty and hence they are not required to be put on a trial, sources in the know of the development said. On October 23, the court had rejected discharge applications filed by these three accused for want of prosecution sanction under Section 197 of the CrPC. Under this section, sanction is required for prosecuting government servants for anything done in the discharge of official duty. The court had directed the CBI to obtain the sanction from the competent authority, but the state government refused the sanction of which the CBI court was apprised of on Saturday. The Ishrat Jahan encounter case was committed against eight cops in a sessions court. One of the accused cops and the complainant, J G Parmar, died during the pendency of the proceedings. A commando, Mohan Kalasava, had died by the time CBI filed the chargesheet. In 2019, retired DIG D G Vanzara and SP N K Amin were discharged from the case after the state government refused to accord prosecution sanction. Before that, the court had discharged former in-charge DGP P P Pandey in this case. The Centre had refused to grant the permission for prosecution sanction in this case for four Intelligence Bureau officials including former special director, Rajinder Kumar. Following this, the court had refused to accept the supplementary chargesheet filed against them citing absence of the sanction. Revision applications for accepting the chargesheet and committal of a case were also refused. After the shootout, the Ahmedabad crime branch declared that Ishrat and three others were Lashkar-e-Taiba operatives who had come to Gujarat to kill then chief minister Narendra Modi in order to avenge the 2002 riots.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hearing-on-discharge-pleas-on-march-31/articleshow/81608987.cms||---

According to police, the woman had visited the garment shop owned by the businessman at Tara Nagar town. “After she lodged the case, we spoke to the other employees of the shop and people in the nearby shops and have not yet found anything which could corroborate rape,” said an investigating officer of the case on Saturday. Police said the woman, after filing the FIR, is yet to turn up for her 164 CrPC statement and her medical examination. “Prima facie, it appears to be a dicey case, but still, we have registered the case and initiated investigation. The accused has turned up for interrogation and promised cooperation,” the officer added. Meanwhile, on Saturday, a group of traders at Tara Nagar town met the senior police officials, saying that they will protest against the ‘fake case of rape’. “We have assured them that an FIR has been lodged and a fair investigation into the matter would be done,” the officer added.

To put the development in perspective, an MoU was signed between government of Gujarat and the Union government in July 2018 to set up state an NCDC branch at the Indian Institute of Public Health, Gandhinagar (IIPH-G). Jayanti Ravi, principal secretary (health and family welfare), said the project is on the track. “We are hopeful about developments in the matter soon,” she said. ‘The state government has been repeatedly requested for transfer of land/signing of a lease deed between the Union government and the state government of Gujarat. Despite various communications since 2018, the state government has not taken any action related to land transfer/signing of lease deed so far,’ reads the letter. Dr Singh in his letter also asked the state government to take the matter on priority ‘in view of the rise in number of outbreaks or pandemic-like situation (Covid-19).’ Experts said that such a centre can boost the understanding of infectious diseases and the genetic make-up of viruses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ncdc-branch-in-gujarat-soon/articleshow/81610044.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Bareilly||World Sparrow Day: Scientific study on sharp decline in sparrow population urgently needed in India, says BNHS expert||PILIBHIT: The common house sparrow, once an integral part of a household, is gradually edging towards extinction and is listed in the Red list of the endangered species of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Expressing concern, deputy director of Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS), Vibhu Prakash, said over the past three decades, there has been an 80% decline in sparrow population in the country as per some reports. It is worrying as there is no way of scientifically finding out its exact population and the actual reasons for its decline, he added. However, in some pockets, the friendly birds may be making a comeback. A local estimation of sparrow population, conducted every year by the Institute for Wildlife Science (IWS) at Lucknow University, has shown a slight rise in population. “The sparrow population in Lucknow increased to 15,324 in 2020 as against 11,675 in 2019. It is an outcome of people’s active participation in sparrow conservation programme,” said Dr Amita Kannaujia, a professor at IWS. Talking with TOI over the phone, Prakash blamed unfriendly architectural designing of present-day houses with no place for these tiny birds to peck grain or make a nest as an important reason for its gradual disappearance. Use of chemical fertilizers and insecticides is another factor for the dwindling sparrow population. Referring to a study carried out in the United Kingdom recently, Prakash said thousands of sparrow chicks died of starvation as they survive only on the insects’ larvae for the first five days after hatching out of the egg. They could not be fed by the mother birds as insects are killed on a massive level due use of chemical spray in lawns, kitchen gardens and agricultural fields,” he said. Ashok Kumar Tiwari, director of the Central Avian Research Institute (CARI) in Bareilly, was of the view that changing lifestyle of humans had adversely impacted these birds. The possible effect of mobile towers on air waves and use of household electrical appliances like air conditioners could have affected the sparrow. He also attributed increased noise and air pollution as possible causes for disturbing the birds. On Saturday, Pilibhit DM Pulkit Khare put up nest boxes on trees on the collectorate campus and his camp office to spread awareness about reviving the bird on the occasion of the World Sparrow Day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/world-sparrow-day-scientific-study-on-sharp-decline-in-sparrow-population-urgently-needed-in-india-says-bnhs-expert/articleshow/81608021.cms||Keshav Agarwal

However, other measures will be taken. Rupani while talking to media persons, said , “I have ordered to make ready five times the number of beds compared to current number of Covid19 cases. We are reviewing the situation on a day-to-day basis. Rupani claimed that the sudden jump in Covid 19 cases are not due to the recently concluded local body elections. He said, “The states where there was no election have witnessed even higher number of cases compared to Gujarat.’’ The CM said, ‘Covid spread has increased across the country. Many states have even worse situation and more cases compared to Gujarat. We in Gujarat completed elections. “In the months of January and February, the number of cases was less. But from March onwards, the pandemic has spread further across the country with its worst in Maharashtra, Punjab etc, places where there were no elections.” He further said, ‘To control cases we have taken some strict, immediate and timely actions. But no lockdown is going to happen. There’s no daytime curfew.

---||Kochi||Centre’s new consumer plaint portal impractical: KSCDRC||Thiruvananthapuram: Kerala state consumer disputes redressal commission (KSCDRC) has turned down the central consumer affairs department’s directive to adopt a centrally-developed web interface to receive consumer complaints. The Union consumer affairs department, through the state government, had asked the commission to use a website — www.edaakil.nic.in — developed by National Informatics Centre to receive complaints from the public. However, the commission has found the web interface a cumbersome one that would make complaint registration an unnecessarily arduous task. The website in English has no local language interface and it also failed to stick to the legal procedures mandatory while processing an application submitted under the provisions in consumer protection act. “The website does not mention how the complainant’s case is to be admitted. Section 36 of the Act provides for a mandatory procedure of admission of each complaint. The commission would issue notice to the opposite parties only after admitting the complaint. But the website makers have completely ignored the formality of consideration of admissibility of the complaint. Besides, no scrutiny section is provided in the website,” commission pointed out in a letter to the central consumer affairs department. The objective of the online system is to be user-friendly and cost effective. However, the web interface recommended by the central consumer affairs department would not only complicate the complaint registration procedure, but would also make the process costly for the general public. Filing a complaint through the web interface would cost at least Rs 1,000 to an ordinary person without computer proficiency. However, the consumer protection act itself encourages the consumers to file their complaints without paying even a penny, for consideration paid up to Rs 5 lakhs, the letter to the central consumer affairs department said. “No person can file a petition without the assistance of an expert. It is doubtful whether even computer centre staff would be familiar with such processes. The website www.edaakhil.nic is not easy, not user-friendly and expensive. Hence, we are not able to implement it in Kerala. It is therefore requested that a cost-free user-friendly website created after proper discussion with the presidents of the commissions, consumers and the legal fraternity may be established,” the commission letter said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/centres-new-consumer-plaint-portal-impractical-kscdrc/articleshow/81608507.cms||B S Anilkumar

For 11 rounds, they remained unbeaten and were overwhelming favourites to win their third title. Even after losing two consecutive games, Churchill’s fate was still in their own hands, but a 1-1 draw against TRAU at the Kishore Bharati Krirangan in Kolkata on Friday has changed equations. Churchill (26 points) are now second on the table, behind Gokulam Kerala FC, who raced to the top after scripting a 2-1 win over Punjab FC. Should both teams have the same number of points, Kerala will finish ahead, thanks to their better head-to-head record (lost 2-3 and won 3-0).  TRAU also have 26 points and will emerge champions if they defeat Gokulam Kerala in the concluding league clash on Saturday. While TRAU’s head-to-head record with Churchill is the same – two draws – they have a superior goal difference (plus 11, compared to Churchill’s plus 4). It could well have been different. In the losses against Kerala (0-3) and Mohammedan Sporting (1-4), Churchill looked terribly out of place. That wasn’t the case against TRAU on Sunday. The former champions were the better side, created plenty of chances, and even though they took the lead through Luka Majcen’s penalty in the 28th minute, TRAU equalised through captain Phalguni Singh in the 43rd minute. Churchill never really recovered from that blow. Of course, they pushed hard for the winner in the second session. Wendell Coelho even hit the crossbar with a curling shot from outside the box. Two minutes later, Kingslee Fernandes found Luka inside the box, but he shot wide of the target. Clayvin Zuniga also came agonisingly close but his shot couldn’t find a way past a maze of TRAU legs, desperate to protect their citadel. At the other end, with Komron Tursunov on international duty for Tajikistan, TRAU struggled to create as many openings as they would have liked. Joseph Olaleye did try, while Bidyashagar Singh’s only attempt on goal was a tame one. Bidyashagar, though, had a major role in securing the equaliser. It was a through ball from the leading goal-scorer that split the defensive pairing of Hamza Kheir and Keenan Almeida. Phalguni timed his run to perfection, and with defenders in hot pursuit, finished calmly past the rival goalkeeper. TRAU could have grabbed all three points with just a minute left on the clock. Joseph did well to spot Bidyashagar’s run. But with just the goalkeeper to beat, the striker tried to dribble past, only for Shibinraj to rescue his team with a neat dive. Churchill will know they messed this title race. All that they can now do is hope Gokulam Kerala and TRAU draw their last league clash. And they win, something they haven’t managed to do for the last three matches.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/i-league-title-slips-out-of-churchills-tight-grasp-after-draw-against-trau/articleshow/81620776.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

ED’s plea said the IAS officer, who was principal chief secretary to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan when the alleged gold smuggling came to light, attempted to sabotage the case using his influence since obtaining bail. ED also cited the threat raised by the state government of registering a case against ED officials and said such a move makes it difficult for officials to perform their duty. The apex court is presently considering an appeal filed by ED challenging the Kerala high court’s order granting bail to the senior IAS official. At the admission hearing, the apex court had declined to issue a stay on the high court’s order. In the latest plea, filed by Jitendra Kumar Gogia, deputy director at ED headquarters, it is alleged that Sivasankar tried to interfere with the probe being conducted by the department while out on bail. It is alleged that Sivasankar attempted to forge evidence against the ED officials involved in the case. Statements given by two women police officers, who were safeguarding key accused Swapna Suresh, against ED has been cited in the petition before the Supreme Court. In their statements, the woman police officers had stated that ED officials coerced Swapna into giving statement against the chief minister and their statements were leaked to media, ED points out. Swapna had later said that she had not faced any pressure to give the statement, ED’s plea said. Statement given by another accused, Sandeep Nair, that ED forced him to give statement against the chief minister has also been challenged by ED in the plea. He was not interrogated by ED when he was in judicial custody, the petition said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ed-presses-for-cancellation-of-sivasankars-bail-in-sc/articleshow/81608514.cms||---

However, officials say that commuters may face issues on the stretch due to the construction work. A PWD official said that the stretch is one of the most congested ones and needs immediate attention. The work on the second one will begin after the first one is made. A senior traffic police official said that a joint meeting of Vivek Vihar traffic circle officials, PWD, NGO Guru Hanuman Society of India identified the civil changes for converting Surya Nagar and Ram Prasth intersections into back to back U-turns in order to provide signal and congestion-free movement for commuters. Under this plan, officials have proposed opening of U-turn between fourth and fifth street light poles from the FOB. Apart from this, the central verge of the main carriageway at Ram Prasth intersection will be closed. The U-turns between fourth and fifth street light poles between Ram Prasth and Surya Nagar intersections will also be opened. The central verge on the main carriageway at Surya Nagar intersection will also be closed and the U-turn between the third and fourth street light poles from the Surya Nagar intersection will be opened. The official said that necessary temporary road signages guiding commuters about the ongoing trail will also be provided, like ‘turn left’, ‘U-turn ahead’, etc. “After conducting the trials and analyzing the outcomes, permanent infrastructure will be provided to make the drive on this stretch hassle free,” said an official. This is the short term plan, while the long term plan is that of construction of a flyover on this stretch to cater to the heavy volume of traffic that is seen here every day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/u-turn-work-for-isbt-stretch-on/articleshow/81609547.cms||---

The last date for submission of Expression of Interest (EOI) to the Sabarmati River Front Development Corporation Limited (SRFDCL) was February 20. It was in February 2017 that the state government had approved the volumetric general development control regulations for the riverfront. The SRFDCL project is being developed on approximately 500 acres of land. Nearly 85 % of the project area will be utilised for public infrastructure, recreational parks, sports facilities and gardens claimed the official proposal. The remaining 14% of the land is proposed to be sold to private parties for constructing high-quality buildings. There are 51 plots on either side of the riverfront. SRFDCL officials are tight-lipped about the bidders, but reveal that a significant number of bidders are from outside Gujarat. “The information about the bidders cannot be shared owing to the confidentiality involved. But since 2017 we have seen more companies outside the state bid for the project,” says a senior official at SRFDCL. The riverfront authorities had appointed Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL), international property consultants, for providing consultancy services for preparing land monetization strategy and sale and auction of development rights of built-up area of the plots in SRFDCL project area. By the end of 2016 the state revenue department had assigned revenue numbers to 185 hectares of reclaimed land on the riverfront. Apart from recovering the project cost of Rs 1,400 crore, the civic body expects to earn profits from the sale of land. Sources in the AMC said that the civic body expects to earn about Rs 3,500 crore through the sale of the reclaimed land.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/28-firms-keen-to-bid-for-riverfront-plots/articleshow/81608994.cms||---

It asserted that Ishrat also had link with Lashkar-e-Taiba, “...from the records as placed by the CBI, it transpires that the deceased Ishrat Jahan was member of Lashkar-e-Taiba wherein Lahore based Ghazwa Times, mouthpiece of Lashkar-e-Taiba, had claimed her as a women activist of Lashkar –e–Taiba.”The government further said, “The official duty of DG Vanzara required him to act against the imminent terrorist threat to the State. The deceased persons were acting as part of pre-planned conspiracy to perpetrate acts of terror in Gujarat.”The state government also questioned the authenticity of CBI witnesses and said that no motive was attributed to Vanzara for the purported acts of omission as alleged by the CBI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/govt-denied-vanzaras-sanction-in-larger-public-interest/articleshow/81609000.cms||---

The train driver had applied emergency brakes, but the couple could not be saved, sources said. The couple were identified as Shalini, 21, and Pawan Kumar, 22. They were residents of Nigohi area and both belonged to the same community. They were pursuing graduation and wanted to marry each other, but their families were against the relationship. The woman’s marriage was fixed elsewhere. Police later found their remains on the rail track, disfigured by the impact of the heavy wheels. The remains have been sent for postmortem by Sadar Bazar police. The woman’s kin levelled allegations that Pawan had forced Shalini to take the extreme step, but failed to provide any evidence. This is the 21st such case of couple suicide reported since 2019 in four districts of Bareilly division, and there were several cases of individual suicides and nearly 10 cases of honour killings. Such cases are probably there in other parts of the state as well, sources added. A senior cop, on the condition of anonymity, said, “In most cases, the couple belonged to same religion and were educated, but the differences between the families proved too fatal. In case of elopement, the woman’s family usually comes forward and registers an abduction FIR against all the youth's kin.” IG Bareilly range Rajesh Pandey told TOI, “This was tragic. An adult has all the right to marry a person of his/her choice. In such case, I have already directed the officials to provide counselling to the adult couple and even provide them security if they sense any threat from their families after wedding." Two married couples have already been given security by police in Bareilly on their request, Pandey said, adding, "I would appeal to the parents not to force their children to marriage against their wish. Let them take their time."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/young-couple-jumps-in-front-of-speeding-train-in-up-after-family-opposes-marriage/articleshow/81608035.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Vinodhini has been summoned in connection with the investigations related to the missing iPhone, which was among six such devices allegedly given away by Unitac builders managing director Santhosh Eapen, one of the beneficiaries in the controversial Life Mission flat project at Wadakkancherry. The Customs claims that it has found links between the IMEI number of the iPhone and a SIM card in the name of Vinodhini. Customs officials said they have served the second notice to Vinodhini at her apartment where she resides as against the first notice which was delivered at her son Bineesh Kodiyeri’s residence. Customs officials also mailed her the second notice and sent it on WhatsApp. Santhosh Eapen however has refuted the claims of Customs stating he had not gifted the said iPhone to anyone and it was in his possession. Regarding his wife’s case, Balakrishnan told the media on Friday: “She has not been given any notice. She does not even know Eapen. The IMEI number of that particular phone is in possession of Eapen only. We do not have any phone that has been gifted. We have the bills of our phones.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/customs-serves-second-notice-to-vinodhini/articleshow/81608524.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Relief for doctor as court accepts police closure report in ‘lapsed licence’ case||MUMBAI: A sessions court this week upheld a lower court’s order, accepting the closure report submitted by cops in a criminal case where city-based Dr Murarilal Saraf was accused of practising without a valid medical licence. Colaba resident Nandini Suchde (55) had accused doctors of medical negligence after her mother Geetika Ghosh died days after she was operated for a fractured femur at a south Mumbai hospital in January 2013. Suchde alleged that Saraf’s registration was cancelled in 1988 by Maharashtra Medical Council, despite which he was practising till the date of the operation and this amounted to cheating. She moved sessions court in 2018 against the magistrate court’s 2017 order accepting the police’s C Summary report which is filed when a case is filed due to “mistake of facts” or they find that it amounts to a civil case. Saraf’s lawyer said he had been registered under Indian Medical Council Act, and that registration has never lapsed. He submitted that renewal of registration with Maharashtra Medical Council was also later done with penalty. The sessions court dismissed Suchde’s plea. It observed that there was no evidence to show that Saraf had intentionally deceived Suchde or her mother. “...there is no dispute about qualification of respondent no 3 [Saraf] as doctor. There is no evidence on record which goes to show that this is a case medical negligence on the part of doctor while treating his patient. As such, no prima facie case is made out... under section 420 (cheating),” the court said. It pointed out that under Maharashtra Medical Practitioners (MMP) Act, practitioners can be barred unless their names are in the register maintained under the act or the register of list prepared under Bombay Homeopathic Act or registers maintained under Maharashtra Medical Council Act or Indian Medical Register. The sessions court said that the MMP Act does not mandate that the person who wants to practise medicine has to register with all four authorities. “...as per report submitted by the police... it appears that respondent no 3 [Saraf] since 1971 till date remains registered with Indian Medical Council... and therefore has been registered as provided under the MMP Act...” the sessions court said. The court also quoted the magistrate’s order in which it was held that lapse in registration is not criminal lapse, but can be professional misconduct. “I do agree the lapse for the period 1988 to October, 2013 is not criminal lapse and so for as professional misconduct is concerned it is for the departmental authority to decide,” the sessions court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/relief-for-doc-as-court-accepts-police-closure-report-in-lapsed-licence-case-in-mumbai/articleshow/81610060.cms||Rebecca Samervel

Experts said cases were expected to remain on the higher side, considering the massive rise in testing, and people needed to abide by Covid-appropriate behaviour. A total of 14,484 samples were tested in the Pune municipal limits, followed by the Pimpri Chinchwad and rural areas at 5,349 and 3,650 tests, respectively. With this, the region’s total testing jumped above 26 lakh mark on Saturday. A report released by district health officer Bhagwan Pawar stated that the PMC areas added 3,111 new patients on Saturday, while the PCMC and rural areas recorded 1,431 and 931 cases of Covid-19, respectively. The cases have been on the rise since last few days in the region. On Friday, the daily tally had jumped above 5,000. For second consecutive day, the region reported more than 5,000 cases on Saturday. The region reported 2,138 recoveries on Saturday, of whom 1,094 patients were discharged in the PMC limits, 623 in the PCMC areas, while 421 patients were declared cured in the rural and cantonment areas. The region’s death tally increased to 9,537 after 27 patients succumbed to the infection on Saturday. Of these, the PMC areas reported 16 deaths, while seven patients died in the PCMC areas. Four deaths were reported in the rural areas of the district. The tally of active patients in the region jumped to 36,267 on Saturday, following an increase in daily cases. As many as 21,630 patients were in home isolation and 14,637 patients were admitted to the hospitals, the report by DHO stated. Health experts have said time and again that masks and social distance were vital to keep the cases in check. “Even if the vaccine has come out, people still needed to stay cautious and abide by Covid-appropriate behaviour as body takes time to develop antibodies against the infection. Secondly, none of the vaccines promise 100% immunity against the virus,” a health expert said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/daily-testing-surge-to-fresh-peak-pushes-tally-to-new-high/articleshow/81609007.cms||Sarang Dastane

At present, the court has permitted him to stay out of Gujarat from March 8 to March 22. However, Patel’s advocate Rafik Lokhandwala filed another application and sought permission from the court to allow him to move outside Gujarat for six months and till then the court was requested to suspend the bail condition that Patel cannot leave Gujarat without the court’s prior permission. The state government opposed the plea, but additional sessions judge B J Ganatra rejected the objections and lifted restrictions of Patel’s movement from March 23 to June 23. Patel has been seeking permission to move out of Gujarat to consult lawyers in Delhi for pending cases in the Supreme Court and to attend political functions. Last week, the Gujarat high court refused to permanently suspend restrictions imposed on Patel’s movement outside Gujarat without court’s permission. This restrictions were imposed in in January 2020 by the court that hears the sedition case after Patel skipped various hearings in the case lodged against him and four others by Ahmedabad crime branch in 2015.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hardik-gets-3-month-nod-to-leave-guj/articleshow/81609003.cms||---
---||Mumbai||47,800 to be tested every day at crowded places in Mumbai||MUMBAI: A day after announcing its plan to conduct rapid antigen tests (RATs) randomly at crowded places in Mumbai, the BMC on Saturday released a circular stating the contours of the exercise. The RAT test will be done randomly, without the consent of persons present at these places. If anyone refuses to undergo the test, an offence will be registered under the Epidemic Act of 1897 and action initiated. The cost incurred on the RAT at malls will be borne by the visitor. If any visitor refuses to get tested or pay the charge, an offence will be registered under the Epidemic Act 1897. Times ViewRamping up testing is a good move as it would help the BMC speedily track, isolate and treat Covid-19 patients. But the BMC is planning to mainly use antigen tests, which have a low sensitivity rate and are known for false negative results. As a fallout, a clear picture of the infection may not be available. As its own staff is stretched, the BMC will have to spend extra to rope in additional manpower and machinery to conduct the 47,800 antigen tests daily.At other crowded places, the cost of the RAT will be borne by the BMC. The circular does not state the cost, but officials said it would be about Rs 250. The testing circular, signed by the municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal, states: “The assistant municipal commissioners are hereby directed to conduct the rapid antigen test and ensure that their daily target is achieved.” All the 24 municipal wards in the city have been given a target of conducting 47,800 tests every day. The target for RATs in every ward depends on the number of malls, railway stations, bus depots and other such places of public gathering that exist in it. Each ward should conduct 400 random RATs per mall per day. There will be 1,000 tests conducted daily at each one of nine major railway stations. Eight of these were CSMT, Mumbai Central, Dadar (Central), Dadar (Western), Bandra Terminus, Andheri, Borivli, LTT Kurla. The ninth station was not named. There will be 1,000 tests daily at each one of four MSRTC bus depots, which are Mumbai Central, Parel, Borivli and Kurla. Another 24,000 tests will be conducted at other crowded places like khau gullies, hawking spots, marketplaces, tourist places, various government offices and restaurants. A RAT gives the result in 30 minutes but has lower sensitivity than the RT-PCR test. Mayor Kishori Pednekar and deputy mayor Suhas Wadkar visited Oberoi mall in Goregaon on Saturday. Pednekar said that in view of the rising cases, every shopkeeper should be given a face shield and asked to follow the government guidelines. She said visitors must wear face masks and maintain physical distance. With the crowd growing at the flower market in Dadar, the G-North ward conducted RT-PCR tests on 215 persons, including licensed vendors and wholesellers. There were six positive results, all labourers. They were sent to institutional quarantine in Vanita Samaj hall in Dadar, a Covid care centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/47800-to-be-tested-every-day-at-crowded-places-in-mumbai/articleshow/81609544.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Ahmedabad||Covid mediclaim forgery: Four booked||Ahmedabad: The senior manager of the legal department of Shalby Hospital on Saturday filed a complaint alleging criminal breach of trust, cheating, forgery and conspiracy against two employees and two mediclaim applicants. Hitarth Dhebar, 40, the senior legal manager of the hospital in his FIR stated that their Bopal branch, Krishna Shalby Hospital, had on March 9 received an email from Med Sewa TPA seeking more information regarding a mediclaim application for Covid treatment from one Yatin N Maniyar. When the Krishna Shalby team checked their records, they found no Yatin N Maniyar had been treated. They had not issued any such documents either. Dhebar stated that as their audit team scrutinized the mediclaim file, they learned that the MRN number stated in the account summary for the file of Maniyar was actually assigned to a patient named Harsha Joshi. On privately probing which of their employees was in touch with Maniyar, they learned that a senior executive in their corporate development team, Mihir Agrawal, was a friend of Maniyar's. According to the FIR, the hospital then began inquiring into the creation of such bogus mediclaim files. Various senior functionaries of the hospital then met and decided to question Agrawal about the mediclaim file. He was summoned and after some evasive replies he confessed to having created this mediclaim file with the help of Bhavik Nimawat, an assistant manager in the mediclaim department. The complaint stated that Nimawat was also called and questioned and he confessed to having helped create the file. On asking whether they created any other such fraudulent mediclaim files, they confessed to having made one for Atul Kaneria, who is a friend of the complainant’s, showing treatment for Covid. The two employees gave the hospital authorities a statement to this effect in writing. The hospital senior management then decided to file an FIR in this matter and Dhebar then filed the complaint against Agrawal, Nimawat, Maniyar and Kaneria at Anandnagar police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/covid-mediclaim-forgery-four-booked/articleshow/81609008.cms||---

The cantonment had only 12 Covid positive cases on March 12. Now the number of cases has gone up to 141, officials said. Dr VD Gaikwad, resident medical officer, PCB, said, “Positive cases are coming from all across the cantonment limits. We did not notice this kind of trend during the peak of the virus last year. That time, the cases were mainly from slum pockets.” Convent street, New Modikhana and Solapur bazaar are worst affected localities as maximum Covid cases are being reported from there. “At least 10 cases are getting reported from these three localities for the last few days, which is worrisome for us,” added Gaikwad. The Saradar Vallabhbhai Patel Cantonment General hospital has capacity for 20 oxygen and 20 ICU beds. “Maximum patients from our area are asymptomatic and, hence, they are home isolated, while some of the patients are being treated at private hospitals. Our Covid ward is now full,” said a cantonment official. The PCB is currently facing a huge financial crunch and doesn’t have funds to restart its Covid Care Centre (CCC). “We have demanded Rs1.6 crore grant from the district administration to set up Covid facilities here. The proposal is still pending with them. We are hopeful of getting the aid,” said Gaikwad, who is pursuing the matter with the administration. Covid cases in cantonment were in single digit in January. “Increase in cases in neighbouring municipal limits and intermingling with local populace for work have led to a surge in positive cases,” said Amit Kumar, chief executive officer, PCB.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/covid-positive-cases-rise-by-10-times-in-a-week-in-pune-cantt/articleshow/81609015.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Reality check: Excuses galore in market where few wear mask||Bhopal: Though new Covid-19 cases are touching new highs in Bhopal every day, casual approach towards social distancing norms continues. During a spot check at Indrapuri, adherence to Covid-19 norms was found totally missing. People were without masks. Even those having it were not wearing it properly. Even shopkeepers at the busy market situated in BHEL seemed to be least bothered about the spread of the virus.When asked about masked and social distancing, customers as well as shopkeepers came up with a list of excuses. “You can not wear mask all the time through the day. I have removed it and you appeared in front of me. Aren’t we suppose to get some fresh air for sometime?” reacted a customer. Ironically, he could not be seen wearing his mask for a couple of hours he was in the market. He refused to divulge his name. Social distancing is the biggest victim as citizens refused to follow it. “Tell me where social distancing is being followed. I am wearing mask and I think this enough,” reacted Rakesh Gurung, a resident of Indrapuri. Masks wearing on several faces were also found casually. “Whenever I go to a crowded place, I do wear my mask but I remove it sometimes. I can’t wear mask all the time,” said another citizen when he was asked the reason for not wearing a mask. Majority of the retired citizens were spotted wearing mask. “I am afraid as to why youngsters refuse to follow the Covid protocol. What is wrong in wearing a mask all the time. After all, it is for your own safety,” said Nikhil Singh, a retired government employee. Even several people were spotted objecting others not follwing the Covid norms. “I do not hesitate in calling even the cops if I see anyone around me refusing to wear a mask. When I can do it a this age of 76, why can’t others do the same. It is good or everyone’s safety,” said Yogesh Nema, a retired bank officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/reality-check-excuses-galore-in-market-where-few-wear-mask/articleshow/81609006.cms||Ramendra Singh

---||India||Tamil Nadu elections: Same woman on AIADMK, DMK posters||TRICHY: It’s a dubious commonality the AIADMK and the DMK could have done without. Picture of the same sari-clad woman has been used by both the arch-rivals in their digital campaigns for the assembly poll to woo voters. The posters, which also have the pictures of chief ministerial candidates Edappadi K Palaniswami and M K Stalin, have now sparked a war of words between the IT wings of both the parties. After DMK chief Stalin released the vision document of the party at a political rally in Trichy on March 7, the party’s IT wing was quick to make digital posters explaining the promises. Under the banner “Valarum Vaaipugal Valamana Tamil Nadu” (growing opportunities, prosperous Tamil Nadu), DMK functionaries shared a digital poster showing a sari-clad model posing with a smile. The posters were shared widely on social media and DMK’s pages. Meanwhile, a few days ago, the AIADMK’s IT wing published a few digital posters in which the same woman found a place. The posters shared on the official FB page of the AIADMK IT wing appealed to women heads of families to elect AIADMK by listing out various welfare schemes promised. “Not just the election manifesto, it seems AIADMK is copying even our innovation. We have the copyright for the image of the woman used in our posters,” a state-level functionary of DMK IT wing said. Rejecting the accusation, AIADMK functionaries said the photograph of the model was not exclusive. “We were the first to use the model’s picture in the state government’s advertisements in January. DMK has copied from us but claims it as their own,” V V R Raj Satyen, secretary, Madurai zone of AIADMK’s IT wing, told TOI. Interestingly, a search with the keyword ‘Tamil woman’ in Shutterstock, a stock photography website, leads to the picture of the woman model used in both posters. The portraits of the model were shared by a handle called AJP. N Karthikeyan, a cybercrime advocate in Madras high court, said that anyone can purchase photographs from a stock photography website. “There are two types of purchases of photographs - through exclusive licence and non-exclusive licence. The latter can be used by multiple people after paying a minimal fee. But exclusively licensed pictures cannot be used that way,” Karthikeyan said. The striking similarity in the posters has brought back memories of the goof-up during the 2016 assembly election when both AIADMK and DMK hired the same senior citizen for their respective video campaigns targeting each other.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/whats-common-between-dmk-aiadmk-its-their-poster-woman/articleshow/81623678.cms||Deepak Karthik

---||Goa||Undercurrents simmer as Panaji misses usual buzz||PANAJI: The excitement that is usually palpable whenever the capital city gets into an election was lacking for the Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) polls. Beneath the facade of indifferent calm, it was evident that this election was anything but a straight forward event. For the first time in several years, the civic polls were held without former CM Manohar Parrikar. He was the Panaji MLA and used to be the rallying point for BJP karyakartas, councillors and neutral voters. Parrikar had the ability to iron out personal issues and formulate political equations where least expected, a skill that BJP sorely missed this time around. This is also the first time that Atanasio ‘Babush’ Monserrate has fielded a panel as the Panaji MLA and BJP member. Monserrate has held sway over CCP for three terms despite being the MLA of St Cruz or Taleigao, and was either with Congress or an independent MLA. But what made the elections most interesting is the visible discord within the BJP camp. “As far as BJP is concerned, 100% of the karyakartas and supporters are not with me. Just 50% are with me, but it is no problem whatsoever. They are immaterial,” Monserrate said while visiting polling booths on a two-wheeler. St Cruz MLA Antonio Fernandes was also seen moving about on a motorcycle taking stock of the polling trends. “I have the responsibility for wards 18 and 19, and since 2006 I have been overseeing these two wards. Whether he was in BJP or Congress, Babush’s panel has always emerged victorious,” he said.  The BJP old guard is sore after Monserrate denied tickets to some of the earlier councillors and senior BJP karyakartas. As one lady put it outside the Massano De Amorim polling booth, BJP of today bears a stark difference from its earlier avatar. “After Parrikar died, the party is no longer the same and the karyakartas have broken up,” said the traditional BJP supporter, who now found herself torn between the official BJP candidate and a personal acquaintance. What may also work against Monserrate is the sense of betrayal among many who had strongly supported him when he contested the 2019 byelection as a Congress candidate. “ There is a lot of silent voting that is taking place, but it has to be seen who benefits,” said a CCP employee. Most eyes will be on four wards of Mala, three wards of Ribandar and some wards in the city where punters expect the BJP-backed panel to struggle. “The people are angry. Silent voting will benefit us,” said outgoing BJP councillor Menino Da Cruz, who has taken personal responsibility for four wards in Mala. Cruz said that scores of upset BJP karyakartas worked against the BJP-backed panel in order to send a stern message to BJP for “surrendering” to Monserrate. In addition to the rebel BJP candidates, independent candidates and the We Ponjekars panel are also in the fray for the 30 wards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/undercurrents-simmer-as-panaji-misses-usual-buzz/articleshow/81609556.cms||Newton Sequeira

---||Ahmedabad||BJP, Congress spar over terms used for tribals||Gandhinagar: Congress on Saturday asked the BJP government in the Gujarat assembly to stop using the words like “vanvasi” and “vanbandhu” while referring to tribals, claiming that these terms were unconstitutional and derogatory.The Congress asked the state government to refer to the tribal community as just “adivasi” and issue a circular in this regard.State Tribal Welfare minister Ganpat Vasava said these words had been used since ages and even the previous Congress governments in the state and the Centre had mentioned the words “vanbandhu” and “vanvasi” in tribal welfare schemes.“These words are used only in some tribal welfare schemes such as Vanbandhu Kalyan Yojana. Our government has not issued any circular to replace the word adivasi with 'vanvasi' and 'vanbandhu',” Vasava said, while responding to a question in the assembly.“The BJP has not coined these words. On the contrary, they were in use since 1976 when the Congress was in power in Gujarat,” he said.In 2006, the Congress government at the Centre had also used the word forest-dwelling scheduled tribe, which means “vanvasi” in Gujarati, the minister said.Congress MLA Chandrika Bariya claimed that the use of these words has hurt the sentiments of tribals, while another tribal MLA Anil Joshiara asked the government to ban these words and use only adivasi to refer to tribals.Leader of opposition, Paresh Dhanani, even claimed that the word “vanvasi” is ambiguous.“Outsiders will start claiming to be vanvasi after shifting to forest areas. They will eventually term themselves as tribals and snatch the rights of real adivasis,” Dhanani said.Responding to this, the minister said, “No one can become a tribal just because he starts living in a forest. We have a strict act to keep a check on it. The fact remains that the Congress never cared for tribals in the past,” the minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/bjp-congress-spar-over-terms-used-for-tribals/articleshow/81609017.cms||---

---||Delhi||DU clears 3 teachers with warning||New Delhi: After debarring three teachers from administrative duties, the University of Delhi has decided to clear the teachers after a warning. The debarment came last year over a tussle between appointment of pro vice-chancellors and registrars by two factions in DU in a bid to take over administrative control. On October 21, 2020, former DU vice-chancellor Yogesh Tyagi who was on leave for medical reasons appointed a new acting registrar, P C Jha, at an Executive Council (EC) meeting. However, P C Joshi — the pro vice-chancellor and acting vice-chancellor — found Jha’s appointment to be “illegal” and stated that since Tyagi was on leave, the appointment was not valid. Joshi then held another EC meeting where Vikas Gupta was elected registrar by the council. But in a twist, Tyagi as VC, removed Joshi as Pro VC and replaced him with Geeta Bhatt, also a member of the right-wing teachers’ group National Teachers’ Democratic Front (NDTF). However, both Jha and Bhatt were barred from entering the Viceregal Lodge —the VC’s office. The university had then debarred Bhatt, Jha and another teacher Sunil Kumar during the administrative tussle. In an EC meeting on Thursday, DU removed the debarment and now allows the teachers the opportunity to take up administrative roles. Balaram Pani, dean of colleges, stated that the EC has let them go with just a warning. “The teachers can now take up administrative posts,” Pani said. However, Bhatt and Jha claimed that they are yet to receive any communication on this issue. “Pani said that it will be done once the minutes of the EC meeting are out.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/du-clears-3-teachers-with-warning/articleshow/81609587.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||FIR filed for fake complaint against cops||Ahmedabad: Vasna police early on Friday filed a complaint against one Rahul Chaudhary, 37, for obstructing police in their duty after he called the police control room and allegedly made a false complaint that Vasna police were not registering an FIR. According to the FIR filed by ASI Jitendra Chandrakant, they received a message at 12.30am from a PCR van regarding a call made by one Daksh Malviya, 20, a resident of Azam Society, Jivraj Park, about a fight with an opposing party. According to the FIR, at the police station, they were told that both parties had reached a compromise and Malviya even made an application stating that he did not want to file an FIR. At about 2.10pm, they got another message from the police control room, stating that one Rahul Chaudhary had complained that Vasna police were not registering an FIR and had put a person in need of medical assistance in the lock-up. The ASI then inquired with Malviya and learned that Rahul Chaudhary was his uncle and he was outside the police station. Chaudhary was called in and asked to explain why he made the false complaint. He stated that he felt that the Vasna cops had detained Malviya. Vasna police then booked Chaudhary under Section 186 and Section 177 of IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/fir-filed-for-fake-complaint-against-cops/articleshow/81609019.cms||---

Senior citizens struggled to climb up the stairs and took the aid of their relatives or bystanders in order to enter the polling stations. Every polling station had a wheelchair but, there was no volunteer to offer the wheelchair to the old and those with restricted mobility. The task, said some officials, has been left up to police personnel who did not take too kindly to be delegated with the duty. “We have been asked to check people’s temperature and then they want us to take old people in the wheelchair. Is that what the police are meant for? Where are the polling staff,” said a police constable at ward number 9 polling station. For the Lok Sabha elections and state elections, students were drafted in as volunteers to assist the senior citizens. Several candidates and polling agents at the Massano de Amorim said that though there a wheelchair has been kept on site, the steep ramp and lack of assistance left the wheelchair unused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/wheelchairs-remain-idle-elderly-struggle/articleshow/81609575.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||15% of 688 big cat deaths in Gujarat unnatural: House told||AHMEDABAD: About 15% of the deaths of the state’s big cats, including leopards and lions, have been deemed unnatural. Over the past two years, 23 lions and 83 leopards have died of unnatural causes. Overall, 688 big cats — including 313 lions — have died in the state from January 1, 2019, to December 31, 2020. The state government tabled the data in response to a question from Dasada MLA Naushad Solanki (the Congress). The government data reveals that in the case of Asiatic lions, of the 313 deaths, only 23 were unnatural. This was 7.3% of the total deaths. But among the leopards, of the 375 deaths, 22.1% were unnatural. The unnatural deaths cover cases such as being hit by trains and vehicles, falling into wells, or coming into contact with electrified fences. The data tabled in the assembly reveals that unnatural deaths among the lions almost doubled in 2020 as compared to 2019. In 2019, seven unnatural deaths were reported but in 2020 the number was 16. The data shows that of the 23 lions that died, two were males, 13 were females, and eight were cubs. As for the leopards, accidental deaths showed a decline: in 2019 the number was 49 and in 2020 it was 34; a drop of about 30%. A senior officer from the forest department said the data indicated that the population of the big cats in the state was higher than the government was willing to declare. Or, the officer said, the data suggested that all was not well with the big cats in the state. Another senior officer said that the state government had recently announced an ungulate-breeding park to increase the prey base in Gir and nearby areas. This was done to ensure that the big cats do not venture out in search of food. Sanctuaries are getting overcrowded and hence leopards and lions are foraying into new territories. The state now needs to expand the national park to 1,000 sq km from 250-odd sq km and set up more sanctuaries. “We don’t know the exact population of Asiatic lions and leopards in Gujarat. Hence it is difficult to work out their mortality rate,” a lion expert said. “Having said this, 313 lion deaths and 375 leopard deaths over two years looks very high and dangerous given that the Canine Distemper Virus (CDV) has been detected in the past among the animals.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/15-of-688-big-cat-deaths-unnatural-house-told/articleshow/81609023.cms||---

Issuing the directive through the health department, Tope directed the local authorities to keep a tab on the hospitals and initiate action if the rules were not followed. Tope told TOI, “As of now, we have the necessary infrastructure. There is a slight issue regarding beds because some hospitals are admitting non-Covid patients. They would have to follow the 80:20 reservation like the last year and any violations would be dealt with strictly. We have received some complaints from Pune regarding non-availability of beds. The local authorities have been told to update the dashboard.” Pune collector Rajesh Deshmukh said all private hospitals had been told to update bed status on dashboard by Monday. The health minister said even if the Covid cases were on the higher side in the state, nearly 80-90% of the patients were being advised home isolation because they were asymptomatic. He also said the severity of ailment of most of those admitted to hospitals was not as high. Tope said some hospitals were admitting patients with mild Covid symptoms. “We have told them strictly that no mild or moderate cases should be admitted to hospitals,” he said. Tope said the district collectors could seek help of private laboratories to speed up testing if the government-run facilities’ capacity was not enough.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/health-minister-warns-pvt-hospitals-against-admitting-mild-patients-directs-to-follow-8020-reservation/articleshow/81609026.cms||Nisha Nambiar

This was stated in a data tabled by the government in the state assembly in response to a question by a Congress MLA seeking data on RTE admissions in the state in last two years. A total of 4,13,121 students were enrolled in Class 1 in the academic year 2019-20 in private schools across the state. Of these, 25% or 1,04,045 students were to be enrolled under the RTE Act. But the figures released by the education minister shows that 82,726 students only were enrolled, which means that 21,319 students under RTE Act did not get the opportunity, said a Congress official. Similarly, for the year 2020-21, 3,72,411 students were enrolled in the primary section. Against 90,738 seats that were to be reserved for RTE candidates, only 71,527 got admission, according to data tabled in the assembly. Thus, 19,211 RTE candidates could not get admission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/schools-fail-to-enrol-40k-rte-candidates/articleshow/81609028.cms||---

Currently, two UDF constituents have fielded candidates in the constituency while the local Congress leadership has been demanding that a party candidate should contest from the seat and has fielded a rebel candidate. Nationalist Congress Kerala (NCK) has fielded its leader Sulfikar Mayuri as its candidate. The Congress local leadership in Elathur has been strongly opposing his candidature and has fielded rebel Congress leader U V Dinesh Mani. Adding to the trouble, Sennin Rashi, a student leader of Bharatiya National Janata Dal (BNJD) has also filed nomination papers in the constituency. Amid the melee, the meeting attended by KPCC working president K V Thomas failed to reach a consensus. The presidents of the block and mandalam congress committees and office bearers of other affiliated organisations attended the meeting. They raised the demand that Congress should take over the seat. Kozhikode MP, M K Raghavan who attended the meeting, said that NCK didn't have any presence in the constituency and that fielding Mayuri as the UDF candidate will deal a severe blow to the party in the area. He left the meeting mid-way and later told the media that there was no question of accepting Mayuri as the candidate. The DCC offers witnessed altercation when DCC president U Rajeevan told Congress workers who raised a protest to leave the venue. K V Thomas said that he will convey the sentiments of local Congress leaders and workers to the KPCC president and senior leaders and KPCC will take an appropriate decision soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/reconciliation-meet-at-elathur-ends-in-ruckus/articleshow/81609027.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Pune||Maharashtra wants small 20-bed hospitals roped in as vaccine sites||PUNE: The state government is mulling the roping in of small 20-bed hospitals to increase Covid-19 vaccination coverage in urban areas. Officials said the addition of such hospital sites will improve vaccine access for thousands of citizens in the priority groups. Currently, hospitals with at least 200 beds have been allowed to operate as vaccination centres. But several housing societies have demanded more neighbourhood centres. Others have said the vaccines should reach the doorsteps of those who're unable to travel to the centres. Ravindra Sinha, a member of the Baner-Balewadi-Pashan residents' association said senior citizens and many with serious underlying conditions were finding it difficult to reach vaccination sites. "Medical teams should then be able to conduct vaccine camps at housing societies. The move will boost the vaccination rate," he said. Sinha added that some citizen groups and NGOs were now planning to launch an online campaign to urge the Centre to permit universal vaccination in the district. "The state government should also step in to have 'at-home vaccination'," he said. State officials said they are indeed working to expand the number of vaccination sites. “We are looking at smaller facilities that can carry out vaccination to speed up coverage, especially in the urban areas," state health minister Rajesh Tope said. The minister said as of now the state has enough doses to last 10 days, but has been promised more. He said he has demanded a supply of 20 lakh doses every week as the current target is to vaccinate 1.77 crore people (including health workers, frontline staff and citizens from the priority groups). Tope added that the state had first wanted 367 private and government-run hospital sites to administer the Covid vaccines. But only 209 were approved by the Centre. "If the rest get permits, we will be able to improve the pace of vaccination coverage,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/state-wants-small-20-bed-hospitals-roped-in-as-vaccine-sites/articleshow/81609030.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Goa||Fierce battle likely in most Pernem wards||MAPUSA/SALIGAO: With a high polling percentage recorded at the Pernem municipal council polls on Saturday, there could be a fierce fight on the cards in many of the ten wards. The council saw 37 candidates in the fray many of who are news faces, with BJP fielding candidates in all ten wards. From among all the municipal councils that voted on Saturday , the Pernem civic body accounts for the smallest voter base, which has 4,233 voters, 2,148 are male and 2,085 are female. Similarly, 18 female candidates contested these polls. One reason for the intense political activity here was the selection of candidates who have support from BJP. A cold revolt was brewing here as BJP tickets were given to close aides of deputy CM Manohar Ajgaonkar - who had joined BJP from MGP a few years ago. This meant that hardcore BJP workers had to be denied tickets. Sources pointed that people were upset that development took a backseat as all councillors in the previous term enjoyed the two key posts of chairperson or deputy chairperson on rotation. While the chairperson’s post was reserved for women in the last term, it is unreserved this timeand has already seen signs of groupism. Byelections were also held in the key wards of Arambol and Morjim panchayats as well as in a Korgao panchayat ward since the panch member was elected to the zilla panchayat (ZP). Meanwhile, the pandemic did not deter locals of Verla Canca which saw a good voter turnout for the bypoll of ward 6, which was necessitated after former sarpanch Milton Marques died while in office last December. Similarly there was a good voter turnout for the byWpoll in ward 7 of Oxel panchayat which was held due to the former sarpanch’s demise. In Bastora, there was a good voter turnout in ward 4 where elections were held after erstwhile panch Manisha Naik was elected as ZP member.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fierce-battle-likely-in-most-pernem-wards/articleshow/81609583.cms||---

The returning officer heard advocates on behalf of Shaji as well as the representatives of LDF which filed a complaint on behalf of candidate K V Sumesh before taking the decision to accept the nomination. Following the acceptance of his nomination, Shaji said that he was happy with the development as it provided him legal protection. “They are going forward with false narratives. They don’t have anything other than forged documents and manipulated evidence. I am contesting from the same constituency and why aren’t they discussing it there?” Shaji said. CPM Kannur district secretary MV Jayarajan said that the decision of the returning officer to accept the nomination was unfortunate. “If the petition filed by him in Supreme Court is examined, it can be seen that his plea was seeking a cancellation of the high court order which made him ineligible to run for the assembly elections under Section 123 of the Representation of the People Act. The Supreme Court has not even considered this petition. What we can understand from this is that he is still ineligible,” said Jayarajan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/despite-ldf-plaint-shajis-nomination-accepted/articleshow/81609035.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Dehradun||International Day of Forests: Communities which live near forests and are supposed to protect them, have steadily lost footing over the years||DEHRADUN: Lack of involvement of communities living in and around forests, coupled with inadequate resources at their disposal, is what is putting India’s forests at risk, believe experts. Uttarakhand is home to the country’s oldest forest management system, van panchayats (VPs), but only about half of the state’s 11,522 VPs are currently functional. Formed in 1931 under the Indian Forest Act 1927, van panchayats give villagers the power to do what is needed to protect forests. However, the power has successively been curtailed with amendments to the Act in 1976, 2001, 2005 & 2012. It is no different in other forest-rich states like Madhya Pradesh, which has more than 15,228 joint forest management committees (JMPs) and eco-development committees, Maharashtra (which has 12,665 JMPs) and Odisha (which has 12,494 JMPs). Experts say decisions in JMPs are usually taken by forest officials as result of which, role of villagers has become marginalised. India’s forest cover is spread across 21.67% geographic area of the country, which is around 7,12,249 sq km. There are 188 different types of forests in the country. For authorities, the task is to protect these forests from threats of wildfires, climate change, deforestation, encroachment, as well as monitoring the change of land use (which facilitates use of forest land for non-forestry purposes). Padma Shri recipient Jadav Molai Payeng, who received India’s highest civilian honour for turning a 1,400 strip of sandy land along the Brahmaputra in Assam into a dense forest and is known as the ‘Forest Man of India’, said, “There is an urgent need to involve everyone in saving the planet by planting more trees. Our country should start by making good use of the traditional wisdom of forest communities. Involving forest communities in management of forests is just on papers, which shouldn’t be the case.” In a similar vein, Nitin Rai of Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE) Bangalore, added, “Tribals are an integral part of forest management as their way of living involves cultivating forests. Data of almost 150 years collected by Biligiri Rangaswamy Temple (BRT) Tiger Reserve shows that having tribals tend to a forest they are familiar with has great ecological benefits. Valuable species multiply while weeds are kept under control. Unfortunately, since the inception of Indian Forest Act, the focus is on removing these tribes from forests and robbing them of their basic rights.” Citing an example, Rai said, “In BRT as well as Corbett Tiger Reserve, invasive species like Lantana, Kamila, Cramlina and Equatorium have grown all over the forests. This is due to lack of participation of local communities.” Forest authorities of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha and Uttarakhand said that they are working to involve local residents to protect the forests they grew up with. While this arrangement is beneficial for both authorities and local communities, scientists feel these communities need to be trained in technical know-how in dealing with the risks a forest faces.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/international-day-of-forests-communities-which-live-near-forests-and-are-supposed-to-protect-them-have-steadily-lost-footing-over-the-years/articleshow/81608572.cms||Shivani Azad

In response to a question from Chandrikaben Bariya, the Congress MLA from Garbada, the government said the 46 animals included giraffe, zebra (three), wildebeest (three), alpaca (five), and llama and wallaby (four each). Two alpacas, two llamas, and a wallaby have died. The officials said that of the 146 animals and birds brought from various parts of the country, 41 have died. Twenty-nine conures accounted for the maximum deaths. Conures are a diverse, loosely defined group of small- to medium-sized parrots. The state’s weather did not suit the animals brought from other parts of the world. The officials said that these exotic animals were kept in isolation and they were made to adjust to Indian conditions before visitors were allowed in. The Jungle Safari, a tourist attraction at Kevadia, had opened on a trial basis in February last year. But just within a month of its opening, it was closed for tourists due to Covid. The park has over 1,000 animals and birds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/safari-five-of-46-exotic-animals-dead/articleshow/81609038.cms||---
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Vaccination timings likely to be revised to avoid summer heat||PUNE: Health department authorities are now likely to revise Covid vaccination timings at sites across Pune, Solapur and Satara due to rising summer temperatures. Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle , said, "The plan involves hospitals starting early, at 8am, and continuing sessions until noon. There will then be a break and sessions will restart from 4pm to go on till 8pm." Dr Deshmukh added that the revised summer schedule is not mandatory for hospitals. "The centres can tweak timings to what suits them. The aim is to avoid peak afternoon hours. Senior citizens and those with comorbidities cannot be expected to step out in the summer heat,” he said. He added that chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, during a recent meeting, asked all district collectors to pick suitable timings for vaccination during the summer. Thackeray, Dr Deshmukh said, suggested vaccination should be conducted pre-lunch and later in the evenings. The chief minister also said hot summer afternoons could see a drop in turnouts. “We have communicated this to hospitals and the new timings are likely to be adopted as early as possible. This schedule is especially essential for smaller hospital sites that have erected pandals for beneficiaries and where there are no air-conditioners," Dr Deshmukh said. He said for now, vaccination timings have been extended in Pune district, from the current 9.30am to 5.30pm slot to 6.30pm. "Sites in Solapur and Satara are already running on these new timings. Pune is set to follow soon. We have also asked municipal officials to ensure that sites in the open have temporary sheds and drinking water facilities,” Dr Deshmukh said. Dr Ramaswami N, the National Health Mission commissioner, said civic bodies and hospitals are free to select session timings. The state has put no restrictions, he said. “We have already issued a circular that states vaccination timings are flexible and can be tweaked as per local needs. There are no time restrictions,” Dr Ramaswami added. Manjusha Kulkarni , secretary of the Association of Hospitals, Pune, said, “A meeting has been organised between hospitals and PMC to discuss timings for the summer. Tweaking vaccination timings to avoid peak afternoon heat is important for senior citizens. Most bigger hospitals won't have a problem implementing these timings as they have enough staff."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/vaccine-timings-likely-to-be-revised-to-avoid-summer-heat/articleshow/81609037.cms||Neha Madaan

But while these games will be played just three days later, fans are increasingly worried whether they will get to watch the team in action, either on television or any other platform. “We are very confident,” said AIFF general secretary Kushal Das. “We have been in touch with the organisers since the matches were announced (on February 23). The UAE game is not a problem. Our worry is the friendly against Oman. It’s being played in UAE, the broadcast rights are with BeIN Sports and the production is done by Oman TV.” AIFF has already negotiated rights for the UAE friendly with BeIN Sports and remain confident that a solution to the Oman impasse can be found. “Oman TV uplinks to Arabsat, which cannot be downlinked in India. We are trying to figure out which satellite it should be uplinked to. This should be clear in the next 48 hours,” said Das. While Star Sports took to social media last week to confirm they do not have the rights to broadcast the two friendlies in Dubai, AIFF said they may find “another channel.” India are currently preparing for the last leg of the Fifa World Cup qualifiers which will be played in June. Fourth in the group with three points from their first five matches, India are aiming for a third-place finish which will provide them with a direct spot in the third round of the Asian Cup 2023 qualifiers. India will resume their qualifying campaign in Doha. They play Qatar on June 3, before crucial games against Bangladesh (June 7) and Afghanistan (June 15).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/very-confident-of-broadcasting-india-friendlies-in-dubai-aiff/articleshow/81620842.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

---||Kozhikode||Kerala assembly polls 2021: Nominations of NDA candidates rejected in 3 seats||KOZHIKODE/ THRISSUR/ IDUKKI: In a major setback to the NDA, the nomination papers of the BJP candidates in Thalassery and Guruvayur constituencies and the NDA candidate in Devikulam were rejected during the scrutiny on Saturday. The nomination paper of the BJP candidate in Thalassery, N Haridas, who is also the Kannur district president of the party, was rejected by Thalassery sub-collector, who is the returning officer, as the Form A, which is the authorization form to be signed by the party national president, didn’t have the signature. Adding to the party’s worries, the nomination of the party dummy candidate K Lijesh has also been rejected on the same grounds leaving the party with no candidate in Thalassery, where the party has the highest number of political votes in Kannur district. BJP candidate V K Sajeevan had managed to secure 22,125 votes in 2016 elections from the constituency. BJP has been focusing on building the party in Thalassery for long. The vote share of the party has increased from 5.9% (6,973 votes) in 2011 to 16.6% (22,125 votes) in 2016. Haridas said that denying candidature citing technical issues is against the spirit of democracy and the party would approach the Supreme Court on the matter. “The Form A didn’t have the signature of the party national president. When we understood the mistake we secured it online and submitted the form, but the RDO did not accept it. Also, the affidavit that we furnished stating that we will produce the document was turned down,” Haridas said. According to rules, the copies of the forms cannot be accepted as Election Symbols (Reservation and Allotment Order) 1968 says that forms A and B are to be signed, by ink only, by the said office-bearer or person authorised and that no facsimile, signature, etc. shall be accepted and no form transmitted by fax shall be accepted. Meanwhile, CPM Kannur district secretary M V Jayarajan said that the rejection of the papers of the BJP candidate was suspicious and raised doubts of a deal between BJP and Congress. “It is strange that the party which submitted the Form A and Form B authorization letters from the national president and state president in the nearby constituencies of Koothuparamba and Dharmadom could not do it properly in Thalassery,” Jayarajan said. KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran on the other hand alleged a BJP-CPM understanding behind the development. LDF has fielded sitting MLA A N Shamseer in the constituency and the UDF candidate is K P Aravindakshan. The BJP was planning to rope in national leaders for campaign in Thalassery. In Guruvayur, the nomination of the BJP candidate, Niveditha Subramanian, who is also the Mahila Morcha state president, was rejected by the returning officer citing the absence of the signature of the state president in the Form B as the reason. Now, the BJP does not have a candidate in the constituency where it had polled over 25,000 votes in the last assembly poll.  The BJP sources said the party would challenge the decision in the high court, if possible on Sunday itself. Meanwhile, the nomination of the NDA candidate in Devikulam constituency, Dhanalakshmi Marimuthu, was also rejected as she had failed to complete the Form 26 of the nomination.  She was the candidate of AIADMK, an NDA constituent. Dhanalakshmi said that she will approach the Election Commission against the action. S Ganeshan, an independent candidate, whose nomination has been accepted, is now the NDA candidate here.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/three-nominations-of-nda-rejected/articleshow/81609034.cms||---
---||Chennai||Biryani, the hit for all seasons||Chennai: Whether the smoky dark Dindigul version or the veiled spiciness of the Ambur spin-off, biryani is a dish that’s local in flavour but clearly universal in appeal. Bizarrely so, in fact.Earlier this year, it adapted itself into a flavour of popcorn as well. Vishal Gurusami of Chennai-based Binge Pop began offering the biryani-flavoured popcorn, and found that within days of its launch it had become a bestseller. "We do our own seasoning for the popcorn. Clearly, people like biryani in any form," he says.The popcorn joins the bandwagon of recent out-of-the-box fusions of the staple such as biryani-scented attar and biryani pasta. And not to mention the biryani flavoured ice cream (which apparently comes with caramelized onion shavings for garnish!) Clearly, it’s the flavour of every season.Giving an idea of just how much it’s in demand, Swiggy’s 5th Annual StatEATstics report 2020 reveals biryani was ordered more than once every second. In fact, during the lockdown, a large number of users made their debut on the food-ordering app by placing an order for chicken biryani. And now with the elections around the corner, the one-pot meal takes centre stage again at rallies as the surefire route to a voter’s heart — a packet of biryani, the carb-protein dish perfectly poised to raise flagging energy levels.At its most basic level, biryani is just a meal of meat and rice, says socio-cultural anthropologist Dr S Sumathi. "But that little plate holds within it the complexities of Tamil culture and that’s what makes it so popular," she says.In the state, the concept of hospitality or ‘Virunthombal’ is all-important, explains Sumathi. "Both food and culture are interlinked so deeply, one does not exist without the other. At a typical feast, for instance, even the very action of how you close a leaf, towards or away from you, signifies whether the experience was mournful or joyous," she says.In some villages, food serves as a traditional fundraiser. People who are bankrupt take a loan and throw a feast, says Sumathi. "Well-wishers enjoy the meal and place money under the leaf. So the man in debt raises money without loss of face. Food is the common denominator in times of crisis and occasions of joy.""There is a saying in Tamil, veetilai kai nanachitta, vaaku maara kudathu (once you come to the house and eat, you cannot go back on your word), which shows just how closely food and honour are connected. Also what makes food an integral part of TN politics," says Sumathi.With almost 98% of the state being non-vegetarian, the easy-going and hearty biryani is the perfect way to cement a bond.When food vlogger Irfan (of the popular social media handle Irfan’sView) got started three years ago, among the first videos he put up was of him relishing a plate of Dindigul style biryani. Almost instantly, it got him 1.6 million views and helped his digital trajectory get off to an explosive start."When my vlogging was taking off, I would do biryani episodes at least once every two weeks because I found they got the most views," says Irfan, a 27-year-old BPO employee-turned-popular vlogger. "Biryani is a universal dish but can be customized to local tastes. I realised viewers are on the lookout for what’s new on the biryani scene."Biryani is a versatile meal, says Krish Ashok, author of ‘Masala Lab: The Science of Indian Cooking’. "It can be minimalist or extravagant, depending on the ingredients. It can be made sinfully expensive with ingredients like rose water, dry fruits and saffron, or cheap by using lower quality rice and cuts of meat. But whichever way you cook it, biryani brings with it the aroma and aura of a feast," he says.Though it traces its origins to Persia and is believed to have been brought to India by the Mughals, today, every part of the country has its own signature version, says Krish. "For instance, the Malabar style incorporates pineapple, while the Bengalis add potato."Within TN too, the flavours are hyperlocal, says Irfan. "The Madurai style uses the more meaty seeraga samba rice, while in Chennai it’s predominantly the lighter basmati rice that is used. Just the type of rice can change the taste."Though biryani merely combines the most widely eaten staple rice with meat, it is truly a canvas that adapts itself across class and situation, says Krish. "It’s perfect for people in a rush, for those who have all the time in the world, for the poor and the rich. It’s infinitely variable," he says. Which is why, election season or not, it’s always got the vote of the masses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/biryani-the-hit-for-all-seasons/articleshow/81609033.cms||---

Vijayan had commented that Kanam's statement criticizing the NSS on the Sabarimala issue that is awaiting a court verdict was not provocative. NSS general secretary G Sukumaran Nair said that with his statement the CM had indirectly criticized the stand taken by the NSS on the matter. He alleged that the state government has not taken any stand in favour of the devotees yet. "Devaswom minister Kadakampally Surendran apologised for the Sabarimala events in the wake of the elections. CPM general secretary corrected Kadakampally and said that the LDF government will continue its earlier stand. After this, the chief minister came up saying that if the devotees have any difficulty with the final court verdict a decision will be made only after holding talks with all. Then comes Kanam in support of the LDF government finding fault with the NSS that has stood for the protection of the rights of devotees from the beginning," Nair said. "Now the chief minister is saying Kanam had not said anything provocative. If the leaders had a clear and true stand regarding the protection of the faith of devotees, there would not have been any confusion among them. This is the very reason for the lack of confidence of the devotees in these leaders." Nair also confirmed that it was the members of the NSS who took out the 'namajapa' procession to the secretariat the other day to protest Kanam's statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/nss-hits-out-at-cm-for-backing-kanams-remark/articleshow/81609047.cms||Jaikrishnan Nair

The total is slightly less than Friday's tally of 30,600. Sites in PMC limits recorded the highest vaccination total for the day, with 18,790 beneficiaries. The PCMC centres followed with 5894 beneficiaries and the rural parts recorded 4166 beneficiaries. Also on Saturday, more than 12,000 senior citizens and nearly 4,000 people with comorbidities received their shots in the region across 201 sites (97 in PMC limits, 56 in rural areas and 48 in the PCMC). Authorities said the drive was largely stable with centres recording no technical glitches. Officials from the PMC said they are now trying to expand coverage. “Some more private hospital sites will join the vaccine drive soon. These new sites can take daily vaccination numbers in the city to above 20,000," a senior official with the PMC said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/region-records-over-28000-beneficiaries/articleshow/81609045.cms||Sarang Dastane
---||Vadodara||Vadodara city BJP unit under tight grip of Covid-19||VADODARA: The city unit of the Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) seems to be under the tight grip of Covid-19 with members of the party right from corporators to Vadodara MP testing positive. The members have been involved in a series of public events in the recent past. Be it folk and devotional music concerts ahead of Shivratri, a steady trickle of visitors to congratulate those who won in the civic polls and got picked up for key posts or Shivji Ki Savari; BJP members were consistently seen amidst a large number of people. For photo ops and even otherwise, many were seen without masks too. Letting the guard down now seems to be catching up with party members. The elected members from the party who have tested positive in a week include five corporators, BJP’s Dabhoi MLA Shailesh Mehta, who resides in the city and Vadodara MP Ranjan Bhatt. Former corporator Shankuntala Shinde died after she tested positive for the coronavirus. Others include former Vadodara mayor Shabdasharan Brahmbhatt and former corporator Harshit Talati. Family members of a BJP corporator too have tested positive even as another corporator tested positive and negative in tests at different times. BJP city unit president Dr Vijay Shah said that party members were at risk as they were public figures and attended public gatherings. He added that the party had banned all public gatherings. “Party members can focus on work related to vaccination and other aspects of Covid-19. The mayor has also stated that the visits for congratulating him should be stopped,” Shah added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/vadodara-city-bjp-unit-under-tight-grip-of-covid-19/articleshow/81609043.cms||---

---||Dehradun||International Day of Forests: Communities which live near forests and are supposed to protect them, have steadily lost footing over the years||Dehradun: Lack of involvement of communities living in and around forests, coupled with inadequate resources at their disposal, is what is putting India’s forests at risk, believe experts. Uttarakhand is home to the country’s oldest forest management system, van panchayats (VPs), but only about half of the state’s 11,522 VPs are currently functional. Formed in 1931 under the Indian Forest Act 1927, van panchayats give villagers the power to do what is needed to protect forests. However, the power has successively been curtailed with amendments to the Act in 1976, 2001, 2005 & 2012. It is no different in other forest-rich states like Madhya Pradesh, which has more than 15,228 joint forest management committees (JMPs) and eco-development committees, Maharashtra (which has 12,665 JMPs) and Odisha (which has 12,494 JMPs). Experts say decisions in JMPs are usually taken by forest officials as result of which, role of villagers has become marginalised. India’s forest cover is spread across 21.67% geographic area of the country, which is around 7,12,249 sq km. There are 188 different types of forests in the country. For authorities, the task is to protect these forests from threats of wildfires, climate change, deforestation, encroachment, as well as monitoring the change of land use (which facilitates use of forest land for non-forestry purposes). Padma Shri recipient Jadav Molai Payeng, who received India’s highest civilian honour for turning a 1,400 strip of sandy land along the Brahmaputra in Assam into a dense forest and is known as the ‘Forest Man of India’, said, “There is an urgent need to involve everyone in saving the planet by planting more trees. Our country should start by making good use of the traditional wisdom of forest communities. Involving forest communities in management of forests is just on papers, which shouldn’t be the case.” In a similar vein, Nitin Rai of Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE) Bangalore, added, “Tribals are an integral part of forest management as their way of living involves cultivating forests. Data of almost 150 years collected by Biligiri Rangaswamy Temple (BRT) Tiger Reserve shows that having tribals tend to a forest they are familiar with has great ecological benefits. Valuable species multiply while weeds are kept under control. Unfortunately, since the inception of Indian Forest Act, the focus is on removing these tribes from forests and robbing them of their basic rights.” Citing an example, Rai said, “In BRT as well as Corbett Tiger Reserve, invasive species like Lantana, Kamila, Cramlina and Equatorium have grown all over the forests. This is due to lack of participation of local communities.” Forest authorities of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha and Uttarakhand said that they are working to involve local residents to protect the forests they grew up with. While this arrangement is beneficial for both authorities and local communities, scientists feel these communities need to be trained in technical know-how in dealing with the risks a forest faces.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/international-day-of-forests-communities-which-live-near-forests-and-are-supposed-to-protect-them-have-steadily-lost-footing-over-the-years/articleshow/81608579.cms||Shivani Azad

Sitharaman was the chief guest at Nirma University’s 29th convocation on Saturday where she was present virtually. “We Indians have a knack of finding new opportunities even in challenging times. The spirit of Indian entrepreneur finds that energy, that positivity to survive and prosper. I appeal to the students getting degree today to make it a greater quest,” said the minister in her speech. The FM pointed at sectors like space and atomic energy, earlier reserved completely by the government, but which opened up recently. She added that the students should not worry about approval from all. “You should understand your desire, your drive and work in that direction,” she said. In the ceremony, 52 PhD, 798 PG and 1,530 graduate degrees were awarded. Graduating students included 1,557 male and 823 female students. The university presented 59 medals to 30 female and 21 male students for academic excellence.

---||Chennai||Govt closes classes IX to XI as Covid-19 rears its head again in Tamil Nadu||CHENNAI: Following the rise in Covid-19 cases across Tamil Nadu and schools emerging as new hotspots, the state government on Saturday ordered closure of schools for Classes IX, X and XI from March 22 till further notice. Physical classes for Class XII students, however, will continue as they have to appear for board exams. While fresh cases in the state crossed the 1,000-mark for the first time in 81 days on Friday, 1,243 new cases were recorded on Saturday. As on Saturday, at least 143 students of 14 schools in Thanjavur district had tested positive. One teacher, two drivers and a few parents, too, had tested positive for Covid-19 over the past week. One teacher had tested positive in Trichy district. “The director of public health and preventive medicine has informed that Covid-19 cases were detected in schools in Thanjavur district. In a few other districts, too, Covid cases were being detected. Though the number of cases are few, it could spread fast to people in their respective areas through Covid school clusters. To prevent the spread, he had recommended to cancel permission given to schools to conduct physical classes from IX to XI,” said chief secretary Rajeev Ranjan in a statement. Further the statement said the director also suggested that schools may be allowed to conduct classes for Class XII students as their number will be relatively low and they may have to face board exams. Classes and hostels for these students can also be allowed to function by adhering to SOPs. The state government discussed these recommendations with the school education department, health and family welfare department and department of disaster management. “In view of the increasing Covid-19 cases, to avoid students and general public from getting affected, the orders were issued to close all schools for classes IX, X and XI and the hostels until further orders. However, online classes will continue for these students,” the chief secretary said. Rajeev Ranjan further said that the board exams for other board Class X students, including CBSE and ICSE will be held as announced. The schools are permitted to hold special classes for these students and operate hostels, he said. The chief secretary also urged the people to wear masks and follow social distancing and wash their hands regularly besides asking the eligible persons (60 and above and persons with comorbidities from 45 to 59) to get vaccinated in government and approved private health centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/govt-closes-classes-ix-to-xi-as-virus-rears-its-head-again-in-tn/articleshow/81609599.cms||---

Police said the battered body of the youth with a fatal injury on the head was recovered from a desolate spot. Police said during the investigation, it came to fore that Aadil was in a relationship with a married woman in the area. The woman’s father, brother and two of their accomplices had called Aadil for a booze party and then killed him, said police. Bulandshahr senior superintendent of police Santosh Kumar Singh said, “The accused took the victim to a desolate spot and attacked him with a stone on his head. Three accused, including the woman’s father and brother, have been arrested, while efforts are on to arrest the fourth accused.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/youth-bludgeoned-to-death-with-brick-over-illicit-relationship/articleshow/81608086.cms||---

Gopinath, a local Congress leader based in Manjeri, views every new manifesto as sacred and not just another addition to his shelf full of party manifestos he has amassed over the decades. This time, he shared his suggestions with UDF manifesto committee members, including MP Shashi Tharoor and Dr M K Muneer, when they visited Malappuram as part of the interaction programme to solicit suggestions from the public for drafting the manifesto. “I told the leaders that there are unfulfilled promises, and that those should be incorporated in the new manifesto. Overall, I feel that the new UDF manifesto is forward looking and has the right mix of plans for social welfare and development, including the NYAY scheme and plans for creation of world-class infrastructure,” he said. This time the attempt to solicit suggestions from the public to prepare the manifesto is a welcome one. It will transform the manifesto from a dull document into a dynamic and responsive one, he added. “For the last many years, Congress workers in the state don’t have much connect with manifestos. The printed copies of the party manifesto of 2019 parliamentary elections were not even available at KPCC office and I got one after contacting AICC general secretary K C Venugopal,” Gopinath said. Though manifesto soft copies are readily available, that won’t serve the purpose in a country like India with a pronounced digital divide, he added. Gopinath’s love affair with manifestos started at the age of 16 when he started collecting manifestos to prepare speeches during election campaigns as a Congress worker. “In those times, party manifestos were the only source of information to know what the parties would deliver if voted to power. We used to carefully study the document and made it a point to devote a major portion of our campaign speeches on that. But now, controversies like KIIFB, Life Mission, gold smuggling, etc, have become main campaign points. I don’t think that that is the proper way to campaign,” he said. Gopinath continues his habit of collecting and tracking manifestos and has over 100 manifestos, including that of Left parties and BJP, apart from all the manifestos of Congress.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/kerala/congs-manifesto-man-gives-a-thumbs-up-to-udf/articleshow/81609055.cms||---
---||Chennai||Sex-ed classroom now goes online||Chennai: While growing up R Keerthana, like most other girls, battled unending questions about her sexual health but had no safe space to voice them or get them addressed. Because, inside the house, they were always taboo.It was much later in life that Keerthana, now a 35-year-old content developer from Chennai, found her answers on the Instagram page — Dr Cuterus — run by Dr Tanaya Narendra, an Allahabad-based social media influencer who studied assisted reproductive technologies at Oxford, and has been running the account with more than 2.38 lakh followers for two years.In many ways, the role that ‘sexpert’ columns in newspapers played in busting myths and destigmatising sexual wellness, could have been taken over by a growing virtual space created by new-age gynaecologists and reproductive health experts, who are using the reach of social media to not just answer queries, but impart what they called ‘sex-positive’ education. They use short, catchy videos, illustrations, GIFs, props and even incorporate fairy tales in delineating scientific explanations of sexual and reproductive health."The uterus is often looked at through a lens of shame. However, I find it beautiful as it is where life begins. Hence, the name ‘Dr Cuterus’ for my page," says Dr Narendra. "Gaining reliable, expert-backed knowledge is important in breaking the chain of sex-negativity. And social media — with the kind of access it has among young people — can be the educator in doing this," she says.Keerthana says for years she was looking for reliable experts to clear doubts on issues, such as pigmentation, or about the use of sexual hygiene products, but found little luck. "Some of the gynaecologists I visited took the moral high ground and this dissuaded me from asking questions," she says. One can get simple doubts cleared, such as the colour of menstrual blood or misconceptions around masturbation, while having their identity protected. What Abinay Swaminathan, a 28-year-old, finds reassuring about these platforms is that they address questions related to male sexual health and self-esteem that one may find difficult to find answers to elsewhere. "Ideal, impractical standards of beauty and attraction are set for men too, and many times, it is through these pages that one understands that real bodies aren’t like what you see in popular media," he says. This is in fact among the crucial things virtual sexperts are trying to fight. "Our bodies are diverse. The idea that the vulva should be a certain colour, or the penis, a certain size, are all notions we need to break," says Dr Narendra.However, straight, no-nonsense sex talk comes with a price and experts like her have often faced restrictions on these platforms. But they continue to "state facts as doctors," says the 27-year-old, whose viral hashtag #ScrewTheShush — featuring gender-neutral videos on the subject went viral. "Once, my IG live was disabled midway. An AI blocked me as it ‘violated their rules’," she says. "But I have learned to live with that unpredictability".For city-based gynaecologist Dr Surakshith Battina, Instagram has become the space to create awareness about medical procedures. "Most of the questions I receive are about the fastest ways to conceive and pain during intercourse," he says. The 34-year-old consultant at Indigo Women’s Centre, Anna Nagar, who talks about intimate wellness, believes organic learning is essential to normalising the subject. He will soon be uploading videos on ectopic pregnancy. According to Dr Shweta Suryaraj, a gynaecologist who visits her patients offline, social media platforms could offer a comfortable atmosphere to learn about sexual well-being. "I have seen my patients hesitate to raise these questions, but these platforms could change that," she says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/sex-ed-classroom-now-goes-online/articleshow/81609053.cms||Harshitha Kumayaa

In an attempt to increase the vaccination numbers further, the BMC appealed to people who were eligible to take the shots to turn up at any of the 97 vaccine centres in the city, including 59 in the private sector “without waiting for the date of scheduled appointment”. The BMC move means the elderly and those above the age of 45 who have co-morbidities will be able to walk in and ask to be vaccinated. “We plan to add 20 more private centres and take the daily vaccination numbers to 75,000 in the coming week,” said municipal additional commissioner Suresh Kakani. A week thereafter, the plan is to reach a lakh recipients a day, as municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal announced on Friday. The BMC will also take vaccination closer to the community, starting with Dharavi on Monday. The vaccination centre at Dharavi urban health centre, popularly called the Chhota Sion Hospital, will start functioning from 9am, said Kiran Dighavkar, assistant municipal commissioner, G-North ward. Appeals have been made throughout Dharavi about the neighbourhood vaccination centre. Kakani said the BMC has also met several NGOs to motivate slum-dwellers to get vaccinated. BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare said that each of the participating private hospital has been told to increase the number of recipients to 1,000 a day. “Many of the big hospitals have huge auditoriums that can be used for vaccination purposes,” she said. On Saturday, 59 private sector hospitals vaccinated 16,791 people. With Saturday’s nearly 50,000 turnout, the BMC has managed to give the first Covid vaccine shot to 7.4 lakh, or about a third of the 23 lakh priority population, comprising healthcare and frontline workers and the elderly and those over 45 years with comorbidities. Across the state, over 35 lakh of the priority population has taken the first dose so far. State officials have often said the priority population is roughly three crore. The state managed to vaccinate 2,56,191 people on Friday (the state vaccination data, unlike the BMC data, is shared a day later). Of these 1,42,809 were senior citizens. State immunisation officer Dr Dilip Patil said the state will soon cross the three lakh doses mark. “Our motive is to increase the daily 'vaccination to three lakh a day by involving our primary health centres, sub-centres and, maybe, even the wellness centres,” said Dr Patil. He said the state has vaccine stock for eight to nine days. “We expect fresh stock early next week,” he said. In Vasai-Virar, the municipal corporation there shut a vaccination centre in Varun Industries, Valiv, and instead reopened a 1000-bed Covid care centre in response to the rising number of cases.

They work hand in hand outside the state,” said Lekhi. “Both are corrupt and the two sides of the same coin. CPM and Congress have the same policy on Sabarimala. During the struggle against women’s entry in Sabarimala, Congress only tried to create an impression that it was against the government. If not so, why no case was registered against any Congress workers in connection with the Sabarimala protest?” she said. Lekhi accused chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan of being partial toward Christians and other minorities. “For Pinarayi Vijayan, minority means Muslims only. That’s why only Muslims are included in the minority commission,” she said. Lekhi blasted M Swaraj, MLA, on account of his controversial statements regarding Sabarimala. Lekhi added that those who put people in jail for performing rooster sacrifices protect others who kill animals in tune with their religious beliefs. She claimed that the UDF and LDF governments in Kerala divide people on communal lines. Thiruvananthapuram: BJP has condemned the attack on Anoop Antony, the NDA candidate in Ambalappuzha constituency. BJP state general secretary George Kurian on Saturday alleged that the CPM cadres were behind the attack as they were allegedly piqued by the growing popularity of the BJP.Kurian demanded strict police action against those who attacked Antony during his election campaign. He was attacked hours after Sandeep Vachaspathi, the BJP candidate in Alappuzha, along with his party men offered floral tributes to the martyrs of Punnapra-Vayalar struggle by claiming that the workers killed in the police firing were misled by the fake assurances of communist leaders. That’s why no leaders were killed in the firing, he claimed. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/nda-in-kerala-is-fighting-ludf-meenakshi-lekhi/articleshow/81609057.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Rajkot||Income tax collection in Gujarat falls 4.3%||Rajkot: The income tax collection from Gujarat, the fourth biggest contributor to India’s direct tax revenues, was down 4.3% in the current financial year as compared to an average 20% growth every year, the obvious reason being the Covid-19 pandemic that hit salaries as well as business class alike. The major contributor to the drag down was Vadodara which saw a fall of 80% in tax collection. Experts say that the tumble is due to the high number of salaried people in Vadodara, reduced rate of tax deducted at source (TDS), job cuts and salary cuts. According to sources, Gujarat’s collection target was Rs 65,000 crore in the beginning of FY 2020-21 but was revised to Rs 43,000 crore looking at the actual collection figures. Sources in the central agency said the finance ministry had asked officials to remain liberal in dealing with the assessee. “We have been told not to ask anybody to pay appropriate tax, even if we are aware about some evaders. We have powers to open the account next year and the evaders will be made to pay,” a senior IT officer told TOI, requesting anonymity. According to tax and industry experts, the key reasons for the fall in collection is the total lockdown in the first quarter when the income tax department only received TDS, that too from salaries paid by the employer and interest paid by the banks. The job loss, the pay cuts and reduction of overall GDP is reflected in the income tax figures. The TDS collection, however, grew 28% compared to last year. The last installment of advance tax was to be paid by March 15, 2021. Parth Ganatra, vice-president, Rajkot Chamber of Commerce and Industry (RCCI) said, “Industry revenue was drastically low in the first quarter of the fiscal and there were only expenses, which is reflected in the overall tax collection target.” Jainik Vakil, a chartered accountant added, “This tax collection figures shows that even during pandemic Gujarat’s industries did well. The figure shows that by March 31, the collection would be the same as last year, which indicates that despite the GDP dropping, the income tax in Gujarat is the same as it was last year.” Every October, the income tax department starts planning and conducting surveys and approaches big taxpayers to see that they pay third and fourth installments of advance tax as per the ‘expectations’ of the department. However this financial year, this exercise was not done and officials did not ‘pressurise’ assessees, top department officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/income-tax-collection-in-gujarat-falls-4-3/articleshow/81605223.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

---||Kochi||‘Political scene in Kalamassery conducive to an LDF win’||CPM has high hopes in Kalamassery this time. The party has fielded the strongest possible candidate, expecting to take advantage of issues in the rival front like the graft case against the sitting MLA and the strong dissent among IUML workers and leaders against their own candidate. LDF candidate P Rajeev speaks to TOI about the front’s poll prospects in Kalamassery. LDF’s main campaign topic is the importance of ensuring its continuity in rule. Why is it important? Congress cannot stop BJP’s growth in Kerala. Only LDF takes a strong stand against communal forces. Congress and BJP work alike in Kerala and the people, especially minorities, believe that only LDF could resolve their insecurities. There is no anti-incumbency; instead pro-incumbency prevails for the first time in Kerala’s history. The main issue LDF faced earlier was its lack of focus in ensuring basic infrastructure. But the Pinarayi government ensured a balanced approach towards infrastructure development and people’s welfare. Your take on LDF-BJP camaraderie allegations. Those are baseless allegations and the truth about the real camaraderie was revealed by senior BJP leader O Rajagopal a few days ago. Only Congress and BJP have understandings with each other. How do you look at BJP’s growth in Kerala? BJP was disappointed with the LSG and Lok Sabha poll results. In the last assembly polls, they somehow got one seat. The political scenario in Nemom is favourable to LDF. It is not easy to communalise Kerala society using Hindutva card.  Congress in Kerala earlier had a Leftist nature and its leaders and workers used to join LDF and not BJP. But now, there is a tendency of migration to BJP, which is dangerous. Sabarimala issue resurfaced as a key election topic. Sabarimala issue is a closed chapter. CPM has made its stand very clear. The review petition is under SC’s consideration and whatever the order is, it will be implemented only after discussions with concerned people. Kalamassery is a strong UDF bastion. What are the LDF campaign highlights?  The political scenario in Kalamassery is conducive to an LDF win as people don’t want a corruption-ridden UDF rule again. The LSG polls results too are promising and we are confident of breaking the UDF bastion. We propose a comprehensive development of the constituency with equal importance to agriculture, industry, service sector, etc. Ernakulam medical college will be upgraded to international standards and the cancer centre construction will be completed in a time-bound manner. The constituency is a higher-education hub with many public and private institutions and the focus will be on improving their standard. Poster campaign against you in Kalamassery alleged that you tried to protect former CPM area committee secretary Zakir Hussain, who was ousted from the party. Those allegations were an attempt by political enemies to disrupt the LDF campaign. CPM will not protect any member, irrespective of their position, if found guilty. It happened in Zakir’s case too. How do you look at the growth of Twenty20 in Ernakulam? Politics is different in LSG and assembly polls. I can’t say about Kunnathunad but Twenty20 won’t create any effect in other constituencies. In fact, Twenty20’s presence in Kunnathunad, a sitting seat of UDF, might help LDF.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/political-scene-in-kalamassery-conducive-to-an-ldf-win/articleshow/81609076.cms||Anantha Narayanan K
---||Ahmedabad||Agri-tech startup to raise Rs 5cr for expansion||Ahmedabad: Ahmedabad-based Agri-tech startup, Rise Hydroponics, is looking to raise a sum of Rs 5 crore by the first quarter of 2021-22. Presently incubated at Entrepreneurship Development Institute of India (EDII), the startup enables people to set-up soil-less farms that are commercially scalable. So far, it has set up some 15 commercial soil-less farms for cultivating vegetables across some seven Indian states, namely Gujarat, Maharashtra, Delhi, UP, Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand and Haryana, since its inception in April 2020. “Several investors have approached us for funding and we expect to raise a sum of Rs 5 crore by the first quarter,” said Meet Patel, founder, Rise Hydroponics. “At present, we have a total of 2 lakh sq ft cultivable area under soil-less agriculture across 15 commercial farms, with a capacity of 5,000 plants and an estimated yield of 1,000 tonnes in a year. With the fresh round of funding, we plan to operationalize and scale up our own commercial farms, which we’re setting up. That apart, we plan to geographically expand our business too,” said Patel. By providing equipment and technology to undertake soil-less farming, the startup has largely worked with urban farmers and it also has a retail business under the brand, Rise Fresh, as part of which they retail residue-free and pesticide-free vegetable produce. Meet along with his two partners, Tushar Aggarwal and Vivek Shukla ran an advisory firm for companies to adopt and promote hydroponic technology, but it was just at the cusp of the pandemic when they launched Rise Hydroponics. “By March 2021, we aim to clock a revenue of Rs 5 crore,” said Patel. Commercial farms set up by Rise Hydroponics yield pesticide-free produce with protected cultivation, with each farm operating on an IOT-enabled technology that aids in temperature and humidity control. “Since we work on a turnkey project basis with some of our clients, we are able to locally source and retail the produce from their farms. We have a sound retail channel in Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Rajkot, and Mumbai and by December 2021, we aim at expansion in 10-12 major cities of India, through the funding,” said Patel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/agri-tech-startup-to-raise-rs-5cr-for-expansion/articleshow/81609067.cms||Niyati Parikh

---||Nagpur||Dr VN Thatte, a science genius who worked wonders with just one eye||Our late grandfather, Dr Vishwanath Narayan Thatte, was a radiant personality. He passed away a few decades ago, but his teachings and values remain fresh in our memory. A genius driven by ageless intelligence, he not only inspired his progeny, but also moulded the careers of many scientists, who went on to impart that knowledge to thousands of students. Born on March 21, 1896, in Amravati, his family had moved there from Konkan. His father, Narayan, was a highly respected school inspector, while his mother, Laxmibai was a homemaker. Young Thatte inherited the legacy of intelligence and discipline from his parents. After completing his matriculation with distinction from Akola, Thatte came to Nagpur for further education. He joined Hislop College and completed his inter-science with physics, chemistry and biology. He initially wanted to be a doctor, but sometime during his college education, it was physics that caught his eye. He went on to study physics, chemistry and mathematics for his bachelor’s degree (B.Sc.), thus declining admission to all forthcoming opportunities in medicine. A master’s in physics was soon to follow. He pursued both his degrees from the then prestigious Allahabad University, needless to say, in flying colours. His innate desire to teach brought him to the Victoria College of Science (now Institute of Science) at Nagpur, where he joined as a demonstrator. After that, there was no looking back. In 1925, he was transferred to King Edward College, Amravati. Two years down the line, he got selected to be a research fellow at London University. He did his research under Prof. Gills in “Temperature Variation of Isoelectric Oscillations of Crystal Quartz.” However, he had a disagreement with his guide and decided to finish his research and return to India in 1930. Victoria College welcomed him with open arms, where his teaching job and research work soared. His research papers earned him a D.Sc. (post-doctoral degree), the first from Nagpur University. In 1939, he was appointed head of the physics department, a post he held till his retirement in 1954. In 1951 he was elected dean of the faculty of science. Being a popular and dedicated professor, he was appointed on the board of several societies, including academic council and executive council. He was extremely popular among his students. His strict demeanour was hardly an obstacle because he delved deep into each topic he taught until he ensured that every student was well-versed with it. He was a man of practical experimentation. He would regularly conduct physics experiments for his students. He was involved at every stage, right from setting up the apparatus, from scrap if necessary, to arriving at conclusions. A teacher’s job is considered done not at the end of a classroom lesson, but at the peak of his students’ careers. That is how he is deemed worthy as a teacher; most of his students rose to great heights. They remember him to this day as a devoted teacher who helped shape their lives. This zealous teacher was always thirsty for knowledge even after retirement. Now that he had more time at hand, he dove deeper into intriguing topics of physics. He even set up a laboratory in his car garage, from scrap like broken mirrors, empty oil and soap tins. He was not only a master of science, but also an empathetic human being. He understood that in order to bring science to the common people, it’s language had to be vernacular. That is how he wrote books on physics in Marathi and Hindi, even in simplified English. These books are referred to by students and teachers till date. He also executed his idea of a Marathi Vidnyan Parishad (Marathi Society of Science) with his peers, and was the president and founding member of the same. He put in a lot of effort to popularise the work of this organization. Astronomy was another branch of physics which piqued his interest. He spent several nights gazing and documenting celestial bodies. He even photographed a lunar eclipse, with only an old box camera purchased in London. His endless achievements also boast of him being president of the Indian Physics Association, Nagpur chapter in 1972 and 1973. In 1974, when the Science Congress was held in Nagpur and a science exhibition was set up, he thought of having a permanent space for exhibiting science experiments in Nagpur. It was this idea that gave rise to the Raman Museum of Science and Technology, popularly known as the Raman Science Centre. He was appointed honorary curator for the first two years, and worked hard to build the then new establishment for the benefit of young and curious minds for years to come. As a student, he received a number of awards, of which the Maccay silver medal, the Hardinge gold medal and the Balwantrao book prize are of notable importance. He also published a total of sixteen research papers in different Indian and international science magazines like the Indian Journal of Physics, Philosophical Magazine, Zeitschrift fur Physik and Journal of Scientific Instruments, to name a few. For his service in the field of science, the Marathi Vidnyan Parishad felicitated him with a momento. The Nagpur Municipal Corporation also honoured him with the title of Vidnyan Maharshi in the corporation’s silver jubilee year in 1977. Science was not the only field of academia that held his attention. He was also interested in literature, having strong command over Marathi, Hindi, Urdu, Sanskrit and English. The works of William Wordsworth, PB Shelley, Shakespeare, Mirza Ghalib, Sant Tukaram, Kabirdas are amongst the numerous pieces that he knew by heart. He was one of the few, if not the only science student to procure the highest marks in English literature in university exams. While serving as a lecturer at King Edward College of Science, Amravati, he established the Marathi Sahitya Sangha, which stands supposedly as the only example of a science teacher setting up a literary platform. He was also passionate about sports, excelling in tennis, cricket and badminton. He was an enthusiastic walker and cyclist, travelling miles around the city. Moreover, he was an accomplished swimmer. He was so involved in sports that he lost his left eye to a cricket ball injury in his childhood. This incident evidently did not stop him from becoming the great genius that we all love and respect. He went on to lead a successful and accomplished life, seeing the world with only his right eye. At home, he was blessed with a devoted and caring wife, Maltibai, who ably shouldered domestic responsibilities, giving him enough time to pursue his love for science and teaching. Yet, he was always involved in domestic chores, and she was no less of a prodigy of wit, humour and smartness herself; a well-balanced marriage, one would say! They both passed on their intellect to their children, who excelled in their own careers and personal lives. On his eighty-first birthday, his students commemorated the joyous occasion by establishing the Dr VN Thatte Science Foundation to increase the reach of science education. This was a fitting tribute by his students who dearly loved and ardently respected him. His seemingly and most deservingly perpetual path of work in science was halted only by his illness towards the end of 1983. He took his last breath on March 26, 1985. Today, March 21, 2021, marks his 125th birth anniversary. On behalf of all his children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren, I , his grandson, pay this homage to him. My grandfather is not only a legacy, but a timeless memory etched in our hearts, and his monumental treasury of work makes him live forever.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/dr-vn-thatte-a-science-genius-who-worked-wonders-with-just-one-eye/articleshow/81609064.cms||---
---||Kochi||Eradicating extreme poverty a thrust area of LDF manifesto: CM||Thrissur: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Saturday said eradicating absolute poverty in Kerala is a thrust area of the LDF manifesto for this assembly elections. While talking to the reporters at Cheruthuruthy, the CM also attacked the reported encroachment of the BJP candidate at Punnapra-Vayalar martyrs memorial saying it was part of a design to sabotage the peaceful election campaign in the state. “Punnapra-Vayalar martyrs’ memorial has deep emotional connect with the Communist party workers in Kerala. Any encroachment there would have attracted retaliatory actions from the party workers. I complement the people there for not getting provoked after the incident. But the encroachment by the BJP candidate is a highly condemnable and provocative act,” Vijayan said. The chief minister said a survey will be conducted to identify the people who are facing abject poverty in the state. Rough estimates indicate that 45 lakh families in the state are facing abject poverty. “They may be facing diverse problems, the plight of some can change by giving employment to at least one member of the family. The support of the local bodies, cooperative societies, private sector as well as government institutions will be pooled to provide employment to them. There could be others who would require direct financial support to come out of the shackles of poverty. They may require Rs 1 lakh to Rs 15 lakh to survive. Schemes will be evolved to provide financial support to them. Micro-level planning will be carried out to form programmes to suited to each sections,” the CM said. The LDF would give special attention to the sectors like dairy and poultry where self-sufficiency can be achieved by the state. Steps would be taken to augment the income of the farmers by introducing more value-added products in these sectors, he said. He added that the LDF will ensure that none of the deserving sections is the state is excluded from the concern and programmes of the government.  Asked about the reported statement of the NSS leaders that CPI secretary Kanam Rajendran was making provocative statements on the Sabarimala issue, the chief minister said Rajendran has not made any provocative statements. Tension at CM’s meeting Tension prevailed at the LDF election campaign meeting which was addressed by the chief minister after a man stepped on to the stage and pushed down CPM state secretariat member Baby John, while he was speaking. The incident occurred after the CM left the stage. The accused has been identified as Shukoor from Chenthrappinni . Police took him into custody and registered a case after slapping charges like attempt to murder.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/eradicating-extreme-poverty-a-thrust-area-of-ldf-manifesto-cm/articleshow/81609062.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

They officials found that majority of the patients did not have any noticeable symptoms including gastrointestinal illness, skin rashes and fever and were not even unwell too, leading them to continue moving around normally thus spreading the virus faster in the city. Some of the patients of the new strain even did not have symptoms of coughing or headache. The presence of UK and South African strain was confirmed in the city during recent tests. “The virus is damaging the lungs of the majority of patients without the person even knowing that he is infected. These patients are moving around freely and infecting others as well,” city municipal commissioner Banchhanidhi Pani told TOI. “Lung involvement is hidden till the patients turn serious. Due to this, such patients arrive at the hospital with serious infection already in the lungs. A person does not feel the severity at the initial stage,” Pani added. Further, the health authorities are also having to battle with asymptomatic cases as well as rapid test results are also proving false for such patients. “Couple of my rapid tests turned out negative. But due to a prolonged fever of around six days, I went to the hospital and after detailed examination, docs found infection in the lungs,” said a resident of City Light. According to health officials, the situation is worsening since people are not wearing masks. “The newly found strains are highly contagious but may not be harmful as much for all patients. Due to this, the rise in the number of cases is sharp,” said an SMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/virus-damages-patients-lungs-without-symptoms/articleshow/81609071.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

Civil society must come forward to save this bird which a few decades ago thrived in the old gardens, houses and trees around them. Now, with replacement of concrete, a conscious effort is needed to create an atmosphere for these birds to revive.” Elaborating upon the reasons for their depletion in numbers, Asad Rahmani, former director of the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) and senior scientific advisor at the Corbett Foundation, said, “The decline is mainly because we have changed our house design and structures in the last four to five decades. Heavy use of pesticides has killed the soft bodied insects which baby sparrows are fed by parents. The adults feed on grains and seeds but the growing chicks need a protein diet to grow muscles and feathers. No one knows how many chicks starve to death or die of malnutrition due to lack of proper food." The event was organised under the aegis of Haritma, an NGO working in the field of environment. “Foxtail millet or ‘kangni’, kodo millet or sama are the staple died of sparrows. If these plants are sown in the garden, sparrows will start returning but at the same time one should not remove grass from the garden as it promotes insect population which is good for baby sparrows. Some shrubs with thorns should also be planted as being small in size, sparrows can easily save themselves and their eggs from predatory birds and cats,” said ornithologist Rajat Bhargava, while explaining the methodology to attract sparrows back into houses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/forest-dept-civil-society-join-hands-to-bring-back-sparrows/articleshow/81608121.cms||Sandeep Rai

Hospitals not providing Covid-19 treatment so far have been asked to get themselves empanelled as Covid-19 hospitals by March 25.The officer on special duty for Covid-19 in the city and district Vinod Rao issued a notification for the hospitals on Saturday. Apart from the sharp rise in the number of hospitalisations, the notification aims to ensure that cross-infection of Covid-19 does not take place in hospitals.After the first wave and the spike after Diwali festivities, the lowest hospitalisation in the city was seen on February 13 when 515 patients were admitted in the city. The number rose drastically since then and reached 2,780 on Saturday.The hospitals have been asked to postpone scheduled elective surgeries till April 10 except in unavoidable cases. This shall become implementable from Monday.The notification also asked hospitals to ensure that patients who are eligible for home-based Covid care are not admitted to hospitals needlessly. The hospitals have been asked to advise such patients to go in for care at home from a designated private hospital or from the nearest urban health centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/hospitals-told-to-postpone-planned-surgeries-increase-covid-19-beds/articleshow/81609081.cms||---
---||Delhi||Salary dues: North Delhi Municipal Corporation doctors to go on strike from Monday||NEW DELHI: After observing mass leave on Friday, resident doctors of North Delhi Municipal Corporation-run dispensaries/polyclinics and Hindu Rao Hospital are planning to go ahead with an indefinite strike from Monday to highlight the issue of non-payment of salaries on a timely basis. Recently, doctors from Kasturba Hospital — another facility run by cash-strapped north corporation — withdrew from their strike call. After a strike in October over non-payment of salaries for several months, the doctors said that they were promised regular salaries. However, salary arrears are once again pending for three-four months. Dr Abhimanyu Sardana, who heads the Hindu Rao Residents Doctors’ Association, said that all residents were on mass leave on Friday and only emergency services were running. “We still haven’t received any word from the administration or any notice regarding payment of our salaries,” he said. “We had a meeting with Municipal Corporation Doctors’ association on Friday and as of now, we are progressing with a strike from Monday,” he added. North corporation mayor Jai Prakash appealed to doctors to not go on the strike, assuring the release of a month’s salary. “Yesterday, the doctors all took a mass leave simultaneously. We all need to cooperate and make sure that the patients coming to our hospitals do not suffer,” he added. The mayor said that a month’s salary had been credited to the accounts of doctors last week and in coming days, another month’s worth will be issued despite the severe financial crunch being faced by the civic body. “It is our duty to worry about the inconvenience faced by the patients,” Prakash said. The Hindu Rao RDA has written to additional commissioner (health), reminding them about commitments during the meeting held in October and pendency of salaries of over four months. “The residents are considering resigning or going for indefinite strike,” the letter states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/salary-dues-north-corpn-docs-to-go-on-strike-from-monday/articleshow/81609624.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Student-friendly measures for SSC, HSC: Home centres & extra time||NAGPUR: Students, parents and academics across Maharashtra welcomed school education minister Varsha Gaikwad’s decision to allow ‘home centres’ for SSC and HSC students. Gaikwad on Saturday unveiled a series of student-friendly initiatives for the upcoming board exams, which also included extra time and guarantee of a second chance in case the student fails to appear for the test. All these measures have been announced keeping in mind various difficulties being faced by students due to Covid-19 restrictions. The biggest sop was allowing students to appear for board exams at their own schools, rather than at randomly allotted centres in their area. TOI had reported in January that principals and students in Vidarbha have been demanding home centre policy. Ashnarayan Tiwari, principal of Adarsh Vidya Mandir (Gandhibagh), said, “It’s clearly one of the best decisions taken by the education minister. Having a home centre is extremely beneficial for students. When they go for their board exams, it will be the first offline exam they will appear for since January/February 2020. And this exam is one which will impact their academic future. So to make it mentally easier for them, it was really important to get a home centre.” Both SSC and HSC students will also be getting extra time to complete their exams. In a statement issued by Gaikwad’s office, it was mentioned that all exams which were scheduled for a three-hour duration will be extended to three-and-a-half hours. All exams which were scheduled for two hours, will be now be extended to 2 hours and 15 minutes. Also, students with disabilities will get 20 minutes extra per hour of their exam duration time. Keeping the Covid-19 situation in mind, minister Gaikwad announced that no student will miss exams due to Covid restrictions as a second chance will be given. The conditions mentioned by the minister include a student becoming Covid-19 positive or being unable to reach the exam centre due to restrictions by authorities (containment zone, total lockdown etc). Such students will get a chance in June. For this, the exam centre is likely to change but it will within their city only. Apart from this, the July-August exam for failure students will also continue as planned. Last year, Maharashtra government had slashed syllabi by 25% and today’s sops seem to have made the burden much more manageable. What’s new for SSC, HSC students Students will appear for exams in their own schools, no external centre to be allotted For the 80-marks theory paper, 30 extra minutes will be given, taking exam duration to 3.30 hours For the 40/50-marks theory paper, 15 extra minutes will be given, taking exam duration to 2.15 hours For students with disabilities, 20 extra minutes will be given per hour of exam duration SSC practical exams will now be ‘assignment’-based. To be conducted between May 21 and June 10 HSC (science) practical exams to be conducted as per routine protocol, between May 22 and June 10 HSC (science) to be conducted from a pool of 5-6 practical tests, not more HSC (arts and commerce) practicals to be conducted on ‘written assignment’ basis||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/student-friendly-measures-for-ssc-hsc-home-centres-extra-time/articleshow/81609086.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

All the district education officers have been directed to furnish the details by March 25. In a recently issued circular, the education department asked all the education officers to direct the school heads to update the complete data of the number of students studying in these classes. The list has to be updated based on streams and subjects. The exercise is being done to rationalise the deployment of Trained Graduate Teachers (TGTs) and Post Graduate Teachers (PGTs) to fill the vacancies in various posts across the state. “The schools will also have to furnish the proof of completing the exercise to their respective district education department,” reads the circular. The department has further warned the schools if the exercise is not carried out diligently leading to wrong or inadequate allotment of the teachers, the school administration will be held accountable for the same. The education department has claimed that the current exercise is being done to promote various TGT and PGTs and allot them schools on a need-basis. “The exercise is being carried out keeping the mandatory 1:30 ratio of teachers and students per subject. The exercise will also give an accurate estimate of the number of vacancies and where there are more teachers than required,” said an education department official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/edu-dept-seeks-student-details-to-rationalise-teacher-allotment/articleshow/81609653.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The banners have been put up by right-wing outfit Hindu Yuva Vahini whose members alleged that they plan to put up such banners in temples across Uttarakhand. The banners have been put up at temples situated in Chakrata Road, Suddhowala and Prem Nagar areas of Dehradun. The move comes days after a teenage boy from the Muslim community was assaulted for drinking tap water at the Dasna Devi temple in Dasna (Ghaziabad). The temple has a board that says that ‘Muslims are not allowed inside’ which has been put up on the directions of the temple’s head priest (mahant) Yati Narasimhanand Saraswati. Jeetu Randhawa, state general secretary of Hindu Yuva Vahini, when queried about the banners, alleged that the step has been taken to extend support to Yati Narasimhanand Saraswati. Incidentally, after the incident involving the teenage boy, BSP MLA from Dhaulana Aslam Chaudhary had alleged that the temple belonged to his ancestors, adding that he will remove the posters banning the entry of non-Hindus into the temple. Randhawa alleged that “in order to counter Aslam’s threat, we will now put up such posters outside every temple in Uttarakhand.” “The temple is a revered place for people who believe in the Sanatan dharma and hence, only those people who belong to this religion will be allowed inside,” said Randhawa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/right-wing-group-puts-posters-saying-entry-of-non-hindus-banned-inside-premises-outside-temples-in-doon/articleshow/81608139.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Delhi||Ashoka row: Over 150 international academics support Pratap Bhanu Mehta||NEW DELHI: Over 150 international academics came out in support of Pratap Bhanu Mehta on Friday, days after he resigned from Ashoka University, citing the management’s insecurities over his criticism of the government. The letter described his resignation as a “dangerous attack” on academic freedom. Former RBI governor and economist Raghuram Rajan also expressed solidarity with Mehta in a blog posted on his LinkedIn profile. “Mehta is a thorn in the side of the establishment,” he wrote. The open letter was addressed to the trustees, administration and faculty of Ashoka. Among those who signed the letter were Canadian philosopher Charles Taylor, professor of philosophy and law Kwame Appiah (New York University), Yale English professor David Bromwich, social scientist Partha Chatterjee (Columbia University), Oxford history professor Faisal Devji, Lawrence Lessig (Harvard Law School), philosopher Martha C Nussbaum (University of Chicago) and Harvard humanities professor Homi K Bhabha. “We write in solidarity with Pratap Bhanu Mehta, and to reaffirm the importance of the values that he has always practiced. In political life, these are free arguments, tolerance, and a democratic spirit of equal citizenship. In the university, they are free inquiry, candor, and a rigorous distinction between the demands of intellectual honesty and the pressure of politicians, funders, or ideological animus. These values come under assault whenever a scholar is punished for the content of public speech. When that speech is in defense of precisely these values, the assault is especially shameful,” the letter said. “The university must be a home for fearless inquiry and criticism. We support Pratap Bhanu Mehta in his practice of the highest values of intellectual inquiry and public life,” the letter further said. Mehta’s exit was followed by another high-profile resignation, when former chief economic advisor Arvind Subramanian quit as faculty, also in solidarity with Mehta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ashoka-row-over-150-intl-academics-support-mehta/articleshow/81609667.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Covid-19 patient on ventilator dies due to power outage||Warangal: A Covid-19 patient admitted in Warangal’s Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Hospital died on Saturday morning after his ventilator machine shut down due to a sudden power cut and the staff failed to switch on the power backup. N Hari Gandhi, 38, hailing from Jammikunta of Karimnagar district was admitted with Covid-19 on February 24. Initially, he was showing some signs of improvement, his family members said, before his condition worsened and he had to be put on ventilator on March 6. Hospital superintendent Nagarjun Reddy told reporters that Gandhi’s condition had turned critical and the doctors were trying their best to save him. “Since his condition was critical, we put him on ventilator. However, due to unforeseen circumstances, the patient died when the ventilator stopped working due to a power cut,” he said. Hospital authorities said, Gandhi was gasping for breath when the ventilator stopped. “We tried to restore the power quickly with the help of a generator, but due to a technical issue it did not start immediately and we lost the patient,” Reddy said. Angry parents blamed the hospital for Gandhi’s death. Gandhi’s father Nule Mallaiah, 81, said his son was first put on oxygen and later on ventilator support. “How can you have a power cut like this in a hospital at 11.30 am when the hospital is teeming with people? I got them whatever medicines they wanted and even expensive injections whenever they asked, but what is the use,” Mallaiah, a retired driver, said. Gandhi is survived by his wife and two daughters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covid-19-patient-on-ventilator-dies-due-to-power-outage/articleshow/81610215.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Non-teaching posts in Haryana varsities to be filled through HSSC||CHANDIGARH: The Haryana government has decided to bring the recruitment process of Group-C and D posts of universities under the purview of Haryana Staff Selection Commission (HSSC). The move, however, is being described by some as an attempt to “weaken the autonomy of state universities”. As per the plan, these posts in the state universities would be filled through the common eligibility test (CET) conducted by the HSSC, which is the state recruitment agency. A communication in this regard has been sent by the Haryana chief secretary office to the concerned authorities for making necessary changes in the university Acts. As of now, the state universities, being autonomous institutions, have the independent powers to make recruitments at their own without the intervention or interference of the state government. There are 18 state universities in Haryana. The decision to make recruitments on Group-C and D posts of the universities through HSSC has been taken after receiving consent from the vice-chancellors (VCs) of all the state run universities. “A meeting of the state higher education council held on January 13, 2021, under the chairmanship of the chief minister. It was decided with the consent of the VCs of the universities that non-teaching personnel (other than the registrar including deputy/assistant registrar, finance officer, DPE, librarian, deputy/assistant librarian) would be recruited through the HSSC through the one-time registration and common eligibility test (CET) process currently put in place for Group-C and D posts in the state of Haryana,” says the communication issued by the general administration department of chief secretary’s office. The communication has been sent to the administrative secretaries of the department of medical education and research, department of agriculture, higher education and technical education department Haryana. As these departments’ deals with related universities, the chief secretary’s communication has asked them for issuing the directions to all the universities under their jurisdiction and control “to proceed further for necessary amendment in the act immediately”. On the other hand, former Haryana bureaucrat R S Chaudhary, who had also served as vice-chancellor of the Kurukshetra University, alleged that such an action by the state government are an attack on autonomous bodies and government was setting a wrong precedent. “Every university has it own rules and regulations regarding the service conditions. Even vice-chancellor’s consent for such move immaterial because such decisions are to be cleared by the executive council of the universities,” Chaudhary added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/non-teaching-posts-in-state-varsities-to-be-filled-through-hssc/articleshow/81609643.cms||Ajay Sura
---||Meerut||'Sugarcane leopards' of Bijnor giving farmers nightmares||BIJNOR: “Sugarcane leopards" of Bijnor are giving farmers nightmares. There are over a hundred of them hiding in the cane fields. Between February and May, the breeding season, sightings on sugarcane farms go up to 20 a month. Initially, farmers like Shoorveer Singh had accepted the presence of leopards sauntering through the sugarcane farms as helpful. But with increasing leopard-human conflict and the ever-hanging fear of death, they have made up their minds — they want the leopards to be relocated. Forest officials aren't sure how the relocation of so many big cats will happen. They have been telling farmers that the leopards are their friends. “They prey on dogs, goats, stray cattle, Nilgai alves, rabbits, jackals and pigs. Many of these destroy farmers’ crops. So, the leopards do help farmers,” Bijnor divisional forest officer M Semmaran said. Farmers do not deny that. “It is true that the big cats wipe out the animals that destroy our crops,” Shoorveer said. But it’s not worth the risk, he believes. “They have started attacking us, killing us. We live in constant fear.” In two years, nine people have died in conflict with leopards in Bijnor. In retaliation, humans, too, have killed leopards. First, on January 6 last year at Bhogpur, where a leopard was shot dead. An FIR was lodged against 80 people. And the second time, a few months ago at Mahojam Sadat, where a leopard was stoned to death. Three people were booked. Why it recurs is shrinking territory. Bijnor has two forest divisions — Bijnor and Najibabad — that cover 11 ranges over a 50,000-hectare area. Out of that, a forest officer said, about 1,000 hectare has been encroached upon by some 220 Van Gujjar families and farmers. They have over 3,200 cattle heads, who graze on forest land. And within the Bijnor forest division lies the Amangarh Tiger Reserve, home to 24 tigers now, up from 13 less than a decade ago. “Grasslands are shrinking, herbivores are moving towards farm lands and tigers are expanding their territory. Leopards, following their prey base and leaving the ever-increasing territory of tigers alone, are moving away to sugarcane farms on the fringes,” said Saad Bin Asif, a registered hunter who has killed 13 maneaters. “Some cases of conflict have come up. We have urged farmers to be cautious and have set up a task force. We have a tranquiliser gun. If any animal turns aggressive, it will be relocated,” DFO Semmaran acknowledged. The forest department has also advised the use of whistles, drums and helmets while farming. This, the farmers counter. Shoorveer said, “Instead of asking us to change how we live and work, the forest authorities should relocate the leopards."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/over-100-leopards-hiding-in-bijnors-sugarcane-fields/articleshow/81608140.cms||Harveer Dabas

---||Jaipur||State Mineral Exploration Trust yet to begin operations||Jaipur: State Mineral Exploration Trust created last September with the lofty objectives of exploring minor mineral riches of the state and attracting better private sector participation is yet to move the needle. Even after six months have passed since the creation of the trust through a notification, it remains non-functional. Sources in the Department of Mines and Geology (DMG) said the state government is yet to release the funds to the trust collected from mines owners under the rules.Under the rules of the trust, all the mining and quarry lease holders are required to pay 2% of the royalty they pay to the state government. The corpus will be used by the trust to carry out it’s activities. The trust is modelled after the National Mineral Exploration Trust which also gets a contribution from the major mineral lease holders to undertake exploration work in the country.In the past, the DMG has made a string of global standard discoveries like zinc and lead mines of Rampura Agucha, limestones blocks which has been auctioned to eight cement companies and rockphosphate in Jhamarkotra. But exploration activities tapered down in recent years with no budgetary support.“Now, there is no dedicated budget for exploration as it was in the past. That is the reason why the new drillings have fallen by 75%. The trust was created to bring focus back on exploration along with adoption of new technology and capacity building. But without funds, the trust has no meaning,” said an official.Mining is a high risk business. Industry estimates suggest only about 10% of mines reach a profitable production stage and others don’t become viable. But the failure-success ratio goes up significantly if exploration is done. “If the mineral data, estimated after exploration, is available, the investor appetite improves significantly. The blocks in auctions fetch better rates,” said the source. In a recent department meeting, principal secretary Ajitabh Sharma had listed the merits of putting up the mineral exploration data on websites to attract better private participation in auctions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/state-mineral-exploration-trust-yet-to-begin-operations/articleshow/81609103.cms||---

---||Chennai||NTK Tamil nationalism slogan could chip away votes of AIADMK, DMK||A couple of years ago, an IT company based in Chennai sought the advice of Nasscom, the Indian IT industry body, after two software engineers were involved in fisticuffs in the company’s cafeteria. Nasscom too was concerned, since it was the first time such a thing has been reported in the industry. The reason behind the fisticuff – one engineer spoke ill about Naam Thamizhar Katchi leader Seeman. While that remained a rare incident, it nevertheless turned out to be an eye opener about Seeman’s expanding core support group, which initially comprised young rural voters and independent voters, not attached to the national parties like the BJP and the Congress or the DMK and the AIADMK. Seeman began cultivating his base from the roots by targeting micro communities, which felt edged out by the larger political parties that themselves are indirectly dominated by larger castes. Soon enough, people from other dominant castes neglected in their own parties started moving towards him, attracted by his rabblerousing speeches. Built on the Tamil nationalism plank, NTK considers the DMK as its political enemy and the BJP as the ideological enemy.  It considers Congress too as the other side of the same BJP coin. Hence, the three parties are its primary target. He largely spares the AIADMK. With a focus to hit out at the root of Dravidianism by attacking the DMK, Seeman wants NTK to emerge as the alternate narrative with the focus on Tamil nationalism in the state and not BJP’s Hindutva rhetoric. With a uniform support base across the state, NTK would spoil votes heading to either of the alliances at different places. Seeman’s party has been around since 2010. But made its electoral debut only in the 2016 assembly election, having extended support to J Jayalalithaa-led AIADMK in 2011 assembly and 2014 Lok Sabha election. It surprised all by fielding its own candidates in all the 234 assembly seats in 2016, a feat it repeated in 2019 and is repeating now in 2021. The party does not believe in getting into the alliance imbroglio. Seeman is keen to build a base on his own and head an alliance in future, if needed. It has created a core vote bank, that has grown from 1.1% in 2016 assembly polls to close to 4% in 2019 LS election and reportedly 10% vote share in the local body polls. Though official data was never released, it is safe to say NTK has joined the 5% club political parties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/ntk-tamil-nationalism-slogan-could-chip-away-votes-of-aiadmk-dmk/articleshow/81609668.cms||D Govardan

---||Dehradun||CM inaugurates projects worth Rs 120 crore, reiterates that ‘everyone is free to visit Kumbh’ but skips question on whether RT-PCR report is necessary for pilgrims||HARIDWAR: Chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat on Saturday inaugurated 36 Kumbh-related works worth Rs 120 crore in Haridwar and inspected the pace of the ongoing works with officials. He also met with Bairagi akhadas’ seers who had been protesting against non-allotment of land for setting up their camps and assured them of all possible assistance. However, he did not clear the air on whether RT-PCR report for Covid-19 will be mandatory for pilgrims coming for the festival. Soon after taking over as CM, Rawat had said that there would be no requirement of the RT-PCR test report for visiting the mega festival. However, according to the guidelines issued by the Centre, RT-PCR negative test has been made mandatory. When asked to clarify on the confusion and whether or not the report would continue to be mandatory, Rawat chose not to give a direct answer and said that “everyone is free to visit Haridwar for taking part in Kumbh mela but Union government guidelines regarding Covid-19 must be followed”. He further said that “a negative environment was created about the Kumbh mela” which he is trying to dispel. “We have permitted seers to set up their camps outside the akhada premises and allotted land to them while earlier, the seers were forced to install their camp inside the akhada premises. The seer community is happy with this decision,” he added. Meanwhile, seers and local traders chose to interpret CM’s statement as a green signal for pilgrims to come to Kumbh without the need for Covid-19 test report or registration. “We are telling our followers to come unhindered to the Kumbh Mela without any Covid test since the CM has said that there will be no unnecessary stopping of pilgrims,” said Mahant Dharamdas, a Bairagi seer. Meanwhile, Mela police officials said that they are making preparations according to the SOPs of the Union government. Kumbh Mela IG Sanjay Gunjyal told TOI, “We will follow the central government guidelines for the Kumbh mela in which RT-PCR negative report along with registration is mandatory.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/cm-inaugurates-projects-worth-rs-120-crore-reiterates-that-everyone-is-free-to-visit-kumbh-but-skips-question-on-whether-rt-pcr-report-is-necessary-for-pilgrims/articleshow/81608156.cms||MS Nawaz

However, he announced some relief in the conditions that were in force till March 21. The new relaxation will come into effect from Monday. Separate SOPs will be issued for March 28 and 29 (Holi), a notification issued by municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B stated. “All shops, including those dealing in non-essential goods, can stay open till 4pm, while restaurants and food joints can remain open till 7pm,” said Raut. All essential shops like medical stores, media houses, fuel stations, banks, insurance services, gas agencies, India Post, cold storage facilities, agriculture produce markets, Mahatma Phule Market (Cotton Market), Santra Market etc are exempted from the 4pm curbs. While schools, colleges will continue to remain closed, all government, semi-government and private offices can function at 25% strength. New conditions allow three persons to travel in a four-and three-wheeler and two persons on a two-wheeler. Raut said the curbs will be strictly implemented in areas under Nagpur police commissionerate and they included the city, Hingna, Koradi, Kamptee and adjoining areas. Speaking to the media after a series of review meetings with city’s public representatives, including leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis, MLC Pravin Datke and MLA Krishna Khopde and others, Raut said the coronavirus cases continue to rise during the last week’s lockdown. “On March 15, the positive cases were 2,000 which jumped to 3,500 by the weekend,” he said. It’s for the first time, the energy minister had invited public representatives, particularly from the opposition BJP, in the review meeting. He also spoke to Union minister Nitin Gadkari, Ramtek MP Krupal Tumane and state home minister Anil Deshmukh through videoconferencing to know their views. He also interacted with the representatives of organizations like Nag Vidarbha Chamber of Commerce (NVCC) and others. Fadnavis opposed complete lockdown and stressed the need for extension of restrictions in Saturday’s review meeting. He also suggested constituting a team of experts to ascertain the reason for the spike in the cases in the state. Assuring that the restrictions would not put the general public to any inconvenience, Raut said the administration would try to meet the target of vaccination over 6.87 lakh citizens who’re over 45 years of age with comorbidities. “We currently have 88 vaccination centres in the city and 89 in rural areas. Tomorrow, 21 new centres will be added in rural areas. We plan to increase city centres to 121 to expedite the vaccination. We’re also targeting 40,000 vaccinations per day from the current 20,000. We will seek help from public representatives, zilla parishad and NGOs for registration and vaccination,” the guardian minister said. Warning of a strict action against citizens venturing outdoors without a valid reason, Raut said the police have been directed to keep a strict watch on the people’s movement through 3,800 CCTV cameras across the city. “All schools and colleges would remain closed, but examinations are allowed to be held as scheduled. The essential commodities shops would remain opened till 4pm, restaurants can operate till 7pm and home delivery could continue till 11am. We’ve directed the NMC and the CP to take strict action against the violators. We request people to cooperate with us by following the restrictions,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/curbs-extended-till-march-31-with-some-relaxation/articleshow/81609100.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Ahmedabad||Jewellery making to get boost with Gujarat’s first CFC at Rajkot||RAJKOT: Small and medium jewellery manufacturers in and around Rajkot are set to get a fillip with a common facility centre (CFC) expected to be operationalized soon at Diwanpara in Rajkot. This centre for gold and silver jewellery is likely to be the first among the total five planned across India to begin operations, say industry players. A CFC is a pool of high-end and capital-intensive, state-of-the-art machinery or equipment, offering various services at affordable rates, especially beneficial to the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector of the gems and jewellery industry. In order to enable goldsmiths and jewellery manufacturing units in small towns and villages to use cutting-edge technology for jewellery making, Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) has come out with a scheme to establish common facility centres. The central government is sponsoring the scheme. With the cost of adopting state-of-the-art technology and equipment beyond their reach, SME diamond and jewellery units still rely on old technology, which results in low productivity and affects the quality of their finished products. With the establishment of the CFC, jewellery makers in Rajkot will be able to use technology that is being used by the manufacturers globally. “Rajkot is a hub of jewellery making and it will boost the industry and generate more employment,” said Divyesh Patadiya, president, Jewellery Cluster Association, an umbrella body with 50 members that was created to facility CFC project in Rajkot. The Rajkot CFC will have modern equipment such as laser marking machine, laser soldering machine, 3D mould machine for jewellery designing and gold refining machine. The cost of machinery to be installed at the CFC in Rajkot is estimated at Rs 5 crore, which is sponsored by the Union ministry of commerce and industry under its ‘Ratna Abhushan Suvidha Kendra’ project. “There are a few big players in Rajkot who have these types of machinery, but they don’t take up job work. This centre will make available sophisticated machinery to all at a reasonable fee,” said Bharat Ranpariya, a jewellery wholesaler. Rajkot is among the most popular gold and silver jewellery making clusters in India with 80,000 manufacturers, including goldsmiths and individual jewellers. It provides direct and indirect employment to about 3 lakh people. Rajkot is famous for its plain gold jewellery, which includes nose pins, earrings, anklets, and antique jewellery designs among others. “Usually schemes are initiated by the government. However, in this case, GJEPC prepared the scheme and requested the government to sponsor it. The government’s grant is provided to local associations through GJEPC,” said Dinesh Navadiya, regional chairman, GJEPC. According to him, the local jewellery association then selects the state-of-the-art machinery according to their requirements and provides the service to the industry stakeholders. They charge nominal fees to cover their administrative cost. “Common facility centres are currently being set up in Delhi, Kolkata, Jaipur, Hyderabad and Coimbatore. However, looking at the progress of Rajkot CFC, we believe that it would be the first to be made operational in a very short period,” he added. “The CFC will break the monopoly of few big manufacturers and now the smaller ones will also be able to offer all kinds of designs. With the availability of new technology to all the manufacturers, our yearly sales are expected to grow by 20-25%. Even exports are expected to get a boost as we will be able to provide delicate jewellery with modern designs,” said Bhayabhai Soni, president, Gold Dealers Association of Rajkot. According to jewellers, the CFC will also place Rajkot at par with Coimbatore, which is also considered a hub of jewellery design in the country. They will not have to send their jewellery to Ahmedabad or Mumbai for certain work and will not have to fear of their designs getting stolen. As sales and exports increase, it will also generate more employment. The jewellery association is also mulling to make representation to the government to provide a jewellery design training centre in Rajkot, where they can groom new talent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/jewellery-making-to-get-boost-with-states-first-cfc-at-rajkot/articleshow/81609123.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

On Friday, Una deputy commissioner had issued directions to impose Rs 5,000 fine on people found without masks. Thakur told the House that Rs 5,000 fine was too much for not wearing a mask. He, however, said people of the state should understand the seriousness of the situation, because the second wave of coronavirus was spreading fast. He said everyone knew why there was a need to re-implement the Covid-19 restrictions strictly. He said Covid-19 was about to end, but negligence allowed it to spread again. Earlier, health minister Rajiv Saizal appealed to all the members of the House and people of the state to strictly follow Covid appropriate behaviour. He said the state government was taking all possible steps to deal with the second wave, but it was not possible without the cooperation of the general public. He also appealed to all legislators and ministers to motivate people to strictly follow SOPs. On this issue, leader of opposition Mukesh Agnihotri requested the CM to take effective steps to make people aware to avoid coronavirus. He also opposed imposing fine of Rs 5,000 on those who did not wear masks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/no-rs-5k-fine-for-not-wearing-mask-thakur/articleshow/81609104.cms||---

Apart from the vaccinated lot, the new norm gives exemption from institutional quarantine to six other categories of passengers, including those aged over 65, women in advanced stage of pregnancy and passengers with serious illnesses. Under norms passed on January 20, all passengers arriving from or transiting from those destinations had to undergo mandatory institutional quarantine for seven days followed by seven days of home quarantine on arrival here. The January order had no room for exemption. Under the new order, exemption from week-long institutional quarantine has been granted to those mentioned above and others, like both parents accompanying children aged below five. Passengers with serious illnesses that require immediate medical attention, such as cancer, severe physical disability, mental illness and cerebral palsy can skip quarantine if they have supporting medical documents. Passengers facing extreme family distress like father, mother, son, daughter in critical condition (on death bed), serious accident in family, death of immediate family member too will be exempted from institutional quarantine if they provide “convincing documents’’ to airport staff, said the order. Medical professionals who intend to travel for life-saving surgery or attend to critical patients are exempted from institutional quarantine if they furnish proof from the hospital where they are to perform the surgery or provide medical service. .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bmc-scraps-its-quarantine-rule-for-flyers-with-2-jabs-in-mumbai/articleshow/81609687.cms||Manju V

People brought their pets for various diseases such as pyometra, gasto-related ailments, among others. We also took care of a lot of strays,” said HIS managing trustee Timmie Kumar.After the Pushkar Camel Fair was hit last year because of the pandemic, poor camel owners, who survived mainly on the annual tourist season, had to leave their camels in the wild.“With the long and continuing ban on international tourism, camel owners had no work and no money to feed their animals. The camel owners said around 300–400 camels succumbed to starvation and various diseases during the pandemic. In November, our camel team got an emergency call from Pushkar. Word spread quickly and a good number gathered eagerly on the spot for us to examine and treat the ailments of their camels. It was a very happy moment for them to see our team and to receive free treatment. We treated 80 camels in our daylong camp at Pushkar,” said a HIS member.On Saturday, HIS celebrated its 41st birthday. On the occasion, the staff, volunteers and friends of the charity competed and bonded over sports and games. They were also recognised with commemorative mementos and prizes were given away to the winning teams.On the occasion Timmie Kumar said: “We are excited to celebrate another year of helping animals who otherwise would be helpless within the community. I want to express my gratitude to the hardworking team for ensuring we can do what we have been doing for 41 years. It is also heart-warming to see so many compassionate people bring in street animals for treatments. This shows that we as Jaipur have transitioned into a caring city. We hope to continue supporting animal guardians and the animals they save.”HIS’s Animal Birth Control (ABC Programme), which was set up 26 years ago to create a rabies-free, stable and acceptable street dog population in Jaipur, vaccinated a large number of street dogs against rabies and sterilized bitches.Last year, despite the great disruption caused by Covid, the ABC Programme gave rabies vaccine to 5,605 of Jaipur’s street dogs, of which 2,693 were also sterilized.Rabies is a fatal zoonotic disease of man and all mammals. It is spread by the saliva of infected animals, chiefly through dog bites. It kills about 20,000 people each year in India, most of whom are poor, disadvantaged children, generally boys.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/this-hosp-kept-its-doors-open-for-animals-during-lockdown/articleshow/81609106.cms||---

According to data released by the school education department, 7.6 lakh students from class 9 and class 10, out of 10 lakh students, attended classes on Saturday. The attendance of class 6 to class 8 students is comparatively less, at about 4.34 lakh students of 6.7 lakh. Parents said that although there is no significant drop in the percentage of students attending physical classes in the state, there is a drastic decrease in schools where positive cases have been reported. “This week, three class 10 students from my child’s school tested positive for Covid-19. Ever since, none of the class 10 students are coming to school.

---||Chennai||Singanallur: DMK, MNM try to play it safe, but AIADMK’s all for gamble||Singanallur assembly segment is headed for a triangular contest this time. While MNM vice-president R Mahendran, a heavyweight in the district, has thrown his hat in the ring, the DMK has retained sitting MLA N Karthik seeking to attract naidu votes. The AIADMK went by local minister S P Velumani’s choice and fielded a gounder, K R Jayaram, a realtor. Naidus are the dominant community in this urban constituency. Gounders are the second largest segment and the rest, comprising about 15%-20%, are working class, people who had migrated from various parts of the state to Singanallur to work in more than two dozen mills that thrived in the region for many decades. Singanallur has tried out many political parties such as the Praja Socialist Party, CPM, Janata Party and the two Dravidian majors since 1967. The DMK has won it four times and the AIADMK thrice in the last 40 years. In between, the Janata Party and the CPM had won once each, but significantly, Singanallur was the only seat the AIADMK lost out of the 10 constituencies in Coimbatore district in the 2016 assembly elections. Perhaps the key to the AIADMK’s questions as to what went wrong lies in the caste matrix. Though Mahendran does not belong to either of the two dominant segments, he could put up a tough fight as his mother tongue is Telugu. He had polled 1.44 lakh votes in the last parliamentary elections in Coimbatore constituency. Of that, 28,634 votes were from Singanallur. Interestingly, Mahendran and Jayaram are among the richest candidates in the state. Mahendran said caste was never a factor in his party’s choice of candidates. "We have selected candidates who would work hard for the people," said Mahendran. He has plans to release a manifesto for Singanallur within a week. Analysts feel the AIADMK may have got the caste arithmetic wrong in Singanallur and it should have fielded a naidu to take on the DMK. They also point to another contradiction; the party has fielded a naidu in Goundampalayam, where gounders are the dominant community. An AIADMK leader sought to explain saying, "We expect naidu votes to split in Singanallur. Hence, if we consolidate gounder votes, we can easily win there". The party tried it unsuccessfully in 2016. The segment has about 5,000 MSMEs, severely affected after demonetization. The DMK is hopeful that with the help of the CPM and CPI, it can rally the working class against the BJP and the AIADMK. Jayaram has been working in the constituency by distributing food grains and groceries to the poor in the region ever since the pandemic started. "When people were suffering from the pandemic, DMK leaders including Karthik were busy attending video conferences," charged Jayaram.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/singanallur-dmk-mnm-try-to-play-it-safe-but-aiadmks-all-for-gamble/articleshow/81609688.cms||A Subburaj

The student government stated that with the resignations "not only have we lost intellectual giants and erudite academics whose scholarship we value deeply, but also our trust and faith in this administration to protect the students within this university from external political pressures, specifically the vice-chancellor (Professor Malabika Sarkar), the chancellor (Professor Rudrangshu Mukherjee), and the founders of this university”. The student body has demanded that the founders publicly acknowledge Mehta’s statement that he felt he was a “political liability” and assure the Ashokan community that Mehta will be given a public and unconditional offer letter of reinstatement. It also wants an open meeting between the founders and the student government on the issue as well as the divesting of administrative powers and roles from the founders to the elected representatives of faculty, students and administration.

On Saturday, she was the recipient of the canvassing strength of her old foe and deputy CM O Panneerselvam, who concluded his city campaign at Ice House. Beginning Saturday’s campaign trail at West Mambalam, OPS campaigned for AIADMK candidates of B Sathya (T Nagar), S Duraisamy (Saidapet) and V N Ravi (Virugambakkam) and continued his campaign at T P Chatham, Kolathur, Thiru-Vi-Ka Nagar, Royapuraam and concluded at Ice house, where he canvassed for coalition candidates, AVA Kasali of PMK and BJP’s Khushbu. Cadres from all parties were gathered at Ice house since 7pm. Some grew impatient worrying whether OPS would be a no show. "Yesterday (Friday), we had gathered at Mylapore but we were told that he couldn’t make it due to time constraints," said G Govindammal. A section of workers kept themselves entertained by dancing to MGR songs that were played until OPS arrived. Traffic was affected at the junction near Triplicane high road and senior functionaries requested the cadres to not disrupt traffic. Khushbu was received with applause amid murmurs from a section about her shifting allegiances just before the election.  "There are so many video memes of Khushbu’s speeches from the past and present," said N Jegan, who had come to see the campaign. OPS arrived around 9.30pm and used the available minutes to praise the good governance of the AIADMK. Appealing to the public to vote for the alliance candidates, OPS said the BJP-led government at the Centre has been helpful to the state. "People call me jallikattu hero.

---||Jaipur||4 city areas turn into safe havens for drug peddlers, cops begin crackdown||Jaipur: Four areas in Jaipur have become safe havens for drug peddlers in the recent past. During its ongoing operation ‘clean sweep’ aiming at curbing the menace of contraband substance in the city, Jaipur police identified Galta Gate, Bhatta Basti, Idgah and Jalupura as major points of sale and consumption of drugs.Since the operation began in March 2020, 677 people have been arrested under various sections of NDPS Act.Police say that the operation started to destroy the network of drug peddlers in the city has thrown major surprise for them when they realised that four out of five cases were being reported from the same areas. The narrow alleys and cramped living in these areas provide much-needed shelter to the peddlers. Those arrested come from low-income families with common features being unemployment, petty jobs, and school dropouts. Police initially target roadside vendors selling contraband. Thereafter, they moved to the narrow alleys and started raiding houses. In some cases, they find entire families involved in the business.The youngest person arrested by them was 16 years old while the oldest is nearing seventies. “Our data analysis and investigation reports indicate that many accused had no idea that they are committing a crime. The situation is very grave and is spoiling the youth of our society. It is high time that the society comes forward to curb the menace,” said Digant Anand, DCP (Crime), Jaipur Commissionerate. Most of the peddlers and addicts take the advantage of legal loopholes which allows them to take bail from police station if the quantity is less. “Since the operation is continuing, peddlers have devised a new strategy by keeping small quantities of the banned substance which allows them to escape the law. Carrying smack below 5 grams and ganja below 2kg would allow thebeginm to take bail at the police station,” said Sulesh Choudhary, ADCP (Crime) Jaipur Commissionerate. Police have cleared that they have been reporting cases from several parts of the city, but some areas have reported abnormally high number of cases. The crime team has mapped areas which are most vulnerable to drugs consumption. The team has given credit to inputs being provided to police by locals. Since locals are aware of the ongoing operation, they now provide information to police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/4-city-areas-turn-into-safe-havens-for-drug-peddlers-cops-begin-crackdown/articleshow/81609148.cms||---

Our nine ventilators were occupied too,” he said. At BMC’s jumbo facilities too, downscaling plans made in early February were discarded as cases began to rise. Cases have risen four times between February 15 and now. The second wave, as experts call the present surge, has however not had the same effect on hospital beds. “Beds are not available in the private sector where the number of beds was reduced, but public hospitals have enough vacant beds,” said a civic doctor. Read AlsoCovid surge: Centre identifies 70 'districts of concern'; most in MaharashtraNEW DELHI: The Union health ministry on Wednesday said that as many as 70 districts across India have reported more than 150 per cent rise in active coronavirus cases in the first 15 days of the month as the nation stares at a fresh surge in infections. Maharashtra, which is the worst-affected stateThe civic dashboard says it too — only 53% of 12,694 Covid beds in the city were occupied on Saturday. About 40% of ICU beds and 52% of oxygen-support beds are vacant.   This second wave in the state, as Dr Pradeep Awate, head of the epidemiology cell of the state public health department, said, is milder but more transmissible. The number of deaths in the city and state have been a fraction of what they were during peak(s) of the first wave in May-June 2020 and September-October 2020 periods. Read AlsoLockdown is an option, says CM Uddhav Thackeray as Maharashtra’s cases riseAs the signs of a second Covid-19 wave became apparent on Friday—25,000-plus cases in Maharashtra for the second consecutive day and Mumbai breaching the 3,000 mark for the first time—CM Uddhav Thackeray reiterated that a lockdown is still an option. Thackeray said the situation has become grimmer.The state’s weekly case fatality rate from February 15 to 21 was 0.7%, which declined to 0.32% in the last six days between March 15 and 20. In this period, the weekly cases have tripled. New cases reported in the week between February 15 and 21 were 36,606 and 259 fatalities were reported, while the state added 1.34 lakh from March 15 to 20 and 439 fatalities have been reported so far. For Mumbai, which has reported fatalities in single digits since January, weekly fatality rate dipped from 0.5% in mid-February to 0.27% in last six days since March 15. Read AlsoMaharashtra minister Aaditya Thackeray tests Covid positiveMaharashtra minister and Shiv Sena leader Aaditya Thackeray on Saturday said that he has tested positive for Covid-19.Aadtiya, the son of Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, said that he had mild symptoms of Covid and requested everyone who came in contact with him to get themselves tested.State public health minister Rajesh Tope said that while cases in the state are on the rise, a silver lining is that fatality rate hasn't risen. “But we’re urging people to seek medical help as soon as they see symptoms,” he said. A senior doctor from a south Mumbai hospital said that the Covid graph in Maharashtra, especially Mumbai, is similar to the European wave albeit three to four months behind. “Our peaks follow theirs a few months later,” he said. In Europe, the second wave was mild and saw a tenth of first-wave deaths. In a study in indexed journal, Chaos, last week, researchers from University of Sydney showed that many European nations saw a 10-fold fall in mortality in the second wave. They said it could be since the first wave case count was too low (hence showing higher fatality rate) and second-wave infections were among younger people than the elderly who were hit in the first phase. In Mumbai, too, BMCobserved that the 20-40 age group makes up for most patients in February-March.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/covid-graph-of-mumbai-city-state-mirrors-europes-milder-2nd-wave/articleshow/81609702.cms||Malathy Iyer

Participating in the discussion on deduction proposals on demands for grants, members of opposition raised issues related to the Covid pandemic, along with vacant posts of doctors and paramedical staff in various state hospitals. CPM MLA Rakesh Singha raised the issue of procurement made during the Covid pandemic under the Disaster Management Act, alleging considerable rigging in the purchase. He also spoke about investigation of this purchase in the House. Replying to the discussion, health minister Rajiv Saizal said positive suggestions of the opposition would be included in the health policy. He said the opposition was trying to project that nothing had been done on the health services front. According to him, the present government recruited 1,500 doctors in three years due to shortage of doctors during the previous government. On the Covid situation, he said the opposition should realise on examination of the condition of neighbouring states that Himachal is better off. He accused the opposition leaders of undermining the contribution of doctors and nurses by raising questions on the management of the Covid pandemic. Saizal said the government is making efforts to make the Ayurvedic College at Paprola in Kangra district an all-India level institution. Informing that the government had deployed doctors in primary health centres, he said he would hold informal talks with members of the opposition. Earlier, Rajendra Rana, Lakhvinder Rana, Mohan Lal Barakta, Sundar Thakur, Vikramaditya Singh, Inder Dutt Lakhanpal and Colonel Dhani Ram Shandil from the Congress raised issues of health services in their respective constituencies. They demanded filling of vacant posts and raised issues of buildings. CM rallies to Saizal’s defenceOn the last day of the budget session, a question on the health department by Congress MLA from Naina Devi and former minister Ram Lal Thakur as well as BJP MLA from Jhanduta, J R Katwal evoked a 21-minute discussion during question hour. When Ram Lal Thakur tried to corner the government, chief minister Jai Ram Thakur came forward in defence of health minister Rajiv Saizal. The Congress MLA remarked that if the government could not provide medical staff to the area of the opposition MLA, all health institutions in Bilaspur should be closed. He also said the decision to not deploy nurses in the state PHC was wrong and added that in the absence of facilities, the regional hospital of Bilaspur had become a referral hospital. In response, Saizal said the current government does not deploy staff on the basis of party, region and class and that among all districts, Bilaspur had better staff position.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/oppn-tries-to-corner-govt-on-health-issues-during-covid-pandemic/articleshow/81609150.cms||---

Apart from 3,100 domain experts to combat specialised crimes, 10,000 police officials will be recruited, of which 33% will be women, at the level of sub-inspectors and constables, to expand the ground force and ensure more effective policing, said the chief minister. Announcing the move, aimed at further strengthening the state’s law enforcement machinery to address the new challenges of policing and investigation, Amarinder said after stabilising the law and order situation over the past four years, his government was now focusing on augmenting law enforcement further, with more touchpoints to tackle the new-age crimes, like digital/cyber crimes, and enhance the safety and security of women and other vulnerable sections of the society. With the changing nature of crime necessitating support and interventions by domain experts for the effective prevention and detection of crime, the Punjab Police would soon recruit around 3,100 specialist police officers and domain experts in the fields of law, forensics, digital forensics, information technology, data mining, cyber security, intelligence analysis, human resource management and development and road safety planning and engineering, said CM Amarinder, who also holds the home portfolio. The CM said the initiative, designed to transform the police force, will make Punjab the first state in the country to induct domain experts to take the police department to the next level. Director general of police (DGP) Dinkar Gupta said the domain experts would include around 600 law graduates, 450 crime scene investigators, about 1,350 IT experts with specialist qualifications and experience in law, commerce, forensics, digital forensics, data mining and data analysis for deployment as cyber detectives, financial detectives, homicide detectives, sexual assault and rape detectives. In addition, the Punjab government will also recruit around 460 qualified and trained counsellors, clinical psychologists and community and victim support officers for deployment at the family counselling centres and women help desks in all districts. To further augment women power in the police department, 3,400 new women police officials will be recruited as part of the drive to enrol 10,000 more police officials in the Punjab Police, mostly in the rank of sub-inspectors and constables. This translates into 33% women of the total recruitment, in line with the state government’s commitment to provide equal opportunity to women to compete with men for various positions in thePunjab Police, said Gupta. Out of the total recruitment of women, about 300 women will be recruited as sub-inspectors and more than 3,100 would be inducted as constables.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/state-to-recruit-13k-cops-and-experts/articleshow/81609168.cms||---

---||Pune||Man murders relative, stages accident to mislead police||Pune: A 35-year-old man on Friday murdered his relative over a family feud and tried to make it look like an accident. Police were not fooled and arrested him on Saturday. The incident occurred near Malavli on the Pune-Mumbai Expressway. Police said the suspect, Ramdas Bhimaji Ozarkar — driving a car — chased Satish Chandrakant Ozarkar (32), knocked him off his motorcycle and bludgeoned him to death with an iron rod. He then arranged the body and the motorcycle to make it seem like Satish met with a fatal accident. The Lonavla (rural) police, after studying the accident spot and the body, concluded that it was pre-meditated murder — there were no signs (broken glass, tyre marks, etc) associated with a road accident. Further, the deceased was injured on his face and head, and nowhere else, police said. A team comprising deputy superintendent of police Navnit Kawat, inspector T Y Mujawar, assistant inspector Nilesh Mane and sub-inspector Anil Lawate tracked down and arrested Ramdas in Talegaon. Under questioning, Ramdas confessed to the crime. Inspector Mujawar told TOI that Ramdas was a farmer while Satish ran a dairy business. They stay in Ozarde village. Mujawar said the duo had a bitter falling out on Wednesday. “Satish hurled abuses at Ramdas’s parents and other relatives. Ramdas was enraged and wamted revenge,” he said. “On Friday, when Satish left home for Lonavla, Ramdas started following him in his car,” he said. Once Satish entered the expressway, Ramdas rammed Satish’s motorcycle, making him fall. “Ramdas stopped, got an iron rod out of the boot and hit Satish on his head, killing him, and fled” Mujawar said. “We combed through CCTV footage from different spots and saw Ramdas’ car following Satish from the village. That’s how we zeroed in on Ramdas,” Mujawar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/man-murders-relative-stages-accident-to-mislead-police/articleshow/81608660.cms||---

Nanak had lost his son, brother, and three cousins in the blood bath. Nanak still remembers how the masked gunmen had dragged the Sikh men out of their homes and made them stand in two queues before killing them on March 20, 2020, a day before the visit of the then US president Bill Clinton to India. Nanak himself had sustained injuries and survived after treatment at various places, including Amritsar. In the memory of their slain near and dear ones, the Sikhs of J&K have begun akhand path both at Jammu and Chittisinghpura, the bhog of which would be performed on Sunday. Nanak said till date government has failed to pinpoint the terrorist group that had attacked. “There appears to be a big game plan behind the incident. That’s why both the Congress as well as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) governments did not show any sincerity in conducting an inquiry and fixing responsibility of the incident on any group,” he alleged. Babu Singh who also lost his relatives in the incident said a few days after the Chittisinghpura massacre, the government claimed to have gunned down a group of terrorists at Kuthar area, near Chittisinghpura, but upon inquiry, it turned out to be a false claim. He said the government had put up a permanent post of Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) in the area but that was not an answer to their grievances. A Sikh leader from Jammu, Surinder Singh said “We have urged the Modi government to open an inquiry and expose the faces behind the gory attack.” “There are still over 400 Sikh families in Chittisinghpura. We have not forgotten the incident as it has left an indelible mark in our memory. And we need our answers,” Nanak added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/21-yrs-after-chittisinghpura-killings-kin-of-slain-sikhs-look-for-answers/articleshow/81609165.cms||Yudhvir Rana
---||Delhi||High court orders CAG audit of CWG Village flats||New Delhi: Delhi High Court has ordered a CAG audit of the accounts of the Commonwealth Games Village flats from 2012, since when the common area maintenance (CAM) charges are being levied. Justice V Kameswar Rao took the decision after the nodal officer informed the high court that an internal audit has been carried out and further scrutiny of accounts is required. A retired district judge was earlier appointed by the high court as the nodal officer who was permitted to act to the limited extent of making payment of essential service charges. During the hearing on Thursday, all the stakeholders, including the residents’ body, submitted that elections must be held to the Commonwealth Games Village Apartment Owners Association. Before elections are held, an audit of the accounts needs to be carried out, they argued. “Noting the unanimity in the submissions made by the learned counsels for the parties for carrying out the audit by the CAG, This court directs that the audit of the Commonwealth Games Village Apartment Owners Association w.e.f. April 01, 2012, the date on which Common Area Maintenance charges started to be levied, be carried out by the CAG,” the high court said, asking the standing counsel for the national auditor, Gaurang Kanth, to inform in a week’s time which officer would carry out the task. Nodal officer Amar Nath said the administrative officer of the apartment owners association had all books of accounts and other relevant records that would be handed over to the designated officer once the name is conveyed by Kanth. “On being handed over all the relevant records, the CAG shall carry out the audit and place on record before court the audit report. It is expected that the CAG shall complete the audit within a period of 12 weeks from today,” the court ordered. The court also took into account another submission by the flat owners who complained that the towers require maintenance. The owners urged the court to intervene, arguing that it would be best if DDA, which owns certain flats in the complex, carries out a structural audit. DDA agreed to carry out a structural audit and submit the report before the court during the same time period. Spread over 27 acres, the Commonwealth Games Village has 34 residential towers with 1,168 flats. It was developed in a public-private-partnership with DDA to house foreign athletes and officials during the 2010 Commonwealth Games. DDA owns around 700 flats in the residential complex and has been selling them in batches through auctions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/high-court-orders-cag-audit-of-cwg-village-flats/articleshow/81609704.cms||Abhinav Garg

With this, now 81 people of the state who were jailed during emergency in 1975 will get “samman rashi” (honorarium) ranging from Rs 8,000 to Rs 12000. Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur, while placing the bill in the House, said samman rashi is already being given in other states of the country, including Haryana, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh. Congress MLA Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu said if House will not reconsider this bill, he will go to court. He said Bill has been introduced after 45 years and samman rashi is being given to those who were arrested for burning buses and vandalising the offices. CM Thakur said unlike what opposition is claiming, samman rashi is given to people who had raised their voice against emergency, cutting across party lines. He said in Himachal Pradesh less than 100 would be receiving samman rashi, adding that people who were jailed for 15 days during emergency will get Rs 8,000 and those remained in jail for more than 15 days will get Rs 12,000. Leader of Opposition Mukesh Agnihotri said the bill has been brought at the wrong time after the budget was passed. He said bill should have been introduced earlier so that discussion could be held on this.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/himachal-pradesh-loktantra-prahari-bill-passed/articleshow/81609158.cms||---
---||Goa||In Goa, one person in every family to be given first responder training||PANAJI: The Goa government has launched a new initiative in which one member of every family in the state would be trained by the directorate of health services (DHS) to respond to emergencies. This first responder training aims to equip a member of the family with the skills to administer first aid to the patient. The one-day programme, designed by GVK EMRI, is targeted at strengthening the chain of survival in society, and according to the DHS, is the first of its kind in the country. “This initiative has been taken to educate one member of each family from a village or taluka to attend and provide first aid to his/her family and the surrounding community,” said GVK EMRI deputy manager Shrinivas Deshpande. He said the idea of training people to respond to medical emergencies was floated by health minister Vishwajit Rane. The first responder, he said, is the first person at the scene to recognise the emergency, activate an emergency medical service system, and provide lifesaving first aid with minimal equipment until the emergency medical service providers arrive. “First responder training is the first and vital link to a good emergency response system for any society,” he said. The participants will be trained in scene safety, personal protection—wearing a mask, gloves and goggles—and how to activate an emergency response system. “This programme equips the participants with essential preliminary care skills like giving rescue breaths, chest compressions, and first aid for medical, trauma, and environmental emergencies,” Deshpande said. The community first responder training will be implemented for the convenience of people during the pandemic keeping in mind social distancing. “If a family member is aware of first aid, a visit to the hospital can be avoided and lives can be saved with timely and prompt first aid medical assistance,” he said. Batches of 50 in five different talukas—where there is no immediate access to a health facility—will be picked for Phase-1 of this training. “The training of the first batch at Valpoi was completed on Monday, and training for other batches will soon be held at Usgao, Sanguem, Canacona and Sanquelim,” Deshpande said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-goa-one-person-in-every-family-to-be-given-first-responder-training/articleshow/81609696.cms||Bindiya Chari
---||Jammu||21 yers after Chittisinghpura killings, kin of slain Sikhs look for answers||AMRITSAR: For more than 21 years now, the Sikhs of Chittisinghpura in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) Union territory are searching for answers to the massacre of 35 young and elderly Sikhs who were shot dead in cold blood on March 20, 2000. “The moot question is, who attacked us and why the government has failed to give us any satisfactory reply and has been making false promises of conducting an inquiry into the the incident,” said the lone survivor of the carnage, Nanak Singh while talking to TOI on Saturday. Nanak had lost his son, brother, and three cousins in the blood bath. Nanak still remembers how the masked gunmen had dragged the Sikh men out of their homes and made them stand in two queues before killing them on March 20, 2020, a day before the visit of the then US president Bill Clinton to India. Nanak himself had sustained injuries and survived after treatment at various places, including Amritsar. In the memory of their slain near and dear ones, the Sikhs of J&K have begun akhand path both at Jammu and Chittisinghpura, the bhog of which would be performed on Sunday. Nanak said till date government has failed to pinpoint the terrorist group that had attacked. “There appears to be a big game plan behind the incident. That’s why both the Congress as well as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) governments did not show any sincerity in conducting an inquiry and fixing responsibility of the incident on any group,” he alleged. Babu Singh who also lost his relatives in the incident said a few days after the Chittisinghpura massacre, the government claimed to have gunned down a group of terrorists at Kuthar area, near Chittisinghpura, but upon inquiry, it turned out to be a false claim. He said the government had put up a permanent post of Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) in the area but that was not an answer to their grievances. A Sikh leader from Jammu, Surinder Singh said “We have urged the Modi government to open an inquiry and expose the faces behind the gory attack.” “There are still over 400 Sikh families in Chittisinghpura. We have not forgotten the incident as it has left an indelible mark in our memory. And we need our answers,” Nanak added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jammu/21-yrs-after-chittisinghpura-killings-kin-of-slain-sikhs-look-for-answers/articleshow/81614705.cms||Yudhvir Rana
---||Chennai||Old-timers, young people giveUdhayanidhi warm welcome||P Ranganathan stood at a vantage point on Nainiappan Street, behind Congress headquarters Sathyamurthy Bhavan, waiting to catch a glimpse of DMK candidate Udhayanidhi Stalin. "I am here to see Stalin’s paiyan (son)," said the octogenarian enthusiastically. His connection with the Dravidian party is more than 50 years old. "When Chittibabu was the Mayor (of the erstwhile Madras Corporation), they allotted a house for my family and several other families in the vicinity. We have remained loyal to the party since," said Ranganathan. Loudspeakers installed on either sides of the narrow street belted out the party’s song - "Stalin thaan vararu". Udhayanidhi canvassed for votes with folded hands, often waving to women and children who stood in balconies. The area is dominated by Muslims. Udhayanidhi, earlier, called on Prince of Arcot Nawab Mohammed Abdul Ali at the latter’s residence and sought his support. The campaign vehicle made an unplanned entry into a narrow lane from Subbaraya Mudali Street, leaving the police on bandobast duty puzzled. Two women, one of them holding up the Congress flag, broke away from the campaign trail. "I will get `200 at the end of the trail. It will help me buy medicines," said Kannagi. A group of boys aged between 12 and 15 years distributed the DMK’s manifesto pamphlets to passersby and locals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/old-timers-young-people-giveudhayanidhi-warm-welcome/articleshow/81609713.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||AAP interfering in Sikh religious affairs: SAD||Chandigarh: Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) said the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) was following the footsteps of the Congress party by directly interfering in the religious affairs of the Sikh community by trying to prevent the SAD from contesting the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) elections. It also announced that it would initiate criminal action against the polling agency which had conspired with AAP to come up with a “bogus survey” for the 2022 assembly elections. Former minister Dr Daljit Singh Cheema claimed that AAP Delhi government had become “desperate” and joined hands with “anti-panthic” groups to prevent SAD from contesting the forthcoming DSGMC elections. He said the level of frustration was such that Delhi’s Gurdwara election minister Rajinder Pal Gautam had written to the principal secretary, gurdwara election department to demand strict compliance of certain amended rules which had been brought into being by the erstwhile Congress government. “These rules seek to prevent allocation of the symbol reserved for the SAD despite the fact that the issue was settled by the Election Commission of India in 2008.” Claiming that this was done because AAP was afraid that the SAD would sweep DSGMC elections, Dr Cheema said the ‘sangat’ was with the party because of the ‘langar sewa’ it had done during the period of Covid, creation of a hospital for free dialysis treatment and legal help offered to Sikh youth who had been targeted for repression by both the BJP-led central government and the AAP government. “I want to tell Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal that others also tried to interfere in the religious affairs of the Sikhs but did not succeed. Nor will you,” he claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/aap-interfering-in-sikh-religious-affairs-sad/articleshow/81609170.cms||---

---||Goa||80% vote in civic polls, leaveparties, candidates guessing||PANAJI: The over 80% voter turnout in the elections to seven urban local bodies, including the lone municipal corporation, on Saturday seems to have left the candidates and political parties guessing on who will form the councils. Although every panel and even independent candidates are claiming victory, even as silent voters hold the key, all speculations will be put to rest after the counting of votes on Monday. Undeterred by the increase in Covid-19 cases, voters came out in large numbers and even the elderly were brought to the polling booth on wheelchairs. In most booths, the mandatory safety norms for coronavirus were followed. This is the second election during the ongoing pandemic. The first was the zilla panchayat (ZP) election held in December last year, which had recorded 57% polling. Voting was held for seven urban local bodies, including Bicholim, Pernem, Valpoi, Cuncolim, Curchorem, Canacona and Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP), which are all represented by the BJP MLAs. The results of these urban local bodies will indicate whether there is resentment against the sitting MLAs or they still have the upper hand in municipal areas. Pernem recorded highest turnout of 91%, while the CCP was lowest with 70.33%. The byelection for a ward in Sakhali Municipal Council recorded 87.67% voter turnout. The turnout was comparatively low for the Navelim ZP bypoll, which registered only 57.52% polling. Officials said that 83.8% voting was recorded in the byelection for 18 wards of various village panchayats. Even as polling went on peacefully with no untoward incident, Panaji police arrested two persons for violating the model code of conduct. A political observer said that although there were no major issues in the municipal election and no strong opposition, it would still be interesting to witness the outcome as it will be an important precursor to the assembly elections which are scheduled to be held early next year. “If the BJP-backed panels lose the municipal elections, then the party has to once again go back to the drawing board to plan its strategy in municipal areas for the assembly polls,” another political observer said. “Even though BJP won the ZP polls with a thumping majority, the municipal polls are also equally important for the party as there was no major opposition in this election,” he said, while adding that MLAs as well as the opposition had worked hard to ensure that their candidates came out victorious. All eyes are on the CCP results as the Panaji MLA and Taleigao strongman Atanasio ‘Babush’ Monserrate had vowed to secure all 30 seats and rule the corporation. This is the first time that Monserrate is not facing a direct challenge from the BJP in CCP elections since as he has come into BJP fold. Monserrate has taken the opportunity of CCP elections to launch his son Rohit into politics, even as the BJP had earlier criticised the Congress for ‘family raj’ politics. A political observer said that if Monserrate does not manage to secure all 30 wards, then it would mean that there is a strong resentment against the Panaji MLA within just two years of him getting elected to the prestigious capital city seat, which was earlier under the iron grip of former defence minister and chief minister Manohar Parrikar. Monserrate said that he will be responsible if he loses the CCP elections, as the party has given him the opportunity to lead the panel from the front. Similarly, the MLAs representing the six towns, some of whom are ministers, have worked hard using all the resources available to them, in their attempt to prove their popularity. The results will be keenly awaited as the major political parties will have to go for corrective measures if they don’t do well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/80-vote-in-civic-polls-leaveparties-candidates-guessing/articleshow/81609709.cms||Murari Shetye

According to the auditor, the fraud is to the tune of Rs1.22 crore. An FIR was filed by manager Ranjit Giri at Arni police station where offence was registered under sections 406, 409, 420, 467, 468, 469, 471, 477 and 34 of IPC against the then branch manager Yogita Pusnayake (Yavatmal), accountant Amol Mujmule (Jawala), cashier Vijay Gavai (Yavatmal) and contract clerk Ankit Mirase (Sukali).

---||Surat||Disappearing travellers fresh challenge for health teams||Surat: If the health authorities aren’t already hassled with asymptomatic cases, it’s the issue of disappearing travellers coming from outside the state giving them the nightmares. Patients are being dropped by bus operators ahead of the testing booth at the city’s entry point and these people reach the city in other private vehicles. Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) teams caught 1,855 such patients between 1 am and 5 am on Saturday and after testing 34 were found positive of the virus. These people were coming to the city from Maharashtra but alighted outside the city limits from the private transport buses. According to health officials, a large number of positive people are coming from Maharashtra. SMC has already issued a guideline of seven-day compulsory quarantine period for people entering the city from outside. It is suspected that crafty bus operators are adopting the escape route to help such patients avoid the testing at entry points and also bypass the compulsory quarantine rule. “Within a matter of four hours, these many people were found dropped outside the city limit before the checkpoint and of them 34 tested positive. We have formed four teams that will keep watch on patients being dropped outside the city. They will trace them and test them,” city municipal commissioner Banchhanidhi Pani told TOI. SMC officials fear that the number of passengers being dropped before the checkpoint could be much higher. After getting down from the buses, these passengers either catch a rickshaw or take lift in trucks. In the last 19 days, health teams found a total of 247 persons who have come to the city from outside positive of the virus. These persons were tested at entry points Kadodara (63), Palsana (66), airport (45), Jahangirpura (24), Sayan (23) and railway station (9). On Saturday itself, a total of 17 travellers from outside the city were found positive at the city bus station. Meanwhile, to keep a check on the spread of the virus in the city SMC has formed a task force that will identify super-spreaders in different areas. Health teams have started taking actions in places where crowding is noticed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/disappearing-travellers-fresh-challenge-for-health-teams/articleshow/81609177.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta
---||Chandigarh||Body of Una Hindu man to be exhumed in Saudi Arabia||Shimla: The consulate general of India office at Jeddah has taken up the matter of exhuming the body of Una resident Sanjeev Sharma, who was buried in Saudi Arabia as per Muslim customs, despite him being a Hindu. It has now come to light that mistake was committed due to translation error in death certificate. Once body is exhumed it would be repatriated to India. Himachal Pradesh chief minister Jai Ram Thakur had requested foreign minister S Jaishankar on Wednesday to intervene in the matter. He had sought that mortal remains of Sharma, who was a resident of Mohalla Gurusar ward No 2 of Una district, be brought from Saudi Arabia so that his last rites could be performed as per the Hindu traditions. Sharma was working as a truck driver with Saleem Abdullah Saad AL Saqr in Saudi Arabia since 1999 and had died in Besh Hospital in Jizan region of Jaddah on January 24. His family got in touch with the Indian Embassy so that his body could be brought back to India. However, on February 18, the owner of the company where Sharma used to work informed the bereaved family that they had buried Sharma in a graveyard. He forwarded a copy of the death certificate and burial permit which erroneously mentioned the religion of Sanjeev Kumar as Muslim. The CM had informed the state assembly on Saturday that after receiving the information about the incident he took up the matter with the Government of India and Saudi Arabia consulate general. He said Indian consulate general at Jeddah through email informed him that issue has been taken up with the local foreign office to exhume the body and to instruct local authorities to probe the circumstances leading to burial of the body without any intimation even to his sponsor. The email said the religion mentioned in the English translation of Arabic death certificate issued by Khamees Mushayat civil affairs office as “Muslim” was a mistake made by translation office while in original death certificate, the religion of the deceased was not mentioned. An apology letter has been issued by the Saudi translation office. Sharma’s issue was first raised in the Himachal Pradesh assembly on Tuesday by Congress MLA Satpal Singh Raizada .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/body-of-una-hindu-man-to-be-exhumed-in-saudi-arabia/articleshow/81609169.cms||---

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Famous but friendly, Teacher is a study in principled politics||Kannur: Frequent television appearances during the Covid fight have ensured that beyond being the health minister of Kerala, Shailaja Teacher is a celebrity in her new constituency, Mattannur. People of all ages, even school kids, thronged to take selfies with her, while many, especially women came “just to see her in person”. Her campaign managers are aware of the importance of selfies and so every meeting is followed by a scramble when selfie requests from as many as possible are accommodated. Although she stays in Mattannur and has taught here for long, she contested the last elections from Kuthuparambu. Wearing a well- starched cream ikkat cotton sari with dark blue border and blue woven motifs, she effortlessly posed for selfies and made small talk with the people as she toured her constituency on Saturday. With the sari pallu pleated and neatly pinned up in her trademark style and her well-oiled hair held back with a flat clip, she conveys the perfect “not-a-hair-out-of-place” image even in the sweltering heat and crush of crowds milling around her. Drumming up excitement at most meetings were enthusiastic chenda melam artistes as fire crackers created a festive ambience. Red garlands were present everywhere and professional photographers captured the moment. At every meeting, Shailaja Teacher referred to the Centre’s Citizenship Bill and the “attempts of the BJP to divide the country along communal lines”. “Our CM was the first to state that it will not be implemented in Kerala before a few other CMs also spoke up against the bill,” said Shailaja teacher adding that no one had the right to decide who will be a citizen. “Keralam oru urukku kota pole nilkkum” (Kerala will stand like an iron fort) against communalism under Pinarayi Vijayan, said Shailaja Teacher, adding that people should have the right to follow different Gods, choose whatever food they want to eat. “To ensure these rights are protected, you need to vote for the Left,” she said. In every speech she enumerated the achievements of the LDF government especially in implementing the social development agenda reminding the people that social welfare pension increased from Rs 600 to Rs 1,600 under the LDF and that its manifesto promises to further enhance it in stages to Rs 2,500. She also repeatedly brought up the promise of pension for housewives in the LDF manifesto. “We have a society where if you ask a housewife what do you do, she would respond saying “nothing”. What that means is that they feel that they do not do anything that is paid. That will change,” she promised. Along with her campaign managers and media team, teacher’s husband, Bhaskaran Master, followed her cavalcade in a separate car and was present at every meeting keeping an eye on all the arrangements. Having lived in Mattannur and taught there, she has several ‘proud’ students in the constituency who take pride in the fact that they knew her personally. “I was her student and she has been an inspiration for so many of us,” said Renjini, who has been an anganwadi worker for 23 years. She talked of how all of them worked so hard to ensure services reached people even during lockdown. It’s not difficult to see why the moniker “teacher” has stuck to her.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/famous-but-friendly-teacher-is-a-study-in-principled-politics/articleshow/81609181.cms||---

Health authorities have also said it was high time for people to follow protocol such as wearing masks, avoiding crowded places, maintaining social distancing and washing hands frequently. According to police department, 3.7 lakh challans have been issued for not wearing masks and more than 14,000 vendors were challaned for selling products without wearing masks. Overall 11.7 lakh challans have been issued for violation of Rajasthan Epidemic Act. Police said they would ensure that people wore masks to prevent spread of the virus. While cases are on the rise, the health department was resorting on the‘tried and tested’ strategy of ‘test, track and treat’ under which it is carrying contact tracing of minimum of 20 persons per positive case (in the first 72 hours) along with isolation and early treatment of serious cases as per clinical protocol. It is also focusing on surveillance to detect cluster of cases and focus on clinical management in districts reporting higher deaths. Moreover, surveillance at public places has also been intensified.

---||Pune||Extra manpower to ramp up contact tracing in PMC limits||Pune: The civic body has decided to rope in around 1,000 PMPML staffers and teachers from the education department as additional manpower for Covid-19 mitigation work. The maximum staffers would be involved in ramping up the contact tracing. The rest would be engaged in monitoring patients in home isolation, managing the war rooms and coordination, data feeding, management at Covid Care Centres and to help at vaccination and swab collection centres. Every civic ward would have around 20 to 25 teams for tracing high-low risk and close contacts of Covid patients. Authorities from the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) said they had started deploying additional manpower from other departments on the Covid front following the spurt in daily cases. “We are expecting to rope in around 500 PMPML (Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited) staffers and similar number of teachers, on priority. The talks with the departments concerned have been initiated. By next week, we shall be deploying the staffers as per the requirements,” a civic official said. The contact tracing teams are reaching out to at least 20 contacts of positive patients. “We have asked the teams to identify maximum contacts of a patient. For this, the patients should furnish exact details, which will help trace the contacts at the earliest,” Sanjeev Wavre, the PMC’s assistant medical chief, said. Sambhaji Khot, an officer attached to the Sinhagad Road ward office, said, “Teams are visiting patients’ homes to seek more details to trace the contacts and identify suspected patients. We are expecting more manpower from next week .” Sources from the PMC said in addition to containment measures, the administration would have to engage the staff in vaccination-related works.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/extra-manpower-to-ramp-up-contact-tracing-in-pmc-limits/articleshow/81608655.cms||Sarang Dastane

State party president Ashwani Sharma described the chief minister’s style of governance as “feudal and anti-people.” The Congress government in the state wreaked havoc on the socio-political environment, it is a dark period for the state, the BJP president alleged. “The recently held municipal elections were a farce as the entire state machinery was marshalled to make the Congress win. However, this is no victory as people were held to ransom in fear and democracy was muffled,” Sharma alleged. Holding back to back meetings of various organisation cells, Punjab organising secretary Dushant Gautum, Rajya Sabha member and national spokesman Narinder Singh, who is also the co-organising secretary of the state, said “Mission Fateh” in 2022 would be done by the BJP and Punjabis would vote for peace, prosperity and progress.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cong-will-be-routed-in-assembly-polls-bjp/articleshow/81609173.cms||---

Since a lot of areas in several districts are remote, the MMUs play a key role in providing healthcare services at the doorsteps. “The MMUs have outpatient clinic with examination table, light and sufficient facilities for basic lab investigations and medicine,” said a health department official. The highest number of MMUs are in Tamil Nadu which are 415, followed by Rajasthan (214) and Uttar Pradesh (170).

---||Delhi||Delhi: Green move that turns out pocket-friendly too||NEW DELHI: For Chhatarpur resident Shashi Kiran Singh Puri, travelling nearly 100km each day from Delhi to Ballabhgarh and back cost him almost Rs 27,000 each month in fuel. With his vehicle almost at the end of its life, the doctor made a conscious decision to opt for not only an environment-friendly car, but one that would reduce his commuting expenses. The electric car he bought requires five hours of charging once every three-four days and allows him to drive around 350km before he has to plug in the charger again. With Delhi government pushing the use of electric vehicles (EVs), many others like Puri now consider such cars genuine transport options. Confident after two months of purchasing the MG ZS, Puri drove all the way to Kandaghat in Himachal Pradesh on Thursday. “Charging hasn’t been a problem so far,” the 70-year-old said. “For my trip to Kandaghat, after travelling 270km, we halted at Panchkula and had snacks while our car got charged at the showroom. All showrooms have turbo chargers that can recharge your car fully in 45 minutes.” The retired wing commander and medical superintendent of a Ballabhgarh hospital added, “An EV is not only ecofriendly, but also financially prudent. I no longer spend Rs 800-900 per day in fuel.” Puri usually recharges his car after reaching home in the evening and by midnight, it is done. “The auto-cut off feature automatically stops the electricity when the battery is fully charged,” he said, adding that he has not yet felt the need to use a charging station in the city. Businessman Suninder Sandha also owns two EVs, having purchased his first, the MG ZS in March last year, after reading about it on the internet and getting feedback from relatives in the US and the UK. “After I got my first EV, I stopped using my other cars for daily purposes,” said Sandha who logs over 1,000km every month. Happy and satisfied with it, Sandha bought another green number plate car, the Mercedes Benz EQC, in January. “In comparison to fuel-based cars, driving an EV is comfortable and convenient due to its lighter weight. I don’t feel tired when I drive these vehicles,” testified Sandha. The GK resident charges his cars at home for six hours each, either together or separately as necessary. Vinod Pillai doesn’t need to charge the EV he bought last September more than once a week. When he drove it to Pune, he stopped six times on the way. “It took us two days to cover the distance of almost 1,500km,” revealed the Delhi Cantonment dweller. “I did not have to worry about recharging the battery because we simply halted at an MG or Tata showroom on the way for that.” The two companies have an MoU to set up fast chargers and allow the consumer of either brand to walk in and juice up their car. Pillai said that being a Delhiite, he wanted to do his bit to fight air pollution. He drives his car only around 35km a day. “On a full charge, it can go around for 350km, good enough to last me a whole week. I use my Saturdays or Sundays to recharge the battery,” said Pillai, for whom the higher upfront cost of the EV is more than made up by the better long-term economics. “People forget there are subsidies, lower interest rates on loans and some exemptions while purchasing an EV. The tax too lower,” he smiled. Vikas Sharma also recently replaced his 13-year-old petrol vehicle with an electric one after comparing the costs with diesel and petrol models. “My experience has been great so far,” said the happy Mayur Vihar resident. “I incur a cost of Rs 1-1.10 per 10km compared with Rs 8-9 in my petrol vehicle. The money saved on fuel is helping me pay off the bank loan.” Sharma travels around 60km every day and finds the EV a great option. “With more charging points cropping up around the city, I can only expect a better scenario in years to come,” he said. Sharma suggested that the government extend the subsidy to vehicles costing below Rs 15 lakh to make their purchase more attractive. EV prices start at around Rs 10 lakh, with SUVs costing upwards of Rs 15 lakh. Even electric scooters users are elated with their decisions. Sharad Soni smiles when he talks of his two-years old Xero+. “It has become a centre of attraction and people on the road ask me about my experience of using a green vehicle,” Soni said. “I have a daily run of around 20km and have never faced any inconvenience.” He has since decided to buy two more electric scooters — for his daughter and daughter-in-law.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/green-move-that-turns-out-pocket-friendly-too/articleshow/81609717.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Incomes of some top leaders’ wives rose exponentially in last five years||Thiruvananthapuram: P A Muhammad Riyas, who is contesting on the CPM ticket from Beypore, is among the candidates who has remained below the income tax slab for the last five fiscals. However, the total income of his wife Veena T, daughter of chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, has more than tripled in the same period. Similarly, S Jyothi, wife of senior Congress leader K Muraleedharan, is a homemaker and her income ballooned from Rs 12.78 lakh in 2015-16 to Rs 5.39 crore in 2019-20. As for P V Anwar, the independent Left-supported candidate in Nilambur, his income plummeted by 93% in five fiscals, according to disclosures submitted by candidates in the affidavits for assembly polls. The income disclosures of candidates and their spouses reveal a picture of affluent homemakers and their tax-free candidate spouses, several of them subject to dizzying highs and lows in five years. Veena T had a total income of Rs 8.25 lakh in 2016-17 as per the tax returns' statement. By 2020-21, the total income increased to Rs 29.9 lakh, marking a 262% rise. Her income which was Rs 10.4 lakh in 2017-18 more than doubled by next year to Rs 29.68 lakh and further increased in 2018-19 to Rs 30.72 lakh. This fiscal, there was a slight dip of Rs 78,323 in the total income. Her source of money is income from IT consultancy; as per the affidavit. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan's income remained in the base tax slab in the past five years while the income of his wife Kamala T dipped from Rs 2.9 lakhs in 2017-18 to Rs 16,400 in 2020-21. S Jyothi, wife of K Muraleedharan, who is locked in an intense three-cornered contest in Nemom, saw her income leapfrog from Rs 24.5 lakh to Rs 5.39 crore in a year (2018-19 to 2019-20). K Muraleedharan, on the other hand, has maintained an income of Rs 34 lakh except in 2018-19 when he suffered capital loss of around 5 lakh. Jyothi's income comes from rent, dividends, bank interest and agricultural revenue. P V Anwar, the Nilambur MLA who is contesting for another term, had grappled with losses in the last five years, going by the returns statement. He had a total income of Rs 59.37 lakh in 2015-16 and by 2019-20 it shrank to Rs 3.98 lakh, recording a loss of more than half a crore. He has a liability of Rs 5.4 crore, though his self-attained assets have an approximate market value of Rs 34.38 crore. Jose K Mani, who is contesting from Pala saw his income drop by 19% in five years; in the meantime, his wife Nisha John increased her income. Nisha John, employed as a HR consultant, sourced income from perks, bank interest and dividend from shares, the affidavit shows. She has an investment of Rs 2.2 crore as shares in 24 companies. Oommen Chandy had an income of Rs 3.42 lakh in 2014-15 and since then his income has been below the tax slab. BJP state president K Surendran also had an income in the base tax slab in five years -- ranging between Rs 2.3 - 2.5 lakh. Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala's income dropped by 32% in five years while his wife's income increased by Rs 9.42 lakh. Salary from a private insurance brokerage firm is the source of income of his wife. Suresh Gopi, BJP candidate in Thrissur, is arguably the highest income grosser among the candidates. His income was Rs 3.2 crore in 2019-20.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/incomes-of-some-top-leaders-wives-rose-exponentially-in-last-five-years/articleshow/81604527.cms||Aswin J Kumar
---||Goa||Airfares to Goa soar ahead of long weekend with Holi||PANAJI: Even as India faces an unprecedented spike in Covid cases, airfares to Goa have begun shooting up ahead of the long Holi weekend. For instance, air tickets from Pune to Goa will cost thrice their usual price on Saturday. The normal price is Rs 3,200, but for March 27, it’s Rs 9,500. With Holi on a Monday (March 29), the weekend starting from March 27 will prove ideal for a short break for travelers. Flight tickets from Hyderabad are already more than twice the normal fare. While the regular fare is around Rs 3,500, the fare closer to Holi already costs nearly Rs 8,500. Similarly, the Chennai to Goa fare, usually around Rs 3,600, is now over Rs 7,000. For travelers from Kolkata looking to plan a last-minute weekend break in Goa, airfares have already gone up to Rs 9,200, up from the usual Rs 5,900. A similar hike in air ticket costs are being witnessed on the New Delhi-Goa route, with prices at Rs 7,600, far above the normal Rs 4,400. Also, once the festivities over the long weekend end, travelers from Pune will have to shell out Rs 6,000 as of now to return home, which is double the regular fare on the route. The airfare to return to Bengaluru on March 29 or 30 will cost over Rs 5,000, which is Rs 2,000 more than the regular fare. But other than Pune and Bengaluru, fares to return to other major cities in the country post the Holi weekend have not yet shot up, and are only showing a marginal rise as of now. As the week progresses, airfares are expected to soar further as has been the trend for flight tickets ahead of long weekends.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/airfares-to-goa-soar-ahead-of-long-weekend-with-holi/articleshow/81609733.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

---||India||Ashoka row: Over 150 international academics support Mehta||NEW DELHI: Over 150 international academics came out in support of Pratap Bhanu Mehta on Friday, days after he resigned from Ashoka University, citing the management’s insecurities over his criticism of the government. The letter described his resignation as a “dangerous attack” on academic freedom. Former RBI governor and economist Raghuram Rajan also expressed solidarity with Mehta in a blog posted on his LinkedIn profile. “Mehta is a thorn in the side of the establishment,” he wrote. The open letter was addressed to the trustees, administration and faculty of Ashoka. Among those who signed the letter were Canadian philosopher Charles Taylor, professor of philosophy and law Kwame Appiah (New York University), Yale English professor David Bromwich, social scientist Partha Chatterjee (Columbia University), Oxford history professor Faisal Devji, Lawrence Lessig (Harvard Law School), philosopher Martha C Nussbaum (University of Chicago) and Harvard humanities professor Homi K Bhabha. “We write in solidarity with Pratap Bhanu Mehta, and to reaffirm the importance of the values that he has always practiced. In political life, these are free arguments, tolerance, and a democratic spirit of equal citizenship. In the university, they are free inquiry, candor, and a rigorous distinction between the demands of intellectual honesty and the pressure of politicians, funders, or ideological animus. These values come under assault whenever a scholar is punished for the content of public speech. When that speech is in defense of precisely these values, the assault is especially shameful,” the letter said. “The university must be a home for fearless inquiry and criticism. We support Pratap Bhanu Mehta in his practice of the highest values of intellectual inquiry and public life,” the letter further said. Mehta’s exit was followed by another high-profile resignation, when former chief economic advisor Arvind Subramanian quit as faculty, also in solidarity with Mehta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ashoka-row-over-150-international-academics-support-mehta/articleshow/81611180.cms||---

The three men are also alleged to have robbed a truck driver in Aya Nagar a short time later. The crimes were reported within half an hour of each other. The arrested have been identified as Yogesh, 26, who runs a buildings material supply business, and his associates Baljeet, 30, and Naveen Lohmod, 25, all residents of Aya Nagar in south Delhi. A woman called the cops on phone at 3.38am on Friday to report being molested by the men in a Scorpio car. A police team rushed to the crime spot and met the survivor, who told the cops that the men in the Scorpio had picked a fight with her brother who had gone there to pick up some relatives in Fatehpur Beri. The woman told police that when she intervened, the accused misbehaved with both of them and then sexually assaulted her. The same morning at 4.06am, police received a call from Aya Nagar from a truck driver accusing three men in a Scorpio of robbing him. Shahjad, a 30-year-old resident of Meerut, UP, claimed that he and his labourers were unloading bricks from their truck in Aya Nagar when three men approached them in a white Scorpio car and relieved him of his wallet containing Rs 30,000 and other valuables. Atul Thakur, DCP (South), said the initial reports had the accused in both the cases using the same Scorpio bearing the registration number DL12 CM 5869. “We registered a case of gangrape on the woman’s complaint and a case of robbery on the complaint of the truck driver. Police teams were alerted about the Scorpio and CCTV footage from the area checked,” said Thakur. “The car was finally spotted parked in G Block of Aya Nagar area. It was recovered and inspected by a forensics team.” The police officer said that by Friday evening, the investigating teams had received information that the three suspects were hiding in the forest area behind G Block. “Our team raided the area and all the three accused were arrested. We also recovered Rs 5,200 of the cash robbed from the truck driver,” said Thakur. “The truck driver’s purse containing his Aadhaar card, driving licence and ATM card was also retrieved from a vacant plot in Bakhtawar Chowk in Aya Nagar.” (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/woman-trying-to-save-brother-molested-in-south-delhi-3-held/articleshow/81609745.cms||---

LDF, UDF race to dole out promises||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Both the LDF and UDF are competing with each other to woo voters with sops and welfare schemes but experts are concerned over the “Tamil Nadu model” of parties unveiling populist manifestos that will add a significant burden on the exchequer. Hike in welfare pensions, introduction of pension to homemakers and free food kit distribution feature in the manifestos of both the fronts. While LDF promises to increase welfare pension to Rs 2,500 (from the present Rs 1,600) the UDF manifesto offers to hike it to Rs 3,000. “The government spends Rs 950 crore on welfare pensions. It will go up to around Rs 1,500 crore if LDF keeps its promise,” an official with the state finance department said. The Tamil Nadu government had earmarked Rs 6,000 crore for providing food subsidies during 2019-20. In the same year, it set aside Rs 1,985 crore for giving a Pongal gift of Rs 1,000 to each family. As much as Rs 726 crore was allotted for various marriage assistance projects during the period. “It is desirable for the governments to propose welfare schemes. But, it should first look at ways to increase revenue,” said Mary George, economist. “Steps must be taken to boost revenues from non-tax sources as well. Take the case of the land holdings leased out to various agencies and corporates---the government hasn’t increased their rates, which is Rs 146 per hectare, fixed way back in 1960,” she said. “The government started free food kit supply during the lockdown. Such measures paid off in the local body elections. It has become a vicious circle, no party can backtrack now,” said D Dhanuraj, director, Centre Public Policy Research (CPPR). “If welfare projects are announced, measures to increase revenue must also be chalked out, otherwise, the state may head to a financial anarchy,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/parties-race-to-dole-out-promises/articleshow/81609200.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

As per official norms, recovery rate is calculated by considering total number of discharged patients with total number of admitted patients as denominator. At present, eight districts of Marathwada have collectively recorded 19,600 active cases of Covid-19 as against only 1,990 cases by January 1. Aurangabad district, which currently has logged highest 8,569 active cases of Covid-19 in the region, has lowest 84.20% recovery rate, followed by Nanded (84.40%), Jalna (88.04%), Beed (88.48%), Hingoli (89.65%), Parbhani (89.75), Latur (91.24%) and Osmanabad (93.34%). Nanded district collector Vipin Itankar said that the mortality among recent Covid-19 cases has come down. “The recovery rate is bound to go up as fresh cases are being reported in bulk. We were reporting average 25 cases per day during February, but now daily average of 600 citizens are getting infected with Covid-19. However,our death rate has come down to 0.44% this year despite spike in Covid cases,”said Itankar, a MBBS graduate, adding that the majority of patients were asymptomatic in nature and can be cured with home-isolation. Notably, Aurangabad divisional commissioner Sunil Kendrekar recently held a division-level review meeting during which he asked district administrations to ensure availability of sufficient number of beds in view of record rise in fresh Covid-19 cases across Marathwada. As per revamped health set-up, Aurangabad district now has a total of 115 healthcare facilities available for Covid treatment, including 11,763 isolation beds, 2,124 oxygen support beds and 532 ICU beds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/recovery-rate-nosedives-amid-record-rise-in-active-cases-in-marathwada/articleshow/81607730.cms||Prasad Joshi

The nod from Nepal’s drug regulator came after the drug advisory committee of Nepal’s department of drug administration met on Friday and gave its okay for a conditional EUA, according to reports from Nepal. Bharat Biotech is believed to have applied for EUA in Nepal in the second week of January, but the approval came over the weekend after the company declared that Covaxin showed an interim efficacy of around 81%. India’s drug regulator too drop the clinical trial mode tag for the whole virion, inactivated virus vaccine after Bharat Biotech and ICMR-NIV revealed the interim efficacy data in the first week of March. With this, Covaxin becomes the third Covid-19 vaccine to be approved for emergency use in Nepal after AstraZeneca-Oxford’s Covishield, made by Pune-based Serum Institute of India, and the one made by China’s Sinopharm. While Zimbabwe gave its approval to the vaccine earlier this month, Brazil has sealed a deal with Bharat Biotech for the supply of 20 million doses of Covaxin. Nations like Ukraine and France too are in parleys with the company for procuring supplies of the desi vaccine. Over the weekend, 2 lakh doses of the vaccine were delivered to Mauritius, under India’s ‘Vaccine Maitri’ programme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covaxin-gets-emergency-approval-in-nepal/articleshow/81609723.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

Victims are getting abusive calls and their names are being maligned among friends on social media and family contacts, accessed after agents got access when the victim downloads the app and granted permission. In January, Telangana police arrested a Chinese, HE Jian alias Mark (26), from Jiangxi, from Thane. A Mumbai man ended his life due to harassment by agents. Maharashtra cyber cell Twitter handle receives at least four complaints a week from victims. Last year on November 27, TV serial writer Abhishek Makwana (37) died by suicide allegedly following harassment by loan sharks of the apps. Makwana’s family has been receiving threats after his death to repay a “loan”. Charkop police registered an FIR. Makwana’s brother Jenis said, “The agents are harassing and threatening his family and friends for repayment.” Cyber expert Ritesh Bhatia said he got text messages from an app that hacked into the contacts list of his client. Bhatia’s wife Nirali, a cyber-psychologist, got complaints from traumatized victims after they took small loans but are paying more than 100% and still are being abused. The app is used to blackmail victims even if loans are paid. Some people who did not take loans are getting threats to pay EMIs as their number is being taken from those who took a loan. “The client took a loan for his son’s blood transfusion. A cyber expert too received a text message maligning his client’s name who took Rs 1.8 lakh loan and ended up paying Rs 4 lakh, but still money is being demanded,” Bhatia said. A girl said she received a rape threat for one-day delay for a Rs5,000 loan. Around five lakh people have been scammed of more than Rs 15 crore since March 2020 end.

---||Kolkata||Seniors from all walks of life need to take part in vaccine drive: Doctors||KOLKATA: Vaccination centres across public and private hospitals have seen an overwhelming response from senior citizens, most of them hailing from the informed section of society are well-off. Those from lesser affluent backgrounds, however, are yet to come forward to take the Covid-19 vaccine even though it is being administered free of cost from government-run centres. “Around 75% of senior citizens and those above 45 with co-morbidities taking the shot in our hospital are those who otherwise would have sought medical care in a private hospital. We are seeing very few of those who otherwise prefer government hospital for treatment coming forward for the jab,” said vaccination co-ordinator of a state-run medical college. Even as there is no specific data on the socio-economical background of those being inoculated, those supervising and manning vaccination centres said it was quite evident from the profile of recipients lining up. “In the first few days, almost 100% of those who came to take the vaccine were from that informed population. But gradually, we are coming across a few recipients from the less privileged background,” said a source at another government hospital. Healthcare experts said concerns like digital registration, lack of information, the on-going election meetings/rallies where many from the particular section tend to take part could be some of the reasons for staying away from the vaccination programme. “Even people from the less privileged background are equally vulnerable to the infection. The government in its part should make an effort to drive this point to this section of society that they need to take the vaccine and that they will get it free of cost. They just have to go and register themselves on the spot,” said a senior doctor of a government hospital. All government vaccination centres now have a desk to facilitate spot registration of senior citizens. State director of health Ajay Chakraborty agreed that due to the awareness about the vaccine in media, the more informed people are taking the lead in taking the vaccine. “It is but obvious that the informed people will be the ones to come forward to take the vaccine. But even people from the lower-middle class background are now taking the vaccine and their number is picking up as well,” said Chakraborty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/seniors-from-all-walks-of-life-need-to-take-part-in-vax-drive-doctors/articleshow/81608691.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Carcasses of three dogs were found on Friday night while that of a pup was found on Saturday morning. The carcass of one dog was picked up by the civic body on Friday morning after the locals reported about it. Another dog that was suspected of being poisoned was taken to a veterinary hospital. Volunteers of NGO People for Animals, after receiving information of stray dogs being killed in the garden, rushed to the spot and informed police too. “We found three carcasses one of which was not properly buried because of which there was stench in the surrounding area. Another dog that was suspected of being poisoned was taken to hospital,” said Shikha Patel, board member of the NGO. Shikha added that one pup that was fit until the wee hours of Saturday was found dead on Saturday morning. “Due to the death of the pup which was fit until some hours back, we believe there is foul play,” she said. “We investigated and questioned the locals and regular visitors of the garden and all of them have pointed fingers at the security guard,” Patel said. Some walkers told her that in the past they had stopped the security guard from hitting the dogs. Based on a volunteer’s complaint an offence was registered against an unidentified person at Fatehgunj police station. “We are investigating and since there is no direct evidence against anyone the offence has been registered accordingly,” said a police official. On Thursday, Ejaz Sheikh, a resident of Machhipeeth had thrashed a stray dog and dragged it for 500m before leaving it in injured condition near ward 8 office. Sheikh was arrested on Friday after an animal rights activist approached the police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/five-stray-dogs-found-dead-in-vadodara-public-garden/articleshow/81609220.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad’s water warriors||World Water Day, March 22Store water; avoid taps Apart from limiting the usage of water for daily chores, I also ensure that the water draining out of the washing machine is diverted into percolation pits dug in front of my house. Recycling water – like watering plants with the same previously used to wash the rice, or clean the floor -- is another common practice in my household. I have also made arrangements to fill the rainwater, from rooftop, into a big vessel. Since we use stored water from a container, as opposed to running water from the tap, for brushing, cleaning utensils etc, it helps us to reduce the use of water, significantly.  V Nagendra Kumar, Alkapuri Colony Share with neighbours I recently installed a RO water purifier in my home and noticed that it wastes a lot of water in the process. With some research online, I found it could be used for plants. But since I have a very small garden in my balcony and water consumption from the RO has increased – with the onset of summer -- I reached to my neighbours asking them to take water from me, for their plants. So now, the water from my RO is being distributed to all my neighbours to water their plants and use for floor cleaning etc. I pitched the same idea to my club members who have now started an initiative around recycling water from the water purifiers. Syeda Afreen, Turkapally Fine those wasting water I stay in an apartment with eight flats where we have set up four water harvesting pits to direct every drop of rain water and storm water to recharge our groundwater. Now, taking a cue from the government initiative, of imposing fines on commercial enterprises discharging water on roads, we are debating the idea of imposing fines on colony residents discharging water on roads. With Holi round the corner, I request all to avoid wasting water and soak in the festivities with gulal and other natural colours.  Medha Singh, Kanchanbagh Recharge groundwater Until 2017, all 20 apartments in our complex were dependent on water tankers. But then we realised that it was not only an expensive affair but also led to excessive use of water, unnecessarily. So, we constructed a rainwater harvesting pit and since then, we’ve neither had any shortage of water nor have had to shell out big bucks to buy it. If that’s not all we’ve also laid a pipeline – connecting the pit on the terrace to the ground – to enhance the groundwater levels; and it has worked. An annual maintenance of the rainwater pit is done just before monsoon, following scientific procedure, and it not only helps us conserve water but assure no stagnation. In fact, given the success of our model, many apartment complexes in the area have now adopted a similar method to preserve water. Srinivasan Ramaswamy, New Bhoiguda Repair leakages immediately The most important thing that we follow at home, to arrest wastage, is to ensure that none of our taps and pipes are leaking. If there is an issue, it is immediately rectified. As far as our housing society is concerned, we have a rainwater harvesting pit to collect water and also maintain strict timings for water supply to every home, so as to ensure sufficient supply to all houses. It also arrests the overuse of water, which is very important given the crisis staring us in our faces. Parimala G Tadas, A S Rao Nagar Put storm water to better use As a group, we have implemented various measures at the Botanical Garden, spread over 200 acres (approx), to achieve water sustainability and flood mitigation in surrounding roads and colonies. Six abandoned borewells have been converted into rainwater harvesting recharge pits. So, whenever it rains these structures get replenished and can be used for extraction of groundwater. They also sustain other surrounding borewells. Further, we have managed to divert stormwater flowing from a nearby colony into a boating pond so that it does not flood municipal drains and lead to water overflow on the main roads. The impact: use of water tankers in the area has dropped drastically and boating activity is also helping with revenue generation. Subhash Reddy, GachibowliSay no to showers Aware of the need to conserve water on war-footing, my family and I have stopped using showers for bathing. We always use buckets; it saves hundreds of gallons of water. We are also very careful while using water to either wash utensils or clean the car. It is limited to one or two buckets. Cars, most often, can be dry cleaned as well. We can save lots of water if everyone adopts this practice rather than getting the car cleaned on a daily basis with running water from the pipes. Jitesh Mathur, Nallagandla Awareness rallies I have started collecting runoff rainwater from the streets by constructing and maintaining rainwater harvesting pits at low levels, within internal roads with my own money, since 2012. I have educated others too and as a result, the groundwater level in our area is 20 feet at present, whereas in our adjacent colonies it is much more. I am also conducting rallies with children during 'earth day' to teach them about important water concepts such as managing and protecting water resources. K Satya Prasad, TrimulgherryUse rainwater through the year We built our home in 1995, and have ever since been collecting rain water to store it in an underground reservoir of 1,25,000-liter capacity. In 2003, we connected our neighbour’s roof to our underground reservoir so now we collectively conserve over 2,50,000 liters of rain water and use it through the year. We use it for drinking, cooking, bathing and washing clothes. Two third of our annual water consumption comes from rain water and one third from municipal tap. Used water is directed to two soak pits to enrich the groundwater table. For drinking and cooking we use an ordinary water filter. Since the tank is closed and dark, algae do not form and there is no use of mosquitoes and cockroaches. It’s also helped us save a lot of money. M M Sharma, Sainikpuri Avoid using air-conditioners We have made many changes to our daily life, to minimise the use of water and conserve it instead. So, as opposed to buying packaged water for drinking, we boil regular water for our consumption. We never purchase or consume aerated drinks. We fetch water (municipal) once in two days and store it in steel containers etc. Also, to avoid the usage of air-conditioners, we keep water buckets in our bedroom to keep the room cool. Nagarjuna Y, MylargaddaWater bodies on campus I am a faculty member at the Institute of Management Technology, Hyderabad where we have set up seven water bodies on our 30-acre campus to conserve every drop of rain water and recharge our groundwater. The sewage and other waste water from academic blocks, student hostels, mess, canteen, and faculty housing, is stored and treated in the sewage treatment plant. The treated water is used to water plants and maintain a green campus. We have also installed water sensors in all the wash areas to save water. We have taken these measures also because we understand the role of education and awareness in water conservation.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata hospitals ready to reintroduce Covid beds to tackle case spike||KOLKATA: A steady trickle of Covid patients over the last one week, which has gained momentum in the wake of a spurt in transmission in some other states, has made private hospitals in Kolkata chalk out plans for a re-extension of its Covid units that had been drastically shrunk last December. At least two hospitals have started making provisions for an emergency expansion in case the existing flow of patients persists over the next few days. AMRI Hospitals, which now has a 50-bed Covid unit at Dhakuria, has kept arrangements ready to scale up the number of beds to 150 across its three units, including Salt Lake and Mukundapur. These two units had scrapped Covid wards in January. Four Covid patients have been admitted to AMRI since Friday, taking the total number to 18 – the highest in more than a month. “Even though not alarming, the current trend is worrying. So, we are prepared to reconvert some of the former Covid units if the numbers rise further. Our teams of doctors and support staff are ready for a spurt and we are better prepared for an emergency this time, having endured the pandemic situation for a year,” said AMRI CEO Rupak Barua. Peerless Hospital, which had 150 Covid beds till December, now has a 48-bed unit. Since last week, the number of patients has gone up from four to 22. Covid tests, too, have doubled over the last 10 days to touch 300. “We have seen 3-4 admissions a day since Thursday. This is significant and if the current rate of admission continues, we may have to re-convert some non-Covid beds. We are ready to do that since the Covid set-up has not been dismantled but merely set aside,” said Peerless CEO Sudipta Mitra. It is eerie, said Mitra, that the hospital had the same number of Covid beds and patients in April last year. “It suddenly exploded from there on till things came under control in December. Unfortunately, the numbers are rising again and political gatherings are contributing to it,” said Mitra. Charnock Hospital, which had to shut down in April last year after several of its healthworkers contracted Covid, is keeping a contingency plan ready to ramp up Covid beds. It now has just 10 beds and seven patients. “So far, we haven’t seen a spurt in number but it seems imminent,” said Charnock managing director Prashant Sharma. At RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS), the number of Covid patients has gone up marginally from 10 last week to 15 now. The hospital, which had 130 Covid beds till December, now has 40. “Since the number has not yet gone up significantly and the number of Covid beds still being adequate, there are no immediate plans to enhance capacity. But we are keeping a watch on the situation,” said Narayana Health zonal head R Venkatesh. Newly admitted Covid patients, though, have milder symptoms and the majority are being treated outside ICUs. “Just five of our Covid patients are at the ICU now and none is critical,” said Barua. At Peerless, too, most cases are mild so far. “The intensity of the virus seems to have ebbed,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hospitals-ready-to-reintroduce-covid-beds-to-tackle-case-spike/articleshow/81608683.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

Victims are getting abusive calls and their names are being maligned among friends on social media and family contacts, accessed after agents got access when the victim downloads the app and granted permission. In January, Telangana police arrested a Chinese, HE Jian alias Mark (26), from Jiangxi, from Thane. A Mumbai man ended his life due to harassment by agents. Maharashtra cyber cell Twitter handle receives at least four complaints a week from victims. Last year on November 27, TV serial writer Abhishek Makwana (37) died by suicide allegedly following harassment by loan sharks of the apps. Makwana’s family has been receiving threats after his death to repay a “loan”. Charkop police registered an FIR. Makwana’s brother Jenis said, “The agents are harassing and threatening his family and friends for repayment.” Cyber expert Ritesh Bhatia said he got text messages from an app that hacked into the contacts list of his client. Bhatia’s wife Nirali, a cyber-psychologist, got complaints from traumatized victims after they took small loans but are paying more than 100% and still are being abused. The app is used to blackmail victims even if loans are paid. Some people who did not take loans are getting threats to pay EMIs as their number is being taken from those who took a loan. “The client took a loan for his son’s blood transfusion. A cyber expert too received a text message maligning his client’s name who took Rs 1.8 lakh loan and ended up paying Rs 4 lakh, but still money is being demanded,” Bhatia said. A girl said she received a rape threat for one-day delay for a Rs5,000 loan. Around five lakh people have been scammed of more than Rs 15 crore since March 2020 end. Joint commissioner of police Yashasvi Yadav said the apps were unauthorised.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/mumbai-many-abused-by-chinese-apps-giving-quick-loans/articleshow/81612404.cms||Narayan Namboodiri

Earlier in the week, four persons — two airport staffers and two flyers — had been fined Rs 100 each for not wearing masks. This is sixth case this week when airlines have acted against Covid violators. So far, 10 have been booked, including four travelling by IndiGo, four by Alliance Air and two by AirAsia India.  The DGCA official in Kolkata has started conducting surprise checks in the terminal.As cases have dipped, passengers and a section of staffers has become lax. They are all reporting to work with masks but don’t wear them properly inside the terminal. We have to be more vigilant,” airport director Kaushik Bhattacharjee said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/flyer-without-mask-handed-over-to-cops/articleshow/81608699.cms||---
---||Pune||Blood plasma in short supply, just 114 units available in Pune division||PUNE: Availability of convalescent blood plasma has almost halved in Pune division due to significantly lower concentration of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in the blood sera of last year’s Covid patients. Suresh Patil, joint commissioner, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Pune division, told TOI, “Most blood plasma donors recovered from the infection six to seven months ago. They have very low antibody titers (concentration) in their blood. Higher titers of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies are believed to have better clinical outcomes than plasma with lower antibody titers. Patients who recovered from Covid infection recently are also showing lower antibody titers in their sera.” FDA data showed that all of Pune division, which includes five districts, has just 114 units of convalescent plasma currently as against 205 in December last year. FDA and blood banks said on an average, out of four to five donors, only one might have requisite levels of antibodies currently. Dr Smita Joshi, HOD, Blood Banks, Sahyadri Hospitals, said, “Many of the Covid patients of last year were positive for the infection in April, May and June 2020.The antibodies in the blood of most such patients are currently almost nil. The antibodies last for four months after the infection in most cases. The criteria for plasma donation is 28 days after Covid, maximum up to four months after the infection.” The spike in cases began from early February this year. The situation is likely to change with more donors expected during the next few days, said Joshi. “We have seen some increase in antibodies’ levels in the last three to four days in some donors so situation may improve,” she said. Sarika Patil, owner, Aadhar Blood Bank, said not only has it been difficult to find donors, but those who are coming have very low antibody titers. “We have phones ringing after every five minutes for convalescent plasma. Last year around September-October, we had many requests for blood plasma, but it was relatively easier to find donors then as compared now,” she said. Dr Kapil Zirpe, member of the Pune Covid-19 task force and head of the neurotrauma unit of Ruby Hall Clinic, said, “Trials conducted so far have not been able to prove the effectiveness of plasma therapy in severe cases. I personally do not prescribe plasma therapy for critical patients as it has been found to be ineffective & risky.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/blood-plasma-in-short-supply-just-114-units-available-in-pune-division/articleshow/81608698.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Pune||Pune-based rock band Blud gets behind the mic after 30 long years||PUNE: In the 90s, when Guns ‘N’ Roses, Pearl Jam and Nirvana ruled the rock music scene internationally. A group of city-based students founded the rock band Blud. Before the band members went their own way by the mid-90s, the group had won many awards becoming the most popular rock bands of Pune. Thurty-one years later, the band members are back with a new song titled Frail Children of Straw, highlighting the frailty of life during the Covid-19 pandemic. Mumbai-based band members Rahul Agarwal and Sanjeev Mahapure said that even distance and time did not dim the memories of Blud. “Blud was founded in 1989 in the basement of a friend’s under-construction house. While I used to play the guitars, Rajesh Bhatia was on the drums. Soon, the band attracted more members with Manoj Pandya as the lead guitarist, Rajeev Kurian doing vocals and Sanjeev on the bass. By 1993, Noshirwan Mistry joined on keyboards,” said Agarwal, now director of Kool-Ex Cold Chain Ltd. Mahapure, who has composed the song and is also with Kool-Ex, said, “In the shadow of the pandemic, the band decided to create a song that articulated the frailty of our times. The song, which has lyrics by Rajeev, has been recorded and shot across three continents, taking over six months to come into reality. For this project, Blud was joined by Nagpur-born Daniel Arlington, who now lives in Australia, as lead guitarist,” Mahapure said. Both Agarwal and Mahapure said they never expected the band to win awards. “We won Mood Indigo-Livewire and InSynch in 1991, Soundcheck in 1992, Woodstock in 1994 and RSJ Great Indian Rock in 1995. We met again in 2016 and did some gigs in Pune. Creating the new song was tough. Frail Children of Straw will stream on YouTube and other social media platforms,” Agarwal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/city-based-rock-band-blud-gets-behind-the-mic-after-30-long-years/articleshow/81608700.cms||Joy Sengupta

Teams will be placed at borders to check for the documents to ensure that vehicles meet the criteria for entering. The truck operators, meanwhile, claimed that they would face huge losses with this new restriction and have also written to the state transport minister regarding the same. “After March 31, commercial vehicles older than 15 years being run on diesel will not be allowed in Jaipur, Kota and Jodhpur. These vehicles’ category will not be allowed to be changed from next month. At present, this ban is for these cities and might get extended to others as well. Checking will be done at the borders to ensure that the restriction is followed. These vehicles will not be issued fitness certificates as well. This should greatly reduce the pollution level in these major cities and surrounding areas,” said an official of the transport department. There are over four lakh commercial vehicles in the state and the transporters have written to the state transport minister requesting for an extension of one year for this ban to be imposed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/transporters-fear-loss-due-to-ban-on-vehicles-over-15-years/articleshow/81609212.cms||---

A group of Delhi University students, who are members of a band named ‘The Particle Collective”, reached the protest site at Shahjahanpur and performed in support of the farmers’ agitation. In the letter to the Prime Minister, the farmers wrote, “Narendra Modi always speaks his mind, but never tries to listen to the common people of the country. The farmers of the country want to say to the Modi government that it should start listening to the farmers, labourers, youths and the unemployed of the country.” The farmers also said, “Else, very soon a day will come when such a revolution of change will occur that nobody will even talk about the BJP and the RSS.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/farmers-urge-pm-modi-to-listen-to-them/articleshow/81609223.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Semi-final to 2022 elections: BJP, Cong eye Salt by-poll||DEHRADUN: Though the outcome of the forthcoming by-election in Salt constituency won’t impact the power balance on a state-level, stakes are high for both the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as political pundits say that the result of the bypoll will set the tone for 2022 assembly elections. The death of BJP’s sitting MLA Surendra Singh Jeena — who won the constituency with a small margin of less than 3,000 votes in 2017 polls — has necessitated a by-poll in Salt. The constituency has been won by the Congress in 2002 and 2007 and by the BJP in 2012 and 2017. With locals of Almora miffed over the declaration of former CM Trivendra Singh Rawat to include the district in Gairsain Commissionerate, Congress sees a strong chance of making a comeback in Salt. Latching on to the opportunity, Congress leaders have even challenged chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat – who took oath on March 10 – to contest from Salt constituency. According to Congress insiders, block pramukh Vikram Singh Rawat, son of Ranjeet Rawat (two-time MLA from the seat), and Ganga Pancholi, who lost the last  by 2,904 votes are among the top contenders for the party ticket. However, the Congress may change its strategy and go with a heavyweight candidate if the BJP fields the CM as its nominee. Sharing the information, Congress state vice-president Suryakant Dhasmana told TOI, “A two-member team of observers – Deputy leader of Opposition Karan Mahra and Aarendra Sharma – have returned from Salt and submitted their report to the state leadership. After consulting the issue with the national leadership, the name of the party candidate would be announced.” He, however, did not fail to mention that the Congress may make some changes if the CM contests from Salt. “In the next few days, the name of our party candidate would be announced,” said the Congress member. The last date for nominations for the Salt seat is March 30 and the scrutiny of documents would be conducted on March 31. The last date for withdrawal of candidature is April 3. The polling would be conducted on April 17 and the counting of votes on May 2. Congress state in-charge Devender Yadav on Saturday challenged CM Rawat to contest from Salt. “If the CM believes that BJP has fulfilled its commitment made to the people of Uttarakhand, there should be no hesitation in contesting from Salt,” he said. To recall, Congress candidate Ranjeet Rawat won from the constituency in 2002 and in 2007 whereas in 2012 and in 2017, BJP’s Surendra Singh Jeena registered a victory.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/semi-final-to-2022-elections-bjp-cong-eye-salt-by-poll/articleshow/81608716.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot woos women, upper castes before byelections||JAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot has used the reply to the Budget discussion in the assembly to disarm the opposition and woo a cross section of people towards the ruling party keeping in mind the bypolls. The ruling party has a high stake in the ensuing polls as three of the four seats were held by Congress and one by BJP. Any advance by the BJP would be projected as the unpopularity of the Congress government and Gehlot. His announcement of economically weaker sections (EWS) to get the benefit of age relaxation and waiver of fees to apply in government jobs on a par with the other reserved classes was a masterstroke which nobody can find fault with. Though PM Narendra Modi introduced the EWS reservation, Gehlot stole the show by relaxing the eligibility of EWS reservation by hiking the income limit to Rs 8 lakh per annum and removing immovable assets from the purview of annual income. This made a sizable population of that section eligible for reservation and removed the role of babudom from assessing the income of EWS candidates. Gehlot also announced a ‘back to work’ scheme for women. He said women who were forced to leave their jobs due to marriage or some other reasons would be given a chance to come back to the job. He said 15,000 such women would be brought back to work in the next three years. This is a positive measure especially when working women have been at the receiving end during the economic slowdown and Covid-induced lockdown. The chief minister also tried to touch upon the Meena-Mina dispute with his announcement that both Mina and Meena are same and only a spelling mistake would be a relief to the powerful Meenas who enjoy ST reservation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cm-woos-women-upper-castes-before-byelections/articleshow/81609224.cms||---

Civic body officials said that the fire broke out due to gas leakage in a pipeline. It was doused by the fire department after constant sprinkling of water and foam liquid for over 30 minutes. The leakage was caused as the gas pipeline was punctured while laying underground cables for CCTV cameras under the Smart City project. With flames coming out of the road, nearby shop owners rushed out of their establishments. “We were shocked to see fire on the road, so we just ran out and called fire brigade,” said one of the shopkeepers. The fire department had to sprinkle water not only at the source of fire but also at the entrances and basement windows of the shops to avoid them from getting heated and catching fire. “There was no loss of life and property. But there is a possibility of damages due to salvaging activity,” a fireman said. The gas department had turned off the gas supply in the area after the fire was brought to their notice. The supply was resumed after three hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/fire-in-nagarwada-from-gas-leakage/articleshow/81609230.cms||---

He also demanded a probe by Central agencies or a court-monitored probe into the allegations. The BJP will hold demonstrations across the state on Sunday to press for the resignation. Meanwhile BJP leader Pravin Darekar tweeted: “One more minister is under a cloud. He will be in the net soon.” Fadnavis said, “The letter written by former Mumbai police commissioner Parambir Singh is not just sensational but shocking. This is for the first time in the history of Maharashtra that a DG rank officer has so openly written about the home minister. “Till such time doodh ka doodh, paani ka paani hota naahi (the truth does not come out), the home minister cannot continue in his post. The letter defames Mumbai police and is a shame for Maharashtra. The chief minister must take strong action,” said Fadnavis. “With the letter he has attached a WhatsApp/SMS chat. It says there is direct evidence about money being demanded. Under the circumstances, the home minister cannot continue in his post,” said Fadnavis. Fadnavis added if the letter had been brought to Thackeray’s notice earlier, he should have taken immediate action. “Perhaps to save his government or because he suspected his government may fall, he may have neglected it. Neglecting the letter is endangering the state,” he said. The demand for Deshmukh’s resignation was echoed by BJP leaders. Kirit Somaiya said it is clear why API Sachin Waze roamed with a note counting machine. MLA Ashish Shelar tweeted: “Gangwars of Maharashtra - Playing out in full. More secrets will tumble, Tiger (Shiv Sena) will crumble.” MNS chief Raj Thackeray tweeted that Deshmukh should resign. AAP questioned the timing of the letter, stating it comes after corruption charges against IPS officer Deven Bharati, and demanded sacking of both Deshmukh and Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-home-minister-must-resign-or-be-fired-fadnavis/articleshow/81609259.cms||---

The proposals will be tabled for approval in the executive committee meeting chaired by mayor Sanyukta Bhatia on Sunday. Thereafter, the financial statement will be placed for debate in LMC House later this month. According to LMC, the 2021-22 budget proposes total expenditure of Rs 1,932 crore, Rs 118 crore less as compared to 2020-21. The revenue has been estimated to be around Rs 1,937, about Rs 116 crore less than the current financial year that ends in March. Officials said the impact of the pandemic is expected to continue in 2021-22 which means that earnings will decline. The drop in revenue has been mainly because LMC could not auction its parking lots and low collection of property tax and rent due to restrictions. The civic body had set a target of Rs 410 crore property tax collection in 2020-21 but could collect only Rs 292 crore. Officers said since the income of many people dropped during the pandemic, they could not pay taxes. LMC gave relaxations on humanitarian grounds due to which projection for tax collection in 2021-22 has also been revised and pegged at Rs 300 crore, instead of Rs 410 crore. Other sources of revenue cited by LMC are municipal bonds (Rs 50 crore), pet registrations and penalty (Rs 6 crore), auction of parking lots (Rs 15 crore), user charges for facilities like garbage collection (Rs 36 crore), rent and sales of housing and commercial units (Rs 100 crore), funds under Swachh Bharat Mission and AMRUT (Rs 25 crore) and central government grant (Rs 26 crore). LMC also expects to get Rs 174 crore from the 15th finance commission. As a result, major cuts have been proposed. Among others, the Awasthapana Nidhi, used for miscellaneous development activities, has been drastically cut from from Rs 30 crore to just Rs 1 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/reeling-under-crisis-lmc-budget-to-cut-project-funds/articleshow/81609760.cms||Pranchal Srivastava

She pronounced this order after hearing a plea filed by Vaidya Aditya who challenged the attachment of his flat. The case of the ACB is that his father V Vara Prasad, an additional district judge from Rangareddy district, who was booked by them in a disproportionate assets case, discreetly funded his son to buy this flat. But the son, who is working in USA as a software engineer, furnished to the court the details of the flow of funds from his salary account in USA to the account of the builder in Hyderabad. The judge found that the action of the ACB in getting such a flat attached was unfair and ordered the immediate release of the flat. The ACB in its case said that additional district judge Vara Prasad acquired Rs 75 lakh worth of assets that are disproportional to his income. Later, ACB obtained permission from the state government and attached assets worth Rs 1.28 crore that are lying in the names of Prasad and his family members. This includes Aditya’s Kondapur flat. The judge felt that the authorities did not conduct a proper analysis of the assets of the kith and kin before attaching them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-sets-aside-attachment-order-on-kondapur-flat/articleshow/81609257.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

Thirty-seven pupils are from institutes in the city and 12 from Nagarkurnool. Of the 37 from the city, 34 students were from Government High School (GHS), Mudfort, Secunderabad. While about 150 students were attending physical classes every day, officials were yet to get all the students tested. Also, three students of GHS, Addagutta, also contracted the virus. “All the 34 students are staying in the hostel run by the tribal welfare department (ST Hostel for Boys, Bowenpally). After one of the students tested positive, they got the remaining boys tested as well. We were informed about the positive cases only after 3pm.

---||Lucknow||Confusion over comorbidity, certification behind low turnout||Lucknow: Lack of awareness, confusion over eligibility and complex certification procedure seems to be among the major factors responsible for low turnout in the 45-59 years age group with comorbidities for vaccination against Covid-19, a quick survey of TOI has found. The health authorities are inoculating senior citizens aged 60 years and above and people with comorbidities (45-59 years) in the phase III of the targeted mass vaccination drive. In 15 days of vaccination after the start of the campaign, the turnout of comorbid people has not been as encouraging as that of senior citizens. According to experts, people in the age group of 45-59 years are more mobile than the elderly, hence their turnout should be more. According to health authorities, of an estimated 1.1 lakh people with comorbidity in the district, about 12,000 have taken shots so far with an average of 800 people daily. In comparison, over 46,000 senior citizens out of around 5.5 lakh have taken the jabs with an average of over 3,000 daily. Many people with comorbidities told TOI that they are not aware what the word ‘comorbidity’ means. Many are aware about the eligibility but didn’t know from where to get a certificate. Also, the format of the certificate is in English, which many find hard to understand. Besides, a few complained that some private practitioners are refusing to sign the certificates. Ram Sanehi Devi (58), a sanitary worker who lives in Dubagga, who suffers from diabetes and hypertension for 10 years, said “comorbidity” was an alien term for her till last Friday when her neighbour told her about the process. She got a certificate from her doctor but officials rejected it saying to bring in the new format prescribed by health authorities. When she asked them where she could get the form, the staff told her to click a photo of the sample pasted on the wall outside the booth, get a print out, fill it and get a signature with the seal of her doctor on it. Raghu Prasad, (50), suffering from heart condition, took the photo of the format, asked his grandson to translate for him and get a printout before getting the signature of his doctor. “Two days got wasted due to this,” he rued. Ravi Mishra (46) of Chowk had a pacemaker implant in Delhi. After much difficulty, he got the form but the private practitioner refused to sign it saying that since the implant was done in Delhi, he could not certify it. Doctors said they were getting a lot of requests for certificates but could not sign it as they were not aware of the person’s medical history. Ex-president, Indian Medical Association, Lucknow, Dr PK Gupta said there were many who did not meet the criterion but wanted him to sign the certificate. Spokesman at the CMO office, Yogesh Raghuvanshi, said a door-to-door campaign to make people aware about vaccination and solve their queries has been started. “The form can be downloaded from www.mohfw.gov.in and is also available at centres,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/confusion-over-comorbidity-certification-behind-low-turnout/articleshow/81609780.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

In fact, former minister G Chinna Reddy who contested from HRM seat and ex-MLC Sabavath Ramulu Naik from WKN constituency never looked to pose any serious challenge to their rivals and their overall tally summed up the party’s poor show yet again.  Congress was banking heavily on anti-TRS vote but its failure to connect with the voters and impress them continued in this  too. Political analysts say that time has come for the party to rejig its strategies to connect with the people and win their trust. “People are not sure if Congress leaders will stay back in the party after being voted to victory. Congress needs to sort out the leadership issues first and galvanise the cadre,” an analyst said. Chinna Reddy, however, blamed it on money distribution by TRS and BJP for the party’s defeat. “This is my ninth election. The TRS and BJP have changed the election scenario making it impossible to contest without money,” he alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-congress-stares-down-the-barrel/articleshow/81609773.cms||Roushan Ali

---||Mumbai||Verifying unsigned mail from former Mumbai police commissioner: CMO||MUMBAI: The chief minister’s office issued a statement on Saturday saying it was verifying the unsigned mail from former Mumbai police commissioner Parambir Singh as his official email address is different from the one it was sent from. Singh’s official email address is parimbirs@hotmail.com while the mail on Saturday was received from paramirs#@gmail.com. The Shiv Sena has taken the view that since Deshmukh belongs to NCP, it is for party chief Sharad Pawar to decide on his dismissal. “Singh has made very serious allegations against the home minister. Singh will have to prove the allegations, which will be difficult. It is for Sharad Pawar to take a decision,’’ a senior Shiv Sena minister said. NCP spokesperson and skill development minister Nawab Malik, though, said Pawar and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray will together decide Deshmukh’s fate. “Deshmukh has accused the former Mumbai police commissioner of serious lapses in the bomb scare case near the Ambani residence while Singh has alleged that the home minister had asked Waze to mobilise Rs 100 crore per month. Under such circumstances, Pawar and Thackeray will discuss the entire episode and then take a decision,” said Malik. The NCP president had reportedly summoned Deshmukh to New Delhi on Friday to find out first-hand about the allegations. In mid-March, Thaekeray had invited senior IPS officials to discuss the bomb scare case. At the time, Singh had briefed Thackeray and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar about the alleged illegal activities of the home minister.  Congress general secretary Sachin Sawant has come to Deshmukh’s rescue. “Prima facie, it appears that the letter appears to be after thought after Singh was shunted out. Allegations of extortion by Singh were made by the BJP long ago,” he tweeted. “If the Sushant Singh Rajput case can be registered in Patna, then why can’t the Delkar case be registered in Mumbai. As per the Criminal Procedure Code, an offence is registered at the place of the crime,” he added. Sawant alleged a section of IPS officers was acting under pressure from BJP. “All SMS chats mentioned in Singh’s letter are in self-defence. It appears that a section of IPS officers is still acting under pressure from BJP. It is a conspiracy against the MVA government,’’ Sawant stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/cmo-verifying-unsigned-mail-from-former-cp/articleshow/81609279.cms||---

After a stunning victory over the ruling TRS in Dubbak by-poll just four months back followed by its emergence as a major political force in GHMC elections in December, BJP has failed to keep the momentum going. What hurt the saffron party most is the fact that it failed to retain its Hyderabad-Ranga Reddy-Mahbubnagar constituency, a seat won by its candidate N Ramchander Rao in 2015. Though Rao gave a tough fight to S Vani Devi of the TRS, he lost out to her in the counting of second preference votes. As if this was not enough, its candidate Premender Reddy finished a poor fourth and was eliminated in the counting of second preference vote in Nalgonda-Warangal-Khammam constituency. He managed to poll less than 50,000 first preference votes. An independent candidate Teenmar Mallanna polled nearly a lakh votes and Telangana Jana Samithi president M Kodadaram got over 89,000 votes in this constituency taking the second and third positions respectively with Palla Rajeshwar Reddy of the ruling TRS retaining the seat for second-term.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/defeat-a-blow-to-bjps-plans-for-2023/articleshow/81609790.cms||Roushan Ali

---||Mumbai||Ambani security scare: Explosives would’ve caused ‘low-intensity blast’||MUMBAI: The ministry of home affairs (MHA) has handed over probe into the murder case of Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran to the National Investigation Agency (NIA). The federal agency has taken over the probe from Maharashtra’s anti-terrorism squad (ATS). Hiran’s body was found in Mumbra creek on March 5. ATS is currently probing the murder case and is reportedly on the “verge of cracking it”. Meanwhile, the Kalina Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL), in its preliminary analysis, found the gelatin sticks recovered from Hiran’s Scorpio were capable of triggering only a low-intensity blast and there was little chance of them causing any big damage. An official said during the analysis, forensic experts found ammonium nitrate inside the gelatin sticks. Hiran’s name first came to light after his Scorpio, laden with 20 gelatin sticks, was found parked near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence, Antilia, on February 25. In the car, a threat letter was also found. The NIA had taken over the probe into the bomb car scare case from ATS two weeks ago and arrested city crime branch’s assistant police inspector Sachin Waze for his alleged role in it. FSL is also trying to find out if Hiran was drugged before he died. The ATS have procured Waze’s call records to show his location near Antilla Tower. The ATS officials said they interrogated Waze to know his locations on March 4 and 5 when Hiran went missing. There was a WhatsApp call between them on March 4. “Vimala Hiran (his wife) has handed us videos of Waze which will nail him. Waze had said he did not know Hiran but there is CCTV footage of five-star hotels where both are seen together,” said an official. The ATS has recorded the statements of two doctors of a Thane hospital after Hiran’s family alleged Waze had visited while his post-mortem was on.  The NIA, as part of recreating the scene, made Waze walk in a kurta-pyjama late on Friday and have almost identified him as the person seen walking near the Scorpio on February 26. An NIA team on Saturday visited Waze’s housing society in Saket, Thane, and recorded the security guards’ statements. A week prior to the incident (February 18 to 25), the Scorpio was allegedly parked in Waze’s society.  NIA on Saturday afternoon allowed Waze to meet his advocate Sajal Yadav for less than 20 minutes in the presence of the investigating officer. When contacted, Yadav confirmed he met Waze but declined to comment further.

The problem has been accentuated by the ongoing smart city work around Meenakshi Amman Temple with narrow stretches already reeling under traffic bottlenecks.Traders prefer this mode of transport as motorized vehicles have time restrictions during peak hours. There are an estimated 4,000 tricycles in the city transporting a variety of goods. Although they are found all over the city, they create traffic snarls in Masi streets, Marret streets, Kamaraj Salai and Obula Padithurai. There were around 10,000 tricycles till a few years ago but the numbers have come down after motorized vehicles took over. Commuters point out that slow-moving vehicles affect the overall traffic movement on key roads leaving them frustrated. They have urged various departments to come together to resolve the issue. P Vetrivel, a commuter from Munichalai, said, “Often, we cannot move even after the signal turns green when a tricycle is ahead of the queue. We have to cool our heels till another signal change comes,” he said. “Authorities should bring down the number of tricycles gradually as doing away with them overnight may not be possible. They should be encouraged to buy motorized vehicles. Give them incentive if they are reluctant,” said A Maniamuthan, a social activist. A trader on East Masi Street said tricycle pullers initially were loadmen who migrated from Ramanathapuram . They started pulling carts with wooden wheels before switching to tricycles. Thousands of families will lose their livelihood if they are wiped out of business, he said. A traffic police officer with the city police said the issue cannot be resolved unless the foodgrain market is shifted out of the city. “If they are forced to leave their work, they might take to crime. As in the case of fruit market which was shifted out, foodgrains market, onion market, garlic market and banana market should be shifted so that the issue will be addressed without affecting the livelihood of tricycle pullers,” he said. Apart from the police, Madurai district administration and city corporation should sit and chart plans to shift the markets, the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/tricycles-add-to-madurai-citys-vexed-traffic-woes/articleshow/81609801.cms||V Devanathan

We fed him rasogollas and sent some for his mother. We also carried a kurta-pyjama and asked him to wear them. We have received a lot of queries across the globe once his news got viral. We have asked everyone to contribute financially as they are very poor. We have provided his brother’s account and anyone can contribute in that,” said Ambarish Nag Biswas, secretary of West Bengal Radio Club (Amateur Club) whose members contacted Nepal Radio Club, which traced his family.

However, in reality, as per the study carried out by our students, out of the around 170 locations in Madurai, only around 50 locations did not have any sparrow population. So we need to help sparrows nest in urban areas by providing them a small space in buildings,” said Dr Priyatharshini Rajendran, assistant professor, Zoology, Lady Doak College.The expert highlighted that sparrows contribute towards maintaining ecological balance by eating worms and pests. She said according to their study, there is no credible link between the presence of sparrows and mobile phone tower radiation . Research scholars from Lady Doak College P Merlynna Esther Maxmellion and K Renukadevi, president of Iragukal Amritha Nature Trust N Raveendran spoke on conservation of house sparrows. Students and staff of postgraduate and research department of zoology, The American College distributed around 30 sparrow nest boxes which will help sparrows to nest in.

The timings for voting, which has been increased, will be from 7am to 7pm. However, the SEC is yet to take a decision on poll rallies. All social gatherings have already been banned in Solapur district. Officials said that Covid patients, people aged above 80 and the disabled will have to register their names by filing the 12D form with the tehsildar’s office.

---||Hyderabad||Habitat loss, diminishing resources lead to dwindling sparrow population||Hyderabad: The house sparrow is a bird most of us grew up with. However, slowly and surely, these birds have disappeared from the urban landscape, where they once used to thrive. This, experts say, has been an ongoing process since the 1990s due to habitat loss and diminishing ecological resources for sustenance. Factors like urbanisation, replacement of ventilators with air conditioners in houses, radiation from mobile towers, pollution, use of insecticides and pesticides in farms and emission of harmful gases are considered the main reasons that led to a drastic decline in the population of sparrows. Speaking to TOI, Pradeep Nair, founder of Animal Warriors Conservation Society said, “There is definitely a drastic decline in their population due to rapid urbanisation. For instance, they once used to build their nests in our ventilators and brick walls. To ensure that their numbers don’t die out completely, we have been distributing sparrow houses and water bowls to people for free.” In 2012, the Bombay Natural History Society had launched Citizen Sparrow, an online database targeted at recording the presence and absence of house sparrows across the country. The database, where birdwatchers and ornithologists regularly register the sightings, suggests that the population of house sparrows has declined considerably but with considerable efforts we can still take measures to revive the population of sparrows. Speaking on the occassion of World Sparrow Day, Nehru Zoological Park curator VVL Subhadra Devi laid emphasis on raising awareness among the people about the declining sparrow population. “To revive the sparrow population, I appeal to the entire staff, citizens, charities, conservationists, government to install sparrow houses and provide them with water.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/habitat-loss-diminishing-resources-lead-to-dwindling-sparrow-population/articleshow/81609333.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Faced pressure from Anil Deshmukh in Mohan Delkar suicide case: Paramjit Singh||MUMBAI: The letter bomb of former police commissioner Parambir Singh alleges home minister Anil Deshmukh exerted pressure on him in the suicide case of Dadra and Nagar Haveli MP Mohan Delkar. He said Deshmukh wanted an abetment of suicide case registered in Mumbai to derive political mileage from the case, although the suicide note made allegations against senior officials of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and it should have been registered in the union territory. “From day one, the Honourable Home Minister desired a case of abetment of suicide to be registered at Mumbai. My professional view after seeking appropriate legal advice was that while the suicide had occurred in Mumbai, all the alleged acts of abetment had taken place in Dadra & Nagar Haveli. Thus, the abetment of suicide, if any, was required to be investigated by the Police at Dadra & Nagar Haveli who would have jurisdiction in that regard,” said Singh in his letter. Singh said he had mentioned this in his briefing at chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s official residence Varsha. “After I drew the attention of all concerned about my view, there was general agreement that the alleged acts of abetment could only be investigated by the Police at Dadra & Nagar Haveli,” the letter said. He alleged Deshmukh insisted on registering the case in Mumbai. “Due to my resistance, the Home Minister was unhappy with me as the political mileage desired to be derived from the registration of the abetment of suicide case in Mumbai in the death of Shri Mohan Delkar against senior officials of Dadra & Nagar Haveli was not being achieved,” he added. The letter also said, “Despite being fully aware of the opinion of the legal experts, the general opinion and the reasons behind it, the Home Minister announced the setting up of a Special Investigation Team (SIT) and registration of an FIR into the alleged case of abetment of suicide of late Mohan Delkar on the floor of the Maharashtra Assembly on 9th March 2021.” In the assembly, Deshmukh had said Delkar had named Dadra and Nagar Haveli administrator Praful Khoda Patel in his note. Patel was with BJP and had served as minister of state for home in Gujarat when PM Modi was chief minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-faced-pressure-from-home-min-in-delkar-case-singh/articleshow/81609353.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

He also lodged a petition in this regard before returning officer Senthilarasan at Perur on Saturday and demanded the election officials not to accept the AIADMK candidate’s nomination. “The returning officer has, however, accepted the minister’s nomination despite the absence of these valid documents. We will move the court. The DMK legal wing will handle the issue legally.” In his petition, Sivasenathipathi said the sitting MLA of Thondamuthur (Velumani) had filed his nomination on March 18 by suppressing the source of his income and that of his family members. “It is a grave offence under the income-tax Act and will attract up to six years of imprisonment.” Accusing Velumani of amassing both movable and immovable assets in the name of family members, the DMK candidate said the offence, if proved, would attract another six years of imprisonment. “They have amassed wealth of Rs 78,96,000. It is a grave offence under the income-tax Act. Velumani’s nomination should have been rejected for failing to comply with the Supreme Court orders and the election commission’s instructions on suppression of assets in form 26,” Sivasenathipathi said. Addressing the media at the Perur taluk office, Sivasenathipathi said while the returning officer had received his complaint, the latter hadn’t failed to take any action. “We will bring the issue to the attention of Thondamuthur people.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/dmk-reject-velumanis-nomination-for-suppressing-income-asset-details/articleshow/81609352.cms||A Subburaj
---||Hyderabad||Congress, BJP need new game plans to beat TRS: Experts||HYDERABAD: With the pink party bagging both graduate MLC seats on Saturday, the Nagarjunasagar bypoll may be a do or die battle for BJP and Congress to stop the TRS juggernaut. Except for the setback in Dubbak bypoll and GHMC election, TRS has been on a roll, winning every election in the state and emerging as a force with no serious alternative to it in the state. Political analysts say now TRS would go to the hustings in the Nagarjunasagar bypoll claiming that BJP’s victory in Dubbak was like a flash in the pan and the saffron party’s claim of having emerged as an alternative to the ruling party has fizzled out. Many independents and contestants from smaller parties spoiled the show for BJP and Congress. For example, independent candidate Teenmar Mallanna had secured nearly a lakh first and second preference votes, followed by Telangana Jana Samithi president M Kodandaram polling over 89,000 votes in Nalgonda-Warangal-Khammam. BJP and Congress candidates finished fourth and fifth place respectively and were ultimately eliminated in second preference vote counting in this constituency. Even in the Hyderabad-Rangareddy-Mahbubnagar seat, two-term former MLC Prof K Nageshwar polled over 67,000 votes. Political observers said it has to be seen whether any of the independents, along with opposition parties, would try to put up an alliance candidate or go alone to take on TRS in Nagarjunasagar bypoll. They said both BJP and Congress need to come out with new strategies to beat the ruling party, which is seeking to retain the Nagarjunasagar assembly segment. The bypoll to Nagarjunasagar is on April 17 and counting of votes would happen on May 2.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cong-bjp-need-new-game-plans-to-beat-trs-experts/articleshow/81609856.cms||Roushan Ali

Shia Central Waqf Board, Waseem Rizvi, for his “controversial stand” on the Quran. The protesters, who had assembled under two separate umbrella organizations — All India Minority Welfare Front (AIMWF) and Tanzim Ahle Sunnat (TAS) – agitated outside mosques following their Friday prayers. “Rizvi has angered the Muslim community by filing a PIL in Supreme Court, seeking the removal of 26 Quranic verses from the holy book. He deserves severe punishment and we will not sit quietly until that happens,” AIMWF convenor (Jamshedpur) Babar Khan said. Rizvi had filed a PIL in the apex court on December 11 last year seeking the removal of some Quranic verses as he claimed that they promoted terrorism and jihad. The petitioner sought direction to ban Islamic clerics from teaching those 26 verses to Muslim children. “He (Rizvi) has done a great disservice to the community by insulting the Quran. His act is against Islamic beliefs,” TAS functionary Mufti Ziaul Mustafa said. Maulana Fariduddin Siwani, another TIA functionary, said those who attack or criticize the verses of Quran deserve to be boycotted by the Muslim community for a lifetime.

---||Lucknow||Need for inclusion of healthcare in school curriculum: Governor||LUCKNOW: Governor Anandiben Patel on Saturday said institutes of medical education should organise programmes where political leaders listen to the issues raised by students and experiences shared by doctors. This will help them formulate policies to benefit one and all. Speaking as chief guest during the foundation day of Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences (RMLIMS), the governor said she would want to become a part of a programme where students, teachers, doctors and non-teaching staff raise practical problems and offer suggestions to solve them. This was the first time in 10 years after its inception that the institute celebrated its foundation day. The governor felicitated 20 meritorious students of MBBS, MD, MCh and DM courses. The institute also adopted 20 children suffering from tuberculosis. “Medical educational institutes should make women aware of breast and cervical cancer. Special camps should be organised by students in rural areas where women can get themselves tested,” Patel said. She also suggested a child education unit in every ward dedicated to mother and child care in hospitals. Medical education minister Suresh Khanna instructed doctors to be more sensitive towards patients. “Acknowledgement from patients is bigger than any other achievement for a doctor,” he said. Presenting the annual report, RMLIMS director Prof AK Singh said the institute would soon start a neuroscience centre, robotic surgery and improve emergency services.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/need-for-inclusion-of-healthcarein-school-curriculum-governor/articleshow/81609854.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Are online classes necessary for students, teachers ask govt||Coimbatore: Teachers have welcomed the state government’s move to wind up regular classes for the students of classes IX, X and XI from Monday in view of rising number of Covid-19 cases. They, however, questioned the need to conduct online classes for the students since the government had already cancelled examinations. A government order that was issued on Saturday said the directorate of public health and preventive medicine had advised against continuing schools for classes IX to XI in the wake of rise in Covid-19 cases, while permitting schools to engage classes for Class XII as the number of students would be less. “Schools shall be closed for Classes IX to XI with effect from March 22 until further orders. However, online/digital mode of education shall continue for them. Hostels of the above students shall also be closed,” the government order said. T Arulanantham, state auditor, Tamil Nadu High and Higher Secondary Schools Graduate Teachers’ Association, said it was the right decision by the government, especially when the virus spread has started to increase again. He said the number of students attending schools after the government cancelled their examinations had already come down significantly. “When the students are reluctant to come to school, will they attend online classes? Most of the students attend the schools regularly only to score good marks in the examinations,” Arulanantham said. As most teachers have completed the syllabus, he said, they could use the online classes to clear the students’ doubts, if any. P Arunan, president, Tamil Nadu Government Employees and Teachers’ Welfare Federation, said now that the classes for other students have been cancelled, schools could use their complete resources to train Class XII students, who have to sit for public examination soon. “With more free classrooms, the number of students sitting in a classroom could be reduced further and teachers could pay more attention to them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/are-online-classes-necessary-for-students-teachers-ask-govt/articleshow/81609366.cms||Nivedha Selvam

After receiving fresh stocks from the state government on Friday evening, the vaccination drive restarted at all these centres on Saturday, said Bapusaheb Nagargoje, the medical superintendent of the NMC. Nagargoje told TOI that they have received 15,000 doses, which will last the next three days. However, the NMC will continue to seek more doses. P B Gandal, the deputy director of health, Nashik division, said they received a total of 97,700 doses for the entire division — comprising Nashik, Dhule, Jalgaon, Ahmednagar and Nandurbar districts — on Friday. Of these, 34,580 were dispatched to the 11 cold chain points (CCP) across the Nashik district, including 15,000 to the CCP of the NMC. On Friday, there was a shortage of vaccines at 23 of the 27 civic body-run centres in the city. Gandal said at times, there is a rush at particular centres while other centres do not many people. Therefore, the stock was exhausted in the centres that saw a rush. Health departments across the region should start inoculating with Covaxin shots. Until now, only Covishield vaccine was being administered at some centres. Gandal said they are keeping a strict check on the inoculation process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-civic-body-restarts-vaccination-at-its-23-centres/articleshow/81607860.cms||Santosh Sonawane

---||Hyderabad||Warming in Arctic region triggering heatwaves in India: Study||HYDERABAD: International and Indian researchers have decoded the secret behind the severe April-May heatwave conditions in India and linked it to the warming in the Arctic region. Any increase in the temperature due to global warming has an impact on the Arctic warming, which in turn results in heatwaves in India, including Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. While heatwaves elsewhere in the world are often linked to global warming, particularly Arctic warming, this is the first time that scientists have linked them to heatwaves occurring in India during April and May. “There is a rising trend of heatwaves in recent decades,” the study said, adding that heatwaves in India are for the first time linked to Arctic warming which in turn is a result of global warming. Indeed, several authors have shown that heatwaves in India are increasing, but a possible cause is global warming. “There is an urgent need to plan mitigation of this very adverse climate change. Indian heatwaves can be predicted about four days in advance prior to their occurrence,” the study said. Mechanism developed to predict heatwaves four days in advanceA team of researchers from the Centre for Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Science, University of Hyderabad (UoH), National Institute for Space Research, Brazil, Centre for Climate Change and Sustainability, Azim Premji University, Bengaluru, Department of Meteorology and Oceanography, Andhra University (AU), and Atmospheric Science Research Laboratory, SRM Institute, Chennai, used various calculations involving temperature and wind to arrive at the conclusion that any drastic changes in the temperature in Arctic region or northern hemisphere would directly have a bearing on temperature rise over India during April and May. The result of the study was published in the British journal, Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society. The research team was led by Dr V Brahmananda Rao of INPE, Brazil and included Govardhan Dandu from UoH. It said that in the Arctic region, temperature is increasing over twice as fast as the global average. Arctic warming is a result of global warming. This arctic warming reduces normal equator to pole temperature gradient. This is because while the equator is hot, the Arctic region is normally very cold. This change results in an increase in surface temperature causing heatwaves. Warming in Arctic region is highest in autumn, around 2.8°C. Arctic warming in recent years seems to cause extreme weather events in several places in northern hemisphere. Researchers have developed a mechanism by which heatwaves in India can be predicted four days in advance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/study-warming-in-arctic-region-triggering-heatwaves-in-india/articleshow/81609883.cms||Syed Akbar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai police’s image dented: Ex-top cops||MUMBAI: Former Mumbai police commissioner M N Singh on Saturday reacted sharply to former Mumbai CP Parambir Singh’s letter, saying issues raised by him are serious and have brought the entire police force into disrepute. Former IPS officers said despite the fact that the MVA government is guided by veteran politician Sharad Pawar, it appears to be on a sticky wicket. “It is a serious matter. From the contents of the letter, it appears that our police personnel have become robbers and extortionists in uniform. More shocking is the fact that the home minister and the police commissioner are trading charges against each other. As a result, the image of Mumbai police has been tarnished. I am saddened, considering that I was once the leader of Mumbai police,’’ M N Singh told TOI. M N Singh said, prima facie, it appears that Parambir Singh’s letter appears to be a fallout of comments made by home minister Anil Deshmukh, who had observed that the Mumbai CP made serious lapses while probing the Antilia explosives case. “Parambir Singh’s image was affected by the HM’s statement and, as a result, he has retaliated,’’ M N Singh said. A former DG said the government was facing the predicament since it did not take the charges made by Parambir Singh seriously. “As per Singh’s own information, he briefed not only the CM but also Ajit Pawar and Sharad Pawar. No action was taken on his information though,” he said. A former Mumbai police commissioner said this is the first instance of a direct confrontation between the home minister and a police commissioner. “We feel that the CM is giving a long rope to the erring IAS and IPS officials and his own cabinet members,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-polices-image-dented-ex-top-cops/articleshow/81609368.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

Kumar alleged the trio was found to be involved in doubling the weight of a farmer's sugarcane on the paper in collusion with him. Kumar said Guddu, a farmer hailing from Ujhainia Rampura village under Jahanabad police station, had brought 60 quintals of sugarcane — the estimated weight of the produce was noted down at the mill’s gate upon arrival — to the mill. However, the farmer’s tractor-trolley was issued a weighing receipt — checked at the exit gate — of 120 quintals, said Kumar. When the clerks — Akash, Satyam and Mahesh Pal — were questioned about the matter, they confessed to have manipulated the sugarcane weight in nexus with the farmer, alleged Kumar. Barkhera police station SHO Viresh Kumar said the clerks and the farmer were booked under section 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing the delivery of property) of the IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/three-clerks-employed-at-sugar-mill-farmer-booked-for-forgery/articleshow/81607423.cms||Keshav Agarwal
---||Kolkata||Marcos drill on Hooghly to celebrate Swarnim Vijay Varsh||Kolkata: The Indian Navy’s Marine Commandos (Marcos), based out of Visakhapatnam, carried out a drill on the River Hooghly close to Babughat on Saturday. This force continues to be an enigma even 34 years after its raising, more so, in places like Kolkata that don’t have a seafront where these elite commandos carry out drills occasionally. No wonder, people gathered to watch this unique display. Just after 4 pm, the Navy’s Sea King helicopters (also a rare sight in Kolkata) flew across Rabindra Setu to the north and approached Babughat. They lost altitude all the while till they hovered at a point where the Marcos slithered out to waiting Geminis (inflatable rubber dinghies with outboard motors). People watched in awe as a Gemini then sped towards the ‘beach’ next to Babughat that needed to be ‘taken over’ under the cover of dense orange smoke. “The predecessors of the Marcos were the demolition and clearance divers. While clearance divers created a path for ships by removing obstacles like mines and nets, those involved with demolition fitted explosives to the hulls of enemy ships. The ‘frogmen’ of the Royal Navy performed yeomen service during World War II. Apart from their diving skills, these frogmen had to be imparted survival training to enable them to get back home through enemy territory. Today, the Marcos are highly trained to carry out all kinds of operations,” a senior Navy official said. Saturday’s event was organised as part of the Swarnim Vijay Varsh celebrations. This year, India is celebrating 50 years of the Indo-Pak war of 1971 that led to the the Independence of Bangladesh. The Victory Flame, lit from the National War Memorial, is presently touring this part of the country before moving to Bangladesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/marcos-drill-on-hooghly-to-celebrate-swarnim-vijay-varsh/articleshow/81608870.cms||Jayanta Gupta

---||Mumbai||Stakeholders are split over Maharashtra measures||MUMBAI: Stakeholders for SSC and HSC exams are divided over measures announced by state education department on Saturday. A parents’ association plans to move court against a government decision to hold offline exams as Covid-19 cases are rising in the state. Forum for Fairness in Education president Jayant Jain said, “The time isn’t right. In a city like Mumbai, if over three lakh students travel for exams, it will lead to crowds in public transport and put them at risk too. The government must think of an alternative in case cases increase.” Over 33 lakh students in the state appear for the exams each year. In Mumbai, many students study in junior colleges away from home. Mumbai Principals’ Association welcomed the move. “With schools being used as exam centres, many will not have to travel a long distance. Students will feel comfortable on their premises, reducing anxiety,” said Prashant Redij, principal and association member. Another teacher, Rajesh Pandya, said it would lead to malpractices. “All schools would want their students to pass and score well. This could lead to cheating,” he said. A teacher also said the new format would add lot of work and delay results. “If assignments are submitted after board exams, it will clash with assessment schedules as teachers will be same. It will also be time for June exams by then, and soon re-exams,” said the teacher. “It was important to ensure the assessment pattern had to be flexible keeping in mind students had learnt online,” said Francis Joseph, parent of an HSC student.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/stakeholders-are-split-over-state-measures-in-mumbai/articleshow/81609380.cms||Vinamrata Borwankar

---||Lucknow||Dist court to hear plea for ASI survey on Monday||Varanasi: The Kashi Vishwanath Temple-Gyanvapi mosque dispute case came up for hearing on Saturday in the district court, which fixed March 22 as the next date for hearing. In December 2019, advocate Vijay Shankar Rastogi had filed an application on behalf of Swayambhu Jyotirlinga Bhagwan Vishweshwar in the court of civil judge requesting survey of the entire Gyanvapi compound by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). He had filed the petition as the ‘next friend’ of Swayambhu Jyotirlinga Bhagwan Vishweshwar. Later, in January 2020, Anjuman Intezamia Masjid Committee had filed an objection against the petition seeking survey of the entire Gyanvapi compound by ASI. The first petition was filed in Varanasi civil court in 1991 on behalf of Swayambhu Jyotirlinga Bhagwan Vishweshwar seeking permission for worship in Gyanvapi. The petitioner had contended that the Kashi Vishwanath Temple was built by Maharaja Vikramaditya about 2,050 years ago, but Mughal emperor Aurangzeb destroyed the temple in 1664 and used its remains to construct a mosque, which is known as Gyanvapi masjid, on a portion of the temple land. The petitioner had requested the court to issue directions for removal of the mosque from temple land and give back its possession to the temple trust. The petition contended that the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act was not applicable on the suit as the mosque was constructed over a partly demolished temple and many parts of the temple exist even today. In 1998, Anjuman Intezamia Masjid Committee moved the high court contending that the mandir-masjid dispute could not be adjudicated by a civil court as it was barred by the law. The high court stayed the proceedings in lower court which continued for the past 22 years. In February 2020, the petitioners approached the lower court again with a plea to resume the hearing as the HC had not extended the stay in past six months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/dist-court-to-hear-plea-for-asi-survey-on-monday/articleshow/81609886.cms||Binay Singh

While some of them are expecting bulk orders in the coming week, others, especially those in Tirupur, are a worried lot, as they have been losing many bulk orders with poll officials seizing the consignment and delaying the release. Jaikumar, owner of Gandhiji Khadhar store at Town Hall in the city, said they had started making face masks with the symbols of political parties about three months ago, as they were sure that the government would strictly implement the face mask etiquette during the campaign as part of Covid-19 precautionary measures.“We have produced nearly 50,000 masks so far. While there is a 30%-40% dip in the sale of t-shirts, shawls and badges with party symbols this time compared to the parliamentary election outing, there is a huge demand for masks,” he said.While Jaikumar’s store managed to sell only 15,000 face masks until the last week, the sale has now shot up by 50%. His brother Balakumar said, “As the campaign will become intense in the coming days, we are receiving bulk orders, which are likely to pour in for a while. We are in the process of producing another 50,000 face masks.”B Karthikeyan, a businessman from Tirupur, said there was a dip in the order after the announcement of election date. He attributed the dull business to seizure of goods by poll officials while transporting them for delivery. “It takes them at least two to three days to release the goods. By then, we would have missed the deadline for delivery and customers end up cancelling the order. I have lost orders for 25,000 face masks already.”Karthikeyan had been making face masks with party symbols since September. Explaining that the cost of a mask or t-shirt would be less when purchased in bulk, he said, “Poll officials often calculate the value at market rate, shooting the candidate’s election expenditures up. As it causes trouble for the candidates, they have stopped placing orders.”Unlike the previous elections, Karthikeyan said, this time the duration between the announcement of election date and the poll day was less. “This alone has affected the business by 30%.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/demand-soars-for-face-masks-with-symbols-of-political-parties/articleshow/81609369.cms||Nivedha Selvam

Returning officer of Mettupalayam constituency rejected the nomination of Makkal Neethi Maiyam candidate N Rajkumar for mentioning the party’s name in the space for recognized party, instead of registered unrecognized party. Unlike other candidates, he had not submitted multiple nomination papers. As the MNM had not nominated other candidates, it could not contest from the segment. Shortly after the announcement, the candidate, along with his supporters, had approached the returning officer, seeking an opportunity to contest from the segment, but in vain.

---||Mumbai||Covid funding hits other causes hard, NGOs struggle for funds||It’s rarely been more tempting to go cycling than in these pandemic times. Some pedal for recreation, some to stay fit and some to retain sanity in confinement. Come April, hundreds of cycling enthusiasts will pedal around their neighbourhoods for a nationwide virtual marathon called Cycle For Good. While fitness is key, compassion is at the heart of this act that could help fetch a kid in a village the smartphone he needs for remote schooling; give those battling HIV/AIDS another chance at life and prevent underage girls from being married off. The initiative comes at a time when non-profits in the country themselves are pushing through hard times. Given that donors — both individuals and corporates — have diverted their funds to Covid relief and the PM Cares fund while the Foreign Contribution Regulation Amendment (FCRA) bill in September imposed stiff conditions on bigger organizations and stopped their transfer of funds to smaller ones, many NGOs devoted to causes ranging from food and housing security to social justice and education, are shelving their on-ground projects. “During the eight-month lockdown, CSR funds to the tune of nearly Rs 12,000 crores were diverted to PM Cares fund. At a time when communities need their attention, many NGOs could resume with only one-tenth of their staff and operations. On top of that the new FCRA bill deprived thousands of NGOs of sub-grants,” said Nishit Kumar, founder-director of Centre for Social and Behaviour Change Communication that in association with YouTooCanRun, a tech-platform for endurance events is conducting ‘Cycle For Good’ as an alternative to traditional fundraising events. “The Mumbai Marathon would have raised around Rs 45 crores in charity but it did not happen this January," said Kumar hoping that this year-long alternative will help the 25 ailing NGOs on board. According to a study conducted by the Centre for Social Impact and Philanthropy (CSIP) that surveyed 50 non-profits across the country last June, roughly one-fifth of organizations said that they had to suspend their on-ground activities temporarily. “Those working on issues like migrant labour were able to successfully increase support. Others kept afloat by reaching communities through digital means. Many, whose domains are perceived as less critical such as arts and culture, sports and LGBTQ causes or lacked the means to adapt, had to shrink operations and cut staff," rued Ingrid Srinath, director of CSIP. Helpage India, in fact, could not carry out a single cataract surgery for senior citizens between March and June and had to close down their mobile healthcare units in Pune and Nagpur as comporates slashed donations, informed Prakash Borgaonkar who heads the NGO in Maharashtra and Goa. In the initial days of the pandemic, people and companies reallocated funds from regular programs to relief work. While the funds we raised were better than expected for our regular programs, we needed to reach out to more marginalized communities and children given their increased vulnerability. The need for investing in issues like malnutrition and protection against increasing child labour, trafficking and child marriage, has never been greater,” said Kreeanne Rabadi, regional director, Child Rights and You (West). The steep reduction in corporate support has hit cultural non-profits too. “The artist community is currently facing the threat of losing incomes and livelihoods across traditional and contemporary forms, in both rural and urban areas. Within this larger community of artistes, persons with disabilities who depend mostly on freelance work are further marginalized,” said Arundhati Ghosh, executive director of India Foundation for the Arts, a trust supporting practice and research in arts and culture. Among those that were able to adapt is Apnalaya that works with Mumbai’s urban poor. It raised Rs 6.46 crores and helped 2.3 lakh people living in the M East Ward. However, their annual budget had to be slashed by 13%. “There’s little money available for social development primarily due to business activities plummeting nationally. Many philanthropists and CSR entities are supporting projects that provide immediate relief but how will the loop from relief to recovery to resilience be completed without rights-based work?” asked Arun Kumar, CEO, Apnalaya. The impact is being felt the most by grassroots organisations that are usually community led. Praxis, an institute that promotes participatory practices among sanitation workers, homeless persons and migrant labourers among others, reached out to 82 organisations working in over 9000 villages across 13 states over the past year to find that 83% were in fear of survival after the next six months; 52 percent had applied for relief through various means; and 28% did not get any funds for relief work. Lalita Dhanwate from the Wadar denotified tribe in Maharashtra and founder of Vaijra Mahila Bahu Udeshiya Samajik Sangathan, highlighted the funding issues they faced with funding proposals mostly sought in English. "That's a big challenge and we received no funding in the lockdown. Being from the same community we cannot afford to personally contribute so we’re unsure of what the future holds,” she said. On the bright side, a recent collaboration between a workers’ think tank, tribal collective and human rights organisation has led to an initiative titled COLLECT (Community-Led Local Entitlements & Claims Tracker) where research fellows appointed across 100 Indian districts — typically from marginalized communities and organisations struggling to retain their projects following funding cuts — are collecting real time data for local advocacy and flow of information to authorities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/covid-funding-gives-ngos-a-run-for-their-money-in-mumbai/articleshow/81609910.cms||Mohua Das

He was pursuing religious studies from Sakya Centre, situated in the city’s Rajpur Road. The cause of the suicide is yet to be confirmed. Police officials said that they found the body hanging but no suicide note was found in the room. The body has been kept at the mortuary of the Coronation Hospital. “The monk was suffering from a mental illness and was also undergoing treatment. We have informed his family and they will reach Dehradun by Sunday. The cause of suicide is yet to ascertained. We will try to find out the cause by speaking to the bereaved family,” said Rakesh Sah, in-charge of the Rajpur police station. Notably, in October 2020, the Sakya Centre-run Sakya Academy, located in the Purkal area of Dehradun, was caught in the eye of a storm after some of its students from Nepal escaped the campus alleging that they were thrashed by a teacher. Later, one of the teachers of the academy had killed himself. In his suicide note, he stated that he is taking the extreme step because he felt responsible for the episode hogging media attention and the academy suffering disrepute.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/nepalese-monk-studying-in-doon-kills-self/articleshow/81608366.cms||Mohammad Anab
---||Lucknow||KVT-Gyanvapi land dispute suit: HC reserves verdict||Prayagraj: The Allahabad high court has reserved its judgment on a petition challenging maintainability of a civil suit pending before the Varanasi district court with respect to land title dispute in the Kashi Vishwanath-Gyanvapi Masjid case. Justice Prakash Padia on March 15 reserved judgment after hearing the petitioner, Anjuman Intazamia Masazid (mosque committee), Varanasi, and other respondents. The land title dispute relates to the Gyanvapi mosque, which was allegedly built on the ruins of Kashi Vishwanath Temple. According to the suit filed by the temple’s trust in 1991 in Varanasi district court, the temple was destroyed by Mughal emperor Aurangzeb in 1664 and the mosque was built using the remains of the temple. In the instant petition, Anjuman Intazamia Masazid, Varanasi has challenged the maintainability of the said suit taking the plea that Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991, bars filing of suit or any other legal proceedings with respect to conversion of religious character of any place of worship, existing on August 15, 1947. Hence, in this backdrop of the situation, it was argued on behalf of the petitioner that the impugned (under challenge) suit has been filed in contravention of the above provision and proceedings, therefore, it should be quashed on this ground alone. The petitioner has made reference to the Ayodhya-Babri Masjid case, where the apex court has observed, “Historical wrongs cannot be remedied by the people taking law in their own hands. In preserving the character of places of public worship, Parliament has mandated in no uncertain terms that history and its wrongs shall not be used as instruments to oppress the present and the future.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/kvt-gyanvapi-land-dispute-suit-hc-reserves-verdict/articleshow/81609898.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey

---||Coimbatore||103 fresh Covid cases, 1 death recorded in dist||Coimbatore: The district recorded 103 fresh Covid-19 cases on Saturday, taking the total number of cases past the 57,000-mark to 57,023. This is also the fourth day this week that the district recorded more than 100 fresh cases. With only 61 people getting discharged, the number of active cases crossed 600-mark to 635. The district recorded one death due to the virus, taking the toll to 686. The increasing number of active cases has prompted the city corporation to restart Covid care centres, opening the first at Gandhipuram. “We have opened one at Srinivasa Kalyana Mandapam, which can accommodate 70 to 80 beds,” city health officer Dr S Raja said. “If required, we will open another such centre next week,” he said. The civic body also set up five containment zones in the city on Saturday. With the district recording more than 520 cases in the first six days of the week, compared to hardly 300 cases in a week in February, health officers are alarmed at the increasing cases. “Maharashtra is now recording 25,000 to 26,000 cases a day, figures which were never seen in the first wave. The rate of increase in cases is extremely rapid,” a corporation health officer said. “The only sure-shot intervention at this point is mass vaccination. We need to get vaccinated faster than the rate at which the infection is spreading,” said Raja. Compared to the 6,000-odd vaccinations a day, 30,000 people should be vaccinated a day to become collectively immune. “Studies show that if 10% of the population is vaccinated, new cases will reduce by 50%. If 20% of the population gets vaccinated, it will further reduce by another 50%,” said the city health officer.

---||Bareilly||PTR’s proposal to get 5 jumbos from K’taka may finally take off||Pilibhit: A proposal to translocate five trained elephants from Karnataka to Pilibhit tiger reserve (PTR) to conduct patrolling and search and rescue operations of big cats lurking amid the sugarcane fields in the district may finally be implemented. The proposal was made by PTR authorities to the state forest department in 2018. However, the implementation of the plan was stalled due to lack of funds. Now, chief wildlife warden (CWLW) of UP, Pawan Kumar Sharma, has said the requisition of funds for transporting the jumbos will be included in departmental budget of 2021-22. Deployment of elephants is part of the exercise to avert possible man-tiger conflict arising due to tigers straying out of the forests. The issue of stray tigers has become more acute as those living in the agricultural belt of Amaria block have started venturing out to mark new territories in the cane belt. Forest personnel have their hands full while conducting operations on foot to locate and push the big cats back into the forest. This was evident when a tigress of the Amaria tiger stock was located at Harchuiya village in Lalaurikhera block, tranquillized and shifted to PTR earlier this month. Now, another one has been spotted at Jatipur village in the same block, 25 km from Amaria, home to some 12 tigers. “Jumbos play a vital role in locating and pushing the strays back into the wild,” said Sanjeev Kumar, DFO, forest and wildlife division. According to sources, initially a proposal to shift 10 jumbos from Karnataka to Pilibhit was made. Later, it was reduced to five jumbos. Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change and the chief wildlife warden of Karnataka have already approved the shifting of five elephants to Pilibhit. “Now, we have decided to include the funds in question in the departmental budget of the forthcoming financial year. We hope that the allocation may be possible by June this year,” said Sharma. Naveen Khandelwal, deputy director of PTR, said the transfer of jumbos from Karnataka would take four to five months even after the allocation of funds.“We have asked for Rs 50 lakh for the transportation of jumbos and their upkeep in PTR for an initial period of six month. We will require to send at least two mahouts, one fodder cutter and two veterinarians from PTR to Karnataka and stay there at our cost for at least one month to study the behaviour of jumbos, the conditions of their keeping, their diet and the environment soothing to them,” he said. After arrival, the elephants will take time to settle down and respond to commands in Hindi by the mahouts, Khandelwal added. “With the jumbos, we will be able to enforce our strategies for mitigating man-tiger conflict , carrying out intensive combing in the forests, especially in monsoon, when much of it is waterlogged,” Khandelwal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/ptrs-proposal-to-get-5-jumbos-from-ktaka-may-finally-take-off/articleshow/81607455.cms||Keshav Agarwal

On Saturday, he along with three others was commissioned in Indian railway protection force service as assistant security commissioner at Lucknow based Jagjivan Ram RPF Academy. Youngest among two siblings, Navin is known for his humble and helping nature. Back home in Chennai, he runs an NGO called ‘Truth’ and funds the education of marginalized children. After completing BE in mechanical engineering, Navin went to New Zealand and became a commercial pilot clocking 250 hours. His elder brother Arun Prasad is pilot of a chartered plane in Chennai. “With my job as pilot I was able to fund for the education of marginalized children. However, while visiting a cousin who is an IAS officer of Tamil Nadu cadre, I experienced that being a government officer there was more scope to help people. Therefore, I decided to compete in civil services exam and lead from the front to help those who are in need,” said Navin, who has also played lead actor in a Tamil movie ‘Kamban Kazhagam’, which was directed by Ashok Ranganathan, associate director of A R Murugadoss, the director of Tamil version of Ghajini. However, the movie was never released due to financial issues. Navin’s wife Manju told TOI, “He is a very humble person, always ready to help others. I’m proud of him.” Navin is first from his family to join the police force. Similarly, probationer Aditya (26) who hails from Rajasthan and was awarded Udai Shukla best probationer trophy and Saurav Kumar (30) from Jharkhand were first from their families to join the police force. Prior to joining IRPFS, Saurav was deputy manager of a leading automobile company. “I joined government service as an officer to understand and gain firsthand experience as to how the government system works, why things get delayed and why there is red-tape. I have seen my father Anil Kumar Singh struggling to get a simple work done in government offices,” said Saurav, who wishes to help those who are in need. Like him, Pawan Kumar (30) who was judged as best indoor probationer also hails from Jharkhand. The Dhanbad man was third in the family after his grandfather Balak Singh in Bihar police and father Ram Singh, a retired DSP from Jharakhand police, to join the force. “A uniform always inspired me to discipline and help others. I was working for a PSU Damodar Valley corporation as executive engineer, but at the back of my mind I knew I had to be a cop,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/these-officers-commissioned-to-irpfs-have-a-passion-to-help-others/articleshow/81609908.cms||Arvind Chauhan

The budget estimate for SPPU passed for the year 2021-22 is over Rs 540 crore. Vice-chancellor Nitin Karmalkar appealed to members to pass the budget proposal for technical reasons. The budget of the university needs to be passed before March 31 of every year. Karmalkar also promised the senate members that he would hold the meeting again within a month in an offline manner. During the offline meeting, various points in the budget, policy decisions and grievances of senate members will be discussed. Senate members raised issues related to examination and demanded the need to relook the allocation of budgetary funds. Senate member Amit Patil said, “There have been reports about allocation of funds to individual SPPU officials and this needs to be investigated. To this end, I recommend that a committee must be formed by the university. However, the members constituting the committee must not be people working under the officials being investigated nor must they be working together. Hence, I call for an independent group of people to look into the matter.” Santosh Dhore, another senate member, raised questions on the capacity of SPPU EduTech Foundation to conduct university examinations online and demanded that no delay be allowed in the scheduled examination. Giving a gist of what the university has done and what it plans to do, Karmalkar in his inaugural address said, “We have made over 2,500 online videos and other e-learning material during the pandemic... We were able to provide some high-end instruments for testing and sampling to Serum Institute, which not only helped us contribute to the social good but also helped in generating revenue of Rs 60-65 lakh. In the coming years, SPPU plans to publish many rare books. Similarly, a biography of MR Jayakar, the first vice-chancellor of SPPU, will also be published.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/sppu-senate-passes-budget-worth-rs-540cr/articleshow/81608880.cms||Ardhra Nair

Even then, the local administration had a tough time tracing and testing people with Covid-19 symptoms here. MMC’s deputy commissioner Nitin Kapadnis said, “The civic body is ‘helpless’. Repeated appeals and pleas to citizens to get themselves tested are not yielding adequate response.”Kapadnis feared there could be several Covid cases in these areas, especially since patients with very mild symptoms are taking treatment from local doctors. “These doctors are not reporting the cases to the MMC,” he said. Kapadnis claimed that people in other parts of the town were more forthcoming and getting the tests done. On Thursday, state agriculture minister and Malegaon (outer) MLA Dada Bhuse had said that the situation in Malegaon was worrisome, especially with 61% positivity rate. He had called for urgent measures to curb the spread. Mufti Mohammad Ismail, the AIMIM MLA from Malegaon (central), has blamed the civic body. “The corporation does not have the adequate number of doctors to treat patients. When people go for the tests, they have to wait for a long time and are admitted to the hospital till the reports arrive,” Ismail said. He further said the citizens should not to be blamed if they were seeking treatment from local doctors.The mayor and deputy mayor did not return calls or repond to SMSes sent to them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/testing-times-for-malegaon-admin/articleshow/81607908.cms||Abhilash Botekar

After arrival, the elephants will take time to settle down and respond to commands in Hindi by the mahouts, Khandelwal added. “With the jumbos, we will be able to enforce our strategies for mitigating man-tiger conflict , carrying out intensive combing in the forests, especially in monsoon, when much of it is waterlogged,” Khandelwal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/ptrs-proposal-to-get-5-jumbos-from-ktaka-may-finally-take-off/articleshow/81607481.cms||Keshav Agarwal

Worse, the MVA’s principal dramatis personae displayed poor political skills over the last two weeks when the Sachin Waze case blew up in the face of the Thackeray government, they added. Not only has Singh, throwing all caution to the wind, accused Deshmukh of corruption, he has pointed out that he had briefed Thackeray and NCP president Sharad Pawar on the home minister’s “misdeeds and malpractices.” Read AlsoMaharashtra home minister told Sachin Waze to collect Rs 100 crore/month: Ex-Mumbai top copIn a sensational twist to the scandal that has snowballed since gelatin sticks were recovered from a Scorpio parked outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence on February 25, just-transferred Mumbai police commissioner Parambir Singh alleged in a letter to CM that state home minister had setObservers said the developments might increase differences between the NCP and Shiv Sena over how to tackle the situation arising out of the car explosives case. An NCP politician said Saamna had praised Singh for having taken over as CP during the “difficult times” of Covid-19. “Singh’s transfer doesn’t mean he is an accused,” Saamna had noted. Opinion: Sachin Vaze shows how shooting stars burn outSena wants its allies, NCP and Congress, to stand by Thackeray. Sources in Sena recalled that the party was left to fend for itself when its senior minister Sanjay Rathod was in the eye of a storm following the suspicious death of a Pune girl last month.

A Sena functionary said the NCP can’t “wash its hands of the Waze episode” as the party handles the home portfolio. However, the NCP is unwilling to, as one of its leaders said, “share the Sena’s muck.” “If tensions in the MVA escalate, it could trigger the MVA regime’s downhill trundle,” said a former bureaucrat and added the Singh letter could widen the Sena-NCP rift in the weeks to come. The Sena was upset when Pawar retained Deshmukh as home minister, thus making it clear that l’affaire Waze was Sena’s worry. Read AlsoWill file defamation case against Parambir Singh, says Maharashtra home ministerHome minister Anil Deshmukh on Saturday called allegations made against him by former police commissioner Parambir Singh as “baseless, false and a conspiracy to save himself and blackmail the government and to deflect attention” from the explosives case and the suspicious death of Mansukh Hiran.However, both Sena and NCP committed quite a few follies, said political analysts. First, Thackeray remained absent during a stormy discussion on the Antilia case in the assembly. The CM asked a senior Sena minister to represent the party at a meeting held in the office of the deputy speaker, who was keen to quell the acrimony in the house, it is learnt. As leader of the assembly, Thackeray should have taken the initiative to restore peace in the house, said a Vidhan Bhavan expert. Second, not only was the CM adamant on not suspending Waze, he indicated he was going soft on him by saying Waze was not Osama bin Laden. This sparked unrest among NCP ministers.

Sena-NCP equations became fragile when Sharad Pawar didn’t endorse Sena’s stand that NIA was impinging on the state’s autonomy by initiating a probe into the Antilia scare row.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/will-fresh-crisis-in-mumbai-worsen-tensions-within-mva/articleshow/81609410.cms||Ambarish Mishra

Addressing an event organised on the death anniversary of Rani Avantibai, the CM said, “The three new battalions will be named after Rani Avantibai, Uda Devi and Jhalkari Bai at Badaun, Lucknow and Gorakhpur, respectively. Their sacrifice still inspires us to preserve the integrity of the country.” He said the formalities for setting up of the battalions had been completed. Elaborating that Bundelkhand plays a vital role in the freedom struggle, Rani Laxmibai in Jhansi and Rani Avantibai in Ramgarh remained at the forefront. “When the kings of various regions were supporting the British to save their throne, these women took up cudgels against the British. They fought with bravery to protect the country till their last breath,” he said. The CM said that the BJP, in its ‘Sankalp Patra’, had promised to set up three PAC women battalions in the state. “Taking inspiration from women freedom-fighters, the state government launched Mission Shakti for the safety of women. Under this campaign, it is mandatory to appoint 20% women in UP police force so that every woman feels safe and secure,” the chief minister added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/pac-bns-to-be-named-after-3-women-freedom-fighters/articleshow/81609921.cms||---

Travel agents who were seeing activity in the domestic space from December, say trips are being cancelled as travellers are feeling apprehensive. Since December, a growing number of tourists had started opting destinations in the country including Rajasthan, Shirdi, Varanasi, Goa, Kashmir and Ladakh. “We just began seeing enquiries and people had begun booking trips to Rajasthan, Leh and Goa. But they have started cancelling or postponing indefinitely,” says Nirupa Raj of city-based Ashok Travels. “We had some bulk bookings and group trips to Shirdi, which have been cancelled after reports of increasing cases,” says P Krishnaraj of Travel Agents Association of Coimbatore. While some people are still travelling to Maldives and then to Europe and USA for work or study, that does not give them much margins, agents said. “We don’t get much service charge by just booking international tickets, which is what work and study travellers require. Only when we book entire trips for them including stay and sightseeing, do we get margin,” says Krishnaraj. “Now, even people enquiring about Maldives are refusing to confirm as they want to see how the situation unfolds in the next few weeks.” Travel agent Aadhav Raj says the industry continues to suffer. “Domestic travel alone cannot keep the industry going. We need Singapore flights to and from Coimbatore, so it becomes our gateway to southeast Asia and for travelling to the US.” The agents are now banking on vaccines to give people confidence to travel. “Once vaccines penetrate enough people, all countries and states will remove restrictions on tourism,” says Nirupa Raj. “In most of the southeast Asian countries, including Singapore, sightseeing spots continue to be closed to the public.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/travel-industry-fears-covid-roadblock/articleshow/81609399.cms||---

---||Pune||Sharp dip in art & culture funds’ share in India, key posts vacant: Report||Pune: The Art and Culture Budget Guide report of 2021-22, released by the cultural resource organisation Sahapedia, has found that support for the arts and culture sector in India — which employs millions — has been an afterthought in terms of funding, even as other countries have moved to bail out the sector amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The 2021-22 budgetary allocation for the Ministry of Culture, as an example, constitutes less than one-tenth of 1% of the entire Union Budget. Overall allocations to the sector of art and culture, under various ministries, is around Rs4482 crore. From a high of 0.14% of the Budget in 2014-15, the share of allocations for the Ministry of Culture has been largely declining. The pandemic came as a blow, in the form of allocations in the previous year’s Budget being slashed by almost 21%. The report quotes a survey that fears the loss of a large part of the annual income for upto 22% of the “creative” sector, with 16% of those entities staring at closure for good. However, the report notes that the lack of such budgetary support for arts and culture from the Union and state governments is unique, when compared to other major economies in the world. “This is in sharp contrast to several countries such as China, UK, Singapore and Australia, which have increased their budget for the arts and culture sector in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, many times, announcing multi-billion relief packages,” says the report, lead-written by Padmapriya Janakiraman, head of Sahapedia’s cultural mapping project. The report also cited large swathes of vacancies in key cultural institutions, dealing in both tangible and intangible heritage, such as the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), the prominent public libraries and archives, as well as the flagship akademies, which conduct research in languages, indigenous cultures, among others. According to a parliamentary report, around 35% of ASI’s posts remained unfilled, while upto 50-70% of posts in key art and archiving institutions, such as the National Archives and the National Galleries of Modern Art, are vacant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/sharp-dip-in-art-culture-funds-share-in-india-key-posts-vacant-report/articleshow/81608894.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

The incident took place around 2 am. According to police, most of the injured were labourers, who were returning to their homes in Bareilly’s Usita village from Haryana’s Sohna - ahead of Holi celebrations. The dead were identified as Shivam and his sister Dipika. Elder brother, Karan, has been admitted to a hospital along with another passenger, Dhano Devi. The 42-year-old woman's condition is also said to be critical. Others who were admitted with minor injuries were discharged after treatment. Khair station house officer, Pravesh Kumar, said, "It seems the driver of the max pickup (mini-truck) fell asleep at the wheel. He later fled from the accident site." “Twenty-five people were travelling in the vehicle. Nine were women, five men and the remaining children,” he said, adding that the deceased’s parents, who were also travelling with them, escaped unhurt. The bodies have been sent for postmortem and will be handed over to the family after the legal formalities. An FIR has been registered under sections 304 A (causing death by negligence), 279 (rash driving), 337 (causing hurt by an act which endangers human life) and 338 (causing grievous hurt by act of endangering life or personal safety of others) of IPC against the driver at the Khair police station.

---||Kochi||Snake sighting incidents on the rise in Ernakulam district||KOCHI: Uncontrolled construction activities, coupled with dwindling forest cover and poor waste management, has led to increased instances of snake sightings in the district. The special forest protection force of the forest department has rescued many pythons, king cobras, cobras, vipers and non-venomous snakes from the district. While the team rescued around 455 snakes, both venomous and non-venomous, in 2017, the number rose to 790 in 2020. As many as 99 were rescued in the first two months of 2021. Of these, pythons constitute a major share followed by cobras. Surprisingly, the team rescued 10 king cobras so far this year as against nine last year. King cobras are mostly spotted and rescued from the hilly eastern parts of Ernakulam. Their breeding season is between January and first week of March. Detecting pheromones released by female king cobras the males get attracted to them and leave their territory. Forest officials say this might be one reason for their frequent sightings. “Though venomous snakes are nocturnal, king cobras prefer to rest in some cool or wet place in the night and that’s why we receive most of the calls in the night. They prefer to stay away from human habitats but sometimes end up in houses when they lose their way or take shelter in the night,” said Sabu J B, forest officer, special forest protection force. “Killing pythons, which comes under Schedule 1 of Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, will invite seven years of imprisonment. Though king cobras fall under Schedule 2, killing them will invite the same punishment. The pythons were either here in earlier times or reached after floods and made barren lands in the city their home. Pythons prefer the city because they get food like rats in abundance due to poor waste management. Python lays around 30 eggs and all survive in the city as against in the forest, where only around five will survive due to presence of predators. But rampant construction activities lead to these snakes losing their territory,” he added. Most of the snakes being rescued in the district are non-venomous ones, including pythons and wolf snakes. Last year, only 151 venomous snakes were rescued against 713 non-venomous ones. Though vipers were present in the district earlier, it is believed that their number got multiplied when more vipers reached Ernakulam along with quarry sand transported from Tamil Nadu. “The viper should be the one we should be more careful about. It is one among the four most venomous snake species in India. Even the king cobra is not that harmful because it is not commonly found in human habitats,” said Sabu. Those who spot wild animals at human habitat can alert the special forest protection force at 8547604222.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/snake-sighting-incidents-on-the-rise-in-ernakulam-district/articleshow/81608896.cms||T C Sreemol

Amidst much chaos and bullying of Goa WRD officials by Karnataka police, the joint monitoring team had visited the Kalasa project site at Kankumbi in Karnataka on Friday. Later, the team comprising one superintending engineering from each state — Krishnoji Rao of Karnataka, Vijaykumar Thorat of Maharashtra and M K Prasad from Goa — held a meeting at the PWD Inspection Bungalow to compile the report. However, without intimation, Karnataka organised a presentation by a hydrologist to influence the joint monitoring team that Karnataka had not diverted Kalasa waters into the Malaprabha basin, for which Goa has filed a contempt petition in the apex court. This presentation and other pressure tactics led to delay in the work of finalising the report. Discussions continued till late Friday evening and hence it was decided to meet again in the coming week to finalise the report of the team’s findings. As per the SC directives in Goa’s contempt petition, the team was mandated to visit the Kalasa site and to report if Goa’s allegations are true that Karnataka had diverted the Kalasa water into the Malaprabha in defiance of the apex court’s order. The team was directed on February 21 to submit the report within four weeks. However, it is expected that the team will be submitting the report to the SC before the next hearing in the Mhadei matter that has been scheduled on April 5. Goa had filed an interim application in March 2020 seeking directions to restrain Karnataka and Maharashtra from carrying out any activity in implementation of the award on sharing of Mhadei’s water’s passed by the Mhadei Water Disputes Tribunal on August 14, 2018.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/joint-team-to-finalise-kalasa-report-this-wk/articleshow/81609416.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar

Earlier this month, these teachers were dismissed from service. According to the basic education department officials, a large number of candidates had managed to secure jobs as primary school teachers in different districts on the basis of fake B.Ed marksheets for 2004-05 session. Allahabad high court had constituted a special investigation team to probe the B.Ed scam at Agra university. Action is being taken against the “fake teachers” in different districts after SIT submitted its report. In 2019, the SIT had compiled a list of 3,637 candidates who had managed to get B.Ed degrees by fraudulent means. Earlier, 2,823 candidates out of these were declared fake by Agra university administration. Arvind Pathak, BSA, Firozabad, said, “After terminating 57 primary teachers who had managed to secure jobs on basis of fake certificates, the block education officers were directed to register an FIR against all of them. The FIRs have been registered at local police stations concerned in eight blocks where these teachers were teaching. A report in this regard is being sent to the state government. “ The FIR against the teachers has been registered under IPC section 420 (cheating and dishonesty), 466 (forgery of record of court or of public register), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating) and 471 (using as genuine a forged document or electronic record). Last year, the Firozabad district basic education department had terminated and registered FIRs against 70 “fake teachers”. Out of these, only one accused has been arrested so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/fir-registered-against-57-fake-teachers-in-firozabad/articleshow/81608408.cms||Deepak Lavania

---||Mumbai||Bombay HC dismisses plea of actor, mom on three Bandra flats||MUMBAI: Bombay high court on Thursday dismissed an appeal filed by actor Preity Zinta (45) and her mother, Neelprabha, and directed her to hand over share certificates of three flats at Union Park, Bandra (W), to Ace Housing and Construction Ltd, which had bought it from her for Rs 7 crore in 2016. “Zintas cannot take advantage of their own wrong and plead the bar of any law to frustrate proceedings before court,” said a bench of Justices S J Kathawalla and Vinay Joshi in its March 18 judgment. The judges said, “Zintas have admitted receipt of entire sale consideration and they stand by the sale transaction.’’ Following a 2016 deed of transfer, the judges said, “Zintas have also signed share transfer forms in favour of Ace Housing. The certificates must be handed over to Ace Housing.’’ The actor had challenged an interim January 28 order by a judge in a suit filed by Ace for transfer of flats’ share certificates, in custody of HC prothonotary (senior-most officer on administrative side). The company also sought recovery of over Rs 1 crore it paid for Rs 90 lakh it claimed to have paid on her behalf towards refund of a security deposit to her 2015 licensee in the flat. The judge had directed the HC officer to hand over original certificates to Ace and directed the housing society too, to transfer shares to Ace. Zintas had mortgaged the flats earlier with a bank and Ace said the sale amount was to be used to close the loan and hand over a no-dues letter so it would have a clear title. Last year, the construction firm approached HC, apprehending that the bank may take steps against the flat in case of default and Zinta filed an affidavit saying he “no-dues letter” was received in May 2018 and the loan was closed. Hence the new owner, the company, sought the original title documents from the actor. Zinta opposed the plea and HC had last November directed the certificates be deposited with the HC prothonotary. Her counsel said original flat papers could not be given when the dispute (time-barred) was pending. Ace’s counsel said the claim for Rs 90 lakh has no ink with the transfer deed and was ‘interest free deposit’ paid by it on behalf of the actor to her licensee, residing at the time. HC also noted, “Ace has bifurcated its claim.’’ HC said it was clear that Rs.90,00,000 in regard to interest free security deposit was unconnected and not interlinked to sale consideration paid by Ace to Zintas. The actor’s argument that Ace was seeking refund of sale consideration “must fail’’ said HC. HC said, “Even today, Zintas have per se not opposed transfer of shares. Moreover, Zintas have no claims against Ace… Zintas cannot indirectly retain charge of the flats, which they have admittedly sold to Ace under validly executed and registered deeds of transfer, under which Zintas received entire sale consideration.’’ Her arguments of the suit against her being barred by limitation did not appeal to HC. HC said Zinta can raise written arguments of her grievance against Ace’s claim when its suit is heard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/hc-dismisses-plea-of-actor-mom-on-bandra-flats-in-mumbai/articleshow/81609443.cms||Swati Deshpande

In a live address broadcast on the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) social media page at 12.30 pm, Jadhav asked the citizens to cooperate. He said containing the spread of the disease would help in smooth running of the economy.“The number of active Covid-19 cases had been decreasing and economic activities were gaining momentum. However, suddenly, the number of cases have started growing again. In the past five weeks, the number of cases has increased more than 10 times and this has now started affecting our economy,” Jadhav said.The number of active cases in Nashik city has jumped from around 700 in mid-February to more than 8,000 by mid-March. In his address to the citizens, the commissioner appealed to them to avoid visiting hotels/restaurants on weekends during these “trying times”. “Earlier, when there was lockdown everywhere, people relished home-cooked food. Let us stick to the same for some more time,” the commissioner said. He pointed out that the administration was forced to announce the closure of the shops and establishments during the weekends to discourage people from gathering in market places. The commissioner also appealed to the citizens to opt for online shopping of groceries, medicine, grains and even dairy through mobile application, which has been facilitated by the NMC. The rising number of cases calls for restrictions leading to economic loss, which nobody is in favour of. “In order to cut down on the forced closures, citizens should quickly start using masks and sanitisers if stepping out and maintain strict physical distance,” the commissioner said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/citizens-must-follow-covid-protocol-nashik-civic-chief/articleshow/81607933.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

PCB’s preliminary investigations have suggested that the fire originated from the overheated compressor of one of the standalone chest freezers in the market.Ironically, the lack of a centralized cold storage facility for the meat and fish market at Shivaji Market was one of the concerns raised in the comprehensive restoration plan report prepared and submitted to the PCB by the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (Intach) in 2011-12. The report, prepared by prominent conservation architects and historians, had then flagged multiple issues with the market and the area surrounding it. Among the experts’ concerns were cleanliness, improper electricity connections and loose wiring. “We had presented the report to the PCB. The aim was to look after the market in a better manner. But what we found from the PCB or the military authorities was that there was no seriousness to restore that space,” said Kiran Kalamdani, one of the conservation architects who had presented the report.Other experts on that panel said the PCB should restore the structure closest to its original form. “The PCB should restore the structure after the fire. The authentic documentation and plans are available with them,” said Sharvey Dhongde, a conservation architect and part of the Pune chapter of Intach.The PCB has sought Rs5 crore from the district collector to restore and repair the structure. A senior PCB official admitted that the authority would have to consult the decade-old plan.“We will do the restoration work according to the old plan and consult conservation architects for the process. We have sought funds for the project. It would not have been a concern if the structure was a listed heritage building. Funds keep coming in for the maintenance of Mahatma Phule Mandai, as it is a listed heritage building,” a senior PCB official said on condition of anonymity||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/fire-forces-pcb-to-revisit-2011-12-restoration-plan/articleshow/81608902.cms||Shiladitya Pandit
---||Agra||Ahead of panchayat polls, former gram pradhan Found murdered in Kasganj||AGRA: The body of 70-year-old Baburam Sahu, former gram pradhan of Miyasur village — who had been missing since March 15 — under Sahawar police station was found in Bankner forest area, 25 kilometres from his house. The family of Baburam, who had been preparing to contest the upcoming panchayat elections, alleged that he was being “hard-pressed by a few people to stay away from the polls”. Police said the body was found on Thursday evening and sent for the post-mortem examination. It appeared that Baburam was strangled and then thrown in the forest area, said police. According to villagers, Baburam was a very simple and honest man and had been elected as the gram pradhan twice in 1998 and 2005, while his wife Munnidevi was also elected as the gram pradhan in 2000. Baburam used to earn a living by selling disposable cups and plates. “Baburam was asked by villagers to contest the upcoming panchayat elections. On the evening of March 15, he had gone to meet his two sons in the city. After parking his cycle at a local workshop in the village, Baburam had boarded an auto-rickshaw to the city. The entire village has agonised his murder,” said a local. Sahawar station house officer Rajesh Meena said, “Based on the complaint received from the deceased’s family, a case was registered under IPC section 302 (punishment for murder) against Lal Bahadur and Ram Singh, both residents of the same village. The matter is being investigated.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/ahead-of-panchayat-polls-former-gram-pradhan-found-murdered-in-kasganj/articleshow/81608426.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Corp completes preliminary work on digital asset register||Thiruvananthapuram: The city corporation is set to move on from the dusty, old asset registers to the digital mode. The preparation of digital asset register has completed the first phase. Uralungal Technology Solutions (ULTS)did a presentation of the new system here on Friday. The GIS-based digital asset register has been designed in such a way that all the assets of corporation in respective wards have been mapped. The data-driven decision support system can be accessed even on mobile phone with authorized credentials. “This was basically a survey of the assets owned by the Thiruvananthapuram corporation. We have presented it in an enterprise platform for ease of access. The asset registers used by the engineers and officials are in word format and cannot be used effectively for planning projects. On the web GIS platform, the officials or even the citizen can visualize all assets and this would function as a powerful data-driven decision making tool,” said Jake Jacob, head of department, GIS at ULTS. Details of buildings, public wells, offices, drains, roads and other kind of assets have been mapped in this platform. The team collected satellite maps of Thiruvananthapuram and integrated it into the system with details of land, location and other features. Thematic layers have been added to incorporate additional features. The civic body, which has always rued an accurate asset register in terms of planning, budgeting and project implementation, is set to gain a lot from the new system. In 2013, the civic body undertook a road mapping exercise which is by far the remotest exercise done by corporation at asset mapping. Following the process, it was decided to prepare an asset register to include data like the exact number of buildings and offices owned by the corporation, the buildings that got transferred to corporation during the process of delimitation and major and minor assets the civic body had created ever since its inception. The availability of road map was expected to make the process easier and although the officials of health wing, revenue and engineering wing were expected to work together, the project never got under way. The project has been completed at a cost of Rs 35 lakh. ULTS has completed the project in 25 other municipalities, panchayats and two corporations — Kollam and Kannur. Dearth of accurate information on assets has often affected the planning of projects in city corporation. The previous council sessions had even witnessed heated debates over lack of an asset register which led to improper maintenance and encroachments into corporation’s property. The officials said that a digital asset register is going to be a handy tool in terms of planning, zoning, budgeting and even revenue collection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/corp-completes-preliminary-work-on-digital-asset-register/articleshow/81608916.cms||Aswin J Kumar
---||Goa||Karnataka violated Supreme Court order on Mhadei inspection: GFP to CJI||PANAJI: A day after Karnataka police misbehaved and detained staff of Goa’s water resources department (WRD) while carrying out a joint inspection of the Kalasa project, GFP wrote to the Supreme Court (SC) requesting the Chief Justice of India (CJI) to take cognisance of the incident. GFP president Vijai Sardesai said that the behaviour of the Karnataka police amounted to “gross violation” as government officials were abused and treated with disrespect. “By obstructing the Goan delegation from inspecting the Kalasa project, the government of Karnataka and the Karnataka police have violated the Supreme Court’s order and we urge that the apex court look into this matter,” he said. On February 21, the SC had directed that a joint inspection committee consisting of officers from Goa, Maharashtra and Karnataka to inspect the Kalasa project and submit a report within four weeks. The directive came after the Goa government filed a contempt petition against Karnataka on the issue of diversion of Mhadei and breach of orders of the Mhadei tribunal and the SC. On Friday, the Karnataka police restricted the entry of Goan officers and technical staff of the WRD from carrying out their inspection as ordered by the Supreme Court. Goa, Karnataka and Maharashtra have been locked in a tussle over the Mhadei water for the past fifteen years. Karnataka has begun diverting water from the Mhadei basin despite the matter still being sub-judice. “The Goan delegation was made to wait outside the Kalasa project while the joint inspection was being carried out, and had their lDs confiscated by the Karnataka police. Additionally, the Goan delegation reported that they face numerous instances of verbal abuse and were treated with utmost disrespect,” Sardesai wrote in the letter to the CJI. “We express concern towards the attitude and behaviour of the Karnataka government and its police force on handling critical multi-state issues like the Mhadei diversion and worry that they may be attempting to circumvent from the due process directed by the Supreme Court. We look to you and the apex court to examine this matter on behalf of the people of Goa,” Sardesai stated in the letter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/karnataka-violated-sc-order-on-mhadei-inspection-gfp-to-cji/articleshow/81609425.cms||---
---||Agra||Ayodhya to get Shri Ram University, announces UP deputy CM||AGRA: Uttar Pradesh deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma on Saturday announced setting up of a Shri Ram University in Ayodhya. The project worth over Rs 5,000 crore was proposed by a private player, and if all goes well, the university will come up by 2022. Talking to TOI, deputy CM Dinesh Sharma said that the institute will have Vedic maths (a collection of techniques/sutras to solve mathematical problem sets in a fast and easy way), Jyotish Kendra, Karma Kand (ritual services proffered by swamis or religious Brahmins in exchange for dakshina) and research on Gita, Vedic and other religious scriptures, including the Ramayana. He said, “The private player had proposed to establish the university over 50 acres of land in Ayodhya, which has been cleared by the district magistrate.” Even a committee of the state universities has given a report in its favour. If all requirements are fulfilled by them, soon the university will open in the city of Ram. This varsity will become a big institute for research on religious scriptures, he added. The aim of establishing the university is the preservation and development of the ancient and traditional treasure of knowledge and strengthen the culture in youth as well, the deputy CM added. “Many countries, which now know Indian language, traditions and culture, are very well connected to India through yoga, which is an important part of India’s history and culture. Hence, there is a need to highlight such things to develop attraction towards our culture,” said Sharma. “We want to develop Ayodhya as an adhyatmik (spiritual) city,” he said, adding that everything is there, the government is only reviving it. “We are making an attempt to bring back what is being forgotten.” He told TOI that three other state universities are being established, one each in Aligarh, Saharanpur and Azamgarh. In Aligarh, Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh University, in Saharanpur, Maa Shakumbhari Devi University, and the third university’s name is to be coined, he added. The government is also promoting Sanskrit language and for the first time, a directorate is being developed in Lucknow, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/ayodhya-to-get-shri-ram-university-announces-up-deputy-cm/articleshow/81608431.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Bhopal||2.62 lakh doses on single day administered in Madhya Pradesh||BHOPAL: About 2.62 lakh doses of Covid-19 were administered across Madhya Pradesh on Saturday. A 10% jump in inoculation rate in a single day, pushed MP to number ninth in list of states with most vaccine doses administered. The revamped mobilisation campaign has a bottom-up approach. Anganwadi workers to gram panchayats, backed by a robust village level health care setup got the elderly to 4032 vaccination sites. Most of 3796 government vaccination sites are in rural areas. On Saturday, Madhya Pradesh health department administered more doses of the vaccine compared to what 49 big and small countries have not been able to achieve in weeks. It includes the likes of Estonia, South Africa, Cambodia, Bolivia and Cyprus who have inoculated less than 2.5 lakh of their countries population. The massive mobilisation campaign is showing dividends in rural areas of the state. Dewas collector Chandramauli Shukla did a surprise inspection of Covid-19 vaccination centre at the district hospital and instructed to make arrangements at the vaccination centre convenient and smooth for the elderly. He also assisted an elderly woman to get inoculated. About 18% of Dewas district vaccination coverage was on Saturday. Narayan Singh Thakur, aged 73, resident of Avasnagar in Dewas district reached the district hospital with his wife and got the vaccine. Rajni Trivedi, who is eligible in the 60 plus age category, said she was motived by the Anganwadi worker to get vaccinated. Covid-19 hotspot, Chhindwara lead the way in terms of most vaccinations administered. Balaghat, Seoni, Dewas and Satna were in the top five for the day with most doses administered. As a percentage increase, Sidhi district lead others in MP where vaccination numbers spiked 20% on Saturday with more 5000 doses administered. Dewas reported 7000 doses and Seoni reported 7500 doses on Saturday. Shajapur, Raisen, Dindori and Jhabua were at the bottom of the list. Urban areas did not perform as per expectation. Indore, Bhopal and Sagar only reported more than 10,000 doses administered on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/2-62-lakh-doses-on-single-day-administered-in-mp/articleshow/81608908.cms||Jamal Ayub
---||Nagpur||Many vaccinated comorbids, elderly, HCWs, FLWs test positive after crowded centre visit||NAGPUR: The third phase of Covid vaccination programme which started from March 3 has turned out to be a probable super spreader event in the city. TOI has found that a lot of patients with comorbidities and elderly people visited vaccination centres days before they tested positive. Many of them have been vaccinated with the first dose, while a lot of healthcare workers (HCWs) and frontline workers (FCWs) had taken the second dose before they tested Covid-positive. Doctors and civic authorities have ruled out a vaccination failure but said it was likely that these Covid patients were already infected or may have contracted the infection after failing to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour at the centre. On March 3, the Nagpur district witnessed intense crowding at many centres after the government started the drive’s phase 3, allowing age-appropriate groups to get inoculated. The sudden rush had caught district and civic administration off-guard and led to a lot of chaos repeatedly for a couple of days, before the process was streamlined. Kingsway Hospital’s internal medicine expert Dr Harshvardhan Bora said, “Some tested positive two days after vaccination while others showed up on the 15th day. Some HCWs and FLWs tested positive after the second dose." HCWs and FLWs were being forced to queue up with citizens having comorbidities and elderly people since March 3. Dr Mohan Nerker, one of the directors of Seven Star Hospital, is treating three vaccinated elderly Covid patients. “One had to be admitted. Two were on OPD treatment. Maybe they were carrying the virus and neglected symptoms, or it was due to crowding. They tested positive after seven days of first dose,” he said, adding that complete vaccination protection sets in after two months. Infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde said transmission mostly happens indoors, whether it be a vaccination centre, a shop or mall. “This has happened in other countries also. Yet, vaccination ensures severity is less after two doses,” he said. Chest physician Dr Syed Tarique has six vaccinated Covid patients. “They had fever for seven days and finally tested positive. There is confusion among doctors about effectiveness of the vaccine on a virus variant, if any. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) must formulate a treatment plan for vaccinated people. The government must direct ICMR to issue an advisory soon,” he said. Government medical college and hospital (GMCH), Nagpur’s medical superintendent Dr Avinash Gawande said no Covid patient at GMCH so far had mentioned about a history of vaccination or being at any centre before testing positive. Kunal Hospital director Dr Shishir Shrivastav said every place holds a potential Covid hazard. “You are not safe at a vaccination centre if you don’t take complete precautions like wearing a mask, sanitizing hands and distancing. There is no guarantee that you won’t test positive soon after vaccination,” he said, adding beneficiaries must follow norms before, during and after vaccination. Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC)’s chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar said there is a claim that vaccinated people can’t test positive, but vaccination is the only weapon we have to prevent severity of Covid. “Hardly a few test positive after getting vaccinated because of several reasons. At many places, vaccination is less but cases are still spiking. So it is wrong to say cases jumped due to crowding at the centres,” he said. Dr Chilkar said none of NMC’s immunization staff had tested positive. Doctors’ advice during dose Continue to follow Covid norms as you were doing before vaccination Mask, sanitizer, distancing are key even at time of inoculation Vaccination will not give 100% protection, but disease will be mild One person from a family can book a slot and then take the beneficiary Only 10 persons must be allowed at a time at a centre What’s happening HCWs, FLWs, comorbid persons and elderly tested positive 3-15 days after first jab Some HCWs and FLWS tested positive even after second dose Doctors state they may have been infected before or during the vaccination visit||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/many-vaccinated-comorbids-elderly-hcws-flws-test-positive-after-crowded-centre-visit/articleshow/81608442.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Giving a message to people for not being lax, he put mask on the face of shopkeepers and people found without masks in the New Market. The chief minister also placed the mask correctly on the face of the people whose masks were down on the chin. Chouhan said Covid-19 cases are again increasing particularly in Bhopal, Indore and Jabalpur. “Mask is the most effective way to save from the virus and should be worn properly for everyone’s safety,” he said. “If you all will comply with the Covid guidelines, wear a mask, maintain safe distance and take other precautions, the virus can be prevented from spreading and there would be no need for the lockdown. On a precautionary basis, Sunday lockdown has been imposed in Indore, Bhopal and Jabalpur,” said Chouhan. Chouhan reached the New Market area in the evening and appealed to people to join hands to wear masks. “The corona virus is in the air, but masks can save you from it. I have come to appeal you. Please wear your masks”. Chouhan offered masks to at least 25 people in the market including eatery runner Chandrasekhar and other shopkeepers Santosh, Mahendra Jain, Seema.

However, officials said there is need for more coordinated approach to make it a mass movement. Rajya Sabha MP Deepak Prakash was among many who pedalled in Morhabadi area to encourage public to take up cycling as an alternative mode of commute. RMC town commissioner Mukesh Kumar said the once-a-week cycling campaign has many benefits. “The city will be free of vehicular smoke at least for one day and people will develop a healthy habit of cycling,” he said, but added that the response to their campaign is currently fragmented. “The campaign needs lots of effort to convince people to join the drive. We will continue the campaign so that more people can join. We shall also intensify awareness drives,” he said. Ranchi Smart city PRO Amit Kumar said more than 100 people participated from Morabadi alone. Notably, Ranchi is among 95 cities which is a part of the India Cycle Challenge launched by the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/ranchiites-warm-up-to-saturdays-no-car-campaign/articleshow/81608531.cms||---

The three-member committee – comprising state party president Deepak Prakash, leader of legislative party Babulal Marandi and BJP’s organizational secretary Dharampal Singh – will send the candidate’s name to the party’s central unit for final approval. Following the meeting, BJP spokesperson Pratul Shahdeo said, “The party high command will announce its candidate soon. BJP is all set to give a crushing defeat to the mahagathbandhan government in Madhupur.” Madhupur is slated to go for bypoll on April 17 and the result will be announced on May 2, along with the Bengal polls outcome. The nomination for that seat will take place on March 23. The assembly constituency fell vacant in October last year after the death of JMM MLA Haji Hussain Ansari at a Ranchi-based private hospital due to post Covid-19 complications. Saturday’s meeting was a strong indication that instead of its NDA ally Ajsu Party, BJP will put its own candidate from Madhupur. Following the meeting, a party source told TOI, “BJP will field its own candidate in Madhupur and Ajsu Party, being an ally, will support as. We have already accommodated Ajsu Party in the upcoming Bengal polls by giving them one seat (Baghmundi). BJP has a natural claim over Madhupur and there isn’t any confusion or tussle between the two parties regarding that seat.” Sources said that around 12 persons had applied for seeking a ticket for Madhupur, however, the state election committee is going to choose between BJP’s two-time MLA from Madhupur, Raj Paliwar, and Ajsu Party’s Ganga Narayan Singh. In the 2019 assembly election, Paliwar came second while Singh came third. “Some of the committee members, including Deepak Prakash, are backing Singh. Even if the party high command gives its approval for Singh, he will be made to join BJP immediately,” another party source said, adding, “Ajsu Party is now busy concentrating on Bengal polls and there’s a tacit understanding that Madhupur will have a BJP candidate.” Meanwhile, JMM will field Ansari’s son Hafizul Hassan, who was inducted in the state cabinet earlier this year, from Madhupur and its alliance partners — Congress and RJD — will support his candidature.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/3-member-bjp-panel-to-select-candidate-for-madhupur-bypoll/articleshow/81608573.cms||ASRP Mukesh

BSL’s revenues soared to its all-time high in the last six months. In the third quarter of FY 2020-21, the PSU made a net profit of Rs 1,003 crore, highest among all SAIL subsidiaries. A meeting between SAIL management and one of the trade unions — National Joint Committee for Steel (NCJS) — on March 16 did not yield results. A second round of meeting has been organised on March 31 and several employees have already begun demonstrations to build pressure on SAIL. On Friday, hundreds of workers under the banner of Krantikari Ispat Majdoor Sangh (Kims) staged a demonstration inside the BSL plant. The union leaders asked the employees to prepare for strikes if the decisions do not tilt in their favour. General secretary of Kims, Sangram Singh, said, “We have started staging demonstrations at every department from today (Friday). On March 26, we will give a notice to the BSL management and announce our strike.” Meanwhile, JMM’s trade union Jai Jharkhand Mazdoor Samaj (JJMS) burnt effigies of NJCS leaders and SAIL management, expressing displeasure over a failed meeting. Its general secretary B K Chaudhary said, “The wage revision is being delayed by the SAIL management and NJCS leaders under a conspiracy. We are preparing to cease work if our demand is not fulfilled.” Members of Bharat Ispat Karamchari Sangh also burnt effigies and announced to go on strike. General secretary of Centre of Steel Workers (affiliated to AICCTU) Devdeep Singh Diwakar said, “Workers have lost confidence on NJCS leaders as they are acting as puppets of the SAIL management. We will struggle till the end to ensure workers get their rights.” General secretary, Bokaro Steel Workers Union (affiliated to INTUC), Birenderanath Choubey, who attended the NJCS meeting, said, “The NCJS demanded wage revisions at the earliest, but SAIL is against it. The BJP government instead of listening to our demands is indicating to go for disinvestments and privatisation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/steel-psus-workers-protest-wage-revision-delay/articleshow/81608516.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Speaking at the inaugural session of a two-day state-level conclave organised by Jharkhand Legal Services Authority (JHALSA) here, Dr Ranjan said, “The District Legal Services Authorities (DLSAs) have to be more proactive in dealing with this menace.” Citing as an example, the chief justice, who is also the patron-in-chief of JHALSA, said earlier this month, the high court took suo moto cognisance of the Gumla murders in which five members of a family were killed as a result of witch-hunt on February 24 and ordered state officials, including the DGP, to furnish a report on the case. Meanwhile, JHALSA’s executive chairman Justice H C Mishra said the objective behind organizing the state-level meet of DLSA chairpersons from across Jharkhand is to help the authorities concerned understand legal challenges and plan ahead. “The entire funds available to the DLSAs have to be utilized,” he added. Stressing on the importance of Permanent Lok Adalats, Justice Aparesh Kumar Singh, who was also present at the conclave, implored the judicial officers to help the litigants. “The para-legal volunteers, which comprises a huge task force, need to be channelized appropriately to raise awareness on legal and social issues. Legal aid has to percolate down to those in the lower rungs of society,” he said. Justice S Chandrashekhar, while quoting lines from Hammurabi, said, “The poor need to be protected and laws help protect the weak from the strong. The rights of the needy, in terms of access to legal aid, must be ensured, as mandated by the Constitution.” He added, “JHALSA has shaped the lives of many and has provided relief to people coming from different backgrounds. The role of DLSAs is very important when it comes to ensuring justice for the downtrodden.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/proactive-legal-bodies-needed-to-wipe-out-witch-hunt-murders/articleshow/81608582.cms||---

Aruna Gali’s brainchild — The School Radio — is working on enhancing capacities of children and youngsters to communicate and participate in the community. Chabi and Aruna are two of 19 women entrepreneurs handpicked for the Women Startup Program at the Indian Institute of Management, Visakhapatnam (IIM-V). A cohort of 19 women entrepreneurs from Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Odisha who want to create a niche for themselves through their unique startup propositions are part of IIM-V’s programme. The propositions are aligned to a multitude of sectors including healthcare, food and food technology, education and education technology, agriculture, social impact, fashion and apparel. IIM-V began hosting WSP since 2018. In the first edition, the institute saw participation from the largest cohort of women entrepreneurs after IIM-Bangalore. This year, Dr Anita Gupta, adviser and head of the national science and technology entrepreneurship development board of the department of science and technology, launched the event as chief guest. She advised women entrepreneurs to believe that they are unique in themselves, which would help them carve out their niche and succeed. Women entrepreneurs from the 2018 cohort were also present at the launch of the programme.

Then, no need to face the hustle and bustle of any marketplace at this pandemic time. Just scroll through the Amazon site and get Dhapewada’s shirt and Gothangaon’s lac bangles delivered at your home itself. The initiative of the ministry of rural development of the state through Maharashtra state rural livelihood mission, implemented last year to provide leverage to SHGs reeling under the lockdown effect, has started gaining ground. The shirts from Dhapewada and lac bangles of Gothangaon are now among the global online selling products after the state government roped in the international e-commerce portal to boost the economy of self-help groups (SHGs) from Vidarbha and elsewhere in the state. The Dhapewada shirts are being made by an SHG, Gurumauli Mahila Bachat Gat, at Kalmeshwar taluka while the lac bangles by Savangadi Mahila Bachat Gat at Kuhi taluka. Though there are still some hurdles at the ground zero, the development seemed to have brought a sense of pride among the women of two SHGs who wanted to strive and overcome the abject poverty. One of the major issues is transportation as the products being made around 70-80 km away from the city at Dhapewada and Gothangaon. “Every business requires some time to take off. It may be a six months’ time after which we are hopeful to get steady orders through the site. Our products were selected for Amazon around a couple of months back and it may take some time for us to get noticed,” said Mala Kohad of Kalmeshwar taluka’s Dhapewada-based Gurumauli Mahila Bachat Gat whose shirts are now part of the products of the e-commerce giant. Mala is a self-tutored tailor and is also a part of several SHGs which supplies readymade shirts at different places of Vidarbha. “I kept on seeing the YouTube channels to groom myself and collect ideas from the videos of apparel designing. Later, I trained my other co-workers in the Mahila Bachat Gat,” she said. “Our shirts already have a customer base in Nagpur and elsewhere as they are appreciated for finishing, fitting and quality material. Every woman in the SHGs earn around Rs 250-300per day and even more,” said Mala, who also owned a boutique in her village. The pandemic lockdown has badly disrupted the functioning of Savangadi Mahila Bachat Gat, which is involved in lac bangles making, as it has stopped getting delivery of raw materials from Balaghat in Madhya Pradesh, forcing the women of the SHG to work on the plantation fields as daily wagers. “It was the forest department which had imparted us the training of making the bangles in 2015 after we were displaced due to Gosikhurd project and later our village became a part of the tiger project. Since then, we have been earning through making the bangles and selling it to a company at Balaghat,” Lalita Choudhury of Savangadi Mahila Bachat Gat said. She said, “Around few months ago, our local panchayat samiti member had helped us to join the government scheme and get enlisted in Amazon. Though we are yet to resume our bangle-making unit, hopefully our efforts and products would get due recognition.” “Transportation would remain a major challenge for delivery of goods but once we start getting encouraging supports through bulk orders then such issues may be tackled,” Lalita said and added that internet connectivity, modalities to operate the online platforms and meet deadlines are the other major challenges waiting to be met too. Zilla Parishad CEO Yogesh Kumbhejkar, who had implemented the plan in Nagpur division, said getting enlisted on the site was itself a herculean task. “We have specific teams of groups which would help in getting financial assistances through linkages with the banks and also block development officer and team at Panchayat samiti who are tasked to iron out the other ground-level difficulties,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/dhapewadas-shirt-gothangaons-bangles-now-online/articleshow/81608989.cms||Soumitra Bose

Police personnel part of the security arrangements have been listed as complainants. The first FIR, lodged at Thullur police station against the Amaravati joint action committee (JAC), was registered at 8 am on March 8. It cites the case ‘disobedience to order promulgated by a public servant’ and ‘unlawful assembly’ against 14 persons. The other FIRs, registered at 11:50 am, cite the same violation against the same accused with the addition of four more people. The FIRs pertain to the incident when several hundred women marched from villages in the capital region towards Kanaka Durga temple when Tadepalle police intervened and arrested some of them. Both these FIRs mention that the incident occurred at Mandalam Library Centre. Police officials say that each complaint from individual on-field officers is different from others and the offences committed by the accused are different. Amaravati protestors say that action taken against them stands ‘bizarre’ as the cases booked against them don’t stand comprehensively in the eyes of the police and hence the police have chosen to add more FIRs to add more sections. The charges mentioned in these cases include sections 143, 188, 332, 353, 506 r/w 149 of IPC. Additional sections that come in at the remaining FIRs include 509 of IPC and section 51(b) of Disaster Management Act.

The employee, identified as S Srinivas Rao from the instrumentation wing, wrote in the note that he will sacrifice his life in protest against VSP privatisation. The note even mentioned the time and place — at 5:49 pm at the plant’s furnace. As the letter went public, VSP employees informed the police and initiated a search for Srinivas. Investigation revealed that the missing person worked as a foreman in the WRM unit of VSP and had attended the night shift. He made an entry of leaving the WRM unit on Saturday at 6:30 am in the attendance sheet. He left his phone, wallet and other items behind in the factory and wrote the suicide note in the log book of the WRM unit. Further investigation revealed that the subject had made a few calls on Friday night between 10pm and 11pm. Upon verification of the phone numbers he had called, it came to light that the missing person had taken Rs 12 lakh and Rs 38 lakh from two people in exchange for ensuring jobs at RINL and the dockyard. He also told one of the callers that the results of the dockyard candidates were released Friday night. Police said that some more people may have been defrauded in the garb of providing employment by the missing person. Despite an extensive search, Srinivas is yet to be found till the filing of this report. As per steel plant authorities, it couldn’t have been possible for the subject to have jumped into the furnace.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/vsp-staffer-goes-missing-after-writing-suicide-note/articleshow/81608521.cms||---

The three surrendered Maoists are Pangi Jagga Rao (alias Srinu), Pangi Mugiri (alias Vishnu) and Vnatala Narayana (alias Siddu). According to the police, the three were active members of Maoist militia and the party organisation heavily depended on them in the area. According to Visakhapatnam rural SP Bodepalli Krishna Rao, the 31-year-old Pangi Jagga Rao was involved in 12 murders including the murder of Gemmeli Krishana Rao at Vakapalli recently. Jagga Rao is also alleged to have been involved in mine explosions at Chintalaveedi and in four exchanges of fire with security personnel. Having joined the Maoists in 2006, Jagga Rao worked at Pedabayalu as well as the Andhra-Odisha border. He worked in Jana militia and was also a member of Revolutionary People’s Committee (RPC). He has guided many a Maoist squad away from the police and has played a key role in rescuing the injured. The other members who surrendered, 28-year-old Pangi Mugiri and 25-year-old Vnatala Narayana are from the same village. Both joined the Maoist party at a very young age. Mugiri was the commander of Jana Natya Mandali — the cultural wing of the Maoist party. SP Krishna Rao and anti-Maoist operations OSD Satish Kumar said that the three surrendered due to their ‘dislike of Maoist ideology, revolt from the public over Maoist activities and also indiscriminate killing of innocent tribal people by the naxals’. According to the Visakhapatnam rural SP, one of those who surrendered, the 31-year-old Pangi Jagga Rao was involved in 12 murders as well as four exchanges of fire||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/3-maoist-militia-members-surrender/articleshow/81608528.cms||Siva G
---||India||Like Europe’s, Maha’s 2nd wave milder, more virulent||MUMBAI: In the first week of February, Dr Prince Surana was planning to reduce the number of Covid beds in his Chembur hospital from 60 to half. “But by the last week of February, our Covid ward was full. Our nine ventilators were occupied as well,” he said. In BMC’s jumbo facilities too, the downscaling plans drawn up in February first week were discarded as cases started rising. Cases have risen four times between February 15 and now. The second wave, as experts call the present surge, has however not had the same effect on hospital beds. “Beds are not available in the private sector where the number of beds was reduced, but public hospitals have enough vacant beds,” said a civic doctor. The civic dashboard says it too — only 53% of 12,694 Covid beds in the city were occupied as on Saturday. This second wave in Maharashtra, as Dr Pradeep Awate who heads the epidemiology cell of the state public health department said, is milder but more transmissible. The weekly case fatality rate for the state from February 15 to 21 was 0.7%, which declined to 0.32% in the last six days between March 15 and March 20. In the same period, the weekly cases have tripled. The new cases reported in the week between February 15 and 21 were 36,606 and 259 fatalities were reported, while the state added 1.34 lakh from March 15 to 20 and 439 fatalities have been reported so far. A senior doctor from a south Mumbai hospital said that the Covid graph in Maharashtra, especially Mumbai, is similar to the European wave albeit three to four months behind.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/like-europes-mahas-2nd-wave-milder-more-virulent/articleshow/81611565.cms||Bhavika Jain

Heat wave conditions are likely to prevail in coastal districts from Srikakulam to Guntur until March 22. While 58 mandals across the state are expected to experience heat waves, four mandals are expected to be hit by severe heat waves with temperatures rising above 40°C. Bhamini in Srikakulam district is predicted to experience the highest temperature of around 43°C over the next two days. According to a senior official of the Andhra Pradesh State Disaster Management Authority (APSDMA), nearly 22 meteorological regions in East Godavari have been marked red and yellow as warning of heat waves. Temperatures will be more than 40°C, people should take precautionary measures, the official said. India Meteorological Department (IMD) director for AP, S Stella, said that temperatures would increase gradually and dry weather conditions would prevail across the Rayalaseema region. This will cause rise in temperatures from the last week of this month, Stella told TOI while adding that temperatures would be 2–3°C above normal in coastal AP and around 2°C higher in other parts of the state. Concerned district administrations have been asked to take adequate measures to prevent loss of life due to the weather. Newly-elected mayor of Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) Hari Venkata Kumari said, “We will take all precautionary measures in the city with a proper action plan.” Vizianagaram’s Peediseela panchayat secretary Behara Ramya said, “We opened a water kiosk in our panchayat limits on Saturday keeping the heat wave conditions in mind.” Civic bodies have been asked to take all possible steps to prevent loss of lives due to the abnormal weather.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/heat-wave-predicted-in-ap-mercury-to-climb-over-40c/articleshow/81608543.cms||V Kamalakara Rao
---||Goa||Tepid response at Navelim ZP bypoll||NAVELIM: Unlike the municipal areas that went to elections on Saturday, there was not much enthusiasm in the Navelim zilla panchayat constituency, which went to the bypolls. The polling percentage was just 57.5%, leaving the contestants guessing. The main contestants were BJP’s Satyavijay Naik, Mahila Congress president Pratima Coutinho, AAP’s Mathilda D’Silva and independent Edwin (Cipru) Cardozo. The bypoll was necessitated as the Congress candidate died before the elections held in December 2020. The simmering anger and the machination that has taken place in the last few days for the bpoll was visible in the statements of some of the candidates. Two of them indulged in mudslinging blaming the other for negative voting. Congress ZP candidate Pratima Coutinho hit out at her opposition for trying to ruin her chances at winning, while sitting ZP candidate Edwin (Cipru) Cardozo blamed Congress for spreading false information that he was going to join BJP. Cardozo said he would win by a good majority, but said Congress made pamphlets in BJP’s name stating that he will be inducted into the party. “There is no name or signature on the pamphlets. They were thrown on the road in the night to try to influence people’s minds. But people are smart. This is cheap politics. I never speak against parties, but this time it was an attack on me,” he said. The handbill read that Cipru would be formally inducted into BJP after he emerges victorious and added that a vote for Cipru is a vote for BJP In turn, Coutinho alleged “dirty politics” was being played against her. “The BJP along with Churchill Alemao have all come together with a one-point agenda, to defeat me. Muscle power and money power has been used and people are receiving threatening phone calls,” she alleged. When asked whether she had filed any complaints she said no. “I want to focus on the election and concentrate on how to get more people out to vote. Also the police and government is theirs and my complaint will fall on deaf ears,” Coutinho said. In polling booth 12 voters had two of their fingers on their left hand inked, their middle and index for the panchayat and the ZP elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tepid-response-at-navelim-zp-bypoll/articleshow/81609590.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Goa||Babush tells rebels he is here to stay||PANAJI: Taking a swipe at his detractors within BJP, Panaji MLA Atanasio Monserrate on Saturday said that BJP functionaries who are eyeing the Panaji assembly constituency need to look for greener pastures elsewhere. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the Corporation of City of Panaji elections, Monserrate said that BJP leaders and rebel karyakartas who supported the We Ponjekar panel have no standing any more within Panaji or BJP. The Congress-turned-BJP MLA admitted that close to 50% of BJP karyakartas in the state capital are working against him, but said that it would have no effect on the BJP-backed panel’s chances. “These people, some rebel leaders from the BJP, feel that Babush is going to leave and then they will get a chance,” said Monserrate, adding that he has categorically told the former MLA that “Babush is here in BJP, he is staying here in BJP, and you have got no chance whatsoever as far as Panaji is concerned. You look for your pastures somewhere else”. Monserrate’s move to sideline senior BJP karyakartas and councillors has rankled some of the party’s old guard, who have overtly and covertly come out in support of the We Ponjekar panel. According to political observers, in some wards, there was strong undercurrent against Monserrate’s candidates, but whether that has translated into votes for rival candidates will only be known on counting day. Monserrate, who said that he likes to see his opponents face to face, said that the political developments in the run-up to the civic polls have shown him who his detractors are. “A leader is one who comes out in front and shows his face, and anyone working behind the curtains is a coward. If you are a leader, you yourself contest. Why are you putting proxies in front?” he asked. He also accused BJP rebel workers, Congress and AAP of working together only to defeat him and not for the betterment of the capital city. “Congress does not have the strength, and that is the reason they did not float a panel. They cannot defeat BJP alone and that is why the they have come together with AAP and others. And the rebel BJP leaders are trying to support them. They are looking at some ray of hope with the rebels, but the rebels are people who have lost their ground,” said Monserrate. Monserrate won the 2019 Panaji by-elections on a Congress ticket, but quickly switched over the BJP, along with nine other Congress MLAs. Monserrate had defeated Kuncalienker to win the Panaji seat, but today, the two are party colleagues, a sore point for many staunch BJP workers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/babush-tells-rebels-he-is-here-to-stay/articleshow/81609597.cms||Newton Sequeira

Senior MGP leader Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar had filed the petition against two former MGP MLAs — deputy chief minister Manohar Ajgaonkar and PWD minister Deepak Pauskar. Recently, MGP had decided to withdraw one of the two disqualification petitions that it had filed— one in May 2019 and the other a while after that. Patnekar has summoned Dhavalikar on March 22. MGP had three MLAs in the 40-member House, which reduced to one after Ajgaonkar and Pauskar quit MGP to join BJP in March 2019. At the time, the two MGP legislators had submitted a letter to the speaker claiming that two-thirds of the party had merged with BJP. MGP had challenged the claim with Dhavalikar stating that the 10th Schedule of the Constitution does not postulate such a merger.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mgps-disqualification-plea-to-be-heard-on-mon/articleshow/81609608.cms||---

Long queues were seen at most polling booths throughout the day and the large voter turnout was efficiently handled by the election staff on duty. No major complaints were received from any parts of South Goa. Though hand sanitisers were being provided at all the polling booths, and thermal scanning conducted in some, social distancing was followed more in the breach. At some polling booths, large queues were seen even minutes before the election was to end at 5pm. However, even those who had turned up at the polling station by closing time were allowed to cast their vote. At Cuncolim where a fierce battle is being played out between the BJP and the father-son duo of Joaquim and Yuri Alemao to hold sway over the civic body ahead of the 2022 assembly elections, the outcome of the elections is anybody’s guess. Observers say the political career of both the arch-rivals hinges on the outcome of these polls. It also turned out to be a matter of prestige for the BJP as chief minister Pramod Sawant himself descended there, obviously to drum up support for his brother-in-law, outgoing councillor Videsh Naik Dessai. In Curchorem, Congress has miserably failed in registering its presence in the civic polls, thereby providing victory to BJP in on a platter, notwithstanding which candidate turns out trumps.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/many-seek-to-have-their-say-at-curchorem-cacora-cuncolim/articleshow/81609619.cms||---
---||Nagpur||‘Traditional Indian food habits enough to make us healthy again’||Dr Suneeti Khandekar is arguably the only MBBS doctor practicing nutrition full-time in Nagpur since more than a decade. Though her main focus has been on kidney-related diet, she has done valuable work in the field of ‘nutrition for all’. Dr Khandekar’s two books – in English and Hindi – have been widely appreciated. Known for explaining nutrition in a common man’s language, she spoke to TOI in the backdrop of ‘World Kidney Day’ about the different aspects of nutrition — from kidney to Covid-19. Excerpts... Q. What inspired you to write a book on diet for diseases related to the kidneys? A. While practicing medicine at Hinduja Hospital, I realized that diet plays the most important role in maintaining health parameters, especially for the health of the kidneys. Indians have different types of food habits and there are many misconceptions about diet in our society. Dietary interventions can bring about many positive changes in maintaining the health of the kidneys. People hardly understand the medical terminologies. So, dietician Rachna Jasani and I decided to write it in simple language. Our first book was in English because we are comfortable with the language. Recently, we came out with the Hindi version. In India, we hardly have a diet-related research focused on diseases related to the kidneys. This book became a much-needed addition to the research. Q. What kind of misconceptions have you come across in people? A. There are many. On falling ill, we stop eating, just because we don’t feel like eating. In many families, tasteless food is prepared for the patient in the name of healthy non-spicy food. Not eating good food results in further weakness. In many families, parents offer fast food, packaged food to kids as they don’t eat normal home cooked food. Parents feel that the kid is at least not hungry and eating something. But this practice results in many lifestyle-related diseases in the future. Patients stop the intake of protein with the thought that it will further damage their kidneys. Even if your kidneys are not functioning in full capacity, you can have a calculated intake of proteins through normal food. The only thing is that we must maintain the portion specifically. Q. In what way are lifestyle-based diseases different from the ones pertaining to the kidneys? A. Diabetes, hypertension and obesity are some of the lifestyle-based diseases which could result in kidney failure in the future. Such diseases are preventable by altering food habits and exercising. Following good food habits can stop kidney diseases at the diabetes and hypertension level. As damage in kidneys cannot be reversed, we are left with no option but to delay kidney failure with medication. It’s better to prevent it at the entry level. Q. What kind of food habits can prevent kidney problems? A. The recent research on nutrition and kidney diseases has been done by westerners based on their lifestyle. But in India, we must understand the way we live and eat. Following traditional Indian food habits is the best option to keep kidney diseases at bay. A heavy breakfast with local food used to be our strong point. We hardly had oats and flexes. Poha, jowar bread (bhakri) etc. used to be a part of our diet. Seasonal fruits, a light lunch at a fixed time and early dinner used to be our habits earlier. Unfortunately, we have stopped following most of these practices. Late night dinners are putting pressure on our digestive system. Items like packaged food, cold drinks and caffeine are taking a toll on the health of our kidneys. Q. Does traditional Indian food fulfil all our dietary needs? A. Our food has all the dietary factors – right from carbohydrates, vitamins, proteins and even micronutrients. Freshly-cooked food is nothing less than any medicine. Though our grandparents or their grandparents never had anything like dietary supplements, they used to be healthy and fit throughout their life. In those times, there were no environmental issues like pollution, but dietary factors played the most important role. Youngsters must control the intake of fast food. Such foods only stimulate one’s taste buds but nutritionally, they are a failure. Having fast food once a week or once in a fortnight can be taken into consideration, but having it regularly will definitely land you in trouble. Home cooked, traditional and locally available food is the best. Q. Does Indian food, especially vegetarian, lack protein? A. It’s nothing like that. As I said earlier, calculated intake of protein is a must. We can get enough protein from Indian food. Even pure vegetarian food can provide enough protein. Having more dal, sprouts, curd, milk, paneer etc. can provide a protein-rich diet. Our research has even proved that the high protein intake that professional body-builders require can also be fulfilled through a proper vegetarian diet. The only thing is that we must learn the calculation of protein. Q. The pandemic has disturbed regular schedules. Any suggestions to make changes? A. Lockdown and restricted movements have brought many limitations on people. Many have lost their time-table. Constant and unnecessary eating has become a part of people who are working from home. Many have gained excess weight. Stress due to financial uncertainty has increased immensely. This may be the beginning of lifestyle-based diseases. Such people should have fresh fruits, vegetables instead of packaged food. Have enough water. Make sure you don’t seat continuously for a long time. In-house walking after every 15-20 minutes of sedentary work is good. Screen use has increased multifold during Covid-19 times. Our eyes and brain are hyper stimulated. Having a glass of warm milk with a pinch of turmeric and sugar before going to bed can be a good solution. Even diabetic and kidney patients can have a glass of milk.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/traditional-indian-food-habits-enough-to-make-us-healthy-again/articleshow/81608612.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

With people not following any measures to safeguard against the coronavirus, experts have warned of a further rise in infections. The caseload of Panaji reached 128 in the past 24 hours, with another high profile wedding contributing to the state capital’s rise on the Covid graph. The state’s case positivity rate rose to 8.6%. Most of the new infections in Panaji reported during the day were from Dona Paula, Caranzalem and, Miramar. Along with Margao, Panaji has been reporting 15 to 20 cases over the last ten days. Margao’s tally rose to 112, while that of Ponda, which has a population of over 75,000, increased to 96. Cortalim, Mapusa, Candolim, Porvorim, Ponda, Chimbel, Vasco and Cansaulim are also witnessing a steady rise. The rapid jump in fresh infections on Saturday surprised doctors as normally on a weekend fewer cases are reported. The rise in infections was detected even as tests conducted during the last 24 hours were less than on Friday. On Saturday, 1,772 swab tests were done. No casualties were reported during the day, with 56 patients declared cured. As many as 78 patients were home isolated and 10 were hospitalised.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/jump-in-new-covid-cases-active-caseload-now-996/articleshow/81609638.cms||---

PM Care-er taka gelo kothaye? (Modi has appropriated money raised to fight Covid. Where has the PM Cares fund gone),” she asked. “They are the biggest tolabaaz”. Mamata claimed BJP had realised that the only way it stood a chance against her was through unfair means. “They can’t fight me politically — so they are using money to buy votes and intimidating people with raids and arrests. They are dictating whom we should worship, what we should eat. India is waiting for Bengal. Once they are routed in Bengal, they know they will face a similar fate in other states, too.” The CM and her nephew, Abhishek Banerjee, also slammed the PM for his remark that while 50 minutes of social media disruption on Friday evening left millions worldwide in a tizzy, people in Bengal had suffered 50 years of no development. “The PM knows Facebook and WhatsApp were down for 50 minutes. But does he know about the death of migrants or even Hathras? Their politics is all about FB and WhatsApp, but we fight on the streets. They speak of doubleengine; it will be double corruption from Kolkata to Delhi,” Abhishek said at a rally in West Midnapore’s Daspur.

Once they are routed in Bengal, they know they will face a similar fate in other states, too.” The CM and her nephew, Abhishek Banerjee, also slammed the PM for his remark that while 50 minutes of social media disruption on Friday evening left millions worldwide in a tizzy, people in Bengal had suffered 50 years of no development. “The PM knows Facebook and WhatsApp were down for 50 minutes. But does he know about the death of migrants or even Hathras? Their politics is all about FB and WhatsApp, but we fight on the streets. They speak of doubleengine; it will be double corruption from Kolkata to Delhi,” Abhishek said at a rally in West Midnapore’s Daspur.

---||Goa||Two test positive after 1st vaccine dose, recover||PANAJI: Two persons – a health care worker (HCW) and a frontline worker (FLW) – tested positive for Covid-19 after receiving the first dose of the vaccine. Both have been cured. While other states have reported cases of people contracting the virus after receiving both vaccine doses, a health service official said no such case has been reported in Goa so far. “As of now, we haven’t come across a case of anyone contracting coronavirus after being administered both vaccine doses,” the health official said. Even after getting both doses, one could still contract the virus, but the severity of the infection will be less. A patient will recover faster and avoid hospitalisation if he is vaccinated, the official said. “Since it takes time to build antibodies in the system after administration of the second dose, people are required to take precautions for 14 days,” he said. Till Friday, 42,102 senior citizens, 7,253 people with comorbidities, 15,493 HCW, and 10,438 FLWs have been vaccinated. Health services have set a target of vaccinating about 1.5 lakh people by the end of next month. However, with the response being far from encouraging, it is unsure whether this target will be achieved. The official said they may look at other options and decide another strategy after the task force committee meets next week. “We would have done well if there was more support from elected representatives, whether panchayat members, councillors, or MLAs, in convincing people that they need to take the vaccine,” he said. Another official said, they would have been in a better position if more people were inoculated when the infections were low so that at the time of a spike, the severity of infections remains low, hospitalisations are reduced and health infrastructure is able to sustain the caseload. From the first week of March, Goa has reported a steady rise in cases. In the last two days itself, 254 new cases have been reported.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/two-test-positive-after-1st-vax-dose-recover/articleshow/81609656.cms||---

This is probably the first of its kind attempt in the country to arrest Covid spread. Civic chief Radhakrishnan B said photos of of people — with and without mask — coming to testing centres will be clicked via an app developed by a city start-up. Positive patients will be automatically detected by the CCTV system. They will then be fined and put in institutional quarantine. On Saturday, guardian minister Nitin Raut and divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar gave the green signal to implement the system. Leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis said the system will help in containing the spread of the disease. “Test were successfully conducted. However, some modifications are needed,” said Radhakrishnan. Photos of the patients will be linked with the identification number generated by the ICMR when they come for Covid tests. “Pictures of those who test negative will be automatically deleted. The app will be connected with the city operation centre of the Smart City Project at the NMC headquarters,” said Radhakrishnan. The civic chief said facial recognition will be done using artificial intelligence. “CCTVs will detect the patient automatically and create an alert. Zonal civic staff will then visit the home of the violator immediately, levy a fine of Rs 5,000 and admit the person in an institutional quarantine,” said Radhakrishnan. The NMC has said that positive patients in home isolation have been roaming around in public places and increasing chances of Covid spread. IN A NUTSHELL * Photos of those coming to testing centres to be clicked via new app * If -ve, they will be deleted * Those positive will be linked with the ID generated by ICMR * App linked to 3,800 CCTVs * Using artificial intelligence, CCTVs will do facial recognition * Civic staff will visit homes, levy fine of Rs 5,000 and admit positives in institutional quarantine for 10 days||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/facial-recognition-to-nab-ves-out-of-homes/articleshow/81609096.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

With 19 of BJP’s candidates from the southwestern constituencies in attendance, the PM said at a rally in Kharagpur that “Bengal’s mafia udyog” and “the prevalent bhaipo(nephew) single-window system” needed eradication. “There will not be bhoy (fear) this time; there will be joy (victory),” he said, exhorting voters to vote without fear and the administration and cops to work without bias. BJP had won the Kharagpur Town seat in 2016, but Trinamool wrested it in the subsequent bypoll in 2019. “Didi has betrayed the poor, the adivasis and the backward classes and turned her government into a ‘lootmar’ government. Adivasis and those living off the forest have to give cut money to even sell kendu leaves,” he said. “The nation is progressing towards a single-window system, but here in Bengal only the bhaipo single-window system works. Nothing can happen without passing through this window. Existing industries are shut because of TMC syndicates.” Alluding to Friday’s social media snag, the PM said, “WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram applications were down yesterday for 50-55 minutes.

---||Mumbai||Offline exams safe option for SSC, HSC students: Maharashtra education minister||MUMBAI: Maharashtra State Board of Secondary & Higher Secondary Education will conduct re-exams in SSC and HSC in July or August for students who do not clear in the first attempt.  “We consulted stakeholders over the last few days and took suggestions to safely conduct board exams. Considering geography and demographics of the state, we were clear that conducting offline exams would be the only option. We tried to make it safe and student-friendly,” said school education minister Varsha Gaikwad. Exams will begin half an hour before the scheduled 11am to give students extra time. Times ViewConsidering that an online testing format is unfeasible in the state, measures announced by education department to conduct HSC and SSC exams are student-friendly but it may be too late to vaccinate staff. It also will be necessary for the state monitor the situation closely with rising Covid-19 cases, and be prepared with a solution if exams cannot be held as planned.Practical exams for class X and XII students from arts, commerce and HSC vocational will be replaced by assignments. For class XII students from science, practicals will be conducted on the basis of few shortlisted experiments. “Conducting practicals in school has been tough this year, so students will be given a concession. We decided to do away with science practical exams for SSC, replacing it with internal assignments. As practicals in HSC are crucial for professional courses, we have not cancelled them, but limited experiments to five/six this year,” said Gaikwad. Detailed guidelines will be issued to schools in few days. Assignments and practicals will be from May 21 to June 10. Students who cannot appear for practicals or submit assignments in time will get 15 extra days this year. To ensure students reach exam centres in MMR, government is sending a proposal to allow students and parents to use public transport if they present hall tickets. Gaikwad said the department wrote to state chief secretary to consider exam supervisors and board officials as frontline workers and prioritise vaccinations. If there is a shortage of space in schools, students can go to nearby schools.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/offline-exams-safe-option-for-ssc-hsc-students-maharashtra-education-minister/articleshow/81611631.cms||Vinamrata Borwankar
---||Delhi||Delhi government drops ration delivery scheme name after Centre’s red flag||NEW DELHI: A day after the Centre red-flagged Delhi government’s plan for doorstep delivery of ration, “Mukhyamantri Ghar Ghar Ration Yojana”, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal asked the food department to drop the name of the scheme and prepare to launch it without any name. The Centre had conveyed to the state government that it cannot use the highly subsidised foodgrains from the central pool under the National Food Security Act for the scheme. It was scheduled to be launched on March 25. At a meeting with officials of the food department on Saturday, the CM asked officials to make the necessary change in the scheme and put it up before the cabinet. “We have called a cabinet meeting on Monday where this scheme will be passed. It will not have any name. After the cabinet nod, we will send it to the central government, and I am very hopeful that this time the Centre will approve it,” said Kejriwal, addressing a press conference. Our only aim is to send ration to Delhiites: CMKejriwal said he wants to provide ration at the doorstep of beneficiaries to check the mafia and does not want to take any credit. "But we will not allow any hurdle to stop us and have decided to accept all the directions and clauses proposed by the central government. Our only aim is to send ration to the citizens of Delhi. We only want Delhi's poor to get clean ration without any difficulty. If this happens, I will get peace and we will get the blessings of the poor," he said. The CM pointed out that getting ration from PDS shops is a tedious task for beneficiaries. "All ration shops are supposed to open every day, but generally they open only for two or three days. This makes getting ration very difficult and many ration dealers mix unhealthy materials in it. In many cases, the dealers also charge the poor extra," said the CM, adding that this is what had prompted his government to come up with the scheme. Kejriwal said the Centre has conveyed to the Delhi government that it cannot keep the name Mukhya Mantri Ghar Ghar Ration Yojana. "It looks like they have some issue with the use of the word Mukhya Mantri. The Centre has written that the name of the scheme will make it look like a state government scheme. I want to make it very clear that we did not plan this scheme to get any credit. We believe that all the credit should go to others and all the work should be done by us. All the responsibilities are with us and this is our principle," he said. The scheme for doorstep delivery of ration is very close to Kejriwal’s heart. "It is very important for me to defeat the ration mafia and to ensure that every poor person of the state gets ration at his or her doorstep. This is a personal battle for me," said the chief minister. "My fight with the ration mafia began about 22 years ago. I used to work in the income tax department and then I quit to work for the poor in Delhi. I used to work with the residents of JJ clusters and slums in Nand Nagri, Sundar Nagari and Seemapuri. That was when I learned how the citizens of Delhi struggle to get ration. We discovered how the ration mafia worked and how they would fake signatures of the poor. We saw how the poor do not get ration and how the mafia robbed them. We protested against the mafia, we fought for the rights of the poor. During this struggle, many of our fellow protesters faced attacks from the mafia. Despite the struggle, we could not change much in the system,” Kejriwal said. The CM said the ration mafia is very powerful. "They have good links and they never wanted this scheme to be implemented. I was confident that our dream of 22 years will become a reality but yesterday when we received this letter, it made me feel a bit sad," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-government-drops-ration-delivery-scheme-name-after-centres-red-flag/articleshow/81611635.cms||Alok KN Mishra
---||Nagpur||6 days after killing tigress T1’s cub, Umred big cat Surya mauls another||NAGPUR: Six days after Umred-Karhandla-Paoni wildlife sanctuary’s dominating male T9-aka Surya killed one cub of T1 nickedname Collarwali, its another eight-month-old female cub was found dead on Saturday evening. This is the 10th tiger death in the last 78 days in Maharashtra. Earlier, on March 14, Surya had not only killed one cub of Collarwali but also consumed its meat. Collarwali had three eight-month-old cubs but of late it was seen with Surya, who has been forcing the female to become his new sexual partner. CCF & Pench field director Ravikiran Govekar termed the cub’s death as a case of infanticide, which involves the killing of young offsprings by a mature animal of the same species. The practice has been observed in many species throughout the animal kingdom. Govekar said the second cub was found dead in compartment no. 363 in Karhandla beat. The upper portion of the cub is eaten up. Pugmarks of an adult male have also been seen near the spot. The cub’s carcass will be disposed of as per the NTCA guidelines and SOP on Sunday. The Collarwali tigress had migrated from Tadoba’s Kolsa range and made Karhandla its home in December 2017. It had three cubs from former male partner C2. Whereabouts of C2 are not known for the past four months. Surya, born to Pandharpaoni tigress Maya, had stepped into Karhandla from Tadoba in December 2019. Tourists had sighted Surya and Collarwali together moving in the park in recent times. For the past eight days, Surya was seen mating with Collarwali tigress. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years depending on the tiger density in the area, before they become independent and leave their mother's home range to establish their own territory. Collarwali’s cubs were too small to live on their own. Officials informed the female tried to protect her cubs from Surya and was moving outside the park in the FDCM area but when it returned in March first week, Surya entered into a sexual conflict with her.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/6-days-after-killing-tigress-t1s-cub-umred-big-cat-surya-mauls-another/articleshow/81608740.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

---||Chennai||Chennai: Central Square to turn green by August||CHENNAI: Soon, instead of sweating it out at Central Railway Station’s waiting hall before boarding a train, you can relax on a pruned lawn under wooden canopies by a water fountain. Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL) is set to complete a part of the planned renovation involving landscaping and seating area before August. Work is on in front of Ripon Buildings and Victoria Hall as part of the Central Square project for an intermodal transport facility. The project is expected to provide a seamless link from suburban, MRTS, metro and MTC services to long distance trains and buses. “We have undertaken landscaping from Raja Muthiah Road up to Central railway station covering Ripon Buildings and Victoria Hall. Renovation up to Victoria Hall should be ready before August. Near Central station, it might take some time,” said a CMRl official. “Once the renovation is completed, the features that we are adding are really going to make the area lively.” CMRL took over the area in front of Ripon Buildings and Victoria Hall in 2012, during the construction of Central metro underground station and its tunnels. After the station opened, pedestrians or commuters waiting for a long-distance train or a bus could relax in the outdoor seating area. Motorists could also park vehicles in the underground lot, which is under construction. The three-level parking lot can accommodate nearly 800 cars. Several other facilities besides landscaping and parking lots have been planned. There will be four pedestrian subways, two of which are already open. The rest are under-construction. The will provide a link from the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital to Central railway station and Evening Bazaar Road. The highlight of the project, CMRL officials say, will be the Central Plaza building that will soar 31 floors above the ground. It will be surrounded by bus bays and is expected to have passenger amenities, facility for bus crew, commercial space for offices and retail outlets as well as a restaurant on the top most floor with a panoramic view for the visitors. A CMRL official said contractors were identified and clearances obtained for construction of the building and bus bays. “We will renovate the Rajah Sir Ramasamy Mudaliar Choultry heritage building and convert it into a metro rail museum. But that will happen at a later stage,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-central-square-to-turn-green-by-august/articleshow/81611644.cms||---

Hospital admissions have gone up in Chennai, Coimbatore, Chengalpet, Tiruvallur, Kancheepuram, Tirupur and Thanjavur in the last one week, said director of medical education Dr R Narayanababu. In Chennai, which had 458 new cases, admissions in government and private hospitals increased by afternoon, with patients also coming in from neighbouring Chengalpet, Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur. Chengalpet reported 134 fresh cases, Tiruvallur 87 and Kancheepuram 41. Coimbatore had 103 new cases and Thanjavur 85. Other districts reported fewer than 35 new cases.

All 20 ICU beds in the hospital were taken. Doctors said that most people tested and treated early recovered quickly, but morbidity and mortality was high in patients who are admitted late. “Some patients report to hospitals a week after they have symptoms. When they come to the hospital they are breathless because the virus has invaded and destroyed their lungs,” said RGGH dean Dr E Theranirajan. “The rules of the pandemic have not changed. It is important for people to wash hands, wear a mask, avoid crowded places and always maintain social distance. It is important to trust the vaccine and take it,” said National Institute of Epidemiology deputy director Dr Prabhdeep Kaur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/hospitals-filling-up-in-tamil-nadu-as-covid-19-cases-rise/articleshow/81611651.cms||---

Till February-end, Delhi had 1,335 active cases of Covid-19. Due to a spike in infection, this figure has increased by more than two and a half times. According to data shared by the Delhi government, there were 3,409 active cases in the national capital as on Saturday. The increase in cases was reflected in the occupancy of beds reserved for Covid-19 patients also which went up from 8% to 15% in the last 20 days, from February 28 to March 20. Private hospitals like BLK, Max, Venkateshwar, Fortis Escorts Heart Institute, Sir Ganga Ram and Akash Healthcare among others said they had less than 50 beds available for Covid-19 patients, as per updates shared on the Delhi Corona App. The occupancy of Covid-19 ICU beds with and without ventilator support is 21% and 17%, respectively, officials said. “Both my parents got infected with Covid-19 and now they are admitted to the hospital. The pandemic is still on and people aren’t following Covid appropriate behaviour which is putting the lives of the vulnerable ones like my parents who are above 60 years old and have co-morbidities at risk,” a 35-yearold woman, who lives in East of Kailash, said. Even public health specialists say that lack of adherence to Covid appropriate behaviour, chiefly wearing a mask, following distance and washing hands regularly, was behind the spike. “People have become complacent. Some have given up and there are others who feel that the pandemic is over. Both are wrong and causing complacency, which is fuelling this crisis. Public awareness campaigns are needed to make such people realise the importance of continued safety measures,” said a senior doctor. He added that vaccination also needed to be scaled up to cover those at highest risk to develop severe symptoms of getting the disease. In November last year, Delhi recorded nearly 6,000 new cases of Covid-19 daily. However, the situation improved dramatically between December (2020), January (2021) and February (2021) with the city recording a few hundred cases daily. However, since March 1, the daily cases have been on the rise.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/fresh-delhi-cases-cross-800-in-day-positivity-rate-tops-1-after-2-months/articleshow/81611659.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

In at least the constituencies of Harbour, Egmore and Perambur their votes might be one of the deciding factors especially in case of a close fight. Over the years, many community members have settled in areas such as Perambur, Anna Nagar, Red Hills, Tambaram and Velachery. Issues such as Ram Mandir and revival of India as a “Hindu Rashtra” seem to be among the influencing factors for these non-Tamil speaking voters in three to four constituencies in the city. Their leaning towards Prime Minister Narendra Modi could sway their votes to the AIADMK camp, according to a cross-section of community members.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); “The majority will vote for BJP as PM Modi is like a cult leader despite the wrong policies that hit many of our businesses,” said a 50-year-old Rajasthani businessman, on condition of anonymity. A voter in Harbour constituency, he said members of the community settled in other parts of the city shared similar sentiments. The BJP was keen to get Harbour constituency in the AIADMK alliance and has fielded its state youth wing president Vinoj P Selvam against P K Sekhar Babu, sitting MLA of the DMK.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); Until 2009, many of these residents were not active voters. The Rajasthan youth association began a series of campaigns during the 2009 and 2011 elections to motivate people to exercise their franchise in the city. “We took up a campaign – Aapki taakat aapka vote’ (your vote is your strength) – and reached out not only to the Rajasthan community but also to other north Indian communities. Now, at least 70% of the people exercise their voting rights,” said Sanjay Bhansali, former president of the Rajasthan youth association. Read AlsoTamil Nadu: No Amma, no Kalaignar. It’s EPS vs StalinThe stage is set in Tamil Nadu for a do-or-die battle between AIADMK member and outgoing CM Edappadi K Palaniswami (better known as EPS) and DMK president M K Stalin. For the first two years of his tenure, it was life on tenterhooks for EPS as AMMK functionary T T V Dhinakaran unleashed sustainedDiffering from others, Ashok G Lodha, a former national vice-president of the All India S S Jain Conference, said, “Earlier, there was a BJP wave. Now, both the national parties have an equal share of votes among the communities.” Lodha’s family has been living in Chennai for four generations. There are at least 30,000 voters in Harbour constituency, 20,000 in Perambur constituency and 15,000 voters in Anna Nagar constituency from these communities, they said. Not just in Chennai, cities such as Coimbatore also have a small presence of Gujaratis and Rajasthanis comprising at least 3,000 voters in a few constituencies. Union minister Smriti Irani had campaigned in Sowcarpet in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. However, Sekar Babu disputes the view that the BJP has a large support base among Rajasthanis and Gujaratis in Harbour constituency. “The DMK and its ally Congress have traditional vote banks here. The Modi wave of 2016 has faded due to his poor policies such as demonetisation and GST that hit their businesses,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/tamil-nadu/non-tamil-speaking-voters-may-sway-polls/articleshow/81611665.cms||Shanmughasundaram J
---||Ranchi||Students left in lurch after NCTE cancels affiliation of teachers training institute||Ranchi: A delegation of students of the Government Teachers’ Training College in Kanke on Saturday met deputy director, higher education, Dr Sahabuddin to seek help after the National Council for Teacher’s Education (NCTE) withdrew the affiliation of their institution for the upcoming session. According to sources, the directorate has sought one week time to initiate steps for recognition of the institution. Although NCTE had cancelled the recognition in a letter dated August 28 2019, the state government and the Jharkhand Combined Entrance Competitive Examination (JCECEB) got students enrolled for the 2020-22 session. Due to the pandemic, the enrolment was done on the basis of marks procured in the University examination rather than an entrance test. After counselling, a large number of students had opted for the institute and now, the fate of around 100 hangs in balance. Meanwhile, the higher education directorate informed that it would assign power to the college staff to withdraw money from the college fund so that a case may be filed in the high court for a relief. “NCTE has informed that since the last date for filing a reply had lapsed long back, it is only the court which can pass an order to revert the decision,” an official of the higher education directorate said on condition of anonymity. After a delayed admission process, offline classes started on March 1. However, the students soon found out that the recognition of the college was long cancelled. The students wrote to various officials in the education department and also sought time from the Governor to discuss the issue. Unable to get any concrete assurance, the students locked the college gate on Thursday and sat on a dharna. Alok Ranjan Chaubey, a student of the college, said, “The government mislead us by announcing the admission process for this college. We are among the top performers in the University and would have opted other training college had we known about goof up.” Notably, in 2019, NCTE had asked for details from the college on its faculty, building plan and building completion certificate and the financial position. Since it received no reply, the affiliation was withdrawn. An official of the college, not willing to be named, said the college fulfils all the criteria required for recognition and there must have been a mistake by someone in not sending the reply. It may be stated here that the college is also recognised as an institute for advanced studies. However, the college does not have a regular principal and its affairs are looked after by Usha Pandey, a faculty at the college. Pandey said, “Whatever be the reason for the de-recognition we have to find a solution. Presently, the college is locked and we sit outside the building.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/students-left-in-lurch-after-ncte-cancels-affiliation-of-teachers-training-institute/articleshow/81608735.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The panel has planned to station 732 companies during the first phase of polling on March 27, but the deployment figure may go up. The EC full bench is expected to visit Kolkata on Tuesday and a team may take a trip to Siliguri to find out the situation in North Bengal. The panel has laid special stress on confiscation of illegal money and liquor. Bengal has recorded seizure of narcotics worth Rs 49.38 crore. The EC seized cash to the tune of Rs 30.17 crore, liquor worth Rs 12.04 crore and gold and other precious metals worth Rs 6.2 crore. Other items like sarees, mobile phones worth around Rs 38.43 crore have also been seized. The EC has resolved over 5,000 complaints in the past 24 hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ec-mulls-extra-cover-for-first-phase/articleshow/81610040.cms||---

In a bid to increase the inoculation turnout, the state government has allowed panchayat bhavans to administer the vaccine. The inoculation drive at panchayat bhavans will be conducted in three phases and it will continue till March 27 with two days off in between. The turnout at panchayat bhavans was pretty good, according to Palamu civil surgeon John F Kennedy. “As many as 30 people were vaccinated at Pipra panchayat bhavan by noon,” Kennedy said. Sources said that response at Rudwa panchayat bhavan was disappointing due to the lack of proper awareness among the beneficiaries. Kennedy said that they will conduct more awareness drives for increasing the turnout. Meanwhile, there were some issues among the beneficiaries regarding the date of the second dose of the vaccination. For instance, those who took the shot at Dinadaag panchayat bhavan were asked to come for their second dose on April 18 while those at Bhabhandi primary health centre were asked to come on April 17. There needs to be a gap of 28 days between the first and second shot. Kennedy said that the nurses present at the session sites must have miscounted. Those who took the shot on Saturday have to take the second dose on April 17, he added. Meanwhile, at Dinadaag panchayat bhavan, those who were waiting to take the shot and those who were already vaccinated were waiting in the same room when, according to inoculation protocols, those vaccinated need to sit in the observation room. Later, upon Kennedy’s intervention, those waiting for their vaccination turn were taken out of the observation room and made to sit in an adjoining area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/palamu-begins-vax-drive-at-269-panchayats/articleshow/81608803.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Lockdown inevitable if Holi celebrations go wild: Health experts||RANCHI: With new Covid-19 cases breaching the three-digit mark in Jharkhand again after a gap of almost two months, healthcare experts and doctors have cautioned people against celebrating Holi carelessly, saying any laxity to adhere to Covid-19 safety protocols could lead to a spiralling increase in new infections. The warning comes at a time when Jharkhand, along with Maharashtra, Punjab, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal, Telangana and several other states, has reported a high caseload in recent days. Significantly, thousands of people, particularly migrant workers, return home from these states for Holi. On Friday, the state's daily caseload stood at 105, the highest since January 20. The healthcare experts said the development should serve as a warning and people should take utmost care, particularly during the festival of colours, which is usually celebrated with social gatherings and community meetings. The number of active Covid cases in Jharkhand rose by more than 50%, from 428 on February 6 to 653 on Friday. Ranchi has been the worst-affected district in the state, accounting for 365 of these while East Singhbhum has 108 active patients. While the Jharkhand government is yet to release any guidelines or restrictions for Holi festivities, the experts warned that the festival could become a super-spreader event if people flout rules amid wild celebrations. The neighbouring states of Bihar and Odisha have recently imposed a ban on Holi Milan and public celebrations fearing a second wave of Covid-19. They suggested people should stay indoors and use technology to wish their near and dear ones to avoid physical proximity. Talking to TOI, Dr Pradeep Bhattacharya, head of Rims trauma centre and professor of the institute's critical care department, said, “We were not expecting a rise in the number of cases in Jharkhand, but we now need to be very careful and avoid any kind of physical contact during the celebrations. In my opinion, people can put tilak of colours while wearing masks.” Dr Dewesh Kumar, public health expert and professor of community medicine at Rims, said, “If people do not realise the seriousness of this virus and if they do not follow protocols, the state will be forced to go for another lockdown after Holi, like Maharashtra, which has reported a massive surge, is conemplating. I urge people to stay indoors, celebrate with family members and send greetings using social media platforms. There should not be any crowding and physical contact while celebrating Holi as it might act as the bridge to pass the virus from an infected to a healthy person.” On the precautions needed to be taken during Holi, Dr Neha Rani, dermatologist and assistant professor at skin and hair department at Hazaribag Medical College and Hospital, said, “Holi this year is going to be completely different due to Covid-19 and people should refrain from going out and playing with colours. If unavoidable, people should moisturize their skin with either coconut oil or a lotion beforehand. They should not use synthetic colours and go for organic ones. They can also apply hair oil before playing.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/lockdown-inevitable-if-holi-celebrations-go-wild-health-experts/articleshow/81608757.cms||Gaurav Pandey
---||Kolkata||Bengal elections 2021: Take political appointees off civic boards, says Election Commission||KOLKATA: The Election Commission, in an order on Saturday evening, asked for the removal of administrators or board of administrator (BoA) members who are political appointees so that there’s a level-playing ground and the model code of conduct was not affected. In Bengal, there are over 100 civic bodies whose terms have expired and many of them are being run through political appointees, either by administrators or the BoA. The poll panel has sought a compliance report by 10am on March 22 (Tuesday). Earlier, there were plans by the Trinamool-run BoA of Kolkata Municipal Corporation that its chairman Firhad Hakim would resign as he was a candidate from Port constituency, where polling will be held on April 10. KMC’s board officials Atin Ghosh is also a candidate while Debashis Kumar is contesting from the Rashbehari seat. In Siliguri, Asok Bhattacharya, the CPM candidate from Siliguri, is also the chairman of the Board of Siliguri. The EC has directed that a committee headed by the chief secretary and having principal secretary (urban development) and principal secretary (personnel) as members appoint government officials by replacing the political appointees. Tarak Singh, member of BoA of KMC, said: “The matter is already pending before the Supreme Court and we are functioning as per SC directives to deliver services to the citizens during this pandemic.” The panel said the main aim was to satisfy that the model code of conduct was not affected, for which political appointees need to be removed. “Chief secretary to ensure a level playing field in all other municipal bodies in the state of West Bengal by rigorous reviews of their decisions which can disturb the level playing field,” the EC said. Poll panel officials felt that the BoA being political appointees might give an adverse impression among voters about free and fair polls. The replacement decision was taken to tackle the legitimate apprehension of voters about the fairness and impartiality of the election process, it said.  BJP had earlier made a demand to the EC for removal of political appointees from civic bodies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/take-political-appointees-off-civic-boards-says-ec/articleshow/81610026.cms||---

The protestors also accused Chas circle officer Dilip Kumar, who was at the demonstration site to pacify them, of misbehaving with them and threatening to thrash them if they don’t disperse. Kumar, however, denied that he had spoken harsh words but said he was only trying to calm down the protesters. According to the protestors, the DAV management must provide the cards without paying admission and activity fees. Sunita, a protesting parent said, “We are ready to pay the monthly tuition fees, but the school management is asking for the admission fees of the last academic year during the coronavirus period. They are also charging activity and library fees among others. They are not giving us the report cards unless we pay the whole amount. How can we pay such a hefty amount in this period of the pandemic?” The school’s principal-in-charge, Anupam Bhatnagar, refuted the allegations and said the school is giving away the report cards even to those who have not paid the fees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/parents-protest-against-bokaro-school-for-withholding-report-cards/articleshow/81608814.cms||---
---||Kolkata||CID takes over probe into Nandigram ‘attack’ on Mamata Banerjee||HALDIA/ KOLKATA: The CID on Saturday took over investigations into “incidents” that led to chief minister Mamata Banerjee sustaining “grievous injuries” on March 10. The state agency will probe a specific FIR lodged with Nandigram police against “unknown persons” who allegedly caused the injuries. The development coincides with rising political temperatures in Nandigram in the run-up to polling in the constituency on April 1. Both Trinamool Congress and BJP have moved the Election Commission, seeking a thorough probe into the alleged attack on Banerjee. The parties have also sought a separate probe into sporadic clashes on Wednesday and Thursday, in which several leaders and workers were injured. Banerjee, who addressed six rallies in East Midnapore district on Friday and Saturday, frequently lashed out at “traitors” without naming her opponent Suvendu Adhikari. On Saturday, she addressed a rally in Khejuri, adjacent to Nandigram, urging people to “stand guard against traitors” and stop them from taking to “hooliganism”. “I will be in Nandigram from Dol. I will rent a place. I have several programmes,” Banerjee said. It is expected that the CM will reach Nandigram, along with several senior Trinamool leaders and actor-MPs, for a high-decibel campaign, which will include two roadshows that she will lead in a wheelchair. At her Haldia meeting on Saturday, Banerjee said: “I had lavished blind affection on them and this is what they do to me. What is more shocking is that they have been in touch with BJP since 2014. If this isn’t treachery, what is? Good that they are now gone. I will come here whenever I want. Earlier, I had to take permission to come here.” Referring to party leaders who have been imprisoned, the CM said: “People whom they didn’t like have been put behind bars. Milon Mondal stepped out on bail on Saturday after two years. Anisur (Rehman) is still in jail. Who is Anisur? He was the one who drove me to Nandigram on his motorcycle when CPM had attacked me and blocked roads.” Countering Adhikari’s ‘tolabaj’ jibes, she said: “The person I had been affectionate towards is the biggest tolabaj of them all. He has now gone to another party. Trinamool didn’t endorse his work; so, to save his money, he has joined BJP. He has gone there to save himself from imprisonment.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cid-takes-over-probe-into-nandigram-attack-on-didi/articleshow/81610013.cms||Suman Mandal

---||Kolkata||PM Narendra Modi slams Bengal’s ‘Mafia Inc’, ‘nephew single-window system’||KHARAGPUR: PM Narendra Modi on Saturday raised the pitch against CM Mamata Banerjee and her nephew, Diamond Harbour MP Abhishek Banerjee, calling upon Bengal’s voters to put an end to the regime’s “school of brutality”, whose syllabus revolved around “tolabaji (extortion), syndicate raj and anarchy”. Modi, addressing a poll rally at Kharagpur’s BNR Maidan where he was flanked by 19 of the BJP’s candidates from the region (Bengal’s south-western corner), mentioned “Bengal’s mafia udyog” and “the prevalent bhaipo (nephew) single-window system” to ask voters to overthrow the Trinamool government. “There will not be bhoy (fear) this time; there will be joy (victory),” he said, exhorting voters to vote without fear and the administration and cops to work without bias. The BJP won the Kharagpur Town assembly seat in 2016 but the Trinamool wrested it in the subsequent ass-embly bypoll in 2019. “Didi has betrayed the poor, the Adivasis and the backward classes and turned her government into a loot-mar government. Adivasis and those living off the forest have to give cut-money for even selling kendu leaves,” he said. “The nation is progressing towards a single-window system but here, Bengal, only the bhaipo single-window system works. Nothing can happen without passing through this window. Existing industries are shut because of Trinamool syndicates,” Modi added. Alluding to Friday’s social media snag, he said: “WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram applications were down yesterday for 50-55 minutes. People did not know what to do. Here, in Bengal, vikas, biswas and sapna (development, trust and dreams) have been down for 50-55 years.” Modi repeated his jibes against CM Banerjee for opposing the New Education Policy and his efforts to teach technical and professional courses in the mother tongue. “The NEP proposes to impart technical, medical education in regional languages. But Didi is against this. She is not bothered about the future and career prospects of Bengal’s youth. The education scene in Bengal is in a mess, the government has handed over teachers’ recruitment to a Trinamool-run board,” he said. Modi then appealed to the people to give the BJP a chance this time and promised to set things straight. “We will do what others have not done during the past decades. Khela sesh hobe, vikas arambha hobe (The games will stop, development will start),” he added. He also repeated why Bengal needed a “double-engine sarkar” for development. “Didi has come in the way of Ayushman Bharat and PM Kisan Samman Nidhi, depriving people of the benefits of free medical support and funds that people elsewhere have got. We gave money to the state government for building 33 lakh houses. The state government has been sitting on that money and has built only 1 lakh houses,” Modi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pm-slams-bengals-mafia-inc-nephew-single-window-system/articleshow/81610053.cms||Sujoy Khanra

The three-day session held from March 18, 1940, gave a new direction to India's freedom struggle. In her video message for the utsav, AICC president Sonia Gandhi said the historic session was held when fascism and nazism were throttling democracy, civil liberties and pluralism. She said, "The Indian National Congress was at the forefront in the battle for a new India." Addressing the function, state Congress president Rameshwar Oraon said the party had struggled for freedom against the British after Independence, it brought revolutionary changes in all sectors under the leadership of the party's freedom fighters. Congress legislative party leader Alamgir Alam said the freedom struggle intensified after the Ramgarh session. "This district holds great significance in India's freedom struggle," he said.

---||Kolkata||West Bengal assembly polls: BJP ‘scared of Didi’, resorting to unfair means, says Mamata Banerjee||HALDIA (EAST MIDNAPORE): Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Saturday accused the BJP of resorting to unfair means to win the polls bec-ause “they fear Didi”. “They can’t fight me politically so they have resorted to everything. They are using money to buy votes. Intimidating people with raids and arrests. They are dictating whom we should worship, what we should eat. They fear Didi. For now, India is waiting for Bengal. Once they are routed in Bengal, they know they will face a similar fate in other states too,” Banerjee said. She also took a dig at PM Modi, calling him a “boddo baro neta (a big leader)”. “Today he (Modi) has named a stadium after himself. One day he will want to rename India after him.” In her sharpest retort yet to Modi’s repeated ‘tolabaj (extortionist)’ jab, Ban-erjee accused the PM of usurping the money raised to battle the raging pandemic. “Covid er nameh tullo taka, Narendra Modi korlo faka. PM Care er taka gelo kothaye? ( (Modi has appropriated the money raised to fight Covid. Where has the PM Care fund gone?),” she asked, adding that “they are the biggest tolabaj”. The PM Cares Fund was created on March 27, 2020 to combat and contain the coronavirus outbreak in the country and consists entirely of voluntary contributions from individuals and organisations. “Why haven’t they provided for mass vaccination? I had written to the Centre to allow us to buy vaccines. We can’t procure it on our own, it is done by the Centre. I said we will buy vaccines for all our 10-crore people. But they will not allow it. Why?” Banerjee said, urging people to wear masks since Covid cases are rising again. “During the Bihar elections, they promised to vaccinate all for free. Has it been done in these past months? It is very easy to brand a poor man thief for stealing Rs 500. But what happens when lakhs and crores are being siphoned off?” Banerjee said. The Trinamool Congress chief and her nephew and MP Abhishek Banerjee also slammed the PM for his jibe that while 50 minutes of digital disruption on Friday evening had sent millions into a flutter, people in Bengal have suffered 50 years of lack of development. “The PM knows that Facebook, WhatsApp were down for 50 minutes. But does he know about the death of migrant workers or even Hathras? Their politics is all about Facebook and WhatsApp, but we fight on the streets with the people. They speak of double-engine; it will be double-corruption from Kolkata to Delhi,” Abhishek said at a rally in West Midnapore’s Daspur. In Haldia, Mamata Banerjee brandished her government’s much-feted social schemes to counter the PM: “Ask Narendra Modi, has he heard of Swasthya Sathi? Has he heard of Khadya Sathi? Why doesn’t he do something about the spiralling costs of cooking gas, diesel, and petrol. It is even difficult to get kerosene. We may provide you free ration, but now you need to buy cooking gas for Rs 800 to make rice.” She added that the BJP was making absurd allegations (“abol tabol bokchhe”) since “they can see no development in Bengal and are jealous of Bengal”.

No one was injured in the fire, which took around half an hour to be doused. The train resumed its journey after around two hours, when the luggage coach was detached from the other rakes. An investigation is underway to ascertain the exact cause of the fire. This is the second such incident in a span of a few days. Last week, a fire had broken out in a passenger coach of the Delhi-Dehradun Shatabdi Express near Kansro in Uttarakhand. All passengers were evacuated and the coach was detached to douse the fire. “Around 6.40am, the Lucknow-bound Shatabdi had to stop at Ghaziabad after smoke started coming out of the luggage coach. By the time the doors were cut open, the luggage were in flames. The fire tenders had to be called,” said Kuldeep Tygai, the station master of Ghaziabad. Sunil Kumar Singh, the chief fire officer, said they had to bring out all the luggage to stop the flames from spreading. “Six fire tenders from Kotwali brought the flames under control after about half an hour,” he added. Senior officials also reached the Ghaziabad railway station and took stock of the situation. Ashutosh Gangal, general manager of Northern Railway, said, “The luggage coach was detached to stop the fire from spreading to other coaches. Electric supply was also cut off as a precautionary measure. No one was injured and the train left for its destination around 8.20am.” There were reports that a huge quantity of sanitizers was in one of the bags in the luggage coach. “This is subject to investigation and a forensic team has collected the samples. We are also checking CCTV footage at Delhi railway station to find out lapses, if any” said Gangal. “A high-level committee has also been set up to investigate the matter,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/luggage-coach-of-lko-shatabdi-on-fire-none-injured/articleshow/81609470.cms||---

Assessments were exchanged on the peace process and the ground situation, as also the concerns and interests of regional powers and neighbours,” sources said. The India-US conversation comes amid indications that the Biden administration may be pushing back its withdrawal date from May to November with the US President recently noting that the previous Trump administration had not thought through the plan sufficiently. While India has been in vited to a UN-organised meeting on Afghanistan to be held in the coming weeks, the US effort to push for an interim government in Kabul with members of the Taliban in it has caused some concern in New Delhi. A meeting in Moscow on March 18 kept India out of the deliberations but a statement issued afterwards asked the Taliban to not launch their spring offensive. Its not yet clear whether the terror group will actually abide by it. All eyes now will be on the forthcoming meeting between Afghan government representatives and Taliban organised by Turkey, as specified by US secretary of state Anthony Blinken in his letter to Afghan President Ashraf Ghani. Haneef Atmar, the Afghan foreign minister, is due to visit India on Monday for talks with the Indian government on the evolving situation in that country. Other senior Aghan leaders have preceded him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/us-def-secy-jaishankar-discuss-afghanistan-ground-situation/articleshow/81611726.cms||Indrani Bagchi

---||Hyderabad||MLC poll results: TRS claws back, downer for opposition||HYDERABAD: The sweet victory in the graduates MLC elections could not have come at a better time for the TRS which has been fighting with its back to the wall after the debacle in Dubbak bypoll and not so great show in GHMC polls. The face-saving wins, as poll analysts put it, came at a time when the opposition parties have started trumpeting that the ruling party is losing ground and that resentment among government employees and unemployed youth is brewing against the party. The party believes the wins will help ace Nagarjuna Sagar assembly bypoll. By winning the Hyderabad-Rangareddy-Mahbubnagar (HRM) and Warangal-Khammam-Nalgonda (WKN) seats, the TRS will also try to nullify the gains made by the BJP in Dubbak and GHMC polls. Party leaders will now go to people claiming that the BJP’s victory in Dubbak was only a stroke of luck and that there was no antiincumbency in the state. Not just this, the TRS took revenge on the BJP by wresting its sitting (HRM) seat. “Victory of TRS candidates in the MLC polls is a slap in the face of opposition parties. They tried to spread lies on the government. But, graduate voters elected our candidates and reposed their faith in chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao’s leadership. They also voted for developmental and welfare activities being taken up by the TRS government,” Hyderabad incharge minister Talasani Srinivas Yadav said. Party leaders said Saturday’s win will certainly boost the morale of the party cadre, who were down and out after the reverses in Dubbak and GHMC elections. Party sources said the leadership was sure about winning the WKN seat, but the victory margin came as an icing on the cake. “We were a little apprehensive in HRM constituency as our campaign started late due to delay in announcement of the candidate. There was also a dilemma whether we will contest or not. We made quick strides due to the strategy worked out by KCR and working president KT Rama Rao,” a party general secretary said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/mlc-polls-results-trs-claws-back-downer-for-opposition/articleshow/81611764.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Business||House panel seeks reduction in fuel taxes as prices soar||NEW DELHI: The parliamentary panel on food and consumer affairs has recommended a cut in fuel taxes at a time when petrol and diesel prices, included by the government in the list of essential commodities, are at record high levels. “The committee are (sic) of the opinion that the taxes levied on petroleum products, especially on petrol and diesel, are on the higher side and need a revision after making an evaluation of the prevailing pricing regime in the country and also making a comparative assessment of the same with systems prevailing in other countries,” the panel headed by TMC’s Sudip Bandopadhyay has said in its report submitted to Parliament on Friday. The report echoes the sentiment of consumers, who have been clamouring for tax relief since petrol price shot past the Rs 100 per litre-mark in several cities on February 17 as high Central taxes amped up the sharp rise in international crude price. Petrol price would have exceeded Rs 103 per litre in Mumbai and hit a century across large parts of the country had the state-run fuel retailers not frozen price revisions since February 27, a day after assembly polls were announced in five states. Diesel, used by transporters and farmers, is also ruling above Rs 85 a litre in most parts. The report said between financial years 2010-11 and 2018-19, the Centre’s excise duty collection from petroproducts grew from Rs 76,547 crore to Rs 2.29 crore, while customs duty collection increased from Rs 26,282 crore to Rs 39,123 crore. In 2020 alone, the Centre had raised excise duty on petrol cumulatively by Rs 13 per litre and diesel by Rs 16 in two tranches on March 16 and May 5 to tap the benefit resulting from crude prices collapsing to $20/barrel as demand evaporated due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Excise duty and VAT levied by states currently account for about two-thirds of retail prices. High fuel taxes pushed up excise duty mop-up by 48% in the April-November 2020 period to Rs 1,96,342 crore against Rs 1,32,899 crore in the previous corresponding period, while collections under other heads lagged due to the pandemic. On bringing petrol, diesel, jet fuel and natural gas under the GST regime, the panel quoted the government as saying under present law, it is for the GST Council to recommend a date for such inclusion. “So far, the GST Council has not made any recommendation for inclusion of petrol and diesel under GST,” the report says||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/house-panel-seeks-reduction-in-fuel-taxes-as-prices-soar/articleshow/81611788.cms||Sanjay Dutta

---||Vijayawada||Two held for rape & murder of Andhra Pradesh woman||VIJAYAWADA: Two persons were arrested on Saturday for allegedly raping and murdering a married woman in Tunikipadu village under Gampalagudem mandal of Krishna district.  The accused were identified as Gajjela Narasimha Rao, alias Narasaiah, and his uncle Gajjela Murali Krishna. Tiruvuru circle inspector M Sekhar Babu said the incident happened on March 14 at around 12 noon when the 30-year-old married woman was returning home from a chilli field. The main accused, Narasimha Rao, had allegedly been harassing her and demanding sexual favours for a long time but the woman had vehemently rejected his advances. On the day of the crime, he found her returning from the alone and found the place to be secluded to take advantage of the situation. He forcibly dragged her inside the field where he allegedly raped her. Fearing that she will inform others about the incident if she was allowed to go, he then used her sari to strangulate her. Not knowing what to do next, he contacted his uncle Murali Krishna to help him dispose of the body, but they eventually fled from the scene when they saw some people coming that way. The locals noticed that she was unconscious but still alive and informed her family members, who took her to Khammam government hospital where she passed away the same night. Her family members, who were aware of Narasimha Rao's harassment, lodged a complaint against him. Police launched a manhunt for the accused and managed to nab both of them while checking vehicles at Penugolu village on Saturday. A case has been registered against the accused. They were produced at a local court, which remanded them in judicial custody.

The notification for the April 6 election was issued on February 26. Sales of cellphone covers and cases and night lamps with imprints of logos of almost all party symbols, including those of national outfits, have grown by more than 30%, says Karthic Gurnani, founder of e-commerce dropshipping platform Baapstore. On the other hand, Chennai-based JK Stainless, a wholesaler, has seen orders for ‘kudams’ and cookers down by 30% with the Election Commission trying to keep a hawk eye over political parties. It is common practice for candidates touring their constituencies to distribute ‘gifts’ to keep field workers in good humour and butter up voters. The gifts, when not accounted for, go into EC logs as ‘bribes’. “The runway time from announcement to polling is short. Some parties have picked up T-shirts, but overall, sales have plummeted. Besides, the costs have risen too. A simple T-shirt used to cost around Rs 70. It’s now 110,” said Tirupur Exporters Association chief Raja Shammugam. DMK worker Constantine Ravindran says spending on merchandise has significantly reduced. But there’s still good demand for printed phone covers and cases, bluetooth headsets, and night lamps.Tirupurbased Bhaskar V, proprietor of Vijay Sports that sells custommade T-shirts, caps and towels to parties, said two parties had placed orders for Rs 7 lakh worth of T-shirts, which is half the previous election’s sales. Vedha V, a 61-year-old Chennai resident, said people in her neighbourhood had in the 2019 LS polls received cookers, saris and veshtis. “There’s hardly anyone at our doorstep this year. Looks like the EC’s strict vigilance is as big a scare as the coronavirus itself. It seems to have scared off even the TN politicians,” she joked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ec-hawk-eye-forces-parties-to-change-gifts/articleshow/81611824.cms||Mamtha Asokan

---||Lucknow||Sunni Board intervenes in SC PIL challenging Places of Worship Act||AYODHYA: An application for intervention in a PIL challenging the constitutional validity of Places of Worship Act, 1991, was filed in Supreme Court on Saturday by a mosque committee backed by UP Central Sunni Waqf Board. The intervention petition was filed by the counsel of Indo-Islamic Cultural Foundation, Sarim Naved, with advocate on record, Kabir Dixit, on behalf of Wasif Hasan of the mosque committee of Lucknow’s Teeley Wali Masjid. Last Sunday, TOI had reported on Sunni Waqf Board’s plan to defend mosques, including Kashi and Mathura, through legal intervention. On March 12, Supreme Court sought the Centre’s response on a PIL filed by BJP spokesperson Ashwini Upadhyay, challenging the constitutional validity of the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991, which was upheld by the apex court in its November 2019 Ayodhya judgment. PIL a design to polarize the nation: LawyerPetitioner Wasif Hasan, co-mutawalli of the 350-year-old Teeley Wali Masjid, Lucknow, told TOI that the PIL is a mischievous attempt to isolate Muslims and build a false narrative that Muslims are invaders and are less a part of this country than other communities. All historic mosques, temples, gurudwaras, churches are part of our shared legacy, he said. Talking to TOI, advocate on record, Kabir Dixit, said, “The PIL is part of a design to polarize the nation. The language is malicious and seeks to distort Indian history. Apart from lacking legal basis, the PIL is an assault on Supreme Court’s Ayodhya verdict, which was meant to bring a quietus to a long-standing dispute of national significance. This petition seeks to undermine the sanctity of that sensitive judgment and attacks a key element of that judgment, namely unanimous findings of the court on Places of Worship Act. We are moving Supreme Court to put forth valid legal submissions.” Indo-Islamic Cultural Foundation secretary Athar Husain said, “Places of Worship Act gets its constitutional validity in the Ayodhya verdict and should be upheld. The apex court said, the law upholds the nation’s secular fabric and prohibits retrogression. By providing a guarantee for preservation of the religious character of places of worship as existed on August 15 ,1947, the Parliament furnished a constitutional basis to heal injustices of the past by providing confidence to every community that their places of worship would be preserved.”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sunni-board-intervenes-in-sc-pil-challenging-places-of-worship-act/articleshow/81611827.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

Thus far, it’s way ahead of its rivals. CPM had hit bull’s eye with the remixed version of the popular Bengali song ‘Tumpa sona’, asking people to join the rally at Kolkata’s Brigade parade ground. In its second avatar released recently, the song’s foot-tapping tune and its outlandish video were tweaked to woo the state’s young voters to cast their franchise in favour of the ‘jote (alliance)’ of the Left, Congress and Indian Secular Front (ISF). The song is a runaway hit yet again. Posters that the party would have certainly shunned ayear ago — those marketing ‘gopon-e rog saran (cure the disease secretly)’ services of fly-by-night sexologists to the ones advertising ‘chakri chai (want jobs)’ — have been transformed into posters seeking vote for CPM and also the alliance. The campaign festoons, too, are carrying only photos of young contestants —65% of them are below 40. The latest innovation is the ‘Halla Gaari’ from which street drama performers get dropped at the city’s prime locations and seek votes through their plays. Several Left intellectuals have been attending the performances. State committee member and a poll veteran, Ratna Dutta, says there are so many firsts this year that she has lost count. “But we are living at a time when we need to connect quickly with the masses, especially youngsters,” she told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/west-bengal/left-campaign-adds-zing-to-youth-appeal-of-candidates/articleshow/81611841.cms||---

If compared to the situation in the last two weeks of February, when the daily average ranged between 88 and 92, the number of cases has gone up by three times. As per the Covid-19 bulletin, big cities of the state are witnessing the rise. Lucknow recorded 115 new cases, Varanasi followed next with 34 cases. Other district which reported the cases in double digits are Moradabad (21), Firozabad (21), Gautam Budh Nagar (17), Meerut (14), Jhansi (13), Saharanpur (13), Kanpur (12), Bareilly (12) and Ghaziabad (10), accounting for 63% of new cases along with the top two Lucknow and Varanasi. ‘Cases will surge if Covid preventive steps overlooked’The gap between daily new cases and daily recoveries is also widening fast. On Saturday 123 persons recovered which is about one fourth of the new cases reported. As a result, the number of active infections is also increasing exponentially. Until March 16, the number of active infections remained below 2000. Compared to 2014 on March 17, the number of active cases was reported to be 2,774 on Saturday which is an increment of about 27% in four days. Experts urged people to follow covid-19 prevention protocol in letter and spirit in personal, social and economic interest. “Ignorance to preventive behavior will mean rise in cases. This will invite restrictions and curbs which is bound to lay a negative impact on the economy which is yet to recover from last year’s jolt,” said Dr Vishwajeet Kumar, public health researcher and commentator.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/new-coronavirus-cases-cross-400-in-up-after-two-months/articleshow/81611867.cms||Shailvee Sharda
